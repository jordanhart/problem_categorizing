{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love this camera - it's ACE !", "Author": "Captain Zoom", "ReviewID": "R404FMQG77M81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the majority of people looking for a \"pocket\" camera - they can stop looking. This will honestly do for pretty much everything you really need. It's the newly released little brother to the more expensive ZS10/TZ20.It is not perfect, of course, but even if you take a \"money no object\" approach to picking an upper premium compact camera - there is currently nothing on the market that is head and shoulders better than this - although there can always be a case made for different qualities.Big Zoom - checkGood \"glass\" on the front - yep, LeicaOptical Image Stabilisation - uh huh, works quietly and efficiently in the background making your shots less blurry.Good quality photos - sure - but with the caveat that a \"full on\" digital SLR will always do better. The photos come out are a nice colour (not too vivid - but also not too washed out) and they don't come out a funny colour under artificial lighting (some cameras can struggle and give you a funny tint under striplights or old fashioned tungsten bulbs).Noise levels - the \"speckly\" bits on photos that you sometimes get in dark conditions - is definitely there - especially at higher ISO's - but you get this problem in dim lighting conditions even with all compact cameras to a greater or lesser degree. Even if you get an SLR camera - even up to a year or so ago - you'll find that they aren't infallible to this either.HD Video - check, but in MPEG format. I think that this takes up more space than the newer AVCHD format on the SZ10/TZ18 -  but I would be wary of getting a camera that uses this format if you have an older PC or laptop and especially if you have a netbook - in case the hardware can't cope. I guess Windows XP/NT/2000 users should definitely be careful - and to a lesser extent even if you have a Windows Vista machines you might think twice - especially if you are on a laptop where the hardware will always be slower than the equivalent price PC.I have a mixture of laptops and netbooks running Windows 7 through to XP so didn't want to take the chance - especially as other family members and the kids will probably want to view some of the footage (family and my kids have the older machines whilst dad gets the upgrade LOL).I do wonder if the AVCHD format on the more expensive ZS10/TZ20 is going to be a bit of an evolutionary dead end - just as BLU RAY hasn't really taken off - even though it's technically better than DVD - most people even if they have a big widescreen TV find that their DVD is fine (probably because the modern DVD players and TV's will upscale the DVD resolution to give a semi-HD picture quality). The ZS10/TZ20 I think gives you the option to record in both (I think I read that somewhere but if this a deal breaker you should check to be sure).If you only want a great point and shoot camera this is brilliant and has loads of options. Not only that but the options are really well laid out and easy to understand - by which I mean the dials and menus are set out in a common sense fashion and also instead of just little symbols/icons to indicate that you are in portrait mode or landscape mode - there is a little text underneath which tells you what it will do.I've had a number of Nikon's and Canon's - and for some reason they can still make cameras with menus and buttons that were laid out by Martians - they can be so unintuitive even for people who are really experienced photographers - and you have to keep referring to the instruction book to work out what to press or what menu icon you are looking for - and even then it doesn't stick in the memory because it's all so counter-intuitive.If you think you might - in a little while - like to step up in your photography later and get a bit more creative - or you are thinking of this a second camera to augment your SLR - then you'll want to know that this has A LOT of manual control thrown in which is pretty unusual in the compact camera class and it has Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Full Manual modes which is quite a rarity in the pocket camera class.If you are an experienced SLR user, I can tell you that the PASM options are pretty nicely implemented. Sensibly placed access buttons (the small round exposure button and Q Menu buttons to the right of the screen do this) and the menus are nicely set up to easily access the bits you want for Aperture / Shutter priority / full manual control. It'll never be as good as your SLR but you can't carry that around with you this easily and it won't shoot HD video either (or probably not unless you have the latest generation).The 16x optical zoom is class leading. You can get really good close ups if you want to.You should only compare OPTICAL zoom when you are looking at different cameras and ignore the Panasonic advertising guys (or anybody else )who point to the overall 20x zoom - because if you include the quoted digital zoom - the extra 4x zoom basically just crops your optical zoom photo in camera - and your laptop software will do that - only better - though I guess it might be relevant if you don't want to be doing with all that and just need an \"okay\" sort of photo).It also has a really good wide angle lens - 24mm - which basically means you can get more scenery in the shot at the edges. The lower the number the better - and 24mm is currently the lowest I am aware of. The lower the number the more you can fit into the photo - so if you are looking at a nice panorama or want to take a photo with the whole table in the shot - you are more likely to get it with this lens than say if you compared it to other cameras - whose lens might start at 27mm, 28mm, 35mm. This small difference can be the difference between getting everything or maybe not quite getting everything into the shot that you want to.OVERALL it feels nice in the hand - and it is quite light. It has a cool solid feel metal body and all the buttons and switches feel like they will last.Of course none of this would be of any use if the photos weren't top notch ... but luckily they are in my opinion. Sure, you can get a little better photos perhaps - but bear in mind if you are reading other reviews - a lot of this is personal preference - like how you like your TV at home to be set up with brighter or more vivid colours or more contrast etc.In technical terms - compact cameras are never going to match SLR cameras - because their sensors just aren't as big. This is also one of the reasons that you get more \"noise\" (or speckly bits) in photos from pocket cameras. The camera reviewers who do this for a living always seem to forget they are reviewing a pocket camera - as they probably all have SLR's at home - and they get a bit obsessed about how the photo appears when you look up close with a magnifying glass. Surely most people simply look at their photo on their laptop/Mac/PC and go \"ooh that's nice\" before deciding whether to print it or not ?Bottom line - this gives great photos that I am more than happy with even compared with my SLR (a two year old Pentax K20) - and if you want a compact/pocket camera with the ability to take great scenery or panoramic shots and then also zoom really close on things as well then this will do a great job for you. I think you'll be pleased with this as your main or secondary camera. Try not to get too hung up on specialist reviews - a compact camera is never going to give you technical quality photos of a large SLR - but you can video with it and even the newer SLR's don't do that very well - though heaven knows why not - maybe they just have a slow escalation marketing policy and are going to deliver that to the market as the desire for SLR's with video capability increases. And remember that if you wanted a whopping great SLR you'd have got a whopping great SLR.Also - go and have a look at all the cameras \"in the flesh\" in a store - to see if the size suits you. There aren't any smaller camera's with this big a zoom, but there are plenty of camera's which are smaller and more pocket / handbag friendly.IF you consider the size too big then you should definitely look at other camera's, but if the huge range zoom is just what you are looking for (like me) - then this is for you I reckon (unless you have a strong loyalty for one or other brand in particular I guess).IF you really want lower noise on high ISO photos but don't want an SLR and still want the big zoom then do have a look around at the competition and check out the specialist website reviews.IF you just want a nice pocket camera that gives you nice photos - but you are on a budget then you should look at the outgoing models from all of the manufacturers - but do have a look at Fuji as they have currently (March 28th 2011) some nice deals on their outgoing models which would give you good zoom and reasonable photos eg Fuji Finepix with 10x zoom 12MP photos.And finally don't get hung up on the megapixels on a compact camera. The quality of the \"glass\" on the front of the camera is likely going to have just a big - if not bigger impact. Although there are exceptions - more expensive usually equals better glass. This is why getting a formerly $400+ camera which is currently being discounted due to a newer incoming model can be a worthwhile strategy - as the originally more expensive camera will generally have better quality lenses. Anything above 10MP is going to be fine 90% of the time - and more megapixels actually often means more grainy photos in darker conditions.PSHere's my snapshot on two good alternatives - although there are potentially important subtleties amongst them and numerous alternatives from other manufacturers like Pentax and Fuji. There are lots of minor but potentially irritating features out there such as how fast can they take photos - how do they perform in low light with the flash off - how realistic are the colours (which can definitely be a personal taste thing) - and also really important day to day things away from how good the camera is technically in delivering a good photo or video - eg are the buttons and switches and menus in just the right or wrong spot for you - and does it feel good in the hand to you - you may prefer a lighter camera, bigger or smaller buttons.Canon PowerShot SX210 has 14.1 MP and 14x zoom - has only a 28mm lens - which isn't too bad - looks a good bet and has pretty nice write ups. ISO goes up to 3200 if you look at the SX200 - though of course it'll probably give you a speckly ol' photo. FWIW I didn't think that the difference between 24 and 28mm on the wide angle zoom was that much of a difference - but having had it now for a while I have to say that there's no way I'd go back.Nikon CoolPix S 8100 has 12.1MP, significantly worse wide angle lens at 30mm so you won't be able to get so much scenery into the shot, only 10x zoom but is therefore smaller and more pocket / handbag friendly. It has a fast shooting 10 frames per second though the TZ18 can do similar job if not quite so fast. It has less manual control as it has no Shutter and Aperture Priority.ME ... personally ... I did have a good look at the SZ10/TZ20 and in fact nearly got it - but in the end I decided that it's a bit heavier (though not much) and I couldn't see that the extra money for Geo-Tagging and Stereo video sound were much use to me. I mean the stereo Mics are 5mm apart and worrying about the battery drain on the geotagging would have driven me crazy - constantly turning it on and off to save power ... and I figured that I would make do with simply remembering where I was when I took the photo. If I really want to know where I was at the time I take a photo of a road sign or landmark nearby ? Works for me anyway :o)I wanted big zoom - on a compact camera - with a wide zoom and I already have an SLR so this is perfect. Although there are no doubt one or two better cameras out there, they aren't that much better to make me worry.Good luck and have fun picking your camera.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Read 100's of reviews and settled for this one and love it.", "Author": "K. Gehrke", "ReviewID": "RV8KSBP4AMZ1Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera (in black) a few weeks ago with the Lowepro Ridge30 case Lowepro Ridge 30 Camera Case (Black) and Transcend 8GB Class 10 SDHC card Transcend 8 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC10E. I was tired of my old cameras not getting the right shot because they were never fast enough. That was my main criteria for purchasing this camera. After UPS dropped off the camera on a Friday, I took the kids to the park to see what it could do. The camera's ability to capture fast action shots is amazing. Kids coming down slides, crossing the monkey bars, or spinning on the merry-go-round...this captured them all crystal clear. Keep in mind, I did have to do some experimental shots first, but on fast action, set it to sports mode and fire away. Saturday was off to an outdoor Graduation. Again, the colors, ease of use, and quality of the shots was better than I was expecting. Sunday, we were off to the amusement park. I wore cargo shorts and the camera was in the side pocket all day wrapped in a napkin in a ziplock bag to protect it from rain and water rides. It took abuse from roller coasters to bumper cars. This is where I was stunned by the photos. I was able to take pictures of the kids on the roller coasters with their screaming, eyes wide open, hair blown back, \"I'm going to kill you dad for making me ride this\" expressions. See my pictures in the zs8-black photo's. BEAS62 has included some photos of closeups and the quality of the zoom. I have taken similar photos and had the same results. In my opinion, this is a great everyday-general use camera. As for the battery, I took 300 pictures between two weekends before it went to 'low battery'. Most shots (80%) were outdoor with no flash and most shots were turning the camera on and off to take 1-5 shots at a time.When I began this journey of trying to find a camera to take fast action shots, I was in the mindset that only a DSLR could achieve this. I have had, and used many others, in the past and have been let down. Finally I accepted that nothing was going to take these action shots without shelling out $800+. But I don't want to shell out that much, not now at least. Besides, I want a camera small enough to throw in my pocket during trips/events and not have it hanging from my neck shouting \"tourist\". The reviews on Amazon were not enough alone to convince me. The negative reviews, I felt, were lacking more detail. Some, I get it, you dropped the camera and panasonic wont fix it so now you bash them here. After weeding out the bashing, reading professional reviews on other sites, I had it narrowed down. I did have a spending limit of $250. What sold me was others recommending this one for the fast action shots, however, several of those reviewers did comment on poor low light pictures being grainy. Most of my pictures are outdoors or indoors with good lighting. I have taken several indoor photos and played with some of the scene modes. Quality indoor photos can be taken when the right scene mode is used. Auto mode does not always take the best picture. Use the different scenes for the appropriate picture. I feel many reviews are based on this Automatic picture setting. No camera I have seen will take the best pictures in Auto mode. This is not a $50 film camera of yesteryear. These are advanced electronics, the other modes are there because they take the best shots. Auto mode is there for those who don't want to stray away from the basics. Those folks are the ones who should not gripe. Mom...Dad...Grandpa...Grandma...I understand technology is too much for you, but if you are not willing to use the features as they are available or intended, don't review it based on your lack of fully testing the product. I may have passed up several better cameras because the ratings were by less-than-amateur users. I digress.What I like about the camera:  1.  24mm ultra-wide angle lens. No more backing up to get everything in the picture.  2.  12 element in 10 groups Leica lens. Well known high quality lens.  3.  16x optical zoom. This baby zooms and zooms. Equivalent to 24-384mm lens  4.  Intelligent Scene Selector sets the scene automatically. Played with a little and should be useful.  5.  Auto focus subject tracking detection. No need to keep pressing shutter button half-way to readjust focus. This helps  with the kids and fast action shots.  6.  Optical image stabilization, not electronic...keeps the quality of the picture during shaking.  7.  2 speed zoom, fast or slow depending on how fast you swivel the lever.  8.  720p HD motion video. Not the best, Its not 1080p but only blu-ray and some camcorders are. 720p is what your local  NBC/ABC/CBS networks broadcast.  9.  Face recognition. great for finding photos on your computer.  10. The buttons and menu. Easy to navigate and menu buttons have \"teeth\" so you know what/where you are pressing.  11. Instant on. From pressing power to 1st shot is like 1-2 seconds. Once the lens motors out, its ready. No waiting.What I don't like about the camera:  1.  Battery. Its a proprietary battery and needs to have the microchip. There are generics, but if it doesn't have the microchip to talk to the camera, the camera wont turn on. Beware on buying generic batteries.  2.  No viewfinder. Hard to see the lcd in direct sunlight, but then so is my smartphone and laptop. Not that big of a deal, as shots with direct full sun on screen are rare for me.When purchasing, I would recommend the Class 10 SDHC cards from a reputable company. Panasonic recommends at least a Class 6. For a few bucks more, get the Class 10. I have yet to wait for the the camera to 'write to disk' before taking the next shot. It is also fast enough for HD video, again, no waiting or buffering/glitching. As for cases, watch the sizes. I originally ordered the Lowepro Ridge 10 because the dimensions said it would fit. It didn't. I went to my local target and they had the ridge series. The 30 fits it with a little wiggle room to spare. The 20 would be too snug and risk breaking the zipper. The ridge 30 has a zipper for the camera, a flap and pouch that fit the charger (but barely, and I would not walk around with it in...just a good place to store it when it sits in the closet), and a zipper on the flap for an extra memory card or battery. Comes with shoulder strap and closed belt loop....more to come, I will update the zs8-black", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing quality and zoom feature", "Author": "texasbbj", "ReviewID": "R28V5LIKQ5ADN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the Z3 and this is my 3rd Lumix camera. I am a insurance adjuster and take over 300 pictures per day and these cameras get alot of heavy work and is constantly used in conditions that is not the average user.  What I wanted most from a work camera, was the ability to zoom in and the wide angle.  I take alot of photos on roofs where damages have occured and the ability of this camera to do those things, is unsurpassed.  The old one had a 12x zoom which I thought was great, until I used this 16x zoom. Quite amazing to say the least.  With your typical camera of this size, you might get a 5 zoom and you will just not believe the difference with this 16 zoom.  Next would be the 24 wide angle aspect.  Again, quite amazing.  I can stand 25 feet in front of a house and get the whole house in the photo.  With typical cameras, you would have to stand across the street.Next would be the picture quaility.

That's moving to a dedicated application and I wanted to take advantage of the additional zoom Panasonic offers for my \"daily\" camera. There are smaller, lighter cameras but this is the best combination with the longer zoom, everything smaller stops at about 5X.  This has an optical 16X and a very effective 20X.  The macro mode gives crisp,incredible close ups.A friend recently took his digital SLR and three lenses on a trip to Hawaii and ended up taking pictures with his cell phone because he didn't want to haul any of the photo gear on his touring. \"The best camera is the one you have with you.\"  This is easy to carry, even in a back pocket. It is too heavy for a front shirt pocket, but it's OK in a jacket pocket. I keep mine in an Amphipod model 670 Ballistic Trail Pouch which also has a belt loop if I want to use it and is large enough to hold a spare battery, though the battery life is fine in normal use.This isn't quite a \"point and shoot\" but it's close enough when the dial is set to \"i\" or \"intelligent\" mode where it figures out everything for you.  You just have to know to set it to the \"i\" setting if that's how you want it to work.My only beef with all these non SLR digitals is that even when set to scenery mode, where a fixed \"infinite\" focus would be fine, they still work to focus and there's no manual override.  A small concern and only occasionally problematic, such as when trying to take a picture of the moon.  You have to keep in mind that the flash falls off rapidly at about 10', but the images are good in limited light.This has a very effective image stabilization system, but as you move over about 10X with any of these cameras you need to be conscious of trying to hold still.If you want a utilitarian, easy to use, long zoom camera that takes terrific pictures, this is an excellent choice.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Remarkable image quality for a pocket camera", "Author": "beas62", "ReviewID": "R34YVI0IA8HKTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the ZS8 as an \"upgrade\" to my ZS7.  For my purposes, I wanted a decent quality pocketable camera with some reach. The ZS8 fits the prescription nicely. I wasn't overly concerned with video performance as that's something I rarely use, and neither was I too concerned about continuous frame rate. To meet the price point, the ZS8 video is \"downgraded\" from the ZS7's full HD to 720p and it doesn't share the blinding speed of it's big brother ZS10 which uses a totally different MOS sensor versus the ZS8's CCD. But the image quality is quite good and the zoom capability is remarkable for a pocket camera. So far, it is performing very well. One hint is that when you are shooting very fine detail in good light, you may wish to disable the iResolution. In regular use iResolution does improve the overall contrast, but at the expense of fine detail such as fine hairs or fibers things you'll only notice at a 100% crop.  The macro capability is astonishing on this camera.  I've come to refer to it as my \"pocket microscope\".

It took amazing pictures for two years, and I had become a fan of Panasonic cameras after also having used, albeit briefly, cameras like the ZS3 and the ZS7. The ZS8 looked much better on paper than all of its predecessors, but I was very disappointed with it in several respects, which ultimately made me return it.The first thing that I didn't like about it when I opened the package was its lightness. Don't get me wrong - lightness is usually a good trait in a point and shoot - but this camera just felt cheap, at some points hollow, almost. I also noticed how the materials used in its construction felt much cheaper and plasticky than those used in my TZ5.Upon turning it on, I was in for another bad surprise. Knowing that I was spoiled by my TZ5's 460k screen and my iPhone 4's high resolution display, I had set low expectations for the ZS8's 230k one, but it still seemed much fuzzier than I thought it would be and I found it hard to use to tell whether the camera had focused properly. I suppose you will not notice this if your previous camera had a 230k display, or if you had never used the iPhone 4's display, but for anyone who had, a 230k display these days on cameras is a no-no.But I could live with these shortcomings, and if the camera took good pictures, I was decided to keep it. A 20 minute photo shoot outside was a complete turn-off, however. The pictures looked worse than on my TZ5, but I thought it was only due to the ZS8's low resolution display, but even after loading them up on my computer, the ZS8's pictures looked worse and only sometimes of the same quality as those from my TZ5. I will admit, though, that I was pleasantly surprised by the zoom and the MEGA O.I.S stabilization on the ZS8: Even at the maximum zoom, it was very easy to take clear, shake-free photos. Other than this redeemable quality, I didn't like the pictures from the ZS8 at all. They had a lot of noise, were rather dull, had low dynamic range, and in general, although much larger in pixel count, not at all of better quality than those from the TZ5.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Would not buy again", "Author": "micheleg57", "ReviewID": "R1GHHES7UUIFLV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about 10 months ago and it took fair pictures.

For what I want, a high end camera that I can just point and shoot excellent pictures with without having to get way into the technical aspects of a camera menu it is just about perfect.  The camera is extremely intuitive in its' operation and settings and its' iA setting has handled everything I have thrown at it with great aplomb. I am replacing a TZ3 (giving the old one to a Grandchild) and I have to say the new camera feels much simpler, and the focus is noticeably easier and better and its' ability to fill in a flash picture without it looking like the light from the flash being a separate part of the photo is impressive.I got mine from Amazon seller 17th St Photo and the camera arrived poorly packed, rattling around in a larger box.  Not really professional, for sure.  In spite of this it seems OK.The software supplied with the camera seems to be the result of its' designer having a cerebral-rectal inversion of some sort.  It took over half an hour to install and had many glitches.  It informed me that my version of Quicktime was too new to work with the software.  It told me that it could not load the total of the package and therefore I would not be able to use the Photofun 6.0 program to stitch up or view panorama shots.  The promised software to upload photos to web sites turned out to be merely a link to a 30 free trial of a program you must then purchase...this last was a really sleazy bit, I thought.  Anyone can get the darn free trial, is my guess.I think I am going to try to delete all the stuff but the owner's manual from my computer if possible.  Perhaps this stuff is just not compatible with my computer ( a 3-4 year old fairly high end Dell).So it's kudus for the camera and thumbs down on the junk software they send with it.  You'd think for this kind of money, you'd get a printed owner's manual, but I guess that's too much to ask these days. In short, the new camera and it's design are really first class, marred somewhat by someone at Panasonic trying to cut corners on the total package.Oh yea, the darn cable to download pics to the computer is too short to be of much use unless you have a laptop...save your old one!

Keep in mind, I did have to do some experimental shots first, but on fast action, set it to sports mode and fire away. Saturday was off to an outdoor Graduation. Again, the colors, ease of use, and quality of the shots was better than I was expecting. Sunday, we were off to the amusement park. I wore cargo shorts and the camera was in the side pocket all day wrapped in a napkin in a ziplock bag to protect it from rain and water rides. It took abuse from roller coasters to bumper cars. This is where I was stunned by the photos. I was able to take pictures of the kids on the roller coasters with their screaming, eyes wide open, hair blown back, \"I'm going to kill you dad for making me ride this\" expressions. See my pictures in the photo's above. BEAS62 has included some photos of closeups and the quality of the zoom. I have taken similar photos and had the same results. In my opinion, this is a great everyday-general use camera. As for the battery, I took 300 pictures between two weekends before it went to 'low battery'. Most shots (80%) were outdoor with no flash and most shots were turning the camera on and off to take 1-5 shots at a time.When I began this journey of trying to find a camera to take fast action shots, I was in the mindset that only a DSLR could achieve this. I have had, and used many others, in the past and have been let down. Finally I accepted that nothing was going to take these action shots without shelling out $800+. But I don't want to shell out that much, not now at least. Besides, I want a camera small enough to throw in my pocket during trips/events and not have it hanging from my neck shouting \"tourist\". The reviews on Amazon were not enough alone to convince me. The negative reviews, I felt, were lacking more detail. Some, I get it, you dropped the camera and panasonic wont fix it so now you bash them here. After weeding out the bashing, reading professional reviews on other sites, I had it narrowed down. I did have a spending limit of $250. What sold me was others recommending this one for the fast action shots, however, several of those reviewers did comment on poor low light pictures being grainy. Most of my pictures are outdoors or indoors with good lighting. I have taken several indoor photos and played with some of the scene modes. Quality indoor photos can be taken when the right scene mode is used. Auto mode does not always take the best picture. Use the different scenes for the appropriate picture. I feel many reviews are based on this Automatic picture setting. No camera I have seen will take the best pictures in Auto mode. This is not a $50 film camera of yesteryear. These are advanced electronics, the other modes are there because they take the best shots. Auto mode is there for those who don't want to stray away from the basics. Those folks are the ones who should not gripe. Mom...Dad...Grandpa...Grandma...I understand technology is too much for you, but if you are not willing to use the features as they are available or intended, don't review it based on your lack of fully testing the product. I may have passed up several better cameras because the ratings were by less-than-amateur users. I digress.What I like about the camera:  1.  24mm ultra-wide angle lens. No more backing up to get everything in the picture.  2.  12 element in 10 groups Leica lens. Well known high quality lens.  3.  16x optical zoom. This baby zooms and zooms. Equivalent to 24-384mm lens  4.  Intelligent Scene Selector sets the scene automatically. Played with a little and should be useful.  5.  Auto focus subject tracking detection. No need to keep pressing shutter button half-way to readjust focus. This helps  with the kids and fast action shots.  6.  Optical image stabilization, not electronic...keeps the quality of the picture during shaking.  7.  2 speed zoom, fast or slow depending on how fast you swivel the lever.  8.  720p HD motion video. Not the best, Its not 1080p but only blu-ray and some camcorders are. 720p is what your local  NBC/ABC/CBS networks broadcast.  9.  Face recognition. great for finding photos on your computer.  10. The buttons and menu. Easy to navigate and menu buttons have \"teeth\" so you know what/where you are pressing.  11. Instant on. From pressing power to 1st shot is like 1-2 seconds. Once the lens motors out, its ready. No waiting.What I don't like about the camera:  1.  Battery. Its a proprietary battery and needs to have the microchip. There are generics, but if it doesn't have the microchip to talk to the camera, the camera wont turn on. Beware on buying generic batteries. Few will work, and panasonic charges an arm and a leg.  2.  No viewfinder. Hard to see the lcd in direct sunlight, but then so is my smartphone and laptop. Not that big of a deal, as shots with direct full sun on screen are rare for me.When purchasing, I would recommend the Class 10 SDHC cards from a reputable company. Panasonic recommends at least a Class 6. For a few bucks more, get the Class 10. I have yet to wait for the the camera to 'write to disk' before taking the next shot. It is also fast enough for HD video, again, no waiting or buffering/glitching. As for cases, watch the sizes. I originally ordered the Lowepro Ridge 10 because the dimensions said it would fit. It didn't. I went to my local target and they had the ridge series. The 30 fits it with a little wiggle room to spare. The 20 would be too snug and risk breaking the zipper. The ridge 30 has a zipper for the camera, a flap and pouch that fit the charger (but barely, and I would not walk around with it in...just a good place to store it when it sits in the closet), and a zipper on the flap for an extra memory card or battery. Comes with shoulder strap and closed belt loop....more to come.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "a great little camera!", "Author": "R.

With his help I was able to take amazing shots of animals in Costa Rica.He also showed me how to decrease the megapixels to save space and improve quality of some shots.  It's a great camera is what I am saying.  The basic booklet that is included really tells you how to turn it on and take routine shots, but not how to avail yourself of the real features of the camera.Without his help, I was going to return the camera as I had already put it away and started using my old Nikon Coolpix 6.0 megapixel with 3x zoom.

I've had lots of cameras over the years, and none has shown this kind of susceptibility to dust.  I keep it in it's own little pouch, zipped in, clean, and protected, so I feel like I've done due diligence in terms of care.  I've seen quite a few other complaints of this nature, too.  UPDATE: after taking a look at the amount of dust on other people's little pocket cameras, this one is VERY disappointing.  My mom has a little Casio zoom that she treats terribly.  The outside is filthy, but the photos are clean.  UPDATE#2: now I've had the camera for four months, and the amount of dust had built up the point where I didn't even want to bother using the camera at all.  I was ready to throw it away, seriously.  So I grabbed a screwdriver and figured I'd give a shot at taking it apart and cleaning it.  Turns out that's pretty easy, with a quality #000 phillips driver, it only takes about 15 minutes to open the case, remove a cover plate, remove the carrier holding the chip, and gently brush or blow off the dust.  That's good, because I'm sure I'll have to do it often.I also really hate the switch you have to flip to go between shooting and playback modes.  My Panasonic TS-1 doesn't have this, and too often I've grabbed the camera for a quick shot and found it stuck in play mode.The acceptable:  Image quality is fine.  It doesn't compare to the output from an SLR, but for a tiny little pocket camera with an equally tiny sensor, it does ok.  No pixel peeping at full resolution!  Unless you're shooting in ideal, bright conditions, noise and softness will be very apparent.  The autoexposure, auto-ISO, and other auto functions seem pretty smart.  It's a camera I mostly trust, which is saying a lot for me.The good:  Things like distortion, lens flare, and chromatic aberration are very very well controlled compared to cameras from a few years ago.  It is tiny and light, operates quickly, the video is very nice, and the image stabilization works very well, which is good because it's hard to hold such tiny cameras steady for stills or especially video.

So far, it hasn't disappointed.First for the cons:  Just like most (if not all) point and shoots, indoor pics and flash pics suffer a little.  The flash leaves a hard, metallic tone on the images and redeye is common.  The camera has a reduction mode, but I never use it, I find the 'double flash' confuses posing subjects and results in movement and akward facial expressions.  I also don't like that the proprietary battery has to be removed from the camera for charging.  So far, battery life is excellent, but I haven't kept track of how many pictures/flashes/image reviews I can do between plug ins. Lastly, the camera is a bit thicker than I would have hoped for.  Some of the comparable products on the market are considerably thinner.As for the pros:  the camera takes great, high resolution outdoor shots.  I've had good luck with automatic mode as well as Av, Sv and the various scene modes it offers.  Color balance is very accurate with WB set to automatic, although images captured with chosen WB settings  neon, indoor) came out well also.  I also like that the advanced user can dial up or dial down exposure by fractions of stops, and I believe the camera can autobracket as well, although I haven't tried it yet. Lastly, the menus and the user interface is very intuitive and easy to understand. If you've been around digital cameras for any length of time, you should be able to figure this one out without reading the users' manual.

At this point I've tried what seems like every P&S; digital camera known to man (except for a Fuji or Nikon).  I've had a Kodak, Samsung, several Sonys and 3 Canons.I've come to the conclusion that I'm just going to have to keep using my older model Sonys (a DSC-S75 and a DSC-V1) for regular everyday snapshots of people and pets, etc. and use my 2009 model Sony DSC-H20 for videos, since that model has great sound and video quality but can't seem to capture anything that moves in still photos.Anyway, the Panasonic ZS8 is a fast camera, it focuses and works well at capturing movement in kids and pets, etc.  After letting it sit around for several months after I bought it and used it lightly back in September, I decided to use it at Christmas 2011.  I was very disappointed in the image quality.When previewing the photos on a PC, they look OK at first until you zoom in at 100% in Photoshop.  Indoor photos taken in broad daylight in a brightly lit room had so much noise it looked like a painting!  I took a photo of my niece halfway across the room, using the zoom lens only about halfway, and the photo was blurry and grainy.  (Not blurry from me moving the camera, just smudgy from noise.)  At 100% in Photoshop, I could even see tiny greenish/black specks all over her arms and pink shirt!Also the colors seemed slightly washed out.  I think my Canon SD1200 takes better photos than this - at least the \"noise\" on that camera is more of a sandy looking grain, rather than the smudgy looking paint you get with this Panasonic.It seems like most of these newer point and shoot models do just fine outdoors in daylight, which is probably why I liked the ZS8 at first, since the only photos I took in September were outdoors in a green yard.But the real test is how they do indoors, and this one is not that great.  It's really no better than my Canon SD1200.  But this seems to be a common problem with all the newer P&S; models of the last few years, I keep reading the same thing over and over in the Amazon reviews about many different models and brands of cameras.  So I've pretty much stopped looking at any newer P&S; model cameras, until these stupid camera manufacturers STOP the megapixel war and start making cameras with fewer MP in a larger sensor.  How hard can that be?I know an SLR would probably give the best images, but I need something small enough to carry around, not that I expect it to be smaller than a deck of cards or something crazy like that.Pros of the ZS8:*  Sturdy build and design*  Good operation and relatively quick movement and focusCons:*  Photos are noisy & mediocre quality in low light or indoors*  Photos are more blurry when using zoom farther out*  Somewhat strange menu interface (why do the dial options show up with both \"Record\" and \"Setup\" menu options on the same screen?  In most cameras, the general setup menu is a totally separate menu option.)*  Rather odd combination of image sizes and aspect ratios.  You can't use the 3:2 aspect ratio for all image sizes, for example.*  Video mode is okay, although I found the image quality to be a little more grainy than on my Sony H20 or even my Canon sd1200.  Sound quality seemed okay, but I haven't tested it at a concert or anything that would really challenge it.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great decision", "Author": "Nurse Bill", "ReviewID": "R3WFH9T7F94KC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I have a little experience with photography, I am far from a good amateur. We own two digital cameras. We had been on two trips this year and the pictures taken on both were frustratingly affected by our camera's abilities (composure is very different from exposure and focus when those are supposed to be automatic). I was looking for a good camera that would take clear pictures (no matter what light), speedy on start-up and picture to picture, allow me a little flexibility, good battery life, but be easy for my wife (full auto mode).  I decided on this ZS8 (I consider a moderately priced camera).A week after getting it (very quickly with free shipping), we went to Niagara Falls. What a great decision! The camera starts up very quickly, there is very little lag between shots, and 99.9% of the pictures had focus that was sharp as a tack. The very few times the focus was poor, it was because of the situation and my impatience with allowing the second or two for the camera to focus. The stabilization system is spectacular! I was taking pictures of fireworks through a hotel window; the focus was sharp and the exposure was perfect. In the butterfly conservatory (a really fantastic place), my nature photographs - auto macro mode and exposure - were perfect. I bought an extra battery with this camera and was sure to have it charged and ready to go if necessary (I did not have to press it into service until the end of the trip - 300 pictures, some with flash).Nice size that fits my ham-hands without being large or impossible to carry/store. I had considered a similarly priced Canon and Sony and tried them in a local Best Buy with surprising results: Both of these cameras felt tiny in my hands. Both cameras had issues with taking focused pictures in less than perfect lighting (zoom to max on close object). The Panasonic was also available for my comparison and was really comfortable to use.Great camera.

I wrote an earlier gushing review of the ZS6, and I've even had a couple of photo's in Panasonic's \"Focus on Australia\" (a competition for Lumix users there - I spend about four months a year working down-under). But this will be my last. I'll switch my loyalty to Canon or Sony.Four months after I got the camera, it developed spots on the sensor. Very annoying, when you have to do a bunch of post-processing on every image, just to clean it up. I was away working, so I had to live with it for a couple of months. Contacted Panasonic on my return, and since the camera was obviously under warranty, they repaired (or replaced) it through their facility in Texas. Okay, ten months later, and the problem recurred. I contacted Panasonic immediately, and at this stage their position was that since it was over a year since the original purchase, it wasn't their problem. The fact that they had it in their hands ten months prior, and returned it to me in \"as new\" condition was neither here nor there. A quick check on their website showed that to have the repair facility look at it would cost $180.25 (plus postage & insurance) which given that you can pick one up second-hand for $100 is just ludicrous.Now bear in mind, it isn't an SLR, where the user can cause dust on the sensor by changing lenses in adverse conditions. And for that matter, with an SLR cleaning the sensor can be done easily. This is a sealed unit, so any ingress of pollutants is caused by a manufacturing defect. Either the lens seals are useless, or more likely, excess lubricant within the camera is spotting on the sensor.As consumers, we're groomed to expect that electronic items have a shelf-life of at most two or three years, and it is always better to replace with the latest model than to attempt a repair. I'm old fashioned - I think that something I spend two to three hundred dollars on should be durable, and more importantly it should be reliable.

SLR users might disagree on this point, but I honestly can't tell the difference between the clarity of this shot and ones taken without using any zoom at all. Further, another shot I took was of a motorcycle going down the road at around 45mph, and with just the intelligent auto it came out only a little blurry. I have since been impressed by the sports setting (which allows multiple shots to be taken in quick succession and with a shorter shutter speed, so you can get those split second shots) so I can only imagine what that bike would have looked like with the sports setting.The software that comes with the camera is also fairly impressive. It's nothing compared to Photoshop, for example, but for an application that is included with the camera it does very well. I've used it several times to clean up shots or enhance particular colors in a shot. Another point of note is that the software comes with its own panorama stitching option and does a marvelous job with it. There's also a panorama assist setting on the camera itself, which really helps when trying to make a panorama shot.Granted, this is the first digital camera I've owned, and granted that I am very much an amateur at this, but this is one of the best cameras I've ever seen and have been complimented several times by people more experienced in photography.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "DUST", "Author": "rm", "ReviewID": "R27HXM4OQ5WAN0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Love the picture quality.

First and foremost, it has the same (if not better) user-friendliness that I've gotten used to from the earlier Lumix cameras. Second, it performs even better than the previous model. What used to be a 10x optical zoom is now an incredible 16x optical zoom. WHat used to be 9.1 megapixels is now 14.1 megapixels. Furthermore the size and weight of the ZS8 is more compact than ever before, smaller than a cigarette pack. If these improvements continue, I imagine that in another 3 years or so it'll be the size and weight of my BlackBerry Bold.Last but not least, I was really floored when I saw at what an amazingly low price Amazon was selling the ZS8. If my memory serves me right, it was/is about half the price I paid for the TZ5 just 3 years ago. Wow, just wow.

I was completely disappointed with the SD780 not being user friendly needing tweaks here and there, video specially at night was bad which the prior 8MP Canon did without problem. Hence, my switch to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 which has none of these problems! The auto mode takes wonderful pictures and the flash at night is much better not washing out the entire photo or taking away color. Even without the flash in low light the photos are great and the stabilization helps to not blurr the photos! The night video is better than the SD780 and comparable to the prior Canon 8MP. I have a friend who is a professional photographer who suggested the Lumix and I couldn't be happier. I'm using a Duracell High Speed Card 32 GB Class 10 Card. There is very little lag time between shots even in burst mode. The 16x wide angle Lieca lens takes much fuller photos. The Lumix gets a better background photo and much more depth. What stood out in the Canon Elphs were the vivid colors and crisp photos but so does the Lumix. The only negatives so far are with the zoom lens at distance. It seems to take longer to acquire autofocus because of the distance. So if you wanted to take a photo quick that requires long zoom, you might miss the shot because the autofocus will take a few seconds to acquire. Battery life is also comparable to the Canon.

They take great pictures most of the time (sharp, good color), are fast in time-between-shots, have a good interface, and an overall good feel when you handle them. And they can fit in my jeans pocket.However, if you are taking an HD video, and there are one or more brighter light sources in the background, then you get vertical blue stripes in the video. This is not the typical starburst video effect that you might see, but an apparent bug in their image processing software. It is purely vertical in the y axis of the saved picture, not the down direction as towards the center of the earth. And this stripe is more than a single pixel wide, and is always the same blue color. It really destroys the content of any video you take when this appears. If you had a family scene with people and it would otherwise be a great video, but there are these really pronounced stripes that just become the center of attention. A shame.And it doesn't have to be a single point of light. I got the ZS8 and ran some simple test videos. One test I did was inside my house in daylight with an open window in the background. And there was a quite wide blue bar in the video. More than a stripe. The bar that was maybe 1/3 the width of the video. This was the worst instance I've seen of it. I compared it with my existing ZS3 in the same test, and it was more pronounced in the ZS8. In my other tests the blue stripe was also more pronounced in the ZS8.

Outdoor and lit indoor pics are wonderful! As most know, There are NO point and shoot cameras that are great in low light. My old camera would hardly ever focus in low light...I have not had that happen once with the zs8. So far I have been able to take every indoor/low light pic. Now some have turned out better than others, which is expected in low light. Most have been very good by my standards. The intelligent mode is great! All I have to do is point and shoot....it decides what scene mode is best! Love it! I have played around with several of the \"scenes\" you can select in Scene Mode...High Burst mode will be great catching my son on the soccer field (note this is different then Burst), pet mode, snow mode, 2 baby modes and many, many more! I think if you have a special circumstance that intelligent mode can't handle, there is a special \"Scene Mode\" that will work (no having to try to figure out the manual settings..) Back to \"Burst\" setting...this setting take 3 pics right in a row if you hold the button down (High Burst takes multiple pics in a row). When I first got this camera, I turned on Burst. I thought...\"might as well have it turned on if I need it\".... It still took normal pics with it on (so I thought). I started to get frustrated when I was taking indoor shots... It didn't seem that the Intelligent mode would use the flash (& I thought flash was needed)... So I started to do some research in the manual.... I knew that Burst does not use flash.....what I didn't realize is that if you have the Burst setting on it turns the flash off for everything!!!! So...only turn this setting on if you are going to use it right then. If you think your pictures are dark or the flash doesn't seem to work....check if you have the Burst setting on.... :)Finally....

The problem is that you cannot clean it out without removing and taking apart the lens assembly. That is not a straightforward process if you do not have an electrical engineering degree.

The service at the Mcallen, Texas facility for Panasonic was absolutely horrible.  The people I talked to on the phone were verbally nice, but very little appropriate ACTION was taken on my requests for a price on cleaning and returning the camera to me in a timely fashion.My camera arrived for repair in Texas on August 26, 2013 and I received it back on October 21, 2013.

I went on vacation without the camera.I have bought 2 Lumix DMC-ZS8 cameras in the last 1 1/2 years.  I love the photos they take when the lenses are free of dust on the inside. However, the biggest reason why I will not buy any Panasonic camera again is twofold: 1.  service is horrible, and 2. the internal lenses on the 2 cameras I bought repeatedly collect dust inside and this spoils the photos and video I take. The dust cannot be wiped off on the inside. I went online, and on Amazaon.com and many buyers have the exact same problem with this camera.  It is a bad design in that regard.  Since my camera was out of warranty date, I did not want to pay the $200 to have the lens, sensor, etc. cleaned.  I can buy another camera for that money.  It took almost 2 months to get my camera back.  The service people never phoned or emailed me back on wither of my requests.  I always had to make the contact even though I was told someone would email me or phone me back. I offer the information for the unwary buyer.  A good company would not treat a customer like this.

Push down buttons - one direction for on and off - are much more intuitive, faster, and more touch-sensitive.  If you want to take a quick picture, this feature delays you.  I also found I took a LOT of blurry pictures on auto - this camera wasn't fast enough to take crisp focused pictures of movement.  It was bigger and heavier than my Canon, which would be OK if it did more and better, but it doesn't.  The last straw was that maybe one in 50 of my pictures just simply wouldn't show up.  I'd get a window saying there was no picture.  One in 50 isn't bad, but this never happened with the Canon.  And what if that 1 in 50 had been the best shot in the bunch?

But here goes: The color and photo clarity are stunning.  Images are sharp -- even when I crop multiple times, or crop a few times and print a 12 x 16 photo.  People often marvel at the pictures I post on FB, and sometimes even make comments about getting too close to the wildlife.  Thanks to the 16x zoom and 14 megapixels, you can generally crop to your hearts content and get great images with good detail and minimal grain.  I do most of my \"photoshopping\" in Picasa 3 (free download). Can only imagine what one could do wth a more powerful photo shop tool. Thanks to the optical image stabilizer and intelligent auto mode (you can override iA settings in manual mode if you prefer), people and moving subjects rarely come out blurry in normal light settings.  This used to be a big headache with my Canon cameras (no one could seem to stay still long enough when posing--and forget candids). In movie mode, images are quite good (even in relatively low light settings) and the sound quality is quite decent all things considered (haven't tried in a large concert venue however). All this in a small camera that easily fits into most pockets or just about any purse. The only drawbacks:  the door cover to the battery/memory card chamber is a bit flimsy and I take care to open and close it gingerly (since once that goes, it's curtains for the camera). Also, image stabilizer doesn't work so well in low light settings, and I still haven't figured out how to take concert pix without the set lights over exposing the subject.  Also, be sure to bring a charger and extra battery when traveling, since this camera uses a proprietary Lithium ion battery (as opposed to AAs).  Despite these minor drawbacks, I'm going to have to give this camer a 5 star rating and when this one goes kaput, will probably replace with another quite like it.  P.S.

I loved that ZS3. This one appears to be everything I liked about the ZS3 and some great changes. I did a ton of research before I bought the ZS3. The ZS8 is all that camera plus more. The simple things that I like: When I turn the camera on, it is ready to take a picture in 2 seconds. When I take a picture, it is ready to take the next picture in less than 4 seconds. Even at the highest quality settings. It's the same size and shape. Big enough so that it doesn't feel like a toy and the buttons aren't hard to reach. Still a little on the large size that you might not want to carry it in your pocket. But that is a small trade off for the other features. I like the relocation of the mode dial, which is now closer to the middle of the camera. And the added some more resistance to the way it turns, which means I should get way less \"mode dial is not in the correct position\" warnings. The optical zoom is now up to 16x, and the wide angle is 24mm. And I think the best move is putting the exposure button right where the instant video record button used to be. So when I want to make manual adjustments, it is right there for me. I also love the rapid zoom button. Press once it quickly zooms to max optical, press it again and you go to max digital zoom.

The look and feel are similar enough to my old camera to seem familiar which is another reason I preferred this camera.  I also like that it does not have a pop-up flash where your left finger naturally falls like Nikon and some others.While not directly related to the camera, Panasonic offers a 3 year drop/spill add-on warranty that you can purchase from their retail website for about $65.  It covers simply dropping the camera in addition to manufacturer's defects.  With something this small that you carry around, drops are very likely to happen.  The LCD display on my previous camera got cracked inside my wife's purse.  With this warranty, they repair or replace it for up to 3 years but you must purchase the warranty within 30 days of purchasing the camera.The zoom features are outstanding.  It really is amazing.

She had asked him to bring over her 35MM digital camera, zoom lens, etc., and meanwhile I had been extolling to him the virtues of traveling extra-light.  I purchased this as a gift for their travels. I hoped to find a camera that did not force one to go through screens to change settings-not my idea of a good camera design.  Interface excellent. It's intuitive, there's a revolving knob on the top a la old 35MM cameras with various settings, and it takes very clear pictures. It simultaneously displays the action on the screen, so each icon on the knob becomes foolproof to navigate. If the camera user is not one for reading instructions, it takes amazing pictures out of the box.  My son, who has expressed little interest in photography, and therefore never read the manual intended for his sister, is raving about photos he's taken on his own while she is working, and comments that great photos of (massive) buildings of interest in old cities, cathedrals, etc. are possible without having to back up like the others around him. As she would typically be taking pictures, this endorsement from my son indicates the camera is exactly what I had hoped it would be.  Point and shoot, with a wide-angle lens and large optical zoom.  People new to taking pictures will love this camera.

It also has very quick recovery time from either standard or burst shooting.  I recommend the Sandisk 16GB memory card for it.  IF you have been agonizing over 'which camera' after going through all the comments, and need to make a decision, this is a good one.

I consider my self an above average camera user with many, many years experience: Brownie Hawkeye, another Kodak (forgot the model, 35 mm Petrie 7S, 35 mm Minolta SRT 101, graduating to Pentax zoom (cannot remember the model), to Olympus digital to Canon PS, now the Panasonic ZS8.  I was somewhat skeptical because my familiarity with the Panasonic brand was with TVs, and other consumer products, not cameras. I chose this camera because of the powerful zoom, and the price.  It was the best of both worlds, in my opinion.Having introduced myself, more or less, I'll start by stating that I am not a real technical afficiando.  The end result is what I am interested in.  You can read well written technical reviews by other contributors on Amazon, and other photography publications.  I did this ad nauseum, only to end up more confused.Bottom line is that for this price, I seriously doubt you will find a better camera.  The Leica lens was definitely a selling point, I admit, as well as the 20x zoom, with 24 mm wide angle Leica lens.  Now as to using this little technological gem:  The camera has so many \"scene\" modes that it will dazzle you (and distract you) when trying them out.  It even has a \"pet\" mode, a \"baby\" mode and a \"through and airplane window\" mode that was really on the trip to/from the Emerald Isle, and an \"underwater\" mode, if you are so inclined. (Be sure to use a water proof case).There are so many combinations you can try with each scene mode using the auto setting, shutter priority, aperature priority, etc.  I used the auto mode primarily with and without flash.  Definitely buy an extra battery (charger and battery come with the camera), and at least a 8 gb memory, class 10, and a screen protector for the 3\" LCD viewer.I did use the video mode for short clips of birthdays, etc. but this was not my primary use of the camera.I was so impressed with this camera that I purchased a Panasonic Lumix ZS19 from Costco last month during the Black Friday sale. I used it for a few days, and thanks to Costco's liberal return policy, it went back to the warehouse.  The ZS19 just did not measure up to the ZS8, in spite of the longer zoom, and touch screen LCD.  The ZS19 had fewer \"scene\" modes, and did not come with an external battery charger.I am thoroughly satisfied with this camera, and am sure you will be also, if you decide to buy it.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "poor focus, color and sharpness", "Author": "megan vellema", "ReviewID": "R1B4DVZHQ61W3Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will not be recording my memories with this camera- dissatisfed and looking for something else.

Given the amount of use this has had in about a year and a half, this camera has held up really well but I wanted to reiterate other's reviews about the dust under the lense.  I started having this problem about 5 months ago and it seems like from these other reviews, it is a camera defect and it will happen eventually to everyone who uses this camera unless retiring it after a few months.  That being said, the dust only seems to show on my pictures sometimes when I zoom.  It shows on the screen before I take a picture so I will usually just zoom it in or out 1 or 2x until it goes away.  It is a little bit of a nuisance but given the large zoom this camera has it hasn't been a major issue.

It's small enough to fit in your back pocket, there are tons of different settings that can be used, HD video, the quality of my pictures and videos are fantastic, sound distortion in the videos very rarely occurs, colors are vibrant, and zoom for both picture and video is out of this world. I'm also really impressed with the battery life.. If my battery is fully charged before I go to a concert, it still has quite a bit of juice left even after taking a good amount of pictures and video. Not only have I used it at concerts, but I've used it a few times for taking pictures outdoors. Once again, fantastic quality pictures. Not only is it great at all the things listed above, but it's also super easy to use.

So far I found everything I liked from the precious version plus a few more useless stuff and a more durable battery.The good point is that its autonomy is VERY long. In Yellowstone National Park, I probably took a good 700-800 pictures before it died off, which is remarkable (also, the batteries from the previous model are compatible). It's also very easy to use and quite faster than the previous generation. It does quite a good job both as a point and shoot and as a SLR-like with its manual mode, like extended expositions and a tripod (I took some awesome pictures of lightning bolts very easily with it).On the other side, I also see a few small things I don't like about this model. First, the iA mode (fully automatic) is often really off balance, and by that I mean that it doesn't convey something that looks natural. Often, everything is too bright or too dark and the colors are either de-saturated of too contrasted. Either way, it's not very handy to use because you often have to try multiple shots at different variations of contrast to get the best picture or aim for the sky and lower your aim while maintaining the focus to get more crisp colors. It still does a decent job, but I kinda prefer to use it in full manual mode to get what I need.Second, pictures are more often blurry or poorly sharpened using this model than the previous one. I often get some bad artefacts and post-processing glitches... nothing that can't be eased out by resizing the picture down and sharpening it a bit, but it still bothers me a bit.Finally, what REALLY bothers me about this camera is the same as with its predecessor: the lenses/objective/zoom is NOT SEALED or AIR TIGHT at all! Which means that dust can and will easily collect inside the lenses and make all your future pictures bad. After one week of extensive (more than 5000 pictures) but careful use (putting it back in its little bag after every use) in a dusty environment (desert of Arizona and Utah), dust had already collected in the lenses. This is very unfortunate and can happen after one single mistake. Mine was to let it turned on a few minutes while hiking (which means with the lenses exposed). I usually ALWAYS and CONSTANTLY turn it off after I take a picture to avoid this situation, but I forgot once and got bitten immediately.So yes, all in all a very good camera, but it had its flaws, as minor as they might be.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "best camera for your money", "Author": "David Jenison \"davidjenison\"", "ReviewID": "R3RPPGEEJ4PM5T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love the Lumix with the leica lens.

Honestly for me I really just use auto but my girlfriend is a photographer so using auto is not an option. I love the fact that I can hold the shutter button and it shows what the image will look like. Its pretty fast too. Also remember speed also comes from how fast your memory card is. If you have a slow memory card, the camera will be slow too. Another plus is that it can use a 64 gig memory card. You may ask why in the world would you need that big of a memory card... Well I went to Niagara Falls with this camera and if I didn't have a computer I would have had one day of pictures... So if you don't have access to a computer than you want the most storage as possible. And while I'm on the topic of Niagara Falls... This camera got wet from the falls. And I'm not talking about dunked in water or one drop. It got pretty wet. I was worried the water would get into the lenses but it didn't. Everything still works. I wouldn't recommend doing that too much but the great pictures I got were totally worth risking the camera. (SD cards wont be affected by water as long as they are not being read or written to when it gets wet, some SD cards are even waterproof)Depending on where you buy it this camera can be an amazing deal. I got it at Sam's club and it came with a 4 gig sd card. For free that's not too bad. And Sam's club has better customer service so all the issues you people are having with returns...

(To my very deep sorrow, I must add, because I LOVED that camera!) I expected this to be a step up. Technically speaking it may be, but functionally it is a huge disappointment. I find the logic utterly confounding, so it takes me forever to find the correct setting for a given situation; and too often, by the time I figure that out, the opportunity is gone.But the worst offense is that the leaves on the lens cover malfunction constantly and unpredictably, opening fully as they should, or as just a hockey-stick-shaped slit, or not at all.  In total frustration, today I put a tiny dab of LockEase (colloidal graphite) on my finger, carefully rubbed it onto the leaves. I then activated the lens several times  - shaking the camera when necessary -to carry the graphite to the moving parts of the leaves. I can't be sure just yet that it's a fix, but the last dozen times I tried it, the cover opened fluidly and completely.My previous cameras (prior to the Kodak V610) were Olympus models, which I would have rated 4 and 5 stars. IF the lens cover problem is actually resolved (fingers crossed), the best I can say for this Lumix camera is that it's okay.

I will say you aren't going to get absolutely incredible professional pictures with this camera of course but the lens and zoom were surprisingly good for dirt cheap and I took 1600+ pictures in Ireland that I can be completely content with for the rest of my life. The Lumix DMC - ZS8 was easy to use and has 25 or so automatic, easy-to-navigate settings that I used a lot to switch when I was in sunset, indoor, beach, and portrait situations.  They worked solid although you would probably be better served creating your own settings for certain situations so your pics will be more focussed towards your tastes. But it is still nice to have all these preprogrammed settings. The camera can be tweaked a lot also for users with more experience. What really surprised me was the video. There were a few situations I idn't have the Handycam with me and took video and was shocked how good it was. Very good color and clarity you can see here: [...] Like most cheaper cameras it does a lot better in good light and outdoors but I'd give it a C+ indoors. For what I needed it to do on a 12 day vacation it was like my right hand for the entire trip. It is also a great looking camera also and has a solid, well built casing.

I know the bigger cameras take great pictures but didn't want to be burdened with hauling one around.  The reviews for the Lumix camera portrayed it to be just what I was looking for. I was not disappointed.  These are the features I really like about it: It turns on and is ready to take a photo incredibly fast. Sometimes you just can't wait around for your camera to power up. The 16X zoom is what initially got me interested in this camera. It quickly zooms out to cover those distant shots that you want to enlarge.  Because of the wide angle lens you don't have to back way up to get an entire building or scene in the photo. I really like the \"scene\" mode feature that allows for different light settings. There were several places in Europe where the lighting was dim but I didn't want a flash picture. It produced beautiful results.  There was even a middle of the night photo of the moon, stars and a few city lights that turned out wonderfully. I have received several compliments on my photos wondering what kind of camera took such great shots. There is also a picture \"burst\" feature that takes several shots very quickly to capture just that \"right\" moment. It worked very well when a German friend was demonstrating shooting his muzzleloader rifle. I wanted to have a photo of the moment the smoke and fire shot out the barrel.  With the 8 pictures I had taken in the space of about a second I was able to get just the perfect shot and delete the rest.  The Lumix DMC-ZS8 is an easy to use camera that takes great pictures. One added observation is I noticed a great number of people in Europe, from many countries, taking photos with the exact same model camera.

I have 5 older children, and would like to also record the moments we have together, as rare as they have become these days.  I've only played with the camera for a few hours, but am already thrilled with it.  I can really point and shoot, very easily, on the automatic setting.  The photos are so clear and colorful.  It is so much more vivid than the 3 year old digital camera I have.  I took a close-up photo of a very colorful Christmas decoration and was pleasantly surprised at all the detail.  I even found a tag on it that i had overlooked! I would recommend this camera for those who are like me, just casually taking photos, but desiring to share them with others in good conscience.  I want my photos to be good enough to send on to friends and family, and now I'm sure I'll be able to do that. The other reviewers did talk about more in depth abilities of the camera.  I hope to be able to explore those capacities, too, over time.Thank you, previous reviewers, for your help with choosing this camera. I am very happy with my choice!Update: I've had my camera for 2 weeks now. I can't believe the photos it takes. They are all so clear and colorful.  I am now impressed with the battery life, seeing that I've had it in and out of my purse for the last 2 weeks, taking photos, and playing with settings. The battery is just now losing a bit of charge.  Today I was able to take long distance photos of ducks on a lake, and it actually looks like ducks!  I caught some of them flying away, and some still on the surface of the lake. Before, I could only see black dots on the water, and my cameras couldn't focus on a moving subject.

The zoom is pretty good, no doubt, but we still frequently get blurry images, even when not using zoom.  Also, it does not take close-up pictures very well (like if you want to take pictures of a plant), and it does not handle low-light conditions very well.However, what pushed me over the edge is that getting a second battery for it is turning out to be nightmareish.  You see comments and reviews that Panasonic has gone to some length to prevent you from buying a generic battery, but I can't actually find a genuine replacement battery for it, not even from Panasonic themselves.  So my only choice seems to be to try and buy a generic and hope that it works for me (some say it does and some say it doesn't).To sum up: I deeply regret buying this product for two reasons:  1.

I love Amazon, they often ship to Alaska for free which others rarely do, but I can't understand why the price keeps changing around.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Big disappointment all around.", "Author": "Marilyn Armstrong", "ReviewID": "R2H907QKC4S3LN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After USPS lost the first one of these I ordered, I finally got it. Maybe it was the poor excuse for packing (rattling around in a bigger box without so much as a piece of bubble pack) or maybe it's just a bad copy of an otherwise good camera.

I actually couldn't find any redeeming features and I returned it. Was it my particular unit or the design? I don't know and past a certain point, I don't care. Maybe it's a quality control issue.

This was my 3rd digital camera, I had a Sony purchased in 2007 (Sony Cybershot DSCW55 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver) and a Nikon purchased in 2010 (Nikon Coolpix S8000 14.2 MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3.0-Inch)both were damaged due to my children throwing them in the pool.My first impression was that it was not easy to use and pictures did not come out as clear as my other 2 cameras. I had to take several shots and adjust so the picture could come out good. After 2 days of using the camera, there was a error message (zoom error) that did not allow me to use the camera, I removed the battery closed it several times. Did not want to take a chance, when I returned from vacation I had to return it and will most likely  go with a NIKON, need to do the research before I decide on the model.

However charging it is not easy.  Most things you just attach the charger plug to the camera, and the other end to the electrical outlet, or to a computer.  This one does not charge when you connect it to the computer.  It does not charge when you connect it to an outlet.  You MUST OPEN UP THE CAMERA AND REMOVE THE BATTERY, every time you need to charge the battery!  Then you MUST place the battery into a little compartment/charger and plug that into the electrical outlet.  Then when the battery is charged you take it out of the little compartment and open up the camera again, put the battery into the camera, close and lock the cover.  What a pain.  And if you are out and about you must make sure you brought that little compartment to charge the battery, you can't just bring the plug and plug in the camera to the computer or to the wall.  You must always take out the battery completely.  I don't like it at all.  The pictures on the Sony Cyber Shot are better, clearer, more detailed, but that one never held a charge for more than 12 photos!  So it went back to Amazon and I bought the Panasonic Lumix.  Since I'm tired of calling, requesting, sending back, doing without a camera while waiting for them to mail it, I will keep this one.
