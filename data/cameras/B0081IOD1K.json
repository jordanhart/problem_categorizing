{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good little camera", "Author": "Taj", "ReviewID": "R23XMP29HE6BP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was a common model at Wal-Mart until recently. I picked mine up for $99 on a Valentine's special. I read the walmart.com reviews and felt I should add some points to the other points made by owners.1. This camera is not bad like some people will say in the reviews. Some people gripe the picture quality is like a cell phone camera. I would say if this camera is taking pictures that bad, then it is a case of USER failure, not CAMERA failure. If you can't be bothered to read the instructions, you really shouldn't review it. Most of my pictures have turned out great with just a few easy adjustments that were covered in the manual.2. Sample pictures. Walmart.com has some really crappy sample pictures that are either non-corrected night shots that a person failed to adjust in the camera settings, or shots that the person CLEARLY did not use the focus feature by pressing the shutter button halfway. If you just go click click click, this is not a camera for you.3. Zoom complaints. The zoom on this camera is really powerful and clear. I have had no issues with it, but I will say that you do have to hold STEADY. If you cannot hold yourself still and just slam your finger down on the shutter button (jarring the camera) your pictures will turn out like crap. Use a tripod. Unless you are shaking the camera violently, normal pictures all turn out fine. Zoomed pictures take a little more practice, but I was able to take a clear shot riding as a passenger in a car of a billboard 75 feet away at least. Again, most complaints are just USER failure, not CAMERA failure.4. Color reproduction. When properly adjusted so that the light levels are even, I would say the color reproduction is approximately as good as a similarly priced Canon and better than the entry level Nikon cameras.5. Video leaves a bit to be desired, but is still good quality. Zoom is limited in video mode, so have it prepared beforehand. Motor noise can be heard in the videos, but it is vastly quieter than the last generation of Fuji cameras.Overall I'd rate the camera great at moderate ISO levels, excellent at outdoors shots, above average at indoors shots, and above average at video. Battery life is quite nice, and with four rechargeable AA batteries it lasts a long time. Make sure to use a high speed memory card or HD video will be a miserable experience for you with constant buffering. All and all a good buy.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera for the price!", "Author": "ivinest", "ReviewID": "R3ANRPGMU0IITT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before buying this camera I read all the reviews carefully.  Overall the reviews were positive so for $129 which included an eight gigabite, high speed memory card, I thought it a good deal.  I was rewarded with more than I ever expected.  The camera is fantastic and performs better than some of thethe more expensive cameras I've owned in the past.  You have to be a real dunce to take bad pictures with this camera, and now I know the negative reviews I read were because the users simply did not take the time to read the instructions. For the money, you will not find the features nor the quality photos this camera is capable of.  And, the video is not bad, either.  Buy it!", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Janine G", "ReviewID": "R3OLLY7T9OQP6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to buying this camera all I had ever owned in the way of digital camera's were second hand ones I purchased at a yard sale. It was a shot that should have been great but was not (because of the very old/bad camera) that finally spurred me into seeking out a good camera. I read reviews and decided on this one. I have been very satisfied with the camera and it made me really love taking pictures which in turn started me down the road to getting an even better camera-but that's another story.This camera is pretty easy to use and it has a fair amount of manual settings. Some people call these type of point and shoot cameras a \"bridge camera\" because it is a step up from the simple digital cameras but not quite a dslr. I personally always think of it as a \"gateway camera\" as in gateway drug because it awakened the sleeping photography addict within! You can get as involved in the process as you want; or not since it also has an automatic setting which figures it all out for you, and a scene selection setting in which you choose what type of picture you want to take- portrait, landscape, flower etc.The zoom is fantastic and if you have steady hands your pictures will turn out crisp. I was thanking my good fortune this past spring when my son graduated high school in a rather large venue. We were seated very far away and I was still able to get some very good shots. The ones that were not good were my fault- shaky hands!The picture quality and color are also wonderful. About the time I got this camera I also got some photo editing software. One thing I have noted about this camera was that the color balance rarely needed adustment- it was usually dead on.So, if you want to take beautiful crisp pictures with true colors and you are not ready to take that leap into the world of dslr-this is the camera for you", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first camera", "Author": "santiago", "ReviewID": "R3IM93GEVRBD3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm really happy with this camera.

This is not the camera's issue it was mine. I learned to adjust the settings and the next time I attended a concert and the artist was even farther away, the pictures turned out really great! I owned a Fuji S3200 which was by far a better camera and unfortunately it was stolen. The comparison is not fair. The optical zoom on the S2940 is good, but I miss the digital zoom feature of my old camera. For the money though, this is an outstanding camera and reading the manual is imperative to take awesome pictures. Video turned out good too.

My wife liked it so much she wanted one too. So I bought a refurbished camera from AmazingDeals coincidentally for the same price. When I received the package (supposedly as packed by Fujifilm) the box did not include the manual (which can be downloaded from the Fujifilm website) or the batteries (understandable since the batteries would have been used by the customer who returned it) or the lens cap - that is totally not understandable. AmazingDeals claims that Fujifilm does not include the lens cap on refurbished cameras; frankly I do not believe this. I have bought many refurbished products and never had missing items.
