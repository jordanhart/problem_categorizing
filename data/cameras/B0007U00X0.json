After seeing the Sigma 10-20mm, taking test shots with it and the Nikon, and then printing the shots in the store, I walked out with the Sigma lens.I had planned to buy the 12-24mm Nikon next Spring when my budget would allow the expenditure.  I have had success with Nikon optics in the past - starting with my first Nikon FM back in the seventies.  The Sigma's good construction, nice finish, smooth+fast+quiet focusing and 10mm focal length convinced me to try my first non-Nikon lens in 30 years. A big factor: The Sigma lens is less than half the price of the Nikon lens here is Canada.  It fit my budget, so I took the plunge.The Sigma fits into my \"sharp enough\"  category.  In real world shooting, its sharpness is on par with my 18-200mm Nikon. Both lens are less sharp than my $100 50mm 1.8 when \"test\" images are blown up to 16\"x20\" size. I never notice any lack of sharpness in  \"real\" pictures.  I care more about color saturation, contrast and color balance anyway.  In this area, the Sigma does well.  Saturation and contrast are equal to both my other Nikon lens - particularly at f8 and smaller aperatures.  Wide open, I find some weakening in contrast.  The Sigma has a warmer color termperature than my other lens.  One click toward blue in Photoshop would fix this minor variance in color.  But I use my 10-20mm almost exclusively for landscapes.  The warmer color is generally a good thing.I have noticed some vignetting @ 10mm f4.  Zooming to 12mm or stopping down to f5.6 elminates any artifacts in pictures I have taken thus far.  I have found it's more important to avoid \"thick framed\" filters - and stacking filters is a no no with this lens.  They cause more darkening than a wide open f-stop.  BTW: I added a 72 to 77mm step-up ring to my 18-200m VR Nikon to allow me to share filters between my zoom lens.I do miss having a manual/autofocus switch on the Sigma lens.  I have accidently nudged the manual focus ring a couple of times.  With that said, the incredible depth of field of this lens (or any lens at this focal length) means small focusing errors can be tolerated :) I recommend this lens - even to people like me, who never had a non-nikon lens before.", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Could be 1 Star, Could be 5 Stars!

Here is why:When I received my lens I later realized that I did not receive the extended three year warranty card that comes with the USA versions of the lens. Instead of just sending me the extended warranty card Amazon shipped me a whole new lens. Now while I was reading reviews prior to ordering this lens I had seen many reviews where the reviewer either loved this lens or they hated it. After a while I could see why...Some of the lenses that are being shipped are sharp all the way around while some are not sharp at all. Many claimed it was sharper at F:8 than F:4 while others said theirs was never sharp at all. Some complained about distortion and or dull or over saturated colors. I finally found a reviewer who had the opportunity to try 3-4 different lenses. They found that there seemed to be a lack of quality control all around when it came to this specific lens. Having a few days of both lenses I decided to compare them out for myself. I am glad I did.I put my camera in the front yard on a tripod and shot numerous sets of three for each lens at 10mm, 14mm, and 20mm. The results were surprising. The original lens I had been sent first was a clear winner. The trees and anything else around the picture were sharp, The replacement lens was anything but sharp. The colors on lens two were more vibrant than lens one but one can fix that with software where a blurred image is not really fixable.I shot numerous sets with both lenses and a few different F settings and the results remained the same. The replacement lens was the one being returned. Lucky for me the Sigma extended warranty cards have nothing on them, you enter the serial numbers yourself so I kept the card and returned the replacement lens.I have included two photos to the gallery for this lens so you can see what I found. In the end my first lens would have received a 5 star rating because they really are excellent lenses if you can get a good copy. The replacement copy would have received a 1 star rating. Luckily I had the chance to compare the two copies side by side or I may have never known just how bad lens number two really was.If your lens has problems like lens number two you have a poor copy of the lens, return it. Sadly from all of the reviews I have read it seems that maybe 20% of the lenses are not good copies. Many just think poor sharpness is just a general lens limitation when chances are it is just a poor copy they received.Bottom line!1. Get the lens out and shoot some shots, If it is not sharp around the edges return it for another copy.2. If you do not get your extended warranty card you may have gotten a gray market lens. Return it.Upon talking to a Sigma rep I was told they have no way to verify whether the lens is USA or Gray market (international) by the serial number, if you do not have the extended warranty card you will not get the warranty extension so buyer beware. The card is a card stock type black and red folded warranty card that specifically states that it is the extended warranty card. Don't let any dealer tell you that it has the extended warranty without it being in your hands. Sigma currently has no registration on their website. The rep told me to keep the card in a safe place and then in the event that I need service I will send it and a copy of the original sales receipt in with the lens for service.All that being said I can tell you that this is a wonderful lens if you need a super wide angle lens and you get a good copy. They are not the fastest lenses around but for the money you cannot beat it.Take a look at the pictures I included for the lens and hopefully they will help you determine if you were lucky on the Sigma draw and give you an idea of what you need to check for.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "best value wide angle.", "Author": "K.

I was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens; and it's rectilinear, which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph. It is a well-made lens, made with high-grade materials. What this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes, close-quarters interior photography, and in architectural photography where you don't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces (and is typical of wide-angle lenses). You can also get close to the subject as well: 5 inches from subject to the front surface of the lens. By the way, if you're going to photograph in Big Sky Country, this is the one lens you can't leave home without.

Pickering", "ReviewID": "R1A1CRU7295DHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted an ultra wide angle lens for my new Canon EOS 40D, but I didn't have the money to purchase a high cost Canon ultra wide lens.  Careful research kept pointing to the Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DS HSM lens.  At 4 to 5.6, this lens is slightly dark, but for an outdoor lens I figured lighting wouldn't be much of an issue.  With a range of 10 to 20mm I decided this lens would offer very wide shots and near fish-eye creativity capabilities.I always buy only Canon lenses, but I don't buy the professional level models.  After all, I am a photo hobbyist, not a professional photographer.  Well even though I really wanted to purchase a quality ultra-wide angle lens, I was low on funds due to recently over spending on Christmas gifts for my friends and family.  Although I wanted to buy a Canon ultra-wide, I just didn't have that kind of cash.  I read several rave reviews on this Sigma 10-20mm lens so I ordered one up.  I haven't had it very long but I have taken several photos with this lens and so far I am quite impressed.  At 10mm you do get some curved distortions, giving a bit of a fisheye effect.  This can be good or bad, depending on what you are looking for in your shot.  As another reviewer pointed out, this effect can make clouds look wonderful.  This is an EX series Sigma, with a super fast HSM auto focus.  The focusing is quick and accurate.  The filter size is 77mm, which is HUGE, and filters can be quite expensive, but for what you save on the cost of the lens you can afford to invest in quality UV and polarizer filters.  This lens is also fairly light weight and very classy looking.  The shiny gold ring is a nice touch indeed.  I also really love the fact that this lens comes with a lens hood and a nice padded case.I only have a couple of minor complaints, neither of which would cause me to reduce my rating.  First and most distracting is the fact that the focus and zoom rings are reversed, compaired to the Canon lenses, so I find myself constantly adjusting focus when I mean to adjust zoom.  This is something that I will get used to and certainly does not affect the overall quality of the lens.  Secondly, with the lens stored in its squarish, padded case, it makes the whole package a bit large and I cannot fit it in my camera bag.So, with all of this being said I have to give this Sigma EX series 10-20mm lens a solid 5 stars.  The optics produce quality photographs, the overall feel of the lens is perfect, and the price is substantially less than the closest Canon equivalent.  5 stars may seem a bit high to some people, who feel that only the most perfect, professional lenses deserve this high of a score.  But I feel that the quality and performance of this lens merrits a perfect score.  For the average consumer photographer there just isn't a better ultra-wide lens on the market today.  It even scores better than the Canon ultra-wides!  I couldn't be happier with my new Sigma EX 10-20mm, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent ultra-wide lens.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "EPIC LENS", "Author": "Damien R", "ReviewID": "R3E0Z88QWV1YSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before purchasing this lens, I looked at the Nikon 12-24 and the tokina 12-24.  Both were more expensive, and claimed to be be excellent performers.  After comparing all three, the Sigma 10-20 was the hands down winner in my book for a number of reasons.1. Packaging - Came in a very attractive box with a manual and included not only a lens hood, but a very nice lens case!  Good Job Sigma!2. Build - The lens feels tough and has a very attractive finish to it.  The focus ring is nicely dampened and is very easy to modulate.  My only gripe is that the lens cap is useless, get a nikon lens cap and youre all set.3. Performance - The sigma is 2mm wider than its nikon and tokina counterparts and boy does it make a difference.  The FOV is wide on my D50 and i can capture so much on one single shot that when people see them, their first words are \"how the hell...\".  Distortion at the wide end is there, but is easily controllable through precise leveling or from post processing.  You might see some vignetting at 10mm but just stop it down and you should be all set (or you can correct it with a click of the mouse in photoshop).  I have heard complaints about sigma not having a constant aperture.  In my opinion, who the hell needs it.  When I am taking shots in the day, the natural light is sufficient enough.  For night shots, i use a tripod and usually stop it down to F8-f10 where the sigma's optical performance is at its best.  This is an amazing piece of glass and I encourage those looking for a wide angle lens to definintely take the sigma into consideration.  Looking at Sigma's future lens lineup, I don't consider them to be a 'third party' lens company anymore.

Even with the accompanied pincushion distorsion (see below) the 10mm focal length is simply a joy (Nikon's zoom only goes as wide as 12mm, 12 is noticable narrower than 10).(+) Optical quality - is very good as far as I can judge. There is a pretty noticeable pincushion distorion at the 10mm end, but I understand all ultra-wide zooms suffer from the same phenomena. The distorsion at 12mm focal length is far less noticable.(+) Build quality - no complaints. except for this lens I also own Sigma's 30mm f/1.4 lens (which has disappointing optical performance IMO). 30mm's optical issues aside, - both feel solid and stable, no loose rings or levers or anything like that. Sigma does an excellent job here.(+) HSM focusing works very well, my guess is that Nikon would be as good or perhaps slightly better. One of the other non-Nikon alternative uses the screwdriver blade type auto focus rather than ultrasonic motor (the built it ultrasonic AF is way nicer to use).All the negatives or 'cons' if you will, are right there in the data sheet, no unpleasent surprises whatsoever. The lens is big and heavy but so is the competition (Nikon). I wish it could go a little further to say 22mm or 25mm, but again - I knew it won't, before I bought it.

I don't mean to get technical, but for those who do not know the sticky details, modern Digital SLRs often have sensors that are quite a bit smaller than the traditional exposure area of film: 24mmx36mm. In the case of Nikon DSLRs (all current models except their $5000 Nikon D3 12.1MP FX Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) professional FX sensor model) use what they call a DX sensor which is 16mmx24mm.For us old film hounds, this means that a lens of a given focal length will roughly translate to 1.5x when switching from film (of Full frame) to DX. So, your old 20mm wide angle lens will \"crop\" to about the equivalent of a 35mm lens when put on a DX sensor DSLR.For those who really like telephoto shots, this is a positive boon. Your 300mm lens will take pictures that have the same angle of view as a 450mm lens, but for those of us wide-angle freaks, this \"digital crop factor\" takes some of the \"punch\" out of the bottom end. Many general-use zooms for the DX sensor cameras start around 18mm. This would be ultra-wide on that old film camera, but it takes pictured that look more like what you'd expect from a 28mm lens on a traditional film camera.Ok, sorry for all the mumbo jumbo, but now on to why this lens is so great...With its 10mm-20mm focal length, this lens is the 35mm film SLR equivalent of a 15mm to 35mm zoom lens, and 15mm full-frame is about the widest you can go before getting into \"fish-eye\" territory.With this Sigma lens at 10mm, you get a very wide angle perspective without crossing over into fish-eye territory. Yes, there is noticeable \"barreling\", but nothing beyond the range of most modern photo/image editing software's ability to fix. Frankly, I like a little of that in my ultra-wide photos. At the 20mm end, the \"barreling\" is much less noticeable.As will all extreme wide angle lenses, if you get right on top of your subject, you'll really amplify the distortion effect, but if you're shooting at 10mm and focusing down to the lenses minimum focus distance (an amazing 10\" or so), you're probably already expecting, and even counting on such distortion anyway.Did I mention that it focuses down to around 10\"?The construction of this lens is solid, and it has a little heft to it. It comes with its own custom lens hood. USE IT. The front element on this lens bulges out a bit (as you can see from the product photos), and aside from helping with lens flare, that extra bit of \"guard rail\" will help you avoid scratching the thing. I've put a UV filter on the front to help protect the glass, but the distance between that glass and the front lens element makes this \"reflection box\" that has visibly shown in some of my highly backlit/highly contrasty photos.The focusing is fast and silent. I really like the fact that this is one of those \"internally focusing\" lenses which means that the act of focusing does not turn the manual focus rung, and doesn't make the lens change position or size. More importantly, if you want to manually focus, you can just grab the ring and turn because it's not \"locked\" into place in AF mode like many other lenses.I've taken some of my best photos with this lens, and for the wide-angle enthusiast with a DX sensor Nikon DSLR, I'd go so far as to say this is a must-have. It's got 2mm wider focal length than the nearest Nikon (with DOES make a visible difference at the low-end), but its incredibly well made and clear from edge to edge (though, it does have that \"barrel\" distortion... it's still crisp from end to end with little to no vignetting)Sorry, I probably went on a bit, but as you can tell, I really like this lens. I'd highly recommend that you do your research before you buy it as ultra-wide angles do have some idiosyncrasies, but if you know what to expect (photographically) from them, then this lens is one of the best I've ever played with/owned.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "WIDE!", "Author": "Daniel Marley", "ReviewID": "R2NOFL0X80SNSY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "10mm for the Sigma versus 12mm for the Nikon, and it costs around half as much.

Shots were of an old picket fence and a fruit basket, at 16 and 20mm with f-stops at wide open, f8 and f22. Auto focus center-weighted. Distance 1 meter. During this test, I realized that the Sony was auto-focusing to one meter, while the Sigmas read just over a meter.  I double checked my distance and then manually focused the Sigmas to 1m. Pics were great. When allowed to auto-focus, the Sigmas consistently read just past 1m. Reviewing my earlier shots which seemed soft revealed this back-focusing was the true culprit.Lastly, I compared the Sony 16-105 to my Sigma 50mm 2.8 EX macro using the same process described above. The Sigma 50mm auto-focused perfectly and is easily the most detailed lens I have. I've also used other Sony lenses, as well as a Minolta 200mm 2.8, with no auto-focus issues.

Two months later, I couldn't be happier. It shoots where no other lens could shoot. Everyone knows that \"10mm is wide\", but few realize just how wide it is until they see it. Our eyes see in the 40-50mm range, so we're not used to perceiving such a wide field. When you look through this lens, you see pictures that you didn't even know were there.The glass quality is excellent, obviously not up to Canon L standards, but that was never the purpose. The pictures are SHARP and clear, and colors are excellent (tints tend slightly toward the warmer end when compared to Canon's 10-22mm; I like that, personally, but YMMV).Subjects are obviously deformed when shot up close at 10mm, but know what you're doing and that becomes a great tool for artistic pictures! You can shoot a 5'5\" person head to toes from less than 3 feet away. Also, I am happy to report that at 20mm there is NO distortion whatever, regardless of the subject's distance.The only problem I can see right now with this lens is a rainbow effect when shooting at 10mm in direct sunlight. The hood helps some, but you'll still get the rainbow in some pictures. See my pic in the customer image section.

If you are going to go wide, go as wide as you can and get this lens.Combined with the zoomed end, it is a very versatile instrument and will likely see more time attached to my camera than the 18-135 kit lens.Contrary to rumors commonly circulating on the internet which made me think twice about getting this lens, upon some use I have found these rumors unfounded and have encountered no problems.  Here are my findings to debuke the rumors you will see around:The lens caps are just fine, the front one being identical to a Nikon design and well made, the rear one snugly fitting, (maybe a bit too tight).  Don't waste your money on replacement lens caps as others have claimed to have done until you have seen these.Contrary to many people's worries, the addition of a single 77mm Tiffen clear UV filter as sold by Amazon creates NO vignetting.  According to the lens instructions you should not add a second filter, as THIS may cause vignetting.  Personally I do not stack filters anyway.  Don't believe the vignetting hype, it 'aint there.Contruction is robust and the lens feels like a tank.  The controls operate smoothly, with confidence and precision.  There is no creep.The packaging is fine.  The enclosed carrying case is well made to a rectangular shape and has interior padding.  Unlike the sueded bags that come with a Nikon lens, Sigma put a lot of attention into making a protective case worthy of this lens.

Mount the Sigma (or any other ultrawide) on a DSLR, rack it out to 10-11mm, look through the viewfinder and see an entirely new perspective on the world that is totally different from what the human eye sees. Objects that are close to the camera appear much closer, and distant objects appear to be much farther away. You'll also notice that straight lines toward the edges of the frame bend, and this distortion changes dramatically as you point the camera up or down. It's a whole new world of photography, and making effective use of the ultrawide perspective takes some practice and getting used to.Regarding the Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 specifically, it is arguably the most popular among several ultrawide choices available to Nikon and Canon users for several good reasons -- not the least of which is its low price (I recently purchased one from Amazon for my Nikon D90 for $479.99). Construction quality is excellent, particularly for a third party lens. There's nothing loose or sloppy about it, and it feels solid. I especially like the nonslip exterior finish of the zoom and focus rings, which are large and well-separated. Zooming is a little on the stiff side, but very nicely dampened and smooth without any \"catches\" in the zoom travel.Optically it's a bit of a compromise, like all ultrawides, but Sigma did a good job of balancing them. Overall sharpness is generally quite good, but it's not absolutely tack-sharp. It's noticeably soft, even in the center, at f/4 (especially zoomed out to 10mm). Stopping down to f/5.6 cures this and improves edge sharpness dramatically. Vignetting is also quite noticeable wide open at 10mm, but stopping down a bit virtually eliminates this problem. Distortion at 10 mm is irregular and difficult to correct in post processing, but simply zooming in to 11mm corrects this problem for architectural shots with a lot of straight lines. Lens flare and chromatic aberration that can be problematic with ultrawides are both extremely well managed -- not a problem at all, in fact.In summary, the Sigma 10-20 is a reasonably priced and incredibly useful addition that will open up new photographic horizons for anyone whose current widest angle lens is 17-18mm. For example, it's a perfect complement to the versatile Nikon 18-200 VR lens for anyone who wants to travel light and still have all their bases covered for any photographic eventuality.

When it comes to ultra-wides, I've had my share. From the Tokina 11-16/2.8 (sold cause the range was too limited), two copies (one Nikon, one Canon) of the Tokina 12-24/4 and the Tokina 10-17 fisheye, I've tried most of them out there. (Sorry, I'll not spend a dime on a EF-S lens again. Thus, I've never had the cheapo Canon 10-22)This is my replacement to the motorless Nikon-mount Tokina 12-24/4 (version 1 - version 2 has an internal focus motor). I was very skeptical of this lens for a number of reasons. Sigma has had troubles lately, I'm not a fan of variable aperture lenses and it's a \"third party\" lens. I've owned lots of them, but I usually end up being happier with Canon or Nikon lenses. As this does replace one of the top-rated (and personal fav of mine) 12-24, it has a lot to live up to. It doesn't disappoint.Honestly, you're spending about half (or less) than any Nikon branded lens in the range (and right now - that would be one: 10-24). So expecting perfection or even close is certainly a path to unhappiness. I expected to send it back - but I haven't.Pros: 10mm on the short end. Fixable distortion. Reasonable CA. You get good colors and contrast. Fast focus, given the focal length.Cons: CA, soft at the edges.Really, for the money and for the way that most of us print, you'll find little, if any, difference between this and any other UWA. Nope, it doesn't have a fixed 2.8 - so if isolating your subject is important - pick the Tokina 11-16. Although I'm not sure that's the focus of this type of lens, anyway.Anyone who will be really unhappy with this lens will fall into two camps: pixel-peepers and pros. Pros, most likely, won't be shooting DX anyway. Pixel-peepers are seldom, if ever, really happy. Everyone else is going to find what most reviewers say, it's a great lens.

I know what I like and know quality when I have my hands on it.  An ultra-wide is not a lens that folks normally use a lot.  But, when you need one there's nothing like 10-20mm.  It was a tossup between the Sigma 10-20mm and the Canon 10-22mm lens. I chose the Sigma because of the price and some other great reviews.Quality of the Sigma, in many unbiased test reviews, shows little, if any, differences from the higher priced canon.  On both my XTI and 40d the lens does a great job.  My recommendation?  Buy it. Since I've had mine I was convinced to buy another Sigma lens.  The pictures are very sharp.

Surprisingly, I still can rotate the lens in the mount (in locked position) to a small but noticeable degree. It seems that the lock mechanism on this lens has \"extended\" tolerance and/or the mount coupling lens-body is not tight enough. This is a bit annoying. The zoom barrel is stiff in operation, so it happens to me to push it a bit harder and so turn the lens in the mount.Now a few words about the optical quality of this lens.I read many reports stating that their copy of the lens was good, as well as the ones stating the opposite.Although my copy of this lens is not as sharp as my prime lenses (which was expected), it is good. But there is one \"BUT\".My lens is sharp provided it is focused correctly. This is something difficult to achieve in certain situations and especially at wider angles. With this lens the AF tends to lock elsewhere, but not on the subject. And often there is no consistency - even if I focus several times on the same subject which is 3 meters away, the AF may lock anywhere from 1 m to infinity.I am not sure if this is the lens or the camera AF system which causes such behaviour.

Most impressive? The \"HSM\" or \"Hyper-sonic Motor.\" It's incredibly fast and quiet. You don't hear the a motor grinding its way into focus as you do with other lenses (you know who you are!).  Absolutely quiet.  And take a peak at the glass.  It's beautiful.  I haven't had a problem with ghosting at all.  And, I've taken some breathtakingly sharp shots with this lens.  Distortion?  Yes, at the extremes.  But, it's almost to be expected from a lens just a step away from being a fisheye lens.  I consider distortion from this lens as a non-issue.

In fact, I was impressed enough to purchase another Sigma: the 30mm F1.4 EX DC HSM.  Another great lens!Here's my update:This lens developed focusing issues a while back.  I'd describe the issues as an inability to lock in on an object and stay locked in.  The auto-focus mechanism, which has always been very quiet, quick and accurate, now seems to bounce around from near to far searching for a focus point before actually finding one.  This causes a delay in getting the shot - and the delay can range from a second to entirely preventing the shot from being taken (during that particular attempted shutter actuation). Even when the lens is directed towards a specific object - with sharp lines - it's as if the lens is being used at night and there is nothing to focus on.  Under those circumstances, the internal focus ring will quickly swing back and forth and then, having found nothing, will stop (as if to prompt the use to try another target.  The warranty has expired (not a 5 year warranty like Nikon) so if I want to fix it, I'll have to foot the bill myself.(I ended up buying the Tokina 16-24mm - very, very nice lens).I'm even more disturbed by this \"quirk\" because I've got two other Sigma lens which have had their own issues as well!  Am I incredibly unlucky?I've got a Sigma 70-200mm f/2.8 DG HSM II Macro Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras.

That was usually \"wide-enough\" for me, but there were occasions where I couldn't *quite* frame the photo the way I wanted.  Couldn't *quite* fit it all in the frame.  As this lens has been out for a few years, I've toyed on and off with buying one.  I finally recently did, and I'm blown away.I should have bought this lens 4 years ago.  This lens has opened my eyes to how restrictive 18mm on a DX-body can be.  You don't understand \"wide\" until you've shot with a lens like this.I'm generally a Nikkor guy.  I love my Nikon bodies, and I generally like to use Nikkor glass.  But I've got to say, this is my second Sigma lens, and both have greatly exceeded my expectations.  The build-quality on this thing is great. Zero regrets.  And for half the price as Nikkor's 10-24mm, it's a good deal.  Optically and mechanically, it seems flawless.  Sharp, contrasty, and not a lot of distortion for as wide as this is.And yes, there's a newer version of this lens, a fixed-aperture f3.5 10-20.  For me it doesn't matter much as I'm mostly using this lens down around 10mm anyway, where the difference between f4 and f3.5 is nearly meaningless.  And it's so wide even at 20mm, that shake issues (due to slow shutter necessitated by f5.6) are mostly a moot point.  IMHO, fixed apertures matter a whole lot more for telephoto lenses than they do for wides, and this lens is super-wide.From a creative standpoint, this lens is astounding.  It's not just about being wide; capturing the whole skyline, the whole meadow, or the whole mountain range. It's really about perspective and depth.  Even a photo of something as mundane as a soda can on a coffee table takes on a whole new perspective (literally!) when shot with a super-wide like this.  Get close.  Really close.  Closer.  Pow!  Your photography will never be the same.  Just as a telephoto lens compresses distance (distant objects seem closer), wide angle really expands distance.  Compose a flower or some other small object up close, with an expansive background landscape, at 10mm, and the resulting photo will nearly leap out at you.  Push it further, closer to the foreground object, and the flower will be enormous while the distant mountain peaks are minuscule.  Amazing creative potential.This lens is about as wide as you can go on a DX body.  It's probably not an 'every-day' or 'walkaround' lens for most people.  Myself included.

So in these situations there is three main things I needed from this lens: - Sharpness - I've already said it, It's sharp! - Controlled C/A - Very little to none I am very impressed and happy here! - Controlled Barrel Distortion - This is a little more pronounced that the Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM that I was renting but again not a deal breaker in my opinion and I feel it is still very well controlled.I love my Canon lenes but for anyone looking to save a few hundred bucks on a ultra wide angle lens, you will not be disappointed by going with the Sigma 10-22mm EX DC HSM.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "This Should Come With Your Camera", "Author": "Damien Margo", "ReviewID": "RP3I0PESRCAA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am shocked about this lens. After many visits to the camera store, hours of internet research, and dozens of questions to professionals I bought this lens from Amazon. No local dealers bothered to carry it so once again the sale went to the internet.During my research it became obvious that one of the major limitations of many new DLSR's is a smaller overall field of view when compared to a traditional film based SLR using the same basic lens. Without going into the \"why\" the bottom line is my Nikon D40X's stock 18-55 cannot capture as wide a shot as I want.Terminology becomes an issue when trying to explain this lens to an amateur, or the person who might be involved with your new 500 dollar purchase. The word \"wide\" has new meaning these days when applied to TV's and monitors, so people are confused when you try to tell them about a lens that is \"wide\". This is significant because so many new D40X buyers, for example, are jumping into SLR for the first time and have no clue about lenses. These are the people who probably have no idea what they are missing.The overall focus on lenses gets further confusing for amateurs because of all the hype about \"zoom\", and when kits like the D40X give you an extra zoom but no wide lens. Zoom is like one of those numbers consumers make sure to ask about before they make their purchase. While zoom photography is cool, I feel the magic of wide-angle photography is a well kept secret. Consumers would be well served to be asking about \"wide\" instead, and start walking the camera up closer to their subject. You'll see why later.Doing research became even harder when I began to read about the Nikkor 12-24 and new 14 wide angle lenses. At $1000 and $1700 I began to feel like my dream would never come true. Then I held the new 14mm at the camera store, attached to a D60. It is a monster in every way. After looking at some dinky conversion lenses I was ready to give up. The amazing reviews of the new Nikon wide-angle lenses left me feeling it might be years away.That's when I found the Sigma 10-20, roughly 5 lenses later. The solid 5 star reviews combined with under-$500 price tag got me looking, and then the test shots. $20 of overnight shipping later I must say this is a product that should come with the camera. All new consumers should be made aware of what this thing can do. It should be bundled or at least sold beside these cameras, not the total mystery it seems to be. This wide angle lens should go into the hands of amateurs and professionals alike. It could be the factor that keeps new people into the hobby when their zoom shots are all messed up. Simply put this lens allows your camera to better match what you see with your eyes. The creative possibilities of a wider field of view should not be underestimated. It could sell more cameras, so it seems the competition should be looking up to Sigma, especially at this price tag.

What I mean is, out of any cheaper wide angle lenses out there, it would be best to spend the few more dollars for this lens.  It comes with a carrying case and hood which is extra nice; considering Canon is charging hundreds more and for whatever reason cannot bring themselves to giving anything away for free.  Speaking of Canon, I'm a Canon guy all the way, and this is the first time I considered straying from Canon Products.  I'm really glad I did.  The reviews on the Canon lens are too iffy to justify paying 200-400 more for roughly the same lens. The photo examples don't give me any justification to pay that kind of extra money either. Some reviews on this lens also seem to be a bit negative, but unless your shooting with the big boys, theres no outstanding reason to upgrade to a more expensive wide angle, as this will cover all of your needs with great clarity and color.  The only real fault that is noticeable with this lens is that amount of distortion at the edges at 10mm.  This is to be expected with such a wide lens, and can simply be solved by shooting closer to 12mm..etc.  However, in some cases, the 10mm distortion actually works in your favor to enhance the height of trees, buildings, and that sort of thing.  (Examples of this exist in the photos regarding this lens).Certainly consider reading others reviews, and go to Canon's lens reviews as well, so you can make your own decisions.

Since there are clearly far more expensive lenses out there with finer workmanship in the body of the lens and the glass, this is pretty darn good.Having said that, I have to say that I have run tests on the lens in real world situations where some features fall short.Sharpness. I am still using my trusty Rebel XTi Kiss 10.10-megapixel which will only carry so much sharpness from any lens due to resolution of the CMOS. The Sigma 10-20 provides equal sharpness from the center to the outsides of its coverage as my Canon 17-40 mm zoom at the same focal lengths.Auto focus. This is where the Sigma can fall short. Based on a Chart test of lines on a flat field at 45 degrees to the camera, the auto focus consistently focuses considerably in front of the focus line regardless of the foual length and choice of camera driven auto focusing method. Having said that, it is seldom in real life that I ever shoot a piece of paper with lines drawn on it. On standard product shots on a white seamless with an object standing up, the focus was accurate both wide open and fully closed down at 10mm to 20mm. But here again, I am not very often going to be using this lens for table top product photography. I tried it shooting the action of kids running around with Alpacas for a client and it took wonderful images, but in this case it often focused too far back, thus throwing important information in the foreground out of focus. I may have to test this using one of the different focusing method internally on the camera. I am used to the massive depth of field of fixed length wide angles, and never had to worry of depth of field when shooting in strong sunlight even with action but these lenses have been designed with the help of computers to achieve such minimum of distortion at different focal lengths that I expect some of the old rules of thumb to no longer apply.Depth of field. Since I will be shooting flooring installations with this lens, one of my main concerns is depth of field on location. So I did do tests on a 4'x8' table top at about a 45 degree angle of downward view. I stretched out builder's rules both from the front bottom to the end of the table and across at bottom right to top left corner of the viewfinder view. I also had an imitation wall standing up at the ends for vertical testing. I shot versions from wide open (something I would never do) to fully closed down (in this case f22). The results were as expected in that the maximum depth of field was certainly at f22 but also the sharpest detail was also at f22. That I did not expect since up until now, I have always expected the middle f-stop to provide the sharpest overall resolution. Frankly, I have enormous respect for the engineers who bend light with the multiple elements to achieve these wide angle zoom views from 10-20mm with so little barrel distortion. Photoshop then can fix what's left.Lens flare. This is always a problem with lenses as the focal length shrinks. I don't find any more of a problem with this lens as with any other super wide lenses. Just don't shoot into the sun! But what's new about that?Ease of use. It would be nice if lens manufacturers all made the outer ring the zoom and the inner the focus or vice versa. I have a feeling that there are some engineering reasons for not doing so. But then this has always been true since I first started photography in 1969. I have always had to fold in the task of working enough with all my lenses to make my fingers habituated to where their controls are without conscious thought. Same is true with cameras that keep changing where you control them. Of course I have the same grip with makers of TV remotes, recorders, auto windshield wiper controls, AC controls and music systems of all kinds.Structural. I have not had this lens long enough nor used it enough (only a couple of weeks) to have a track record yet. But it is solid, nothing sloppy about the controls, clicks into place on my Canon body firmly with no additional movement and is just as easy to heft around in changing out lenses as my Canon lenses are. Some have criticized it for its weight. But I like its weight. It adds stability to the camera. You have a light weight camera and you tend to get more camera movement when you squeeze the shutter. Squeeze right? I hope no one is pushing the shutter button.Contrast, exposure, saturation and color. With my Sigma, all these are well within the good and satisfactory standards. I don't find color shifts, flat or contrasty images nor ones that lack color depth. What I have found is some bleariness out on the outer corners in some scenic shots when shot at 10mm. But then I find that as well on my 17-40mm Canon. It is just a bit more exaggerated at 10mm. So unless I am stuck and have no choice but to use the lens at 10mm, I will tend to keep it between 12-20mm. Since I am a commercial photographer and seldom need to make a super-wide visual design statement, this is a lens I will probably use sparingly but will become a vital tool in my bag especially for architectural and real-estate photography.Nice case that will attach to the belt with good padding comes with it.So overall, I give this lens top marks for its class. Many lenses at higher cost are not as good. I have yet to test it in the field in architectural photography not have I seen 16\"x20\" prints, so I cannot comment on it merits in this application.I hope this helps those of you who, like me, were wondering if I should give the lens a try. I have read, as I am sure you have too, in the posts above this one, that some people have experienced some bad product. But I do hope they have all actually done some rigorous comparison testing. I would recommend this to everyone when you get any lens for the first time. This lens like many of the super wide lenses is like a grand prix racing car in comparison to a family mini-van. You have to exert a lot of control since they can get away from you easily and you can't expect automated camera controls to do everything you need. But that is more about the photographer using the equipment than the equipment itself. If you receive a good version of the lens, while it has a few flaws, it is easy enough to work around them. But this is true with most lenses. Nothing is perfect. You may have to go manual and/or experiment with some of the camera controls you may not have used before.Peter", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overall, a great value.", "Author": "Schuylercat \"Schuylercat\"", "ReviewID": "R1BOM0J9LPQHZ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this instead of the Canon 10-22, and never looked back.

It seems sharper than the comparable Canon zoom which i have played with a couple of times, but that is just a feeling since I have not conducted side by side tests.  On my 7D it seems to be OK, not the sharpest lens by far, but being so wide its hard to tell.  Plus stopped down to f5.6 or f8, especially at a mid zoom of 13 -17 mm, everything is in sharp focus.  Contrast is good, not great, its no Ziess.  But its good, nothing a little tweak in lightroom can't fix.  At 100% crop its not the sharpest lens, and diffraction becomes noticeable above f8 on the 7D, but its still pretty sharp, and far wider than normal.  So I am willing to overlook a slight loss of resolution for the final image this allows me to get.  The final images are detailed and colorful with decent distortion control and not too much CA.  Of course there is no bokeh, just generic out of focus if you are sloppy.  I can almost touch my subject with this lens on the camera, you can get that close.  I think I can focus down to 4 or 5 inches reliably.  LR3 and CS5 do a great job of correcting the distortion and adjusting the perspective shift.

Please note that this lens is for Nikon DX & FX cameras but is somewhat crippled on an FX camera such as the D3 or D700 because the bigger sensor on FX cameras is so big that it picks up the barrel of you lens at 10-15mm thus effectively wiping out this range.If you have an FX camera, don't waste you money on this but for a DX camera, it's really a must have.

For the Nikon there are a few select must-haves for the price, such as the 35 f/1.8 af-s, and this is one of the others. You get an EX line sigma lens that is sharp, built solid, and is optically ahead of what you pay. While the f/3.5 version is faster, and the 8-16 version is wider, this is a great balance for the price point. If you think the difference in either of the others is worthwhile then certainly they might work better for you, but at 10mm it is wide enough to capture any size room in its entirety. In comparison to the f/3.5 version, the 3.5 is somewhat soft at those larger apertures requiring an increased f stop to get to the same sharpness of this 10-20 variable aperture lens. Another consideration is that this lens takes standard 77mm filters. The 8-16 does not take any, and the f/3.5 version takes 82mm. If you already have standard 77mm ones or are planning to get some fx-sized gear, 77mm is what you will use.In comparison to other DX ultra-wides it holds its own in sharpness, has the HSM motor to autofocus on lower end bodies such as the d40/d5000, and even on my D7000 is still sharp enough that with the higher megapixel count I do not have issues with softness anywhere in the frame, edge to edge.

They delivered me a lens that matched the enormous respect it has in the photographic community.I use this lens on a Canon EOS 50D and take my word for it...it is WIDE! It is the widest lens I've ever owned and is absolutely perfect for taking group shots at weddings or family gatherings, and it opens up a whole other dimension of photography when I'm just out shooting as a hobbyist/artist.As far as focusing goes: I've zero complaints. When I manually focus (which is how I usually focus, no matter what lens I'm using) I get nice crisp images. But even when I use this lens's autofocusing I get high-quality sharp photos. The autofocusing mechanism is, as promised, whisper quiet and very speedy.This lens also reproduces colors exceptionally well. Whenever I buy a new lens I look particularly at the reds and blues it captures, and this Sigma gives me dazzling colors that are true.But you want to know what really thrills me about this lens? The cost! I cannot even imagine spending around $300 MORE for Canon's 10-22mm lens when this Sigma lens delivers excellent image quality and has a build quality that is rock-solid, very professional-looking and looks great on the camera. Nothing about this lens feels or looks cheap. I just don't see what the extra $300 would have gotten me if I had bought the Canon 10-22mm instead.That extra money certainly would not have gotten me a lens hood and padded lens case, which is what Sigma INCLUDED with this lens. Sigma simply has Canon beat when it comes to what comes in the box.So, if you're looking for a quality wide angle lens that delivers excellent image quality, save a few hundred dollars and go with this Sigma.", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "an awesome addition.....", "Author": "tom george", "ReviewID": "RT3K718IY8L24", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "seems like the first lens we buy after purchasing a camera is the telephoto zoom lens so we can get closer to our subjects......in the words of another photographer, the best zoom lens we have are our legs.....and with this excellent lens, you can walk right up to your subject and take a crisp clear shot and still have all the interesting background in focus also....great for indoor, architecture, and group shots......i recently shot a church dinner with those round tables that seat 8-10.....i was able to hold the camera over my head and with a bounce flash, take an in focus photo of everyone at the table standing only 4-5 away.....the quality is good through out the whole range and it is a very well built quality lens......i have a few friends who own one also and we use this lens all the time.....you'll find yourself grabbing this lens more and more as time goes on......", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect for lanscapes", "Author": "Peter Kubiaczyk \"this and that\"", "ReviewID": "RSH6S1UJYA5IQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent, no visible barrel distortion.

I take time to try and think about the pictures I take but I'm still not that good.I felt like I had hit a plateau with the kit lens that came with my D3200. I wasn't able to get any stunning landscape photos with the stock 18-55mm kit lens. For the most part, I wasn't really noticing that I couldn't compose the photo (when I was in the process of shooting) but when I got the pictures on the big screen, the photos just never awed me.I started to realize that my plateau might be due to my lens. I was traveling through Utah in Caynonlands & Arches National Parks with a friend of mine who is a much better photographer (and who has invested significantly more money in his photo hardware). He was shooting all his landscapes with his 10-22mm wide angle. I never quite stopped to think that a wide angle would be so good for landscapes, but when we reviewed our pictures, it was like night and day. I shot all weekend on my kit lens and he shot all on his wide angle. His pictures were significantly better enough that I bought this lens.I have to say that I love this lens. I don't really have anything technical to back up this statement. I just know that my landscapes come out SOOO much better now. I have found that I shoot landscapes almost always at the widest 10mm setting. The photos are nice and sharp, the focus works as well as it needs to and the photos come out great. If you are considering this lens for outdoor landscapes, you shouldn't feel too limited by the f/4-5.6. I've never had an issue with needing a faster lens; however, I haven't really tried to shoot outdoor landscapes at night yet. I personally would not think it's necessary to spend twice as much for the Nikon lens.Hope this review helps. I'm going to post a couple of my favorite pictures on the user images page.

My take on the pros and con are as follows:Pros:+ Price/value - the least expensive autofocusing ultra-wide angle (UWA) lens for crop sensor.  If you have a good copy it's competitive with the Nikon 10-24 or Canon 10-22.+ Sharp if you have a good copy - the center is sharp wide open and the corners catch up around f/8 to f/11+ Good colors/contrast - I found pictures from the 10-20mm to have better contrast and more saturated colors straight out of camera than the Tamron 17-50mm, a lens that pairs well with this lens at around the same price.+ Solid build quality - no wobbly parts, tightly constructed, and internal focusing (no extending/retracting parts when focusing).  The zoom and focus rings both have a solid feel to them.+ Fast and almost silent autofocus+ Comes with a 5-year warranty, padded case and hood (Canon only provides 1 year and no accessories for their non-L lenses)+ Takes 77mm filters - no vignetting even with non-slim frame filtersCon:- I've mentioned \"if you have a good copy\" several times.  I've tested 5 copies of this total and 3 of them showed some degree of de-centered elements, two obvious.  If a glass lens element or group of elements is not aligned or slightly tilted inside the lens, the effect can show up in pictures.  The effect is that one side (left, right, top or bottom) will be blurry and out of focus while the other side will be sharp and in focus.  To be fair, this isn't a problem limited to this lens - there are copies of the $2000 Nikon 14-24mm or the $1700 Canon 16-35mm that have this problem.  The problem does seem more pronounced in UWA lenses, probably due to the large angle of view.  How do I test for decentering?  Shoot a flat subject (a brick wall, a row of trees or even a grass lawn) but make sure the lens is facing completely perpendicular to the subject.  Shooting at a non-90 degree angle will naturally cause one side to be more out-of-focus, especially at wide apertures.  If the lens is decentered, it will be most apparent at its widest length and aperture (in this case, 10mm f/4) because the most glass is exposed to the sensor.  View the image at 100% on the computer at the sides of the image.  Usually most lenses have one side slightly sharper than the other, but if one side is obviously blurrier than the other then it can be a problem in your real-world shots.  It's a shame that quality control and manufacturing tolerances have not caught up to eliminate this problem and I've heard that it can be quite time-consuming to fix a decentered lens.In short, I recommend this lens for its pros but advise you thoroughly test it out when you get it.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for urban and landscape photos", "Author": "Altavista785", "ReviewID": "R1ABZB2DXZVOY1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used this lens for the last 3 months, and the photos I'm getting are fantastic!

That said I get my hands on a wide variety of camera equipment, this lens is obviously not for long range zoom lens pictures, but thats not what I got it for. It does take great pictures, lets you give different perspectives on things with the wide angle, great clarity in the main focal point, does tend to blur out around the edges in some pictures.

I have this lens paired on a D3100.  My main uses for this lens are landscape (gasp!), HDR (despite no autoexposure bracketing on the D3100 you can still manually adjust the exposure compensation with a tripod), and fishing photography.  For the latter, my personal view of photography in this type of setting is to capture just as much the setting as the angler and fish.  The angle of view at 10mm is great, and allows me to capture many elements in a single image.  Objects nearer to the camera appear much larger than objects further away, sometimes even too much.  This is nothing unique to this lens; all wide-angles will give you this effect.Is this lens fun?  Heck yeah.  Is this lens perfect?  No.  Pretty dramatic keystoning at 10mm, gradually reducing as you increase in focal length.  This is easy to fix in post though and not a huge issue, though somewhat annoying.  You may have to account for the corrections before you take a shot though.  For example, if you are shooting a star trail with an object off-center at 10mm and trying to keep the north star somewhere near the top of your frame the foreground object will likely be leaning and if you want to remove the lean you may end up losing the north star.  This lens needs a lot of light to produce really sharp images, but that's to be expected from a variable aperture f/4-5.6 lens.  A friend has pictures from the Bahamas and they are marvelous with all the light the tropics get.  Corner softness is another issue if you are shooting something other than large landscapes.  Build quality feels nice.  Consult the lens tests on DPReview before purchasing this lens to understand where it performs best.  I concur with DPReview's conclusion that at f/8-11 the lens is its sharpest.  Good weight to it and the zoom and focus rings are smooth.  If someone tried to mug me while I had this lens in hand I feel confident I could knock them out cold (though perhaps at the expense of the lens, build quality is good but not THAT good).I have not had a chance to play with Nikon 12-24mm and compare the differences, but really at about 3X the price it's probably not even close to a fair comparison.  So, for the price this is an excellent lens.  There's a reason it is so well liked by LOTS of people.  If there was an option to give ratings of 1/2 stars I would give this lens 4.5/5.

Nothing fantastic about it, but it does feel fairly solid. It's mostly plastic, but it doesn't feel like cheap plastic. It is an external zoom, so there's a good chance it'll siphon in some dirt here or there. But it's unlikely that you'll shoot this often enough to have dirt accumulate.Features: 3.8/5It's got a very smooth zoom and focus rotation. Feels like butter almost, so that's a plus. Has full time manual. Has an AF/MF switch, but that's pretty common these days. Autofocus is good enough (not fast, not slow, accurate enough). HSM is quiet, and I never notice any focusing sounds (doesn't mean that they don't exist - it's just not loud enough to bother me). It does lack OS (optical stabilization), but is that something a wide angle lens really needs? Also, it'd be nice if there were a zoom ring lock. I feel like a lot of people use this lens mostly for its 10mm focal length, but the zoom ring is so smooth that it slips out of place ALL THE TIME. You'll have to get used to checking the ring every time you shoot. That's about all there is to the features.Price: 4.5/5As for what you get for what you pay, this lens is awesome. You'll find very few lenses out there cheaper than this while offering more. As for the Sigma 10-20mm f/3.5, consider if you really want to pay $150 more for a 3.5. For the most part, I use this to shoot landscapes, which usually requires a fairly narrow aperture (like f/9 or f/16). Also for the most part (99.5% of the time), I use only the 10mm focal length, where you can have the minimum aperture at f/4. So 1/3 of a stop really worth $150? (The answer is no.)Practicality: 3.8/5I have a hard time using this lens more than 15% of the time. My other two lenses include the Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8 and the Canon 70-200mm f/4. Both lenses are noticeably sharp, even without pixel peeping. Both lenses offer me a variety of focal lengths. Still, I suppose it really depends on the photographer. If you like a wider angle, you may enjoy this lens a lot more than I do (and I still do enjoy this lens).Overall: 3.9/5Good lens overall. It'd be nice if the lens was sharper overall. Even if corner sharpness can't be corrected, it'd be nice if the center were sharper. A lot of it really does look like rubbish at 100% crop.

Unfortunately, however, at 20mm the vignetting is the worst of all focal lengths, which looks great in some photos and not good in others. It can only be partially corrected in PS.In all focal lengths besides 20mm, the image becomes softer and softer on the edges as you approach 10mm. At 10mm, virtually every photo I took is unusable without cropping a few inches off each side of the photo. At 10mm, the edges are so soft that they look blurry and out of focus. Only the odd shot with leaves or water on both sides of the frame will forgive this weakness. From 11-15mm it is a little better but not much better. 16-20mm seemed to be the sweet spot for this lens with an emphasis on the 18-20mm part.Now, I now that this is to be expected somewhat with ultra-wide angle photography, and I am not claiming that the Tokina--or any other lens--is perfect in this respect either. The Tokina is, however, much less worse. At 12mm the Tokina is soft in the edges but not so much that it looks blurry or out of focus; it is as soft in the corners as you would expect an ultra-wide angle photo to be. Anyway, after shooting with this lens daily for a few weeks and seeing the results each night, the lens had a way of forcing me to stay as close to 20mm as possible. I was really disappointed to have to do so given that I would rather just have a 20mm lens than have a 10-20mm zoom that forced me to stay as close to 20mm as possible. I know a big attraction to this lens is the 10mm number, but I can't help but wonder if they got there by fudging the quality a little bit. I have resold this lens and will not buy it again. I will stick to the Tokina or a wide-angle prime in the future. I really wanted to like this lens but unfortunately it is only adequate.

The Canon models are surely nice, but are all quite a bit more expensive than this. All of my other lenses are Canon brand lenses, so I was a bit worried about the quality of a brand like Sigma. Well, I've been very happy with it. Build-wise, it holds up to a Canon brand lens 100%.The HSM motor behaves exactly like the USM in my EF 50mm f/1.4, and the focus meter is handy. The focus ring is actually smoother than on the EF 50mm f/1.4. I don't mind the relatively small maximum aperture of f/4 because I basically only shoot at f/10 or thereabouts for maximum sharpness. Shots in the larger aperture range don't have a lot of sharpness on any lens of this focal length.One other thing worth noting is I chose this lens over a similar competitor's lens because this is an EF mount (not EF-S), whereas the other was designed for crop-sensor bodies. I try to get full frame lenses whenever possible. However, although this lens will mount on a full frame body, you will get a vignette - so although it's an EF mount, it may as well be EF-S.Finally, to potential buyers: this lens, sold new, should come with a lens hood, zip-up lens case/bag, and a warranty card.

I bought a this lens for my Canon to use for landscapes and museums. I do own a Canon 70-200 F4L, the Canon 50 mm F2.8 prime, the a Tamron 28-75 but I really wanted a lens that I could use to take shots of tall buildings or items at museums where there's not a lot of room to back out of or at gatherings where there's just a lot of people to compose a shot and I was thinking this lens will make my bag more complete.. First impression - \"So much fun!\"I bought the lens from another online store. When I received the lens, I immediately started taking test shots. I was amazed at the possibilities that you could do with this ultra-wide lens. At 10mm, it's so wide that it makes cramped rooms look so big, allows me to frame a much wider area than possible with non-ultrawide lenses, makes targets at close distance appear very far. I immediately understood what people meant when when they said that this lens is \"fun\".. But ... first copy was bad - really bad!I also immediately realized that the lens wasn't sharp. I tried from F4.5 to F12 and the pictures were not sharp, however, I wasn't sure if it was because it was dark when I testing and the lens was having trouble focusing or maybe the lens was really not as good as people were saying. Then, I used a tripod and upped the exposure time. The images came back a little sharper but not as good as thought. So I tried taking pictures at daytime. To my dismay, the pictures didn't come back sharp - a picture of a store signage from 30 feet came back with letters a little blurry when zoomed in. When I zoomed into moldings in photos of buildings, the moldings were lifeless - there were no details, like the ones that you'd get when using a kit lens but the ones I got were probably a little worse that those from a kit lens.And to make matters worse, I saw what others were also complaining about - the left side of the already unsharp images were even less sharp than the right side.So, already being disappointed and feeling cheated, now I had to go through the trouble of getting and RMA from the seller, re-packaging the lens and shipping it back. I tried buying from Amazon thinking I might have to try several times and it would be easier to work with Amazon when it comes to this scenario.. 2nd copy is so much betterI got my copy 3 days ago. I immediately tested it when I got back from work - which was in the night. The images were a little better. I was able to get sharper images at F7x - at least sharper than the previous copy. However, I had doubts and needed to see day shots to convince myself. I got a chance to test it yesterday when the sun came out here in the North East. I set the aperture to F7x as that's acceptable to me. (I haven't tested below that that much although I plan to do so) I took a picture of a building that I took a photo of with the previous copy to see if its any better. To my relief, the photos had more details. I could see details of the moldings that I didn't see before using the previous copy. I took more shots outside to convince myself. The pictures came back sharp. I was able to read plate numbers of \"distant\" cars.. Little or very less vignettingI was amazed that I couldn't see the vignetting that some people complained about. Maybe it's there but I just couldn't tell.. Great color renditionThere is something about this lens that makes the colors come really good - and I'm just using a regular UV filter. Maybe it's an effect that you get from an UW lens? - I don't know.. Fast AFReally satisfied with the autofocus speed. I've been shooting with just the center AF though and so far no complaints here.. No AF/Manual switch on othersI noticed that the AF/Manual switch was missing on my previous \"bad\" copy. This new \"good\" one has it.. What noise?Maybe I got really fortunate the 2nd time around. I've read about others complaining about the autofocus noise. I just don't have that. I suggest you return your copy and get a new one.. Not for the very darkI usually avoid using flash even in the dark. I found it ok to use this on not-so-bright situations - I was able to get decent photos even when hand-held at 1/25 in a room where the only lights were coming from the chandelier. But in dark situations, I'd have to use a tripod and depending on how dark it is I'd have to up the ISO or be forced to use a flash which I haven't done so.. Good buildHard and kind of a little-rubbery plastic. At least, to me, it feels sturdy and comfortable when zooming in and out. The zoom ring is smooth doesn't feel loose - just the way I like it.. Relatively not heavyI could walk around with this lens without hurting my neck. I'd disagree with those that say this is heavy. I do own a heavy lens that I just would not walk around on my neck with for a long time. This one, although, I won't call it very light, it is on the lighter side.. In summaryI hope to come back and write a few more of my observations and post sample photos. If you get lousy shots on a newly-bought copy of this lens, get another copy. Once you get a good copy, you'll get sharp photos - this should be much sharper than a kit lens and I'd say a little less sharp than what I see with an L lens but that's expected here - at this price, the sharpness is excellent.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Loving This Lens", "Author": "Cinescout", "ReviewID": "R35Y0NG6MLRJLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I scout locations for movies.

I bought the lens from the store, not Amazon, paying a bit more because of the opportunity to compare the lenses.  So with the addition of this lens, my range is 10-20, 18-105 & 28-300.Oh, and by the way, the D90 is an amazing camera.

I stupidly sold it a couple years ago, and have missed having an ultrawide zoom ever since. Since money's tight these days, a new one of those was out of the question, and even used ones are creeping up on $700 now, so I opted for the Sigma.I like this lens a lot. The variable aperture and the rather slow max aperture don't really bother me, as I'm using it mainly outdoors in daylight or indoors with a flash. Color and contrast are ok, not in the realm of an L lens, but neither is the price. Flare is controlled well both by the coatings and the included hood. Sharpness is pretty good, not amazing, but good. The one glaring drawback is the amount of barrel distortion. WOW! I was expecting some, but this puppy might as well be advertised as a fisheye. It can be fixed somewhat in post, but then you lose so much of the image you might as well shoot with a 50mm to start off with. Again, I realize it's a sub $500 lens, and I'm unfairly comparing it to the Canon, but my plans to use it for interior shots of my wife's real estate listings are kinda shot. I'll keep it and learn to use it to it's strengths however. I think it will be a lot of fun and offer some pretty cool images once I get in the mindset of exploiting the distortion to get the desired effect.Buy this lens for landscapes and dramatic near fisheye type shots.

I had the infamous adequate but not impressive kit lens 18-55mm, telephoto 70-250mm, and the excellent macro 60mm (can't say enough good about that one). But I needed a wide angle for emphasizing subjects and the fun of distorting perspective (the old hold the fish closer to the camera to make it look bigger trick etc.) Canon is too proud of their 10-20mm lens and at nearly twice the price of the Sigma it was out of my budget.  I read the reviews on the lens and it was a mixed bag, everthing from great to trash so I was a little concerned. I took the leap and made the purchase. I ordered on a Friday,it was here on Thursday. It comes with a lens hood and a nice padded nylon carrying case (are you listening Canon?) But alas when I tested the lens, evrything farther than 3 ft away was soft as a new marshmallow! I tried all zoom/f stop combinations to make sure and it was consistantly soft beyond a meter. I promptly jumped on line and went through the online return process that gives you a return label to slap on the box. I packed it up,took it to the post office, and shipped it back. In the mean time, Amazon sent me an email asking whether I wanted credit or another lens to which I answered I still wanted the lens. To AMAZON'S credit they had the lens to me THE NEXT DAY and even credited my account for the shipping and insurance costs on the returned lens. The next day I got the lens and began shooting again this time with much better results. I have been shooting with the lens for 2 months now and I am finding new uses for it. It is acceptably sharp to infinity this time and very sharp at 15 feet or less. I am content with this lens and very impressed with AMAZON customer service. I laugh when I read others review of the lens saying it is no good for architecture- It's a wide angle! it distorts! that's what it does!And quite well too.  This a P.S. to the review now that I have shot a few thousand frames through it. It has wonderful contrast and color rendition. It is a very excellent lens and if you don't get a good one the first time (like me-turn it in!) I am very happy with this lens- the colors snap!

In this part of the country the two things sometimes overlap because some of the same forts were used as the Cavalry drove the Indians along the Trail of Tears (one quarter of them died along the way). The lens was purchased so I could shoot panoramic views of battlefields and gun emplacements, as well as wide shots of forts, barracks, etc. The lens that came with my K200 Pentax (great camera)--the 18-55 kit lens--has limited wide-angle possibilities, thus the Sigma 10-20. So far I haven't been to any new battlefield sites to test it, but, being a lazy photographer, I have left it on my camera after testing it, taking indoor shots of large paintings and close-ups of items I'm trying to sell on Ebay. Most of the stuff looks as good as it does with the kit lens, although I noticed a lot of blurring when I tried to get a little closer than the lens is designed to shoot (even though my camera is one of those shake-proof jobs).

UPS delivered it to my post office & the local post office lost it for a day & delayed the delivery. If UPS got it to my town why not deliver it to me & not my post office? The shipping box was nearly destroyed, but the contents were in excellent shape... just late.On to the lens...I so desperately wanted to like this lens.  I purchased it about 2 weeks ago from Amazon and have put it thru it's paces only to decide to return it.  It may be a calibration issue between my camera and this copy of the lens, but I doubt it.  Here are my issues (good & bad):good:1) well built2) fit the canon body nicely3) angle of view was exactly what I wanted (unmeasured, but felt about 160 degrees).4) edge distortion was acceptable to me (it is a wide angle)5) acceptable vignetting in my opinion.bad:1) the reason I am returning -> about 50% of my photos were out of focus (over the whole image). It was not just soft, it flat out of focus.  I tried using a tripod, different ISO, different apertures, indoor & handheld. Was not consistent.  It was better outside, but still not good enough.2) The sensitivity to light was hard to control.  I shoot with a Canon Xs & I think it defaults to overexposed in general (typically shoot -1 to -2/3 as my default). With the Sigma I was set at least at -2.  I could get used to it, just different.3) When I did get an image that is \"in focus\" the detail at the edge of the image is fairly degraded, lacked any measure of focus.4) I shoot a lot of hand held interior shots.  The f/4 of this lens made this difficult.  I knew this could be an issue when I bought it, but I did not know how much of an issue until I had it in hand.I shoot for hobby, but am an architect & frequently am called upon to shoot interiors for clients.  The images would be fine as a thumbnail, or possibly an insert on letter sized paper.  However, I did not feel that I could rely on this lens to give me good enough shots to ever submit anything larger than a 4x6 print to a client (surely not anything 8x10-16x20).I went to a local camera shop and tried out one of their off-the-shelf sigmas (not my copy) against the tamron 10-24mm & my kit lens. The guy behind the counter said that I should go with the tamron before I even started (but I rarely trus much of what most salesmen say).  Their copy of the Sigma had the same issues/results on every point listed above (this leads me to believe that it is the series of lenses, not my particular copy of the lens that is the problem).  I know the kit lens for canon is not the pinnacle, but it is a measurement I am familiar with.  In my opinion the tamron was about 90%-95% of the quality that I would want in a wide angle. There is a $50 rebate on the tamron thru Dec 31 & with tax, I can get the tamron for virtually the same cost as the Sigma.Like I said, I really wanted to like this lens, but it was not good enough.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great lens", "Author": "Ralphpb123", "ReviewID": "R2KT56J738A09Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great lens for the price.

Also is most likely to have flare on.Also 10mm is \"enough\", in that I use 12-14 most often, seldom go down to 10mm not to mention 8mm.On the other hand, I do use 20mm often, so 8-16 is not the perfect choice for me.Of course it depends on each person, but this is just what I learned.Enjoy the UWA photography!", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Quality", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R3L6H3DBDDU1KT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this lens a few months back, and I have loved it ever since.

It made a strange sound, and felt pretty stiff.  I think a piece of dirt or dust must have found it's way in the lens body, because after a few quick turns of the ring the zooming was again butter-smooth.  Like other customers have said, the lens does create a big shadow when you use the built-in flash.  One more thing to take into account is distortion.  Near the edges it will make tall straight objects look bent inwards.  But hey, it's a 10mm focal length!

I'm just a camera enthusiast/hobbyist who likes to take hopefully, pretty decent pictures. I have bought several Sigma zoom lenses through the years and have not been disappointed yet. I shoot mostly outdoor nature stuff. I use a Canon Rebel XS and for my wider shoots I've used the Canon 18-55 mm @ the 18 mm setting. It never seemed to take in enough of the overall view I was looking for in a final photo. This lens does it.I had done  the usual searches and reviews on ultra wide's that most of us do before deciding to make a purchase.  After hours/days on the computer, I went down to my local camera store and they just happened to have  the Sigma there and on sale.  They put it on a Canon body and told me to go outside and snap off a dozen or so pictures.Wow, what a difference between an 18 mm view and a 10 mm. I can see why they say that this lens if perfect for realtors. Indoors, you get the whole room in nice clear focus. Outdoors, oh my gosh!  Especially with a CL polarizer.My first real use was in Maui. Seascapes, landscapes and sunsets, fantastic. I don't know if you can take a bad picture there though.Now I get the full view I was looking for and you get to be more creative using an ultra wide lens. Clouds seem to be zooming over your head in nature scenes. On a beach, it seems as though the waves are touching your toes. It's not a fish eye, that for sure. Nice straight lines. This ultra wide lens does take very unique photos that you simply can't get from regular zoom lens.The Sigma focus is fast in daylight conditions. A littler slower in low light. Though sunsets were no problem. All developed pictures have been spot on.Sorry for not being too technical on this review but I don't have that kind of background. Finished photos were very clean edge to edge.Seems to be well built . Easy to use. No creep. Shipped in nicely padded Sigma lens case.Warranty right on top.

I also completely underestimated the sharpness of this lens the first few months.However, if you've been out in the field, or even shooting indoors at home you know sometimes a 50mm just won't cut it, and can be inconvenient in certain situations. This is when I started switching to this lens to accommodate those situations. This is also when, in post production, I realized what it was that I had.This lens is sharp. Not the sharpest, but pretty damn sharp. It's beyond convenient in any environment I'm involved in. The AF when needed on the fly is very fast (and I'm using a T3i Rebel) and makes for some awesome close ups. Naturally a wide angle lens is something you can always have a lot of fun with.The thing I like though is unless I'm REALLY close in the 10-15mm range, it doesn't give too much of that bowl effect actually. If you want that effect you can certain achieve it, but the majority of my shots looks \"normal\" if you will.I do a lot of Photography for a pet rescue volunteer organization. This lens is my number 1 on site lens now. It allows me to be fast and mobile, and gives me a wide range of options for my shots. I'm always impressed in post production by what I see. I really, couldn't be happier.If you're thinking about it, do it.

I'm using it on an Canon EOS Rebel XS 10.1-Megapixel Digital SLR Camera - Black (Body Only) and it is running smoothly.  The capture range is ridiculous, it's fast, pretty crisp and overall reliable.  The lens is a bit heavy but expect that for decent glass.  And there is massive distortion on the corners but that's what you should expect when it comes to a near fish-eye capacity.I'm probably really amazed by this because I started off with a fixed Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens and felt so limited in range (I decided against the 18-55mm kit lens, which I financially should've got, but the 50mm is amazing and can shoot at f1.8!).  So to alleviate, I got the complete opposite.  A pricey solution, but much better than getting the Canon brand version of this lens, which is nearly double in cost.The one bad thing about this lens is that it's pretty massive.  Using the internal flash, the lens will create a shadow onto your photos.  A way to alleviate this is to get an external flash, bigger than the Canon Speedlite 270EX Flash for Canon Digital SLR Cameras.  Those are still too low from the camera and will still create a shadow when the flash is facing forward.  Bounce flash solves this, but you also run into the problem of the wide-angle-ness capturing the line of light onto walls.  Essentially, shooting at 10mm isn't the best for flash, but zoomed in should be alright.Hopefully this rambling helps.

I was using it with my Canon Rebel T2i.First the positive: Exceptional build quality, comes with a case and hood, and you can't beat the price!  There is no doubt this thing is wide!Now the negative.  The autofocus seemed slow and hit or miss with my camera.  This wasn't nearly as much of a problem as the SOFTNESS, or should I say the inconsistent softness.  Wide open it was definitely soft around the edges, and sometimes even soft in the center.  Stopping down there were certain apertures/zoom combinations where the picture would come out completely tack sharp all around, but then you stop down just a step further and it's back to being soft around the edges, and moreso on the left side of the picture.  In all fairness, I'm pretty sure the lens had some problems that I shouldn't use for passing final judgement on a \"good version\".  The tack sharp pictures definitely showed the potential of this lens.  With that said, maybe this was unrealistic expectations on my part, but the distortion present at 10-12mm is worthy of the circus.Overall though, I'm not dealing with whether or not I can get a good copy.  I gave it one shot and it didn't pass so I returned the lens.  In comparing with my Canon 17-55 F2.8 and it's ridiculous sharpness I just couldn't get over the softness.

Being a relatively new digital photographer, taking that first dive in spending $400+ on a camera lens was quite the dive. But now looking at how beautiful and satisfied I am, I want to dive again with Sigma!I purchased this for a trip to Japan mainly to take landscape pictures, but it turned out to be a useful all around lens.  I even use it for macro shots that I know I need to grab that extra wide-angle.  For landscape shots on buildings, my stock lens kit would only capture a few windows and a door of a building while this lens captures the entire building with some of the neighboring buildings next door!  The thing is super wide!! One thing to note is that being that the lens is so wide, it does kind of distort indoor shots to a kind of fish-eye look.  To me this is a good thing as I think the effect looks really cool, but to others it may not be their cup of tea. Because of this effect it may make for a good indoor camera for realtors looking to capture the entire room in a few shots.Overall, I highly recommend this lens.  Like I said if I had to choose one lens for a trip, this would be the one I grab because it can function in many different ways even if it wasn't meant to do so.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Favorite Lens By Far", "Author": "Robert H.

It locks on to my Canon 300D and 400D XTi solidly with no slop and responds to all commands, AF, Av, Tv, etc.I have taken half a dozen shots and they have all been clear and sharp without enlarging or in depth investigation. Distortion is typical of what you would expect in this focal length, exaggerating all the mid range distortions. I did manage to get some very respectable non-distorted images by carefully controlling the angles of the POV.The last observation is that it looks good.

If you're like me and want to be able to capture full-frame pictures (such as close-up buildings or wider landscapes) this is the lens for you.

This will be your jack-of-all-trades lens.2) Wide Angle Lens (This one) - I originally purchased lens 3 first, but in retrospect I should have purchased this one first, as I use it much more often than...3) Distance Shooting Lens - I rarely use this as most things I need to zoom in on are covered by the 55mm zoom. If you have a specific reason for using this, I would suggest you get it, but 1& 2 should suffice for the vast majority of camera shots, in my humble opinion.Please note that I am not a professional - I simply wanted to improve the quality of my photographs while I have been traveling abroad.

With few exceptions, digital cameras self zoom a bit. So all lenses are more close up than their lens ratings would lead you to believe.To go wide angle, in digital, you have to go very wide. But very wide angle lenses bring in some flaky things in color, dark corners, glare rings, and things to make nearly excellent shots just nice.. but .....mmmmmmThe ZOOM wide angle lenses magnify the weird stuff. So high quality wide angle usually means NOT zoom. The Tamron entry seemed to go wide enough that the SLR had that one all purpose lens which the film SLRs enjoy.This is not that lens. The is - for digital - a really wide angle lens. The 10mm is crazy wide - in a zoom? But it works. Used outside, or in the right circumstances inside, is excellent. It is not the ONE lens for your SLR, unless you really don't like ever getting close up.I have this Russian made super crazy wide fixed focal length lens (nearly 180 degrees) which with adapter fits nearly anything. It is good at that very rare crazy wide shot. But this Sigma lens has all the auto features and graceful adaptation to being outdoors - where how wide varies with what direction.

The Nikon lens looked great as usual but the Sigma was blurry except the center and my grey house was WHITE. Very disappointing.

Red Flag on Sigma from now on.Now granted I use Auto mostly and that's why I bought a DSLR, to just get good photos without much photography knowledge. Needless to say this could of been part of it, but the blurry edges on a sunny day seemed odd.Never owned a Sigma product and will be very leery of them.On a positive note I found out that Tokina is releasing a new version of their 11-16mm that will have auto focus for us DX users. The original was reviewed on Ken Rockwell as the best ultra wide available. So hopefully the newer version will be as good. The release is delayed until September?
