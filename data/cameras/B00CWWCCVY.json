As I read the specs further, I was impressed by the array of social sharing options and the 21x optical zoom lens. I bought the Samsung camera and I am fairly impressed with the thing, for what it is: A consumer-friendly touch-heavy camera with some prosumer hardware.Pros:\u2014 Fast CPU and Android OS gives you a bunch of flexibility and apps!\u2014 Huge, bright screen give you the full view of everything the lens can see\u2014 21x optical zoom; it doesn't get much better than this on a consumer camera!\u2014 1080p video with auto-focus and zoom while shooting!\u2014 4 fps photo mode at 16 MP; impressive capture speed (I'm using a 64 GB Class 10 SDXC card)\u2014 Wi-fi, Bluetooth, GPS geotagging, and cellular dataCons:\u2014 Horrible ergonomics for pro camera users (it takes some getting used to)\u2014 Daylight and action/angle shooting is tough when depending on an LCD screen\u2014 Color: Camera tends to push red and occasionally crush dark tones\u2014 Micro HDMI port is on the bottom: Very clunky for setting down to hook camera up to TV for viewing\u2014 Syncing with Mac OS (iPhoto) can be a pain. Android File Transfer works better than Kies to get both photos and video off the camera. The camera's OS does not properly follow DCIM protocol so it requires third-party software to be recognized on the Mac.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice and advanced product.", "Author": "Carlos Alencar", "ReviewID": "R1S322DV3VNMHC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is amazing to have a machine counting on the whole resources of an android device.

I happened to visit my local AT&T; store to upgrade my phone, and noticed the Galaxy camera.  At first I was surprised to see a camera at the AT&T; store and wondered why someone would want to pay a monthly data plan for such a thing.  After playing with the camera for a bit, I was sold by the added features of Android - so I turned into one of those \"dummies\" willing to pay a data plan (AT&T; sees it as a tablet, so it's only $10 a month when added to a family plan).I did have to get my first unit exchanged due to a scratch inside the lens that was affecting all my pictures, but other than that, I have loved the Galaxy camera.  Picture quality is great for a point and shoot - of course not Olympus PEN or Sony NEX quality, but it's good.  What sets this camera apart from others is the mobile broadband and Android capabilities.  As a hobby photographer, I can now take pictures on the go while backing them all up into Google+ without having to search for WiFi or worry that my memory card might fail and I'll loose all my images.  When I get home, I can quickly download all my images without having to sync the camera (although the downloading does take longer than syncing).Here's a few benefits I have found in using this camera...-I can upload pictures to my Flickr account from anywhere (although Flicker's app doesn't support the Galaxy camera, I use an app called Flickr Uploader-If I don't know what a landmark is, I can rely on Google Goggles to find out for me (it's like a search engine where you search with images instead of words)-I can take pictures of stuff around the house, or even at yard sales, and list items on eBay from anywhere.There are also non-picture benefits, like using Google maps, getting the latest news updates while on the go, and the latest weather reports.  I can also play games while bored - which is a plus.  Recently I also purchased a Samsung S4, and it uses the same battery as this camera, so if my battery dies, my smart phone can be sacrificed.There are a few things I don't like, but I think the benefits outweigh these, so I'm not taking a star off the review...-I wish manual mode on the camera were more friendly - it's a nice to have, but impossible to use on a touch screen-Battery life isn't so good, but AT&T; gave me an extra battery and charger for free.  One thing to consider is getting the battery the Samsung S4 uses, as it lasts about 1/3 longer on the camera.-Memory card - although I purchased a class 10 MicroSD card, it would be nice if this camera could handle a regular class 10 card, as they cost a lot less.I think I'm sold on the Galaxy Camera, and it is my go to camera for almost everything.  Hopefully it's here to stay and Samsung won't kill it.  If it stays, this is what I would love to see in future versions...-A dial, or two, for added manual control-Option to add a viewfinder-Ability to replace lens (that would be nice)Although there's a lack of accessories for this camera (like cases), I really am happy with it.  I have had it for about two months, and although it doesn't take the best pictures (when compered to other camera I have, of have had), it is currently my favorite camera, and I usually have it one me.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Coolest gadget ever", "Author": "Clifford L.

The camera has far exceeded my expectatiions in performance so far. While shopping for this camera, I was told by salesmen and reviewers online that the EK-GC100 would not take slow motion video (120 fps) like the newer model EK-GC110, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it certainly does take slow motion video. In fact the EK-GC100 does something that the newer EK-GC 110 will not, and that is connect with a 4G network if a person so desires to subscribe to the service.

You mean I can use Google Play to download all the apps that I currently have on my galaxy s4!?\" I thought as I pressed buy now and awaited the package to come in.Waited one day, waited half a day. Gotta love Amazon Prime, Camera's in!After opening the package and looking at the contents I realized I made a huge mistake. The camera is the size of two small digital cameras, the size of two canon digital cameras. The size of a samsung digital point and shoot camera with a screen on the front and on the back, but two of them. It's like putting a large rat in your pocket. It squirms around when you sit down because of it's weird shape and makes you very uncomfortable.All that being said, the camera itself works very well. I'm traveling to Europe to study abroad so I think it's a bit ridiculous to spend $399ish on a camera that may let me play games and edit my pictures.If you're looking for a big camera with the ability to upload directly to any app (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) then this camera is perfect. I'd consider it's size to be equal to a DLSR, one of those gigantic cameras with the zoom. Again, in case you didn't get the point: This camera cannot fit in your pocket.Why I returned this item (and am awaiting my money back - day 2):--> Too big, like a large rat in my pocket (see above)--> Too expensive--> Why not just buy a Nokia Lumia 1020 for this money?Why I'm giving it three stars:--> Great quality pictures with AMAZING zoom--> Amazing HDish screen which really shows your image clearly with vivid colors--> It's a Samsung camera.

I took my girlfriend on a horse and carriage ride, and sat across from her to get a few photos of her while we were moving though some cobblestone streets... and all the images, unless we were stopped, were out of focus. There was enough light for the focus to work when we were moving- and it worked fine when we were stopped.

I got the International GSM one so that I can buy SIM cards when I travel to have maps and other data access when out of the country.  My Verizon phone is virtually useless outside the country.This camera is pretty big since the screen on the back is as big as my Galaxy Nexus.  The large screen makes it harder to hold since there is very little area to hold it with on the back.  It is very easy to hit the screen accidentally.That said, it is amazing to be able to use it to send emails, use Google Voice and even listen to music or watch Netflix.  I have Google+ automatic photo uploads going, so all my pictures are uploaded automatically as soon as I get to wifi.  Much better than EyeFi, which I could never get working very well.  It should work with Dropbox photo upload as well.The camera app is pretty good, but it has a bit of a strange interface.  It definitely could have been better.  But, it is usable and being able to clearly see the photos after shooting them is nice.  There are also a few Android apps out to enhance and modify the photos.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not good enough", "Author": "Andres G.", "ReviewID": "RUBISQTWYKF5V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice to have Android in a camera, but in general it is slow, so you need to keep it clean so It works good.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Myint Tun", "ReviewID": "R3HN8739QR3OBS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung makes excellent products, almost all my electronics are Samsung, Note 2, Note 3, Galaxy S4 phones, Table 8, Note 10.1\" 2014 Edition.

There are a lot of great pre-loaded settings for taking action shots, group pictures, portraits, landscapes, etc. but there's also the manual mode if you have enough experience to operate a SLR.  I'm still learning so I usually use a pre-set mode, but I do like the options provided to me.The pre-loaded editing software is also wonderful - a few taps of the screen lets you clean up and save your pictures immediately.Obviously the other benefit is the wifi capability.  Personally I haven't bothered to get a sim card for mine - I either wait until I get somewhere with wifi or I Bluetooth it to my phone if I want to post immediately.  The wifi capabilities also give you access to the ap store (obviously) which gives you access to an endless supply of camera/editing aps.Everyone that's played around with my camera (from other laymen to professional photographers) have been suitably impressed.

I also think my expectation were a little to high, I own a DSLR and although I got this camera as my always in my purse goes with me everywhere I go I was expecting DSLR quality and it's not, it's a point and shoot camera with a lot of cool features that I have yet to master. And like any point and shoot (actually every camera) it takes much better pictures outside on nice sunny days, in the dark not so much or I've had a hard time taking non blurry actions shots even when taken in that setting. One of the features I love about the camera is it's recording. It's easy to switch between the 2 settings and as mom I love being able to go back and forth snapping pixs and recording my lil one.
