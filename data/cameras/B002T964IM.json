I just received it for my birthday. I read reviews on another site prior to using it. They suggested changing the settings put the ISO to 200 (instead of Auto) and Distortion Control ON. Numerous reviews on that site also complained that the pictures seemed grainy on the screen but when in review mode or printed are great. I followed the reviews of others made the changes and waited until I printed some pictures they are perfect, they have turned out wonderfully. For those that haven't returned the camera make these changes hopefully it will help. I am thrilled with mine.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Black Friday Deal will leave you sad every other day!", "Author": "RavensRealm2010", "ReviewID": "R1TE0D8CMUGIV4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at Target as a Black Friday Deal. I figured for $88 Bucks, how could I go wrong? Man, was I wrong! I know that it was only $88 but the picture quality was flat out HORRIBLE at any price! Saying that the pictures were blurry does not come close to explaining just how bad they were.  I was replacing a 5 year old Sony point and shoot and this camera was rated at 10MP, so I figured a huge improvement was in store. Not so in this case. My Blackberry takes equal quality pictures as this camera does....no joke! I returned it and got the Nikon S570 and am very glad that I did. The S570 is leagues better than the S203! The size of the S203 camera is great and it feels like a well made product but at the end of the day if a camera can't do what you need it to do in the way of taking a decent picture, it is worthless! If you are looking for a decent cheap camera, pass up the S203 and spend a few dollars more and get a camera that you can actually use!", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Takes blurry pictures", "Author": "Ashley Sealand \"Ashley Sealand\"", "ReviewID": "RTKDBJVSRB6WN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from Target on Black Friday 2009, and I'm sorry that I did.  I thought that for $88 it was a great deal on a Coolpix, but it seems to be a cheap-o edition produced just to supply the masses with a Nikon camera in their Black Friday quest to get good deals.  It is very easy to use, but it takes pictures which are either blurry or which just don't look as crisp as the images I'm used to getting.  If you just bought this camera, I'd recommend packing it back up in the box and returning it.

Most reviews started to make me think I made a mistake. So I carried it around and took 100 pictures or so. This camera takes an \"SD\" card/ full size. I have an 8G class 4...my camera set at 10megapix. I get 3,000 pictures. So I carried the camera and took pictures, and read the reviews. Most people say it takes \"blury pictures\" or \"bad images\".....when I took my first picture/ the image on the LCD screen did \"look\" a bit blury/but I downloaded the picture to the computer and the picture was GREAT! perhaps the camera LCD screen is a bit under \"made\" but at this price/the pictures DO come out good! it is 10 megapix!  I would have given it 5 stars/ but.....what stopped that was....the \"usb\" /av out is a \"minni\" usb....no big deal- it comes with a cable- but I like having 1 regular usb size for ALL my electronic good's. and the other is...the battery has a charger/that you have to take the battery out to place in the charger/no biggie- not sure yet, but I would like to recharge the battery with the usb cable.... I have had this for a week played around with it and took 100 pictures or more and the battery is still charged!!! even after zooming,and going through the menu several times...All in all it is a good camera,small in size,great pictures,long battery life,very easy to use and understand without reading the user manual...the LCD screen does at times mis-represent the actual picture,but if that is to keep this camera at a low price/ then it is worth it.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Please spend $100 more dollars....", "Author": "Mr. Clean \"Choice\"", "ReviewID": "R1JK2T1L6IRZLG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok, I know a little bit about digital cameras. I'v owned a Cannon powershot for about eight years now that I bout for about 350$, 8 years ago.... Now for that kind of money, you get a good camera.  THIS NIKON CAMERA SUCKS!!!  Yeah it might be ten megapixel but the quality is horrible... Very grainy and distorted looking when uploaded to the computer.

I also own a Nikon D40 slr which is another entry level product and have been very pleased with it.  The s203 was bought just have something small and handy to throw in your pocket/purse when we didn't want to bother with the SLR.  At under $90 I considered it a disposable camera and was hoping to get a 1-2 years out of it.We traveled to Guatemala with this camera (didn't want to get robbed of the slr) to visit family and the camera was used to shoot video and about 300 stills.  It is lightweight and did a phenomenal job for being such a low priced item.  We have also shot toddler times and my first triathlon with this camera and couldn't be happier for the price.Unlike the other reviewers I didn't require much modification to the settings.  I leave the iso auto and set the image quality to high (10mp) and it does the job.

I always thought of Nikon as the top brand in cameras.  After taking about 150 pictures using different settings, it was obvious that this camera is a very low quality excuse for a Nikon.  The pictures were printed by a photo shop, not a home printer.  The pictures were not sharp, and the colors were off not to mention grainy.  I called Nikon and was told \"that is the way it is.\"  I went back to my 7 year old Canon Powershot and the quality is far superior.
