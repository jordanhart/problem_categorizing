{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Wonderful Little Camera...that LOVES Batteries", "Author": "Been There \"World Traveler\"", "ReviewID": "RAIR58U8YJ9HB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you can get past the battery usage factor, you will love this camera!  I bought it after reading good reviews elsewhere (it had just been released and there were no amazon.com reviews at that time).  I wanted something reasonable (but better than a kiddie camera) for my soon-to-be 6 year old niece.  She took the camera everywhere during a trip to Washington, DC and was able to operate it with ease (although she never quite got the concept of the zoom...but that didn't matter to her).What is good about this camera is you can set the program to eliminate \"shake\" or motion from the picture.  If you accidentally moved the camera while taking a photo, it corrects the picture before saving it.  This is simply amazing.  Using this function resulted in superb pictures every time.  When I decided that this function was consuming too much of the battery life, I turned it off, but after a couple of photos it was clear that it improves the photo even when you think you have a pretty steady hand...so I turned it back on.The box included a set of AA batteries but no rechargeable batteries or battery charger.  Those are optional items, as is a cover.  I bought a 4 GB media card for $11 and that is the way to go with this camera.  You'll run out of battery life long before you run out of photo capacity!  After doing some research, I opted for the alkaline batteries recommended by the owner's manual.  I believe that results in superior photos over the rechargeable batteries and was extremely happy with the performance.  For the $93 that I paid, this easily performs on par with my other $300 small digital, although it does consume the batteries like there is no tomorrow!  So make sure you take plenty with you (buy them on sale!) and you'll have a great time with this camera.I really wanted to give this product 5 stars for value & performance, but opted for 4 stars solely because of the battery usage factor.", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Takes good Quality Pictures, terrible parts.", "Author": "A.

It's a bit bigger than some others on the market, but that's because it uses regular AA batteries (2) rather than having to charge via AC or USB plug like some other cameras.

Zoom is pretty good as well and the camera comes with USB cord, so download is easy as well....overall, an excellent camera I would recommend.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Takes nice pics and movies; a certified battery punisher", "Author": "Iconophoric", "ReviewID": "R2GCQG2TBTHV7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The manual that comes with the sl30 recommends Alkaline batteries or rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. I have found that, no matter which type you use, this camera goes through batteries much more quickly than my previous point and shoot, the Canon Powershot A95. I believe the problem is in the design. The Powershot used 4 AA cells and had a smaller display, and the Samsung sl30, with a larger display, uses only two AA cells. This design choice kept the camera compact and light. But I think Samsung was somewhat disingenuous in making the calculated decision to get the consumer in the door with the sexiness of this little camera, and then leave them holding the bag when it comes to the most routine aspect of ownership/upkeep.Whereas I was able to take the Canon along for a nine hour day at Disneyland this summer and never give a second thought about battery life, the Samsung sl30 has depleted one of it's three bars indicating battery power left just in casual (not constant) shooting around the house and yard for less than an hour total. 30 more shots and a couple of short movies later, and time to reload. (A friend says that sudden battery depletion is a characteristic of rechargeables: two or three bars indicating battery health one minute, then kaput the next. I can't swear that this is always or even often true, but since I have had this camera, I have seen things which make me believe it. I have seen it go from three bars -- full battery indicator -- to the dread battery replacement message in the space of less than five minutes, on the next power-up.)So the consumer has two choices with this camera, as I see it, if they buy it and decide to keep it. You can make a major investment in Alkaline batteries at Megamart, always carrying a couple of sixteen packs of them with you on vacation, and just try to forget that this thing uses batteries like a toy cassette recorder from 1970. Or you can buy a brace of rechargeables and always have a couple of rechargers plugged in back at the hotel with all slots filled.Important note: The Duracell Ni-MH battery recharger I bought just for the batteries specified for this camera (which are rated at 1700 mAh, by the way) lists a recovery time of a whopping five hours. Yes, I said \"five hours\". With the Samsung sl30, spontanaeity -- that selling point so beloved by advertisers, that quality so coveted by consumers of cameras of this class -- certainly takes a back seat to old school camera nerd/hobbyist planning ahead and lugging extra supplies around.To explain my rating, I give the camera almost 5 stars for the quality of pics it takes, and ease of use. (The flash on the sl30 is more forgiving than the super-hot flash on the Canon Powershot A95; this was my one complaint with the Canon the whole time I had it.) I allow it a somewhat generous 3 stars because of the battery problem. Net out around 4.Not a terrible camera. But I think it's important that you know what you're getting into when you buy this camera. If getting on the battery-buying or battery-stress track is a deal breaker for you, you might want to look at a different camera.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "So far, so good", "Author": "monkeybutt", "ReviewID": "R11SOECBHL6B6R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my kids (ages 6 and 8).

After reading previous reviews, I was somewhat concerned about battery life even though I prefer the easy to replace AA batteries in this model. After using the camera inside and outside to become familiar with its functions, I found it to be simple to understand and easy to change settings. The pictures were bright and clear. The batteries lasted through my trial run easily. I replaced the batteries with fresh top of the line Mallory batteries before our trip and we were off on vacation. Over a period of several days, I snapped over 200 pictures inside with flash as well as outside under a variety of conditions, on the bright and sunny beaches in the \"beach\" mode; beautiful sunsets in the \"sunset\" mode; close up shots of the many flowers and even inside in the \"back light\" mode. Under most outside conditions, I had no problem composing a picture on the camera screen. In the bright sun, however, it is a little difficult to make out the screen. It was not usually a problem. I was careful not to keep reviewing my pictures as I do believe that this causes the biggest drain on battery life. I returned home and easily loaded the pictures into my computer Photoshop program. I am very pleased with the quality and exposure of the pictures and am still using the same batteries. I did not use the CD that came with the camera but simply plugged in the enclosed USB cord to download directly to my Photoshop. My computer has Vista and there is no problem with compatibility. The convenience of having a pocket size camera that is ready to use at any moment is something I am very pleased about. I do believe that taking a little time to get used to the camera will provide anyone with a lot of joy.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "PapaSmerf", "ReviewID": "R2NKNIL7031XGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my four year old as a Christmas present. I wanted something that worked well, with a great price.  If it happened to break I wasn't out all that much cash.  I tell you, this camera takes better pictures than my $300 Canon and all other digital cameras I've had.  It takes pictures quickly and reloads the next shot. Colors are warm and images are beautifully focused, even in the hands of a four year old. Regular AA batteries have held up really well until we purchase some rechargeables. Highly recommended. I might even buy another one for myself.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good for the price, a little touchy with dark and bright spots", "Author": "A Customer \"customer12345657\"", "ReviewID": "R38WPCXLK3JGRB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I don't want anyone to be disappointed.  This is not a substitute for a Canon costing twice as much.  It's noisier in dark areas, and more likely to get washed-out areas when extremely bright spots in in the frame.  If you want to minimize imperfections, you will have to pay more.However, all cameras have those issues to some degree, and the good news is that this camera is better than any other I have seen in this price range.  If you want a camera for eighty bucks, this is the first autofocus/zoom camera for that price I have seen which works well.Here's the good news:1. It focuses and takes the picture quickly.  Focusing and capturing the image takes about half a second in most cases.  If you pre-focus by pressing the button halfway, the final click is nearly instant.  Slow focusing is one of the most annoying things you can experience when using a camera for the first time, and it is no problem at all with this one.  Some of Nikon's [more expensive] compact models take twice as long, but this Samsung is on par with most other decent cameras.2. The zoom works fast enough as well.  Not as fast as some really expensive cameras, but some cameras this cheap have a horribly slow zoom.  No real problem here.3. The flash operates fairly fast.  Like a lot of cheap cameras, this one always does a double-flash.  But it does so fast enough that your subjects won't be confused by it, which is a problem with many cheap cameras.  The first flash comes, and everyone's faces drop because they think it is over.  This camera does the double-flash so fast you will hardly notice.4. It powers on and off pretty fast, only requiring about 1 second for either operation.  Nothing sucks more than wanting to take a picture, but missing it because your slow camera thinks you want to stare at the manufacturer's logo for 5 seconds.  Note that powering down can be delayed if the camera is still displaying the brief preview of the image you just took, and the first shot may take up to 4 seconds upon power-up if you are indoors and have the flash turned on.  This is another area where many cheap cameras are bad, but this one is great.5. It has some advanced settings for such a low-priced basic camera.  There is a \"program\" mode, which allows some very basic settings (not aperture or shutter speed though).  One handy setting (applying to all modes) is the choice of how long the picture \"Quick View\", which is when the camera briefly displays the image captured after you take it, is displayed (some cameras call it a \"preview\" even though it is really a post-view).  Options are 3 seconds, 1 second, 0.5 second, or off.  This may seem like a minor setting, but it can be a very annoying difference if you are switching from an old camera to a new one and this feature is different.6. In the final pictures, color is fairly accurate.  Not perfect, but nothing weird.  This is normally only a problem with really cheap models, but this cheap camera seems fine.Some issues:1. The display is not so good.  It's a little darker than the Samsung L100, and it has a grainy and noisy appearance.2. The program mode must be selected by entering the menu.  It would be much handier to have a standard external dial or switch, as many other cameras do.3. When the flash is recharging, you can't change settings... including turning the flash off.  A lot of cheap cameras do this, and I have no idea why, but it's annoying.Important:Don't use alkaline batteries, it will just make you angry.  Cameras use a lot of power, if only in short bursts, and alkaline batteries overheat and waste energy when drained quickly.  It is convenient that, if this camera's batteries die, you can just grab some standard AA alkalines anywhere in a pinch.  But they die really fast.  The included alkalines died before I filled a 256 MB card (though I did delete many images after taking them).  I replaced them with some Lithium AAs which I always have on hand (for my other AA-enabled cameras), and I have already filled the same card once without the battery meter going down.  This camera is not less-efficient than other good cameras, it just isn't effective to use alkaline batteries in cameras regularly.  This one also uses only 2 batteries to make it small, while many better (and larger) cameras which are designed for AAs will take 4 at once.Some older cameras, with no focus or zoom motor, lasted longer on alkaline batteries, but they sucked.Suggested alternatives, if you want to go a step up for more money:1. Canon a1100.  I only played with it briefly, but like most Canons it handles brightness extremes a little better and the pictures are a little sharper.  It also offers an external mode dial which is really handy if you are going to use most of a camera's features.2. Samsung SL201.  More modes, smaller size, and a rechargeable battery.  Similar to the older L100 and L200.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "luvmyludwig", "Author": "C.

Takes good quality pictures and video is surprisingly decent as well. There are a couple of downsides for me:1. Image stabilization doesn't seem to work with the flash. You can't use both at the same time as far as I can tell. I have very shaky hands so if I need the flash I just have to concentrate and take a deep breath before I shoot.2. As others have said, it sucks your battery dry very quickly, so I would use rechargeables if possible, or at least always have a spare set with you. Nothing is worse than having your camera batteries die when you need it the most (I am an avid angler, so this has happened to me too many times lol).I hesitated on choosing this camera because the specs do say it doesn't work with 64 bit Vista. I however have had no problem transferring pictures or videos to my 64 bit OS computer. I'm not sure why it would work for me but not others, but it  does. I didn't install any of the software that came with the camera, I just let Vista install the proper driver when I plugged in the USB port.

The $90 price for 10+ megapixels seemed too good to pass up.In the past I've had Olympus, Fuji and Canon digitals (not a Nikon or Kodak or Sony yet). The Fuji and Canon have been the best... the Olympus ones are okay for most situations, but terrible for focus in lower light settings.This Samsung took okay pictures too, although they did seem a little fuzzy for 10 megapixels. Maybe the lens isn't that great?In any case, the main problem with this camera is that it is a WIMP. I first test-used it to take a few pictures around the house and it seemed okay, so I tried it out taking pictures at the Rose Parade. Even though the specifications say it can handle it, it just would not take many pictures in the 40 to 50 degree weather, failing instead and saying the batteries were bad. These were new alkaline batteries, and I even tested them afterwards and the meter said they were still fresh.I decided to give the camera one more try at an event this weekend, and even though I was inside a building, I had come in from the outside (which was around 50 degrees) more than 20 minutes earlier, and it STILL gave that same error.I tried to give it a somewhat more even review at the Samsung site, but they rejected it. That led me to have an even more skeptical view of the company, considering that it may have lack of support for its product if it fails to represent it fairly and honestly.I cannot take it back to the store, since it is past its 90-day return policy there, so I am just giving it away to someone, and letting them know it's probably only good in the house, where it can be pampered.

I used to keep my camera in my pocket; one day when I took it  out several of the pixels on the right side of the screen (next to the buttons) were dead or discolored. also when I would turn the camera off the power would shut down but the lens wouldn't retract. Lastly the gap between pressing the shutter and taking a picture (with the flash) is too long. So;Pros:Easy to use,Good Picture quality,Portable,Affordable,Fits most tripod units,Uses SD cardCons:Does not have a rechargeable battery,Not very durable,Long shutter to picture gap,Low lens quality,Not a lot of optical zoom,Menu to change picture settings.All in all; for a FIRST camera it's pretty good.... but if you are trying to replace an old one go for something a little more up the market.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good editing software included!", "Author": "Julio C.

My experience is the complete opposite.I noticed a problem with the very first picture I took, and tried about 20 more with only a couple turning out halfway decent. I do not claim to be a professional photographer or even a good one, but I suspect this is due to the so-called \"digital-image stabilization\". While claimed as a feature, this is no excuse for the lack of an optical image stabilizer. The camera basically increases the ISO to compensate for movement, which leads to high distortion especially in indoor scenes. The images look okay when zoomed out, but once I zoom in all the way or view them on my computer, no one in their right mind could claim this was \"good picture quality\".In short: Do NOT buy if you need high resolution images.

I trusted Amazon's search. Amazon should get this info right, and the manufacturers should give clearer specs as to what the camera's features are, what's in the box, what type of batteries are used, etcetera.Pros: So far the camera is very easy to use, has very nice picture quality, is really tiny, uses AA batteries, easy to transfer pics to my computer (comes with cable).Cons: no optical viewfinder, feels kind of flimsy (especially the battery door...which is what broke on the my Fuji Finepix S700, essentially ruining the otherwise functioning camera). Definitely don't think the SL30 would recover from a drop on the floor, also a pretty long delay in flash for low light pics.Seems like a nice little camera for someone who doesn't know much about cameras and just wants to take some fun snapshots.
