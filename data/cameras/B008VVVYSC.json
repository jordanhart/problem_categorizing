A 16 Mega Pixel, 10x optical zoom, wide 28mm, 3.0 LCD, dual image stabilization camera for a little over $100 is a great deal. How bad can it be I asked? I wished the previous reviewer had written his or her comments prior to my purchase. Well, this camera is horrible. Every picture taken comes out blurry. Doesn't matter the setting. Not sure what the dual image stabilization is supposed to do but it doesn't help the image quality. Please note that I do not have any issues with hands shaking to even have a concern with taking a stable shot. So don't waste your money on this one. I am very disappointed with Fujifilm for making a horrible product.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Promises", "Author": "Upshifter", "ReviewID": "RCQUTG6ZDCL9O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I haven't found any new inexpensive cameras that take really clear pictures.  Yes, they have all kinds of features, but they don't often work well to get clear pictures.  Digital photography is my hobby, and I collect early digital cameras.  I have 4 newer cameras. The T410 is a solidly built camera with the same lens as the T190 and the T200.  Yet the screen is larger, and the body is made from a good plastic that looks like metal, unlike the other T-series cameras which really are metal.  All three have a good look and feel to them.I would expect newer digital cameras to take pictures as clear or better than the basic cameras of 8 or 10 years ago.  They don't!  I found that very disappointing, especially with the Nikon S3300.  All these cameras have image stabilization; where is it?  The images don't look too bad until you make them a little larger on the computer screen.  Then you see that they look out of focus a certain amount, and there are artifacts, blurry smeary places in the pictures.  I've tried setting them up with some of the settings, using the 2sec timer, and setting them on a table of other support.  They are still unsatisfactory as far as I'm concerned.  None of them take pictures as clear as the older cheap cameras from 6 to 8 years ago.  For instance, I took a 4 megapixel Kodak DX4900 that I paid 2.99 for at the Goodwill store.  It has 2x optical zoom, no movie capability, and uses an old type \"Compact Flash\" memory card.  Indoors or out, flash or no flash, the pictures are clearer than those newer cameras.  The pictures from the Nikon S3300 were so bad that I sent the camera to the Nikon repair facility; it came back the same as it left, blurry. I took it back to the store and got my money back.The T410 looks good, feels good, and takes acceptable pictures if you're careful and hold it steady. I like the big screen, the nice controls, and the low price.  I don't feel that the pictures are clear enough, although much better than the Nikon. The T410 has an internal battery charger which is powered by a USB port.  The other T-series cameras come with an external battery charger; but they all use the same battery.  The battery is very small, but it is tough and holds a charge much better than the old cameras with the AA batteries.  Many of the older cameras have an optical viewfinder easy to use and easy to hold steady; the newer cameras like the T410 are difficult to see in sunlight, and are awkward to use at arms length, yet the T410 is thin and easy to carry.  I am disappointed when a new camera can't equal an old cheap camera in picture quality.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Blurry pictures even with a tripod.", "Author": "James Paul", "ReviewID": "RBW5JQNPGQ57S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from Walmart because I left my Canon A560 in a friends vehicle who was out of town, and needed to get some pictures of a day out on our snow mobiles.  The price was right at $89.99 so I figured what the hell?  I got back to my house and took a couple of quick shots and noticed that even when standing and holding the camera very still, it took a blurry picture.  Remembering that I had my tripod in my vehicle, I tested it out and found that it still took a blurry picture when zoomed.  The video quality has a lot to be desired as well, which is odd since it supposedly takes HD video.  I do like all the settings, and it does take decent pictures without using the zoom function, but all in all, it is still a Fujifilm product which to me isn't the best of products out there.  For a cheap, yet functional camera that takes decent pictures for a point and shoot, I would totally recommend the A560 by Canon.  I've had it since 2008, have dropped it a few times and it still works flawlessly, albeit maybe a tad bit slower.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Robby 818", "ReviewID": "R855KHL5WQJP7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice Camera Crisp Pictures I Have Enjoyed This Camera Since Day 1 Unlike Other Cameras This One Has A Re-Chargeable Battery So It's Ready To Go Straight Outta The Box No Need To Buy Expensive Batteries.

I took it on vacation and tried it out for the first time.  Panoramic shots, a good zoom, and the video recording was nice as well.  I also find it neat that when I took a picture of my wip cross stitch it picked up the half finished face.  Though in the wrong light it looks a little too bright.  Didn't notice any blurring.  Of course than I lost the cord that charges it and need to get a new one. So one star down for a replacement cord and four stars for the features that I needed.  It was this or an Olympic and I know I went with the good one.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not *that* bad", "Author": "Larry Peterson", "ReviewID": "RD8EZ85Y8115T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Come on, I don't know if I have a more positive attitude that others here but I got this for around $60 from walmart and I couldn't be happier.
