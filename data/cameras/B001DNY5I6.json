It also turns on/off rapidly. From other reviews I have read, people have said that they have problems with the touch screen. I disagree. My touchscreen is sensitive and in the 2 months that I have had it, I havn't had a single problem. The picture quality is excellent along with the video setting. So far, I havn't had any problems at all. Nikon has made a great camera that anyone can enjoy.", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera and it was delivered on time.", "Author": "Greg Brasher", "ReviewID": "R25E0EJQA4A3BN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera. I purchased it for my wifes birthday. It takes clear pics and is easy to use. we had a couple walking by take a pic of us at night in front with xmas lights and it came out perfect. we blow it up to 12 x 16. This one is a winner. When a pic is difficult to capture go straight to the scene screen and is easy to change to make that perfect pic. we are happy..good luck on your selection.", "Date": "January 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cool for teens", "Author": "Maureen R.

Cox \"Jenn\"", "ReviewID": "R3OFPINOJTOZXG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Within 15 minutes of playing with this camera for the first time, I was ready to send it back. I'm not a professional, but I know a bad picture when I take one. After messing around with ISO settings, white balance, scenes, etc...  the pictures still looked grainy. I primarily take indoor photos and the camera can't cut it.It is kind of cute; it's a bit bulky feeling for a slim digital camera and not heavy enough in my opinion. The pink color is prettier on the computer... lol it's uglier in person. Turns on and off quickly; takes about 3-5 seconds to take a picture.I absolutely HATE the touch screen and I'll never get a touch screen camera again !! The stylus is too tiny for my hands and I'm not crazy about having finger smudges all over the place.I also have sadly realized that buying a camera over the computer unless you are absolutely positive it's the one you want IS A VERY BAD IDEA !!  If you end up not liking the camera and want to send it back, you lose some of your hard earned money because of restocking.", "Date": "November 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ok camera", "Author": "John A.

I wish it were faster on the focus - there is a pretty good delay between pushing the botton and the picture actually taking, which for me is frustrating because I bought it to take photos of puppies - and by the time the camera takes the picture, the puppy has long moved.

I have no complaints about it. I love everything about it. It's easy to travel with and it hasn't died on me yet. The picture quality is amazing. I took it to a concert and I was amazed how well most of the pictures turned out. I've taken at least 5000 pictures with it so far. It has slowed down on me a few times and froze up but my brother told me it was because I had too many pictures on it. I deleted some of them and it went back to normal. I highly recommend this camera. :]", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not worth your hard earned money!", "Author": "cybermama", "ReviewID": "R2WE4TYZKOY5OI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for 8 months.  I read the instruction manual and educated myself on this camera before using it.  In the first month of owning it it went in to Nikon to be serviced because the \"wonderful\" touch screen kept locking up & without the touch screen working properly, you have no camera to use!  Servicing the camera was a pain and Nikon customer service was not very helpful, Nikon had the camera for 2 months out of the 8 months I have owned it.  Once I got it back, it seems the picture quality is even worse than before it went in.  Nikon cannot answer why this is happening.  I have a crappy camera and I'm out a good chunk of money for it :(  I have to be perfectly frank, the picture quality of this Nikon s60 camera sucks.  Pictures are blurred majority of the time, the shutter time is a lot slower than the manufacturer states.  I am so frustrated with this camera and all the problems I have had, so my best advice to you is purchase anything but the Nikon.  Do your home work, read the reviews and make your best decision on what will work best for you.  If you want to deal with blurred pictures consistently, slow shutter time, a touch screen that works when it wants to and poor customer service this is the camera for you.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "cool technology", "Author": "D.

The screen only worked for about an hour before it turned green. We are in the process of exchanging it or getting it fixed. There is nothing worse than giving a defective gift. Stay away from Amazon. It is too much trouble to return or get something fixed. Buy your stuff from a store that has lots of warranty for their products and with an easier exchange process.
