{"Reviews": [{"Title": "fun camera, wonderful pics, an EXCELLENT point and shoot... love it. just bought a second!", "Author": "Pete Henry", "ReviewID": "R21TUMBRCUWL2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i LOVE this camera.  it is small, versatile, very easy to use, innovative (the front lcd screen which shows you the live shot, just like the back screen, is a brilliant idea for self portraits and group shots.... just brilliant), and takes simply EXCELLENT amazingly crisp and sharp pictures.  my other point and shoot was a sony with a carl zeiss lens -- now you know those are good lenses, but this samsung beats it hands down.best best feature of this is the front lcd screen which lets you see the picture, just as if you were looking at the back lcd.  so so innovative, so smart, and once you use it you wonder why all cameras don't have this amazing useful bit.picture quality is superb.  even on email mode, this picks up details that my sony had never seen and i couldn't believe it.  seriously... a sony with a zeiss lens you would think is perfect!... but this is better.  very very very happy with this purchase and i simply love this camera.  i bought it in time to go to a wedding, and all the guests were awed with the front lcd also saying, oh my gosh i have to get one of those..... !!! and actually for one relative i hadn't seen in a while at the wedding, she was so in love with the cam to take family shots, i bought her one on the spot as a surprise, from amazon too!my few pet peeves..... 1) this is a great camera, can you at least somehow make it look a little sexier?!!!  it looks like any other camera on the market, but i think is much much better.  basic black is SO SO boring.  i didn't realize it comes in silver!  but some other inventive colors would be nice too... also it seems to be VERY hard to get it in a color here in the u.s., tho i did find some on ebay after i had bought it on amazon.... dayam!!!).  2) battery life seems to be VERY short - about an hour with some active shooting.  an hour shooting at a wedding or family event is NOT a lot of time!  i have since bought backup batteries, and carry them.  3) this has a wonderful lcd on the front, which it says you can turn on by tapping.  but no -- you must paw and pound at the front lcd for it to turn on.  you have to paw at the front lcd to hard to turn it on (if you don't use the actual \"front lcd button\" to turn it on) that i actually thought the camera was broken.  4) though it has a touch-screen lcd on back, it never responds particularly accurate to my finger swipes even though i did calibration, it works much better with the stylus.  when you \"whoosh\" the screen to go to the next screen, it ie goes too fast and goes all the way to the last screen.  even if i whoosh it slowly just trying to move a screen ahead.  then i have to whoosh oh so slowly and carefully back. 5) some of the menus, since they have several screens of options, need to have an indicator that shows there are more screens with options, like the sidebar on a window when you're on a computer that lets you know you can keep scrolling down.but still, right now i wouldn't trade this camera for any other point and shoot on the market.  it is great and i love it..... seriously, you will too.  ;-)**************October 2011 UPDATE....ok, now that i've had this camera a few months i can still say, I LOVE IT!  BUY IT!  ONE OF THE BEST POINT AND SHOOT CAMERAS OUT THERE.......!plus seriously, EVERYONE who sees the front LCD loves it and says omg i must get that!camera still works fine.  i am a little less careful with it than when i first bought it and it was nice and pristine and shiny.  it gets knocked around a bit in my messenger bag, and it does turn on by accident b/c the \"on\" button gets hit.  but it is taking a licking and keeps on ticking.......my only TWO complaints now that i've had it a few months......1) it takes a LONG TIME to get ready for the next shot.  like i think 4 seconds almost?!  when you are trying to shoot at an event, you probably will loose the shot!  of course, the reset is b/c it has to write the info to disk, battery must recharge flash... but seriously.  this is about the slowest point and shoot i've ever used.2) the \"kid shot\" function shows a little cartoon to get an inattentive baby's attention.  BRILLIANT IDEA BUT...... it actually makes the kid look the wrong way in your photo, unless he or she is cross eyed!  OH WELL!  at least they are smiling........still, this is a BRILLIANT camera and i love it.  it is still right now the only point and shoot i'd buy.  oh actually another improvement they could make is to wifi it.  samsung does make wifi cameras, so you can transfer pics without cables and cards.  but this one isn't one of them.  next generation maybe?..... hopefully?.......but seriously.  you'll be very very happy with this.  i love this camera.  pretty sure you will too.  unless you're you know uptight and grouchy.... or something like that......", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just a great camera and I take it with me wherever I go", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "R1VKJBJEHKHZDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was planning to purchase a new camera back in December 2010 but did a lot of research and at one point I almost purchased the Samsung ST600 but was going to wait until we received our tax refund.  I continued my research just in case something new came out and sure enough the ST700 was introduced.  I waited until it was available and did some shopping around and found it for $221.00 which I thought was a great price.  I have been using it but it has so many features that it is going to take a while to get through them all.  The size is just great for all the stuff it has on it and friends are amazed at the quality f the photos and so am I.  I also like the interface with my computer using the cable or pulling the card out to insert into the computer.  I live in a wooded area and so we have all sorts of animals since we all left our back yards natural and the deer and other animals are there to take live videos and post them on Facebook.  I hope t a lot of enjoyment from the camera.  I think it was a great buy.Ron", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "B. Sebastian", "ReviewID": "R3P0ZY8592Y03V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product is visually beautiful for a camera and for a point and shoot it has A LOT of features. I really liked the wide arrange of photo and video options you can choose some with a lot of stunning effects and picture quality.There is only a few things i wish could have changed with the product.1. I wish the touchscreen was a little more sensitive. (Overall it isn't THAT bad, but its manageable)2. Be careful not to get any hard dust or debris in the lense because it WILL refuse to close if it gets to clogged up. This camera is definitely not a rugged all terrain camera, but a delicate camera to be carried in a hard shell camera case.3. The front LCD could be a little bit more accurate with what the final picture would look like. I kinda wished the LCD in the front would display the final look of the picture from looking from the back as well.Summary: Other than being an outstanding point and shoot camera with a ton of great features and beautiful stunning pictures, the construction quality of the possible lens malfunction, front LCD inaccuracy, and touchscreen in-sensitivity makes my rating not a full five stars. BUT! The picture quality and its great user friendliness definitely makes up for it and it being a dual screen LCD camera makes it great, innovative, and fun.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Horrible. Returned it right away and regret purchasing in the first place.", "Author": "betweenthepages", "ReviewID": "R2UU2R19V2RASI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was so excited for this camera. After doing a lot of research and price comparisons I thought I'd found the perfect camera for me--something that I could take self-portraits with with friends and family, but that could also work for scenic photography as well. Boy, was I WRONG. As soon as it arrived I regretted buying this horrible device. Let me make a list to simply the strikes against it:1) The touch screen is IMPOSSIBLE to use. This comes from someone who has an iPhone, tablet, and multiple other touch-screen devices in her home. It is very inconsistent and does not do what you want to it to, ever. You have to try and re-try multiple times to simply move from one picture to the other or to delete a single photo.2) It is SLOW. And I mean, noticeably awkward and stone-age slow. It seems like a full minute (probably more realistically about 15-30 seconds) for the flash to come after you press the button to take a picture. This means not only do you totally miss the moment you're trying to capture, but when trying to take a picture with a friend you stand there smiling like an idiot for about 20 seconds. This is probably the feature of the camera that makes it not only inconvenient but unusable. What's the point in a digital camera if you might as well be using a daguerrotype?3) NO forced flash on. The only option is \"auto flash\" which is NOT acceptable when taking photos outdoors or in dark conditions. It ruined many a photo before I had the sense to return the camera.4) Very loud and noisy. The volume probably could've been turned down but the camera did NOT have a user-friendly interface, and so I could not for the life of me figure out how to shut it up, even though, as I said, I am usually quite tech-savvy.5) The front-LCD screen is horrible quality. This was the main reason I purchased this camera and yet the image was so blurry it was practically useless. Images were fuzzy and the screen was always dark, so you couldn't really even tell what you'd look like in the picture.Those are the bulk of my complaints, but, as you can see, that was QUITE enough to make me send it back disgustedly. This was a wonderful concept for a camera, and I admire the idea behind it greatly, but the execution is just far too poor to make it worth any sort of money, much less the high amount they ask for it. I returned this camera for a refund (thank goodness) and went back to buy a replacement for my old Lumix that had served me so well for 4 years. And I'm very glad I didn't wait too long to do so.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware..there are cheats out there", "Author": "SM", "ReviewID": "RT4EDOSZQYRR4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Iam writing this review to caution everyone about this seller..I got carried away by the ratings for this seller and  regret buying from them.A damaged item was shipped to me and now there are excuses to take it back and at different times they change their stand.I had shipped this out of US and at first a return label was generated and upon relaizing it is outside US they got bold ..must have thought that I will not be able to take any actions..Return shipping is like more than 30usd which seller wants me to pay and there is no offer to compensate atleast some % of the cost..it is like penalizing me for buying from themAlso the ratings seems manipulated and iam 200% sure that this cannot be genuine ratings shown there..probably amazon should do an audit to find out whether the ratings are the work of an insider.I had bought this camera and the package arrived on time and there was no damage to the package..upon switching on the camera it was noticed that the front LCD ,which was the main feature,is not working..rather u can see a crack.This was a refurbished product and have learned a lesson...if u pay peanuts(it was 90 usd ) u will get a monkey..tks", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung ST700", "Author": "james2", "ReviewID": "R1E8B9FZW3CM2J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received my new Samsung ST700 yesterday.

Todd Miller", "ReviewID": "R2LR5D3E4WKOFV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned my Samsung TL700 for about five months.  I've been quite happy with the picture quality in bright light or sunlight; indoors or dim light yields just an \"OK\" picture, without making manual adjustments to the settings.  The camera functions are intuitive, smart phone-like, which I appreciate.  During my two phone calls to customer support, I've received good, efficient responses to my questions/concerns.The biggest issue with this camera is battery life.  Should you store this camera for more or a day or two, the battery will become completely drained.  Customer support stated this was a \"malfunctioning battery,\" and sent me a new battery.  However, I have the same issue with the replacement battery.  I thought, perhaps the case is pressing on the camera, causing it to power up; however, the battery still drains with the camera sitting on a shelf without the case.  This is more of an annoyance than anything; I simply recharge the camera the night before I know I am going to use it.Other than the battery issue, I have no complaints about the camera:  easy to use, light to carry, small enough to fit in my pocket, good photos (especially outdoor pictures).Update (12/24/2012):  The problem with battery drainage was never solved, even with a \"repair\" at the service center (at my expense to ship).  The touchscreen became progressively more difficult to use, seemingly insensitive to the touch.  I am very gentle with my cameras, but the build quality proved to be less-than-stellar over the long haul, with problems developing in the lens mechanism.  Alas, at my dear friend's wedding, the camera stopped working altogether, giving me a blank screen with an error message advising me to contact the service center.  I don't expect electronic products to last forever, but a $200 camera should have more than 18 months (and about 600 shots) worth of life in it.  It's a pity, as the photo quality was usually stellar for a point-and-shoot.I am a bit of a Samsung fanboy:  I own Samsung TVs, Samsung DVD players, a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone, and a Samsung laptop.  This camera has been my only bad experience with a Samsung product. However, given my disappointment with Samsung's camera, I replaced it with a Canon SX160.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super Deal!", "Author": "Gerardo E Escalante Z", "ReviewID": "R1M5H5MPQRFT5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi guys!I bought this Samsung ST700 refurbished for like $70 including shipping... and its awesome!The camera looks and work like brand new. It came super well packed (not in the original box)and just a battery charge away to start using it.I have been reading some of the negative reviews for this camera and it turns out to be from people that just didn't read the instruction. (available for downloading at Samsung's website).  The touch screen is firm and precise and with a very user friendly and intuitive menus layouts. The smart modes for pictures and video are foolproof! just point and shoot.What came in the box? (comparing to the factory new camera)-Camera.-USB Cable and AC adapter.-Battery.What didn't came in the box?-Strap,-Touch pen,-Cleaner,-User manual CD-ROM,-Quick start manual.I was expecting this because on the seller description for \"refurbished\" items, they warn about some minor accessories may be missing. So no problem there.It was a super good deal. The seller (tech for Less) deliver it extremely fast and in unbeatable conditions, but they didn't answer any of my emails.Overall experience: EXCELLENT.>>UPDATE<<In case you are going to be shooting continues video, the battery is going to die on you in about 30 to 40 minutes.

The front LCD can be turned off when not using it, so battery will last longer that way.One final advice: BUY A MEMORY CARD!!!

It was supposed to be the latest and greatest in the market with dual view technology. With just a few pictures taken, not even a week after having received it, the camera stopped working. The battery wouldn't charge, the camera would not turn on, and if it turned on it would froze up and get stuck with the lens out. Probably it was just bad luck that I got a deffective product and it is not a reflect of the product as overall, but I will never know unless I had another one to compare. I contacted the customer service and they didn't have a replacement camera so I'm returning the item and requesting a refund.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Far price", "Author": "Joey.ro20", "ReviewID": "RFIOL47GUY6RQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Battery lifes great two screens ones touch some great features hdmi capable my gf dif enjoyed it for christmas.

Firstly, the construction of this camera is poor and cheap. It feels like it will break with just one drop! The picture quality is just unacceptable, no matter what mode I put it in and regardless of the 16 MP. Having the camera zoomed in made the quality worse. The touch screen is impossible to work with and not nearly sensitive enough! Of coarse, it's decent when you use the stylus but really... who on earth is going to use a stylus for a camera? I am not one of those people! The front LCD screen is a great idea, but you cannot just \"tap it\" to turn it on, I had to practically hit it for it to respond! The flash makes all faces look washed out and gives off a Very poor color! I even tried taking some pictures outside in hopes that it would do some justice there but no, the picture quality is just as terrible and does not take pictures nearly fast enough for me. I went through Every setting possible and sure, some of the features are cool. But overall this camera is by far one of the worst point and shoot cameras I've ever used!
