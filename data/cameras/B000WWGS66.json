Richter \"Seeker's Quest\"", "ReviewID": "R2NTEGXG3QKK3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This order arrived sooner than expected & just in time as well, I've been needing a camera to see the Animal life around my home & this one was perfect, Well almost so, Everything worked just fine, Except for the Wiring, Now don't get me wrong, Everything Worked!, But I found that I needed a Heavier Wire to Hold up to the weight of the local Wildlife. But after running  the wire leads inside a piece of Conduit pipe, all problems were solved.The Camera itself works just fine & was easy to set to focus  7 color settings with my Switch Box. Someday soon, I hope to obtain a good HDD Recorder so I can show pictures with these fine cameras.I get over a 50 ft view at night with the camera setting at 7 Foot off the Ground. And after I install some extra IR Yard Lights I ordered, I expect to be seeing my whole area as good at Night as I do during the Day.I'd like to add, for the First time buyers out there. Don't be fooled by the price, $22 or $25.00 is a Bargain for these cameras, I've worked with some that had price tags for over $500.00 each & they didn't work half as good as these cameras have been working. and don't let their small size fool you , In my case, Smaller is better!Another thing, Shipping can cause Vibration inside of the Box, That can loosen all screws, ( It happens to a NEW CAR all the time) The same is true for a Camera, So make sure all screws are Tight, But Do Not Over-tighten ore you could Strip the threads. If you find any gaps in the Covering, A Very Thin Film of Silicon Sealer can be applied, forming a water tight gasket around the Camera housing seams, if any.One last bit of advice, Know your leads, if you get a camera for a monitor that has RCA leads, You need RCA leads or A Lead Converter to plug in the camera. Now most of these cameras come with the proper adapters for both \" RCA or BNC \" connections, Also Check your connections for Tightness, a Poorly connected cable will enterfer with the Picture you get on your monitor(s).One last thing, Watch those Temps. If it is in The Afternoon Sun, the Camera could become overheated or just burn out, This is true for ALL Cameras both Cheap & Expensive, Turning them off, when not needed, or setting them up with an added Motion censer Would solve that problem.Well that is about it, Enjoy your Cameras, They are a Blast watching Wildlife in action & Not just for Security, Buy a bunch, While they are still low priced.Thanks AmazonA.j.Richter", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$184.95", "Features": "35 degree viewing angle. 850nm Infra-Red Wave length\nBuild-in 6mm lens and 24 infrared IR LEDs.
