{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Panasonic leads the point-and-shoot category", "Author": "Analyst 1951 \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R2AKPXIV8HLAUJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic makes the best compact superzoom cameras!  Here's why.  I was a professional photographer for over twenty years and recently sold all my professional film cameras (35mm, 21/4\"x 23/4\" and 4\" x 5\").  I've been searching for a compact superzoom camera that I can keep with me at all times to catch those once-in-a-lifetime shots without the expense or weight of a Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera.  Keep in mind that a compact superzoom has a smaller imaging sensor and will never truly compete with a high quality DSLR but if you want the best camera available in the compact point-and-shoot category then Panasonic DMC-Z series of cameras wins hands down.  I've conducted an exhaustive search of camera review sites and have found Panasonic to consistently meet my standards of excellence.  You don't have to take my words for it, you can check out my claims for yourself at the digitalcamerareview and dpreview web sites.OPTICS:The heart of any camera is the lens.  Nothing else in photography counts without good optics.  Panasonic uses Leica DC Vario-Elmar lenses in many of their cameras.  Amongst professional photographers Leica has a reputation for quality akin to Rolls Royce.  Leica appears to have maintained their reputation in Panasonic cameras by avoiding significant optical flaws.  Most superzoom camera optics suffer from multiple flaws.  Two optical flaws that I find completely unacceptable are chromatic aberration and uneven or soft focus.You'll see chromatic aberration as a color fringe (red on one edge and blue or green on the opposite edge) along the edge of an object.  It's often most visible near the corner of the image and along the edges of high contrast subjects like a dark car in front of a bright building.  Sometimes chromatic aberration is so bad that it can be see in the center of a 4\" x 6\" photo but it's most often only visible when enlarged to full screen on a 17\" or larger monitor.  In my opinion, when it comes to chromatic aberration, Panasonic consistently out performs all competitors including Nikon, Canon, Olympus and Sony.  I strongly suggest you see this for yourself by looking at web reviews that have full resolution images.  Click on the full resolution image, zoom in and scroll from corner to corner and you'll see what I mean.The second major optical concern is focus.  Some camera lenses are sharp in the center of the photo but go slightly out of focus towards the edge of the photo.  This usually isn't a problem if you are only going to use your multi-hundred dollar camera to make 4\" x 6\" prints but soft focus can be a huge disappointment when making larger prints or viewing the photo as a full screen image.  The Leica lenses on the Panasonic cameras appear to excel in the category of sharp focus.  Again, I suggest you see for yourself by zooming in on full resolution images available from some web review sites.Other optical concerns include barrel and pincushion, which describe how vertical and horizontal lines can be curved in the photograph even though they were straight in real life.  Some barreling or pincushioning is inherent to every zoom and are usually only noticeable at the widest angle or strongest telephoto settings.  This type of distortion can be so severe that it distracts the viewer from appreciating the subject of the photograph.  Leica does a superb job of minimizing barreling and pincushioning to the point that I find this type of distortion within acceptable limits.My final comment on the Panasonic DMC-Z series optics is that the wide-angle setting on the zoom lens is equivalent to a 25mm lens on a 35mm camera.  In my experience, the wide-angle lens is the most important feature of a zoom lens.  You can always crop an image to get the equivalent effect of a stronger telephoto (of course you'll lose some resolution) but there is no similar way to compensate for not having a wide enough lens.  Sure you can paste images together using a panoramic mode but you wind up with a long narrow picture that's difficult to put in a frame.  Plus, except for the latest top-of-the-line Sony, you can't paste a large group photo together because people will move between shots.SENSOR:If the heart of a digital camera is the lens then the soul is the imaging chip and the camera's internal image processing software.  Panasonic excels in this area too.  Again, I strongly suggest you see for yourself by zooming in on full resolution images available from some web review sites.  Every digital camera has software that is designed to minimize the noise introduced into the image by the sensor.  If noise reduction is too strong then details are lost and objects start to look like cartoon drawings.  If noise reduction is too weak then smooth areas like blue sky or concrete look unnatural because they're covered with dots.  Panasonic has managed to achieve a pleasing balance in this category.CONCLUSION:Finally, I'd like to mention that, for the most part, I don't care about what photo editing or cataloging software comes with a camera.  There's plenty of great software available from third party vendors and if the camera is not capable of producing a quality image then the accompanying software is absolutely useless to me.So the bottom line is that the Panasonic DMC-Z series has the best combination of lens & sensor/built-in image processing software of any of the point-and-shoot cameras and is the most capable of producing an image that can stand up to being enlarged.  Additionally, considering Costco has the Panasonic on sale this month along with their great return policy, I consider Panasonic a great buy.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buy it while you still can", "Author": "bill faulkner", "ReviewID": "RLTIAJDKWPZ55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like some obsessive compulsive reviewers I literally spent days pouring over that latest generation of digital equipment. My goal: to find the best all around performer that had the fewest compromises for typical family outings, including vacations. As background, I'm a former Nikon F 35 mm photographer, back in the day when high end photography was a real hobby. Not that it isn't today, but there are simply too many choices and not enough to base a decision on. Back then, if you had the money, you bought a Nikon F series.Goal: Excellent photos and videos. Good machine ergonomics. Pocketable.This seems to be the desire of many manufacturers but how many actually get there?None.How many get close?One. Panasonic.Their Lumix Z series especially with the decent Leica lenses take photos worthy of a pro. Make no mistake, these are not SLR quality, but they are close enough that when intertwined with the compromises, makes them the end of the rainbow, at least as far as I'm concerned.As for video, the HD video from this unit is excellent. Is the sound perfect? Nope. Is it in any of these cameras? None that I've seen. Does it matter? I've flipped and flopped between splitting the purchase between a flash memory video and a cheaper point and shoot.But for the average family photographer, why don't you want both in one? Why don't you want something in your hand all the time that lets you capture that Kodak Moment? Heck I take more stills and videos with my Iphone than with any camera these days just because . . .its there.On a planned vacation or outing, you want more detail. And the Lumix Z series comes through. Crisp photos. Sharp video. And adequate sound.On the sound, I almost passed on this camera because someone dissed it for the sound. A low level hum. After all, I'm a details kind of guy, so how could I live with that? Do you actually hear it?Yes, you hear it when you are zooming. No surprise here. The mic is integrated with the body so there is no way to isolate it. Is this a minor matter. I believe so. The key is that you will get decent stereo sound of your family and you will be listening to THEM and won't care if you hear a minor hum in the background. For reference, my 3 chip panasonic miniDV camcorder had a minor hum too. But everything else line up so well, I loved that camera.The key thing with the Lumix Z, is that the audio is crisp and you will get the shot.Windnoise is an issue with ALL video cameras and addressing it is fairly straightforward. After noticing this on my first outing, I came up with a cheap fix. I cut a square of paper towel and two strips of blue tape, loosely covering the mic. I experimented in medium wind and it suppressed the wind significantly. As you probably know, you can buy blue tape at any Home Depot or probably Staples. If this sounds like a pain, remember, that pro photographers go to a lot more trouble to get great shots, so consider this trivial.File size of this older model: An 8gb sd card will give you 8min in HD movie mode. Considering most of your shooting will average 30 sec, you've got 16 segments, before you offload to your laptop. How much usage time does the average home video camera in a year? Just 30 min. Some years more, some less.Should you buy the Z7 instead, with the fancy new AVCHD? Certainly you will get more recording time, but will you need it? What you may get is the hassle of dealing with a new codec to decompress those files, not something you bargained for. On hassles, I almost gave up and chose a Sony, only because it is so user-friendly. But the photos were class C, and Z's were Class A.By the way, steer clear of the cheaper FH series. It may have HD video, but side by side it with the Z series and you will see its not worth consideration.For those interested, my runner up is the Canon 780. But its form factor is too small and the lcd shrunken. Its actually not as comfortable to use. And the images are class B.Hope this helps!", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Giant Step Forward from the ZS3", "Author": "R. Doug \"R. Doug Wicker\u2014Author\"", "ReviewID": "R33Q67MKSTMROH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This, the latest in Panasonic's ZS-line of point-and-shoot cameras, is a huge improvement over the ZS3 I previously used (see review at: Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3 inch LCD (Black)), and addresses many of the admittedly minor issues I found with my original camera.Pros:The new ZS6 (and it's stablemates the lower end ZS5 and upper end ZS7) now allows complete exposure control.  The camera comes with Aperture-Priority, Shutter-Priority, and a Manual Mode that allows adjustment of both.  All three of these modes are accessed on the relocated Mode Dial and when in Manual Mode a light meter-type display is superimposed on the screen.Another big complaint I had was lack of in-camera control of picture adjustment parameters.  This has also been addressed, with complete user control over the big four -- Contrast, Sharpness, Saturation, and Noise Reduction.Same great 25mm-300mm Zoom (35mm equivalent) carried over from the previous ZS1/3 line.  This is quite simply the best compact travel zoom on the market in my opinion.Cons:Battery life is still a major issue, and SterlingTek's remarkable replacement battery (see my review at: SterlingTek's POWWER Panasonic DMW BCG10PP Digital Camera ID secured battery) with much longer life (which I purchased for my ZS3) will not work in the New ZS5/6/7 line.  SterlingTek advised me today that they are aware of the problem and are working on a fix.The ZS6 only allows for one My Scene selection on the main dial.  The ZS7 to my understanding retains two because it also retains the separate activation button for video mode whereas the ZS6 has a selection for that on the Mode Dial.Still no RAW capability.There is no hard-copy of the instruction manual; it's on the accompanying disc.  This is quite simply unacceptable for a camera with this many features and which requires extensive study of the manual to truly master.  And I shouldn't have to go to the expense of printing out 150+ pages to make up for this cost-cutting scheme.Best Deal:I purchased this camera a month ago at Costco, complete with belt-attach leather case and 2GB card, for just under $290.  Then just yesterday I went to Costco and got an additional $50 off because they came out with a coupon for this marvelous point-and-shoot.Conclusion:Highly recommended as a backup for your primary DSLR camera, or for when carrying a big, heavy DSLR is not practical.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "It well numbered!!", "Author": "lordhoot \"lordhoot\"", "ReviewID": "R34AQZOFERZ82D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Note: This is more like 4.5 stars. Panasonic DMC ZS6 is basically a compromise mixture of Panasonic ZS5 and ZS7. It more closer to the ZS5 although some features like 3 inch 460k LCD from ZS7 is there. It is mostly sold through Costco or in this case, Amazon.I brought this to replace my Panasonic TZ4 which had an unfortunate accident. I must say that as a casual shooter (not a high demanding professional), I found this camera superior to my old TZ4 in just about every single feature. If you are old Panasonic hand, you will be able to get into this camera almost instantly. If not, its still pretty easy camera to learn, they even got a short printed booklet for you. The detail stuff lies in their CD.The outside photos are quite excellent. Indoor photos are also quite good but I thought the flash was bit on the weak side and I was slightly unhappy that I could not find a flash compensation mode in this camera. My Canon point and shoot like SX120 got one, why not a Panasonic?? The camera was pretty easy to hold and control. It can handled all types of SD cards. It uses a lithium battery with pretty decent lifespan. I shot two videos and 300 photos and the there are still two bars left. I strongly recommend that you carry a spare anyway. The scene modes are pretty good. I tried out their \"Ai\" mode and it work pretty well. I would have test it out for a prolonged period of time before I can say one way or another. By that time, Panasonic could be out with their \"ZS1000\" or something.The video is HD but uses a MPEG mode. There is a certain limitation due to that. You can only use about 2 gig of memory space regardless of the size of your card. I am not really sure why but that is way Panasonic has it designed. But the video is pretty good and it will serves as a back up to my regular camcorder. In this area, I think Canon's point and shoot cameras got everyone beat.There is a definite improvement in their macro section. It far more clearer then any of the Panasonic I owned before (about ten counting this one). I love the Panasonic camera because of their extra optical zooms. The regular optical zoom is 12x, pretty impressive range at 12 meg mode. When you scale down to 8 meg, the zoom goes up to to 14.7x. When you scale down to 5 meg, the zoom goes up to 18.8x and I usually shoot my p/s camera at that scale. At 3 meg range, you can shoot up to 23.4x zoom, all optical of course. ZS6's 25mm wide angle is truly impressive. When you add the wide angle with the super zoom, you got a camera that is truly awesome in what it can do for you. You won't get this with any other brand name.Another thing worth mentioning is the autofocus and capture speed. Compared to my old TZ4 camera, this camera is like super fast. Even at 8 meg or 5 meg scale, I was able to focus and shoot and do it again over and over at a speed I thought totally impossible with my old TZ4. This is pretty impressive feature.So if you are looking for a great point and shoot camera that can take great photos, got good video and impressive range of zoom, this is it.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Darn Good Camera", "Author": "Jamazon", "ReviewID": "R17V625U9MYF28", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Selected the Lumix ZS6 after researching, and changing heart that was set on a Canon.  And Costco was selling it for $240, with case and 2gb memory.  Hurry, ends in June 2010.  So played with it a bit.  Like the HD video.  Records in MOV format.  Very nice, but not like DVD sharp, but still great.  Photos are excellent, like top 3, not THE best.It has manual features up the wazoo it appears.  But for a guy like me that doesn't tinker much at this point, the iA (intelligent auto) is amazing.  Just set it and forget it.  Don't need to worry about exposure, aperature, lighting, not even what scene mode as it picks that by itself as well.  Face finder is cool.  3\" LCD screen is amazing.  Zooming in video is wonderful, something my Sony couldn't do.  Feels solid.  Feels heavier than most it's size.Will be on vacation in July.  Will fill in more afterwards.UPDATE AFTER VACATION:Took the camera to Albuquerque, Pikes Peak, Oregon coast, Washington coast, Seattle, Vancouver.  I use iA mode, for the most part.  I think everyone elses comments are right on so, I won't duplicate comments.Here's what I found with iA mode, the red item on the dial.  It worked wonderfully mostly.  In the highest zoom, took clear, sharp photos, even though I felt a little unsteady.  Because it's wider angle lens, I have zoom in on subjects or objects far more often than cameras with a smaller angles.  Image stabilizer worked well.  Out of 1000+ photos, I had about 4 that were blurry.  This camera did what I want to do, just point and click.  For mountain scenes, it picked landscape setting automatically.  For faces, the Lumix selected portrait.  In dark areas, selects lower light settings.  For macros, it selects the macro setting.  For scenery way over there, selects infinity setting.  I don't do a thing.It's not perfect.  Here's a couple of annoyances.  In iA mode, there isn't a quick force flash on setting, only a force flash off.  In areas, like shadows or sun behind subject, it wasn't always smart enough to know to flash.  In fact, it flashed less than 50% of the time.  I wanted to force flash, but doesn't seem to be available in iA mode.  So I had to switch to \"P\" mode to force flash.  Also, when you want to do a macro, and the scene is a little busy, it has difficulty to focus on that one object you want clear.  Because I don't know the manual settings yet, there were a handful of macro shots I could not take, the iA mode couldn't focus on.Some reading about this camera said the sound is mono.  But it has left and right microphones.I just want non-blurry, decently lighted photos most of the time.  It takes care of that, that my previous Sony DSC-W5 couldn't do.By the way, I also bought this extra battery, I think 2, with car charger as well for about $35.  Works well.  Then at another website, bought an 8bg, class 10, memory card, brand AData, for $17.  That's what I used.  Worked very well.

I use a digital camera to store and view my pictures on the computer. I am not one to make prints so I can't comment in that area. I rated the photo quality as 4 stars just because I don't see an improvement in that department on the computer compared to my 6 year old Canon that died, but I might be impressed if I made prints and compared them.

In my experience, this type of camera is most frequently used indoors, taking photos at kids birthday parties, family events, etc.  But, the flash performance is TERRIBLE.  Expect about half the range you're used to getting with your present camera, and a lot of very grainy photos when you exceed that range.  I read others' comments about flash effectiveness, but decided I'd just use an external flash when needed.  But, there is no external flash connection, so you can't solve the problem that way.  The only option would be a flash that slaves off the internal flash optically.  For all other photos, the camera produces sharp focused results and is fairly simple to use.  Battery life hasn't been an issue yet, but I haven't used it for extended periods.  Another potential problem is the battery.  In their firmware update, Panasonic apparently added some code to prevent you from every using a non-Panasonic battery.  For other cameras, I've found the after-market batteries to be of higher capacity and about half the price of the manufacturer's batteries.

You know it has a Leica certified (if not Leica-built) lens.  You probably know that Leica and Zeiss make the best optics in the world.  You know it offers manual control when you need it.  I'm going to tell you my personal experience with it.I bought my zs6 immediately before going on vacation last summer (2011).  I picked the zs6 based on a careful review of the current crop of market offerings for point-and-shoots.  I also took along a full-frame DSLR and an APS-C DSLR, both current models. Both DSLRs were equipped with Zeiss zooms and other high-end zooms and primes.  I'm a very serious amateur photographer.  Since I mostly use my DSLRs around home, that trip was when I really used the zs6.  A minute ago, I was going back over the  1000-or-so pictures that I took on that trip.  I was blowing the images up to greater than 19x13 and comparing.  What I saw was this:  the little zs6 did an outstanding job.  I had lots of images worth printing on my 13x19 printer.  The resolution was sharp, and the colors were rich and vibrant.  I do a lot of tinkering in Photoshop CS5; I even use plug-ins for noise reduction, so I'm obviously picky.  The shots with the zs6 were more than good enough to print as-is.  I could easily pass them off as coming from a DSLR.  No I'm not going to say that I'm going to sell my other cameras, but I will say this:  If you're a serious photographer and you want no-apologies performance from a PnS that you can carry in your pocket, look no further.Update:  A year later, I'm still getting stellar performance.  I just carried the camera all over the Eastern Mediterranean along with a DSLR.  Once again, the little Panasonic came through.  Sharp images, excellent color, effective image stabilization, and never a problem.  This is a huge accomplishment, given the camera's size and wide zoom range.  I really appreciate the build quality too -- like a Swiss watch.  Lately, I've been tempted to buy either a Sony RX100 or a Lumix DMC-LX7 (the Sony will have better pixel resolution, but the Lumix will have MUCH better low-light capability due to lens as well as sensor differences).  Even though I'm generally a Sony person (I gave up on Nikon a long time ago), this little ZS6 may persuade me to stay with Panasonic in the point-and-shoot domain.  There is a healthy trend in point-and-shoots, which I attribute to the ever-improving cell phone cameras making low-end PnS offerings obsolete.Tim Naff", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great images, so-so ergonomics", "Author": "Michael J. Edelman", "ReviewID": "R1YUGCBXVL6LTK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by noting that I bought my DMC-ZS6 as a reconditioned unit from woot at a significant discount from new. As such, I'm inclined to be a bit more forgiving of some flaws.First things first: This camera produces excellent images, probably as good as you'll find in a point-and-shoot camera. The Leica optics are contrasty and sharp, and Panasonic's image engine produces excellent color and saturation. It's not quite as good as what I get from RAW images in my D80, but it's very, very, good. I also like the variety of manual control available. Most point-and-shoot cameras offer two flash options: Auto and off. Some let you turn red eye prevention on and off as well. The Lumix cameras offer several more modes, including always-on flash, which is very useful in evening up the lighting in bright sunlight and other difficult conditions. There are a whole host of exposure control options, including aperture preferred, shutter preferred, and full manual. And the list goes on.What I don't like: First, rather than the industry standard micro-USB connector, the Lumix line use a Panasonic connector that restricts you to their cables. Need a replacement? It'll cost. Next, Panasonic puts a chip in their batteries that prevents you from using aftermarket batteries. The justification is that they want to protect the cameras from damage from improper batteries, but given that Panasonic buys their batteries form the same suppliers that the clone makers do, that's difficult to believe. And then they have the nerve to charge $60 for a spare battery?Next: The ergonomics. I bought this to replace a smaller Canon Digital Elph from several years ago, and even though the Lumix is significantly larger than the Canon, it's a lot clumsier in use. It's very easy on the Lumix to accidentally cover all or part of the flash. You have to grip it very carefully. Still, at the reconditioned price, I'm happy enough with it.

One of my big beefs with digital photography is that you lose out at the wide end - I like to shoot landscapes with prominent foreground detail leading into the picture. This has the equivalent of a 25mm lens at the wide end, and goes all the way out to 300mm at the tele-end. Auto exposure tends to be bang-on. The panorama assist function in \"Scenes\" is great. You tell it which way you are panning, and it gives you a ghost image of the previous frame, so that you can align and overlap your panoramas even hand-held. Stitching them later in Photoshop Elements is a snap. Can't comment on the video - I've never used it.

With a big trip to the Med coming up I decided it was probably time for an upgrade.  In looking over what the market had to offer I finally decided to do a brand switch and chose this gem, albeit I was skeptical that anyone could do better than Canon in the small camera arena (price as well as performance/features swayed my decision).After having used the camera extensively, both indoors and out on my aforementioned trip, I am wowed to say the least, since from a casual user perspective it simply outperforms my old Canon in every way.  The camera is a tad larger than my old Canon, but that is because it has a larger and more capable lens (there are smaller Lumix cameras that are about the same size as my old Canon, but I couldn't resist the Leica lens being used on this one).  Moreover, Caselogic makes a very nice case that fits the camera like a glove, with a very secure belt loop that allows you to comfortably carry it on your belt, something I've come to prefer when traveling.Other reviewers have thoroughly reviewed the camera's capabilities so I won't weigh in on that score.  But I will note a few things that I found really impressive.  First the cameras has an intelligent auto setting that I found extremely helpful when I was operating in point and shoot mode ... it quite capably handles setting the camera for things like close ups vs long distance so you don't have to worry about making adjustments in trying to get a quick photo.  Second, unlike my Canon, a zoomed picture is clear enough that you can zoom in on the already zoomed image by a factor of 8 or so and still be crisp.  Third, the image stabilization is very impressive, with far fewer blurred shots than what I experienced with my old Canon.  To be fair, I'm quite sure the Canon folks have incorporated far better performance in their newer cameras, but they are also pricier and lack the kind of lens quality Panasonic is offering on this camera.Just like with cars, people tend to have brand loyalty, but after many, many years of enjoying cameras from Canon's lineup, I believe Panasonic has won me over.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Mind Blowing Quality!", "Author": "Michael S.

Stumbled across the Lumix ZS series and was taken by the Leica lens - arguably the best made optics at ANY price - and the 12x zoom ratio of same. Further found a refurbished example ( heck, it's going to be carried in a pocket while outdoors! ) on Amazon at an incredible price, and ordered same. What arrived was a camera with NO cosmetic flaws that shoots incredible pictures, properly exposed and sharp as the proverbial razor. To add to the features, this camera even has a manual mode ( amoung others ), for those of us who grew up shooting 35mm cameras for the last several decades. For what it is, it does extremely well; if I want to get very technical, I pull out the Canon 50D w/ 24-105 'L' lens, a combo that out resolves and outcosts just about everything in its class. However, it is not under any circumstances small or light, impeding its use in many cases. The Lumix ZS6 will go where the Canon 50D w/ 24-105 can not, thereby limiting the use of the latter altogether. Without a camera, there is no photograph; the Lumix ZS6 makes the best use of size and weight, allowing the picture to be taken by its very presence and quality. The latter two features alone justify its acquisition and use. The refurbished price makes it just that much sweeter. For my purposes and beyond, it rates a  solid '5' stars.

I previously owned a \"pro-sumer\" Fuji which I loved but it was a bit clunky (bulky) to keep at the ready and heavy to pack and haul around. Plus the technology (2002) was becoming dated. I bought this Lumix model about 18 months ago (Aug 2010) and was initially pleased. Drawback was mainly too many features and I was overwhelmed and confused by the menu. It did not help that there was no included manual and that I had to download a 180 page pdf for print out.Then there was the problem that it only takes jpg formats; there is not a raw or tiff format option so I needed to set up a workflow during import so that I could convert the images to an archive stable format.Today's exasperation has me searching for a replacement camera. This is the 3rd time in the last 4 months that it did not recognize the SD card. The first time I replaced it and gave the original SD card to my daughter. That original SD card still works flawlessly in her Kodak camera. The second time I fiddled with it a bit, gave up and saved my images to the Internal Memory. Then, magically, a few weeks later, it suddenly recognized the SD card again.This third time, after working fine all day, it suddenly went to Internal Memory Only on a capture. I knew it was nearly full (1.8 out of 2 GB on the SD card) so I hooked it up to my computer. To my surprise, only the 6 images captured to the Internal Memory showed up on my computer!Anxiously I fiddled with reinserting the SD card a few times and then decided to place the SD card into my Wii. Thankfully all the photos showed up. Next I put the SD card into my husband's computer (his has a card reader) and once again they showed up. He moved them over to a USB for me but when I re-inserted the SD card into the Lumix it decided to recognize the SD card again and all the photos displayed both on the camera LCD and through my computer's USB camera connection.I then went online and discovered quite a few posts in various forums describing this same behavior. The sporadic nature of the camera being unable to recognize or access the SD card is quite frustrating. The forum suggestions to blow compressed air inside the slot, clean the points with alcohol, try a new card and turn it on/off did not work for myself or the others.I want a camera that I can rely on to capture photos and it's not this model!

Love the camera can't say the same for the charging system. I have had several camera's all have had the same familiar charging system. Plug the charger into the phone and charge.  This camera has you remove the battery, then place it in a charger.  I know, I can buy another battery, however, I would have liked the ability to charge the battery while in the camera as an option, ie: a optional charger.  This just allows for the possibility of leaving the battery at home when you take the camera out for a shoot.  I also believe that the little locks and snaps will eventually fail as you constantly remove the battery.  God forbid they start doing this with cellphones!", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Deletes Pictures", "Author": "teerav", "ReviewID": "RF20NL0347CJT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is great, 12x optical zoom, wide angle lens, somewhat compact... etc.  The only problem is that it randomly deletes pictures.  I went to Auschwitz, the salt mines, all randomly deleted.  Snorkeling off the Phi Phi islands in Thailand, one hundred photos deleted.  Tried different memory cards with the same results.  Wish I would have gone with the Casio (my old camera).  Better battery life, faster, more compact, more reliable, etc.  I'm not a camera freak, just want one to capture a few memories and a few places.  Unless you have time to redo pics, get another camera!", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003NYRMGA"}}
