There was only problem that was not indicated in the item description:  this wireless transmission interferes with 900 mhz cordless phones.  There is NO interference with my wireless network or recently purchased DECT 6.0 cordless phones.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loss of signal", "Author": "TheGMan", "ReviewID": "R7FV7LHMXYLWG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I mounted camera on a pole 20' from house.  Initially I had the TV and receiver 25' inside the house.  The signal had to travel through a glass door and one interior wall.  Sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't.  I used a portable TV and tried different locations.  I moved the receiver to within 1' of the glass door.  It still lost signal more than it worked.This was the second camera.  I returned the first one because it had the same problem.  I thought maybe I had a defective camera.  The second one had exactly the same problem.  So, either the camera is very susceptible to interference or the range is far less than stated.  The camera was used in a rural residential house with no unusual interference sources.With the problems with the first camera, shipping times to and from the supplier my 30 days return had expired.I'm glad this item worked for some of you but I will never buy another Securityman product.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "love the price and the quality.", "Author": "Miss S", "ReviewID": "RO7YN9QZ460OU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this system for a year now and it hasn't failed me.

The camera is advertised as having 100 foot indoor/300 foot outdoor range, and that just isn't true. I could barely get a picture 30 feet, and it couldn't transmit across the room if I stood between the camera and the receiver! And the picture, even for a camera of this size, is very poor.
