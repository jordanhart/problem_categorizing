{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Point & Shoot Camera", "Author": "Richard Evans", "ReviewID": "RL37XPH9RWNJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was shopping for a new camera 1.5 years ago and I was ready to buy one of the new compact mirrorless models that lacked a viewfinder. Alas none of them offers an adequately large view from their small displays. Even 3\" isn't enough to accurately compose a scene. I ended up getting a compact Sony DSLT (the A37) as a compromise but it's still a large camera that you don't just put in your jacket pocket.The Samsung Galaxy camera offers the largest display of any camera (short of an uber expensive medium format camera) available. I look at it both as a pocket computer with excellent specs (1.6GHz Quad core processor/2GB RAM) and as a super zoom camera (23mm-483mm) with a really wonderful 4.8\" display.It's really a Galaxy s3/s4 (without the phone) and a Samsung WB850 camera combined. To buy an unlocked s3 and a WB850 you would be looking at something like $850 so for $450 this is a good deal.This new SGC2 has been improved in so many ways. Any laggyness has been resolved with 2gb of RAM and a 1.6GHz Exynos processor. The new 28 smart modes should cover just about any shooting scene.Also I would like to point out that if you are into shooting videos, the Galaxy Cameras are among the very few that allow you to use an external microphone (which goes in the headphone jack.) That's one of the features I really like about the Sony A37 as well. A proper microphone makes all the difference in producing high quality videos.With Android 4.3 Jellybean you have the full Android experience. The camera comes with a rather small amount of internal memory but thankfully you can add a micro SD card to expand the memory. I use the SanDisk Ultra 64GB and it works perfectly.You can see my review at [...]", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R6GVE3KAFUI9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't rave enough about this camera, and neither could other people on the trip to Africa I just took.  I played with some of the apps and uploaded a couple of photos to Dropbox before I left, and they worked fine.  I didn't buy it for that stuff though.  I was looking for a relatively small but powerful camera, and this fit the bill.  I didn't try to upload anything via wifi while away because signals were horrible where I was, and the size of the files too large.  Had to play around quite often to get a good night shot.  In the end, the \"auto\" seemed to work best for that.  My one and only complaint so far is that I can't figure out how to force it to flash for backlight shots, but hopefully that's just user error.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "He loves it!", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R31LJSE7TP3P99", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son is having a ball with this camera/tablet!

My biggest fear about loosing a camera is loosing all of the memories that are on the card so having the 50GB of dropbox room is awesome, I just connect to wifi and everything is backed up automatically.You give up some camera abilities to have such a cool camera but if you are just a hobby photographer and looking for a camera mostly for good candids and whatever else you will never notice a difference. The auto features nearly get you taking professional photos without any training. Also I really like the edit features that come with the camera or you can download whatever you want if you don't like what it comes with. That's the best part about this beast!", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "samsung galaxy 2 camera", "Author": "dave", "ReviewID": "R6NIKG1UD23G9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great cam, many functions that I'm still learning.

I am an avid Samsung Android user, so I am very familiar with lots of features on this camera. This camera offers lots of cool features, like voice activated triger to capture the photo, which amazes everyone! It is also great since you can upload your photos directly to facebook and your dropbox, and use apps to manipulate the photos to turn them into an amazing work of art.I love the 21X zoom! It is incredibly sharp and accurate and It focuses prety nicely.HOWEVER... The major problem I have been having with this camera is that as long as you are shooting photos outdoors in the daytime, your photos come out beautifully. But when it comes to shooting indoors or in low light, the camera falls flat! It cannot focus and most pictures come out completely blurry! thats regardless if you are using flash or not. Same goes for the video recording (which by the way has no flash!) It keeps going in and out of focus and you end up taking 20 photos and all are blurry and your mood is ruined!Also, in the 16:9 mode the edges of the photos are exteremely streched out of proportion so you can only use the center portion of the picture.I am returning this camera in the next few days. I will most likely have to spend around $1k to get a Nikon 5300 DSLR since I want a great picture qaulity with built-in wi-fi.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "EK-GC200", "Author": "Esteban Pena", "ReviewID": "R1M4IF5JO0X74W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an amazing camera, I loved all the functions taking pictures is great, but unfortunately I had to returned, when I take videos the autofocus fail, when zooming to get closer image or retire the image it loose completely the focus for seconds, is annoying, I loose very important videos causing that, I do not know if is software o camera problem, but is too much money for a camera that doe not  work properly taking video.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Amy Woods", "ReviewID": "R1WOZCCTJ2TJKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an apple girl, not android BUT I needed a camera with a great zoom and the ability to upload via wifi intrigued me.

The photo clarity, zoom, bright clear back display and size are great.  The only problem I have is that it is not compatible with Apple at all.  I was used to using my older Samsung WB250 with my iPhone/iPad.  The WB250 wirelessly transferred to my iphone and the camera's memory card could be read with a lightning to SD Card Camera Reader.  Don't expect either of these options to work with this camera.  After trying to sync the Galaxy 2 camera unsuccessfully  (even thought the camera displayed connected to my iPhone), Samsung customer service finally confirmed that they are not compatible.  The work around is using the apps on this camera while connected to wifi or a hotspot.  This camera is basically a tablet with a very good camera.  The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is that I prefer Apple and I wish I could use this camera as I did my older one.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Kathy jenkins", "ReviewID": "R3PD6P61LXPR1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "reviewed lots of cameras and decided on this one.
