We we very excited to have a printer dedicated to photos.  The camera and printer are very easy to use.  It is a point and shoot and has 3 settings for prints plus a video feature.  We have been using the auto setting for mostly indoor pics, sometime using the close up setting.  The pictures come out pale,fuzzy and sometime the dots can be seen.  I have never had this problem with my old Kodak 4900X that is only 4 mp.  This is very frustrating because I thought that the 8mp camera would be much sharper.  I printed out a photo from each camera on the same printer to compare them.  The color and sharpness on the photo taken with the old camera is much brighter and sharper with no shadows.  The photos taken on the new camera have dots, shadows, red tinges where there should not be any and overall poor quality - very disappointing.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Do not buy", "Author": "Colette Holbrook", "ReviewID": "R1GJEC7BMU2O60", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy this  because when you need  more ink you are forced to buy their paper with the cartridge.  You cannot  buy the cartridge without the paper they won't allow it and don't sell it that way  I know I tried.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Camera okay printer sucks", "Author": "C. Marshall", "ReviewID": "R42GV0I7WPIDT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in June to take with us on vacation.  The camera I was pleased with, it took great pictures and was easy to use.  The printer dock however I was not pleased with.  I set it up as the instructions stated, first thing paper jam, fixed the problem and the cartridge was ruined.  I bought another cartridge installed it and it too ripped after almost finishing one pictue.", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fine Camera", "Author": "James E. Henderson Jr.", "ReviewID": "RNZPD0PTXDFDV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have had many Kodak cameras in our extended family, so it was a natural for me to get one for myself. Read the reviews and decided that this is the one I wanted. Just the right size for easy carry. Simple to use and it works as advertised. I added a 2 gig memory card.One problem to note are some system crashes on my laptop that are associated with the software. I assume that it will be fixed in an update or I will dig in and find the problem. I won't blame Kodak because sometimes I just have too many things happening with my PC.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Tam", "ReviewID": "RKCCARIPYD2SE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera/printer combo for someone who is a casual photographer.  Simple to use and get quick prints from your camera without having to send them in to get photos from a store.  Bought five of them to give as gifts, and had to return one because the camera quit working.  Would still recommend for the price.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beware of the price!", "Author": "jpau00 \"jpau00\"", "ReviewID": "R2GSSU6BW1HZD7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Kodak list price for the easyshare c813 is $80.
