{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Hidden Surveillance Camera", "Author": "Kenneth Depree", "ReviewID": "R2OG9OMIXYXGJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this surveillance camera because I was sure I was being robbed by my once-a-week apartment cleaner and wanted to have proof before I took action. I looked for a camera that could be in plain sight, record only when there was motion and never be suspected of being a camera. My search led to the purchase of this camera and it is everything that I hoped for. The dimensions are only 3.75\"x2.5\"x1.25\" and as you can see from the photo, it does not look like anything to be concerned about if the intruder can see only the front side. A power cord comes with the camera so you can plug it in to any outlet or you can run it off 4 AA batteries. But with the life of the batteries said to be only about 6 hours it is best to use the power cord as much as you can. Also supplied is the cable to plug the camera into the TV so you can watch whatever has been recorded. You can record in 640x480 or 320x240 and there are 3 choices with respect to quality of the video. The memory is an SD card, either 2GB, 4GB or 8GB, depending on the model you choose. All 3 models are the same,except for the capacity of the SD card. The card is built in so cannot be replaced for one of larger capacity.I am looking forward to using the camera on the maid's next visit and seeing her face when she sees the show.Instructions come with the camera, but set up is simple. To record, plug in and attach the power cord or 4 AA batteries and turn the unit on. To play back, plug in the camera and use the yellow cord to connect the camera to the video jack on the back of the TV and then, if necessary, click the TV?Video button on the front of the TV or on the remote. This starts the show.When you first get the camera you must set time and date and indicate whether you want to record only when there is motion. So the first step is to follow the instructions given for the menu that is built in. Nothing complicated, just follow the steps in the instruction sheet.On the back of the camera is a switch where you can set the camera to record over what is on the SD card or you can set it to stop when the card is full. One of the options on the menu is to format the card, which removes everything so you can start fresh for the next surveillance.A mounting device comes with the camera if you wish to attach it to a wall.The supplier of this camera also has what is called EasyCAPture that lets you connect the camera to a computer, providing it is not Windows 7. This device works with XP but not Widows 7. Because I know somebody who has XP on the computer I bought this device in case I need to make a copy of the video of the theft in progress for the police.  Amazon sells the same thing for a lot less than I paid http://www.amazon.com/EasyCAP-DC60-Creator-Capture-High-quality/dp/B002H3BSCM/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1329525829&sr;=1-1  I have not used it yet, but am told this is the only one to put the video on a computer.  It is model No. DC60", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Complete hidden spy camera\nNothing else to buy\nRecord on motion detection\nPlay back on your TV", "Name": "The Guardian: Complete Hidden Home Security Camera 8gb", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31h6HVp-FnL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005DFNL2Q"}}
