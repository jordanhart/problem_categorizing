VideoSecu has been worthless, finally formally giving up by saying they won't support the software at all and we're on our own. Manuals are written in English by non-English-speaking writers and they are a nightmare. For instance, once you change settings in one area there is no option to save those settings. Hours later we accidentally figured out that they labelled the \"save settings\" button as \"setup\". The software and manuals are riddled with this crap.  Our advice is to find a company with a full support structure and a history of support. You'll be glad you did.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Home Security DVY", "Author": "car man", "ReviewID": "R3LI7RG3DUL1RU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had this unit for 1 year, I'm experiencing multiple network issues, I recently updated to windows 7, and a new cable modem, and since have not been able to connect from LAN, or WAN.

Its hard to keep up with them all. Setting it up to cameras is a no brainer but when it comes to programming and just plain using it its confusing. If you dont have a lot of time to learn the system it can be a pain.
