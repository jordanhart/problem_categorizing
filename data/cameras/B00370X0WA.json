I began with a 35mm film SLR - It was the best camera I have ever used, until now.  This camera (E600) has a lot of features, which are pretty standard for a DSLR in this price range; being used to a totally manual film camera, I was a bit intimidated at first, but after a half day of shooting, I figured out a lot without any trouble at allThe E600 is excellent - I have not a single negative comment to add.  The only possible issue I could see is the LCD screen - it's on a swivel connection.  This has both pro and con to it.  The pro is that the screen can be turned LCD side inward and this will protect the screen; the con is the fact that the swivel connection could, possibly, develop a loose electrical connection - only time and a lot of use will tell.  The solution to the con side is to leave the screen with the LCD side out and use a screen protection film - they can be had almost anywhere.While in the decision making mode, I have gone to various stores and held other similar priced cameras in my hands, both the Cannons and Nikons felt a little cheap - \"plasticy\" if you will.Hands down, this is a VERY nice camera outfit.Also, the seller had this at my door within 2 days of purchase - that is outstanding.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent quality and price", "Author": "Mischaia88", "ReviewID": "RUVJLK8OMQSZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've purchased E-600 on Adorama, through Amazon. Though it's refurbished, it really looks like new (and acts like new!). The only difference I've noticed is different package which has \"reconditioned\" tag. Overall, camera is very brisk, responsive, even in live view mode. Noise is of course an issue but that's not surprising 'cause E-600 has 4/3  sensor.I'd also like to mention that both lenses have their own caps and HOODS AS WELL. very comforting because I don't need to buy separate ones. One thing that worries me is plastic bayonet on lenses. Could be problematic after some time (hopefully - very long time!).", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus-E600 is a stripped down version for the E600", "Author": "Ankan De", "ReviewID": "R2XWWMCLMFP0JV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for someone starting DSLR photography. Its the 4/3 format and hence expect noise in low light conditions. But some of the colors this thing can produce is insane. Also the kit lenses with this rig is by far the best kit lenses I have come across. Great optics there. At $450 for the body and two lenses, this is the best bargain in terms of bang for your buck. Potentially it can yield some great result! This is basically the same camera as the E620 minus some of the software tweaks. Effects which can be easily obtained in post processing.Best bargain around as of now.", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus Cameras Never Again!", "Author": "cynthia batterman", "ReviewID": "R1P0EISTT9RFKS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Over the past 15 years I have purchased FOUR different Olympus cameras (2 being SLR versions) and two of the three needed service work within a few years of occasional use.  They have not lived up to the reliability that I was expecting.  With that being said I cannot believe that any of the newer versions would be any better as they just modify the electronics a little every year.  If you do plan an purchasing one of these cameras, strike that, any Olympus Camera first look at the Nikon and then factor in another one hundred fifty dollars for repairs.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Value", "Author": "Norman G.

A double exposure  * The back light buttons of the E-620 is a great idea, but it does use extra battery power.No need to spend extra money for a E-620.  This is a great value.The kit glass is cheap but takes OK photos.  I like the 40-150mm, It's plastic, but this makes it light weight.  The F5.6 is not a low light choice but, It Fits in my small camera bag.  To cool.The JPEG engine is impressive.  Dynamic range at ISO 200 impressive.  Great news if you your a JPEG shooter.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$895.00", "Features": "Three Art Filters: The three in-camera Art Filters allow you to replicate dramatic effects\nAutoFocus Live View\nAF System: Super sensitive seven-point Twin\nThe powerful 12.3-megapixel Live-MOS sensor\nIn-Body Image Stabilization", "Name": "Olympus E-600 Digital SLR Camera, with 14mm - 42mm f3.5-5.6 & ED 40 -150mm f4.0-5.6 Zuiko Digital Zoom Lenses - Refurbished By Olympus U.S.A", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VXZD9MvXL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00370X0WA"}}
