Picture quality marginal at best.  After searching forever for somewhere to get support, found out this is a knockoff of another product.  Trying to update the software bricked the camera, but I was warned that this may happen.  I was happy to toss it in the trash, but sad I spent the money on it.", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ripoff of Foscam FI8908W (stay away unless tech savvy)", "Author": "Wesley Hunt \"Wes\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y6OTTGOMVICC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera was a rip-off of actual Foscam FI8908W. See [...].Box was obviously opened, and wire ties were off. Contents didn't exactly match packaging. Since it was a ripoff of a Foscam camera, you can't get support from it. However, with a lot of tinkering, it does work as advertised (thanks to all the manuals linked to from the site above).It will work with iPhone using CGI protocol outlined in site links above (look for IPCam CGI SDK 1.7 link). Also works with eyeCam iPhone app using Foscam PTZ settings.Audio quality is horrible. mic picks up only loudest sounds. internal speaker is very poor. Audio jack on back is a farce, and is just a hole drilled in the back to nothing!Stay away unless you really know what you are doing with setup.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Thank god I didn't pay attention to the other reviews", "Author": "Auggie", "ReviewID": "R3MX55Y676BGND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera thinking that I might be making a mistake after reading the reviews. What a surprise when I got it working and realized it was the best one I have tried after trying four different ones even some that were close to $200.00.1) The infrared light works great unlike other cameras I bought and had to return.2) Very smooth pan and tilt with movement while you press the button. Not \"STEPPED\" as other ones I tried.3) There are two iPhone apps for this camera that are very advanced. The two I bought are Surveillance PRO and Net Cam 4. Any Foscam compatible app will work. I think this camera is made by the same company in China that makes the Foscam but at a much lower price.4) Presets are awesome. I use it to check three things inside a room and I just need to select the preset and the camera moves precisely to the preset location.5) I'm using multiple cameras using different ports like port 80 for the 1st, port 81 for the second and so forth. The iPhone apps can show four cameras simultaneously in the same screen.6) It has speakers. You can talk through the camera and listen via the built-in microphone but listening and talking work only when you use an Internet Explorer Browser and you install their active-x that comes in their CD.7) When you move it it absolutely quiet and smooth.8) The built in web server allows you to check it using only a web browser from anywhere. It even works with the plain browser form the iPhone.9) This is one of the best features I like. If the IP in your router changes it will email you what the new IP is and you can change it in your app and get connected again.10) you can record live using the web browser and also take snapshots.11) You can set motion alarms and start automatic recording when it's triggered. (THere is an annoying red button that keeps beeping when you're setting it up. It's the default recording mode when motion alarm is set. Set it to off if you don't want it to record while you're setting it up)***UPDATE***12) If you get the Livecams Pro app you can listen to the audio coming for the camera's microphone and you can also turn on the app's talk button and talk through your iPhone and the camera speakers will play what you said via the iPhone or iPad mic.Use the included Active-X in the CD. If you use IE browser installation and settings it's very easy otherwise it's difficult.Just follow the instructions step by step. It took me about a half hour to get it working right. I made several mistakes and retraced back to correct them and got it working nicely.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Day blind.", "Author": "Darryl P.
