{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WX5 vs. S95 vs. P300 vs. LX5", "Author": "Eric J. Svancara", "ReviewID": "R4L6P8Q9RC7C8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an armature photographer who's goal is to capture moments in my life as well as those around me.  I hate using flash photography as I want to capture images/video the exact way that it originally appeared to me.  For most occasions I use a Canon 20D with a Canon 1.8 50mm prime lens.  This setup allows me to capture \"moments\" in low light, with no flash.  However, at time has gone on I have found it rather unrealistic to carry a DSLR with me at all times for various reasons, also I wanted to be able to capture video as well.  I did not want to have to carry a separate device in order to capture video as well.  So, the next logical conclusion was to look for a point and shoot camera that would perform in low light situations as well as record high quality video as well.In no particular order I am reviewing all the P&S; cameras that I reviewed in their comparable classes.  The requirements were 1) To be easily pocketable 2)high performance in low light with no flash 3) record high quality video 4) have reasonable zoom for photos as well as videoP300 - NikonThis camera is small = very pocket friendly being the third smallest on the list, equipped with a fast lens ie f/1.8, and has good zoom @ 4.2X, video res; 1080p @ 30fps, sensor is CMOS.  This camera takes really good low light pictures, the lens and CMOS sensor helps a great deal with this. Also, the P300 takes closer macro pictures than the other cameras as well as a wider angle. However, the video can be choppy/jumpy at times.  The P300 scored 3/4 on my scaleS95 - CanonThis camera is still very pocketable, however it is the second smallest on the list.  The lens is a f/2.0, zoom @ 3.8X, video res; 720p, sensor is CCD (CMOS is better) however the CCD sensor in the S95 is around double the size of the two cameras with CMOS and the S95 has a superior digital processor.  Out of all the cameras when considering general photography as well as low light photography the S95 takes the best pictures out of all 4 cameras.  However, the video is of lower quality and is easily to see when comparing.  Also the video mode does not allow any zoom.  This camera scored 3/4 as well.LX5 - PanasonicThis camera is the least pocketable of all the cameras listed to the point that I would not be able to fit this camera into my pants pocket.  The lens is a f/2.0, zoom @ 3.8X, video res; 720p, sensor is CCD (CMOS is better) however the CCD sensor in the LX5 has the largest sensor out of all 4 cameras.  Out of all the cameras when considering general photography, and low light the LX5 falls slightly below the S95, however the LX5 is the most superior camera for macro shots out of all 4 cameras.  The LX5 video also though 720p is still superior to that of the S95 and P300.  Also unlike the S95, the LX5 can zoom during video.  The only negative for this camera was it's larger size.  Again I score this camera a 3/4.WX5 - SonyThis camera is the smallest out of all 4 i.e. 40% smaller than the canon.  The lens is a f/2.4, zoom @ 5x, video res; 1080p, sensor is CMOS however, this sensor is smaller than LX5 and S95 CCD.  The sensors nor the lenses are not the only thing to consider, the processor and it's software are also rather important.  That is where this camera really shines.  For general and low light the LX5 and S95 win, but not by a large margin.  The WX5's video is only second to the LX5, since the LX5 captures better overall and lower light images.  I scored this camera a 4/4.To summarize best;Low light photography = 1)S95 2)LX5 3)WX5 4)P300General photography  = 1)S95 2)LX5 3)WX5 4)P300Size (smallest)  = 1)WX5 2)S95 3)P300 4)LX5Best Video  = 1)LX5 2)WX5 3)S95 4)P300Most zoom  = 1)WX5 2)P300 3)LX5/S95S95; What killed it for me was the non ability to zoom during video, and the low amount of zoom as wellLX5; What killed it for me was the too large of size, if you can get past that for your use it is the best choiceP300; What killed it for me was the terrible video and lower low light performance.WX5 vs. WX9 vs. WX10What is the difference between these cameras and why should you consider one over the other?WX9 lens is f/2.6 however, it is the thinest of the three camerasWX10 lens is f/2.5 however, it has 7.6X zoom but is the thickets out of the three camerasThe WX9 and WX10 are more expensive, the only reason you should consider the WX9 is if you want an ever so slightly larger screen and ever so slightly thinner camera.  As for the WX10 it has better zoom and better image stabilization.Here is a picture I took at club Moon in Las Vegas with my WX5 of Hip-Hop artist YelaWolf.[IMG][...][/IMG]", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "High quality full HD camcorder in your pocket!", "Author": "geekmeister", "ReviewID": "R3GPHXU16UF7UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is perfect for any parent who wants to preserve their kids' adorable moments for posterity but doesn't want to lug a camcorder around. Being just such a parent I was looking for a pocket camera that could replace my aging and trusty Canon SD870IS (which shoots a perfectly acceptable SD, or standard definition video), but I wanted to start shooting in full 1080P HD (with stereo sound). Until this little SONY camera came along, nothing fit the bill. I purchased this camera the moment it came out on the market (with little or no reviews to fall back on.) I wasn't disappointed. No, this camera is not perfect, but if you are looking to shoot full HD video AND have the camera fit in your pocket, you can't go wrong with Sony DSC-WX5.Here are some pros and cons:PROS:- Shoots very high quality HD 1080p (and 1080i) video. Perfect pocketable HD camcorder replacement.- Excellent low light video capabilities (almost zero noise in videos).- Excellent photos in good light (sometimes almost DSLR-like), good in low light (with some noise reduction artifacts).- Decent optical image stabilizer (but not perfect - keep your camera steady for best shots).- Beautiful, high-resolution screen (I recommend getting a HARD clear plastic screen protector - the screen seems fragile).- Metal body (feels very well made)- Small form factor (this thing is tiny and extremely pocketable!)- Fast 5X zoom. The zoom toggle is very sensitive and well positioned.- Great 24mm wide-angle lens that can record wide areas - very rare in video cameras for any price.- Easy to navigate menus- Dedicated video recording button (can shoot video no matter the current photo setting). Perfect for catching those unexpected moments.- Recessed ON button make it nearly impossible to turn on the camera unintentionally (and risk breaking the lens).- Everything is very automated (easy for non-techy people and especially useful when shooting kids.)- Can shoot very sharp HD in both AVCHD 60fps 1080i and MP4 30fps 1080p (I only shoot MP4 because I hate interlaced videos and desire highest level of compatibility with video players and editors. Please note that shooting at 30fps requires slow panning to prevent jerkiness in your videos)- 3D photos (requires good light and lots of practice).- Can use standard SD flash cards (not just Sony Memory Sticks as in times past).CONS:- Battery life is mediocre compared to older cameras (but many newest HD pocket cameras on the market today are not much better), especially if you shoot lots of video (so buy spare batteries - I bought some aftermarket ones at an auction site for $15 / each - they work just fine). Some Amazon resellers sell cheap aftermarket batteries as well. Batteries are very small, so get 2 or three extras.- Videos record some low level auto-focusing and optical stabilizer noise that is audible in some quiet settings. Zoom noise is also recorded (so, I try to avoid zoom when shooting videos, but it's nice to have it available when needed - most pocket camera disable zoom.)- Camera occasionally has trouble auto-focusing in video mode (especially in dark settings.)- A non-standard connector for file transfer (Sony like proprietary stuff). Not a big deal, but still...- Recessed ON button (a plus against accidental camera activation) can be hard to press, especially if you have large fingers and short fingernails.- When using flash sometimes the left corner of a photo is darker when completely zoomed out to shoot widest area possible - protruding lens obscures flash (a limitation of positioning of the flash element on cameras of this size). No biggie and sure beats annoying pop-up flashes in some of the newer pocket cameras by other manufacturers.)- Very few manual controls.- Some noise in low light photos.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "A very, very good camera", "Author": "Alexander Jon", "ReviewID": "R2ORUPK74U7E42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those looking for a point and shoot without a whole lot of manual controls this is the camera for you. Although like others have mentioned it's not perfect.PROSPicture quality - this is what most point and shooters care about.  Good looking pictures and this camera deliversLow light pictures - this camera takes great shots in low lightClearly explained picture modes - when you rotate the dial to change the picture setting, this camera explains very clearly what the mode you're changing to does, and what it should be used for.CONSBattery!!! If you buy this camera do yourself a favor and pick up and extra battery.  If you're snap happy you can easily drain the battery in less than a day, if you're on a sight seeing vacation or at a wedding, you'll want to ensure that you have a spare charged battery ready to go.Processing time - Part of the reason this camera takes such good pictures is it's processing process.  However this means that after a shot, the camera can take several seconds to process the picture. When you have a group posing for a picture and you want a second shot it can be a little annoying to have them hold their smiles while the camera puts the previous image together.The on button - It's a small thing. But the on button can be a little difficult to press. You can get the camera on the first try most of the time, but occasionally you may have to try more than once which can be a little annoying.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "easy to use, wide lens, fast shutter seed, great in low lighting - LOVE it", "Author": "Rachael", "ReviewID": "R3HYLVA27MZOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is AMAZING.  I wanted a camera that was very easy to use, could shoot well in low lighting, and that could take portraits with background blur.  This camera does it all with automatic settings!  It also performs very well in the automatic mode.  It has a lot of different scene options to chose from, and some really awesome features.  It is very small, considering what it does.  It also has a wide angle lens, which is great for capturing interiors, and a very fast shutter speed.  I am so happy I bought it!

Let me tell you the picture quality of the little Casio camera is excellent. It is only 5MP but for our needs (we don't print posters or crop a lot) it was just fine. I just wanted to add a good HD video capability into a small and compact point and shot camera like the Casio. The first camera that I tested was the Canon SD-1400. What a disappointment. The camera is small and sexy but the number of blurred pictures was so big and the overall picture quality was not really good. The HD video was just fine but you could not use the zoom. Returned the camera for a refund.Then I tested the Panasonic DMC-ZR3. The Panasonic was just a bit bigger than the Canon but with 8X zoom that can be used on the HD video. Picture quality was good overall and pictures were always on focus, but the main problem was the horrible low light performance of this camera. The flash seems not powerful enough. Also, not so important, but a factor, the camera is compact indeed, but not-ultra compact and it looks a bit awkward and boxy.  Went back to Amazon too as there was no way i could keep it, although I tried hard.Finally after more research, I found the Sony Cybershot DSC-WX5. I found the answer to all my needs. It is small and very compact that was an important need and will always take clear pictures. Indoors and specially in low lights situations, the Sony will perform really good. Although I got it on sale, the Sony was about $80 more than the Panasonic and Canon I tested. My rational was that I'm buying a camera that i hope o use for some years and paying the extra money will not bother me if I really can meet my needs. Picture quality is outstanding both indoors and outdoors. The camera shoots HD video in 1080i and stereo, something that is not really common for an ultra compact camera. HD video quality is really good. The camera uses a Cmos sensor instead of the regular CCD sensor that uses most compact cameras. For the video is really important as with CCD if you have a strong light in your shooting area, it will make a vertical white line in your video. With Cmos you don't have that Although the 5X zooms is enabled during video shooting, the motor is noticeable during zooming in a quiet environment. Not a huge negative but it is indeed a negative. Another negative is the battery life. The battery is very small and if you shoot a lot of video, expect it not to last long. I was in a party and took about 60 pictures plus around 10 HD videos of 3 min average and the battery was almost empty already. I will certainly get a backup one. You can get a generic replacement on Amazon for around $11 and an extended life one with double the capacity for around $18. It looks like a must for this camera if you plan to shoot a lot of video.The camera has also other capabilities as the 3D which I didn't test yet (you need a 3D TV) and the sweep panorama mode that will automatically stitch frames for you creating a panoramic picture in your camera without the need of an external software.All in all, this camera is a great buy and exactly what i was looking for. Will recommend it warmly.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony makes the best palm digital cameras", "Author": "Erol Esen", "ReviewID": "R28W4INMNZ9LMY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update: June 11, 2012I've had the camera for a year now, and still love it! The reason I'm writing this update is because I began to see a dark spot in the images. Then I hit the Internet, did a little research, and found out that dust can easily get in and the best way to clean it is with a vacuum cleaner (thanks grizzlysteve74!) I simply pointed the hose right on top of the lens assembly and zoomed in and out a little while the vacuum cleaner was on. It's a little scary, but it works and doesn't seem to have damaged the camera.Original Review:Digital cameras that you can put in your pocket are important, because they're so practical. This camera is one of the best in its class. There is everything you can expect from a digital camera. It has an amazing focal depth that can easily cover, length-wise, a regular Jesus-table (about 30 feet) from one end to the other with remarkable focus and clarity. Super-cool panoramic sweep would let you take a Da Vinci front-shot perspective, just as well.One negative might be the whirring noise of the motor as you're zooming in and out during HD video-shoot. That's why previous Sony cameras didn't allow for changing the zoom while the video is recording. This comment also reveals the sensitivity of the awesome stereo microphones.A cute icing on the cake, is the 3D shooting...and viewing. The way it works is you take a picture just like you're taking sweep-panorama, what the intelligence in the camera is doing is that it's calculating the left-right view-planes of the 3D physical world. You can later view it on your TV or computer screen with 3D glasses. There is, however, a way to view 3D on the camera, as well: the camera has a accelerometer in it, so that when you tilt the camera, the view changes to give 3D-like perspectives. It works in a limited way, but still impressive.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality is Amazing but shot-to-shot is slow", "Author": "Azzy", "ReviewID": "R24HJP9FV879P4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The pictures are excellent.

By the end of the day she knew how to delete previously taken pictures and store the rest on her mac.The camera has a lot of functionality, most of which is unnecessary for 95% of users.

They never took great pictures, only so-so ones. I would purchase a new one every couple of years hoping it would produce better pictures. They never did.When I decided to purchase a new camera this year because we are going to Disney, I recalled some great pictures taken by a Sony Cybershot camera someone had at work. The pictures had turned out great despite the low light/night time venue, and that was something that I have struggled with using cheaper cameras. That particular model of Sony was no longer available, so I decided to check out customer reviews and found this camera.I love this camera! It has several really cool features such as the panoramic option or the blurry background option that I never even thought I needed or wanted but have used several times. The camera was $250, a bit more than the other cameras I have purchased, but not too pricey. Well worth it. You get what you pay for I guess.
