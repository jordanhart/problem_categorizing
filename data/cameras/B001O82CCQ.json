It creates this bright red light so if you need to do this on the sly that's nearly impossible. You have to look at the camera lens dead on to see it. Therefore if the camera is high you need to stand on a chair, if the camera is low you need to crawl on the ground. If the camera is in a corner pointed at a weird angle, good luck finding it with this. It's not obvious either when you find one, I think it would take hours of training to use this product successfully.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "junk", "Author": "Tami Veltri", "ReviewID": "R38VPOPZQDY1FJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This did not work on anything i tried it on my phone camera and on a hidden camera that i know the location of.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Looks like cheap crap but it WORKS GREAT!", "Author": "Phenixred \"Phenixred\"", "ReviewID": "R1N05PD696QVRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first saw it I thought \"how is this cheap thing going to find anything?\" When I tried it in several places I'll be damned it worked! The strobing red lights reflect off a camera lens. You will get it reflecting off of other things, if you move your position it should stop, if it dosent its a camera.I tried this in several diffrent places. I tested it on KNOWN cameras and places I thought they were. Turns out my local reasturant had cameras out in the open AND behind a mirror and in the hardwired smoke detector. DO NOT try to use this in a bank the manager will not like it LOL.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera detector", "Author": "dc in Iowa", "ReviewID": "R1E9VPLWEQK5SB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was not impressed with this, it was pretty much a waste of money in my opinion.  For whatever reason it cannot be returned, I wish I would have realized this BEFORE I spent the money, because I would not have purchased it.  Its not like I had it for months, used it constantly and THEN wanted to return it. I used it maybe 15 - 20 minutes and found what I was looking for WITHOUT it.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001O82CCQ"}}
