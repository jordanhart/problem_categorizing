{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fugifilm S1800 is a great value", "Author": "T. Kindrick", "ReviewID": "R2XWI9YRWFR56G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera after a few months of researching point and shoot digitals. I bought a Sony P&S; in Dec. '09 for almost $200.00 but it was limited to 3x Optical Zoom so I returned it. I decided to wait until I could afford an entry level DSLR so I would have more control over all the setting and focusing features but I was in a Radio Shack one day when I saw the S1500 and I really liked it. I went online to check out camera reviews and they were very positive so I went to Amazon to check out prices. That's when I found the S1800. I bought it because it has more Optical Zoom and it basically the same price.I have been very pleased with the photos it takes. The only drawback I found is the time it takes to auto focus and it was slightly smaller than I thought. The size isn't really a factor for most people but I have large hands and slight nerve damage in my neck that causes my hands to shake. The anti-shaking features work very well but it does take longer for me to focus at high zooms because of the shaking.I would recommend this camera very much for anyone who wants to take the next step in digital photography and can't afford a DSLR.ALSO the bundled package was a fantastic value. I HIGHLY recommend it.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for a very reasonable cost", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R1O9HM3ENV11VT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought Fujifilm Finepix S1800 a month ago, and so far have taken over 700 pictures, both indoor and outdoor. The camera is the best in this price (approx. $ 180-200). I've searched the whole net, and checked all other brands, such as Canon, Nikon, Sony, Pentax, Kodak, but none have a camera at this cost and so many capabilities. I specially enjoyed the X18 optical zoom, scene recognition, panorama and burst mode. None of the peer cameras have 18 zoom at this price range. The quality of photoes are very good, but it may take a bit longer so one knows how to set everything for outdoor photography, specially in low light conditions. I suggest buying the bundle as bought it. It comes with 8 GB memory card, a card reader, case, batteries and charger, etc. I paid $ 229 for the bundle and I'm very happy! If I wanted to buy all these stuff separately, I'd to pay much more!So, I highly recommend, both the camera and the bundle!", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic FujiFilm", "Author": "Dottie A.

I get great pictures every time in any kind of lighting.I also love how this camera has a manual setting. More experienced photographers can set the desired aperture and shutter speed. But it also has scene recognition and auto settings for when there's no time to mess with controls.Not to mention the great price.

I learned on a gorgeous 35mm Leica from WW II era and so point & shoots have always been problematic for me. Main problem is that I could never seem to get sharp focus using the back display rather than a viewfinder which VERY few digital cameras have until you spend $500 or more. My search is over, however. I can get sharp clean edges with the viewfinder on this camera and I don't need an engineering degree to figure out the controls; it's pretty intuitive and I never thought I would say that about a digital camera. I purchased the Finepix in this package deal and am so glad I did so. It's a fabulous value. Thank you thank you thank you Fujifilm.

I used the camera even without having a chance to look over any instructions and found it very simple to use, although my last camera was a fuji.  In fact, that is why I looked to purchase another fuji because I really liked my old one,  it had just seen all the use I could give it.  I then photographed a wedding the next weekend and found the camera absolutely great to use as far as ease, focusing, picture, and I really like the size of it.  You can hold in one hand if needed!
