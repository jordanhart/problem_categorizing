It works great. Sometimes the pictures have rendering problems but I always take multiple pictures. The battery life is incredible as well. Would recommend this to any one, especially for the money.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Zamma", "ReviewID": "R16UWA58TZBCMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Casio EX-h15 is an awesome camera! Compact,fits in your pocket, great price, picture and video quality is right up there. I love the fact of editing my photos into new ones before having to do that feature on my PC! Wide angle lense is very nice too! While videoing you can snap a picture and video is continued. I'm just begining to learn all the features. You can't go wrong and highly recommend this camera!", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": "Amazon_trial", "ReviewID": "R33KJUUEVC50IQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an absolutely wonderful camera. I had an EXILIM years ago and decided to try it again. The quality is stellar and for the price you pay it's a steal. The colors are vibrant, images clear and the interface is user friendly. In between my two EXLIMS (this one and my first one) I bought an Olympus and a Cannon. They were all simple point and shoot cameras. However, nothing beats the quality of the Casio EXILIM. Next time I have to get a camera I won't think of even trying anything else.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "24 mm wide-angle lens\n1000 pictures on one battery charge\nThe digital brain of the EXILIM camera is the EXILIM Engine 5.0\n14.1 megapixel, powerful high zoom", "Name": "Casio EXILIM EX-H15 Digital Point & Shoot Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21zXknoMoSL.jpg", "ProductID": "B003XSA9DO"}}
