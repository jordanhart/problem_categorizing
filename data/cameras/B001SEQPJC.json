Love the large LCD screen. Another great feature is that it automatically knows what setting to use without you having to choose, i.e., landscape,portrait, etc. It is so user friendly. Love the size because I carry it in my purse at all times.  Be sure and get the backup battery that is recommended because with all the features, the battery runs down fast.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great video quality+very good image quality+ease of use=awesome camera!", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R65FLJBMTH5RR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my red T900 for a few weeks and here's a list of the things I love, in roughly decreasing order of importance:- GREAT video quality. This camera shoots 720p videos at 30fps, and the quality both indoors and outdoors has far exceeded my expectations. I previously used a T100 but also use cameras from Fuji and Casio for some occasions, and the difference between the T900's 720p high-quality mode and the typical VGA fine mode on other cameras is like day and night. Not only do you get HDTV resolution, the colors are more vibrant and the clarity is just great.- You can optically zoom the lens during video recording. This is a must-have feature for me as I mostly shoot video clips of my kids.- Very good still picture quality. This is no digital SLR, for sure, and the image quality is probably not as excellent as Canon's and Panasonic's compact digital cameras, but it's still very good. I read some reviews before deciding on this camera and I had worries about picture quality, but they were dispelled the minute I reviewed the still images on my PC. Very good contrast and clarity, and they make great prints.- Smile shutter. I never thought I'd buy into this feature, but now I absolutely love it! You can set the sensitivity to three levels, and you can even choose \"child priority\" or \"adult priorit\"! And it really works! This is just totally awesome for taking still shots of my kids. (Smile shutter does not work in video mode.)- Large 3.5\" touch-screen LCD. There're no conventional controls, just touch-screen, like most Sony camcorders. The LCD is 1920x480 in resolution, and the menu text looks a little jagged, but you'll love its brightness, fast speed, and clarity for viewing images.- Fairly easy to use. Sony employs a top-level HOME menu system with sub menus, but it's not too confusing, just a tad harder to figure out the advanced stuff than on an, say, iPod touch.- Stylish and feature-rich. This is quite thin but still features 4x optical zoom with optical stabilization. The zoom also works in movie-recording mode. It takes Memory Stick PRO Duo cards up to 16GB. Battery lasts about 150 pictures with flash. Not bad. It's light-weight so easy to carry in a pocket, too.In short, I love this digital camera. It's perfect for all occasions.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best travel camera", "Author": "Sunshine", "ReviewID": "R3TEZH8IX2WFH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My mom has used Sony Cyber-shot cameras for years, and she loves them. So when this came out, I decided to get my own. The sliding cover to turn on the camera is convenient and allows me to be ready to snap a picture immediately. The screen is big enough to adequately analyze a shot and determine if the quality is good enough to keep -- plus I can now show my pics to others right on my camera. With an entertaining nine-year old daughter, the video option allows me to capture action anywhere we are, without having to lug around my camcorder. I LOVE this camera. Thank you, Mom!", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Compact and easy to use", "Author": "Craig G", "ReviewID": "R3SMM2N8PI6XMQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is very compact and produces HD video and pictures. Like most cameras in this price category, low light conditions will ruin your video or picture if you don't use a flash. Very easy to use via the touch screen on the back. The video is 720p HD in mp4 format.The biggest con with this camera is you can't simply plug it in to recharge the battery. You are required to pull the battery, and plug it in to a separate charger unit. Plus being Sony they don't use standard USB cords and have their own that is a base unit you must mount the camera on in order to download your media off of it. The other con is enabling the flash. You can't manually turn it on like most cameras. The only way it's available is if you use the simple mode and then you have control over it. If you want to use a custom mode or one of the other predefined modes then you are locked out of using the flash. Why they did that I have no idea. Makes the camera slightly less useful to me.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "REALLY GOOD CAMERA", "Author": "J.

The buttons on top of the camera, which helps you turn on/off, zoom in/out, review pictures and switch modes are all shut down at once. I don't know what's going on and then contact the sony online customer service which ask me to ship back the camera to have a further check up in their factory store. Unfortunately, my warranty just expired by 5 days so I have to pay at least 141 as a flat rate excluding other serious hardware problems. However, I will not ship this product back and have it fixed, which indirectly putting more money into sony's pocket! The ridiculous price for the repairing can buy me a brand new camera if I add few more bucks and it's not even guarantee that the camera will be completely fixed by that price. I am very disappointed at the duration of the camera, which only last one year and will never buy sony ever again.  I hate to say this, but sony is way too sensitive and expensive for the quality and duration of its cameras though the picture quality and format are pretty good AS LONG AS it doesn't break. Once it breaks it's just a piece of rotten metal sits there occupying space and evokes frustration on its short life.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cyber cool but needs some work", "Author": "iDiotgear \"iDiotgear\"", "ReviewID": "R1R3CEONUGL8GV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned many different brands of point and shoot cameras such as Nikon, Kodak, and Canon. There's a few things I do not care for with this camera:First is the lens location. It's easy for myself or anyone to smudge the lense. it's located on the upper right side when looking towards it. When you try to hold the camera steady with both hands , you will naturally want to hold it at the sides with your thumb and forefingers. That's where your index finger will touch the lense. You have to consciously think how you want to hold it.Second the usb transfer cable is only in the docking unit. That's another bulky part to take with you and in fact I don't know where I have placed it.Thirdly it seems to overexpose the pic. Unless you're in the perfect lighting the picture will need some adjustment.Lastly is the switch for camera and video. In your pocket or purse , the switch is easily moved from left to right which switches to video. It takes a few seconds switch to different modes once you have the power on.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "W.
