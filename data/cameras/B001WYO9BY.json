{"Reviews": [{"Title": "excellent camera for about 160.00", "Author": "Merle E. Lee \"after one vacation\"", "ReviewID": "R13KI0PLCA00PT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for the everday user.  It takes excellent pictures in the auto mode which will please most.  For the more advanced user there are lots of manual options to override the default settings.  It is small, and shops into a shirt pocket.  As with most delicate technical devices it should be handled with a little concern.  The colors come  out vivid when in the default auto mode. It does a decent job at nighttime shots, and low light conditions.  You will be very happy with the pictures.  With the optional SD card it can take about 1,000 pics but the battery does need to be recharged about once a day with normal use, and you must remove the battery to charge it but you will not need to buy aa bateries.  I shot about 900 pictures in Honolulu and about 85 % are very good qualities.  I had some trouble holding the camera still and some were not of acceptable quality but that was my fault and not the camera.  This camera is availabe from many sellers for about $160.00.  The SD card will set you back about 19.00 and a back up battery another 20.00.  I found the battery was enough to shoot all I wanted to shoot for about one day with no lost oportunities to get that shot.  It excells when filming sand, ocean, clouds, and has face detection, smile detection, antishake, options.  Reading the manual is a must - do not attempt to wing it.  It does not have a carrying case but you can get one at wal-mart.  It also take video clips and brackets the shots by several options. Panaramic sticking is accomplished inside the camera.  The zoom is quite adequate and it does have a macro mode too. I found that the pictures are better than many of the large name brand camera including the Fuji which I tried and returned to the seller. I am happy and think that you will be too.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Favorite Point and Shoot EVER.", "Author": "AKJ81", "ReviewID": "R2MTDF6O77X9T3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this damn camera. I take it EVERYWHERE, which may explain why I've lost it and had to order a replacement TWICE now. As long as this camera is available, this is my go-to. The light meter is phenomenal (does well in low-light and non-flash settings.) Its fast shutter and processing ensures you dont miss those fleeting photo ops (like, with kids moving around) and the quality of the image rivals that of a DSLR (of which I also have). love love love this camera. And GE? Who knew? I cant believe this camera doesnt beat the sony's and the canon's on the market, all of which I think lag and are too slow. None of their non-flash settings come close to producing the rich, practically 3-D images like this GE. Thats what happens when \"Brand name\" surpasses Quality. Its a shame.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "My 12-year-old LOVES her new camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1NCLFZ1UB3J8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a birthday present for my 12-year-old daughter and she couldn't be more thrilled with it!  I do want to point out one thing in case others come across the same thing.  We originally purchased a Dane-Elec SDHC memory card for this camera and the camera kept freezing up when you reveiwed the photos and wanted to go back to picture taking mode.  After calling GE and telling them what was going on I was told the memory card was defective.  I wasn't sure I believed this, but had to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I have to call Dane-Elec directly because the store where I bought my camera won't exchange it for me.  I purchased another memory card from a different brand and the camera now works flawlessly!!  I've seen other reviews on other sites about this camera freezing up so hope this review helps others out there.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "GE Camera", "Author": "Joseph Scalera \"Papa Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R26XTXG7TRDABY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has everything other like products have but this excellent camera costs $100 or more less.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's okay", "Author": "Leann A", "ReviewID": "RF4YRVXECW1NI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is intended for the technology literate people.

By simply cancelling the flash I was able to take great indoor pictures, and outdoor night ones. The video feature works so well, that I stopped using my video camera. It is so easy to download to your pc and from there to an IPod.
