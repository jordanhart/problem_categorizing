Sound quality is also surprisingly clear.  Mention is made of using it as a web camera, but no link to software drivers.  A fun little toy, once you figure out the many video and photo settings and control.Four stars because description shows a micro SD card, but none is included.  They aren't expensive but you have to buy one to fully use the camera.The LED light can be a little bright and defeats the purpose of a clandestine camera.  Lighters generally do not blink!

It takes a little bit to figure out how to work it, but this thing came in handy. I recorded my sons friend stealing our change. We never new why the change bin was never getting full, now we know. Good product, just don't forget to buy a mini flash drive. it requires one.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very cool tool", "Author": "Jann Burner \"jann@townsqr.com\"", "ReviewID": "R32NL9W6G7XKWB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ran across this item by accident and it is worth getting.  It is a still camera, a video camera, a voice camera and a flash memory device. And it can be left in sleep mode, to come on when it hears a noise.  And it is only $25.  (I got mine a few weeks ago and it was only $16, not sure why the price has gone up.)  And the \"cool\" thing about it is it looks exactly like a `Bic' lighter! A word of warning though, this isn't a \"quality\" camera but it is good for gathering any sort of quick \"information\" and the sound pick up is very good.  It will pick up a TV program from across the room perfectly clear.  But in hand held mode it is a bit tricky to hold it perfectly still.  Better to sit it down on a surface when pressing the \"still shot\" camera mode. No software, no cables, just plug it into the USB on your computer and there are your pictures or video! You do have to get a \"micro\" SD card to go with it, but they aren't very expensive and it then functions as a regular \"Flash Memory\" device so you can put all sorts of files other than \"photo related\" onto it.  Very cool and only $25!", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Waste of time/money", "Author": "W.

It isn't the greatest, the instructions are poorly written and the build quality is marginal, but it does work pretty well. I'm giving it 4 stars just because it's price is so good. This thing is sold elsewhere for as much as $90.The user interface, (button) is a bit confusing but once you play with it for awhile and figure it out, it does seem to work as described. The alignment of the camera with the little hole on mine was a bit off, but it was pretty easy to \"tweak\" it into alignment. The video quality isn't too bad as long as you have adequate lighting. The sound pick up is amazingly sensitive. Need to buy a micro SD to use it. It doesn't come with one.It is an ingenious design but could have been implemented just a bit better. Still it is convincing enough and unobtrusive, The way it is made, it completely comes apart quite easily and I can see opportunities to retrofit the electronics into any number of other objects.Overall, if you're not a little bit tech savy, you may have probelms with this, but it's a great buy for the money if you don't mind having to play with it a bit to get it to work the way you want.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Wilfredo Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R1YV8OHE83H1DO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product came on time and works like a charm I used like a security cam sometimes and I saw things happening in my house that I never imagine was happening, thanks for such a good product.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "ok", "Author": "bueno", "ReviewID": "RABGKCPWX37YM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ok todo muy bien con este equipo.. lo ocupe para lo que necesitabaok todo muy bien con este equipo.. lo ocupe para lo que necesitaba", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "That Vegetarian Guy", "ReviewID": "R1R30YTV007KOF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Avoid this item at all costs.
