{"Reviews": [{"Title": "S8100 was worth the wait!", "Author": "Mike C. Carlson \"Mike Carlson\"", "ReviewID": "R2JMYCN2JYWHMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, I was really wanting the RED Nikon S8100 but apparently only black is available unless you buy it directly from Nikon. I decided to go black because I live in Oregon where there is no sales tax, and Nikon was going to tax me and add $10 to the shipping. Black isn't all that bad looking anyway and it matches my Cooler Master HAF-X PC case.I'm upgrading from a Sony DSC-V1.  The size of the Nikon is a hair wider, a hair shorter and about half as thick.  The DSC-V1 had a po-pup flash in the same area as the S8100 so I was used to holding the camera the correct way already.  For those of you that can't think outside the box, the proper way to hold this camera is to make a gun with your left hand, thumb pointing up, then bend your wrist so the gun is pointing to your right, then place the camera in the gun. RTFM. This tip is printed (and pictured) in the quick start booklet that came with the camera. Once you get used to it, you won't mind pop-up flashes at all.  The only issue you will have is when your dense friends take pictures of you with it and hold the flash down, not knowing any better.The downgrade from the S8000's 14 megapixel CCD to the S8100's 12 megapixel CMOS sensor is no downgrade whatsoever. Megapixels are nearly irrelevant to point and shoot cameras above 12 anyway, and the image quality increase, and low light shooting improvements you get with the CMOS sensor EASILY trump a 2 megapixel increase. I am continuing to be surprised how good my pictures keep turning out, in all light levels.The 10x optical zoom is great, but what is amazing is how clean the digital zoom is beyond that. I am used to fuzzy or blurry shots when using the digital zoom, but this camera somehow gets around that. The placement of the zoom lever forces you to use your right forefinger instead of your thumb which I'm used to. It felt kind of odd at first, but makes complete logical sense from an ergonomic point of view when you are holding the camera properly. On the opposite side, the macro function floored me. For a point and shoot camera, I never expected a macro this good. It macro shoots better than my Cannon DSLR. I can rest the lens up against the object I'm shooting and the image will still focus good.The LCD screen on the back is a typical 3\" screen, but a very untypically high quality resolution. It has the highest resolution screen of any point and shoot I could find. You can really see the detail of what you are about to shoot with it. It's bright and the colors are accurate.The 1080p video this camera produces is better than I expected. Far better. You can use the zoom feature while rolling AND take stills simultaneously. It also records in stereo sound. Great stuff.Some people complained that this camera is still a bit too large for their liking.  If it was any smaller that it is now, you would not be able to hold it without accidentally pressing a button or something, and it fits in my pocket just fine. Those people must have toothpick fingers or don't realize that size much smaller than the S8100 really isn't much of an advantage unless you are some kind of top secret spy or something.The camera has all the basic features you would want, and several that are kind of neat. Manual on the fly brightness, hue, and vividness adjustments can be handy, the skin softening feature turns your subjects into super models, and the ISO sensitivity range is above average. It has a wind noise reduction option while taking video, and all the features you would use the most are easily and quickly accessible.I know I'm sounding like a Nikon fanboy now but I'm just so happy with this camera. The only thing I can think of I don't care for is the rubber stop that plugs the USB port on the bottom of the camera. I prefer a flip door, but this is just my preference.It comes with surprisingly good full version photo editing software, and even a panoramic stitching program that I've yet to try. The full manual is on a CD that comes with it though I prefer a book to look at. The start-up speed (power on to photo ready) is just under 2 seconds. Holy cow batman!One feature that I haven't taken advantage of yet but look really useful in action shooting is the high-speed shooting at five full resolution frames at up to 10 frames'per'second, and  a pre'shooting cache that records up to two shots before the shutter'release is fully pressed. This will really make it easy to get the action shot you really want. The other feature that I'm very impressed by is the advanced Night Landscape mode which combines a series of five consecutive shots taken at a fast shutter speed into a single image with reduced noise when taking hand held shots.  Dark backgrounds turn out very visible without over lighting the subject. Very cool technology idea.In summery, I feel like the $299 I paid for the Nikon S8100 is very justified. DSLRs should be nervous that these point and shooters will start stealing their market considering the lower price, quality and technology improvements.

The Canon came out first, about three weeks ago, and I immediately bought one.I played with it for a week and decided it just didn't live up to my expectations (in auto mode: flash too bright and uncontrolable, images NOT razor sharp, 36mm lens too narrow). I returned the Canon 4500 and ordered the Nikon s8100 last week.  What a difference! If picture quality is your main concern (which is, of course, every photographers main concern) this little baby really shines. In auto mode, images are razor sharp and super bright with or without flash and throughout the full range of the zoom. I don't know if it's the Nikor lense or the auto focus system but these pictures are superior to any point and shoot I've ever played with. The Cannons image quality was similar to a lesser priced digital point and shoot. The Nikon is a full step above this.  There are a few small negatives: the worst being the rediculous placement of the pop-up flash. Each time I've attempted to take my first flash picture of the day my finger has been over the flash which prevents it from fully opening. At least a note comes on the monitor which tells you that the flash is not fully up. Once the flash is up it stays up until you manually push it down, so it's not like this problem occurs every time you take a flash photo. I'm sure I'll find a different way to hold the camera to avoid this annoying problem...but it's certainly not a deal breaker.  This camera does not have as many manual controls as the Canon 4500 but if I want to get super creative I'll use my SLR.  It's also a tad thicker than I'd like (about the size of a cigarette pack) but can still fit in your pocket. However, both the lens and the monitor are not recessed or protected in any way and scratches will be hard to avoid. I'm using a soft suede pouch when it's in my pocket to protect it.  Overall, I'm very happy with the Nikon s8100 and highly reccomend it for anyone looking for super high quality photos in an easy to use reasonably priced camera.UPDATE: Took camera out for first extended shoot on Halloween night. Did not perform as well as I'd hoped for. All pix shot in low lite (outdoors, night) in auto mode with flash. Flash way too bright to the point where some pix were washed out with too much lite. Will try previous commenters suggestion of playing with the limited manual controls to attempt to correct this problem. Images NOT as sharp as day time shots without flash.Will update again very soon as I'm taking out the camera again today for day AND night shots.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Still photos & features, poor focusing in video & zoom noise", "Author": "Saibal", "ReviewID": "R2WR3Q8D5T8FD0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE: I have returned the camera today after observing two issues that are dealbreaker for me. We finally had a bright sunny day today and I took some videos to compare against my 3 year old Canon Powershot TX1 that shoots 720p. I also received my mini-HDMI cable so I could watch the video on my 42\" LCD TV directly without post-processing thru Apple TV box.ISSUE #1: The video keeps going out of focus while I zoom or pan - whether I set center, weighted focus and/or single AF or continuous AF. The recorded video looks really bad. On the other hand my TX1 stays rock steady with the focus.ISSUE #2: There is a loud zoom motor noise that gets recorded in the clip. I initially thought that continuous AF or Image Stabilization is causing the noise. I put the camera on a tripod and disabled continuous AF and the noise remained and it was clearly there when I operated the zoom.The still photography feature of the camera is stunning, but video is important for me as well as I want to carry only one camera on my travels.I love the 3\" LCD on this camera, but the two issues pushed me over the edge.Original review below:This is my 1st Nikon. I have always purchased Canon ever since I used a Canon A1 35mm film SLR nearly 30 yrs back. I own a Canon Digital SLR, Canon DV Cam, Canon Powershot TX1. Most of my photography during travel/vacation has been with the TX1 shooting both stills as well as 720p Video which I edit on my Mac and then stream thru my Apple TV.I have been looking forward to replacing my TX1 with a camera that is:- compact like TX1- bigger and better LCD screen (TX1 has very tiny one)- shoots 1080p with full optical zoom (not handicapped like Canon has done with all their 1080p shooting compact cameras that don't allow optical zooming during video recording)- good range of optical zoom- image stabilized lens- reasonable number of pixels- better low light shooting- shoot moving objects- separate shutter button and video recording buttons - this is very useful when the subject is not waiting for you to fiddle with the rotary selector as with most cameras (except for TX1 which had this feature).It is important for me give all this preamble to relate to what my expectations were from this camera.Gave up on Canon finally, looked into Panasonic ZX7 - didn't like the reviews and waited patiently for the release of Nikon S8100. Received it today. Have taken some shots and here is my first impression.1. I am happy with the image quality of the stills2. Great quality of 1080p video (haven't tried the 720p mode as yet)3. Optical zoom is very good (the rate of zooming slows down during video recording)4. Controls are simple to use5. Very fast focus response6. Very fast start time7. Very good image stabilization8. Face detection works very well (even on images on TV)9. Very good build quality (feels robust) - just like my TX1Only negative: The position of the flash. It is the place where you would normally grip the camera with your left index finger. If the flash wasn't a pop up type, this could have been avoided.Overall, I am very happy with the camera. Will move on to try the remaining features in the next few days. Have to get hold of the mini-HDMI cable to test the direct to TV playback of 1080p video.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best camera I've ever own", "Author": "Optional \"Optional\"", "ReviewID": "R3GY9P4HL6MS49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually don't write review.  But I'm writing this now because of the unfair reviews due to user errors, not the camera. I was born in a photography family that has been in the business since the 60s.  I do know how to work a camera, I know what a correct setting is for different light situations.  This is the BEST camera in its category I have ever own, and I've own a lot: Canon, Sony, Pentax, Panasonic, Nikon all in the same category and price range (at the time of its release). Although it's classified as \"point & shoot\", there are pre-set settings that you have to know when to use them and when NOT to use them.  So this is an advance point & shoot camera which requires user's knowledge to fully leverage its features. If you are NOT generally savvy with electronics & computers, don't buy this camera because you don't have the knowledge to leverage its features to your advantage, it would just be a piece of junk & a waste of money for you. But if you are, this is the BEST camera in its category.I took picture of a small printed picture, inside, no flash, low light, it came out looking almost close to the original.  I took pictures during family Thanksgiving dinner, again no flash, normal room light, the pictures came out perfect: clean, clear, vibrant, naturally light as you see with naked eyes.  I generally don't like using flash as it doesn't project the real natural light (this include super professional cameras).  So I'm extremely excited that this camera can capture indoor low light without flash, looking like what you see with naked eyes. With ALL of my previous cameras, this wasn't possible, the pictures would just come out lacking of color, a lot darker than what you see with naked eyes and grainy.Out door, the zoom is crisp without sacrificing the quality.  The color is rich, clarity is flawless without grain/noise (I do not use digital zoom, only optical zoom for best quality). Object from very far away coming out looking like you are standing right in front of it and take a picture.I haven't used the video feature because I don't use a picture camera as a video recorder.  I have a video recorder and I use it to record video.  I expect a camera just to be a perfect camera.  It's dumb to expect a camera to perform an exceptional job in video recording.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon S8100 vs Canon SX210 performance comparison", "Author": "lindguini", "ReviewID": "RPDZ3JTRGJHFQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATED 1/14/11:I was hoping to find a still/video camera that would give me the low light performance of my Fuji F20 and also allow me to avoid hauling around a separate HD camcorder.  My comparisons show that the low light photos from the S8100 handily out perform my Fuji F20 and by a good margin (which is no small feat considering that the 6MP Fuji F20/F30/F40 pretty much set the standard for low light performance in point-and-shoots).  If great low light photos are what you're after, the S8100 is very good (but there is a penalty for this performance as I explain below).  However, if you also want great low light video, the Nikon does not deliver.  In my two weeks of testing, I've determined that the Canon SX210 is the optimum choice if you want the best balance of low light photos and video.Here are my observations after two weeks of testing:NIKON S8100 PROS-Nice build quality and easy-to-handle design.  Feels like a pro-sumer $600 camera.-Outrageous 3-inch, 921K pixel LCD display --excellent clarity and detail.-Decent HD video in daytime lighting.-Powerful flash that provides excellent illumination at all zoom settings (no flash shadow at wide angle).-USB battery charging in camera (can connect to your PC to charge).NIKON S8100 CONS-No manual control except for +/-exposure compensation.-No brightness or white balance settings for video (versus Canon's excellent custom controls).-Videos are simply too dark in low lighting (the Canon wins by a landslide here)-Auto white balance is fooled by compact fluorescent lights (Canon's AWB is more reliable).-Camera prefers low ISO settings even in low light and this can cause motion blur.-Significant zoom motor noise during videos (versus the nearly silent Canon SX210 zoom)-Pop-up flash must be pushed back into camera body before stowing camera in case.-Camera beep and shutter release sound can only be turned on or off (no volume adjustment like Canon)CANON SX210 PROS-Very good low light video, video brightness control really boosts low light sensitivity.-Very good still photos, camera chooses higher ISO settings to reduce motion blur-Camera displays its ISO choice when you pre-focus (not possible with Nikon)-Extensive customization settings for every shooting mode (versus limited Nikon settings).-Widescreen LCD for full frame HD video display-Very good build quality-Pop up flash automatically raises or lowers when you power on/offCANON SX210 CONS-Body design makes for tricky handling (no rear thumb grip, smooth surfaces)-LCD is only 230K pixel (compared to the incredible Nikon 921K pixel display)-Still photo viewing area is much smaller on widescreen display-Overall still image quality is slightly noisier than Nikon but only if you're pixel peeping-Some flash shadow at the 28mm wide angle setting (disappears from 30mm on up)STILL PHOTO QUALITY COMPARISON:Photos in good lighting are comparable between the Nikon and Canon.  The Nikon has the least noise at higher ISO settings.  In low light, the Nikon really shines and if you take photos of non-moving subjects, the S8100 is your best choice.  However, there's a penalty for this performance:  the Nikon chooses very low ISO settings (and therefore low shutter speeds) to achieve low noise photos --not good if your subjects are moving (you'll get blur).  At high zoom, both cameras have to use lower shutter speeds and every super zoom camera suffers from this issue --it's the problem most people complain about when they try out their new cameras.  The only way to solve this problem is to either use the flash or set high ISO (something the Canon does automatically) in order to force the camera to select a higher shutter speed.  There is no other solution and no camera has yet been developed to solve this problem -it's a compromise of light, optics, and sensor sensitivity in compact camera bodies.  For all around shooting, the Canon is more reliable since it chooses higher ISO (and hence faster shutter speeds) to capture non-blurry images.  The Nikon's lower automatic ISO \"choices\" will result in more blurry shots indoors unless you use the flash.HD VIDEO QUALITY:Both cameras have very good HD video and excellent image stabilization in daytime lighting.  As with most super zoom compacts, focus lock in low light is a challenge but the Canon SX210 is better than the Nikon if you want faster focus lock during video.  in reality, the Canon operates more like a dedicated camcorder with all the tweaks and settings you can imagine --credit Canon's long history building camcorders.  Unfortunately, the Nikon operates as if video was a second thought feature and there's simply no way to improve its performance since there's no manual control.  The Canon's low light video brightness, focus speed, and silent zoom motor make for great video under all conditions.  Conversely, the Nikon's noisy zoom motor is recorded in videos and the camera simply can't provide bright, usable videos in low indoor lighting.  In low light, the Canon is in a league of its own.  If you're trying to video children or pets running back and forth quickly at close range to these cameras then you'll be disappointed in ANY super zoom compact camera you try.  The fact is the ultimate, magic \"focus anywhere instantly\" machine has not yet been invented.  However, as an alternative to lugging around a dedicated HD camcorder, the Canon SX210 is hard to beat for convenience and consistent HD video quality.OVERALL:I really, really wanted to keep the Nikon S8100.  It has superb handling quality, great low light still photos and an impressive 921K pixel display.  I have owned several Canon and Fuji digital cameras and have never seriously considered Nikon's point-and-shoot offerings until the introduction of the S8100.  However, the Nikon is not a well-rounded still/video camera.  It does a few things very well but fails at others.  The Canon SX210, on the other hand, is a much better performer at each end of the still photo and video spectrum.  The Nikon is great camera to hold and operate from a hardware standpoint, but the Canon simply out performs it when it comes to getting the best quality photos and videos under a wide range of shooting conditions.  After months of research and camera testing, no single camera does everything perfectly.  However, I believe the Canon SX210 provides the best balance of performance among its peers if you're looking for a pocketable, super-zoom camera to provide both good photos and HD video.UPDATE:  SPECIAL NOTE ON POP-UP FLASHA lot of people complain about the pop-up flash on super-zoom cameras since the flash is usually located on the top left corner of the camera body and occupies the space where you want to hold the camera.  Be advised that the pop-up flash is a physical necessity in order to move the flash far enough away from the camera so that the long, super-zoom lens doesn't cast a shadow on your subject when the flash fires.  If you really don't like the inconvenience of the pop-up flash then your only choice is a limited (7X or less) zoom camera or a bulkier SLR-type.  If you want a pocketable super-zoom, you'll just have to get used to this flash placement.  It may be a minor inconvenience at first, but in the end it's a non-issue and should not be the sole reason you give up on the incredible performance that compact, 14X zoom cameras like the SX210 have to offer.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great zoom, very good Continuous", "Author": "D.

I enjoy skiing and snowmobiling in the winter, and a compact camera is much easier for those activities.  Additionally, I always carry a camera in my purse just in case the perfect shot comes up.  Almost all of my pictures are either landscape, or action (pets and sports).  I was actually researching for a camera as a gift for someone else when I found that there are a few cameras now that provide a large optical zoom capability AND the continuous/burst modes.  These 2 features in combination in a compact camera exactly meet my requirements. So far I am very pleased with the pictures from this camera.  I've posted several photos at this Amazon camera link for people to view that demonstrate the features most important to me.  There are 2 pictures with an Airstream trailer, one at no zoom, the other at 10x zoom.  That zoom is amazing.  Fantastic clarity and detail (even when I zoom in on my computer).  The continuous shooting is not as good as my DSLR, but still very acceptable.  I added a couple of photos of my cat and golden retriever taken in the continuous mode (12MP*).  These photos demonstrate shots from very slow motion up to very fast motion.  I printed a few shots as 8.5 x 11, and the printed pictures came out extremely clear.

Usually I wait for the reviews and buy then but the features on this looked good and besides, its Christmas! (almost).  This Nikon s8100 a just a little bigger and heavier (10x Zoom) than the Canon IS1100, 1200, 1300, 1400s (3x Zooms), needs a \"slightly\" bigger case.  Camera startup is reasonably speedy, something less than 3 seconds from start/focus/take picture in low light ( faster outside).  Good enough for me. Very little shutter lag, comparable or better than other good digitals I've owned (Canon A710, 1100is). Focus is fast and accurate.  This is a next gen camera so it should do all of that stuff well and it does.  Weight: yes it weighs a little more but feels solid.  Guess Nikon hasn't figured out how to make a good  10x zoom lens weigh less than a \u00bc gram, darn those guys!.  Focusing: yes when I zoom in and try to focus closer than the lens physically can get it won't focus (10x has to be something over 10' or so).  Another law of physics Nikon is unable to overcome, darn those guys again!  Low light pics: very nice.  Low light video also very good, but there is one setting in video the 1080 without the star where the video looks dull. Don't know why, set it on the star 1080(default) and leave it.  No manual controls: I didn't buy this for the manual controls (its a point & shoot remember, get your Binford 5000 25pound mucho $$$ rig out for the tricky stuff), I just want to whip it out,  take pictures and video, and it does that well.  Pictures and video look very good, better than my other cameras.  The video focus will hunt a TINY bit when zooming, but, this camera WILL zoom during video, unlike others.  Low light video is good but the more you zoom the less light you get (gee! That's like all my other cameras EVER, and its a 10x zoom, not 3x or 4x) So, video  works  good when you compare zoom distance to light collection.  Auto scene mode doesn't pick the right scene indoors in low light (wants to use night landscape), use Regular Auto in that situation.  Auto Scene works OK so far otherwise.  Flash is good and fairly powerful for a small unit, exposure mostly about right. You just need to hold it differently than other cameras for the flash to pop up on the top left side, one handed pics (for right handers), no problem.  Battery life, not as good as others, but OK.  Use the USB cable to charge the battery in the camera,  4hrs, OR, get an extra charger and battery and do it that way, you HAVE A CHOICE with the s8100.  Oh, BTW, (as others point out) the USB cover FEELs flimsy (I couldn't really care less about this... it works).  Haven't found any large flaws yet.

I've never owned a compact camera anywhere near as fantastic as this camera.  Every single thing it does is a mini miracle.The zoom is seamless and it focuses faster and clearer throughout the entire range than many SLR lenses I've used. The new sensor is unbelievable.  A sign of a good camera is its capability to take pictures in the dark.  That's something I always look for when buying a new camera.  This camera has new technology for its \"night portrait\" mode.  It actually takes a picture without flash (so as to capture the light behind you) and then takes a flash picture.  It then combines the two shots giving a true to life image of the the person and background.  You can't tell that it takes two pictures because it all only takes the time of a normal flash picture.  Same goes for \"night landscape\" mode.  I tested it by taking a flash-free picture of my kitchen at night with all of the lights in the house off.  In the photo, you can actually see the oven and refrigerator and even read the clock on the oven and microwave. And it's not even noisy (grainy).It has many advanced features for a compact, such as the ability to view a histogram and to look at the information of pictures you've already taken, like the ISO sensitivity used.  Very handy if you like how a picture turned out and want to try to repeat the results.And then there's the video.  While I mainly bought this camera for its photo capabilities, there is no denying that this little guy makes fantastic videos.  Extremely clear and realistic.  The sound could be a bit better, but it's certainly not bad enough to complain.  If you're recording something silent, you can hear the zoom a little, but isn't that true with all video cameras?  This camera also has a great feature for slow motion videos.  I've never been so amused as I have been while trying to find things to record in slow-mo.So, in summary.  The photos are crystal clear and true to color.  The new night shooting capabilities are the absolute best I've seen in a compact camera.  It has 10x optical zoom plus around 4x digital. And it records full 1080p HD video. AND it's all in a cute little compact package.  How can you beat that?Oh, and the color of the red camera is the most gorgeous shade of red I've ever seen.

I chose the Nikon Coolpix S8100 and the Canon SD4500IS to compare.  It took a lot of research between the two, but finally I went with the Nikon.  I'm so happy with my choice.  First it's an easy camera to pick up out of the box and use.  The dial on top is simply marked and it even has two scene icons, one for those of us who are challenged in selecting what we're actually looking at and one for those who can actually distinguish between people, kids, pets, and landscapes.  The video record button is located on the right upper corner of the backside which is a nice feature for instant recording.  There are a lot of features available to learn to use and the manual covers all.  The test for me was a party in a restaurant which was dimly lighted.  I was amazed at how well the photos came, with and without the flash. It certainly passed the lighting test.  The only downside for me is the flash is a pop-up on the top of the left side where I always rest my fingers.  I have to learn to hold my hand off the flash.

We were looking for a really good p&s; with a great auto mode and we narrowed our choices to the Nikon 8100, Sony HX5V, ZS5 and Canon SX210is.  We decided to go with the Nikon because of the 1080p video, cmos chip for lowlight shooting and 914k pixel LCD.  The pics come out beautiful but you may need to reshoot sometimes due to flash overexposure or blurriness in low light (pretty standard with these mega zoom compacts).  The video is also great just be sure to get a class 6 SDHC card or better and change the options to HQ video and pics(for some reason Nikon defaults to the lower quality).  I also recommend not using the continuous AF (you'll hear clicking sounds in the video).I'm not crazy about Nikon not supplying a battery charger, instead you charge the battery in the camera with the usb cord.  Come on Nikon!  It also doesn't automatically reposition pics taken in portrait mode (you'll need to put the camera upright to review).  Hopefully they fix that with updated firmware.  I wish the wide zoom (30mm) was better but it's ok.  The menus could be a little more intuitive and a printed manual would have been great (it's on a disk like all other camera's these days).  Finally, the software Nikon supplies is lousy.  Come to think of it, all photo software from camera manufacturers is lousy.  Just go with Picasa for photo organizing and light editing and Photoscape for more robust editing.  Both free.Anyway, it may sound like I'm nitpicking but it is a pretty good p&s.;  A few firmware fixes will make this camera shine.

Zorach \"Alex Zorach\"", "ReviewID": "R2POY9VZK58O9P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using a Canon for a number of years, I was pushed away from Canon by the fact that their newer cameras have an unusually slow continuous shooting mode.After sampling a large number of cameras currently in the $200-300 price range (as of several weeks before writing this review, when I purchased the camera), I settled on this one as there was simply no contender: no other camera, even significantly bulkier ones, offered the same combination of low-light, no-flash performance with general all-purpose quality.I have been VERY HAPPY with my purchase.  I think this camera offers unparalleled value in its category.  However, it has a few minor downsides which are minor, but regular annoyances.I'll start with the strengths.  As I see it the benefits are:(1) Small size--small enough to fit, in the case, in a large pocket, or out of the case, in a much smaller one.  Convenient case by the way!(2) Ease of use - it doesn't matter if you're used to another brand of pocket camera before: this one is extremely intuitive and easy to pick up.(3) OUTSTANDING low-light no-flash performance.  I can't emphasize this point enough: this is one of the main reasons why I bought the camera.  ISO 400 and 800 work very well: 400 is especially sharp.  There's an option for 1600 and 3200, and while I use them infrequently as they're nosier, I'm glad they're an option.(4) Image stabilization works really well, which I'm sure contributes to (3), but it also contributes to low shutter-speed far-zoomed-out pics as well.  Taking pictures of stationary targets, the camera handles gracefully down to 1/5th of a second, which I find absolutely remarkable.(5) This camera takes very, very good photos.  I think Nikon put a really good sensor in this camera, creating a balanced overall package rather than just inflating the megapixel and zoom rating the way some brands do.  There are other cameras on the market that I tested, including some from canon, that have \"more\" zoom and \"more\" megapixels but when you take photos side-by-side with this one, they come out less sharp--both when looking at closeups and when looking at the farthest out optical zoom.(6) Face recognition actually works.  I don't really care about this, but it's kinda fun and is a bonus.(7) Quick startup time.  Things in general are fast, except for two problems which I discuss below.  Quick time between photos, surprisingly quick flash cycling even.Caveats / Downsides: (These are all relatively minor complaints, not deal-breakers, although they're all things that are annoyances that I notice on a regular basis.)(1) ISO speed, which I change VERY frequently, requires going into the menu to change.  This is very cumbersome.(2) ... [EDIT:] addressed in comment, thanks!(3) Flash performance is relatively poor, especially in contrast to everything else about this camera.  Flash photos tend to have exceptionally poor color, relative to how well the camera does everything else.  Also, the auto mode really doesn't handle the flash gracefully--you need to fidget with things to get sharp photos.  Since I don't like using a flash, it's not a big downside, but I do want to point out that this camera really lags behind in this area.  Sometimes if you just point-and-shoot in auto mode, and take a flash photo, the result can be pretty awful...either bad lighting, too grainy, and the biggest problem, terrible color balance.  You can learn how to work with the flash but it takes adjustment and fidgeting and you can't just expect to take good flash photos out of the box.  The only good thing about the flash is that it cycles very quickly.(4) Writing images, even with a high speed memory card, is very slow.  If you take a number of photos even in moderately quick succession, and then close the camera, you often have to wait several seconds, which is a bit annoying.  Deleting images is even slow.(5) Continuous shooting mode, while very fast, only supports 5 photos at once.  This is really not enough for me.  Writing in continuous mode can be very slow, and you can't shoot again until it's done--the wait is about 12 seconds at the highest resolution.  By bumping down to 2048x1536 you can dramatically speed this up to 5 sec, and you can get a really quick cycling by using the tiny 640x480 resolution.(6) Perhaps a bit overzealous on the noise correction.  Sometimes when you edit out noise, information is lost, and when I really zoom in on the photos produced at low ISO's, I think some sharpness has often been lost, and I wish the camera would leave these photos grainier, as it's always possible to edit them (sometimes better than the camera could itself) after the fact, but it's not possible to get back what's lost..So, bottom line?  Excellent camera.  No real contenders in its size / price range.  However, not perfect, and it could be substantially improved.  Some of the downsides are things that", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "hydroman72", "ReviewID": "R310EPZDKU1F11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is great.

Even in a well lit area, it seems that the aperature get's very small so the result is a dark video.  You'll need bright sunlight to use the slow motion feature.  Can someone explain this?3 - Compact, if you're looking for a compact camera, better buy something with less features.  You'll probably be shooting in auto anyway so sacrifice the features and go smaller.  This camera is bulky to be carried in you pants pocket or a small purse.  Also because Nikon's lens cover (my description) has multi panels, it can be accidently opened, so you probably buy a small case which will add more bulk.As for the camera, it shoots great pictures and the flash is much more powerful then the compact point and shoot.

When I got mine and started shooting with it, I wondered if I read reviews about the same camera.  The image quality was terrible, and very inconsistent.  In the rare chance that I got a decent shot, only the center was focused, and the image defocused very quickly towards the sides.  I think the left side was a little worse than the right.  Furthermore, the image also became noisy outside of the central regions, especially near the edges.  The noise sort of reminded me of too much jpeg compression, but it's not quite the same.  Also, the images had a lot of distortions away from the center.  This is outdoors in good lighting.  I'm guessing my unit had a lens problem.  Indoors with lower lighting, the images are even worse without flash, and over exposed with flash.  So I am not seeing where the improved low light quality is.Another problem is some slop in the zoom control.  If I push the zoom either way and release, the zoom action will overshoot a little.  So it's hard to get it to the exact zoom level needed to frame the subject.I have an old Coolpix 3200 with 3.2 megapixel capability, and it takes much better pictures than this S8100; it consistently took sharper pictures in the proper lighting without any of the image anomalies that the s8100 produced.  Sure, in low light, the 3200 images are noisy, but that is expected.  Its other big problem is that its responses are too slow.  So I was hoping to find a replacement with faster response and better low light imaging.

I will confess I didn't go out of my way to check, and assumed it was included.Since Amazon doesn't list what's in the box, I'll list it here:- manual- wrist strap- software- AV cable- USB to AV cable (aka charging cable)- EH-68P AC-to-USB adapter- EN-EL12 battery- and of course, the cameraEvery Canon camera I've owned for the last 10 years has always come with a dedicated, compact, wall-mount, battery charger with a flip-out AC plug, eg: CB-2LB.  The Nikon 8100 came with an AC-to-USB adapter (EH-68P) and a USB-to-miniAV cable, which forces you to charge the battery INSIDE the camera.I don't think I'm in the minority when I say that I generally dislike having downtime on my camera while charging.  I also don't like having to pop out some plastic/rubberized tab on the camera and stick in a proprietary cable repeatedly, which eventually leads to a broken cable or broken port.  What's worse -- the AV cable port is on the bottom, which means that your camera can't even sit upright when charging -- it has be to be placed on its lens or its LCD.  Far from ideal.I completely don't understand why this would make sense on an electronic device that has an easily removable battery.  Perhaps this could be a cost-savings move on the part of Nikon, but at the point they're shipping you an AC-to-USB adapter, they're not saving a bundle.Of course, you can buy the Nikon MH-65, which is a dedicated battery charger, but you'll notice I didn't say \"compact\", or \"wall-mount\", or \"flip-out AC plug\", as none apply.  The MH-65 does not mount directly on the wall, but comes with a long AC cord and a slot to insert your battery.  Not gigantic, but far from compact, if you include the cord.  The MH-61 is a wall mount that was designed correctly (albeit for a different series), but starting with the MH-62 up to the MH-65, Nikon has abandoned the wall-mount capability in favor of an AC cable.  Perhaps too many people were electrocuting themselves on the fold-out AC plug?  I have no idea.With a compact, wall mount charger, you can pop the camera in one pocket, and the compact charger and buy a spare battery for your other pocket, and you're an instant road warrior / vacation photographer / etc.  With the Nikon, you're now stuck carrying a cord as well, which adds considerably to the bulk.  Sure, you can look around on eBay for a generic charger with a flip-out AC adapter, but I would be a bit concerned about the quality of said charger.  It'll probably be fine, but with Li-ion batteries that can incinerate when overcharged, it makes me think twice about whether or not I'm willing to trust a generic charger.All that being said, the Nikon 8100 came in at 2/3rd the cost of the Canon 4500 (at least for me - your mileage may vary), and even with the annoyances surrounding the battery charger, it's an incredible camera for the size and cost.  I would recommend this camera to a beginner who dreams of DSLR-quality shots, but is not willing to put in the necessary hours (and hours) to hone one's skills, as well as the minimum ~$1000 one needs to get a decent body, flash, and lens.  This is just my opinion, but these compacts are good enough and smart enough to allow a complete beginner to get a better shot in difficult conditions than a beginner-intermediate user with a DSLR.Minus 0.5 star for a noisy zoom lens and antiquated interface.

Unfortunately, none of the tricks worked on my *error* camera.So I sent it back to Nikon, thinking it should at least be covered by warranty, given that I only bought it for 10 months. In the end, no, it's not covered, and the repair cost is half of what the camera is worth.Another thing is, after about 2 months I got the camera, it started to have message telling me the flash light is not fully on or something, even if I push down the flash and retry it over and over again. Just when I was thinking to return it,  this error just magically disappeared, so I kept it all the way till 8 months later, when it broke, completely, and cannot be repaired under warranty.So, I don't know what to say.The picture quality is good for a point and shoot, the video quality is also very nice. I guess what I'm trying to say is, this is a nice camera, when it lasts.If you are ok with changing your point and shoot camera every year or so, this could be a good choice. Otherwise, go with something steadier.As for me, it's time to look at other point and shoot and say farewell to Nikon, well, at least to the point and shoot type.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera lasted exactly 8 months", "Author": "Judy in Pacific NW", "ReviewID": "R125SCKSJMXJ9U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After 6 months I started getting card errors, and it wouldn't display some images.

(The Sony had begun to show dust on the sensor, and since the camera is a sealed unit, I can't correct the dust without sending it away to Sony for an out-of-warranty repair, and I was getting tired of correcting/cloning the dust bunnies in post processing). I thought I'd thoroughly researched replacement brands/models, and this Nikon S8100 was my best choice.Pros: Terrific form factor, brilliant LCD screen, 10x optical zoom, usual Nikon quality, support, warranty.Cons: No high-speed-shutter scene mode, which makes this unacceptable for my travel camera. Not being able to force a high shutter speed without jumping through hoops (pushing ISO and then remembering to put it back to \"normal\", or using \"Motion Detection\" which unfortunately is disabled for any ISO other than \"Auto\", or using one of the Burst modes which forces a 1M or 5M down-sized capture depending on which burst mode),... limits its usefulness for me when shooting photos from a moving ship, boat, auto, coach, etc., or when handing it to someone to take a snapshot... even in full Auto mode. I'm not expecting full shutter-priority, but having a high-speed-shutter scene setting was more critical to me than some of the other presets, like a \"Food\" preset.The S8100 is the first digital camera I've owned that forces you to charge the battery inside the camera. That makes having a spare battery a minimal benefit since you can't charge one battery while using the other in the camera. The very flimsy cover over the charging/power socket might be an issue over time due to stress fatigue.Unfortunately, I was never able to work out the high-speed-shutter issue, so this otherwise terrific Nikon was  returned for a refund.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very low quality & horrific customer service!", "Author": "icewiz30", "ReviewID": "R14GNE3MCA5NNN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I do not typically write reviews but I had to on this camera after my horrific experience with Nikon.

This camera replaces my previous Canon Powershot Sd750 Digital Elph. The SD750 was a fine camera and served me well. But it was inadequate for any decent video recording.  But I was very familiar with the Canon menus and design, and enjoyed the layout and look and feel of the Canon. In the end, I went with the Nikon Coolpix S8100 over the Canon SD4500 for a few key reasons: First, the research and reviews indicated that the Canon may be better suited for video recording but the Nikon holds the edge for the photography. And the Canon menus were supposedly better navigable than the Canon.Here are my first impressions: The very-lightly rubberized/texturized feel of the Nikon is superior to the Canon. This camera feels like a robust, serious, all-business professional camera, vs. Canon feels more like a cute, artsy, fun, weekender camera. I got the Nikon in the red finish, which looks absolutely amazing and gorgeous. The menus are very easy to navigate, and I felt right at home. I did not feel like I was missing out from having switched to the Nikon, from the Canon. The backlighting feature is amazing - I had taken countless indoor portrait pictures with my old Canon that were no good because of backlighting (this is when the subject appears all \"black\" or washed out/shadowed when you take the picture near a window with sunlight coming in, indoors). The video recording is very, very nice, and full 1080p, no doubt.  I purchased a Lexar Class 10 SDHC 32GB 133x write speed card ($75) as the memory card.  The 10x optical zoom is simply amazing - it presents a huge opportunity for weekend and fun photography.The things I mind, but can live with (cons):  While you are recording video, you can *definitely* hear (and it will get recorded) the sound of the zoom lens motor, especially if you are zooming in/out all the way. But it's not the end of the world or a showstopper. If there is other sound that is part of your recording, you will be fine. If there is NO OTHER sound (it's a quiet recording), then yes, if you are zooming in/out, you will hear that, when you play back your recording.I also bought a spare battery and separate charger, so I don't have to \"tie up\" the camera in order to charge a battery.I give this camera a 10/10 -- it meets/exceeds my expectations.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT camera!

It is light and easily fits in a shirt pocket, I have large hands and this one is very easy to hold. I can't say the same for other small cameras I've used.  Although the image quality is not as good as a DSLR, I've been very pleased with the images this takes.  Almost any point and shoot can take decent images nowadays.  What separates a good one is the ability to take images under less than ideal lighting.  This one does a very good job at dealing with high-contrast or low light situations.  By cranking up the ISO, I've taken some very nice shots under very low light, without flash.  The screen is bright and accurately displays colors.  The camera starts up quickly and has a zoom range tha  is adequate for most needs.  The battery seems to have more than enough life for a day of casual shooting.I do agree with some reviewers that the pop-up flash seems to be right where you want to place a finger when  holding it.  When I first started using it I missed a couple of shots because I was accidently holding the flash down.  You do get used to it and all you need to do is change the way you hold it.  I'm not sure if there would be a better place to put the pop-up flash... and yes all things being equal,  a pop-up will take better pictures than a built in flash.I wish it could record video in something other than MOV format.  This may be a matter of personal opinion but other formats are easier to work with and support by more applications.  The video quality is not great, but on par with other compact point and shoots I've used.  If you want high quality HD video, with great sound, prepare to shell out a lot more money on a dedicated video camera.SO WHY ONLY 3 STARS?  I only used the camera about three months when it started malfunctioning.  It would lock up after taking 1 still shot, the zoom stopped working.  If I tried to take video, it starts to record it but I cannot stop without powering it off.  All of this happened at once. I called Nikon and after trying several things they agree that it was defective and asked me to return it for service.  Of course this happened a few days before our Disneyland trip.

We just welcomed our first baby to our family and were looking for a new camera that could do both video and pictures. We have several cameras including a Panasonic 3CCD mini-dv camcorder, a Panasonic FZ20 digital camera and a Sony W150 point and shoot digital. All take video but in standard definition and we wanted to move to an HD camera. We looked at the Flip but didn't like that it lacked a zoom. As far the FZ20 and W150, they are both disappointing when it comes to low light (no flash) situations. The Sony was especially bad with a lot of noise in the pictures. The Panasonic FZ20, even though lower in mega-pixels but with a faster 2.8 lens, did a far better job but still resulted in a lot of blurry pictures most of the time. We went with the Nikon based on the price and promised low light performance compared with other cameras from Fuji, Panasonic and Canon. The comparable Canon is about $100 dollars more. Our friends have the Canon PowerShot SD4500IS. They like the Nikon 8100 better. We compared indoor video and photos and found the Nikon to have less noise and be both sharper and brighter. I do have to state that we compared the cameras indoor using only available light. However, both the Canon and Nikon still produced a lot of blurry pictures when hand held. The best bet no matter what is to use a tripod or some other support. Hand held shots were difficult even at the widest angle. So far, there hasn't been any non-dslr, low range cameras that we've tried that can take perfect picture in low light all the time and still have a reasonable long lens. The video quality on the Nikon is superb by far. Black is true at night and not grainy gray. The camera is good at handling the high contrast of a night video. Auto focus in low light was also fishy on both, but could be managed. The camera settings had a big effect on pictures. When the camera was set to indoors, the pictures tended to be slightly darker, but sharper. In contrast, pictures taken on full auto tended to be brighter, but blurry. To wrap it up, the Nikon performed better then other cameras in bad lighting, but still not perfectly. This keeps the camera in 4 star range for me. I like it, but I don't love it. Almost great, but just misses.PROSSolid constructionSharp lcd screenEasy to useGreat video, zoom works well (1080, 720 and standard def available)Good button / control placementConsidering price, good in low light, but not perfectGood color definition in picturesGood form factorPrice vs competitors.Cheap third party batteriesConventional, Apple friendly mpeg video unlike some...panasonic AVCHD liteCONSIffy plastic covers over HDMI and USB portsStrong flash with awkward placementNo included HDMI cableBattery must be charged inside cameraNo included paper manual (cd only)At four inches long, slightly difficult to find a right-sized camera bag", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "More than handy - dandy little camera", "Author": "shalala", "ReviewID": "RXXBUIFBF4QNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I considered the S8000 for several months, read reviews and wondered whether I'd be able to appreciate point and shoot quality when I'm used to the Nikon D90.

And honestly, I didn't want to have to think about settings much.  Meanwhile, the S8000 came and went, replaced by S8100, and I went for it.  I love this little camera.  The quality is good enough that I don't hesitate to pull it out often.  I've gotten some amazing photos with it, including the full moon before the eclipse.  Because it's so light, it's easy to hold still for night shots, even without a tripod.  I'm used to a viewfinder, so there have been a few times when I grabbed it fast and couldn't figure out how to see the picture.  My goof.  I also forget to keep my left finger off the flash pop-up once in a while, but I quickly learned to move it off the flash the moment I feel the pressure.  I don't like to shoot with built-in flash and I have to remember to program the flash not to fire when I start the shoot.  I don't plan to shoot videos with this little camera, so I can't comment on that feature.

I have a video camera for video. I was buying a camera solely for still photography, and, if that's what you are looking for, there is no better in this price class. I did extensive research before buying - I had never had anything but a Canon in the point-and-shoot category before. I tried out the comparable Canon and Lumix before deciding on this one. I could not be more pleased.  No one does true color better than Nikon, and its AUTO mode is off the charts spot-on, even for difficult shots in weird light with subtle effects (sun pooling through a forest canopy, for example, or dusk on a street as the neon lights come on). I like a mix of AUTO and manual - this one has it, and manual is extremely easy to call up and use, unlike that mode for the other two brands. The preset modes can also be manipulated to produce high contrast and backlit effects, among others I have yet to fully explore. Indoor flash photography! Amazing! Soooo tired was I of the washed out deer-in-the-headlights effect of the Canon - finally, I take a picture of my dog, and it looks like my dog, you know? It seems a small thing, but hard to find at this price. The zoom is also fantastic - image stabilization works well with this, unlike the Lumix, supposedly the best rated in this category, but in my try-out, irregular at best. Other complaints in reviews have to do with the location of the flash - not a problem for me. I just don't put my finger there - there's no particular reason to do so. The flash quality is such that I am not going to complain about where it's located. My biggest problem with the camera is that I can't find a camera pouch to suit it. Too many of those advertised on amazon.com say they will fit the somewhat more \"square\" geometry of the S8100 in point-and-shoot pouches designed for the Lumix or Elph.

Therefore, I feel like I can make fair comparisons.  This camera is not horrible.  In many respects, it's pretty good.  But it is very disappointing compared to the competition.  And therefore, I cannot recommend it.On many of the basics, it's quite solid.  Image quality is good.  Ergonomics are good (if you don't mind the pop-up flash).  And it's reasonably quick and responsive.But ... it's not any better than comparable cameras.  In particular, I got it mostly because it was supposed to be so fast.  But it's really not.  Autofocus isn't any faster than others.  Flash doesn't recharge any faster than others.  And image quality is on a par with the competition.And ... it has a few major problems.  First, it overexposes when you use flash.  A significant number of my shots using flash are entirely blown out and unusable.  That's just unacceptable!  It hasn't happened with any of my other cameras.  Second, it seems to have a slightly less reliable autofocus than other cameras.  It's not horrible, mind you.  But that's a few extra shots that get ruined on top of the flash problem.  And, perhaps not a major problem but still a real headache, it doesn't reliably record orientation information.  If I take a picture in portrait orientation instead of landscape, it only occasionally comes out properly on my computer.  Most of the time I have to rotate the pictures on my computer.  It's a pain.Again, the camera isn't bad by any means.  It's just that, at this price, you can do better.  I sold my Sony HX5V -- a camera with which I was very happy, and which I highly recommend -- to get this.  I did it because this had very good reviews and it was supposed to be very fast.  It is no faster than the Sony, and it has many more problems.  I wish I hadn't sold the Sony, and I may have to buy another one (or another camera).  So do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.I should add that I do not care about the video, so I have not tried it.UPDATE: It seems that if you are patient, you can avoid the flash overexposure problem.  You have to wait until after it has perfectly focused before you take the picture.  If you try to rush it -- which I often do, because I'm taking pictures of fast-moving children -- the flash may overexpose.  I've been taking it slowly for a couple of weeks and it seems to work.  So I've upped the rating by one star.  But it's still disappointing.UPDATE 2:  Well, even with patience, you can't avoid the overexposure problem entirely.  It seems to occur less often, but I definitely still happens, no matter how slow I take it!  I've noticed that it sometimes just picks a ridiculously high ISO level, so I've chosen a reduced ISO range and that seems to help as well.  We'll see over time.  But even if it does, it's still unacceptable.UPDATE 3:  Changing the ISO level to max out at 400 when you use flash really helps.

But most of the pictures I've taken with it have come out blurry so far.Another cool feature is the subject tracking, which puts a target on your subject and keeps them in focus even as they are moving so you get a non-blurred picture.The zoom is pretty awesome, especially compared to my old Coolpix.  It really gets up close.As previously stated, the Flash is in the worst location possible.  I found it under my left index finger as I was about to take a picture and it tried to pop-up.

It's very crisp and clear, just like the still pictures. I can't imagine why anyone would need a home video camera if you have this camera.

You can hear the zooming mechanical sounds in the audio of the video when you zoom in and out.

I played with all the features and settings like changing the lighting (indoor, natural, etc.) and I ended up adjusting the brightness to where it was turned to a darker setting for taking all my pictures to even out the brightness of the flash.Overall I liked it a lot, and I do recommend it for casual picture taking, but I was wanting crisper clarity because I do a lot of cropping photos on the computer to get close-ups of my child's face (without sticking the camera in his face). The video was great though. Very clear and easy to use. The zoom was great too, especially for a compact.

I also have a Canon DLSR.  The Canon Powershot's screen went black, and would no longer take pictures.  It was well used, and I feel that we got our money out of it. The Sony Handicam, however, was less than 3 years old, and rather expensive.  The only video it will shoot now is upside down and backwards.  Yep!  Not that that isn't hard to maneuver because everything is backwards when you tape, up is down, left is right...  Not to mention the image is flipped and everyone looks a bit odd.  There is an image flip feature on the software, (now I know why) but even then who can watch the video unless you are videotaping something in one place?  After a little research I found that both these cameras had the same sensor from a 3rd party, and they were known to go bad.  There was a window they would fix the Handicam, but mine last longer.  At  $300 to fix, I just decided not to fix it.That's where this little camera comes in.  I do not lug my SLR around everywhere, and I needed another camera to keep in my purse, and to take video.  I looked at a couple cheaper Kodak's and the color was awful and there was a lot of washout from the flash.  I couldn't decide between this on and the Canon SD1400 IS.  The Nixon has 10x zoom and 1080 video, and is a bit larger and sturdier feeling.  I paid $230 6 months ago (on sale) when they were $299 everywhere else. I purchased it from Walmart, simply because their warranty gives you an immediate trade in and they hassle with the manufacturer.  I think we have all been in that boat trying to get our stuff fixed or a replacement.  This is the first warranty I have bought in years because of an ill-deal with a stereo at Sears.The camera is sturdy, starts quickly, and you cannot beat the low light images.  A lot of my pictures are indoor functions, and this takes the Canon SLR on far away,  florescent lighting shots.  I like the 1080 video, the zoom, and the ability to takes pictures while taking video.Drawbacks:  I couldn't download to Zoombrowser (the Canon software) so I had to clog my computer with the Nikon software (which isn't bad, just don't need 2), which logs all my pictures again.  As said in other posts, the zoom is a bit noisy and slow, and the flash is in an odd spot.  The zoom also doesn't stop immediately.  While you can zoom while videotaping (many other cameras in this category cannot), I do not believe it is 1080 once you zoom.  These aren't deal breakers for me,  I learned to keep my finger in on the side and you can't hear the zoom over screaming kids at sporting events anyway.  The quickness of the autofocus once the zoom stops is outstanding.  There is also a little lag in between shots.  Pick your shot wellMy biggest complaint is the battery life!  Doesn't take much taping to suck it dry, and there is no warning!  Also it has to be charged in the camera.  I am buying a spare so I don't miss anything again.The pictures are clear and crisp, but the clarity and color cannot compete with the SLR, but I am sure it tops other cameras in its category.

I was replacing my Canon SD1000, which I loved.  I wanted a fast point-n-shoot camera.  This camera doesn't fully satisfy my needs and I'm overall a little disappointed.The camera takes great night pictures - I have had great luck at concerts and outdoors with the Night Landscape (more so than the Night Portrait which uses flash). I got some cool pictures of Carlsbad Caverns in NM which are minimally lit. It's also great for taking flashless pictures inside somewhere like an art gallery.  I'm not a photographic expert so I don't know what to call it when the camera enhances photos but it does a great job.I've also played with the Continuous and timer modes to get some amazing full moon pictures.However, issues (for me):- this camera is much bulkier than my Canon. I don't think they are even in the same class so maybe this isn't a fair criticism.  But it doesn't have a flat front profile.  So no putting this camera in the back pocket of tight jeans, which is something I want do often.- lag or hesitation where I try to take a picture quickly but it won't focus and therefore won't take the picture (usually after I just turned it on but sometimes randomly). This has caused me to lose some great shots.- battery must be charged in camera, which means attached to the cord.  WHY?  Why why why do they do this?  I suppose it's to be able to have a USB charger but for me this is really annoying.  For one thing, I like having 2 batteries that I can charge and swap.  And I like not having my camera precariously perched on a hotel window sill whilst charging.- takes pretty crappy pictures in bright sunlight. Once in a while I'll get a winner but more often than not, they look washed out. I've tried tweaking the settings a little bit and choosing various scenes but the pictures just look bad.  I don't want to have to tweak a point-n-shoot.  I want it to take good pictures for me.issue I should have known about:- The screen is amazing but I was so enamored with it that I didn't realize there was no viewfinder.  Consequently, it's very tough to take pictures in the sunlight.  Which I guess is OK because they turn out bad anyway ;-)Finally ... this is probably user-idiocy but I cannot figure out how to view/play images without the lens being engaged.  It's very awkward and I always worry about people touching it when I'm passing the camera around.  Eventually the power settings kick in and the lens retracts, but every other camera I've seen has a PLAY setting that doesn't engage the lens.  What the heck - can anyone give me some help here??I left on a trip after only having the camera for a week and hadn't really road tested it.  So I am stuck with it now.  I do appreciate the night pictures and the 12mp.  And I've played some with the video.  On the cruise I was less worried about packing light and cords and such so I brought both cameras and chose depending on the situation (Nikon at night, Canon on most excursions).  Bottom line is it cannot be my only point-n-shoot camera.  Therefore, it's a loser because carrying 2 cameras around sort of defeats the point of getting this kind of camera in the first place (IMO).

I have had other less expensive 12 megapixel cameras and they were horrible compared to this one. I was a little skeptical at first as to whether or not the video quality was going to be any good at all, but I must say the video quality is way better than anticipated. It's not as good as an actual hi-def camcorder, but for a point and shoot, it is among the best. It has taken excellent photos in both daytime and nighttime shots with authority. I have nothing really bad to say about this camera, except for the fact that it is going to take me some time to get used to the position of the flash. Most cameras have a stationery flash on the front of the body, but this one has a popup flash. I am used to holding the camera with both hands, and when I hold it at the corners, the flash cannot pop up. I will eventually get used to this and it won't happen as often, but this is not a reason to dislike the camera. It is just a nuissance, however, if you manually pop up the flash, this problem can be avoided. I don't know if popping it up manually will damage it or not, so it is up to you to decide.I also recommend getting at least an 8 gigabyte class 10 SDHC memory card. Since this camera is capable of taking 1080p hi-def photos and videos, any lower quality card is a waste of money.

It makes common sense to have the flash elevated in order to alleviate red-eye.My photos are amazing.  I took a photo of the palm tree in my backyard with the 10x optical zoom and it looks 3-D.The start-up is like something from The Green Hornet.The colors are rich and vibrant.If anyone has a complaint about this camera, save that complaint for a camera that someone paid $2,000 because there will be flaws in that camera, too.  No camera is perfect.  There will always be those who look hard enough to find a flaw.  Who cares if Aunt Ida's dress comes out too orange in a photo?  That's nit-picking.And who wants to change a lens on a camera for a close-up?  You will miss out on an important photo with having to change a lens.

It comes with its own rechargeable battery!!  Thats a plus in my book.3. The pictures we have taken so far are so crisp and clear it will blow you away.4. The face recognition system works really well, how did they get it to do that?5. The self timer and smile timer are great when you want a family shot without having to ask people to take your picture.6. The 1080p HD video is records is unbelievable, then plug the camera right into the TV via HDMI and watch video or view pictures.7. There are alot, I mean alot of variables you can do with this camera, but if all your interested in is point and shoot then it does that very well as thats all my wife is interested in. On the other hand I can make it do more complex things.8. The camera seems pretty well built, this is our first nikon, we have always had milnota or kodak in the past...as of now I'll never go back.I thought this camera was very well priced also. The picture quality is amazing!I hope they pay Ashton Kutcher alot for his advertising because thats what lead me to this camera.EDIT: 1-13-2011We took our camera to the colts/jets playoff game and got some great video before the game and some great pictures. The zoom on this is really good, even from the 20 yd line I was able to snap close up pics of the colts on the opposite end of the field. Color is great. Also I noticed no zoom motor noise while watching the video. We also took some shots outside after dark and this camera really excels at night.

I can tell you it is by far the best point and shoot camera I have ever owned or seen.  This is including the cameras my friends have.  All I wanted out of my camera was that it took incredibly clear pictures at day or night with a good zoom.  This camera does just that.  The one thing that impressed me the most was how powerful the flash is. I took a couple of pictures in a pitch black room and they came out just perfect.Not only are the pictures great, but so are the videos.  They definitely do come out in HD quality.  The camera is heavy, but it has that feeling of being heavy for the right reasons.  The one thing I am still getting used to, is to hold it sideways since the flash pops up right where I was used to holding the camera.I read all the reviews on here and there are alot of nitpicky buyers.  Every products will have its small flaws, I am sure this camera has them, but they haven't been any that I had to deal with. Coming from an average user,in other words an average joe, I can tell you this is a great buy. Actually, there is one thing that I wasn't very happy about but its not a big deal, you have to charge the battery inside the camera.  I dont like that since during the charge, you run the risk of leaving the camera unattended and something happening to it.  I would much rather have a charger where I can plug in the battery.All in all, this is a great camera.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.

Excellent features for touch ups right in the camera and cropping.  It contains a quick start-up paper guide and a pdf CD book, which is easy to follow.  I have not tried the included photo CD yet.  I took pictures riding in the car and were clear many times.  This camera is very fast, too.  I have not tried the video mode yet.  It also has date stamp available.It does not have a battery meter until about 20-30 pictures are left on the battery.  The battery takes a long time to charge, but I used the camera right out of the box for the 30 pictures.It may be difficult for someone to use with larger hand because the silver bottom is both a wheel and contains click-able corners.  I do not have issues with my small hands at all.The screen is very large and pictures can be zoomed in on the camera.I would recommend trying features before going to an important event.

(maybe in a few years?)So, I wanted a camera that could deal with low light, shoot fast, start up fast, shoot again fast, and be around 200 bucks. This was the only camera I played with that met the criteria. And the more I play with it, the better it gets.First thing you'll notice - this camera can deal with low-light like no other compact camera. Sure, a DSLR (who's lens would cost more than this camera!) will do a better job... but I managed to get a clear picture at night with no light except for that from a tv on the opposite side of a large room. You can get crisp, beautiful pictures in low lit restaurants without flash (provided little movements on your subjects part) free hand!The fast shooting takes some getting used to. Read the manual, you'll learn a bit about the options (still have to figure what the 16 panel speed shot mode is about). The have some great options that allow you to shoot 1mp at 120 fps, or 12mp at a decent rate. There is even the (very useful) option of a slower continuous shot mode. Great for getting a quick series shot, instead of a burst of shots (good for getting a single shot of a quick moment).The start up time on this is amazing. You can have it up, running and zoomed in all the way in just about a second. Shooting won't take much more time. Recylce time for most modes is a bit slow, but if you leave your camera on continuous mode, you can get that second shot off almost instantly, provided you don't need the flash.The flash is the downside to this camera. At times its a bit bright (so you really have to play with settings). The location makes for awkward shooting (its right where everyone would hold the camera). However, having it raised, and over the lens does reduce red eye. And, if you don't want the flash on (I avoid using it on this camera), holding your finger over the flash means you'll never be surprised by the flash going off unintentionally.The other downside is the video: It does take good video quality, but the mic picks up the zoom and auto focus. If there is a lot of ambient noise, and you're careful about this, you won't notice. They also slowed the zoom speed down (to reduce noise?)... but I would rather have it be noisy and fast, just to have access. You can just not zoom, and lock the AF to fix this problem. Also, the set up for switching between high speed etc is not really intuitive, I'm still working on playing with that.Awesome lay out of buttons: record for video is a hard button that can be used in any mode. You can also shoot stills while recording. I don't know why the nav keys can both spin and be pressed.. I actually find it annoying, but got used to it quickly (now I just don't spin it all). Everything else is pretty standard.The lens protrudes a little, so this 'compact camera' is a bit bulkier (the lens also adds a bit of weight) than its peers, but for 10x zoom and the quality of pictures its a fair trade off.So, over all, best compact camera I've seen ... ever. For this price, I cannot complain. Sure, it has a few things that could be better (more control over continuous burst speed, slow down the shot speed on the 16 shot mode, better video setting controls, maybe put the flash 1/4 of an inch to over) but if they fixed all that, it would probably sell for 400 bucks.... and I'd be tempted to pay that much!", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Coolpix S8100 camera", "Author": "Hamid M.

It captures images from wide angle to super-zoom (35mm equivalent of about 18mm-300mm).  It also captures very good video with stereo sound at 1080p.  It even does 60 fps @ 16x9 for slow motion playback and will shoot up to 240 fps and as slow as 15 fps for fast motion.  It comes with a belt-loop case and travels well. It's maximum f/3.5 aperture and small sensor limit low light performance but the pop-up flash makes up the difference.  Some of the Scene Modes offer shutter drag with flash to capture ambient light but you'll need a very steady hand or tripod to avoid blurring.Compared to a crop sensor DSLR its images lack color depth, richness and detail but for a carry-around camera it does a good job.Now for the negatives:1- A significant number of these cameras freeze with \"LENS ERROR\" messages rendering the cameras dead.  Despite the warranty Nikon is quick to tell the owner that the issue is user error and will try to charge you one hundred dollars for repair.  My first two S8100's died in this manner but were exchanged by the big-box superstore.  My third S8100 has been working for over two years.2- ORANGE- That is the omnipresent tint that affects all of its photos.  It does keep Anglo faces from looking overly pasty by emphasizing orange to warm them up.  Unfortunately it's not a Kodachrome warmth but a carrot-juice look that pervades all images.  The camera can not reproduce a strong red.  Everything is shifted to orange.  My less expensive Nikon L22 Point & Shoot produces much bolder reds and yellows.My primary camera is a Nikon D7000 DSLR with good to pro lenses that gets everything right.  Post processing in Lightroom 5 provides the color control to dial back the orange for more accurate color balance.  Control is limited, however, because the camera does not offer RAW image capture.Bottom line- Better than my HTC1 cell phone, excellent video, great zoom range and easy to carry but suffers from an orange cast on all images requiring correction in post processing.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible camera", "Author": "WC Williams \"WCW\"", "ReviewID": "RNZ83AAG5OURH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The flash has to pop up to work, and half the time your finger will be on top of the flash to take pictures.

About a year ago I did notice that some of the pictures that I took were out of focus. Not being a complainer, I found that if I turned the camera off and then back on again the problem would clear up. About 3 months ago  the camera began over-exposing pictures on the automatic setting.. I'd take a picture and it would be totally over-exposed. I'd wait. Change nothing. Take another picture and it would be ok...This began to occur more frequently so I sent Nikon an email. They responded and told me to reset it back to the original factory settings. I did but the problem wasn't corrected. Just within the past 2 weeks I went to a concert and really used the zoom feature a lot.. After continued use it beagn to make a funny noise. (Please keep in mind that up to this point I hardly ever used this camera). The next day after the concert, I recharged the camera and turned it on and got a lens error message. The lens wouldn't extend. I came to the conclusion that the motor that operates the lens must have burnt out so I notified Nikon. My extended warranty was still good so I shipped the camera off to Nikon. In a few days they sent me back an email stating that the camera had back and front end damage and that it therefore wasn't covered under their warranty. Now I never dropped the camera. It was still working when I left the concert (I'm 65 and I am very responsible). I had to stop taking pictures because the battery needed to be recharged. I wouldn't buy another Nikon because of the above issues and if you decide to do so I recommend that you buy the other extended warranty(Square Trade) offered here which isn't through Nikon. I might add in closing that i have never sent in a review before to Amazon, however i felt that in this case I needed to alert others regarding Nikon.

It feels great in my XL hands. The finish feels like it is rubberized or something. There is a thumb grip in the upper right hand corner to help not drop it. Dropping cameras is bad. That is why the instructions tell you to PUT THE STRAP ON YOUR CAMERA. IT'S FREE. DROPPING YOUR AXE IS NOT FREE!  (It came with a free small camera case in the package. BUT, it has a magnetic clasp. I NEVER allow magnets to come anywhere near my digital electronic gear.I suggest you do not either. My son was playing with a magnet and tried to stick it on the front of our Jenn Air stove. It erased the code in the circuitboard causing a $250 repair.)  Of course I love the 1080 video shooting, but it eats up alot of memory, so you will need a SDHC card or two. I'm using a 16GB Class 10 card.and I don't shoot much video.Besides, 720p video is plenty of resolution for me. 12 mp pictures will not fill up alot of space compared to 1080 video, so if you don't shoot video, the 4 GB card that came with it should be sufficient. In VIDEO mode the ZOOM is very gentle, like at 1/4 regular speed.The motor noise is hardly noticable. Some people want to complain about the noise. Hey Guys, The thing has a MOTOR that works the zoom.It isnt that loud. It makes you look like a PRO Videographer.  This camera does great with the flash off of grabbing the image better and with more detail than you can see with your eyes. I haven't done many people shots with flash yet , so I cannot comment of reports of the flash washing out subjects.If it washes out, Move Back,and Zoom In a little to Compensate.Photography has always been about compensating and adjusting. I have determined that if you use this camera in flash mode, you have to remember to open the flash before you shoot by depressing the shutter halfway, WHICH YOU SHOULD DO ANYWAY TO SET THE FOCUS. Once the flash is open, it's easy to remember where not to place your finger and cover the flash.Sometimes it is slow to focus in real dark scenes.If it cant focus it flashes a red parentheses around the subject and doesnt shoot.When it figures out the range the parentheses turns green.  The zoom is great, and the auto focus works better than any point and shoot that I've seen.  I love the great, awesome 3 inch 921,000 dot high resolution screen. So detailed as you review your work, I can even see how good my pictures are without having to use my laptop.BEFORE I removed the protective film on the screen, I used some Xylol with a Q tip to rub the lettering off, and left the film on. It didn't hurt anything, and left the protective film on the screen,quite invisible.  I was able to drag the manual off the CD ROM into a new file on my desktop, so I don't have to use the CD to read it. It wasn't hard to do, even for a non-techie.  The VIDEO EDITING  software that comes with it is very good.  Battery life seems to be very good as I have been using it. I bought an external charger with two batteries off EBAY for $10. so I can charge a battery without it being in the camera, which seems to be an issue with some users.I read some negative reviews about the service dept. and am optimistic that I won't be one that has to go that route.  Bottom line is I AM VERY HAPPY with this camera.The only thing I don't like is the case with the magnetic clasp. THROW THE CASE AWAY.

After 6 months of light to medium use, the flash stopped firing and the focus mechanism stopped working almost completely. This resulted in such a drastic reduction in photo quality (from \"thrilled\" to \"nigh-unusable\") that I shelved it, and started using my 6 year old basic Casio point and shoot (which took decent quality pictures, and much, much better photos than after the flash/focus problems).I had heard only good things about Canon, and nearly all of my family members use them, but wanted to try a Nikon, for whatever reason. I was not thrilled with my investment, in that 6 months after my purchase, all of my family members are still taking beautiful photos with their cameras and I'm spending another Black Friday weekend looking for a good camera deal.I've sent the camera into Nikon for repair as a last effort, but the opinions that I've heard in person and online don't bode well for the camera being fixed for a reasonable amount of money (despite falling within the 1 year manufacturer warranty). I will update this review if it is found otherwise.I won't be buying another Nikon anytime soon, and will likely join the Canon bandwagon.

It takes low-light pictures very well. It turns on fast, and takes pictures fast; though i wish it had an infinity focus option. I also wish it had an exposure time setting like Kodak cameras. Regardless of which, it still takes pictures with really good quality even in low light. The pop-up flash is very cool and fancy. The video recording is great with great sound. I like the ability to zoom in while recording, I just wish it would have better focus while zooming, but I won't complain too much on that. I also wish there was an infinity focus option for video recording. The zoom is amazing on this camera. I can see things I can't even see with my own eyes. The slow motion feature is also very cool. It slows down what you've captured but you don't lose any frames per second on the video you watch. It looks just like a normal recording, but slowed down. The camera is a little thick though, but I'm sure that was necessary to incorporate the 10x zoom. The screen is also very clear. I call this a semi-professional camera, because it seems like it is between a point-and-shoot and an SLR.

It's everything it promises. Very thin and light. Great telescoping lense, big viewing screen, compensates beautifully for movement and has easy to understand settings. I love how easily I can switch from stills to movie mode. Be aware it does NOT come with a removeable memory card. Though the internal memory did allow me to take 22 pictures and a 15 second video before running out of space, so there's plenty of room to try it out before investing in a memory card. As with any small camera, holding it without interfering with flash etc. takes a little practice for those of us used to larger cameras. But the grip bars on the front of this model help. A buying tip: If you are attracted to the latest, greatest model in a line of cameras but it's beyond the budget or has more features than you know you need, check out earlier versions of that model. Not only will the price be better, but you might find the earlier model still has all the features you want.

Maybe", "Author": "dikw", "ReviewID": "R38HXRTLOLBCZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon S8100This camera is a pleasure to review and I can't say enough to describe what a superb instrument it is to use.  As kind of a hobby, and to get out of the house for a little exercise for my 78 year old frame, I go to a number of stores to shop on a daily basis, mostly 7 days per week.  This explains why I can say I traveled to at least 15 stores over several months to demonstrate, test and fondle, easily, 50 cameras.  I narrowed the choices between the following; Olympus VR2, Sony''', Samsung\"\"\", Nikon S8100, Cannon'''. (And that was the narrowed part)The Olympus had all the right specs...great very wide and long angle telephoto lens....it didn't feel particularly sturdy, the screen images were not crisp as I thought they should be, too many negative write-ups by people that were expert in the field (which I am not). Good price....came close on this one.  Sony had great (most important to me) wide angle lens, good telephoto and the very great sweep panorama feature, pretty good screen images, BUT I was astounded how cheap and toy-like the unit felt to me in my hand......maybe because it is all plastic......anyway, I could not get passed it.  I thought not having the great very wide angle lens and the sweep panorama was ending my photography career.. I was wrong.  I liked the Samsung touch screen a lot but I have been hearing about far too many problems with touch screen camera so this one went down the tube after a short short.  The Cannon was OK but lacked some of the items of interest...so I passed on it...Then came the S8100 Nikon ; Built like a brick, ...it appears it would survive a truck driving over it.....all metal, but light enough and sized right to slip into a shirt pocket. You will know it is there, but it is not bothersome. Attractive and nicely finished, plus the weight and heft in general is perfect for me as it lets me know I have something in my hand that I can control.  The lens and screen are clear as a bell, the telescopic movement is swift, the video is marvelously simple to start and stop, viewing the video is clear and the sound is super.....The panorama assist is great and provides a better scene than the sweep panoramas I tested.....the panorama photos are flawlessly stitched and consistent due in part to the Panorama 5 software that comes with the camera.....Low light shots were surprisingly clear and sharp as well.........Some of the picky reviews I read tells me these guys are clueless operators or have a malfunctioning unit (It happens to the best)I admit it took me some head-scratching to understand both of the photo programs that arrived in the camera box for loading into the computer.....I got it now though........I was also perplexed at the menu manipulation and understanding what the camera was telling me it could do.....once the light went off in the brain it became a very simple task; however; I did think that all was lost the first time around...Now as I operate everything I can't understand what it was that was so complicated for me.....I printed out the online manual which yielded 204 pages....this should give you an idea of the capabilities of the camera....The manual is excellent and well constructed.....SO in the end, would I buy again?....Absolutely.  My mechanically deficient wife is using it so much that I believe I will have to get another for myself...hard to go wrong with this machine......I hope this long winded review was of some help.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon S8100", "Author": "G.

around my big stuff for once during vacations and so on. I researched a ton of cameras and read reviews and here it is:TWO WORST THINGS ABOUT IT:1. If you keep the movie focus mode on AF-S you won't hear a clicking noise in the video, but it also won't auto focus as it should once you get to a certain close distance and beyond. You HAVE to put it on AF-continous to get the auto focus movie feature, but there is a terrible clicking noise that is also continuous while it finds focus all the way though your footage. At first I hoped that I was only hearing it from outside the camera and that it wouldn't pick up on the actual video...WRONG! It's worse on the video than just hearing it while you shoot! I don't just mean that it's a little quite click every now and then...I mean a clicking that you absolutely can't ignore and is totally audible in your footage. THIS IS WHY I SENT IT BACK...THE ONE AND ONLY REASON. **Believe it or not, I found in the manual (which isn't a booklet version, but PDF only) that Nikon actually states in the manual that you will hear a clicking noise while the mode is in AF-continuous! Really????? Yes, really. I guess they had to put that because you simply can't ignore the fact that it does it! I've been a pro Nikon user for 9 years and this is the first time I've been disappointed in them, I'm sad to say. Wish their point and shoots were as good as their SLRs! WATCH THE VIDEO! This is how much I feel everyone should hear it. It's short and it's random, but you can't miss the clicking noise!2. The flash definitely is in the most random spot...directly under your finger. Think you don't hold the camera there and it won't be an issue? I doubt it. I kept trying to remember that it was there and hold it differently, but it is rather annoying every time it pops up under where you're holding it. Honestly, I still would have kept the camera if this were the only thing wrong with it. I could get past the bad placement of the flash, but I simply could not get past or ignore the continual, loud clicking in my videos.Everything else about the camera I really liked! The images were sharp even in low light and the video would have been fine (not as great in low light as you'll see in the sample video) if it hadn't been for the above issues.If you don't mind the clicking or won't be doing much video, it may be worth it to you, but check out the video and decide for yourself./Applications/Nikon Software", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "Weekend mechanic", "ReviewID": "R3T99PE3CYKNIN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wouldn't it would be great to have a compact camera that could to shoot both high quality still photos along with 1080p HD video. Up until recently that camera didn't exist, but there are several cameras on the market now that will do just that. What I like best about the S8100 is the super sharp, easy to see outdoors, 3\" LCD Display along with the 10X Zoom lens. I recently attended a Winter Carnival in my home town, the temperture was in the mid 20's and I shot video's and still pictures of Ice sculptors working on their creations. In addition, there were snowmobile races I recorded video of. When I returned home I combined the video segments into a HD mini movie with sound, using the software included with the camera. I was impressed with how sharp the picture was when I played it on my HD TV. The camera does have it's faults. As other's have mentioned the pop up flash is located under where many people would place the index finger of their left hand. It's not that difficult to move your finger back a little and if you forget, the camera will let you know. I suppose the reason is to try and locate the flash as far from the lens as possible to minimize Red Eye. The Wheel on the top of the camera that allows you to select various shooting modes is diffucult to get a hold of as about 2/3 of it is only partially exposed. On the positive side, the camera can be used on fully automatic or you can chose from a number of shooting modes programed for various lighting situations. All in all I think this is a great little camera to take on vacation or use for family events as it's small and easy to carry.

So granted that I am yet to fully explore all the features and knobs on the camera and I am no expert when it comes to adjusting settings on cameras i.e DSLRs are too costly to experiment for my budget; this one had met all my criteria when I bought it. Thus far I have only used the basic picture and video recording functions on the camera. Here are my reactions:Wrt pictures: Mixed. Some have turned out to be awesome and some leave the crispness that you'd expect out of a Nikon 12.1MP camera to be desired. Like I stated above - do not know as yet if I could control that by changing some settings..WIP. Night pictures, if the flash is on and if taken with patience - turn out nice.Wrt video: While the 1080p quality is amazing - any zoom in/out during recording causes the video to break into the obviously noticeable frames i.e the continuity of the video is broken. I have seen that with all the videos that I recorded and uploaded and watched on my computer. I still need to check if I witness that same behavior if I connect the camera directly to my HDTV (probably will?).

Some times the camera reacts very slowly and take a few seconds to either focus or even take the picture.I sold my Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 because I was looking for a camera that took 1080p Video but guess what? Even when the Panasonic was only 720p, it is a much better camera than Nikon so if you are a Nikon fan you need to be patient to take great pictures, just wait for the camera to focus and shoot. It can take great pictures with low or no light but you need a tripod and when taking pictures to people, you will have to ask them to stand still for 10 seconds!Something that I didn't like from this camera at all is that the zoom lens motor is noisy and when you are taking a video with low or no sound at all, the camera will record that noise coming from the lens when you're zooming!I've read most of the reviews and my main advise is: Read the manual to learn the main tricks about how to use this camera properly.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "fine little camera", "Author": "Terry McCammon", "ReviewID": "R6PQFHOAD9WBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I selected this as a gift for my wife based on size, performance and reputation.

Only drawback is a little noise when zooming in video mode(you can hear it in the playback). Records in stereo when shooting video. Picture quality is great & almost no lapse from picture to picture (very fast between shots). The flash was a little getting used to. It pops up on top  & thats where I like to keep my fingers. Video connects directly to HD TV with patch cord(not supplied). I bought a 8GB card for this camera(about 2400 pics.). An extra battery is about $24, allot less than $50 for my Casio battery. About 200 pictures between charging battery. USB downloads pictures & videos to computer. Comes with Nikon programs you download. I find it's easier to use my own reader to download all.

As compared to other point and shoot cameras, the quality and detail is hands down better. This is probably due to the actual number of lenses and distance the lenses are able to extend from the camera itself.While reviewing the camera prior to purchase, I noted other people mentioned the placement of the flash.  I too would have to agree it is annoying and I often forget to move my fingers as I am not quite used to its location.  With that being said, the quality of pictures taken with the flash down are so that a little color/contrast editing bring the pictures back to top quality (sometimes better than other P&S; cameras with a flash).  This also has some bearing on the night or low light pictures taken with the S8100.  No issues in this department.  Although, if Nikon decides to add a night vision capability to this camera, sign me up.The LCD is crisp and clear but is mounted flush.  Being in the military and deployed, this bothers me as I have to continually make a conscious effort to keep the screen from being damaged.  The internal memory is descent with about 50 pictures worth of space.  Not sure how much video space that is as I have not taken any video yet (therefore have not rated the video in this review).As of this writing I have only had the camera for about three weeks.

Naturally I could have done better with the video if I had a tripod available, but for a \"try it now\" situation, hand held, the results were amazing. Video inside a fairly well illuminated room, with windows as a background and no alternate position from which to shoot - everyone who viewed the results was amazed. Photos, both with and without flash were great as well. BATTERY LIFE was really great since I shot over 35 minutes of video and 225 high-resolution photos and still had no sign of  the battery being severely diminished.There are certainly cameras with more advanced features, however, for a good solid camera with easy to use top-mounted controls, this is a great buy.The one \"con\"?

It replaced and Olympus 3.1 megapixel camera that still worked adequately.  Once I got used to not holding my finger where the pop-up flash pops out, I didn't find anything too objectionable about the camera.  It is wonderful for still photos.  I use it for work and wanted something compact, but substantial enough for my hand to firmly grasp.  It comes in a bit on the small side, with no real grip.  The Olympus it replaced was more substantial.Prior to buying, I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and possibly other places.  I've had the camere for a year and used it a lot.  Battery life has been fine.  I don't remember it ever running low, even after taking several flash photos.  I don't use it for more than 20 pictures at a time on average, and it gets plugged in to download the pictures often.  My opinion is that picture quality is tremendous.For video, I am sure you can hear the lens zooming in the audio, but I didn't purchase the camera for video, and what video I've taken, I am pleased with.  The sound was also good when recording my 87 year old mother playing the piano she sent to us from her home.  Low light photos (and I believe video) by candle light came out nicely.The camera came as part of a kit with a tight fitting elastic case.  The case is small and protects it really well from scratches.  It has elastic that stretches to accept the camera and get it back out.  The case also has a velcro flap.  The simple case is wonderful.  I highly recommend such.  The old Olympus I had got scratched by the plug on a battery charger that was also in a bigger bag with it.The lcd display is big, bright, and clear.  I wish the cameras still came with a range finder viewer.SLRs are a big thing now, but having been an amateur photographer and blessed to lug around a Hasselblad about 20 years ago as well as Olympus SLRs, I appreciate the compact simplicity and high quality of a camera like this.  Digital is incredible.  I don't miss going into the darkroom to develop things, and I don't need a whole bunch of lenses or a bulky SLRs to take great pictures.  Being able to shoot and shoot and shoot and not spend for film is great for developing your eye for photos.  I never got great at that, but on a trip with the Olympus digital camera was able to take about 1,000 pictures, and for the first time, I saw how I was getting better at seeing things and really seeing the picture I was taking as well as thinking about what I was really getting.  Being unencumbered is freeing, and this camera can free you to be creative with your eyes and mind.If video is extremely important, I recommend investing in a camera just for that, but if amateur home movie type video is plenty good (a bit shaky, with a little whirring from the zoom lens), then the quality of the video from this is wonderful (HD looks gread on the computer).  A tripod helps with shake.  Sound from the zoom lens probably cannot be avoided.You get what you pay for and for the price, I am really happy and give it a full 5 stars.The particular vendor mine came from sent me a gold one twice, when I thought I'd ordered black.  It was very frustrating to deal with that two times, but finally they got it right.  I don't think they were an Amazon vendor.

I took one to China with me in 2010 for a short Thanksgiving trip. I loved the 12x zoom and image stabilization for taking the corners of buildings like the Forbidden Palace. The short videos were excellent quality and meant I didn't need to lug my video camera along.In 2011, I returned for a 45 day trip. Before leaving, I had some trouble with the lens cover closing, probably because of dirt. My more mechanical wife managed to get it closed and I left with the camera. Some time in this process the camera got scratched and glare spots appeared on pictures where light hit the lens. I looked into getting it repaired in China but the prices approached those of a new  camera and the expert shops said they couldn't get the part since it was made for the American market. I limped a long with the camera, taking once in a lifetime pictures with a lens that made it look like the camera had a cataract. I was meeting up with friends in Guangdong so I had my wife buy another of the same model. Once I got it, everything went great for the remainder of the trip. I was very pleased with the results.I went to New Mexico for New Year's. The camera served me well for about 2/3 of the trip, but then the lens started to not close and the display showed a lens error. I can get it to reclose by taking the battery out and in, saying voodoo and sometimes, out of desperation, pushing the lens physically.I haven't dropped or mistreated the cameras, as far as I know. The mechanism does seem very sensitive to dust. I have had a few Canon point and shoots that still operate fine and have never given me any problem. I know Nikon has a reputation for doing better in low light; I found that wasn't the case unless I used the night setting or museum (too slow for children). When it worked, I loved the S8100. However, I can't go halfway around the world and lose priceless memories to a camera that somehow easily gets scratched or won't operate without doing voodoo. I am looking for another megazoom; it will probably be a Canon. I know it won't be a Nikon.

The shots out of this rival in color and sharpness that of my DSLR (when the dslr is shooting in .jpg format), unfortunately when shooting against a dslr  with this in .jpg and the dslr shooting .raw, this still won't touch a dslr BUT this probably has the best looking point and shoot photos i've seen across many brands (sony, kodak, pentax, canon, and olympus).  Unfortunately this camera seriously lacks in one major category that is important to certain people..its continuous shooting mode.The continuous shooting mode is as fast as they describe, but the flaw is that it doesn't work like other cameras.  With other cameras you hold down the button and it starts shooting (at whatever its shooting speed is such as 2.5fps) and doesn't stop until you release the button. With this camera it is much different, you hit the button once and it shoots 5 incredibly fast frames, then the whole camera locks itself up for 30seconds or so while it tries to process those images.  Its awful.  We tried to shoot various live action sports with it and it does its 5 shots in the first second or so of pushing the button, then we are stuck again for another minute, at which point if we didn't get the shot in the first 5 shots, your screwed.  I've had many cameras and this is by far the ABSOLUTE WORST implementation of continuous shooting I have ever seen.  It would be better have a slower FPS that sits and shoots 1 frame/second (like my old cannon p&s;) but a least you can hold it down for an entire sports sequence and hopefully get some of the action.BOTTOM LINE: BEAUTIFUL PICTURES AND GREAT FOR STILLS, BUT IF YOU PLAN ON TRYING TO SHOOT ANY MOVING OBJECTS FORGET ABOUT THIS CAMERA.Oh, of note, the 'so called' manual settings on this camera are very poor.  this is somewhat of a neutral thing because some people love them and others hate them.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pics", "Author": "joevinnie", "ReviewID": "R20XWCYVSSCV95", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Nikon 8100.

I experimented a bit with the different megapixel settings and different built in scene settings.  To be honest, I never see a huge difference, but changing the settings is easy to master.  The menus are intuitive.  The transfer software is easy to use.  All in all, I am happy with the choice.You do have to get used to the flash popping up and putting it back down.  Not a big deal.  I like that there is a good spot for your right thumb at top of back where you are not accidentally hitting buttons.  This was definitely a problem with some Canons I looked at in the store.  It is a bit heavier and larger than back pocket size (which is where my old Canon lived at most events), but that's the tradeoff for better zoom and lens.The video quality is not exceptional but acceptable.

The main features that I wish this camera had was the ability to use manual aperture and shutter speed settings, or at least an aperture and shutter speed priority setting.  It would also be nice to shoot in RAW mode, but hey... this is a point-&-shoot!I worked with her on improving image composition (using the Rule of Thirds and the use of leading lines, symmetrical and asymetrical balance in her photos... she learned FAST!  She also loves the video mode!  I explained to her about how to use exposure compensation... she's got it down pat!  After we returned the other evening, I went over the images she shot. She did very well, but is still learning.  I discovered that image sharpness on this model is partially dependent on her optical zoom setting.

I have Nikon DSLRs but wanted something that was small enough to fit in a pocket with good image quality.I would not compare IQ to any DSLR but it comes close enough for me in the sharpness category. Dead center is spot on sharp with some softness in the corners. I am completely happy with that since I use the DSLR for serious shots. The zoom is quite good and tops out at 300mm 35mm equiv. Startup time is fairly quick for its class. The ED lens helps with chromatic abberations seen with most cameras at this level. I took many shots with this camera and 90 percent came out without any post editing work needed. The meter is good, the screen is awesome and the form factor is a great fit for my hand and my wife's. The Canon-like control dial on the back is nice too. It rotates nicely to move through menus.The video is wicked cool for such a small device. I don't use it much but it works well. We had a Canon SD1400 IS that I got rid of because it was too small and the IQ was horrible. It might be fine for drunk college girls but not for vacation use.What I would like to see in this camera:Apeture Priority, Shutter Priority and RAW NEF. And maybe a Manual mode. Regardless, the Auto setting does a great job. The nightshot scene setting is ok. It seems to really bump up the ISO so it gets a bit grainy. Use a tripod for good results.Everyone seems to complain about the flash position on this camera. I found it odd at first but just learned to not put my hand over the flash area.

It's not quite as fast as I would have liked but if your a casual shooter then this is perfect.  The video quality is also very good, catches the sound pretty good too.  Haven't tried the HDMI out yet though (sorry folks)...The camera handles well in low light situations and there are enough controls that you can get the right effect if you want and take the time to learn and experiment.The casing is good quality and handles well. The camera is a little on the heavier side but that because it's quality baby!! The only part I don't like is the flash is placed in a position where your finger would intuitively hold the camera...VERY ANNOYING.  It's one of those pop-up flashes (like are you serious?).

A couple of years ago I bought a small point-and-shoot (S230) which worked very well when outdoors in good light and was very, very portable, fitting easily into any pocket I had. However, I was unhappy with pictures taken in low-light. Even when I kept the ISO from climbing above 200 and held the camera reasonably steady, low-light pics were usually fairly grainy and/or blurred somewhat due to motion. So when the S8100 came along I decided to try it and am very glad that I did. Performance is exceptional compared to my earlier point-and-shoot (although the sensor size is identical), daylight pics are great, and the low-light problems that I was experiencing with the older S230 have disappeared. The compromise is that it is a little larger but still fits into the front pocket of my Levis (it will fit in my shirt pocket also, but its weight makes it a little uncomfortable there). Although I am primarily a still photographer, I have tried the video on several occasions and find that works well also. It all depends what you're looking for, of course, but if you want something that takes very, very good pictures but for whatever reason you can't handle the weight and size of the DLSR, this camera is an excellent compromise.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my new nikon coolpix s8100", "Author": "stedder", "ReviewID": "R2RMKG68HQCCRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love this camera, its easy to use and takes awesome pictures !

The low light shooting is great for a point & shoot.  You just need to learn about the camera and what the different scenes and adjustments do.  The LCD screen is one of the best I have ever seen and is of high quality.The 10x zoom is very good although I would like to have seen from a 12 to 15, but then the picture quality may have suffered.  The build quality is great !  It feels like a high end camera and doesn't have that cheap plastic feel.  I also like the fact it has a HDMI port.The video is very good although not great.  The biggest problem with the video is that you can hear the noise of the zoom when you zoom in & out during video shooting.  It's not a deal breaker and it's not that bad, but just be aware that you can hear the zoom.  The other 2 things that I'm not happy with, is the charging system and no manual mode.There are plenty of adjustments to get great pictures and I guess if you want more adjustments then maybe you should think about a DSLR.  The charging system means you have to leave the battery in the camera to charge it.  Why Nikon didn't include a stand a lone charger with this camera is beyond me. But I found a charger with a car adapter and a 2nd Nikon battery for only $26 here on Amazon so that takes care of that.I've read where some were having problems with blurry pictures...........I have had no problems with that at all !  Again, the picture quality is fantastic for a compact point & shoot !It starts up quick and is very quick between shots.  Which is a result of the CMOS sensor it has which is also why it is good in low light conditions.I highly recommend this camera if you are looking for a point & shoot that takes fantastic pictures, and has pretty good video capabilities with a good zoom, and is well built that will fit in your pocket.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Remarkable low-light performance", "Author": "Frederick Koehler \"Causual Kite Flyer\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q9FED6QKXNEC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, so good.

It is really nice and pretty compact for the amount of zoom it offers. It is also really quick (start up and shutter speed). It takes excellent pictures and the video quality is really stunning. Uploading them to the computer is a breeze too. The black is a matte color and personally I like the feel and look. It doesn't show finger prints all over it due to there being no glossy areas to put your fingers on other than the screen. I couldn't find a camera case to fit it (I read in quite a few places that most places, even Nikon, adverstising that their case fit the S8100 when it actually didnt). So I went to Best Buy, only because I had a coupon!, and bought a lowepro case designed for larger cameras and it fit perfectly with room leftover for my memory cards and USB cable.One of my biggest concerns in the flash on the camera. It flips up, but it is in a spot where you put your left index finger, so it takes some time to get used to leaving your index finger just barely on the camera. But other than that, its wonderful.For those who want a slim and easy to carry camera, this isn't particularly the one you should look at since it is slightly larger volume wise.

Blur blur blur blur blur.  I've gotten used to grainy pictures in dimily lit rooms (and ironically this camera does a wonderful job at improving that, so that it's usually a non-issue.)

Don't care how good the pictures are when you use the camera in the sun.  I cherish all shots in all locations at all times, and the camera's inability to take even relatively-clear pictures has made the camera useless to me.FYI: I've read reviews that some were able to pseudo-compensate via manual controls, but when the moment is there, you want to capture it quick...right?

I'm an aspiring/learning photographer, and I don't have the money to get a bigger or more professional camera, so I have to settle for digital point-and-shoots. I try not to be nit-picky about the camera, but there are instances where the quirks and defects really get on my last nerve.At first, the camera was okay, but within the first week, I noticed some problems; one was the focusing in the video. I was filming horses at the WA State Horse Expo and the camera's focus was going berserk, the blur getting so bad that you couldn't make out anything. Also, if I play the video back, I can hear an irate, intense clicking or ticking sound INSIDE the camera, and it gets so loud, you can barely here anything going on in the video itself.As far as taking pictures, it's okay, I suppose. The quality is fine, but again some focus issues interfere every now and then, often for no reason at all. I've lost count how many times I've tried to capture macro shots of flowers or even spiders, and the shot would always be blurry and out of focus, and here I'd be pointing my camera only centimeters away from a bug or spider, and it still wouldn't focus, even with the lens being clean!In the advertisements on TV, the camera is hailed as working so well in low light, no flash is necessary; oh sure, if you hold the camera impossibly, inhumanly still, the picture will turn out okay in low-light, but 99% of the time, the picture will be deluded with glows and shaky blurs. No matter what format you put the camera in, there are some things that are IMPOSSIBLE to take clear pictures of--such as anything in an arena or any other such enclosure, anything in low-light, anything moving too fast, the moon or any nighttime photography, and don't even get me started on fireworks! Even in the \"Fireworks\" format, the pictures turn out like crap; the shutter speed is nowhere near fast enough to catch an exploding firework without distorting it and making it look ridiculous (though I will admit, despite the distortion and messiness, I've had some interesting and almost cool pictures come out of trying to capture fireworks). Oh, another thing this camera was praised for was its high-zoom ability. Yeah, it can zoom in quite a ways, but at a certain point, the picture becomes awfully grainy and pixelated. I wasn't too pleased when the pictures I took of some distant bull elk turned out blurry and grainy because I zoomed in as close as I could.The good things about this camera? It's relatively easy to use. Although it isn't very dynamic to meet a photographer's needs, it does take decent pictures. There are times the camera even surprises me; I've managed to take some good pictures of sunsets and structures even from a moving car (as long as it wasn't at night and the window was clean or down). I suppose it's an alright camera for someone who isn't into photography as a hobby, but all-in-all, it's just a dud.

With this camera, I feel I have to because it is very bad.One reason I purchased this camera was its price and features (if they ever worked).  Second of all, I own a Nikon D90 for about 3 years and love it.  I figured I shall get a smaller one for the family so they can carry it and take pictures anywhere.  But I was very disappointed.The color reproduction was very bad, especially in low light condition with the flash on.  I needed to reduce the exposure 3 steps in order to reduce white out condition.  The colors in both the still pictures and video were not good at all.  The blue hue always seemed to be missing.The other problem was the mechanical lense.  Sometimes the camera would not focus.  \"Lense Error\" started occurring a couple months after we bought it.  The lense would jam at the extended position.  We had to shut down the camera and let it recycle itself to retract the lense.  The frequency of this failure started to increase as time went by.  Ten months later, the lense refused to retract and permanently stuck in the full extend position.

It is pretty annoying and I'm thinking that pretty soon the flash is going to fall off the camera or break.2) I did not realize soon enough that this camera does not have the option to take black/white pictures or much less sepia, or any other tones.

Second, it doesn't come with a separate battery charger, so, if you have a spare battery, you have to use the camera to charge it, which is not as convenient.6) It labels videos as \"images\" so that when you want to replay or delete them, it's confusing, and you might accidentally delete a video thinking it's an image.7) There is no battery bar on the screen nor in the menu, I've yet to see it after using this cam many times. It doesn't even give you a numerical percentage anywhere. All you get is a fleeting warning before the battery dies. I'm guessing they did this on purpose so people wouldn't realize what a battery hog this thing is.8) As for \"plenty of options\", a cheap FUJI cam had more options than this thing. It didn't have white balance meter, but still much more versatile than this thing.9) The resolution at high zoom and ability to take pictures in low light is excellent, BUT, unfortunately, if you want a clear picture in low light, you have to hold it pretty still, so the image stabilization is still weak. Also, it uses a high powered light to gauge the target apparently, so it's not stealthy.

And when u record video in low light, it makes a movie shutter sound, which can lead to it breaking bcuz I hit it  repeatedly thinking something was jammed.11) Garbage autofocus in video mode, I think pressing the take a photo button brings it in to focus though, sorry I forgot the name of that thing, strange, I know.If they worked these problems out, gave it 30 more minutes of life, and gave it an infrared or radio remote, this would be a great camera, sadly though, I can only recommend it as a great starting camera for kids, or as a high resolution backup camera with video capability.As for the kit, Cameta ripped me off: the little tripod reeks this nasty WD40 smell I've smelt in many cheap electronics which causes headaches and nausea, STRONG nausea, the cheap secondary battery died in days, and they wouldn't give me a return shipping label. If u can get this kit cheap, or camera, like for $170, then yeah u have yourself a deal.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Video Was Choppy & Buggy on my XP PC's", "Author": "Jay-T", "ReviewID": "R2VSJMNVKGMU6U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this camera - the still picture quality was excellent- but unfortunately I couldn't get the video to display correctly on my PC's. I run Windows XP on both and maybe it is on my end- but after waiting for 3 weeks for an answer from Nikon's Tech Support (with no solution) I returned my Nikon S8100 for another brand. The HD video now runs fine on both my PC's using a different camera brand. Another downer was the flash popping up right where my left finger was holding the camera. I got used to it quickly- but whenever I handed the camera to someone else to take our picture the flash always got blocked down my their left finger- even after I warned them...I hope the camera works out for others!Cheers", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very bad picture quality", "Author": "Sanjay S.

I did extensive comparison photo shoot and was surprised that consistently my old Kodak photos came out clearly superior to Nikon's S8100 in terms of image sharpness and color.  Nikon images were blurry in comparison, the colors were either washed out or unrealistically bright when flash was used. (by the way, the flash is most inconveniently placed). The night photos were totally unacceptable - all blurry.  The camera is cheaply made - the USB rubber port cover does not stay in place and is ready to fall off all together. I must say I was extremely disappointed with this product and Nikon. Of course I returned the camera, and I don't think I will consider buying a Nikon any time soon.
