photograph.  I like taking photos of family gatherings and holidays, parties and picnics and also of nature and animals. I use a Canon 7D a lot but when you are out and moving it means you have a lot of things to carry around.  This is a great point and shoot camera and it does everything you need it to do to take good photographs quickly and easily. It fits into your pocket and it only weighs 5 1/4 ounces.  This camera is extremely powerful and has many features in it. I put together a video (I am sorry that it is so long) that covers only a few of the key features, such as:* 16 Megapixel camera* Shoots photos and videos* You can shoot 720P video* Simple one button access to take a video.* Able to zoom in on a subject in a video* Takes fast and easy photos* 5 times optical zoom and 10 times Super resolution zoom and 20 times digital/optical zoom when combined* Small and light weight construction but solidly built* Image stabilization built in to eliminate hand and body motions and allow you to take better photos and videos* Nice 3 inch LCD color display with great resolution and clarity 460,800pixels*  Good sound on the movies and very good resolution and video quality* Smart Auto AI that selects one of 16 preset shooting settings to take the right photos based on the conditions the camera sees.* Very nice AC wall battery charger that operates on 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz for international use and it is UL approved. Don't forget to take your wall plug adapters.* It has a very bright flash and it can be twice as bright as similarly lower priced cameras.Some weaknesses are:* No optical view finder and you have to use the LCD display in all viewing conditions.* I would have preferred a rocker switch for the zoom control* you will have to buy a camera case* You will have to buy a memory SD card to use and neither the manual nor the Olympus web site provides any details on what speed of memory to get.  I recommend a class 6 to a class 10 card with 32 GIG capacity.What's in the box?* CD disk with software and the complete instruction manual* Quick startup guide* Power cable to charge the camera* The internal lithium battery ratted at 1320 mAh capacity* A lanyard* An AC wall Adapter* The camera* The warranty cardWhat I liked was the ease of use without having to do a dozen settings to get a reasonable photo.  If you want to take good photos and not have to learn to be a camera expert this is a good camera for you.  The autofocus is easy to use and it is ready quickly to take some great photos.I loved that it came with a lanyard as with my huge hands I was afraid that I would drop it all the time.This is good solid camera.  I rate it as a 5 star item.I received a sample product for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great point & shoot camera that practically does the work for you ...", "Author": "D. Fowler", "ReviewID": "R1SS9CIP3A218Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a photographer, not even close. I do however need a decent point-and-shoot camera that will practically do the work for me. Perhaps you can label me lazy when it comes to reading directions, but there are a few other reasons I wanted a simple point & shoot camera. The primary reason I was interested in this camera was for the DIS mechanism that allows image stabilization. If I want to use any kind of camera I really need this feature. Otherwise I either have to use a tripod or compensate in one way or another.Hand tremors are a big problem for me whenever I try to use any camera. I have developed several ways to minimize the problem from holding my breath to steadying my arms on a solid surface. It doesn't always work and I've taken some amount of ribbing for it. I simply tell everyone I'm doing the best I can, but now I'm doing even better. When I used the DIS mode, I was very pleased with the result. It virtually eliminated the unwelcome blur. The Olympus quickly focused and corrected each picture. I only had a couple of duds in the bunch and with digital these can instantly go into the trash can.My first attempt was to try and see just how easy this camera was to use. I did the initial setup from the Quick Start Guide, but nothing more than that and an overnight charge. I was confident enough to take this camera on vacation to test it out. With no instruction and sans directions I was able to figure out how to work the camera. It didn't take long to become accustomed to not only the feel of the camera, but what worked best under what circumstances. I'm still on the road and will upload a video later.A lot of the information comes up on the screen, a nice wide screen. I definitely appreciated the instant feedback I received. I knew instantly how well things were going (or not). I was able to focus in quite nicely on small things such as a gecko or birds at a distance. Operation is almost intuitive, least ways in my view. There is a function menu along the right-hand side of the screen that let me know what was going on. Here is what I was able to see at a glance:FUNCTION MENU:1. Flash2. Self-timer3. Exposure compensation4. White balance5. ISO sensitivity6. Drive7. Image Size8. AspectThe first go around I simply left the camera on Auto Mode, which worked quite well. If you are thinking or purchasing the Olympus for someone who can do little more than point & shoot, this is perfect. My video attempts weren't great initially, but I was able to improve upon them as I went along. Obviously, once I began to delve into the directions, I was able to hone my craft if you can call it that. As I went along I was thinking that this would be the perfect camera for family outings because it's so easy to work with. There's even a \"Beauty Fix\" mode where you can retouch a picture before you finalize it. How cool can it get? Make those selfies into works of art if you feel like it.MODES:* P (P Mode): Your camera will do the work here in selecting the \"aperture value and shutter speed.\" If you select this your settings can't be changed.* AUTO (AUTO mode): Here is where you let the camera do the talking. Every shot and conditions are \"decided by the camera.\" Once again, if you select this your settings can't be changed.* DIS mode: My favorite, of course. Selecting this modeenables to user to reduce blur that is caused by camera shake and subject movement.\"* BEAUTY (BEAUTY mode): You can retouch your image before finalizing it. It's a \"Beauty Fix\" that I'm hoping will prove to be a lot of fun to use. It's simply learning to use those up and down, back and forth buttons, and pressing the OK button.The arrow pad is easy to work with. There are no arrows, but intuitively most people know what's up, down, right and left. It's quite easy to work with. There's and INFO imprint, an OK button, and an imprinted trash can. There's a red button to press when taking a video, a playback button (indicated by an arrow), and a MENU. Very simplistic, but that's just what a lot of people need. Easy to work with. I very much liked the video button as opposed to the method I have to use on another camera I have. It's necessary to push part way down on a button and then fully depress. I can't tell you how many times I've messed that one up!Intimidated by any kind of technology, including a camera? Don't be. In the initial settings the camera practically points to what you need to do. For example, when you go to set your time zone, there's a map that lights up various sections of the earth. Keep hitting that arrow pad until you find a recognizable area. Then click OK. Use the up and down arrow to turn daylight saving time on or off. The Olympus has got to be the easiest point and shoot camera I've ever worked with outside of the old Vivitar where you opened up the back, dropped the film in and clicked away.What I didn't like. There was a little chirruping-like sound, but it was more annoying than anything else. The location I was using this camera in was loaded with professional photographers and their cameras made plenty of noises. In the scheme of things, the noise was more of an annoyance than anything else. I much prefer a booklet that I have in hand. There was a Quick Start Guide, but those settings charts didn't help me at all when I was away from my computer.Frankly, I fell in love with this camera and aside from its little quirks it's really a performer. There is a lot that can be done with the Olympus aside from the simple point and shoot, but you will need to check out that manual. For example, I found out that depending on the size of the SD/SDHC/SDXC card (4GB) I can store up to a whopping 41,340 pictures. I took only 57 on my first foray into the world of Olympus photography, but now I know there's room for more. A lot more.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:* Olympus Sylus VG-190 Digital Camera* Strap* Lithium Ion Battery (LI-50B)* USB-AC adapter (F-2AC)* USB cable (CB-USB7)* OLYMPUS Setup CD-ROMSPECS:Camera* Product type: Digital camera (for shooting and displaying)* Recording systemStill pictures: Digital recording, JPEG (in accordance with Design rule for Camera File system (DCF)Applicable standards: Exif 2.3, Digital Print Order Format (DPOF), PRINT image Matching III, PictBridgeSound with still pictures: Wave FormatMovie: AVI Motion JPEG* Memory\" Internal memory, SD/SDHC/SDXC/Eye-Fi card* No. of effective pixels:: 16,000,000 pixels* Image pickup device: 1/2.3 CCD (primary color filter)* Lens: Olympus lens 4.7 to 23.5 mm, f2.8 to 6.5* Photometric system: Digital ESP metering, spot metering system* Shutter speed: 2 to 1/2000 sec.* Shooting range:Normal: 0.2 m (0.7 ft) to \u00a5 (W), 0.6 m (2.0) ft.) to \u00a5 (T)Super macro mode\" 0.05 m (0.2 ft.) to \u00a5 (f=8.3 mm (fixed))* Monitor: 3.0\" TFT color LCD display, 460,800 dots* Connector: Multi-connector (USB connector, A/V OUT jack)* Automatic calendar system: 2000 up to 2099OPERATING ENVIRONMENT:* Temperature: 0\u00b0 C to 40\u00b0 C (32\u00b0 F to 104\u00b0 F (operation)/-20\u00b0 C to 60\u00b0 C (-4\u00b0 F to 140\u00b0 F) (storage)* Power supply: One Olympus lithium ion batter (LI-50B)* Dimensions: 103.7 mm (W) x 62.2 mm (H) x 22.5 mm (D)(4. x 2.4 x 0.9 in.)

Olympus VG-190 camera. While some of the camera phones do have decent cameras they are no match for the Olympus lens. The Olympus VG-190 is feature rich - with multiple settings for recording videos, indoor, outdoor settings.However, the best part of the camera is that while it is loaded with features it is surprisingly easy to use. The menus on the camera are easy to navigate and each setting explains how and why it should be used.... call it photography for dummies.Notes- The basics - the camera is a 16M and records at 720HD- Multiple modes for shutter speeds- Has a built in flash and red-eye reduction- Multiple modes for burst modes- Various camera settings including Sunny, Cloudy, Incandescent, Fluorescent, and Auto setting- Options to change between 3:2, 4:3, and 16:9 aspect ratiosAreas for improvement-- Call me old fashioned but I do like view findersFinal Verdict - A very nice combination of value, picture quality in a point and click camera.  I would especially recommend the camera to anyone who may be a bit intimidated with cameras that are full of features. The Olympus VG-190 has the best user interface of any camera that I have evaluated. In short, this may be the best option for older parents and grandparents.5 StarsPlease Note I received this product for reviewing purposes", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice lightweight point

I needed a camera that had a quick refresh between shots, was slim and light, had a good size screen, and most importantly took great shots. I decided on the 16 megapixel Olympus Stylus VG-190. Let's see how it did on satisfying my list of requirements.First of all, I am not a professional photographer, so this review will tell you my impressions on using the camera as a novice and not about purple fringing, white balance and other technical details.First of all, this camera looks cool. It is made of finger print resistant black plastic. It is also thin and easily fits into a pocket. It is also light at only 5.3 oz. The battery is a lithium ion pack that helps keep it lightweight. I usually prefer having AA batteries that I can change when I run out of juice, so this internal battery better last quite awhile (which after about 2 hours of use was still working). You charge it using the enclosed USB cable and adapter.The LCD screen is 3 in and is very bright and clear. It has about 460,000 pixels, but that is probably too technical for this review. The camera powers on very quickly...press the power button and it is ready to go.Pressing OK on the D-pad controller lets you customize your shooting modes and options. The available modes include Program, iAuto, DIS (digital image stabilization), Beauty, Super macro, Scene, Magic filters and Panorama assist. The scene mode includes 14 presets (Self portrait, Sunset, Fireworks, Cuisine, Documents, Beach & Snow, Pet, Portrait, Landscape, Night Scene, Night Portrait, Sport, Indoor & Candle). More than enough for all your picture needs. The Beauty mode allows you to edit your photo with various effects, such as blemishes and puffy eyes. It gives you a before and after screen to view your handiwork. Doubt I would use this a whole lot, but it was fun to play with.The camera comes with a 5x optical zoom. The zoom buttons are located on the top and are within easy reach of your index finger. The flash on this camera is very large. It features a Long Flash mode for extended flash range. I tested this with a few group shots at about 15 ft and it seemed to work ok.So how do the pictures come out? I took a series of outside and inside shots. The outside pics come out great. Colors were vivid and sharp. Inside pictures (with and without flash) came out okay. They did not come out as good in low light as my digital SLR, but I had to remind myself that this is a point and shoot camera.It can record HD video with a record button easily accessed by your thumb on the back of the camera. Quality was okay, but during playback I heard a constant ticking sound. I made multiple recordings and it was on all the recordings. Weird.Viewing of pictures is by pushing the view button above the D-pad. All the buttons on the camera are logically placed.The manual is located on a CD that comes in the box. I would rather have a printed manual, but I realize that this is the way companies do it now. The enclosed quick start guide gives you plenty of information to get you started out of the box.Overall, I am pleased with this camera. Would have liked a little better low light performance and the clicking during the videos was annoying. It has a lot of fun modes to experiment with which will give you many hours of fun.Sample provided for review.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C7NWTNO"}}
