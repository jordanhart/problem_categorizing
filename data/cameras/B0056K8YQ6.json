I found the the threaded screw that attaches to the camera was not long enough. I have first alert security cameras. The cameras have a kinda hood on them. So I went to the hardware store, where I had to buy a female bolt extension and bought a 3 in threaded rod and extra nuts and washers. I had to spend an extra 5.00 to retrofit the camera mounts.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$4.26", "Features": "Product Name : Wall Mount Bracket;Fit for : CCTV Camera, DVR Camera & Spy Camera\nMaterial : Plastic & Metal;Base Diameter : ~ 3.1\"\nMax.
