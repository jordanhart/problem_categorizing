The 18-300mm lense is heavy but has good depth in pic's and v.good zoom range, will recommend if you are travelling.  Nice lense.Would give zero rating for tripod and other accessories.  For the price I paid close to 2G for total package you expect better quality product.  Only after 1 week travel the tripod is falling apart.  The cleaning kit is a waste, remote does not work and the carry bag does not have a zip and is bulky.  I used a different bag for the travel because I am afraid of camera falling out of bag.Over all recommends to buy the camera + Lense. Great lense :)Do not be fooled like me in package (all the other stuff is cheap stuff which is useless).", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product and fast shipping", "Author": "Lucky One", "ReviewID": "R1WZCGEPOE9BMX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using Nikon D90 for about a year, I and my wife decided to get a Nikon D7000. Although we are still learning the features of D7000 with 18-300mm lens, there is no doubt that D7000 is another super product made by Nikon. This package comes with a Nikon case, which is perfect for the camera.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera and lens, terrible tripod", "Author": "Matthew T. Mason", "ReviewID": "RIR6HEZR5METH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As an amateur using this for work, I've found the camera and lens to be easy to use but providing great quality photos.  I could not be happier with the camera and lens.  The tripod that came with it in this package is ridiculously weak, barely strong enough to hold the camera and not anywhere strong enough to count on to hold the camera up.  I don't understand what caused anyone to pair this weak tripod with such a camera as it ends up being counterproductive: I want a tripod to take stable photos but end up with something less stable than if I was to hold the camera with my own hands.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "The seller was so unefficient.", "Author": "Jack Liu \"What is the issue?\"", "ReviewID": "R1VM7W5QVR116M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Whatever the camera is good or not, I am really unhappy. The sellers were so inefficient. I could not believe that this package took them over 48 hours to prepare and send. I chose stand shipping because I thought that I could get the package in five days. My order was issued at the night of October 14th, but it arrived at October 23, which was not as same as what the Stand Shipping described. Angrily, when I wanted to change my shipping speed before the package was sending, the sellers just told me the package was in the shipping department and was not able to change. I was just blowed off by him. To be honest I hate those kinds of attitude for customers.  By the way, last time, when another camera package which I bought months before came without one item, this seller did not give me any massages until I connected with them by myself; than they finally told me about the missing item. At last, they sent that missing item to me, and I got that missing item two weeks later than it should arrived.  The last thing that I want to say is that the D7000 is a really high-performance camera. It is much better than the D5100 which I had before. Maybe the few disadvantages are: 1st: It is much heavier than D5100. 2nd: its LCD screen cannot turn as D5100.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,799.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 11 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D7000 Digital SLR Camera Body + <2> Nikon 18-300mm VR DX AF-S Lens +\n<3> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case + <4> Transcend 32GB SDHC 300x Card + <5> Vivitar 77mm UV Glass Filter +\n<6> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <7> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <8> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader +\n<9> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <10> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <11> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D7000 Digital SLR Camera Body with 18-300mm VR Zoom Lens + 32GB Card + Case + Filter + Remote + Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q7iv5vKgL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008JETT24"}}
