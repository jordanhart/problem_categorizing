This unit is in a small package 4x6\" and about 2\" thick.  It is built very solid with the working parts in the door.  It is a 8 mega pixel camera which give me very nice picture that I'm able to zoom in on without the picture pixilizing.  On one occasion I was even able to zoom in on a uniform and ID the person from their badge name and number.  The IR flash is very powerful and in fact in some instances may even be too powerful.  When used in a area with not much depth I needed to place the IR selector switch on B, which is less powerful and even tape over some of the IR's to keep from getting and over exposed picture.The video portion of this camera works as advertised.  Very clear pirture day and night but again need to watch the IR's in small places for over exposure.  The sound quality and sensitivity is outstanding.  Able to hear conversation well outside the video area.I gave this product a 5 star rating because it was built for watching game, outdoors and it does exactly what it is suppose to do.  I'm using it for something it wasn't intended to be used for and with a little practice was able to adjust it to meet my needs perfectly.If the manufacture were reading this I would suggest to simply give the user more IR adjustment choices, and the trigger time from 15 seconds up to 1 hour vs starting the trigger time at 1 minute.On a side note the box only came with instructions written in French and to date I have not been able to make contact with the manufacture to send me one in English.  Also they do not have this model available for download.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Works for My Needs", "Author": "Murph \"Not zucchini, fettuccini, or bulger wh...", "ReviewID": "R80FAH6N9S1II", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this more for monitoring my home than for game, been a lot of break-ins lately. I've been very impressed with it so far. Pics come out very clear with great colors, and the night shots look good too. So far I've only caught neighbors looking around, but did get some great pics of them. lol! It's easy to program and after a month the batteries are still going strong. Being a techie, I like that I do have a firmware update option should Stealthcam ever need to release one.Why only 4 stars? 2 reasons. First, the reset should be less than one minute. I'd like to see 30, or even 15 seconds to start. The other reason is the time it takes to actually take the first pic. A lot of times the subject can be out of the pic once its triggered and the camera fires off a shot. Placement can help if you can aim it up the path - still, like to see the lag time go away.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "RECORDS SOUND ALSO", "Author": "Lee Wesley", "ReviewID": "R3AMU8N5BA3G5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Unit is really cool. It records Pictures in burst and video & SOUND. I really like that attribute. Really easy to use and has zoom options. I like to use mine for hunting and security reasons. With the zoom you can post these up high and zoom down to catch license plates when people trespass on land.I have that issue a lot. Seems to hold charge well AND USES 8 AA BATTERIES... Problem with big batteries is that they don't sell well at stores and by the time you buy them they are half drained. \"AA\" is way better. I need to buy a 12v battery and test it out on this.

It's easy to use/program, and takes both still pics and video with sound.  It comes with a tree-strap.  (8) AA batteries have been in it for about a month, with no sign of weakening yet.  It also has very effective night/IR capabilities.  I'm going to try to post a pic that it took of a grey fox standing on a boulder - if you see it, it's mine.  It uses standard SD camera cards, and takes pics in JPEG format, so it's easy to get the pics onto my Mac.

Plus it has sound capabilities. By the way I read some previous reviews and am putting you guys on the prayer list, break-ins and stalkings, come on.But seriously, I wish I had more of these cameras to put up at my farm and my lease the picture quality is exceptional, it's easy to set up and use and did I mention it had sound, too cool. These guys got it right on this one.Good job fellas.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extremely Disappointed", "Author": "Jess Sumgai", "ReviewID": "R1SELY23LIPTVD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have now had two of these cameras fail in less than a week. Both were purchased locally. I would not rate it with even a single star but Amazon apparently doesn't allow 'zeros.'After studying reviews on-line for a few days I chose the StealthCam Unit as my first trail camera.The first StealthCam Unit was found to be broken right out of the box. I had opened the box, read the instructions and began installing the batteries. When I had five of the eight batteries installed the interior LCD display came on and the camera buzzed/whirred like a motor was running for a few seconds. The the buzzing stopped and the display went blank, so I installed the remaining batteries and SD card. After that the Unit powered up fine and everything seemed to function fine. I set the time and date and was ready to set it out for a test run when I noticed that there was something rattling around loose between the camera lens and the clear lens window of the exterior case. There is a small round filter that moves into place over the lens, but this one was loose and rattling around freely inside. Took the batteries and SD out and took it back for a replacement.So the second Unit seemed to work fine at first. No loose parts and no whirring/buzzing noises while installing the battery. But the first try at getting photos showed some problems. The card had 18 pics after the first test, and only 14 would open while the others were corrupt and could not be viewed. I should note here that the SD card was bought new for this camera and had never been in any other equipment aside from the first StealthCam Unit. I formatted the card and that seemed to help, but there were still some images with incomplete data, and after a couple more runs the camera began to lock up and not shoot any images at all. The first set of (brand new) batteries got sucked dry well before I reached 100 images over a couple of days. With a second set of new batteries and even attempts to use different SD cards (both from the \"aproved\" list in the manual) and the camera still locked up and took no photos. I even downloaded and installed the firmware update as instructed by StealthCam support, but the problems continued.This one is going back as well and I'll avoid anything form StealthCam from here on out.On top of the above problems, I was less than impressed with the image quality. Daylight color photos were grainy and had bad digital artifacts between light and dark areas. For an 8 megapixel camera I expected much better quality. The B/W night shots were decent.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Small and easy to hide", "Author": "Matthew71", "ReviewID": "RNJZTO1HKSAR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera works good for what is was made to do. I got about 3 weeks worth of use out of it with energizer batteries and it took close to 100 pictures. The camera is easy to set up and use. The size is great it is not big and bulky like most game cameras I have seen. I also tried using the camera to catch thieves but the camera has two drawbacks for doing this.

Game is obviously annoyed and will often leave site. From what I have learned, since, not all led infrared is invisible. This camera has the lesser quality, leds.

These units take good quality daytime and nighttime photos, but for the hour long periods during dusk and dawn, the pictures are too dark and worthless.  It appears that the cameras don't switch to IR flash soon enough during in the evenings and the opposite during the mornings, probably to save battery power.  These periods are key to seeing what comes to the feeders and water tanks.  I contacted Stealth Cam and they had me remove the batteries, turn the cameras back on for 20 minutes to force a reboot/reset of the cameras and then re-install the batteries.  They assured me they had never seen this problem and that it would fix them.  It didn't, so I returned them to the place where I purchased the cameras since hunting season was closing in and I didn't have time to work with Stealth Cam to find a resolution.

Found the camera straight out of the box to have part of the lens loose in the camera. Appeared to be a round transparent disc eclipsing the camera lens.

I suspect there are units in operation where this lens has fallen completely out of the way of the camera, and might have noticeable effects on the image quality.Needless to say, the products went straight back to amazon.

About 20 feet is the best that it will do sensing that something is in the area.  Other than these two things, I like the pictures it takes both day and night.  The sensitivity I can live with but the trigger speed I'm not sure about.  I've had 4 game cameras and they were all in this price range and I think over a period of time that they all give problems.  Out of the four I only have one working.  So I'm thinking this is just typical of cheap game cameras.  The slow trigger speed on this one allows for anything to get out of view by the time the picture is taken.

I decided to use this camera specifically for an issue I have been having with stray dogs getting in my back yard and turning it into a complete litter box (I kid you not).. Well they were dogs alright.. but strays they were not... Apparently my neighbor finds its amusing to let his pack roam the block as they please (But that is another story). I love this camera because its quite easy to set up.. Although it isn't a true no glow camera, which im terribly partial to :), it doesn't emit enough light to startle the subject being photographed. I love the fact that it has a 3 preset toggle switch along with a manual mode, which means its really user friendly (pop in batteries select preset and go).As with all game cameras i try to use the better quality lithium batteries... but this being the holiday season im kind of on a budget.. so I installed standard Duracell Alkys..I installed them late October and 1200 pictures (Mostly of them darn dogs lol), and to date they still have enough juice to run for another month. (PIR Settings, 8MP Resolution, 9 picture burst, 1 zoom, 5 seconds time out).. Stealth Cam and Moultrie are my favorite brands of cameras I am always open to recommendations specifically for those 2 brands.. Moultrie's Customer service once left a bitter taste in my mouth... but I love their game spy line of cameras specifically the M80XT (awesome Cam!!!) .. Stealth Cam Definitely is fine tuning its technology on game cameras.. I was looking through their site and apparently all their line of 2013 game cameras will feature HD pictures/videos and a new processor in the works for their cameras..
