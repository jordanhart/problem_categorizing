{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for indoor residential surveillance", "Author": "S. Hall", "ReviewID": "R17LT4SAKDUKU2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Vivotek IP8133 camera for indoor surveillance after having purchased two vivotek bullet cameras for outdoor surveillance several years ago. This camera does a fantastic job of capturing and displaying video inside of my home while I am not there. It is small enough not to be noticed and sits rather easily upon the little stand. One draw back is that you cannot get any video at night if you do not have any light in the area. The camera does not have an IR illuminator. This version of the camera is not wifi, it is the wired version.One of the great aspects of using Vivotek cameras is the ability to use up to 30 cameras with their software. Thus, you do not have to buy a new license every time you buy a camera. Do yourself a favor, if you are considering on purchasing a camera for residential use, buy vivotek and rest assured that if you ever want to add additional quality cameras to your system.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works well for me", "Author": "Metal Man", "ReviewID": "R2B3B1MT3987LD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:- video files can emailed, ftp'd, or sent to a NAS for events- can use ssl for sending email- has a decent api- can do h.264 and mpeg4- has inputs/outpus- good value for the feature setCons:- image quality in dark environment with only LED light source is poor- can say much about image quality versus other megapixel netcams.  This is good enough for my needsNeutral:- you'll want to install the latest firmware from vivotek.  It really improves image quality", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005UD59NU"}}
