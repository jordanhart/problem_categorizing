{"Reviews": [{"Title": "If you're not married to Canikon, take a look at the K30.", "Author": "Meghan", "ReviewID": "R1HH7QR1DNVOYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently spent a couple of weeks researching and agonizing over the choice of a DSLR. I have a very old Rebel, and a Powershot S5IS P&S;, but was ready to spring for a new DSLR.I finally narrowed it down between the Canon T3i and the Nikon D3200. Both seemed like great choices, and then somewhere I saw the K30 mentioned and started digging in. I had been VERY close to pulling the trigger on the D3200, but I'm glad I waited.After reading about all of the features the K30 has and realizing that it was a LOT of bang for the buck I went for it. I haven't been disappointed! I'm not in the position to drop thousands on glass, but I've been able to pick up several vintage manual-focus lenses for relative pennies and am really enjoying them. The Asahi Pentax-M 1.7 50mm can be found pretty cheaply, and if you look around, you can get the Pentax-A 1.7 50mm for under a hundred bucks. I even got mine thrown in for 25 when purchasing the AF360FGZ flash at a camera show. YES! It's become far and away my favorite lens, even over my two autofocus Sigma lenses.At any rate:This camera feels great in the hand (I'm female and my hands are fairly small, but my big-handed mechanic boyfriend says it feels good to him too).I love the white body (NOTE - it's not a flat white, the camera I received has the \"Silky\" finish which is more of a metallic pearly white).I love the fact that I can pick up ANY Pentax K-mount lens ever made and it will work.I like the fact that it's weather-resistant (though you need a WR lens too).I was able to pick up a AA battery adapter for a few bucks rather than having to rely on proprietary batteries.I could go on and on, but to sum up, I wholeheartedly recommend the K30 with one caveat: it has a fixed LCD screen, not one that will flip out and rotate, and it does not have a separate mic input, so if you're planning to do a lot of video this isn't the right camera for you. Since my main focus is photographs, it's perfect and the fixed screen and lack of mic support was not an issue.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like the camera", "Author": "P.D.", "ReviewID": "RW7Q6LGNEL1AP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is just what i expected, i had a chance to play around with several other brands in this class, and i was dissatisfied with one or another thing, with this camera it seems i found what i was looking for. great picture quality, great response, great sensitivity at night, great battery, intuitive menu, very comfy in my hands.Recommend it", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing sharp images...compact, perfect for small hands!", "Author": "submissivemarie", "ReviewID": "R2JKD7GQCUF8KJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm just learning and many DSLR are too bulky and heavy for me , I'm only 5 feet tall so I need something compact that takes good low light images.
