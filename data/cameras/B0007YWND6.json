Bought this antenae and still got interference, so I called tech support and was then told their wireless camera system is not labeled correctly and it is unsuitable for use inside or in an urban area, because it gets interference from cell phones, microwaves, wireless phones and cable television. Swann tech support lied about needing this device, and it did not help at all to avoid interference or get a better image.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "I don't know how much differance it makes.", "Author": "John R.
