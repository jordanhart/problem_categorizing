The nice thing about the Canon ELPH series is they easily fit into your pocket, are well built/designed, don't cost a lot, come with a boatload of features, and take great pictures.  The SD1300, the latest in the ELPH line continues in that tradition, adding considerable additional sophistication and sacrificing some useful functionality in the interest of cutting cost.It is a small camera and carries with it the baggage that comes with the convenience of having to carry so little baggage.  (sorry, couldn't resist) None of the issues raised, given that they comes as part of the convenience trade-off made me consider anything other than the 5-star rating this camera deserves.-  Many of the functions are only accessible through menus, sometimes several levels deep.  The good new is the Automatic and scene modes are pretty good (as long as you spend a few minutes reviewing what they really do).  This camera is not intended to be used in aperture or shutter priority, let alone full manual.-  The battery life might be shorter than you expect.  That's a trade-off for having a camera that's small and light;  you get a battery that is small and light.  One thing you can do is get a spare battery.  That is good advice for any camera. Another thing that will help is to keep the display off as much as possible.  That means using the monitor as little as possible.  The \"sad\" part is that Canon chose to drop the optical viewfinder in this model.  That means a camera that is simpler and less expensive to make but will go through batteries quicker because you must use the display when taking picture.-  The camera response is a bit slow for effectively capturing children and pets.  The trick for doing that is to either have a great sense of timing and a shutter that reacts instantly or a reasonably fast ( > 4x / sec ) burst mode.  This camera has neither.Some other suggestions that apply:-  Use the lowest ISO available given your requirement for either aperture or shutter speed. To avoid getting technical, higher ISO always introduces higher noise. At issue is when it becomes noticeable. In newer dSLR cameras you can get over 1000, maybe well over depending on the camera, before the noise becomes noticeable. For this camera keeping it at or below 200 is a good idea.-  Don't use in-camera sharpening. Digital pictures will almost always benefit from sharpening but you are better off doing it with a photo editing program.  Computer-based algorithms tend to be more sophisticated and you can better judge the results on your monitor as opposed to the camera LCD.-  If you want more vivid colors and have the choice use sRGB instead of Adobe RGB. While you get fewer colors they are distributed over a wider range. They are also render better on computer monitors, many commercial labs, and any other place your pictures are likely to show up.Finally, I've found the Caselogic QPB-1 Compact Digital Camera Case (Black/Gray) is just the right size for this camera.  It's semi-rigid so you get a fair amount of protection but doesn't add a lot of bulk.  It's made even better by using one of these, Nite Ize SB1-2PK-01 Size-1 S-Biner, Black, 2-Pack, to secure it to a belt loop.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.  I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "It is classy and it takes great pictures", "Author": "CAMPJEEP", "ReviewID": "RCEP2ZJTABAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will try to  share some things I have discovered about this camera, these are just my thoughts, I hope they might be of help .  Some things I am compairing to a canon SD1200 and the SD940, SD1400.  I do not use the viedo enough to judge that part of the cameras.** No SD memory card  included with this camera **, see below* Some will miss the eye viewfinder that the SD1200 has.* Some will miss the HD 720p in the movie mode that the SD940,SD1400 has, The SD1300 has 640x480 at 30fps like the canon SD1200, G11 and S90. * The SD1300 has ( no optical zoom while recording video ) just digital zoom.*  There is a date feature on the SD1300, see below*  The flat button arangement is the same as the SD1200 all but the (( Power Button )) on top is  larger and easier to turn on and off,  I like that ( but be careful ) it does not come on in your pocket, purse or in your soft camera case.* I have not had any trouble using any of the buttons even with my big old hands. The flat buttons on the SD1300 are a ( tad larger than on the SD940 and SD1400 ).* The menu screens are large and very easy to read and use.* *  You get a 2.7inch very clear LCD screen that has a (very good and wide viewing angle in all directions). Note > when your LCD screen is set to a lower brightness you can push and hold down the display button for 1 second and it will go to the brightest setting and do that again and it will go back to the lower setting...A 28mm x 112mm lens, a little better than the 35 x 105 on the SD1200 ( But no view finder on the SD1300 ). *  The SD1300 is very easy to use and small enough to carry every place you go for those spontaneous grand kid pictures like the SD 1200 was . Just a very good basic camera.  *  I like that the mic for the video is in the front of the camera instead of being on the top (where I put my finger)  like the canon  SD970 and others, it picks up less finger movement noise being in the front. **  Timing and Performance** ( Using program mode )> Very fast start up time of just over 1 sec. I can not tell any difference in shot to shot or flash shot to shot times between the SD1300 and the SD1200 using them in the program mode, which is ( 2secs with out the flash ), and 3 to 4secs with the flash on, (( up to 6secs for full flash recharge )).(Update > Some of review sites(C-NET) are getting around 2.7 to 3 seconds for the SD1300 between shots with out the flash so I grabed the two cameras and tryed the two again(SD1300 SD1200) with and with out the flash on and I had the same results both ways, ((I used program mode)) both times and they would focus and recharge the flash evenly also...)  Shutter lag is good for a canon point and shoot but if you ( pre focus ) that will help even more. To pre focas > >  Push shutter button down half way untill camera beeps and green square apears on LCD screen,picture should be clearly in focas at this point, if not let up on the shutter button and repeat the steps again. these steps will also help take a good clear (in focas)  picture,  just something for you to try if your having trouble getting your picture.  I never tested the continuous shooting( but see my battery test) but canon says it is 0.9 per sec where the sd 1200 is 1.4 shots per sec, if that is important to you.  UPDATE > The 1200 does seem to be faster, quicker than the 1300 in continuous mode, how much I dont know but you can tell the difference...* (Battery) I did test the battery (NB-6L same battery as SD1200) by using continuous shooting mode ( with the flash on ) and got well over 400 pictures and it was taking ( 1 picture every 2 seconds or less in the continuous mode( flash on ) if that helps you out on the continuous shooting part, and when I turned the flash off it seemed to do prety good coming from a newer small canon point and shoot world.* (Battery life).  In real life I get around 300 or more pictures with some of them using the flash, your still need a second battery  for a backup.* The battery has a little larger capacity at 1000mAh in the SD1300, were as the canon SD940 and the SD1400 is a smaller capacity at  760mAh if that matters to you.** A nice backup battery is a (power2000) for canon NB-6L (1200mAh)$19.00. I have used them for years.I really like the battery charger that comes with the camera, it is small and charges quickley, about one and a half hours the very first charge and then one hour or less there after... Some set back the brightness of the LCD a couple of notches to save some battery. I think your new battery will do better after the first  couple of charges.* 10/30/2010  At the Columbus zoo we shot  350 pictures and a lot of them with flash on with one charge...** Very good image quality keeping the iso at 200 and below. I am getting about the same image quality as the SD 1200 which is very good for this small size point and shoot camera. * As point and shoots get better we often try and compare them to digital SLRs ( speed,noise,  ISOs,  picture quality ) but because of the point and shoots very small sensors and craming all those mega pixels into them  it is just asking to much of the little cameras.... Fewer pixels mean there's more room on the sensor and the individual pixels can be made larger to gather more light, making the camera better able to record low-noise images in low-light situations.  This is just me, but I like using the program mode and 100,200iso best and I try not to use the auto mode indoors  ((auto works good outdoors in good light though, Lighting is everything.  Indoors alot of times auto seems to want to use a (very high iso)(and sometimes no flash) to get low light photos, but this just results in more noise, which makes your pictures look noisy grainy or snowy looking on larger prints,(or the yellow tint that some are talking about). *  I use program mode and set the iso indoors to (( 100iso ))in good light conditions or ( 200 iso ) in poorer light indoors for the best image quality indoors with out all noise in the picture. Again auto does good outdoors in good light but keep your eye on the iso in auto indoors... *  Portrait mode does better indoors than auto in keeping the iso down. It uses  200iso and below. not bad... *They also have taken away the supper fine quality option for the last couple of  years , you just have fine and normal now, I miss the supper fine option...  The more I use this camera the more I find myself useing ( 100iso in program mode ) in good light conditions  indoors or outdoors). Again indoors you might have to use 200 to get the picture you like...** Just a side note, before judgeing the camera and your picture quality on your computer or camera screen get some pictures printed out, why I say this I thought the pictures that I took at the rest home were just ok, but I took them to the store and had 8 by 10s made and they look so so much better, you can see these pictures on this site under (view and share images on the  SD1300s home page). I wish you could see the printed ones... * A lot of the review sites blow there pictures way up and look for defects, your likely to only make 5x7 or 8x10s and not see (what they see). If you are going to make larger prints or need a better (low light camera) and still stay in a point and shoot  you could go with a canon  S90, S95 or the bigger G11, G12,  but (much more money I know)! Just keep the iso down at 200 and below and you will do fine...)*  The SD1300 seems to have a nice sharp lens even  at the telephoto end of the zoom. Highlights sometimes tend to blow out in very bright sun (direct light source)  as with all small cameras(small sensor) this size, you can see this in some of the pictures I posted on this sight for the 1300. ( But to be fair my G11 does this also ).I do not use  I-Contrast in the program mode while shooting, some times in play back I will try it but I am not a big fan of it even then, it will brighten the picture up in dark areas but seems to increase the noise a little, again this is just me alot of people seem to like it and have good luck with it see what you think...In auto mode you have no controll of  I-Contrast and can not turn it off or on... * I just realy like the colors in the pictures that the canon cameras produce, again thats just me thinking out loud. Not much problem with red eye in pictures useing the SD1300 unless in a very dim lit room and there are some times when it can not modify or fix it in red-eye correction, I have many small newer canon cameras and it is no worse or better with red eye than the rest of my newer cameras with red eye correction.The SD1300 has a touch more style, larger LCD and a little more virsatle lens than the SD1200, but the 1200 is also a very good camera.The SD1300 does have a weak battery door cover like the SD1200.  *No Memory card *  You do not get a (SD Memory Card) with the camera, they just do not include a card anymore, just be aware so you won't be with out one.  A 4gb card ( class 4 or class 6 ) would be a good place to start  (if your going to use the movie mode any at all ).You could get by with a 2gb ( which is good for about 632 pictures ) if not using the video mode much.A 4gig SD card would be good for 1,231 pictures.* If your new to this digital camera stuff remember to low level format the SD card first thing.( Save your pictures first, doing this will also erase all your pictures. )* I have used the SD1300 for about 12 months now and is holding up very well.* There is a date feature on the SD1300, it shows up on the right side at the bottom of the picture.You can see it when reviewing the photo...Push menu button and scroll down, it is the very last idem there, You have 3 choices,(off), (date), (date and time)... When you go to take your picture your screen will have the word (DATE) on the screen above the iso reading, right side at bottom so you will know it is on...  * I carry my camera in a little phone case that has a belt clip not a loop  for fast & easy on and off the belt.* OK, your right I could lose it that way... I definitely recommend picking up a small camera case for protection, watch out for cases using velco,the velco likes to grab ahold of you camera strap and not let go.I also like theLowepro Apex 20 AW (Black) CASE it has room for spare battery, sd card cable, cleaning cloth). It has a little rain coat also. Good for hikers and backpackers.The Lowepro Napoli 20 case is very nice  but no room for spare battery on this one and could let dust in case, not fully inclosed.**  Casecrown  ( SD1300IS 12 MP Digital Camera Carrying CaseCrown Black ) < I like these alot > Canon PowerShot SD1300IS 12 MP Digital Camera Carrying CaseCrown Compact Travel Case (Black) Canon PowerShot SD1300IS 12 MP Digital Camera Carrying CaseCrown Compact Travel Case (Crimson)  < < See my reviews on these  if you have the time > >CaseCrown Protective Compact Travel Camera Case (Grey) for Canon PowerShot SD1300IS 12 MP Digital Camera Be carefull of some of the canon cases, the metal magnet catch on the flap might or could scratch the cameras LCD screen takeing it out or puting it in  the case (just my thoughts).. I am sure alot people like them and have good luck with them, this is just my opinion, The canon case I have (Canon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case)  has no room for a spare sd card or spare battery if that would help you any.These are very nice and roomy cases, with alot of storage > Case Logic DCB-302 Compact Camera Case (Black)Case Logic DCB-302 Compact Camera Case (Gray)One more case to look at Case Logic QPB-201 EVA Molded Compact Camera Case (Black)  Only one zipper on this one and xtra battery seems to slide out of case a tad to freely .*  In the menu mode I set the I S mode to continous.  The display overlay to grid lines(the grid lines help me take straighter pictures, you may use it for the 1/3 rule also). I set review to 2seconds, AF-assist beam to on,Review info to off, Lens retract to 0 seconds.White ballance to auto, if this would be of any help to you.I like using continuous shooting mode alot also.I like to set the AF (auto focas) frame to center (some times) instead of face AiAF and just shoot (focas) on what ever that I am shooting , this is found in the main menu setting, Again this is just me dont take this advice to the bank but check it out if you want or have the time... I posted some pictures on this site ( see > View and share related images on main page  ) for the SD1300,  to give you some idea about how your pictures would look (color - sharpness - moving shots - iso noise in pictures -  zooms - modes - cropped pictures), if that would help.* Please look at everybodys pictures to see what you think before you buy the SD1300. (( Please if mine pictures are not helpful vote them down and I will delete those, I need to delete a lot of them, please help me out here, Thanks...)  If you have any questions I will try to answer them the best I can, no camera is perfect...well not many. My favorite SD point & shoot was a canon SD550, SD850, SD880, I thought the SD1100 and SD870 were  very good looking cameras but never had a chance to use one of them,  what was your fav canon SD... I mostly take pictures of bear in the Smokey Mountians (CADES COVE) and love chaseing the grand kids around taking their pictures. ( And this year the Outter Banks NC ).Update 2/3/2011 > The new replacement camera for the SD1300 is being called a Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS 12 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom (Grey) Comes in 5 colors (Blue, Silver, Grey, Pink and Orange)Note one of many changes is that they did change the battery used to a NB-4L 760mAh from the NB-6L 1000mAh battery if that would be any of help.Many other interesting changes also,some are good and some not so good , Alot of bells and whistles on this one,  check it out...", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot SD1300IS", "Author": "Daniel K \"Daniel\"", "ReviewID": "R1UTXKR0HRMCBK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a replacement to my Canon PowerShot SD600. The main reason I chose to replace it was for the IS feature. When I purchased to SD600 it was on sale and the IS features on cameras were an expensive option on upgraded models. I have to say the feature performs as expected. Obviously it's not going to do much if there is a lot of camera shake, but it does the job for what it's intended to do. Picture quality is excellent. Low light does well despite the reviews I've heard. Manual settings do just as well as auto settings. I like the playback button that lets you review pics rather than having to switch the camera into another mode. When taking multiple shots the lag time between pics is minimal. Videos work well with it but there is that pesky no in and out zoom during a video. Sound quality was surprisingly good with video mode as well. It takes outdoor video well with little wind noise. I was a bit cautious about buying a camera with no viewfinder as my last camera had one, but let's face it, I hardly used it when I had it.  Insisting on a camera with a viewfinder also significantly limited my choices for point and shoots. I'm satisfied with no viewfinder and this camera is exactly what I expect in a good point and shoot. I considered the SD1200IS since it was on sale and a little less expensive but I figured for a few extra features, it's worth the extra $50. Battery life is great! Even under moderate to heavy use it lasted all night and part of the next day. I'd suggest always having another battery pack as a backup though as you never know when you might need it. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a quality point and shoot. For the price I don't think you can ask for much more in a compact digital camera.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lens flare problem...but if you get a decent copy it might work.", "Author": "D. Kartman", "ReviewID": "R1JSKFRCLA2A4F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Our copy of the 1300 has a flare problem while a direct light source is in the picture- a top to bottom light streak appears in the image.  We have tried everything from white balance setting, to angles, to color.  In every image there is a VERY visible vertical 'ghost' flare from top to bottom.  It is only fixed by using the flash (which is inadequate in modest sized rooms) or shielding the lens from the light source with your hand.  In video mode it is almost impossible to avoid, and it looks terrible.  I think (hope) this is a bad copy and not indicative of Canon quality in point and shoots.  We have some decent experience with photography, so I don't think it's user error.  Definitely expected more for the money and from Canon.Update:After a little more playing around with the 1300 we decided to return it.  The lens flare was not as bad after reviewing the still images but it was still there, and the movies were still not acceptable quality.  While back at the store the decision was whether or not to get another of the same copy or try a different model.  Opted for the different model after remembering the issues with other Canon point and shoots.  Took home the Nikon S4000 and have been happy with it so far.  Nikon Coolpix S4000 12 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Panel LCD (Silver)Here is a comparison of the two after about a week:Pros from Canon 1300:-Familiar Canon menus and more simple menu similar to Canon's SLR's.-Power button, shutter release and zoom ring were all in a comfortable layout and good spot for my hands, which aren't huge for a guy, but I just can't comfortably hold Canon's 780,940,1400 point and shoot bodies for long.- This is nerdy, but the 1300 is capable of using the SDXC cards, a step up from SDHC, that will become a standard sooner or later.-AutoFocus was pretty good for point and shoot, but not what I would call lightning fast.-12 MP and a decent image sensor, which is about the best a point and shoot can benefit from anyway.-The battery is removed from the camera to charge in a wall adaptor, which means you can carry spare batteries and keep the camera free to use.Cons from the 1300:-More expensive than comparable cameras.-First copy I had ended up with a lens issue.  Nit- picky I know, but when you pay for the best you want the best.  This spooked me away from returning it for the same model, and started my looking elsewhere.-No noticeable improvements over Canon cameras released in the last two years.  Tech specs are better, but hard to see the benefits over say the 1200 model.Pros from the Nikon:-More features, and for a better overall value than the Canon (same price, but better value).  Body is similar size, and the power, zoom and shutter release are all same location as the Canon.-Super cool touch screen, which is maybe a bit unnecessary, but hey, it's cool.-Fast start up, for those \"Wow, look at that!\" moments.-Tons of auto shooting modes (maybe too many) but handy if you are a person that wants the camera to think for you.Cons from Nikon:-AutoFocus can lag a bit if you are zoomed in.-720p video is really not that great.  The ISO, or the write ability/speed of the camera to its sensor is not good enough to make the 720p work in room lighting conditions (haven't tried in outdoor light yet).  The resolution is top to bottom 720p alright, but the picture is grainy because the camera's little sensor just can't handle that much that fast in moderate to poor light.  This is a biggy too, because some people may buy a point shoot with 720p just to get HD.  Our copy of this camera is better indoors at the next lower video setting, 640x480.-You must plug in the camera to charge it. Can't take the battery out to charge.Hopefully this long update is helpful.  I didn't want to jump all over this little camera for a flaw and then not give further explanation.  I think the Canon is a fair 3 stars, but not really better than that.  After all, this is just a point and shoot, and for what it's supposed to be, it's fair at it.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Another Home Run By Canon", "Author": "IAMSLICK", "ReviewID": "RIQ0DV2PPBU7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nobody does digital point and shoot as well as Canon in my opinion, and the SD1300IS is just another example of maximum feature/functionality in tiny little package.  I have owned or still own the Canon S3IS, S5IS & Rebel XS.  Those three cameras are Ginormous compared with the SD1300IS.I bought this camera for my wife to carry in her purse so she can shoot pictures and video of the kids while they're out and about, or when she drops in on them at their school.  No camera bag needed, this camera fits in a zipped interior pocket of her purse.I gave it to her and she was able to successfully power it on/off, shoot pictures, shoot video, zoom, delete bad shots, and navigate the menu system without referring to the manual.  The point here is if you currently own a Canon point and shoot and are looking for an upgrade, the learning curve on the SD1300IS is almost zero.  If you've never owned a Canon point and shoot, you will figure this one out very easily.The 12MP pictures are stunning, but to be honest I can't tell the difference between the ones that are 12MP and the ones that are 8MP on my Canon S5IS.  The pictures the Rebel XS takes are a notch above the others, definitely a noticeable difference there.The video quality is 30fps 640x480 (plenty), same as my S5IS.  The image stabilization is a must for this to be of any use, and works like a champ.  A 4GB SDHC card holds about 32 minutes worth of video, 8GB 64 minutes, 16GB more than 2 hours!  The video is very easy to transfer to your computer and burn to a DVD or upload to Facebook using the included USB cable.  There is also an included cable that allows you to play video on your TV via the yellow video cable port.The appearance of the camera is so cool.  I bought my wife the green one, and it looks great.  I like how the lens completely retracts into the body and covers itself with a protective layer.  A handy camera strap is also included, which is good because this thing is so small I could see it slipping out of your hands.All in all, a very easy to use, functional, attractive camera that I have no hesitation recommending!", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera but bad lens mechanism", "Author": "T.

I did purchase an extra 4gb SD card but have not had to use it yet.  (I have over 600 pictures and probably 40 minutes of video on the first one.)  I do suggest purchasing a camera case of some sort for protection.  I found one at Target which is just a padded cloth type, and it prevents the camera from getting scratched up in my purse but doesn't take up much room.  I do put the strap over my wrist while shooting because it is so small you can drop it easily.  Buying from Amazon.com allows me to purchase a really GREAT product saving the tax I would pay at a retailer, and it ships for FREE.

My experience with Canon has been very positive, but because of my budget, I considered other brands, and initially purchased a Nikon Coolpix S3000 12mp from Amazon.  I returned it within a week.  I realized that Canon's superior lenses have me spoiled.  Okay, getting to the point.  I put it to the test in various lighting, and in just basic auto mode, with zero effort, this camera produced images I usually have to break a sweat to create!  Without any of my usual props, lighting equipment, or tricks, I was able to achieve clear, crisp beautiful images.  When I tried similiar shots with the Nikon, images were blurred and had a yellow or blue hue.  This little, easy to operate, easy to carry device captured the image as I saw the live object, and the way I wanted to share it with potential customers.I noticed other reviewers who had owned other Canons like me were not pleased with this model because they missed features from their old devices or thought there was room for better technology.  I'm very happy with how straight-forward and easy this is to figure out and operate.  There are features that have remained similar to those of my older camera, with updates that just made them sweeter.  There's only one feature that my older model has that this one does not, but everything else makes up for that.  On my older model, the LCD flips out, and can spin around, tilt different ways, to assist in taking shots at odd angles.  I can't say I miss it, though, because this model is like having an assistant set everything up for me so I can stroll in and snap the shots stress-free.

I tested it and compared it to other digital cameras, and this camera beat out the competition.I compared the Panasonic Lumix DMC FP1, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1, the Canon Powershot S500 (my 8 year old malfunctioning digital camera), the Canon Powershot SD1300 IS, and my Canon Rebel T1i (my dSLR...an unfair comparison, but I wanted benchmark for these cheaper cameras).  I had always liked my old Canon S500, but I read some reviews on Amazon and other websites, and it seemed like the Panasonic cameras were really good cameras at a great price.For me, the number one consideration is picture quality.  If you don't have that, you don't have anything.  Things that detract from picture quality are poor signal to noise, lack of sharpness, poor color rendering, and various artifacts.  Therefore, I tested these 5 cameras under different conditions.  I copied the jpegs onto my computer, and I looked at the images at 100% to see how good they really are.  The most revealing results were shot under medium light indoors.  This is very important if you ever want to take any indoor pictures.  The results were as follows (from best to worst):1) Canon T1i (1 year old, about $700), excellent pictures even without flash2) Canon SD1300 IS (brand new, about $110), very good photos for a compact digital camera3) Canon S500 (8 years old, $400 new, not performing as well as it used to)Surprisingly, although this is not shooting as well as it used to 8 years ago, it still outperformed the Panasonic cameras.4) Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1 (brand new, about $90), this had very poor signal to noise and moderately poor color rendering.5) Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP1 (brand new, about $80), this camera performed significantly worse even than the FH1.  The non extending lens is nifty but yields poor photos.In addition to this, I found that the Canon was easier to operate and easier to take videos.Nowadays, compact digital cameras are quite inexpensive.  Do yourself a favor and buy a high quality camera.  More megapixels does NOT necessarily mean better pictures, and having a large optical zoom can sometimes compromise lens quality and thus picture quality.  Also, consider sensor size: this can make a big difference in picture quality, though some manufacturers make better sensors even when comparing sensors of the same size.

First, I wanted a relatively inexpensive one - out of the 4 previous cameras, one was dropped in a bathtub, 2 broke, and 1 got thrown into a trashcan by accident.  I also do a lot of simple movie-editing for Facebook, so I wanted a camera that recorded in a file format that is Windows compatible.  I wanted one that took SD cards - they're cheaper and I already had the one from my last camera. I wanted to be able to zoom while recording (one of my cameras did not have that feature...VERY annoying) and I wanted a good sports/action shot setting.

We have a lot of programs and events at our church, and my pictures never come out well.That being said, this camera is everything I wanted and more!  It's durable & easy to use, and the battery lasts forever!  My low-light pictures come out much better than before!

So after finally getting fed up with my Kodak C563's indoor photo quality, I thought it was time to get a Canon.  Here's what I was looking for in a digital camera: Under $200, good indoor photo quality, and an \"auto\" mode and a \"manual\" mode to play around with.  I wasn't really interested in recording video (my Sony camcorder does a better job of that than any digital camera) and having a manual viewfinder wasn't really important, so I opted for this camera.What I like: for its size, this camera packs a lot of features.  There is an \"auto\" mode where the camera decides how to set ISO, white balance, contrast etc., when taking a photo.  There is also a \"program\" mode where you can manually set these parameters, or choose from a list of preset parameters based on shooting conditions.  Unless you're shooting in full sunlight, I find that the \"auto\" mode tends to set ISO a little higher than I'd like (making for a \"grainy\" picture) and contrast a little lower than I like.  Actually I find that auto mode is kind of unpredictable as far as photo quality goes.  But I've also found that shooting in program mode and setting ISO to 100 and quality and resolution set to the max, I get great photos 90% of the time, so I usually shoot in that mode.  Another nice feature is Canon's macro mode - where you can get detailed close-up photos (1.2-12 inches away if I recall).  I posted a couple macro mode flower shots on Amazon for your viewing pleasure.What I don't like: the battery life is not as good as using 2 AA rechargeable batteries.  But having the Canon rechargeable battery is a necessity due to the camera's small size.  I find that I can take about 150-200 shots on a full charge, so I need to carry the charger with me while on vacation (or pony up another $35 for an additional Canon Battery).  Another negative is that it is very easy to partially cover up the flash while holding the camera; it's located in a spot where you'd naturally put your left forefinger when holding the camera with two hands.  This isn't a problem for me since I've trained myself not to do that, but if you hand your camera to someone else to take a picture, it's a real possibility.All in all it's a great camera with a lot of features (many of which your average snap-shooter probably won't use).  For the price, it's a great deal.  I really think this camera is worth the price you pay and then some.  Like any other complex electronic device, you MUST read the whole manual to get the most from it - don't assume you know how each mode works and how to navigate the menus or you'll be disappointed like some of the other reviewers here.Oh, and I can recommend the Canon PSC-1000 Leather Case with this camera - it fits the SD1300 perfectly.

Canon's support was very patient and insightful. The replacement camera is a refurbished one, it works a little better, the focus is better however the pictures in Auto mode are still poor quality.

I initially though it was the slower write times of my SD card, so I put in a class 10 SD Card.  Same slowness.  I'm used to instant results.Also, the burst mode is slower than previous models.On the plus side, it's a well build product, offers a wider angle and longer zoom than previous releases and takes decent photos and movies(in 640x480). Photo quality is very good for it's class.  It also looks stylish. Plastic tripod mount doesn't matter to most people. I simply find the sluggish performance unacceptable. Give me the SD1200 anyday. Performance over style.Concering Megapixel:I have a big beef with the whole megapixel game.  This is not the most important attribute to a camera.  As you raise the megapixels, you lose quality, especially indoors/low light.  This is especially true with a tiny point.  What this translates to is noise. As the megapixel goes up, the more you can notice noice even at ISO 100!  What's worse is that the compression algorithm really destroy the details as the ISO increases.  But the manufacturers focus on Megapixels because that's how the everyday consumer judges a camera.  The fact is, most of us don't have a need for anything over 6mp which is more than adequate for a quality 8x10 print.  All we are getting is a lower quality photo and files that take up more card/disk space.  The sad part is that if Canon or Nikon were to put out a 8mp camera with superious photo quality, the camera would flop as the cusumer looks at megapixel first.This is a perfect example of consumer conception driving an industry to make an inferior product.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not on par with other PowerShot or ELPH models", "Author": "KTester", "ReviewID": "RQ3D7O1SE398B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I already own an ELPH from 2007 that I wanted to replace before an upcoming trip.  I loved that camera, the SD800IS.  The SD1300IS was such a disappointment, however.I took the camera to a wedding the first weekend I had it, excited to capture pictures of family and festivities.  Half of the pictures, in more than adequate light, were totally out of focus.  The entire picture came out blurry; it wasn't that the autofocus focused on the wrong area of the picture.  Several shots in several different situations (lighting-wise) turned out this way, so my frustration isn't that it just goofed up one time.  It was impossible to tell this from the LCD screen after capture; only when I viewed the picture full-size on my computer did I notice the mishap.  I realize this is not a top-of-the line camera, and a point and shoot... but I expect better from Canon.  This camera isn't the cheapest on the market, either.  I feel like maybe Canon cheaped out a little bit in order to release this camera model at a lower price than last year's model, the SD1200 IS,  which they released at $239.  My previous Canon camera didn't have these problems.The location of the flash in this model must be slightly different from other models.  Everytime someone else took a picture for me, and I mean EVERYTIME, the shot had to be retaken because that person had their finger over the flash.  I never had this problem with my other ELPH, so I figure it must be in a slightly different place (this camera is a bit smaller than the SD800 IS, so maybe this is why).Overall, this camera did take some great shots.  However, the proportion of totally unusable, awful shots was too high for a brand new camera.  I returned it (thanks to Amazon's great return policy) and am now trying out the SX20IS.

The photos have a strong yellow emphasis - not at all like the subject photographed - and they simply look like and are poor quality pictures.  The manual setting for 'fluorescent' is not quite as bad, but the color is still not accurate - not even close.The annoying delay between taking a picture and the LCD becoming available again is merely annoying.

Loutzenhiser", "ReviewID": "RMSRXXRV8UGQ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this camera for myself so I could stick it in my pocket and take it with me on weekend trips, etc.  We have used it in Yosemite (outdoor shots in the snow, etc.), inside Black Chasm Cavern (cave with not much lighting), at Daffodil Hill (outdoor area with lots of daffodil flowers and scenic shots), and a variety of other locations.  While it is not a \"professional\" camera (it is \"just\" a point-n-shoot model) I have been pretty pleased with the performance overall.  Like all point-n-shoots, it suffers when shooting something that is moving quickly or when holding it in a dark environment with the flash turned off.  Using a mini-tripod helps in the latter situation.  I really like the widescreen mode for still shots, works well (frames the shot better) for many situations, especially outdoors.I will note that the shots I got in the cavern actually turned out generally better than an amateur photographer I was with who was using an SLR.  I was very careful to hold the camera steady in this somewhat low-light condition and tried to brace it on a railing, etc., to minimize movement while taking the photo.  Also tried using the black and white setting in the cavern and liked those results as well.I haven't played with many of the more detailed settings extensively.I have run the battery down a couple times so far and the only complaint I have is that the battery seems to hold a charge well for maybe 200 photos or so (wasn't really paying attention to the number), however it seems to lose charge relatively quickly (battery indicator stays on full for quite a while, then drops *relatively* quickly instead of \"smoothing\" out the charge indicator drop over time).  A minor inconvenience and might be something that changes with multiple charges and discharges of the battery.  Not anything serious, a VERY minor compaint but I thought I would mention it.  I also bought a spare battery for longer trips so I have only used each battery once or twice so far.  They seem to charge quickly with the included wall charger.Suffers slightly in the same general areas as other point-n-shoot cameras, but I really like it overall.

The pictures lose their detail and look unnatural.To qualify my comments above, I'm comparing to a Canon SD800IS I've used for many years.  I also have a Canon Rebel T2i that I've had for nearly a year.  Both cameras take great pictures.  I calibrate my monitor with an X-Rite i1 Display Pro.In the summer of 2010, I bought the SD1200 for my daughter and it takes decent pictures for its price.  The size of the SD1200 and acceptable picture quality prompted me to buy the SD1300 so I could have a lighter point and shoot to carry in my pocket.  Unfortunately, due the quality issues, I can't really count on the SD1300 unless I'm just taking outdoor pictures in bright sunlight.I think the Digic 3 was a better processor than the Digic 4.  The SD800IS, which used the Digic 3 processor, is superior to the Digic 4-based SD1200, SD1300, and the SD780 (which I bought for my mom).  The SD1300 is the worst yet.

They all take great pics and I find them super easy to use.  I'm a local Pro in NYC.  I've been exclusively digital for about 7 years, and am always looking for cameras that give me the most practical control.  I have 3 of the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS s' and my sister has the Canon PowerShot SD1200IS.What I like best about these cameras is that it's as simple to adjust exposure as it is on a classic film camera.  Two pushes or so of a button, and your on a screen that gives one a clear option to under or over expose by up to two and a half stops. (Thats opening or closing the camera \"eye\" to allow more or less light in).  It's incredibly useful in variable light.  As well in constantly changing species of light, the camera easily allows switches between daylight, florescent, cloudy, tungsten and the remaining luminant temperatures.The flash is very easy to turn of and off, as well is it simple to change the ISO/ASA with a few button pushes.  This said about the flash, I use it as little as possible.  The camera takes great pictures in low light, and the image stabilizer works very well.  Even at 1/15 of a second, I'm oft times surprised that the image came out as crisp as it did.I stay away from the full auto mode, but turn it to when I know a less savvy \"cameraman\" gets hold of it.  My Mum loves the auto mode, and uses it almost exclusively.  She has a full sized 8x10 on her mantle of us 3 (including my Pop) in Paris next the Eiffel Tower, that she is entirely proud of, and it was shot in full auto mode.  Mum has the model 2 generations prior, and it is still going strong.  That example of longevity and ease of use is the reason I'm writing this review.I did notice something quite cool in a camera shop the other day.  I picked up the 1200 and my finger was very close to the lens.  The camera automatically shifted to macro mode, and I could very easily see in detail the grooves of my finger prints on the viewfinder.  I was surprised and  very impressed by the cameras auto intelligence.I have actively used the Macro (close up) setting for photographing some of my artwork on the fly.  I do woodcrafting, and have used the camera on several occasions to show clients my progress.  I do a fair amount of very small pieces, so many a time have placed the subject on the window sill, atop a plain white sheet of paper, and a solid image have I snapped.I'm writing this review with the experience of only the two prior models.  I'm still yet to hold this one in my hand, but if all holds true to form, this camera will be as solid of a performer.I did withhold one star from my review as I've noticed the subtraction of the viewfinder.  I'm a purest in that sense, and a camera that cannot be looked through and fired does not sit well with me.  Granted I use the LCD a lot, I like being able to aim and fire in the classic compact stance.  I feel such a detachment from the image capture, when I'm holding the camera up and staring at an LCD.  It feels pedestrian and unengaged.  That's really just my preference and me being a bit judgemental of the digital age. :)The viewfinder models also allow that the LCD can be turned off, and although I've not done extensive research on this, I feel it helps conserve the battery when your LCD is not constantly on.  I saw another reviewer who claimed his eyesight necessitated a viewfinder, and that this model was not for him.  To you sir, the PowerShot SD1200IS is still available here at Amazon.  It cost about $70 more, but may be well worth it to you.I find that model has a better selection of body colors.  The orange  Canon PowerShot SD1200IS 10 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Orange)  and green are quite stark.  Of my 3 PowerShot SD1100IS s', my brown one is my favorite.  It's darkness in tone makes it not so noticeable and my subjects don't always realize I have it out.  My wife has the pink one and it is just the prettiest little thing.  We also have a gold one, that we plan to use exclusively with an underwater housing we purchased from the \"Fantasea\" company.Good luck to you all on your hunt for the perfect camera.  For me I've found it.  Hopefully you need look no further.  Go ahead....... Put it in your cart....... Proceed to checkout....... Place your order......I promise you won't be disappointed.:) :) :)Happy Holidays To AllBPS.  I forgot to mention that I use the video function quite a bit.  My niece and nephew are at such a fun age, and I no longer need to carry around a separate video camera to record their events.  With the current average size of an SD card, I'm able to record birthday song after birthday song and endless minuets of all the laughs we have.  We got the Wii Game Just Dance 2 for the Thanksgiving holiday, and they're great at it.  It's a fantastic game and it's hilarious to see them compete against the adults.  It's so so funny.  I'll write a review about that game when I get some time.  :)", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "ANSSO", "ReviewID": "R3GDQWZDGUGXQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this camera because it is small and it is a Canon.  Since I have had it for only four days I will only say it takes great pictures on the Auto mode with and without the zoom.  I took a few pictures in the dark and they came amazingly clear for this size camera.So far I am a very satisfied customer.PROS: Quality of pictures, size, flash, comes with a battery charger and Amazon gave me a free 4GB card.CONS: No viewfinder but if you want one, you get a camera with it. Battery life is kind of short so I got an extra battery.Will come back later to add to this review.UPDATE OCTOBER 29/2010I have used this camera now since the middle of June and I am still very satisfied with it.The pictures come great, it is portable, easy to use, and it has a reallly big screen for its size.Please keep in mind this camera is meant to be small and will not have some of the features of bigger cameras.I am very happy with it because it is a nice point and shoot camera and fulfills my needs of amateur photographer!!!!If you need or want a much better and/or sophisticated camera, no need to buy this one.

Well, they somehow have made a worse camera.  Long story short, I think the computer inside the SD1300IS is TOO smart.  On auto, it constantly tries to pick the right ISO setting and only succeeds about 75% of the time.  The other 25% of the time the picture is too dark.  It also has trouble in my family room with the recessed lighting; many times the white walls look yellow.  Yeah, I can go into the settings and switch some things around, but should I really have to?  Finally, the flash is too powerful.  I don't want to turn a dimly lit room into daytime; I just want enough light to take a picture that accurately captures the scene.I'm returning this camera and saving up the money to buy a SLR camera.

Freeman", "ReviewID": "R2HCU56F2FAK3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally shoot with a DSLR, but was looking for a vacation-portable camera that I wouldn't be afraid to carry onto a roller coaster or log flume.  I also wanted a camera that would be family friendly - it had to have a full-auto mode that took decent pictures.  It also had to be substantially better than a cell phone camera, since I already have one of those with me all the time - and in this price range that isn't a given.I picked the SD1300, and I am pretty happy with it so far.  Some general observations:1.  The auto-ISO tends to be pretty aggressive so if you are going to make a big print you might want to set that to manual.  For indoors shots I'd say you're really only getting 2-3MP of real data, and the rest is noise.  That isn't atypical for a camera like this, and the aggressive ISO actually helps make the pictures look less washed out.  My DSLR does the same thing, but the difference is that ISO 400 on an $800 DSLR is a lot less noisy.  Camera makers like to advertise megapixels, but in reality 3MP of good data is plenty for 99% of all the prints people buy, so don't let that turn you off.  If I were planning on 8x10s or larger I'd be using a DSLR anyway, and even this camera will probably be OK for 8x10s even indoors - but not reliably so.2.  The form factor is wonderful.  It is completely flat when off which makes it easy to slip into a pocket, even if wearing jeans.3.  The price tag means that it is almost disposable.  Not going to be upset if it lasts at least a few trips.4.  Full auto mode works just fine in general.  I fully expect to use this most of the time.5.  Shutter is pretty snappy for a contrast-focus P&S.;  Sure, it isn't a DSLR, but I barely notice the lag in even indoor lighting.6.  If you're like me be sure to turn on the face-zoom focusing feature, and the focus review-after-shot feature.  The first feature zooms in faces when you half-shutter which lets you quickly verify the focus.  The latter shows the focus area at 1:1 in an inset when the shot is reviewed on screen which lets you see how it turned out.  No more playing with the playback/zoom buttons to check for camera shake.7.  Face detection is snappy and reliable.  Auto-red-eye seems to be hit-and-miss, but so far I didn't notice any negative effects from having it on.  My last P&S; had this feature and honestly it didn't seem to do much beyond slowing things down, but that was probably the first P&S; to have the feature years ago.8.  The low-light 2MP mode seems to work fine.  Even the 2MP is pretty noisy, but even my DSLR (a few years old) wouldn't have done any better (in fact, the SD1300 might be superior).Overall if you're just looking for a cheap camera that will take good quality shots this is a good fit.  This will not take shots remotely as nice as a DSLR except perhaps outdoor on a sunny day.  You could spend a few hundred more and get something that better handles low-light conditions/etc.  However, honestly if you're that serious about your pictures I'd probably use the dual approach of a cheap portable camera, and a good quality DSLR and flash for serious/demanding work.  Or, buy this camera for $110 right now, and then in two years buy another camera at the same price and it will probably do everything a $350 camera does today - that's just the nature of P&S; cameras.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Marilyn", "ReviewID": "R2B4YZHC6IHNJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a bit of a geek, and people frequently ask my opinion on electronics.

If you switch to Manual mode, you can change lighting (sunny, cloudy, flourescent, tungsten, etc.) and vary the ISO setting. When these adjustments are made, the camera is free to do its best, and the results are astoundingly clear and rich. While there is significant noise at 800 or 1600, setting the ISO this high may allow you to take photos in very low light without needing (or beyond the range of) the flash. Battery life is superb: took 30 minutes of video plus 200+ photos on one charge. Lack of HD video is a minus, but at this price point ($129), the camera delivers superb value and quality for money spent.

The flaps (USB port, battery & SD card compartment) feel like they could fall off with the slightest bit of pressure.- The arrow on the toggle between auto, manual and video mode is difficult to see in low light.- The autofocus on the camera is terrible, even when using the half-press to focus technique. At least half of my pictures came out blurry the first time. (Defect?)- The white balance on automatic mode doesn't work. Most of my pictures had a yellowish tint.- The flash is so bright that it whites out colors and facial featuresI compared my photos to a friends photos taken using their new Samsung TL 220 camera.

I was looking for a low priced camera so that I wouldn't be too worried if it got stolen, that also took decent pictures, had good battery life so that I wouldn't need to hold back with picture taking and that was also reasonably compact.The price is obviously pretty good. I'm not a photography expert, but for this price range I was very happy with the picture quality. Sometimes in low light the camera has trouble focusing properly. But I was mostly taking pictures outside during daytime and so that was quite rare for me. The colour in the picture almost always came out very accurately for what was being photographed (some cameras seem to produce pictures that are more yellow than the object appears in real life, for example... this camera seemed very accurate with colour). Sometimes in low light, I find that the camera modifies the amount of light captured so that the picture comes out looking more light than it actually was. This made the scene a little unnatural looking to me. I solved this by pointing and focusing the camera on a lighter area, and then pointing the camera at the object I actually want to photograph before taking the picture. I found this to be a good solution, and for a low priced camera, I am happy to concede a small fault like that. You have fairly limited control over the picture. However, I found the camera's automatic controlling of all of the parameters to produce a quite good picture about 98% of the time. It also meant that I could take many pictures spontaneously. I think this is a great \"point and shoot\" camera.I was very happy with the battery life! I think I averaged about 400+ pictures per charge, at full resolution. I kept the flash off all of the time because I think that most flash produces an unnatural looking picture. This would have helped battery life. I took this camera into the arctic circle during February and got more than 800 shots from a single charge. Maybe the cold conditions helped this?This camera has also held together well. I don't think I have ever dropped it, but it has experienced some use in heavy rain and fairly heavy use (average of about 100 shots per day) for about six months. It's still working perfectly and I've noticed no reduction in battery performance.

Oddly, this does not appear to be the case with cameras.  Most reviewers stated that the Nikon camera I had purchased was great, but most of the good reviews failed to mention how extremely slow that camera was in taking a picture.So I looked that this camera, the 1300IS, at the store.  The camera turned on quickly and took the picture very quickly too.  It seemed like a good camera so I bought it from here, Amazon, as it was on sale for around $110 at the time.I was in Las Vegas yesterday.  I tried taking pictures of my family while there.  I was surprised that the camera was so slow, as it had been real quick at the store.  It seems that when focusing on faces / people, the camera slows because it tries to focus.  So I took out my iPhone 4 (not even a 4s), and noticed that the iPhone was far quicker at focusing.  Worse, the quality of the shots from my iPhone was far superior to that of the 1300IS.Some have predicted the end of point and shoot cameras because of smartphones.  I'm beginning to think that perhaps the predictions are true.  I'm reading that the S95 is an awesome camera, but it's $300, and only shoots video at 720p.

I have tied every setting that the camera offered, and yet the images all came out acceptable the best.  On the opposite close and micro images are fantastic. For example I made picture of a bee sitting on a flower as the wind blowing like crazy and the image came out pristine clear. Awesome, yet I am incapable to make decent picture of a scenic view.

He is a concert photographer, so I am not lacking in photos around the house but too often we miss great opportunity for pictures of US, or landscape/not bands - and I needed to get myself a \"basic point and shoot\" to get the shots I want.This is an excellent point and shoot and goes beyond the basics, bringing diversity, high functionality and great quality shots at a fair price. You can go with the automatic feature, which takes all the guesswork out of a great shot, or you can throw it into manual mode and choose your own settings.Being an avid music fan myself, I go to a large number of music shows where low light mashes with bright stage lights. I have used both the camera and video features on this camera at such shows and I couldn't be happier.My favorite things about this camera:- Rarely need the flash in low light. This is a great feature because many bands don't permit flash, or at least are visibly irritated when people are flashing them every five minutes. Also prevents that washed out look that a flash can bring out.- Video picture AND sound quality are excellent, and work well in low light as well. With my previous (highly outdated PowerShot), the video sound was often muffled, with lots of noise. This is not the case with the PowerShot SD1300IS.- I love how small it is!

The 1300 is small enough to take anywhere, feels good in your hand, is well made and easy to use.The most important aspect of any camera is the quality of the pictures it takes. In my opinion, with current technology, most cameras out there today will deliver quality photos in bright light. Dim to dark conditions separate the real producers from the pack. Most small cameras do not have the ability to focus well in the dark. The tiny flash cannot create good enough light to capture great photos. This elph has really got what it takes.I attended my cousin's Bar Mitzvah. It was held in an attrctively decorated, large but dark room and everyone was in constant motion on the dance floor. My photos will tell you why I stick with Canon--see photos.That said, this is still a compact camera and will not deliver what my DSLR can.

I bought this when it was not too expensive and it has been working great. My favorite qualities about it are the options it gives you for messing around with effects. The few problems I have come across is again its fragility. Because it is small it is an item you don't want to be carrying around from a string, it is something you are going to want to buy a little pouch for when you travel with it. IT is easy to use and I have used it for multiple occasions: birthdays at home, hiking trips and everything. IT works great, the quality is superb, and even its video taking capabilities should be applauded. All in all I am very impressed with this and hope others go out and see what I and many others here are talking about. For the price, this simply cannot be ignored. Oh and by the way, like someone else said, be sure to buy a pretty good memory card for your camera, as few come with one, or if they do its pretty small.

Brusyo \"Bruz\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y1SBMT6911BD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well, this camera lasted me a whopping 3 months.  The problem with it is a combination of the sensitivity of the On/Off button + the playback button being an actual button.  In older models of the Canon PowerShot, the playback option (where you can look at your photos/videos on the camera) was part of the slider.  So whenever I would keep my camera in my pocket (and these are meant to be pocket cameras), I would make sure the slider was on the playback setting so that if the On/Off button got pressed in my pocket, the lens would not come out.  Well, with this model, the playback feature is an actual button, it's not part of the slider.  If you look at the image above of the back of the camera, you'll see that - and you'll also see that the slider gives you 3 options:  automatic camera, manual camera, and video.  So if the On/Off button gets pressed even very lightly in your pocket (it's very sensitive), the lens WILL come out... which leads to the inevitable \"lens error\"/jammed lens.  My lens will no longer either come all the way out (so that it can focus) or go all the way back in.  You cannot blame this on my handling of it, as these ARE meant to go in your pocket (I'm a guy and so I don't have a purse to put it in).  I was even aware of this potential problem as soon as I got the camera in my possession... but instead of returning it like I probably should have, I thought I'd give it a chance & be really careful when it was in my pocket.If you plan to carry this camera in your pocket, DO NOT BUT THIS CAMERA - be sure to look at images of the back of whatever cameras you're considering and purchase one where the playback option is part of the slider!", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bargain at its current price", "Author": "D. Hentze", "ReviewID": "R3FP7GI8KX3TCW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small, cheap, digital camera to put in my pocket when I'm traveling, and the SD1300 fits the bill. The size is perfect for what I was looking for, and at its new low price of just over $100, it's a bargain. The camera is simple to use. Most people won't need the quick start guide, or full manual that is included on the CD. Controls and menus are all pretty much self explanatory. The 2.7\" screen is bright and clear. Battery life is good, and I get between 200-300 pictures before needing a charge. The image stabilization works well. Outdoors, I shoot in Program Mode with i-Contrast turned \"On\", and the default settings. The camera takes very good pictures up to ISO 200, and decent pictures at ISO 400. Pictures are relatively clear, and color is natural looking. Shooting indoors is where I find using the automatic settings fail to give the best results. Indoors, the camera loves ISO 500 no matter what the lighting condition is, and the flash is turned on. This results in pictures that are more noisy and grainy than they need to be. When I shoot indoors, I use Program Mode, and set the ISO to 200. It results in much better pictures than when I let the camera chose the ISO. All in all, I find the Canon PowerShot SD1300IS to be a very good all around camera, and a great value. As long as you have reasonable expectations from a camera that packs 12MP into a tiny 1/2.3\" sensor, you should be happy with it. I give it a solid 4.5 stars.Pros:InexpensiveEasy to use controls and menusGood results under most conditions outdoorsGood battery lifeGood image stabilizationAuto Mode works well outdoors28mm wide angle lensCons:Excessive noise at ISO above 400Camera uses higher than needed ISO, especially indoorsUSB cover is very flimsyAbsolutely no internal memory/storageBasic VGA video.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "decent camera, BUT one major flaw for a subcompact", "Author": "L.

What you see in lcd view is what you get.  For years I've heard all the raves about Canon cameras, now I know why.  I owned an older Fuji s7000 which I really liked, but it's too bulky, making it impractical for most trips.  Plus the technology is old, so I needed to take many shots to get correct pix under different lighting conditions.  This camera took out all the guesswork.Pros- separate battery charger.  can charge battery leaving camera for use.- what you see in viewfinder is what you get.  this is what i love the most about this camera.  takes all the guesswork out and you can be guaranteed perfect lighting even if you ask a stranger to take your photo.  can set your lighting, iso, ev, etc. and just point and check.  no need to take 10 pix just to get the settings right like older cameras.- many modes for different lighting conditions.  I use all these modes to compensate for incandescent, flourescent, etc. Works great and what you see in view window is what the results will be so no guesswork.  This means that if you turn off flash and press shutter button halfway to focus, it will show you what the results will look like even before you take the picture and the results are practically the same!  That is amazing!- Program modes - love this feature!  Program modes takes much better picture than auto if you know how to use it well.  It's easy to figure out since you can see the expected results just by pressing the shutter halfway.  Most of my pix are taken this way and you can control the lighting.  i use iso 100 most of the time to produce best pix.  but you need a steady hand and stationary objects in lower lighting conditions.- EV setting.  I use ev to adjust lighting to make pictures more or less exposed and the results were fantastic.  again, no guesswork - you see the results in view screen even before picture is taken.  Great for producing- many resolutions to choose from- takes GREAT pictures.  In a trip, a stranger asked me to take a picture w/ a compact flat camera (i think sony brand) and the results came out horrible both times (not focused).  I'm glad I own a canon.  all my shots were always well focused and great color.- very efficient on battery life.  I took pix for many days on one fresh battery.  I keep a generic spare battery in same case and it adds almost no additional weight.- small form factor. so small, my case has so much extra room.  fits easily in my front pant pockets.- so easy to view pictures.  by using zoom dial, you can view entire album in memory.  rotate your camera and pix will automatically adjust for portrait or landscape.- good video quality.  no complaints there.Con- a bit difficult to grip, but that's probably bc it is small.- for some reason, I always accidentally press the power on button.- wish it has a longer optical zoom, but 4x is already pretty innovative at this point in time.- no manual focus, but atm, always seems to focus correctly on it's own.- kind of slow between shots.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pleased with Purchase!", "Author": "Jan Gortler Small \"junkjewels\"", "ReviewID": "R218WFRDUNEHO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We lost our Canon Camera and needed a replacement quickly.

The colors are closer to life than with other point and shoots I've owned, the image quality is pretty good except for in low light, and the optical zoom is enough for some short range zoom action.  The camera does not have a particularly quick response time for a point and shoot, which makes it hard to use with moving subjects (like little kids) but if the object isn't moving too fast, the pictures turn out reasonably well.  The autofocus with facial recognition also seems to work well for quick shots.  Finally, the size and price are the biggest selling points for me on this camera.  It's small and light enough that I can throw it in my purse and carry it around all the time.  And it's inexpensive enough that I don't mind taking it places I wouldn't want to take a DSLR--like to a day on the beach, a theme park, or handing it over to a kid for some fun photography.This is a good camera for someone looking to capture snapshots.

Schinkel", "ReviewID": "R1L3PHJ1AZEK7X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera simplifies some of the regular tasks but at the expense of its ability to take low light photos and shutter speed for action shots forcing you to miss shots.  In ideal conditions it is a better camera, but that is a rarity for me.  The video is far better than my old SD1000 camera with more frames per second with better resolution.  I also loved the frame stepping option which was wonderful when taking video of lightning.  However with photos, I was able to do far more with the SD1000 to adjust for shot conditions.  The resolution is far better which helps when zooming (which in optical zoom simply crops the photo and enlarges using the unzoomed resolution) because of the 12.1MP is much better than the old 7.1MP with the SD1000.  With shutter speed, it is best to take a picture first to prime the focus (and keep your finger on the button) then it will take pictures quickly.  However, this does not help when you have to wait over 2 seconds for the initial photo forcing you to miss quick photo opportunities.  I was able to adjust exposure but I found the light sensitivity poor compared to my SD1000.  A night vision option would be a welcome improvement.  A good option is the bulb like setting allowing the shutter to stay open.  Overall I feel it is not an improvement over the SD1000 but it could have been if they only used the same features (except for video, use the SD1300) and improve the resolution to 12.1 or higher.

I wanted something that I could have with me when I didn't feel like or think I needed to take my larger camera and/or camcorder. I especially wanted to be able to take short video clips of my children since they are at that young age where everything they do is cute and adorable. I ruled out the Flip video as a unitasker: unable to take pictures, no optical zoom, limited recording memory, no resolution other than HD (1280x720). My old computers stutter and choke when playing back these high-res files so I can live without HD.I bought and tried the Sony W350 as well as the Nikon S3000. I returned them both. This was not an apples-to-apples comparison, but close. I didn't play with the Nikon much when I realized how poorly it encoded video - soft, lacking in detail, and lots of visible encoding artifacts. The Sony was very attractive based on its specs, and I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it also had disappointing video performance. The Sony appears to use a shallow depth-of-field and so it relies heavily on its auto-focus to keep the subject sharp, near or far. However, the focus was slow, many times it would not focus on my intended subject. Even with stationary subjects, it would focus and then _lose_ focus. When it was in focus, the recording was lacking in detail and texture - I attribute this to noise reduction or the encoding smearing or smoothing them. The optical zoom worked while recording, but the microphone picks up the sound of the zoom motor. As a camera, the Sony was pretty good. It felt a little snappier than the Canon, the face detection locked in more robustly, and the smile detection worked and was fun to use. There is optical distortion on the left and right hand sides of the image. It tended to apply noise reduction very aggressively above ISO200, resulting in soft and smooth images. At IS0200 or less, the images were still softer than I'd like, and under bright daylight conditions, the colors were too saturated and a little unnatural for my taste. The flash was uneven. For standard mug shots, it exposed the subject well. For anything else, it was a crap shoot - either underexposing, or blowing out certain details of anything that was too close.The Canon SD 1300 surprisingly made far superior video recordings even though it only recorded at VGA (640x480). (Basically, the Sony's bigger numbers, 1280x720 vs 640x480, sadly didn't result in better quality.) I think it used a larger depth-of-field so more things were in focus. It never lost focus the way the Sony did, and when it had to refocus, such as going from near subject to far subject, it did so quickly. The encoding also retained much of the detail and texture. (And because it records only at VGA, it plays smoothly on my old computers.) In both cameras, exposure and white balance was very good. The video noise was comparable between the Sony and the Canon - a truly subjective opinion and a bit unexpected for the Canon. Unfortunately, you cannot operate the zoom while recording. Audio is mono, not stereo, but I don't think I matters because I find it hard to believe that you can get good stereo sound from two mics that are mounted as close as they are on these compact cameras.As a camera, the Canon was in many ways the opposite of the Sony: no optical distortion, very detailed and sharp at low ISO, reasonable at higher ISO, the flash was more even under all conditions. It didn't always recognize faces, but it still focused accurately. It doesn't have smile detection - not a big deal. It doesn't have a panorama mode - again, not a big deal. In both Sony and Canon cameras, I found the metering to be very good, and rarely blowing out highlights or shadows. Both were comparable at wide angle White balance was also very good. The camera starts up and focuses quickly. It's not as fast as my SLR, but good enough.I like the Canon's user interface, though it has some small issues. I appreciate the flexible playback modes: you can view the histogram and file info or zoom in. (I'm accustomed to doing this with my SLR to ensure good exposure and focus and make adjustments to my shooting if necessary.) The D-pad is multi-function with direct access to flash setting, timer, focus mode, and exposure compensation. I did wish I could substitute ISO setting for focus mode. Sometimes if I move too quickly or double tap a button, I end up in the general function menu instead of the direction specific ones or vice versa. However, I do appreciate all the functionality in the D-pad, I just have to be more deliberate. I like being able to set the volume for different sounds it uses. I like how it fades between pictures in playback mode.  I've accidentally turned on the camera in my pocket because the power on/off button is relatively large, raised, and easily depressed.At the time I bought this from Amazon (Dec'10), it was being sold at a great price so it was also very good value.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pics, but you definitely have to \"pose\"", "Author": "BV", "ReviewID": "R2V90U9QRBVU8D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very happy with the qualiy of pictures.

The available program modes are much less than SD880: only portrait, night shot, kids&pets;, indoor.

All good things must come to an end, right?Now I had a Fuji Film prior to my Cannon PowerShot, and I was so impressed with Cannon that I knew that there was no competition as to what brand of camera I was going to purchase as a replacement.After doing a lot of research and trying to keep within my budget I decided on the Cannon PowerShot SD1300IS.Pros: Cannon's durability, Bright Cool Camera Colors, 12 MP, crisp images, program modes [especially helpful for indoor or night time shots], rechargeable battery.Cons: 3x Optical Zoom (competitors for a lower price exceeded this), slow to take shots (delayed), frustrating wait time while changing programs.It doesn't compare to my previous Cannon, though its new perks make it fun. If I had to do it all again, I should have gone with a Nikon or waited for another PowerShot to go down in price.

The camera did not capture the ocean in the distance, but whitened it out in many cases.

I wanted a small camera with average picture quality. This camera does not take very good pictures at all.  It makes poor choices about lighting, flash, focus, \"film\" speed/grain, aperture, and exposure on auto.  The manual mode is slightly better but still provides many out of focus or fuzzy pictures.  I don't know if I have a bum camera or what, but I'm going to replace it soon.  I have previously owned the Cannon Powershot A630 and loved it.  Beautiful pictures every time.  It broke after multiple drops on concrete (not Cannon's fault).  Before that I owned Sony and Olympus point and shoot type cameras.  Both were ok but did not compare to PowerShot.

So far, this seems to be a pretty good camera and many of the features I was already used to using on my other Canon are there, but some are not as easy to locate as they are on the SD870.  That's where reading the detailed 148-page users manual will come in handy.  Unfortunately, despite reading quite a few positive reviews about the camera before purchasing it, I never noticed anyone mention the fact that Canon is no longer providing the PRINTED copy of the 148-page users manual in the box.  It's great that it is provided on a CD and is easily loaded to your computer, particularly when you have misplaced the printed copy and need to look something up, but that's not very convenient for when you are a new owner and are trying to learn to use the camera or don't have access to your computer and need to find out how to do something. I definitely want to have a printed copy of the manual, so I now have to decide if I am going to print it myself or buy a copy of the manual from someone online who sells camera manuals.  This is an unexpected expense and unexpected delay in getting up to speed on taking advantage of the capabilities of the camera.  It's only been 2 1/2 years since I bought my last Canon camera--and it came with a printed manual--so I was not aware of this obvious cost-cutting step that Canon has taken with it products.  I'm still glad that I have the camera, but I don't appreciate having to get my own copy of the printed manual.  I would have preferred to pay a bit more for the camera in order to have the manual there in the box.  FYI...If you lose the Canon CD that your manual is on and no longer have it on your computer, you can download the manual from the Canon web site and can read it online just fine, but if you have to print it out from a download you get from the Canon web site it will print with the word 'COPY' in a medium-gray color across each page.  You can, however read through the medium-gray 'COPY'.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "can i do better for $200?", "Author": "Jason \"Jason\"", "ReviewID": "R11KW1J9M3GRSV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I get that this is a compact point & shoot, and i'm not a photographer, I don't own an SLR.

I took this camera to Prom and had it in a padded pouch in my tux pocket when I wasn't using it except for once when I dropped it, but it was still in the padded pouch. When I got home I discovered that it had at least four places where the paint had been chipped off the camera. Why? I had no idea until I held it in my hand and realized that even touching it some paint was coming off! This would not have been so bad if it was the only problem with the camera, but it isn't.Other things wrong with this camera:The Iso: As one reviewer pointed out, the Iso on the default setting of this thing is very high. That is an understatement. the Iso is through the roof! the only way to take decent photos with this thing inside and out, is to go to programming mode and set the Iso differently for every different situation you are in. Not very convenient.The shooting speed: When taking a picture, it takes almost two seconds to process and display the picture you are taking. that is very slow compared to some cameras  half the price of this one. it also becomes a huge problem when you are taking pictures of a fast moving object, like an animal or car.Blur: Any time you take a picture of someone with this camera, you have to have your subject completely still! any sudden movements will cause a blur that will ruin the whole shot. For instance, when I took a picture of one of my friends dancing, the image was completely blurred!Rotating a picture: Canon is well known for allowing the user to rotate a picture by rotating the camera. On this model, when you rotate the camera, the picture either doesn't rotate or it rotates very late.Menus: The menus are very confusing. For instance, when I was looking for the Iso setting in the programing mode, I actually had to do alot of guess work before I found it. Even then the function was not named \"Iso Setting\" but something different. I can understand needing to read most of the instructions for a more advanced camera. but this is supposed to be a simple Point and Shoot. you should be able figure out at least the basic functions without them.Zoom: When you zoom in on your subject you are very limited on the distance you can zoom in. You either have  very wide view, midrange view, or very close view. there is almost no in between. the same goes for when you are browsing pictures in playback mode.I hate to be so negative, but these are my true experiences with camera and I want to warn other buyers before they throw away almost $200 on this product.
