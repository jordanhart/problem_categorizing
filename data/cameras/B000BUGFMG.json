WHITBY", "ReviewID": "R2IKQUFBZEIO5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found two photographers on flickr whose every photograph was beautiful. Each used only the Kodak CX7525. I had to have one. I found one used through Amazon Marketplace. I love it. It is the cheapest of the eight digital cameras that I own. Its photographs are every bit as pleasing. It takes good macros. The colors are always true. The photos are sharp but natural. It is light in weight. I carry it in a pocket of a photographer's vest. It cannot replace the other cameras, but it will always have a place among them.Kodak EasyShare CX7525 - Digital camera - 5.0 Mpix - optical zoom: 3 x - supported memory: MMC, SD", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera.", "Author": "John Chamberlain", "ReviewID": "R2UT4TW9EYGM10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.  It's now very cheap.  Some features I really like: (a) electrical adapter is available, and (b) adapter is available for connecting the camera directly to the television ... and viewing photos and movies ... and creating a slide show.  You will not be disappointed with the quality of photographs.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love, love, love it.", "Author": "Redbird & Runningbear's Mom", "ReviewID": "R39USYADL49B67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned 3 of these. One got stolen, I dropped one about 30 times and it finally stopped working and I have had my third one now for 8 years. Good product and great pictures for the age of this camera. I recommend it to everyone. I got a brand new camera last year for x-mas and I like this one better, easier to use, better picture quality and has good exterior quality. I just seem to drop my cameras a lot juggling 3 kids, diaper bags, purse and camera.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easyshare CX7525 Digital Camera 5MP", "Author": "Sloan Ro", "ReviewID": "R38ZKWG5JLFXBS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.
