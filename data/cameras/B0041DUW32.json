{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I like this Kit", "Author": "J.T.", "ReviewID": "R1VZ96K3CTRPIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am new at DSLR, so instead of buying a single D3100, I need to buy a kit, There are two reasons let me choose this kit: First. most of the items in this kit is useful for me, what I really need in this kit is the camera,the memory card and the bag, but after I received this kit, I found that the UV filter and the LCD screen protecter are also useful, they are good choice to protect LCD screen and Lens, and also if you don't have a card reader slot on your computer, you will also need the card reader in this kit. The second reason is the price, it is much cheaper to buy a kit than to buy these items seperatly, I compared this seller's kit with other's seller's kit also, this price is good, accturely, when I bought it, the price is around 680 dollars, it's cut now, but it is also a good price at the time when I bought it. Finally, the product is as good as discribed, and shipping service is good and fast, I got what I want.Thanks!", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "It is a good camera...my first DSLR", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R1CSGR0ZWKKOCD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It came earlier than promised!!! Good job!I am a novice when it comes to photography, but have had quite a few cameras already. I used to own the Nikon N70 and was quite happy with its performance, but then came the convenience of the POINT-AND-SHOOT. I never really like these compact ones, but my wife nagged me all the time about always wanting small and easy to use cameras. So, I gave in for the last three little ones. This time, I stood my ground and purchased this D3100 since both of my kids are in sports activities such as soccer and karate etc... The point-and-shoot couldn't do squat, but this D3100 seems to be doing the job. I am still in the play-around-with-it mode, but have shot quite a few nice action pictures. Since it is winter here in the Northeast and the sports are being played indoor now, lighting is a limitting factor and so the pics are not as great as they could be--I hope. The shutter speed is not the best, but at 3/sec is adequate for most of the situations that people commonly encounter.The included lense is fairly good and the VR feature works great. Auto-focus is relatively quick, but a bit high on the noise---this gets recorded if you do Video-recording! I recommend using manual focus during filming. I am looking for a more powerful zoom lense as I am sure the 18-55mm is not adequate out on the soccer fields....overall, I am fairly happy with its performance!", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value!", "Author": "Corey Hayes", "ReviewID": "RZJ87AA0MM8VK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome package with all items included.

The package arrived quickly, was packed very well and everything was as described. The difference was the card reader was not the same pictured. But who cares? It works and is even more compact and I like it better for that reason.As to using it - if you are new to cameras that aren't point/click/shoot do not be afraid to buy one of these.

The accessories that the camera comes with are a good complement; the case is lightweight but durable, you won't need to go out and buy an SD card, and when it comes time to clean the camera, you'll have all the tools necessary. The only things that came with the package that I was not happy with were the flimsy USB SD card reader which broke on first use and the cut-it-yourself screen protectors that have more scratches on them after you get it on than your bare screen will ever have.

I take hundreds of pictures every day and it holds up to the abuse. The carrying case is great, the SD card holds tons of pictures, the lens with filter are good, and the battery lasts quite a while. The camera its self is wonderful! I had an error message after using it for about 6 months and Nikon repaired it and sent it back for free. They even thoroughly cleaned it for me so it was like new again!Nikon is a great camera. I'm happy I made the purchase.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": "Tony J Smith", "ReviewID": "R2W9HEZFHCQX3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a more advanced camera so that I could do more with it than my \"point and shoot\" Nikon.  I still like it but this one has SO MUCH MORE to it!  I love it!  The extras that I got with it are OK but not really necessary.  The camera does NOT come with a memory card so it was nice that the extras had that but you could also buy it separately.  I tried the screen protector and either didn't get it cut quite right or something and it came off within a couple of days.  I might try a different kind.  I like having the filter that came with the \"extras\" (but you could get that separately, too).  I personally don't need the card reader but it's probably good to have it in case my computer's card reader stops working. The case is nice.  I've also ordered a telephoto zoom lens for it as the lens it comes with doesn't zoom as far as I want it to (like my point and shoot does) and I want to be able to take as good of quality photos zoomed in as I do with the regular lens.  This is a very good DSLR and I can't wait to learn more about it and play with it.  I did print out the Reference Manual at a copy place and had it bound so I have all the details on paper.  I also have it on my computer so I can access it via PDF if I want to.  I suggest also buying a 55-300 zoom lens for it.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon", "Author": "Michael D.

I do miss a few features I had on the G11 that I wished would carry over to DSLRs.  One, the viewfinder does not work for video.  When doing a lot of outdoor work in the mountains, video on the view screen is close to impossible tiosee especially if you must track something moving.  Two, I miss having live view of picture when inA,S,P and M modes.  Not that it is accurate but it is a fast way to assess lighting and how a picture might turn out--especially if you use the camera a lot during sunrise and sunset.
