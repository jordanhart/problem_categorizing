{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic camera! Incredible photos!", "Author": "Zhi Chang \"Now and Then\"", "ReviewID": "R2L6HJMJZPG8B6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using a Panasonic TZ1 for a little over two years. That's a nice 10x zoom pocket camera. But its ISO is a bit low for indoor use. The shutter lag of TZ1 also cannot keep up with my growing two-year-old twins. They move too fast for the camera to chase.My main use for the new camera is to record my kids life. From time to time, I extend my artistic interest to scenes, buildings, animals, insects, flowers...I've had this camera for a week and took over 1000 photos. It's simply fantastic.Things I like:1. The shutter response is much much better than my old camera. In most cases, it will focus quickly and accurately. I use iA mode occasionally. Most time, I set it at program mode with Fn(Function)button programmed to select different focus mode. Contrary to one of the reviewers, I feel it's very responsive. And Face Recognition really works on this Camera.2. The lens is great. You can capture incredible photos far and near.3. Wonderful IQ! I constantly mess around with different shooting modes and do comparison shot. I have to say that the iA(intelligent auto) mode in many cases is doing a better job in focusing, exposure, white balance, etc than I do(Hard to admit a machine is smart than I am. :-D). I'm still trying and learning. But I feel eventually I might give up and let the iA totally controls me.4. The menu system is well-written. I'm only half-way through the manual(Probably I'll never finish the other half). But there's not a function I hesitate to use or feel frustrated when maneuvering through the menu system.5. The lay-out of the buttons is well thought-out. I especially like the dedicated record/playback button. Why no one else thought about it. So convenient! Love it.6. LCD. This is perhaps the brightest LCD I ever had. Everything is nicely detailed.Things I think the next gen Panasonic FZ should improve:1. ISO. I have very usable photos which are shot at ISO 400. But there are several times I hope the ISO will be even higher for low-light conditions.2. Ghost-band(Purple/blue vertical lines) on LCD in strong direct light condition. This happens to many digital camera system. But I feel it shows a bit more on this camera.I frequent dpreview. A few people there(Plenty never set their fingers on the camera) complain about the small EVF of this camera. I primarily use LCD for taking pictures.  So I don't really care about EVF. But to be fair and objective, I tried EVF with about 100 photos. It's clear, bright and nice.Conclusion: It's a fantastic super-zoom camera which can take incredible photos. A nice step-up from simple P&S.; What are you waiting for? (Panasonic didn't pay me to say the last line)Update 09/30/2008: I've been using this camera for about one month. Literally thousands photos taken. Again and again I'm impressed by this camera. This is truly a versatile camera. It takes excellent photos under a broad range conditions. It's hard to go wrong with this camera.Update 12/27/2008: It's been four months since I got the camera. The more I use it, the more I appreciate its functionality, features and build quality. Best buy ever.Update 04/14/2009: I found out that my computer/camera illiterate wife uses this camera much more than I do. (Of course, she spends more time with the twins too. )She was intimated by all the buttons at the time when I bought it. Now she just leaves the setting at AI and doesn't bother to mess with anything else. Photos almost always turn out to be perfect. Nothing says more of the camera than this. Great job Panasonic!!!", "Date": "September 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "THE BEST OF ALL WORLDS!", "Author": "NeuroSplicer", "ReviewID": "R186JY7Y8FYP3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UltraZooms have came to bridge the gap between Point-&-Shoot cameras and DSLRs. They may not be the easiest to carry in a pocket (especially in the summer) but offer much better lenses, sensors and features than their cell-phone sized cousins. This is what has came to be known as the CREATIVITY segment of the camera market - and the PANASONIC FZ28 is the its absolute leader.For months now I kept borrowing my brother's FZ18 as I was researching the market for my own UltraZoom. Since this could not go on indefinitely (and my summer vacation was coming up), I decided on the NIKON P80. Although a very good camera I found it fickle and unpredictable if left on full Auto. My belief that NIKON would never put out an inferior product was confirmed but I am not a professional photographer: I missed the simplified perfection of my brother's FZ18.Luckily the Internet merchant I had bought my NIKON from offers an upgrade insurance option: for a small percentage of the total cost I bought the option of returning the camera within 12 months (provided in perfect working condition) and having it replaced with a latest model (from the same merchant of course). So, when FZ28 became available, I did just that.As with the FZ18, the Intelligent Auto (iA) setting is a dream! Perfect crystal clear pictures under (almost) any conditions, EVERY TIME. There are more tweaking options than one could desire of course, but elusive scenes often do not allow for minute setting fidgeting: a reliable Auto is a good friend in a tight moment.The older model was reported to sometimes have a problem when there were intense sunlight and shaded areas in the same shot: nothing of this sort with the FZ28. I have posted some sample photos to illustrate exactly this.The new features of FZ28 include a new sensor (10.1MP/2.33\") coupled with the also new Venus IV engine; an enlarged high quality LCD (2.7\" from 2.5\"); a wider lens system (starting from 27 instead of 28mm - but also ending at 486 instead of 504mm); a new auto-tracking focus feature; an auto backlight compensation function (missing from FZ18) and (finally!) zooming while taking video.The cherry on this cake: FZ28 comes also with a leveling function which helps align buildings or the horizon with the subject - even after taking the picture! (OK, essentially it is cropping but still...)My only gripe: as with FZ18, FZ28's zooming control is counterintuitive! One zooms IN the picture by pushing in it, whereas zooms OUT by pulling back. Well, as with the FZ18, the direction of the zooming control is in the opposite directions.

Sorry Canon, I still love you, but now I love my FZ28 better!Here are my (more than) 2 cents:Pros:---------->> 27 mm Wide angle - No more asking people to squeeze in so they can all fit in the frame! I have a Canon S5 IS too and I took shots of the same place with both cameras and the difference was striking! FZ28 wins hands down!>> 18x Zoom - Yes its only 486mm, not that much of a difference as compared to S5 IS's 432mm, but if I choose the 3MP mode instead of 10MP mode, I get 32.1x zoom, i.e. 866 mm. That's just awesome. Yes, some of you will freak at \"only 3MP resolution\", but hey, my first camera was a Canon A80 at 4MP and I have awesome 8x10 prints from that camera, so for sizes like 4x6, a 3MP resolution is sufficient unless you want to crop the image.>> HD movie recording with zoom - Note that the resolution is 720p and not 1080p. (FYI, I recorded a 4min 36 sec video today and it came to 735 MB. So its a memory hog, but with that resolution, you can't complain)>> Light weight - Yes its bulky, but at least its light>> The iA mode worked wonderfully! I took several low lighting shots without the flash and the results were amongst the best I have seen. Admittedly there was some noise (there always is at high ISO), but it was very bearable given the low lighting.>> Face recognition>> Orientation Sensor - I don't know why dpreview.com says 'no' for this. The camera DOES have an orientation sensor.>> Minimum shutter of 60 sec - I can now take some night scenes at low ISO = low noise!>> RAW mode>> Smooth opening covers for all the ports. On the S5 IS, I had to pry them open.Cons:---------->> No external flash - Not really a con for me because I don't use an external flash, but I know that many of you do, hence this comment.>> No 2 second self timer in iA (auto) mode. The 2 second timer is available for other modes.>> No flip out and twist LCD (Argh! I really like this feature on the Canon models)>> Custom battery. I much prefer using standard AA batteries that I can buy easily and cheaply in case of a battery emergency>> I took away 0.5 points for construction because I felt that the camera's exterior looked cheap when compared with that of the S5 IS. The buttons are very plastic looking and the shooting mode dial also doesn't look as sophisticated as that of the S5 IS although it functions just as well.>> I also took away 0.5 points for ease of use because I felt the menus were more cumbersome to use than Canon menus. Of course, this is a matter of personal preference but I feel Canon has done better in this regard by simple things such as putting some commonly used features as buttons, for instance, the ISO selection button.>> 2 GB limit on video recording - Argh! I still need to buy a camcorder!>> MOV format for movies - Again, personal preference. I personally prefer avi.----------That's all folks.

I must say Panasonic fz28 is a great upgrade.1 I can change the zoom when using video function, fz18 cannot. I suggest turn off the continuous AF function if you want to have a clear HD video (fz18 doesn't have HD mode).2 Set ISO Mix to 800, I got beautiful pictures with acceptable noise (better than fz18).3 The battery life is superb. I shot 380 pictures and 40+ seconds video, the battery indicator didn't turn to red yet (better than fz18).4 iA function is more intelligent than fz18, I hardly miss the scene that I want to shoot.5 LCD is larger and clearer than fz18.Finally I have to emphasize the lens again. Leica lens with 18x optical zoom, equals 27mm-486mm (10 mp), and 27m-866mm (3mp). WOW. You can shoot anything far away from you and get nice pictures (better to use tripod 12x and up).This fz28 suits all my leisure travel or family event needs. It's little bit bulky but very light, better than carrying small P&S;+ bulky DSLR + heavy camcorder bundle.I recommend fz28 to everyone.", "Date": "September 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Alternative To Pricey SLRs", "Author": "Mark Trine", "ReviewID": "RW4F1M7E7BX0M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in lieu of spending the extra money on a digital SLR. I had several reasons for this, not the least of which being the fact that digital SLRs add so many new features and enhancements to their quality each year while dropping in price. The notion of investing a good $700 or more on something that will be quickly replaced by a much more powerful model within only a year or two just didn't sit well with me. So in my search for something to get me a step up from totally novice point and shoot photography, the superzooms looked like a good option. I will eventually purchase a digital SLR, but my advice to anyone who is uncertain if they're willing to part with that much money just yet is to wait it out. Look at some of the models from only three or four years ago - they offered an average of around 7 or 8 megapixels, lacked features like image stabilization and live view LCD, and cost a few hundred dollars more than today's units. I know that if I had invested a good thousand dollars into something that is noticeably less powerful and feature laden than today's units costing hundreds less, I might be kicking myself pretty hard.This unit may be just a point and shoot but it has one of the best lenses available. It is almost comparable to an SLR in many respects. It shoots in RAW mode as well as offering one of the longest zooms in its class. I would have wished it offered a lower minimum ISO than 100 (my old Canon Powershot A610 compact offers a 50 setting) but with such a high quality CCD, the long zooming Leica lens and twice the megapixels of my old Canon it seemed a far trade off when all things were considered.The features and modes are quite numerous and of very good quality. They do well to guide even the most inexperienced users to get some great shots in various situations. I have to especially praise the intelligent auto mode above all others when it comes to beginners' usage. The camera does a surprisingly effective job at recognizing the situations in which it finds itself. (One gripe I have with this setting however is that it doesn't allow you to shoot in RAW format - it's JPEG only - more on that later.) Being more of a photo geek than the average person, I use the manual setting most often; and it's a true manual setting rather than semi-manual like many other manufacturers offer. I have full control of everything just like on an SLR. One of the features I liked best while shooting in the manual mode is that the camera's metering is active and gives you feedback for the best setting. Say for example your shutter speed or your aperture needs to be raised or lowered - the camera's meter will show that as you're focusing. Following this electronic advice gives near perfect exposures every time; but you're still free to make your own creative judgments since it is a manual mode.The menus are relatively easy to navigate considering the amount of settings and options available. I also really liked that I could choose between 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9 aspect ratios (SDTV, 35mm film, and widescreen TV respectively.)  The HD video option is a nice little extra - but keep in mind you only get about eight minutes of video on that setting regardless of how large your memory card is. Then again I figure if shooting video is a priority you would buying a proper video camera. The image stabilization works very well as do the higher ISO settings should you find yourself wanting to take a shot in the dark without a tripod. Of course you shouldn't expect to make artist grade compositions in conditions like that, but if you need to snap a quick picture of something in low light it will serve you well. I'm actually excited to see what the future holds as technology improves upon the image stabilizing and the noise reduction at higher ISO speeds. Hopefully in a few years we will start to see models that shoot some very impressive images in low light conditions. As far as long shutter speeds if using a tripod, this unit offers up a full minute. I was able to take a close up shot of a rose last night in only the light of a waning moon, and it come out so bright I actually had to darken it a little in the post processing just because I wanted it to have a night time effect.Physically speaking, this unit feels solid and employs good ergonomics. It is relatively lightweight but does pack some bulk and volume. (Don't expect to be pocketing this for everyday, everywhere random use - but that isn't the purpose of a superzoom or an SLR.) It fits nicely in the hands and has a very polished, professional appearance. Essentially it is a Panasonic SLR body with a fixed lens. Get yourself a nice bag and a few extras and you will have a very respectable hobbyist level outfit.The superzoom (18x) is wonderful. Last night I took a picture of the moon and it came out very detailed and clear. It certainly helped that the lens is threaded for 46mm filters - allowing me to use a polarizer. The autofocus system also had no trouble at all which surprised me. I thought I was going to have to manually focus an object so far away and bright. I haven't yet been able to use the long zoom for things like bird photography but I have seen images taken by other users and it seems they are quite good.But now the most important thing when it comes to investing in a camera like this: image quality. I hate having to say it, but I wasn't as impressed with the FZ28's JPEG images as I had hoped to be. I might have been spoiled by the super sharp, low noise imaging of my A610 at ISO 50, but for my money the FZ28 didn't measure up to that old Canon. The images were slightly soft, maybe a little jagged at close examination. Taking macro pictures of my corals, I noticed some artifacts that weren't present on the older images from my Canon. I was really hoping for tack-sharp details but didn't get them. The colors weren't as saturated as the Canon's, but at the same time many might welcome that fact because it gives greater post processing control, especially owing to the RAW format capability.This is where the FZ28 really shines. After being a little disappointed in the JPEG processing (a bit too aggressive on noise reduction seems to be the problem making the images too soft) I tried the RAW format and started getting the results I wanted. Straight from the camera (SilkyPIX Developer comes with the package and does a decent job) the images were near perfect. Just a little bit of processing and then an export to either a TIFF (lossless) and/or JPEG (lossy) and I have some truly great pictures. RAW format will take up quite a bit of space on your memory card but these days memory is inexpensive so carrying a few 4g or 8g cards should not set you back too much, and considering the type of camera this is I'm assuming that anyone looking into its purchase would be concerned enough with the quality of their images that the extra investment is already being considered.In conclusion, I highly recommend this unit to anyone looking to step up from their compact point and shoot digital camera to something a little more professional. While being a fixed lens unit and not entirely on par with the better SLR models, it certainly offers a very effective step in their direction for a far more reasonable price tag. Unless you're a professional or very advanced hobbyist who absolutely needs an SLR, this may be about one of the best camera choices on the market at this time. Naturally one can not future-proof themselves when it comes to digital technology, but the reasonable price of superzooms compared with SLRs makes a compelling case at this point in time. So until SLRs are closer to this price level (and they will be, albeit with more features, megapixels, and image quality than today's units) my advice is to go superzoom. Speaking for myself I would be a lot less disappointed to see something I bought for $300 or less go obsolete than I would something for which I paid upwards of $700. Canon and Nikon also have units in this class getting some great reviews. It's all a matter of choice I suppose. I went with a Panasonic, though I'm sure I would have been quite happy with the others as well.Pros - Likely best lens quality in its class, 18x zoom, threads to use filters, great array of shooting modes, intelligent auto is wonderful for effortless use, manual mode offers full user control, great image quality in the RAW format, SilkyPIX included, professional look and feel. SLR-like capabilities at a point and shoot price point.Cons - Noise reduction is a little too aggressive when it comes to in-camera image processing for JPEG format resulting in images that are a little soft and can appear a little frayed. No RAW format in auto mode. Some users may find the images less saturated than they would want. (But this is easily changed in post processing.)", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Even better than the FZ-18", "Author": "R. Taylor \"TechBob\"", "ReviewID": "RGFXPL6MHCN8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As noted in the title, I already own the FZ-18, but when I saw some of the enhancements in the FZ28, I decided to give it a try since I had been so happy with the FZ-18.  One of the greatest improvements is the resolution of the viewfinder LCD.  I feel the camera is more stable, especially at long focal lengths, using the viewfinder LCD, and thus, holding the camera close to my face.  The new viewfinder has significantly more resolution, and it actually feels like you are looking through an SLR viewfinder.  The higher megapixel resolution is also a plus, and it further brings out the crispness of the Leica lens, which has always been spectacular.  I have also enjoyed using the automatic backlighting adjustment and the ability to set a limitation on the camera's automatic selection of ISO.I have friends with digital SLRs, and occasionally they show me a picture that I simply could not take, but for the most part, my camera easily challenges theirs in all lighting, focusing and fast picture taking situations.The FZ-18 I got is black, so I decided to go with silver for the FZ-28, and it's very nice looking.  My only complaint at all with these cameras, and it's both a positive and a negative, is that they feel so light.  I guess we associate \"heft\" with quality, so the light weight of the camera makes them feel a little cheap, but it also makes them easier to carry.  You hardly know it's hanging on your shoulder.I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a lot of control, a spectacular lens and a huge range of photo taking features.

I consider myself a camera enthusiast, taking photos of mostly my travels and my children.  I originally planned to upgrade my S2 to the newest S-model being released by Canon.  I was so excited when the Canon SX10 was announced and had actually even preordered one online before I realized that it would not accept a polarizing lens.  During a recent trip to Hawaii, I had fallen in love with my polarizer and couldn't see paying $500 for a camera that wouldn't allow use of additional lenses.  I thought about upgrading to a DSLR but decided that I wouldn't like the bigger camera and expense.  Online reviews pointed me to the FZ28, and I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.The camera offers a variety of very good presets as well as full manual controls.  Noise levels are very good, even at higher ISO speeds than my previous camera would accommodate.  Overall, I agree wholeheartedly with all of the reviews previously posted, so I won't bore you with restating what has already been stated.  I did want to provide a bit of information for those of you who may be interested in using add-on lenses for your FZ28, as I don't think this has really been covered much yet in the reviews.  Unlike my previous camera which required an adapter tube AND an additional lens cap to accept a UV or polarizing filter, the FZ28 has threads on the end of the lens tube itself to accept a 46 mm lens.  The lens screws directly onto the camera's lens, extending and retracting as the camera is used.  It essentially becomes part of the camera.  Therefore, there is no need to buy extra adapter parts or lens caps in order use either of these filters with the FZ28.  When you turn off the camera, the add-on lens slides into the camera and can be covered with the camera's regular lens cap.  (As a side note, I understand that Lensmate is releasing an adapter that works with the lens hood for the Canon SX10 very soon, but it's still an additional expense and a separate piece to be used with the camera rather than becoming part of the camera like the FZ28 model.  Having personally used both a Canon separate adapter and the FZ's built-in threads, I much prefer the convenience of the FZ model's threaded lens.)  Teleconverter and macro lenses are also available for the FZ28 if desired, although I don't anticipate needing either for my own use.The pictures I have taken have been sharp and colorful, even in less than idea lighting conditions.  Even photos taken through a double-paned window at a distance were detailed (see bird and berries photo in customer's images on this site).  I haven't had an opportunity to use the video components yet.In summary, this is a great camera offering beautiful photos and seemingly foolproof options.  I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a small camera with big potential!", "Date": "November 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "From FZ18 to FZ28: worth the upgrade", "Author": "ubat", "ReviewID": "R34Q64UA7IDJPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought long and hard before buying this camera. I owned the previous model, the FZ18, and did a lot of research to conclude (or convince myself) that the upgrade was really worth it, and also to find out if there wasn't a better ultrazoom / bridge camera for me. After visiting the forums and reading reviews of the Panasonic and also of the new Nikon, Canon and Fuji ultrazoom models, I concluded that not only was it a valid buy (and gave the FZ18 to my mom, who owns an ancient Olympus camera), but also that the Panasonic was the best bridge camera out there.However, it remained to be seen whether my one big gripe with the FZ18 -- shutter lag, read my review at Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18K 8.1MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) if you're interested -- would still be present or if Panasonic had at least minimized it in the new model.The FZ28's operation is, of course, very similar to the FZ18's, so for me it was a breeze to set it up. There are only slight button changes in relation to its predecessor, but I found bigger ones in the menus, like more metering and focusing options. I referred to the manual (well organized and very easy to consult) to find the ideal configurations for me. Then I set out to do some test shots.To my satisfaction, the flying airplane that was in the middle of my frame when I hit the shutter was still in the middle of my frame when I looked at the photos in my computer. This meant that not only had I set the new camera up correctly, but that the shutter lag issue which annoyed me so much in the FZ18 has been drastically improved in the new model. This makes the FZ28 a viable camera for bird shots -- my main use for it -- and I won't be seeing photos of empty blue skies anymore.Furthermore, despite the small sensor (a characteristic all compact digital cameras share) and increase in resolution, from 8 to 10 MP, image quality has also improved. Shooting at ISO 400, the noise levels have decreased, requiring little or no post-processing in the computer. Image artifacts, like purple fringing, are still present in specific conditions -- such as shooting a dark object against a bright sky -- but much less than before. And the FZ28's handling of low-light situations has also improved considerably.The incredibly compact and light package still remains, as do the high-quality Leica optics, making the FZ28 a great all-around camera. It has lost a bit in optical zoom, from 506 to 486 mm, because the wide-angle capability has increased (from 28 mm in the FZ18 to 27 mm in the current model), but it doesn't seem to make that much difference overall. And a wider angle is nice in an all-around camera.I've taken several hundred shots in all kinds of light and distance situations, and even tried iA, Intelligent Auto, something I rarely did in the previous camera -- I normally shoot in Aperture mode -- to see how well it worked. It gave me some very usable images. So if you don't want to think about the settings and just use the FZ28 as a big zoom point-and-shoot, you'll be fine. But tweaking and controling the settings is very easy too.Battery life is still amazing, but I advise you to get a couple of spare batteries (an original Panasonic or a Digipower will do the job. There are also good reviews on the Lenmar battery, and I'll be giving that one a try). Each photo with the highest resolution and quality is around 4 MB, so several SDHC memory cards are also a good idea. I haven't tested the video capabilities yet, but I'll get around to it eventually.So far, my conclusion is: if I already liked and enjoyed the FZ18 despite its shortcomings, the FZ28 is a promising step up from that.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Jumped the fence -- finally.

That's actually not the case; it's light but solid.I would prefer AA batteries, but I can live with Panasonic's choice (especially that Lenmar has a cheap and presumably excellent replacement). After taking 50 or so pictures, playing with the settings for several hours, taking 10 30 seconds or so movies, the battery indicator hardly moved left, so I expect that the reports on the very efficient energy management are confirmed.The LCD is bright, but I prefer using viewfinder. Switching is convenient and easy. The only complain I have is the glossy surface, but I applied a screen. This is a preference, I guess; I always install matte screen on anything glossy (like my iPhone, iMac, PowerBookPro).BTW, while on Mac topics, software for Macs is included. The camera works with my Mac with no problem. The videos are in QuickTime (.mov) format, so I like it too.I like the menu system on FZ28 much more than on Canons (we own/owned a few PowerShot models). It's really easy to play with customizing pre-built photo settings on FZ28 if you want to experiment beyond the iA.The photos that I took under a variety of conditions are excellent (I settled for highest resolution with 16:9) -- as far as my completely amateur senses are concerned. Video is also great in HD 720p, and I do not have a problem with sound. My AppleTV does not do any better than 720p, so for now I am fine. The 2GB video limit (~9 minutes) does not bother me at all, since I use the video feature on a camera only for very short clips.No hesitation with giving the camera 5 stars.I also bought (and recommend after a lot of research, especially with the case):- Tamrac 3320017 Aero 20 Digital Camera Zoom Case (Black)- Lenmar DLP006 Lithium-ion Digital Camera/Camcorder Battery Equivelent to the Panasonic CGR-S006A Battery- 2 x Transcend TS8GSDHC6 8GB SDHC card (SD 2.0 SPD Class 6)", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera, i've found a nice bag for it as well.", "Author": "SammySosa21 \"sammysosa21\"", "ReviewID": "RQSILS2THBPW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The other reviews tell you most everything you need to know about this camera.

Getting into the technical aspects is best left to the experts. For people like me, the fun factor is more important, and this camera is FUN! To find a camera that does so much so very well is rare, but this one does - in spades. Features that set this baby apart from others are many and varied, from the incredible optical zoom ratios that can be attained, to the incredibly easy auto features. There are so many things that are right about this camera, that finding foibles or flaws is a real chore. I gave up looking for faults long ago. The camera also comes with some really useful software, such as PhotoFun Studio and Silkypix Developer Studio, for processing RAW shots.The camera is new, and professional reviews are scarce right now, but when they do come, I'm sure this camera will come out very well indeed. This is a camera for people who want it all in a fairly small, one-piece package. Panasonic has scored a home run with this one.In conclusion, this kind of review might not be as specific as some would like.

This is an extremely versatile camera with very good image quality. The highpoint of the camera for me is the huge zoom range it is capable of. The image stabilization works wonders at full telephoto (18x), and sharp, hand held shots in average light are very possible, if not routine.So far I have taken mostly outdoor landscape, and full zoom photos of wildlife. The landscape images are sharp and well exposed. I had a little more trouble with the full telephoto wildlife shots as many of these were taken in less than full sunlight conditions resulting in less sharpness and less color saturation than I like. I was able to do some post processing and improve many of them, though. I'm hoping as I use the camera more my technique will improve and I can get sharper telephoto shots.I also had the opportunity to use my FZ28 at a dimly lit coffee house to shoot some video and stills of a friend playing live acoustic guitar. I really wasn't able to get any infocus stills because I didn't want to use a flash and disturb the performer or the other patrons during the performance. I did take about 7 minutes total of high def video by placing the camera on the table in front of me. I was very pleased with the results. Fairly smooth video capture and decent sound considering how little light was available. I am going to make a DVD of the videos for my friend.I have also shot some macro photos with impressive results. This thing focuses so close it is like having a 10MP microscope! My friend asked me to take an extreme close up of his eyeball (weird, I know). His ophthalmologist has got nothing on these photos! They are amazing. I converted the photo to black and white and cropped it super close for him. He has it as his desktop background on a 22\" monitor! Very striking.The reason I didn't give this camera five stars is there is a fair amount of noise present in all photos even at low ISO settings. I have a large format 13\" x 19\" printer so I am more aware than most people of the effects of noise on a large printed photo. I have to do a fair amount of software smoothing (which results in a loss of detail) to be able to print clean photos at that size.In addition to the noise problem, I also have had some issues with recording video with the camera (or subject) in motion. If I slowly walk around my apartment taking video in average daylight the camera has a very hard time following the motion and staying in focus, especially if I zoom in and out some. I love the HD video option but I am disappointed the output isn't a little better. Also, it is important to buy the fastest SD card you can afford. I have an \"A-Data\" 8GB Class 6 \"Turbo\" SDHC card (cheap: $17.50) and I have had the camera stop after recording about 45 seconds of HD video, and give me an error message saying my card is not fast enough to keep up with the video capture. This only happens occasionally and I think it must depend on what you are taking the video of. I didn't have any trouble taking video at the dimly lit coffeehouse but I got these errors outdoors at full zoom while taking a video of a seagull having a snack.Even with those 2 problems I heartily recommend this camera, and from what I have read it is the best in the long zoom consumer camera category.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "All in one, One in all, Everyone", "Author": "David Golynskiy \"irock12\"", "ReviewID": "R1LH896XX8LTDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As many people said before me, this camera is great! I received it from OneCall a few day ago in perfect condition for a low price. It was new in the box and was delivered right on time. Trying on this camera was a similar experience. It is great!  I am not a professional photographer, I just like to have a versatile camera that can do it all. First off, it has great picture quality in most given conditions. I made most of my pictures inside of my house to test low light conditions and it handled it well. Previous cameras I used always made pictures with yellow tints from indoor light. FZ28 has a party and indoor portrait mode which can eliminate that. And if that is not it enough there are manual settings that can be tweaked in every way.IA MODE:  Perhaps the greatest part of this camera is the intelligent auto mode. It is the best one I have ever seen. I would say, 9 out of 10 using IA were perfect. Its not 100%, but what is?FOCUS:  I am also very impressed with the focusing abilities of this camera. It is very good considering the 18x zoom. Sometimes is takes a little bit to focus well, but once it does it is great.MOVIE:  The movie mode is very good on this camera. It is high quality and there are 5 different quality setting. To use HD make sure you have a fast SD card.SIZE:  It is clear that you will not be able to fit this camera into your pocket. However, it depends how much size means to you. Personally it took me a long time to decide to get this camera and I am surprised that it is actually very small for its parameters. It gives A LOT for its size. So I suggest if you have somewhat of an issue with size but really want a lot for that sacrifice. Buy the camera. Its really not so good to carry a camera in a pocket anyway.OUTDOOR PICTURES:  WOW. WOW. WOW. Outdoor, sunny, well lit places are simply phenomenal!!ZOOM: 18x optical zoom with 10 megapixel? Heck Yea. And up to 32x optical zoom (125x with digital zoom) on lower megapixel settings (7, 5, 3).IMAGE STABILIZATION: Panasonic has the best OIS in my opinion. At 18x the manual says a tripod is required, I find otherwise. With OIS mode 1 the picture is stabilized with the shutter button halfway pressed. You can still take a great picture if you can limit your shaking hands.OVERALL: There is still so much to write about this camera. I am very satisfied with it. It has all functions in a relatively small body. Every picture is great because it could also be tweaked with RAW editing software. Finally, it is easily adaptive to any user. My whole family can use it. I read the manual and set a few custom modes that my parents will most likely use. One for my brother and one for my self. In the end there is still a great auto mode and raw editing.I have some sample pics uploaded.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera for a cameraholic", "Author": "Evelyn A.

I got this camera looking for two things... I wanted the extended optical zoom and I wamted to shoot infocus photos of my dogs running that were large enough for me to crop and still print 8 x 10's with.  I have owned and still own several digital point and shoots as well as the Rebel Xti, and each has it's own special use for my shooting purposes, however a \"stop action\" point and shoot and a good zoom were missing.

Got this camera yesterday, shot 200 photos with it on a fairly dark, cloudy day, and I LOVE it.  It's fast, crystal clear with the great Leica lens, and the zoom is all it's advertised to be and more.  Exposure couldn't have been better.  I mostly used the intelligent Auto mode, but did play around with some other settings just to learn about the camera. Only two problems... I had a bit of a problem with the camera telling me something was in focus and it wasn't when I reviewed the photo...and, I kept missing the running dogs since the camera fired just before they came fully into view... guess that is positive and means it's faster than I realize???  Both these problems will resolve with more use of the camera I am sure.  I would also prefer an automatic pop-up flash rather than this one that I have to physically open to use.

When I got it in the mail and opened it up, I wasn't disappointed. The silver camera is just beautiful! I own a Canon sd870, which I love and keep in my handbag at all times since it is so small. I was in the market for something with more manual control and a greater zoom. I didn't want a DSLR because of the price and having to purchase and carry around additional lenses.

I also invested in a decent tripod - you can get much better shots using the zoom if the camera is steady. The pictures I have been getting with this camera are vibrant and beautiful.

One drawback is the shutter lag is waaaay to long.  The quality of image is a 10.  Buy an extra battery (PANASONIC ONLY NOT A LOOK-ALIKE).  If you are going to shoot RAW get a 8G SDHC card. Shooting JPEG only using a 4G card gives you 700+ pics.  Shooting RAW+JPEG gives you 200!!  If you don't know why the FZ28 is a little pricey IT IS THE LEICA OPTICS.

I needed a bridge camera to hold me over until the full frame sensor SLR bodies become more affordable.  I am a low and natural light junkie and this is my first digital camera purchase.  It's low light, still and video performance is much better than your typical point and shoot which is what I am comparing it to. (That means I can live with it).  I've only had it 3 weeks and I am still learning.Things I like.-I love this lens!  At this price point you will not be able to find a lens anywhere that is this good.  This is an enormous zoom range and there is very little distortion or color error at it's zoom extremes.  No, it's not perfect, but I think they hit the perfect compromise between cost and performance.  If they had tried to stretch this zoom any further, like to say 20X, I think they would have ruined it.  Zooms with this range give up a lot and this one gives up as little as possible.  To see what I mean, take a sheet of aluminum foil (shiny side up) and crumple it into a ball and lay it in bright, high noon sun.  Then photograph it at full zoom and then look at the shot with the 16X digital zoom and you will see very little color. Mostly a little bit of violet or light blue.  If I photograph a white bird in bright sun, I get a print of a white bird.  I am not suggesting this is APO performance, just that this is a very good lens on a camera that only cost me $257.00.  It stands out among it's competitors.-I like the flash...it's good enough that I don't need or want an external flash.  So far the furthest I have tried is 26 feet in a darkened room and it did fine.  Some burn out on close up light colored objects but I am still in the learning process. With a partial discharge or used as a fill flash it recycles quickly.  (In comparison to its competitors).-I like having manual controls and the ability to do time exposures.  (the limit is 1 minute) And I like the overall flexibility of the programs.  I like the Intelligent Auto mode and find it gets it right most of the time.  Color balance is great.  Shots taken under store, office, and home lighting look just fine. I have not gotten the swing of the aperture and shutter priority modes yet.  I am still struggling trying to translate this digital language into the 35mm film language in my head.-I like the viewfinder and being able to adjust it for my eyes.-I am impressed with the battery life and like it that the camera came with everything I needed but the SDHC card.-Overall I like the quality of the video.  Units made after July 2008 got an upgraded sound system (according to the insert in box) and my videos can't be played on cameras made before that date.  The sound is not great but it's OK.  We were on the tarmac at Dekalb Peachtree airport and I was filming the news helicopters coming in at the end of the day.  They were about 250 feet away and I could still hear my sons voice and the voice of one of his flight instructors over the sound of the choppers.  I did not get to listen to the older version of this camera so I can't make a comment by comparison.-The speed of the camera...sometimes it's fast as lightning...more on that.  I am using a Panasonic class 4 SDHC memory card (minimum recommended speed for HD video).  The class 4 card sped up the time between shots quite a bit as compared to the internal memory. So I'm going to order a class 6 card and see if it goes any faster between shots.-Super light weight.  (The Canon was a monster to lug around). I can carry it for hours without issues. Not around my neck but in a jacket pocket or on my hip.Things I don't like.-To my dry winter hands it is a little bit too slippery to hold.  I wish it had a rubberized body.  My perception of the build quality is that if I drop it 4 feet onto concrete I am going to do some serious damage. I would be surprised if it survived. To be fair though, in the past, when I have dropped electronic items, the lighter the object the better it tends to fair.  It just feels and looks like hard plastic and not at all like the Canon SX10IS.-The focusing is maddening at times.  Usually it is really fast...and then other times it slowly goes all the way in and then all the way back out before locking.  I have not had it long enough to figure out a way around this but it bugs me.  I almost bought the Canon SX10IS over it because of this.-The internal menu screens do not follow a consistent pattern from one program to another so I can spend a lot of time hunting for what I want.-In the video mode any point of light that is a bit brighter than the back ground will cause a vertical light streak.  The landing light on the channel 46 news helicopter caused a vertical streak and it was still daylight.  The Christmas tree lights caused vertical streaks in a darkened room.  If I brighten the room a bit before filming to eliminate the contrast the streaks disappeared.-I would have liked a folding LCD screen for when I am holding the camera above my head.  The quality of the LCD is just OK by the newest standards.Summary:  I am happy with it and would buy it again. It's a feature rich camera that takes great pictures.  (And the video is not to bad).  It can't match SLR performance and does not pretend to.  Super zooms are a bundle of price/performance/bulk and weight compromises.  I could find no other camera that had a zoom with this range, with a lens this clean and fast, in a body this light, with a flash this effective, with such good battery life and with so many useful features, in a package this compact and at this price point.  Those features make me willing to put up with some of its fussiness.  It is what it is and I like it.  And I can tell from the recent upgrades that Panasonic is listening...UPDATE:  7-23-09  I have found a color that the camera's sensor can't quite reproduce accurately in auto.  Home Depot sold a New Guinea Impatiens flower this season (Vigoro brand line) in the color \"Crushed Grape\"  This is a brilliant, glowing, luminescent grape color between violet and purple.  I have tried to photograph it in sun, shade and with the flash and the reproduction is always off.  Way off.  I did not tamper with color saturation to try and fix it since it did not look like a saturation issue.The included software is not working smoothly with my version of Windows XP and I can't figure out a way to burn photos to a cd.Still happy with my purchase.", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great DSLR Replacement", "Author": "W.

Scenery modes mostly work, sometimes (rarely) needs a little tweaking, but not allowed much leeway.RAW and RAW+JPEG Saves really take time (almost 2 secs each shot) while JPEG only Saves is much, much faster (less than a sec.)Manual can be difficult to find things in later, better to go through the manual with camera in your hand and try things as you read.ISO above 800 can get grainy but acceptable.Features I'm drawn to - Quick menu joystick is handy when not in auto or scene modes; ability to do RAW if needed; histogram, scene and exposure-sharpness controls, autobracketingit's not a DSLR, but close on most control abilities.Video is OK but not the strong point here, camcorder has better controls and capacity.Update 10/31/08 - I just came back from month-long trip and took over 3000 pics and several dozen videos and want to add further comments.Battery life - With the camera continually on with 5 min power save, battery life is about 300 pics - roughly 4 to 6 hours as a tourist taking intermittent pictures, so a second battery is needed for a full day shooting.

(EVF)  This is great in brightly lit outdoor situations where the LCD is hard, or impossible, to see.  (though I haven't had that issue too much with the LCD on the FZ28).  I won't buy another digicam without an EVF or a regular viewfinder.  Too many times I've been stuck where I can't see what I'm taking.5)  10mp.  This isn't super important, but it helps when you want to get some shots that came out blurry at 10mp but look fine whene scaled down, so you can still get a nice 8 x 10 out of it.  Having said that, I shoot at 3mp or under most times, for regular family and fun shots.  Anything serious or artsy, go the full 10, perhaps.6)  HD video with ZOOM capability!!!  Very few cameras allow zooming.  The quality is excellent even in normal indoor lighting.7)  Great LCD.  Big and hi-res.And more.  Like great controls; SMALL camera and very lightweight.  Fits in a fanny pack.  Comes with a lens hood, for sunny outdoor shots.  Lecia lens!!  Fantastic.  Quick and responsive.  USes SDHC cards.  Great battery life.Truly, this is a no-brainer.

How could this happen?  I am a longtime Canon user and had set out to buy another Canon.  A month later, Digital Photography Review named the FZ28 and SX10 IS joint winners in its Super Zoom group test and gave both cameras highly recommended ratings.  [...]The Super Zoom review helps explain how I had picked the FZ28 over the SX10 IS.  There is a little edge for the SX10 IS for having slightly better image quality, a little more zoom, a larger optical magnification, a larger viewfinder, a vari-angle LCD and a flash hot shoe.  But, prints made from images with the FZ28 are very high quality and have no purple fringing from images made at the longest zooms like the prints from SX10 IS images have.  Also, the LCD of the FZ28 is slightly larger for a little better viewing and the SX10 IS lacks two very important features that the FZ28 has: Raw image format (Raw) and high definition (HD) movie recording.The FZ28 is also lighter than the SX10 IS, especially when carrying extra batteries.  The SX10 IS weighs 800gr. (28.2oz) with a spare set of four AA batteries for approximately 1200 still images using NI-MH rechargeables.  The FZ28 uses Lithium rechargeables and weighs 507gr. (17.9oz) with two spare battery packs for approximately 1380 still images.Anyone who has ever carried a Canon PowerShot A610-640 series camera will be pleased to find out that the FZ28 has the same carry weight as the A600 series and a comfortable old school feel.  Somehow, Canon left out an upgrade replacement for the A600 series and Panasonic filled the vacancy with much more camera with Super Zoom and other advanced features in the FZ28.I can add little to the other favorable reviews written except:* For changing menu settings and aperture and shutter values quickly, the Joystick is easy to use if it is moved deliberately and not too hurriedly.* The FZ28 is ideally lightweight to carry while walking or hiking and also to use on a monopod to brace it, especially for the longer 12x to 18x zooms.  The 11x zoom approximates a focal length of 297mm which is about the longest lens that I can use handholding a camera and focus without some image shake.In making his arguments to reject the FZ28 in what is considered the most helpful critical review, Mark Justice Hinton \"mjh\" appears to somewhat confuse optical magnification with zoom ratio and apparently he is unfamiliar with Raw in some popular Canon cameras.  Out of a sense of fairness to existing and potential future owners of the FZ28, the \"mjh\" review deserves these rather basic clarifications and rebuttal:* Magnification and zoom in a variable lens are different parameters, but both are related to focal length.* Magnification is quantified as the maximum focal length of a zoom lens divided by the focal length of a normal lens.  A normal lens approximates the field of vision of human eyes and 50mm (35mm equivalent) is the approximate normal lens for digital cameras.* The magnification of the FZ28 is 486mm / 50mm = 9.72 and the magnification of the DSC-H5 is 432mm / 50mm=8.64.  The actual magnification difference between the DSC-H5 and the FZ28 can be seen by zooming the FZ28 to 16x its 432mm position and then to 18x for its maximum focal length of 486mm.  The FZ28 increase in magnification over the DSC-H5 is a modest 9.72 / 8.64= 1.125 or 12.5%.* With the larger LCD of the DSC-H5, it was possible for \"mjh\" to see an in-camera image at the maximum focal length of the DSC-H5 as being approximately the same size as an in-camera image at the maximum focal length of the FZ28.  The LCD of the DSC-H5 being 22% larger in area than the LCD of the FZ28 would make it more difficult to see the difference in the two cameras' magnifications.* What \"mjh\" seems to refer to as the \"vagaries of the x factor\" in comparing zooms is the range of focal lengths from the shortest (widest angle) to the longest (maximum telephoto) lens.  The range of lens focal lengths is commonly referred to as the zoom ratio and is 18:1 for the FZ28 and 12:1 for the DSC-H5.  The shortest lens of the FZ28 is 27mm and its longest lens is 486mm and 486mm / 27mm = 18 focal length positions each 27mm apart.  The FZ28 with 18x zoom has six more useful focal length positions than the 432mm / 36mm =12x zoom of the DSC-H5 does.  If one compares zooms without confusing zoom with optical magnification, the FZ28 starts its 1x zoom with a true wide angle of 27mm to capture more surrounding area in an image than the DSC-H5 does at 36mm and has 18x-12x=6x or 50% more valuable focal length positions (lens) than the DSC-H5 has.* It is unclear how \"mjh\" determined that the DSC-H5 Auto mode captured a brighter image than the FZ28, but it is likely that he was comparing images using both cameras' LCDs in PLAYBACK.  If so, it is doubtful that \"mjh\" set the FZ28 LCD mode to POWER LCD using the PLAYBACK menu.  One has to use the PLAYBACK and not the RECORD menu to change the LCD mode if the FZ28 is in the Auto (IA) mode.  The FZ28 default LCD mode is AUTO POWER LCD which is not nearly as bright as POWER LCD.* Contrary to the opinion of \"mjh\" that it is \"crazy\" and \"unacceptable\" for the FZ28 not to have Raw in Auto (IA) mode, I would have been surprised to find Raw could be used in Auto (IA) mode.  Auto mode is simply Point and Shoot mode and gives a camera almost total control over all its settings.  Not having Raw in Auto mode has been standard in Canon cameras models that I know about.  Neither the G10 nor the G9 have Raw in Auto mode.  The EOS 40D SLR does not have Raw in the Basic Zone which includes Auto mode, and Raw can only be used in the Creative Zone which has the manual, program, aperture and shutter control options.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "If you already own a super-zoom...", "Author": "mark justice hinton \"mjh\"", "ReviewID": "R29M1AYQMI3RWG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you have not yet owned an ultrazoom (10X or higher), you will probably like the FZ28. It's a nice camera, smaller and lighter than my Sony, but loaded with features and options.In the past 6 years, I have owned 3 or 4 digital cameras. One or two years ago, I bought a Sony DHC-H5, primarily for its 12X zoom, which was a stunning improvement over the 10X I previously owned. I was one click away from buying the Sony DHC-H50 when I started reading rave reviews about the Panasonic Lumix FZ28. A bit of research convinced me to buy it from Amazon. In less than 24 hours, I returned it. (I admit I should have given it more time, but my basic disappointment would not have changed.)There is a gotcha in comparing zooms. A 12X is not necessarily 20% better than a 10X. The X factor is based on the unzoomed wide angle lens. The FZ28 has a much wider lens than the H5. On the plus side, the FZ28 will capture more of the scene before you because of that wide lens. However, that wide angle lens means 18X isn't as much of a zoom as one might think.To truly compare lenses, you must look at the 35mm equivalents for each lens. The 18X FZ28 zoom maxes to 486mm; the 15X H50 is 465mm. Both should reach farther than the 12X H5 at 432mm. But in careful testing, taking pictures from the same spot with the FZ28 and the H5, the zoom shots were virtually identical. (Actually, the H5's auto mode captured a brighter image than the FZ28, but the zooms were undistinguishable.) Because of the vagaries of the X factor, I didn't expect a huge improvement, but I still expected to be wowed and I was not. And by not being wowed, I was disappointed, even though this zoom will wow anyone who hasn't used another long zoom.I considered hanging on to the FZ28. It has many newer features lacking on my older H5, such as face detection and smile detection. Unfortunately, the LCD is smaller and less sharp than the H5.The tipping point was a rather minor feature, ironically. Most cameras record JPEGs, which is fine for most uses. A lot of high-end cameras shoot RAW format, which stores much more information than a JPEG. That info can be very useful in a powerful photo editor. Frankly, I crop and make minor tweaks that work fine in JPEG format. But, the fact that the FZ28 offers RAW + JPEG (one shot, two pix) tipped me towards the FZ28. And back again.You cannot shoot RAW if you use the fully automatic mode (Intelligent Assist). I can't understand why that is so, but it is true. So, if you want RAW, you forego auto and vice versa. Crazy. Unacceptable to me, as minor as my interest in RAW is.I'm not trying to steer anyone away from the FZ28 except for someone like me who is trying to pick between it and another camera and is swayed by the 18X zoom and RAW format.

I've had mine for three months and have shot over a thousand images ranging from macro to full telephoto, mostly portraits, sports, landscapes, & wildlife, and I'm very satisfied with it.The other 5 star reviews cover all of the features very well, so I just want to highlight the features that stand out compared to other top-end \"prosumer\" cameras.PROS:* The FZ28's in-lens Image Stabilization is extremely effective, much better than cameras with \"camera body\" IS.  The weak point of any non-dSLR is poor performance in low light; IS gives you back 2.5-3 stops for handheld work so you don't need to go to ultra high ISO to get the shot.  It also greatly reduces the number of blurred shots in normal light.* The AF and shutter are quite fast and the \"next shot delay\" is smaller than with many other cameras in the same price range or higher.  (For example, the next shot delay on my Nikon 8700 is at least twice as long, enough to make me miss a lot of shots.)* If you are shooting JPEGs, you are at the mercy of your camera's built-in software,  Most will smear details badly, especially when reducing noise at higher ISO settings, and some create a lot of color fringing in the process of over-sharpening.  The new Panasonics and Canons start with better lenses than most and mis-process the JPEGs less than any others I have seen.  I used to shoot RAW exclusively, but now I switch to JPEGs when I need to shoot quick sequences.  Having both RAW and excellent JPEG options in the FZ28 is the best of both worlds.* For ease of use the FZ28 is tops in its field.  I tried all the contenders, and even though I was much more familiar with Nikon, Canon, and Olympus, the Panasonic had the simplest, most logical layout, menus, and controls and proved to be the easiest to learn and use.  It's also one of the lightest (maybe THE lightest) in its class, making it very easy to carry everywhere.* Part of ease of use is that when you are in a hurry to get a shot, you can pick a scene type or go full auto (IA) and just wing it and you will normally get results every bit as good as you can get by fiddling with the settings.  I used all-manual 35mm and medium format cameras for 25 years, so admitting this is kind of hard, but damn, this camera is smart!  One reason it is so good is that scene and face detection really work well.  This means, for example, that when you are shooting in auto mode, the FZ28 focuses on the faces even if they are off-center.  No more taking pictures of two people and finding that the AF or AE locked on a bush between and 30 feet behind them!* It's one of the few cameras in its class that can take HD video.  The video quality is excellent and AF and stabilization are effective in video mode.  On the other hand, the sound quality drops off quickly with distance and file size is large, as you would expect for 1280x720@30fps.* Good Mac-compatible image processing software is included free.  The RAW converter is at least as good as Adobe's.* Reliability:  CU rates Panasonics best on frequency of repairs.CONS:* No PC connector or hot shoe for off-camera flash.  (This is only a minor drawback, since you can get slave strobe units that can be triggered by the built-in flash.)* No swing out LCD screen.  This was almost a deal-breaker for me, and I still miss it.  I find that I use the viewfinder all the time for shooting now, which means a bit more stretching and bending for high and low camera angles.  Fortunately, the FZ28's viewfinder is bright and easy to use, even for us old trifocal wearers.  Some P&S; cameras have such awful viewfinders that you almost have to use the LCD, a big problem in bright light.CONCLUSIONAt the moment, the nearest competitor to the FZ28 is probably the Canon SX10 IS.  The Canon has some advantages, notably a hot shoe, a great viewfinder, a swing-out LCD, and slightly sharper jpegs.  On the down side, the Canon is MUCH bigger and heavier, almost the size of an SLR, its images have quite a bit of color fringing, the video is limited, the lens gets fairly dim (f/5.7, a full stop darker than the FZ28) at full telephoto, and it can't shoot RAW.  (RAW requires post processing but generally produces better quality images.)  If you don't care about those negatives, the Canon is a good choice.  They are important to me, so the Panasonic was the hands-down winner for me, but you can make great pictures with either one.  (If you need RAW, but can live with a very short 5x zoom, the Canon G10 is another decent alternative.)For more info, see: [...] [...] [...]You can also go to Flickr and search on camera names to find groups and check out images taken with different cameras.  E.g.:  [...]  [...]  [...]IF IT'S THAT GOOD, IS IT BETTER THAN A DSLR?The key is, better for what?  _IF_ you don't need to shoot in very low light, or shoot very rapidly for extended periods, or make 20\"x30\" prints, then yes, for the first time, we can say that the new top-end point&shoot; cameras are better than a lower-end dSLR.  There's a lot of snobbery about dSLRs, and there's no question that pros need to have them for several reasons, but if none of those special requirements apply to you, I would unhesitatingly go with the FZ28.Of course, even a cheap dSLR, equipped with decent image stabilizing lenses to cover the same range of focal lengths, is going to cost at least 4 to 6 times as much as an FZ28.  That's a lot to spend for status if you don'tt have to.  And then there's another advantage of a high-end P&S; over an SLR.  Any camera with interchangeable lenses has a major weakness:  dust on the imaging sensor.  It can mess up an entire shoot without your knowing it.  Non-SLRs like the FZ28 are sealed and don't have that problem.Finally, remember this:  THE CAMERA YOU HAVE WITH YOU WILL TAKE INFINITELY BETTER PICTURES THAN THE CAMERA YOU LEFT AT HOME!  A dSLR with 2 or 3 big lenses and associated gear is just too heavy and too bulky to carry around with you everywhere.  It's also too conspicuous and too expensive to risk in many places.  For both of those reasons, the top end Canon and Panasonic superzooms are becoming the favorite everyday, walkaround cameras for a lot of pros as well as serious amateurs.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R1E2Q11XFXI5HL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It really is extremely difficult to take a bad photograph with the Panasonic Lumix FZ28K.

Downsizing to 3MP file sizes you can actually zoom up to 32.1 X which is just incredible!

Panasonic use Leica Brand lens on the FZ28 which is built in Japan under strict Leica Supervision. The resolving power of the lens is second to none. Its colour is vivid yet not overwhelming. Its detail presentation is almost impeccable to the finest degree, especially in shadow area. Yes, I agree that photoshop can do amazing things to a picture and can almost turn it 180 degreee around. However, no matter how good an editing software is, it still has to rely on the fundamental information captured by the lens.

The first order was sent through Fed Ex & USPS and this information about FedEx is not available online through Amazon tracking.  It seems that Fed Ex initially handles part of the shipping aspect and then transfers it to USPS for delivery.INITIAL THOUGHTS OF THE FZ28:1.) I've waited since the release and finally purchased even after comparing this to the Canon SX10 IS.2.) The fz28 is not as small as i expected.  After watching numerous online reviews and videos i was under the assumption that this was somewhat smaller than it actually is.  This is not a problem for me, but can be for someone who wants a P & S camera that fits in their pocket.3.) It's lightweight and has a plastic body, but does not feel cheap in any way. Also, it's constructed very well and the buttons are logically placed.4.) The zoom button is the opposite of what i was used it.  To zoom in you turn the button to the right, unlike to the left some of the other cameras I've used.5.) Make sure to take off the lens cap because the lens does extend outwards when you turn the camera on.  This happened the first time i used it and can be an issue in the future.  Currently, I've switched to a clear UV filter which helps protect the lens from scratches and dust.  I haven't tested it for reduction in glare yet, but the filter was purchased primarily to protect the lens.6.) Battery(rechargeable) life is very good, but i bought a spare one from amazon just in case.  Also, the fz28 uses an external battery charger and can not be charged directly though the camera.  Make sure to charge the battery when you receive it because it doesn't come pre- charged.  Recharge time is about 2 hrs.7.) Very strong flash, but can be adjusted depending of the shooting conditions.  It's strong enough to effectively illuminate a large room(20x20 or larger?)PICTURE AND VIDEO QUALITY:The picture and video qualities are outstanding for P&S; camera.1.) Personally, manual mode provides the best picture quality(especially when using zoom).  Using this, you can adjust aperture and shutter speed to suit your needs.  Also, i use IISO(Intellgent ISO)in manual mode(adjusted in menu) which is effective in most situations.  If your in a hurry and want to take quick shots then the IA(Intelligent Auto) mode would be a better option, but does not give you the best possible pic quality in low light shooting(if your not using flash and are using zoom).  If you can use flash for low light situations then it's not an issue in IA, but this is limited to close range shooting.2.) I was able to take several clear pics using the full 18x at 10mp without a tripod.  Although this was outside during the daytime.  For night time and low light shooting look at the previous section.  Just for reference, the degree of optical zoom can be increased by decreasing the mp.  For example, a reduction from 10pm to 5mp provides an increase from 18x to 25.7x.  Be aware that this variance does not make much of a difference.3.) I have not used Raw format but it's available. The camera also comes with the necessary software to open and process RAW.4.) Video quality on HD mode is amazing especially coming from a P&S; camera.  You can even use WVGA(844 X 480 i think) mode and it will still give you dvd like video quality.  Granted, it's not the same as HD, but is a nice option in case you need to take longer clips.  I have an 8gb class 6 card which can hold about 40-50 mins HD video and 95-100 mins in WVGA.  The actually time will vary depending on the shooting conditions.  Personally, i will use WVGA for the time being until i purchase a 16gb or larger sdhc card.18x optical zoom is available during video mode, but is a little slow.  Also, there is a slight motor noise during zooming which can be heard on the videos if you really pay attention.  The noise is very faint and is not a major issue.5.) The sound quality is surprisingly quite good for a P&S; of this price range.  I already knew about the audio issues when it first came out, but since then Panasonic made an upgrade to the audio system.  The upgrade is only available for cameras manufactured after a certain date last year(i think Dec '08).ACCESSORIES I PURCHASED:Large Camera case(Ebay), Lenmar battery(Amazon), UV filter(Amazon),and 8gb & 4gb SDHC class 6 memory cards.  Might be better to purchase 8gb or larger if your considering taking video(especially HD).  Also, it's a good idea to purchase 2 or more memory cards due to their high defect rate. Make sure to backup all pics and vids to another source like a HD, DVD, or flash drive to prevent accidental loss.OVERALL:Since I've received the fz28, i have yet to be disappointed in any aspect.  In my perspective, this is the best camera on the market especially at the $250-300 price range.  For those who are considering this camera or are in the market for on, make sure to check the reviews and videos(youtube) to assess your needs before you make your decision.  I hope this review was at least somewhat helpful in guiding your decision.  I would like to say thanks to everyone who have written reviews on here and made videos(youtube) which helped me in my decision process.

By the time you read this all model numbers will change so there is no point in being more specific.I'm glad we bought the Lumix DMC-FZ28K.

The lens is much better than I expected, and with 10 MP to play with, even wide-angle master shots have enough resolution for cropping.I have no real complaints with the camera per se. I wish it had barn doors over the lens, but then again, no competitor has them either, and they would drive up size, weight and cost.My feedback is that the camera, like its competition, has just too many modes for most users. Five or six modes are all 99% of users will need. I love the movie feature and thankfully Panasonic chose MOV over AVI or Real format. But the mode dial is so crowded with all these frivolous choices that getting from IA (default) to movie or other significant mode is not easy especially when lighting is poor. The reality is that this market is very competitive and each manufacturer tries to cram in as much as possible to the detriment of usability. Some company is going to have to find the courage to make these digicams user-centric, not market-driven, and explain the reasoning to the consumer.

My other camera is a FujiFilm FinePix F20, which I absolutely LOVE, but it's a tiny little camera and the zoom has it's limits. Although the picture quality of the FinePix is phenomenal, I wanted something with a better zoom and better quality video ability. I did my research and discovered the Panasonic DMC-FZ28. Some of the features that sold me on it were the Leica lens, multiple picture taking modes, image stabilization and a 486mm zoom in a portable point-and-shoot camera. I'm still experimenting with the MANY features this camera offers and have barely scratched the surface of what it can do, but so far, I'm VERY impressed and would recommend this camera to someone who wants a lightweight camera with an excellent close-up zoom, clear pictures and great video capability. There are some additional lenses offered for this camera and I will definitely consider them for an ever closer zoom and more options.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "pooman \"pooman6\"", "ReviewID": "RWT2SPYY1RL8M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I know people will cringe when I say this but just put it on auto and shoot.

Digital is the way to go.  But the image quality of my two previous digital cameras wasn't really great.  My previous digital camera was the Panasonic DMC-FZ15 (4 Meg, 12X zoom).  I was thinking of moving up to a DSLR (Cannon or Nikon) but couldn't bring myself to spend that kind of money or have to go back to multiple lenses.  So I read some reviews of the FZ28K and decided to try it since I was reasonably happy with the FZ15 except for the image quality (I do lots of wildlife photos and heavily crop many of my pictures to get closeups).Well, the FZ28K is WONDERFUL.  The image quality is quite nice.  The zoom is better than advertised.  You can actually get a 32X zoom at 3Meg.  And the image still looks fine.  The color is MUCH better than the FZ15.  The anti-shake is MUCH better too.  The only negatives I've run across so far (after a few days) is the camera is almost too small, at least for my hands.  And the camera is light.  Again, almost too light.  The manual is TERRIBLE, much worse than the FZ15 manual which only had a little of the translation problems you often see with  Japanese gear.

Better reviews than the Canon and Nikon Cameras in the same range3. Easy to carry in spite of 18x optical zoom (I did not want SLR.. it is very inconvenient on Hikes. I have used one before)When i had my first photo session mainly indoor, i was really astonished to see the Intelligent Auto mode of Panasonic FZ28S. It is so powerful that you can actually focus on small objects and blur the rest of the background. It took really good indoor photos in low light. The IA mode selects the correct mode automatically and displays the focus. you can change the focus using AF lock features The portrait mode can even detect faces on the television screen.I am yet to explore other features and will post their reviews later.

Gave my wife a fuji digital camera a few years ago and were hooked. From close-ups of flowers to distant shots of national park scenic wonders, that little camera was awesome. But a couple of drops made it more and more difficult to use. My wife wanted just an updated version of that camera she had come to love. However, I did some consumer research and came upon this Panasonic Lumix and read the reviews. Thought I'd take a chance of upsetting my wife and replace her beloved camera with this product. She loves it (as do I)! It is so much more versatile and allows for more options than come with most slr's. If you just want to point and shoot, it takes great photos. If you want to venture out for more special effects or a particular lighting option, this one will do it. If you want to zoom in while shooting on video mode, this one will do it. The only criticism we have is that some of the controls seem to be too crowded. If it were me, I would have designed that a little differently, but that is a minor issue. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that we have only had it a few weeks and don't want to give a final judgment until we have put it through all the rigors. But from where we sit at this point, if you want versatility and want to lug around just one camera that can take tight wide angle shots, zoom in on wildlife and scenic wonders, experiment with some cool lighting, or just shoot a few seconds of quick video, so far, this camera does it all with pleasing results.", "Date": "November 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "B.

Definitely superior image quality to any compact or ultra-compact, and better than most super-zoom cameras, but obviously still not quite SLR quality.

It's a step up from that, but still far simpler than an SLR.  Anyone complaining about lousy indoor shots obviously hasn't tried using the very simple shutter-priority setting, that, or they haven't tried playing with ISO's.Noise is fine until ISO 800.  At 800 you can get away with it if you turn up the built-in Noise Reduction on the camera (which is surprisingly good).

It is easy to use and has excellent capabilities.  I did weeks of research before deciding on the FZ28.  One thing gave me pause: negative reviews concerning the Electronic View Finder.  Since I MUCH prefer using an EVF over the LCD display, I was fearful. I ordered one because there were very few other negative things said about this camera, and it is an excellent value.  My experience has been that the EVF is very usable.  It is bright and clear.  I wish it were bigger but I would still rate it as very good. I wear progressive bifocal glasses and have had no real issues using the EVF.  I was a bit taken aback by the plastic body construction. However, I think the camera is very study and I LOVE the weight.  This camera doesn't feel like a hunk of lead hanging from your neck.  Other positives are the use of SDHC memory (the 8gb Class 6 Transcend has been excellent), lightweight lithium battery that gives lots of shots (extras are easy to find and inexpensive -- I bought a very cheap one that works great), and quick accurate focusing (especially using the one area high speed option.)  The audio quality is not great, but is okay.  Mostly though, this thing is just plain fun to use. It takes great pictures but is not dauntingly complex.  Experimenting with different settings is easy to do. You can use the \"fancy\" settings or keep it simple with the iA button. Above all else, believe me, the ultra zoom function is a delight.  I use it constantly.  You can take closeups of flowers while standing up, or capture images of a skittish woodchuck from a comfortable distance (for both you and the woodchuck), and take well framed shots of people from a non threatening range.  The ability to reduce the megapixel setting to increase the zoom is very easy to access and works extremely well.  Being able to zoom while shooting video is essential and this camera does it smoothly.  Stabilization works well, but can not perform miracles (a handle screwed into the tripod tap gives me some added stability.)  I have enjoyed this camera immensely, but I HATE the fact that it has no remote shutter release mechanism.  This feature is simply essential for good tripod photography. Surely it can not be that expensive to incorporate into a design.  The self timer \"work around\" is a poor substitute for a feature that should be on every camera with a tripod receptacle. I have taken away one star for that glaring flaw.  But this is a great camera.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Affordability, flexibility and creativity. What's not to love?", "Author": "M.

True, I was just goofing off and those rolls sat in my closet for years until they were no longer able to be processed, but it sparked something in me.Years later, I would get my first digital camera: an Argus brand with a 2 megapixel limit. Then, a Canon Powershot A540 in 2006. I would steadily become more and more experienced, yet never quite \"serious\" enough to learn about things such as Aperture, ISO or even utility items like tripods.This all changed in late 2008. With quite a bit of discretionary funding set aside, my interest in photography turned into a full-blown passion as I browsed the Camera & Photo section Amazon. I came across the \"Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28K\". While I was biased towards Canon cameras, I had read that the Lumix series of Panasonic cameras were worth consideration.So, I purchased it in early January and didn't really get around to using it until February. I also purchased a polarizing filter to try out against sky-filled backgrounds, and both a monopod and tripod for stable shots.---After taking a couple hundred pictures with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28K, I can safely say this is one hell of a camera.Being what is known as a \"bridge\" camera, the FZ28K combines the ease of use present in a \"point and shoot\" camera with the manual control present in more expensive models. For this, I am thankful: I can turn the dial to the well designed IA (Intelligent Auto) mode which will, given the surrounding light and motion of the camera, choose the optimum settings to take pictures with.However, as I want to learn more, I can turn the dial further to access the Manual, Aperture or Exposure values and lower/raise them to my heart's content. In doing so, i've taken some good low light and night time pictures.There are some pre-set modes you can select such as \"Scenery\" or \"Portrait\" if you don't want to fiddle around with the controls. In particular, I have been greatly enjoying the \"Macro\" setting as it allows me to take some very crisp up close shots and the \"Landscape\" setting to take wider shots of outdoor areas.Along with the silver dial mode on top, the FZ28K has many standard options present in the current generation of cameras: black and white mode, histogram, color/light balance, and timer to name a few. Some have complained about the menus being hard to navigate, but after a few days worth of use, it becomes second nature.In terms of construction, I am highly impressed. The FZ28K is larger than a point and shoot, yet smaller than a DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex camera). It just feels sizable in my hands without being too heavy or bulky to carry while taking many pictures on the go in a short span of time.Included with the package is a battery (proprietary rechargable), battery charger, handy strap, lens cap, lens hood, audio/video cable, USB cable and software for editing pictures/creating panoramas. I suggest the \"Tamrac 5230 T30 Photo/Digital Camera Bag\" to carry the FZ28K in. Finally, get an LCD screen protector: the 2.7 inch wide screen on the back is surprisingly easy to bump into.Do I recommend this camera? Absolutely.

Since short video clips make a lot more sense (to me at least) instead of 60 minutes of a single event, this camera, along with a 16 GB Ultra II SD card, work really, really well for us.

Not because it's the best camera in the world, but because it does an excellent job of everything it aspires to do. I'll start off with some pros and cons.Pros:-Minimum focal length of 1mm; excellent for close-ups.-The telephoto is awesome, and in one contained lens.-Image stabilization works beautifully.-The HD video is of better quality than my dedicated HD camcorder.-The controls and menu are dense, but very intuitive. I found myself looking at the manual only for one or two trivial things. I had handled a Fujifilm camera before buying this one, and at the time I was thinking \"How am I going to get used to using this thing? The menu makes no sense.\" I was relieved that Panasonic did a much better job.-The LCD is something I consider to be ancillary and wasn't a factor in choosing this camera, but, for those who are interested, it is big, bright and seems to perform well outdoors.-I was afraid the joystick was going to be problematic for manual focus (as opposed to a focus ring, which this camera lacks), and that it would be difficult to use for fine adjustments, but that is not the case. It's very easy to use and the manual focus assist (enlarges a portion or all of the image to see detail) helps greatly.-Battery life is good. It's rated for 400 pictures, and I know I took about that many the first time I used it on one charge, with no shortage of playing with the LCD for reviewing images and checking out menu features.Cons:-I find that the autofocus doesn't want to focus on things within a couple inches of the lens, even when spot AF is enabled on the item. The same is true of telephoto macro shots where the camera is near its minimum focal distance for that zoom. For these shots, I use the manual focus. Personally this isn't a bother, but I list it under cons as it may be for some. Interestingly, my old Nikon 4100 did a better much job of autofocusing for macro shots.-As others have said, yes, the manual focus can be engaged accidentally, but personally I keep the display on and check my settings before taking a picture. I've done it and caught myself before it was a problem a couple times now.-The camera body does feel as though a fumble to the floor would do it no favors. But, it's light, and ergonomic.-The battery/card compartment is inaccessible when the camera is mounted on a tripod/tripod shoe.-The raw image format is RW2, which if I remember correctly is a proprietary format designed for Panasonic's supplied software. I haven't shot any raw yet, so I'm not sure if my version of Adobe Camera Raw will support RW2, but I know that earlier versions won't. I'd suggest researching to see what, if any, versions of Camera Raw support RW2 before buying if that's a deal breaker for you. I also have not installed Panasonic's supplied software (If I can't use Camera Raw, I'm not interested in the feature).Other things to note:-It actually took me a few days to figure out the quick menu. I'd been using the joystick for navigation, but I knew was also supposed to serve as a quick menu and I was confused because nothing happened when I pressed it. Well, for some reason it took me that long to try holding the button down. It takes about a second holding to activate the quick menu, probably to prevent accidental button presses when using the joystick.-So far I've found no use for the burst mode. My experience has been that if you want to catch a still of something happening quickly, the best way to do it is to record a video and then use the camera's review mode to snap a still from it. I have some shots of a 9mm casing ejecting from a semi-auto rifle that were done this way. The quality will never be great, but certainly it's enough to know what's going on.-The shutter lag and repeat between shots are things people have reviewed both positively and negatively, but I find them both to be as expected in sufficient light. I wouldn't categorize them as either pros or cons.-I never use the \"intelligent auto\" mode. Even for snapping pictures of family and friends. I prefer to use aperture priority mode with face detection if I want to snap a few casual images. I'm sure the IA mode has a use for some users, but my thinking is that for anyone vaguely camera-literate, its purpose is limited.Having written this it seems like I spent more time talking about what could be wrong with the camera than with what's right with it, but that's because I wanted to address the things that might concern people. Plus, it's easier to list the things that are wrong with the camera than the things that are right with it - that list would be too long. It's a safe bet that if I've omitted something in this review it's because it landed in the pro side and I felt it would be a given.To summarize, this is a great compact camera that gives the user significant control over his images. That being said, if you want the absolute best shots you can get in low light situations, a DSLR is the only way to go. Likewise, if you're a casual photographer and don't plan to use the manual settings, I would say there are other cameras that would be cheaper, more conveniently sized, perhaps easier to use and may even work better for what you want than this camera. But for people like me who want a significant amount of control over their images, and want to be able to photograph just about anything without carrying around a bag full of lenses and a bulky DSLR body, this is the camera for you.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Shopped hard and am very satisfied.", "Author": "A.J. \"Love to shoot\"", "ReviewID": "R3MX92LQ2FGPD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking to upgrade from a Nikon 5400 to something newer and better.

I just got back from a trip to south Florida, and spent a couple days in wildlife reserves.  I got some great bird shots with this camera.  I've also taken great general, non-zoom pictures.The pros:Excellent lens, great zoom range - 35mm equivalent 27-486mm.Switching to 3MP mode gives tighter magnification, to 32.1x.  It's not true optical zoom, though - it gives you the middle 3MP of the 10MP sensor.  Cropping, but not cropping.  This gave me great shots of farther-away birds that are good enough to post to the web, even to print out at smaller sizes, but of course at 3MP you can't blow them up.Intelligent auto mode and scene modes are easy to use.  This comes with the caveat that I had to learn through trial and error which modes to use in what situations.  Birds moving around a lot, sports mode.  Birds holding still, portrait mode.The cons:I only have one con:  If you want to focus manually, you do that using a tiny joystick on the back of the camera.  I've repeatedly overshot the focal point and had to go back and forth once or twice in order to get it.  The best way to use it is to use auto-focus to get you close, then switch to manual mode to fine-tune the focus.  I usually have to do that if I'm trying to photograph a bird in between tree branches.Conclusion:Overall, an excellent camera with great long zoom capability, and just about the best you can do without spending the money on a digital SLR.

Because after receiving the camera I used it for 2-3 days. Then I tried to upload photos but I couldn't coz amazon kept on giving the annoying error something like u can't upload photos before 24hrs of purchase... But now I think that was indeed useful because otherwise I could have missed a lot of features I discovered after using the camera over one month.I am not a pro photographer but I can consider myself as an experienced novice. My first digital camera was Sony cybershot (2MP) 11 yrs back. I used that for a long time. Then I used Canon (5MP or recent A-series), Nikon, Olympus. Recently I decided to buy a megazoom camera. I would be lying if I say that my first choice was Panasonic. I hardly knew about this `Lumix series'. So I restrained my search to Sony, Canon, Nikon and Fuji only. One day I was searching amazon for prices then suddenly this camera caught my attention. The first thing I noticed is the `Leica' lens. I saw many of my pro photographer friends are really crazy about Leica lens. Then I went through the reviews (that is very important) and finally I decided to take the risk (coz at that time also I was not sure about its performance).Now after using it regularly, I thought taking the risk was worth and the camera is worth the price. I am listing few features those impressed me most.1.The iA mode is superb, u can't make a mistake even if u wan't to.2.18x zoom is great. Even at full zoom, there is no distortion and focus remains accurate.3.It has a true manual mode. Unlike other cameras, here u can adjust all the settings in full throttle like ISO, Shutter speed, F-Stop.4.Unlike many other cameras, it has live Histogram function. U don't need to be a pro to understand it correctly. Just follow the rule (In general, the more pixels that are toward the right of the histogram, the  righter (or lighter) the photo will be. The corollary is that the more pixels there are toward the left of the  istogram, the darker the photo will be. There is no \"perfect\" histogram, because creative photographers take creative photos, which have all kinds of unlikely looking histograms.).  You can always check the histogram later but soon u will cherish the usefulness of getting it live.5.It has Leica lens. It produces some super colors and finest details.6.ISO ranges from 100 to 3200. Although it is always recommended to use lower ISO to minimize noise but hey, u may need it once suddenly.7.Shutter speed ranges from very fast to very slow (as slow as 60 sec). Although longer shutter speeds (1/60th or 1/30th) are more likely to be blurred than shorter shutter speeds (1/250th or 1/400th), but longer shutter speed is required in low light condition with lower ISO. I would recommend u to use a Tripod in that case (a basic tripod is less than $20).8.F-stop ranges from f/2.6 to f/8. Larger aperture numbered (f/8.0 or f/11.0) result in more depth-of-field than smaller aperture numbers (f/2.8 or f/4.0). The higher the f-stop number, the smaller the opening and greater the depth of field. So here, f/8.0=to maximize depth-of-field9.Here u have Aaperture priority mode and Shutter priority mode. These modes are automatic--meaning, for example, that the aperture priority mode automatically sets the shutter speed based upon the aperture setting -- you have to first select an appropriate aperture setting! The same thing applies to the shutter priority mode.You set the shutter speed to be what you want and then the camera sets the aperture to get the right exposure.10.There are lots of scene modes like party, fireworks, pets, baby (this particular has some cool features) and lots more. But I prefer Manual mode like for fireworks (f/8.0, ISO 100, Shutter speed 4-5sec). I have uploaded the firework pics and I am happy with the deliveries.11.There is also programmable custom modes where u can save any of urs favorite settings for future use.12.The video quality is great. It was my least expectation to get HD video from a still camera. Camera jurk is minimum with `Mode 2' stabilization. U can get great video even if holding it with hands. The good thing is that u can also use the optical zoom in videos. What else one can ask from a primarily still camera.There are also few down things like in iA mode it produces high sharpness after removing the noise which may be unacceptable to someone. During video recording, if u zoom in or zoom out too quickly, auto focus takes time that causes some blur in the video. Moreover u can't get RAW format in iA mode. In bright sunlight, the LCD as usual gets little dim (that's when the Histogram is useful). In low light in iA mode, some noise is visible without flash.Although there are few drawbacks but those are not at all serious compared to the great features it has. Performance is superb and value of price is also great.

It is loaded with tons of  fearutes of which I liked the most are iA mode, face detection, Ultrazoom lense (18x at 10MP and the lense power can be increased by adjusting to different picture resolutions *excellent feature*) and the video shooting mode.DMC-FZ28 is powered with the newly developed Venus Engine IV that supports a faster response time enabling the camera to shoot and reload quickly for the next shot. (Cannot expect the responsiveness of a DSLR though..)The Video capabilities are just amazing, accept for the length of the clip that restricts it to 2GB in HD mode. (that's acceptable for a P&S; camera).Another interesting feature in this camera is that you can zoom in and out while shooting a video clip.The still picture quality degrages at higher ISO settings but it still holds good amount details at reduced picture size.Panasonic has tried their best to pack as many fearures as possible for a P&S; into this model. But the camera lacks the outer feel. The buttons gets a cheap feel compared to the other competitors like Nikon P80, Sony H50 and the Canons.

It's a nice camera, smaller and lighter than my Sony, but loaded with features and options.In the past 6 years, I have owned 3 or 4 digital cameras. One or two years ago, I bought a Sony DHC-H5, primarily for its 12X zoom, which was a stunning improvement over the 10X I previously owned. I was one click away from buying the Sony DHC-H50 when I started reading rave reviews about the Panasonic Lumix FZ28. A bit of research convinced me to buy it from Amazon. In less than 24 hours, I returned it. (I admit I should have given it more time, but my basic disappointment would not have changed.)There is a gotcha in comparing zooms. A 12X is not necessarily 20% better than a 10X. The X factor is based on the unzoomed wide angle lens. The FZ28 has a much wider lens than the H5. On the plus side, the FZ28 will capture more of the scene before you because of that wide lens. However, that wide angle lens means 18X isn't as much of a zoom as one might think.To truly compare lenses, you must look at the 35mm equivalents for each lens. The 18X FZ28 zoom maxes to 486mm; the 15X H50 is 465mm. Both should reach farther than the 12X H5 at 432mm. But in careful testing, taking pictures from the same spot with the FZ28 and the H5, the zoom shots were virtually identical. (Actually, the H5's auto mode captured a brighter image than the FZ28, but the zooms were undistinguishable.) Because of the vagaries of the X factor, I didn't expect a huge improvement, but I still expected to be wowed and I was not. And by not being wowed, I was disappointed, even though this zoom will wow anyone who hasn't used another long zoom.I considered hanging on to the FZ28. It has many newer features lacking on my older H5, such as face detection and smile detection. Unfortunately, the LCD is smaller and less sharp than the H5.The tipping point was a rather minor feature, ironically. Most cameras record JPEGs, which is fine for most uses. A lot of high-end cameras shoot RAW format, which stores much more information than a JPEG. That info can be very useful in a powerful photo editor. Frankly, I crop and make minor tweaks that work fine in JPEG format. But, the fact that the FZ28 offers RAW + JPEG (one shot, two pix) tipped me towards the FZ28. And back again.You cannot shoot RAW if you use the fully automatic mode (Intelligent Assist). I can't understand why that is so, but it is true. So, if you want RAW, you forego auto and vice versa. Crazy. Unacceptable to me, as minor as my interest in RAW is.I'm not trying to steer anyone away from the FZ28 except for someone like me who is trying to pick between it and another camera and is swayed by the 18X zoom and RAW format. Make sure you have other reasons for buying the FZ28.peace,mjh", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money", "Author": "Paul Metz", "ReviewID": "R264I3C0BLSUY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've taken several pictures.

Until I recently decided to shoot in RAW because the photos were special and I wanted to have the flexibility that RAW editing allows. So I took a dozen photos in RAW that could not be re-taken.First, I had a problem installing the \"Silkypix\" RAW converter software that comes with the camera. But that was nothing compared to actually using the program. I am amazed that this issue has not come up in reviews, although you will find countless forum posts here and there about it.The software is made in Japan. The manual (digital form only) is incredibly difficult to comprehend (they needed to hire a native English speaker with  knowledge of image editing terminology to rewrite it). I read the words....and have no idea what they are telling me. The terms do not follow conventional language. I actually had to do a search of various webpages to find out how to save a file as a jpg (should have been a simple File:Save As, wouldn't you think? Nope, R-click on the image in the preview screen, drop down to \"development,\" and there you will find the Save As option! Not very intuitive). The RAW file format cannot presently be read by Adobe Camera Raw, or Gimp, or PhotoFiltre, or any other image editing program I could find.Therefore, if you do not plan on shooting in RAW, then I highly recommend the camera. If there is the remotest chance you will want to use that format, I suggest you look at other camera brands that allow RAW shooting in formats recognized by popular editing programs and bundled with conversion software that includes a well-written English manual.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "This camera is darn near perfect", "Author": "D.

My opinion is that it is hard to improve on this camera. In fact, if I had to sit down and design a camera for myself I doubt I could ask for anything more than what Panasonic has delivered.Sure, we all can wish for some little item here or there that would tickle our innards just a little more, but overall, this camera is darn near perfect.I researched all the reviews on it from Amazon and other well-respected photography sites and almost everyone has extremely high praise for it.

First of all its light, very light. No sore neck or shoulder from hauling around a doorstop all day.Want a wide focal range? Its here in spades with no extra lenses to schlep around.Want a camera that can be fully automatic for those occasions when you just don't have much time to be fiddling with dials and knobs? You got it.Want a camera that lets you be in total control of the exposure when you do want to fiddle with dials and knobs? You got it again.And the bottom line is always the results. So far the results are fantastic. Sharp focus, especially on photos of people thanks to face detection auto-focus. Great color rendition in JPG files. And of course, you can also shoot RAW images for the ultimate in creative adjustments in your digital darkroom.By the way, not many have commented on the software that comes with the camera, but that is another strong suit. The Silkpix program is great for adjusting RAW files and the Easy-PhotoPrint software handles the most common digital adjustments easily and quickly.I could go on for a good while longer, but I won't.

I never thought about cameras and Panasonic in the same category but I own two Panasonic DVD recorders and a Blu-Ray player and they are great. I am not going to bad mouth Canon as they are great cameras but I must say the Panasonic FZ28 really has impressed me. I like the looks, feel, weight and the well set up menus of this camera. I always thought Canon lenses were the best but this Leica lens is razor sharp and as good or better than Canon's same class cameras. The hi-def pictures and video are outstanding and I purchased the optional component cable to hook up to my Hi-Def TV and WOW what a picture and video. Everything good about this camera has been covered already in other reviews here so I will only say it's a ten star camera, five stars does not do it justice. Not everything is perfect for me. I wish I could \"assign\" video to the function button like I can with my Canon SD1000 and start shooting video instantly. It is somewhat inconvenient to turn the dial to video but not a big deal. The sound is OK on the video's but could be a little better. The joy stick controller is very easy to use and makes changing settings fast and easy.

I was not going to spend a lot of money though.  As much as I like the dSLR's, I couldn't justify for my uses, the cost.  I have been a Sony fan because of the shot to shot speed and response time, the same reason I didn't care for Canon's due to their slower response time.  I wasn't seeing a lot of great reviews for comparable Sony's however.  I found this Panasonic while researching and was skeptical to say the least.  I don't normally hear \"Panasonic\" in conversation about great cameras - tv's, stereos maybe, but not cameras.  The specs met my requirements - wider zoom, higher zoom, higher resolution, some manual control, rechargable batteries, and good flash.  But would the specs live up to expectations?  The reviews seemed to say so and I was willing to try it for the price.This camera has not disappointed me.  It is lighter than my old Sony and I don't have extra lenses to lug around.  The zoom, and the wide angle zoom, are both great!  At the highest zoom there can be some fringing but it's minor.  We have 5 dogs, a couple of which are camera shy.  I needed a higher zoom to sneak pictures of them, and of course that has worked.  I have been able to get pics of them on the boat as it's coming in without them noticing, out in the yard, etc.  Picture quality for me, both inside and outside, has been great.  3 of my dogs, and my indoor cat, are black - yet you can see individual hair detail in the pictures.  I will post some at some point.There are several choices of scene selections.  The menus and these selections took a little getting used to, but that's almost any camera when you change manufacturers.

Before buying I was looking at Fuji s8100fd, and then found at the review sites... about this category called superzoom/ultazoom. There are many models in superzoom, the ones that are popular are s8100fd, x10is, P90, 565uz, FZ28k. The dpreview group test helped me a lot, it was really extensive to go into the details specifications, review, samples of all the Super Zooms, then testing each of those extensively, then comparing them... what was left man... and then result was x10is and FZ28, making them tied at the top spot. And Cameralabs.com has done a decent job in putting the comparison at fair table. Very good reviews from that guy as well. The video review from camera labs, give you the practical display of both the cameras. Both Cannon x10is and Panasonic FZ-28 are good cameras, in the end it's up to the buyer to decide. It's only to the personal requirement (or rather liking) that he should choose between the two. Although price is always a big factor when buying something, I agree it is in this case as well. I have made my decision on FZ28k in the end, after a good thought. a continuation from the previous bestseller FZ18Reasons:-1. I needed a no fuss DSLR-like camera,2. Optical zoom is pretty good, 10MP is too much,3. I shall be shooting at 5MP at max, love the black colour over silver,4. O.I.S. (optical image stabilisation) of FZ28 is better than 565uz, S8100fd which use censor based,5. Very Imp - ability of FZ28 to optically zoom in video mode,6. HD Video in FZ28 over x10is (although it's a still camera, video is secondary),7. Better than Cannon x10is which uses AA batteries, FZ28 uses Li-ion .. lightweight battery. fantastic, you can buy 1more from at amazon for backup (must have IMO).8. 27mm of Panasonic Lumix lens is better than one on x10is9. 16:9 aspect .. thankyou! I dont want anymore squares.10. SDHC card option is good. Cheaper to replace,con:1. Mono Sound ( but i heard it can be improved using software or addon microphone)Recommended to buy with FZ28:-A. 4-GB/ 8-GB SDHC card with 10mb/s write speedB. A good camera case/bagc. Add-on battery - available just for 10$D. LCD Screen Sticker Guard.E. Power Adapter for continuous shooting indoors or direct Display of Playback at your HD LCD-TVF. Tripod Stand - for steady shots of Landscapes.Buy FZ28k if you want a decent replacement for DSLR (or the New when it comes), there is always a new thing coming but no doubt FZ28k is known as a bestseller from Panasonic-Lumix. Why spend 1000$ when you can get the same thing is 1/4th of that price. No need to buy 2 lens, Panasonic-Lumix is fantastic, this is my first panasonic and I can safely say that hey..people look beyond Cannon and Nikon. Panasonic Digital Cameras are awesome. If you want a compact Point & Shoot camera buy Panasonic TZ7 ! again a new model of bestseller TZ3/TZ5.Seller: VANNS @ 268.8$ free shipping (May 2009),Very good seller, prompt reply to email and shipped through Fed-Ex. I say if you getting a good deal choose these people. They are good at customer service. That's what a buyer needs.To Panasonic:a. Supply power cable add charging support, and may be 1200mAh battery.b. In next model you should add Dual Channel Sound, AVI MP4 recording. (Must Have)c. Adding a nice bag will be a big plus. In fact a must have IMO. FZ28 -> Excellent superzoom, highly recommended in SLR-like range of cameras.Keep Clicking...!! :) Regards", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great alternative to the Canon SX10IS", "Author": "Samuel Yu \"Reading is fundamental.\"", "ReviewID": "R2ER68FQBF3PAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a Canon loyalist for a very long time. My Canon Powershot S2 finally died on me a few months ago, and it was time to find a replacement. I was leaning heavily towards the newest version of the S2, the SX10IS - 20x optical zoom! However, at the time I was ready to purchase, it was out of stock at most places, and it was going for close to $400, which was more than I wanted to spend. After doing some more research on the internetz, I came across the Panasonic FZ28. The more I read about it, the more I was impressed. 18x optical zoom, HD video, burst mode, not too heavy or large in size, which was a big one for me. Being the father of young kids, I don't want to have to lug around a full-size dSLR with me. This type of \"bridge\" camera is perfect for my day to day use. Plus, at $250, the price was a lot less than the SX10IS, making it much more attractive as well. I've now had it for close to a month now, and will list the things that I like and don't like about this camera -Likes:1. Lightweight - the Canon S series cameras are heavy due to the fact that the use 4 AA batteries. My wife, who has been using the FZ28 a lot, loves how light it is.2. Battery life - even though it is a proprietary battery, it lasts a very long time between charges. The on-screen battery life indicator is pretty accurate as well.3. HD Video - I love HD video! Yes, it does use up a lot of memory, but the quality is pretty stunning. 720p at 30 frames per second is very nice. Just make sure your computer is able to handle playing it back. The Canon SX10IS only has VGA video.4. Picture quality - no complaints here. Photos are sharp and colors are good.Dislikes:1. No swivel out screen - this is one thing I miss from the Canon S series days, the nice swivel out screen. While I haven't found myself in situations where I would need it yet, I am sure it will happen someday. Still, it's not necessarily a dealbreaker2. No dedicated video record button - this is something the Canon S series also had. A button that was dedicated to use for 1 push video recording. On the FZ28, you have to set the dial to video, and then click the shutter button to start recording.3. Mono video recording - I do miss the stereo sound recording ability from the Canon. Some reviews I've read have a major problem with the sound quality of video on the FZ28. Sound is clear and audible to me, just mono. :(Hope this helps make someone's decision a bit easier. There is no perfect camera (yet), but this one has done a good job filling in for now, until that perfect one decides to arrive sometime in the near future!", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "James E.

After looking at various entries from Canon and Nikon, I selected the Lumix FZ28K.The zoom (18x) is great for candids when you don't want to be in someone's face and the image stability is really remarkable for keeping the image sharp in those situations. Color rendition appears to be very accurate and the flash is adequate in most situations up to about 20 feet. I am not a professional by any means, but have been able to obtain some great shots in the few weeks that I have been using the Lumix.The only drawback I have seen with the Lumix has been with the video aspects. I understand that this was never designed to be a video camera, but periodically one needs to shoot a little video. The HD video quality is excellent, but the sound quality is less than what I was getting from my Casio point and shoot. The .MOV format is not PC friendly (one must convert it to an .AVI to do any editing if you do not have a MAC to work up the files, and the 8+ minute time limit on HD recording can be problematic if you do not keep an eye on it. However, if you are shooting straight video and sound quality is not a major consideration, the video quality is the best I've ever seen from a \"still\" camera.The ability to get the depth of field and detail from a lightweight camera without all of the paraphenalia associated with an SLR was important in my selection of a replacement camera.

I can tell you, there is a difference between the two, for example the solid quality of the photos and the number of features/options, but this is as close to a DSLR you can get without actually spending the hundreds of extra dollars.I'm too lazy to go into more detail than that, but rest assured that this is a very good camera.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for sports photos", "Author": "Teresa A.

Without me even trying, it gave me a great shot of a hummingbird in flight! I love that you can adjust settings as much or as little as you want, depending on your level of expertise.

Yes, this little camera was much better in the sharpness category.The only downside was my DSLR was MUCH faster on the focusing and grabbing those quick images.

I just received my new FZ28 last night, so this is only a preliminary review.  The FZ28 is a much-mproved version of the FZ8.  One of the things they improved is the speed of image download to the computer.  On the FZ8 they claimed USB2, and technically they were correct, but the actual speed was more like USB1.  On the FZ28 it really is USB2.  There are also more burst-mode options, including some that are machine-gun fast if you are willing to accept 3 mb photos (which are fine for most ordinary purposes).  The lens offers a much more useful wide-angle of 27mm (35mm equiv.) versus the FZ8's 36mm.  Viewing photos is more convenient now, with a dedicated switch within easy reach.  A first look at the high-ISO side shows better color and less noise than with the FZ8, though the FZ8 wasn't bad in that respect.  They've kept the camera light in weight and it has the same efficient battery system.

It records at 30fps 720p which basically means if you want to do a lot of recording you're going to need a memory card. The internal memory for the camera is weak for videos and really doesn't hold many pictures so definitely look into a memory card.Overall, the Lumix is very versatile in allowing users to customize settings, provides crisp clear pictures, and has easy to use functions.

What I have been looking for is a camera is easy to handle and that can take good pictures in low light without a flash.  You might say that I am the un-offical photographer for a local high school choir and drama department, since my spouse is the teacher.  The low light and the dance moves associated with stage productions are really challenging to photograph. I just don't like the size of the DSLR and changing lenses about the stage without disturbing the audience too much.  I have found the this DMC-FZ28K fits the bill.  I am very happy with the camera features, value ($299) and the results.  I especially like the intelligent ISO mode and the big zoom (I can really fill the frame with close ups). It works for me.  All I need is dark clothes, a tripod, the FZ28K, and a gentle touch. The students love the pictures and they have been very helpful to teach the student the visual aspects of their performances.

I bought it with the Sandisk Ultra III 8GB SDHC card, as by default you cannot take Videos longer that 2GB's in size, and if i wanted to do video I'd buy a Camcorder. This time around I opted for a proprietary battery pack as opposed to the rechargeable AA variety. the reason for this i will say is that the regular NiMh rechargables cannot deliver the current required to recharge the flash, so there is a dreadful pause between shooting. but the down side of proprietary packs are that you need the special charger, and of course you can only use the batteries which are intended for the purpose, for this reason I got an extra battery.

In reading what follows please keep in mind that I am only an amateur so I won't go into any technical details. Here are a few thoughts about my experience with this camera:- First and foremost, if used well, this camera takes amazing pictures. I am particularly impressed by the quality of pictures taken at night or with indoor lighting. With a tripod, and using 100ISO and 1-2sec exposure you can take really amazing pictures.- The price is amazing, given the quality of the pictures.- The lens is very eclectic, going from very wide angle (for landscapes) to a powerfult zoom (but see below). About the zoom, do note that in certain settings you can achieve 32x magnification (not just 18x).- I really like the cap, which is securely tied to the camera by a string. I do not agree with the reviewer that writes that it falls off easily. It never fell off my camera in more than a year, although it did partly break recently (but because of my fault).- I also LOVE the fact that it takes filters. This was very important for me, because I think polarizer filters can improve outdoor photography a lot.- The provided software is good and functional.- I find battery life satisfactory. I rarely take more than 40-50 pictures in a day, but I never had problems with the battery and anyway I usually have a spare with me. Also, the battery recharges quite quickly (one-two hours).- Movies are of very high quality, altough I have not explored this much.- The manual is quite clear and without being a genius, but with a bit of skill, you can actually navigate the built-in menu quite easily without using the manual.- I found customer service fantastic. At some point (see below) the camera was damaged and I got a refurbished replacement at no cost which is now working perfectly. Thanks Panasonic!My two reasons for not being totally happy so far?1- the reason why the camera had to be replaced was that at some point a bit of of water fell on it. Not much water at all, really, but after a few minutes of increasingly erratic behavior the camera totally died. So, don't expect super-sturdy construction and do be careful when you handle the camera in wet conditions. On the other hand, like I said, the customer service was fantastic.2- if you are naively thinking of buying this camera (also) for wildlife photography, you will likely be disappointed. The zoom, although powerful, if not good enough for that. What I mean is, for instance, that I see much more clearly birds with an 8x42 binocular than with this camera with maximum magnification (that is, 32x, which you can achieve in some settings). If your subject is more than 15-20 yards away the level of detail you can achieve is rather disappointing. As far as I can see, for wildlife photography you really need to spend significantly larger amounts of money, too bad!!! On the other hand, the zoom is often good enough that you can use your pictures to help in identifying a bird on your field guide.Anyway, to sum it up, after one year I can say that I recommend this camera highly and I would certainly buy it again.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Price Has Gone Way Up On These", "Author": "Confederate", "ReviewID": "R2TF4LBIHKDZ2E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Lumix has always put out a very nice line of cameras, and the DMC-FZ28 is no exception. The camera takes exceptional photos, is robust and now, as many things are these days, a little out of date. The stabilization works well, there are many modes, sound is good, but video is limited (mostly due to its age). For five hundred dollars, one would now expect there to be a HD video, but there is none. The photos also show a bit of distortion at wide angles, again, nothing unusual, but many of Lumix's newer cameras are smaller and do just as well.The camera's flash is very good, as is its powerful zoom ratio, which alone probably accounts for its high price.

I also enjoy the intelligent setting and anti-shake features.From the time I opened the box I have been relatively unhappy with this camera's performance.  It's low light and flash performance are very weak, very grainy and out of focus at times (even when the camera says it is in focus).  It has trouble in the long lens mode where it has difficulty finding the subject and focusing.  There is no consistent performance in the area of sharpness, having to photoshop many images. For a 10MB camera these performance issues are unacceptable.What do I like? The playback feature is good quality and easy to use.  The camera is light to carry and the batteries work up to specs. The Leica lens is high quality.I would not purchase this camera again if I knew of these problems beforehand and I would not recommend this camera as it's overall performance is inferior.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beyond expectations", "Author": "Thomas H.

I have had it for two years, and am a advanced amateur/semi pro photographer, so I take a lot of photos, and I have found this camera to be nearly flawless in most situations. Its biggest pros are it is very light, especially when compared to a DSLR, it takes fantastic photos in all but the most challenging conditions, and it has full manual controls, including manual focus, which few if any other non-DSLR's have. The Image Stabilization is also very good, a virtual must have if you are serious about taking good pictures in a wide range of conditions. The zoom does not actually magnify it 18x, more like 10 or 12 at the most, but that is the same for all cameras I've used,and 10 or 12 is fine for most situations.Its only cons are it has a fairly small sensor, so it sometimes struggles with photo graininess in low light, and it can be a little slow in focusing and in the time from when you press the shutter button to when it actually takes the photo when compared to the higher-end SLR cameras, but there are very few superzooms or point-and-shoots that do not suffer from these problems, and those few that don't cost two to three times as much as this one, and do not have all of the other features that this camera can boast either.To sum it all up, I would highly recommend it to any amateur, or really anyone who wants a light, portable, high quality camera at a reasonable price, but who doesn't want to sacrifice features to get it.

This drives me crazy because there is not other way to adjust the manual settings except with this joystick. This means until we have it fixed we will not be able to use manual mode settings.

I have been using it since Dec. of 2008.  It was a bit difficult to learn at first due to all the different settings available and my not being a professional. However, I was very much drawn to it due to the wonderful zoom capabilities.  I was used to a 10X Zoom with my Olympus C-740 and Zoom was important as I did not want to get into changing lenses quite yet.  Once I got used to it's features I was able to take some very nice photos and the videos were good with the FZ28 and if I wanted I could change lenses...I never did buy other lenses.  I was pretty happy with what I was getting.  Then disaster struck.  Unfortunately, the on and off button quit working a few days ago (just slides back and forth and nothing happens) and I was left with a decision on what to do. Repairing it was quite expensive compared to buying another similar camera.  I did a little research and found that Panasonic has a newer model for a reasonable price on Amazon, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35 (18X Zoom).  After comparing it with the comprable Nikon Coolpix P100 (26X Optical Zoom) and the Canon SX20IS (20X Optical)...I began to think it was the Nikon I wanted instead because it had the higher Zoom...however, after finding out that you cannot charge the battery outside of the camera for the Nikon and the Canon uses AA batteries instead of the battery packs the Panasonic uses I realized that I would be happier with the Panasonic FZ35 afterall and for some other reasons as well...so, I just ordered it and am awaiting it's arrival.  Another feature I like with Panasonic is that you can copy, move, etc. photos between the camera and your computer with no additional software needed on my PC besides explorer and windows XP. Evidently this is not the case with some cameras.  Also, a bit of a hassle I found out, I understand the FZ35 manual is on pdf rather than paper...although an inconvenience, I can live with it.

I have taken great pictures of fireworks and gotten close-ups of lectures and grandsons on a school stage all without using any other special settings. As for the auto focus, it has a fine point, so that, for example when I have taken pictures of cherry blossoms, pointing at the blossoms, have a good close-up and then move the auto focus point a bit to the Jefferson Memorial and gotten a good picture of it with the cherry blossoms still in the picture. The auto stabilization works fine, especially when pulling out the camera fast for a quick picture. The zoom brings most objects in for suitable viewing, even from several hundred feet away.The battery does seem to run out sooner than I expected, but then that is also because I am constantly using the zoom feature. I simply bought another battery and have it charged at the ready. The camera will tell you when the battery power is running low.My only complaint has been I have lost two lenses because they don't seem to fit tightly on the threads enough to stay there.

I bought the FZ28 because of reasonable photo quality and, unlike the ultra compacts, I can actually hold and use it without tripping buttons I don't intend to. Understand that the sensor is teeny-tiny. The physics of the situation guarantee problems with noise, and that any attemps at noise reduction will smear detail.Use the viewfinder to frame and trust the autofocus. This finder was never meant for fine focus and any composition but framing. When I need to hold the camera steady, I use the finder, instead of the screen.I actually find that, even shooting JPG's, the overexposure warning is a bit hysterical. Opening them in Photoshop, I find there's some headroom left. The colors are not the over-satuated kandy kolors of some compacts; they're natural.I do agree that noise reduction takes too heavy a toll on image sharpness. I found the noise excessive at ISO 400;ISO 100 makes a world of difference. My advice? Shoot at 100 whenever possible and shoot RAW if you have the gut feeling the image is worth the work. Turn the Noise Reduction down as far as it will go.  Deal with the noise in your RAW processor. You will see color fringing in your RAW images, because the JPG in-camera processor isn't there to deal with it. My CS2 deals with it easily.I don't like the supplied software; very unintuitive. If using SilkyPix (and if you dislike it as much as I do), I save the RAWs as 16-bit TIF's and work them in Photoshop, OR save your Panasonic RAWs in a file. Download Adobe's DNG Coverter for free. Identify the files in which you have your RAWs and in which you want them saved. Hit \"Convert\" and all your Panasonic RAWs will be DNG's. Work the DNG's in any editing software you wish.

The picture quality and colors are excellent.  The long zoom allows me to take nice close-up pictures from the stands at baseball and football games.  The Burst Mode is great for capturing multiple action photos and makes it possible to review pitching mechanics or capture great shots of the bat making contact with the ball.  The battery lasts long enough to take 100's of photos during a double header or a full football game.The camera has plenty of automatic settings that make it easy for an amateur to use, but it becomes a bit more complex if you want to take advantage of all the features.  I consider myself pretty advanced when it comes to figuring out technical products, but I still haven't used more than half of the features available on the camera.

This camera is remarkably good, even in the fully automatic settings, at taking excellent pictures in a very broad range of lighting conditions.I bought several high speed memory cards for it, but one brand (I'd rather not state its name) did not work & could not be made to work. My slow cheap ones did work. The Panasonic 8 & 16 GB cards work beautifully & hold enormous numbers of pixplus movies (the latter soak up much memory & battery power, so have spares of both for long trips).

It's not likely to get lost as this is slightly smaller and lighter than the old school 35MM SLR's.  I like the grip.  The only gripe I have is when taking indoor flash shots of people, you need to go to portrait mode and pre-select the type (indoor, outdoor, e.t.c.) using the joystick (it's easy if you read the manual and play around with it a few times to get used to it), as shooting in the easy mode results in blurred subjects.  While this is no problem for me, it may take some first-time users a while to get used to all of the functions.  A big plus was the switchable viewfinder, and the easy short-cut buttons on the top for auto focus function and macro.  The battery life was good (400+ photos), and the night time exposure settings really show how sensitive this camera is.  I found the color a good flat, balanced, and consistant tone.

I personally give this camera 5 stars. This is merely a sampling of the high-def video. The still shots and intelligent auto on this camera are amazing and I've taken several thousand pictures with this camera already.If you're in the market for a great CONSUMER-level camera, then this is definitely a choice you should consider. If you're a professional you're probably not even looking at this camera. Keep in mind that the \"lens selection\" for this camera is consumer grade. If you are thinking of getting extra lenses and stuff like that, then you need a higher grade camera.

Formanek \"Arizona Jim\"", "ReviewID": "RM0FN7MKP4VCX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I currently own 2 Panasonic cameras, an older FZ5 and this recently purchased FZ28.I have been extremely happy with the FZ5. I can't say enough good things about it. But when I saw an FZ28 that offered a manual focus and a larger LCD panel for less than what I payed for my trusty FZ5, I bought. I have already returned it to Panasonic because pictures that were focused routinely with the FZ5 were anywhere from poor to totally unusable. Panasonic promptly replaced my \"new\" FZ28 with a \"refurbished \" unit. I don't feel comfortable with that tradeoff and the refurbished unit has the same lack of sharpness in pictures as the new one. The problem seems most pronounced in medium to long zoom shots. With the FZ5 I could count the whiskers on my cats face across the yard. With the FZ28, I am not sure he has whiskers. Functionally, I dislike the position of the review button. I find my thumb bumps it too easily in to the review position . And the lens hood is the most Rube Goldberg device I have encountered on any camera. On the FZ5 it just twisted on to the lens, bayonet style. On the FZ28 a screw on adapter ring is required and the lens hood the clamps to the adapter ring by turning a small thumb screw on the side of the hood. I gave the camera 2 stars because the macro works fairly well and I like the larger LCD. But I would say that only about 40% of the pictures I take are acceptable keepers compared to  a 90% or better success rate with the old FZ5. Unfortunately, it is too late to return the FZ28 but I know which camera is going along on my upcoming vacation. My trusty FZ5!

It's got image stabilization and all the features you expect from a modern digital camera. You feel like you're using one of those pricier DSLRs, but it's sold at the price point of a P&S.;PROSGreat quality lens and pictures. Focus is sharp, colors are realistic, and the flash is more powerful than what you get on more compact point-and-shoots. Good build quality, feels sturdy but not too heavy; comes with a nice locking lens cap that doesn't come off accidentally. Good battery life.CONSThe Lumix FZ28 is kind of big for a point-and-shoot, and if I'm going to lug around something like that, I want a real DSLR. The screen is not as large or as nice as those on some of the other newer cameras.

A challenge for most cameras.The first thing I noticed was that the LUMIX logo on the front of the camera is metallic. When taking low light photos under a soft spot, I observed that this meant that the text was reflecting back onto my subject! Doh! A piece of tissue stuffed over the logo helped, but it's not a long term fix; you'll have to paint over that metallic text.The zoom is useless, especially for macro work. Forget it. It just blurs the image. Likewise for all other conditions; it works fine for about 3/4 of its range, and at the maximum zoom, it loses all ability to focus, even in optimal conditions. That's just silly. On the positive side, you *can* take some nice near macro shots. I got some very nice bee butts, but I did have to practically jam the camera right up against them to get the pictures. Brave me.White balance under fluorescent light becomes a distinctly green balance. Maybe I just didn't find the right adjustment, but in that case, it should have been easier to find.The camera ships with a lens hood and a camera bag, but the hood doesn't fit in the bag; you have to carry it separately. What the...?The documentation is, well, Japanese. Not well written or organized, and too sketchy; chances are your questions aren't answered in the doc. There's enough there to get you started, but in general, count on figuring out the camera on your own.On the positive side, the glass is beautiful, the display nice and bright (and big), and the user interface, once you get the hang of it, is fairly intuitive. One annoying feature of the glass, though, is that if there's some schmutz on the lens, the display won't show it (unless it's a thumb or a lens cap). You'll find it on your photos afterward. So check your lens and clean it often.It's also fairly light and easy to handle. I can't seem to be able to pick it up without putting a big ol' fat fingerprint on the display, but that may be because I'm a leftie, and this camera (like all cameras I've ever found) is definitely designed for right handers.Image quality; reasonably crisp. Even with adjustments, I find the color to be a little off, but then, I'm the pickiest of the ultra-pickiest when it comes to color matching.I got this camera because of a problem with the camera I'd planned to use for shooting stills of a play (yes, I was hired to do this), and this was the best I could grab on the way to the job. Lumix has a good reputation for low light. Unfortunately, the lighting board at the theater blew out just before the performance, (it was a jinxed evening all the way around!) so the play was performed under (you guessed it) fluorescent house lights. Hello, Photoshop! (It was that or force the production to tell people that the play was about Orion slave girls or leprechauns. Everybody and everything looked green.)Oh, btw, I took some flash photos of the actors before the performance. No red eye, but I did have to Photoshop out some bright orange reflections in the glasses one of the actors was wearing, and rebuild her eye. (There was nothing behind us that would have produced that orange light, so I'm assuming, perhaps unfairly, that it was some flash artifact of the camera.)This camera may perform far more admirably for more normal photographers than I! If you're considering this (or any)camera, pick it up from a source that has a generous return policy (like Costco), and try it out first, see if it suits you. In these tough financial times, this is a stiff investment for many; halfway between a point and shoot and a real DSLR, so if you have the resources for a camera, be fussy and make sure you get one you absolutely love, even if you have to pay more (or less).

Taking closeups of flowers using the special \"flower\" mode appeared straightforward, but reviewing on the computer showed that in 9 out of 10 shots the camera had focused on something else than it appeared when I took the shot.  Saving a single JPG to the card took longer than 2 seconds, I mean, it's an inexpensive camera but still.Overall, I wish the camera had performed the way others rave about it. The literally 3 or 4 great shots I got out of it are definitely very nice given the price point (I even got a shot of a helicopter in flight at full zoom that compares quite favorably to a similar shot I took with a $1,500 Canon 100-400mm zoom lens), but to get only so few percentage wise is just not worth the frustration and time spent. I have other P/S Panasonics and they perform great. I also have a Canon 40D and have been a photographer for many years.
