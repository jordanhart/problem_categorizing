Angle Dual Image Stabilized Optical Zoom as a very compact camera that packs a lot of advanced features into a \"Point & Shoot\" format camera body. The F70EXR is somewhat less expensive than the F200EXR, having a slightly lower resolution (10MP vs 12MP), a smaller LCD (2.7\" vs 3\"), and a few less shooting mode options. That being said, the F70EXR also has several improvements over the F200EXR, including double the optical Zoom (10x vs 5x), an improved Auto ERX mode and two new shooting modes (see below), and the ability to zoom while shooting video.This is somewhat of a lengthy review, so I will summarize my findings here:The F70EXR is a very powerful and feature rich \"Point & Shoot\" style camera that can be made to perform well for almost any application. The Auto Modes are very accurate and will almost always produce a good picture. In the manual Modes the user has more control over the settings, but the results are almost always impressive. This camera has a lot of advanced features and often takes better pictures than our much more expensive dSLR camera. The only weak area is in the Movie Mode, which is only VGA quality but does at least allow for zooming while filming (see video and review below).Now for my overview and full review:The F70EXR has many advanced features, including -* 10 Megapixel Super CCD EXR Sensor* 2.7\" LCD Screen* Wide Angle (27 mm) through 10x Optical Zoom (270 mm)* Image Stabilization* Wide Range of Preconfigured Modes (see below)* Face Recognition with automatic in camera Red Eye Removal* Support for SD and SDHC cards* Includes 47 meg of internal memory, which is about 30 pictures in the highest resolution mode* Long lasting Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery (NP-50)What's in the Box -* F70EXR Camera* Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery (initial charge took just under 2 hours)* Home Battery Charger* Wrist Strap* Proprietary USB Cable* Video Cable (standard video/audio only)* Printed Basic Manual Booklet (in several languages)* CD with Owner's  Manual (Full) in PDF* CD with FinePixViewer Software (not bad image management, basic editing, and linking to Fuji web content)* Plastic Sleeve for Battery Storage* Miscellaneous Warrantee and Warning PagesThe Controls on the small camera body are generally well placed and easy to use, with a \"rose\" type interface for selecting and navigating the many menu options, selecting Flash, Macro, Self Timer, Delete, and Exposure Compensation settings. In addition to the Power Button, there are also four small buttons for selecting Play Back, Photo Mode (F), Face Recognition and Red Eye Removal, and Display.The Photo Mode (F)  sets several options that will affect your pictures, like ISO, Image Size, Image Quality (jpeg compression, I turned mine from the default \"Normal\" to \"Fine\") , and Film Simulation.The numerous shooting modes are accessed through the Dial and include:* \"Auto\" (Red Camera Icon) mode allows the F70EXR to be used as a \"Point & Shoot\" and usually produces truly outstanding quality pictures* EXR Mode (EXR Icon, White Letters with Red Background)  - HR Mode (Resolution Priority), produces very crisp detail of intricate subjects and is useful in product photography - The Camera will display HR when in this mode.  - SN Mode (High Sensitivity & Low Noise), produces low-light shots with minimal noise - The Camera will display SN when in this mode.  - DR Mode (D-Range Priority), takes two pictures and merges them in-camera to provide great detail in highlights and low lights. - The camera will display DR when in this mode.* Auto EXR Mode, tries to select between several presets (many found in the SP Mode, see below). This is a big improvement over the same mode on the F200EXR and is a good default for the camera. You can still use the regular \"Auto\" mode or manually set the SP mode when you have time to set up the camera.* Program (P) and Manual (M) modes are standard modes enabling the user to set Shutter/Aperture priority or to take full control of settings, respectively* Natural (N) is an interesting option for capturing images with the natural scene lighting* Natural + Flash (N+ Lightning Bolt Icon) option takes two pictures, one as the \"Natural\" mode and another with the flash, to ensure a good picture is captured.* Movie Mode (Movie Camera Icon) is a really useful video (with audio) clip capture mode that allows for 320 or 640 resolution at 30 Frames/Second. The clips are saved in standard AVI format and are decent enough for YouTube. Fuji listened to the consumers so now you can use Zoom while filming, but it does re-auto focus and the motor sound is picked up when changing.* Scene Position (SP) Mode allows you to select between 15 presets, including:  - Pro Focus, Pro Low-Light, Portrait, Portrait Enhancer, Landscape, Sport, Night, Night (Tripod), Fireworks, Sunset, Snow, Beach, Party, Flower, and Text  - The Pro Focus and Pro Low-Light Modes are new features that allows for soft background portraits and low noise, high detail pictures in low light, respectively. While these will work free hand, I recommend using a tripod and turning off Image Stabilization since the camera take multiple pictures and combines them in camera to make these effects.There are far too many options and combinations to cover much more deeply, so I'll wrap this up with my major likes and dislikes:Likes -+ Great Point & Shoot \"Auto\" Mode takes impressive 10 MP pictures+ Very low \"Shutter Lag\", even when not pre-focused+ Impressive Wide Angle and 10x Optical Zoom Lens, but controls can be a little \"spongy\"+ Clear description of Shooting Modes displayed on LCD when changing dial settings+ Fantastic EXR Modes allow for capturing outstanding pictures that would have been unusable with lesser cameras+ Outstanding \"Super Intelligent Flash\" produces great illuminated scenes without washing out the subject, a feature that is very useful in Macro Mode which we use heavily for our business product photography needs+ Accurate Face Recognition with automatic in-camera Red Eye Reduction - This feature assures people are in focus, helps with in-camera Slide Show playback, and can automatically remove Red Eye. It is also very cool to watch it work!+ Ability to Zoom while filming in Movie Mode, but motor noise can be heard on video+ Large ISO range of 100 to 12800 - I manually limit mine to 800 or lower most of the time+ Lots of user selectable options - Spending a little time reading the Owner's Manual is a good investment to learn about all of the features packed into this camera.Dislikes -- Steep Learning Curve (reading the Owner's Manual is absolutely required to take full advantage of all the features this camera offers)- No Remote Control - this is important to us since we take product pictures, our workaround is to use the Self Timer- Movie Mode Zoom - a nice feature but the camera can be slow to refocus and the motor noise is recorded- No HD video - not too important for me since we have HD camcordersLike the more expensive F200EXR, this is a very powerful camera that can be made to outperform almost any other consumer grade camera currently on the market if you spend a little time reading the Owner's Manual and do a little experimenting with the extensive options. We have been able to take absolutely beautiful pictures in the standard \"Auto\" mode and have produced some photos that we would not have been able capture, because of tricky lighting, by using the EXR modes.The F70EXR is \"Highly Recommended\"! This is an easy choice for those in need of the advanced features and functionality this camera delivers in a very compact Point & Shoot form factor, 5 out of 5 Stars!", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Extremely usable camera, however be aware of the limitations", "Author": "GM", "ReviewID": "R3P30DFT32N48G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a small well built camera, all metal including the tripod mount. Overall pictures are nice but a little on the cool side when put in Auto White balance. I will upload samples on this (compared to canon which is a little on the warmer side on Auto). Auto mode is probably fine for bright outdoors.The EXR mode which is advertised the most has 4 sub-modes. EXR Auto, EXR High ISO Low Noise (S/N), EXR High Dynamic Range (D/N) and High Resolution (H/R). I haven't yet figured out the difference between EXR H/R and  normal large size Auto. Try to avoid the EXR Auto mode since you cannot limit the max ISO.The firmware can definitely use some updates. It tends to pick too high an ISO in all Auto modes.  On some modes you can control how high it will go. Try to set it at Auto(400) wherever possible. In full EXR Auto I have a number of shots full wide angle at 1/80 and ISO 800 where 1/40 and ISO 400 (or even 1/20 ISO 200) would have been fine. The direct SUNLIGHT white balance is for some reason called FINE white balance. The Manual seems to talk about a \"if AUTO Image size is selected\" (page 34 of the full PDF), but there is no AUTO image size option. You select the image size you want, the camera overrides it as needed.  The EXR D/N mode is the most useful of all EXR modes since it gives a 800% Dynamic range boost and you can limit the max ISO.There is also a Pro Light Mode which does a hash of 4 pictures and it seems to do a better job at reducing noise then EXR S/N. Considering that it takes 4 frames, you need a Tripod and a still subject (if you have a Tripod and still subject why do you need pro-light?). It is limited in use in scenarios where you really need to use this -  dark days, shady areas or indoors - because it will pick ISO 1600.The ISO 1600 which all Auto mode prefers by default should be avoided. The camera also has perfectly unusable ISO 3200, 6400 and 12800. The reason for the existence of these speeds escapes me. An analog TV tuning to a non-existing station would have less noise. Fuji should really limit the max ISO to 800.I have a old Canon A610 (5MP with a larger sensor 1/1.8, Fuji has 1/2). The Fuji is better in many ways; its smaller, compact, more zoom.  But purely from an image quality point of view, there is not much observed difference.  There is no quality difference between this 5 year old Canon and the Fuji EXR S/N Mode at upto 400 ISO (The Fuji EXR SN mode results in 5MP) at comparable focal lengths. The ISO 800 in Fuji is actually usable which is unusual for p&s.;  Chromatic Aberrations are more visible in Fuji than in Canon at comparable focal lengths. Either the Canon lens is better or its firmware is removing this.While I do not have a modern p&s; to compare the image quality (e.g. all the newer Canons use a much smaller 1/2.3 sensor), the addition of all the new technologies is not necessarily able to overcome the sensor size reduction.PROS:1. All metal well built2. Extremely usable zoom range3. Very useful EXR D/N range4. Very usable Auto mode if you limit the ISO to 400.CONS:1. Fuji - Please remove ISO 1600 and higher, reprogram the firmware to select smallest usable ISO  in the Auto modes.2. Like lots of newer p&s;, there is only 1 aperture size + a simulated aperture using neutral density filter. So much for changing depth of field.3. Some learning needed with all the modes,scenes and film options.4. Lens chromatic aberrations are visible, this can be removed in software.OVERALL:Extremely usable camera, however be aware of the limitation. Try to work around Auto modes to select small ISO if needed, use custom white balance for really critical shots.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Somewhat Disappointing", "Author": "Virginia Reader", "ReviewID": "R1TFFJ0OXJ646M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The science of the Super CCD sounds really good.  Choosing a sensor arrangement that allows the camera to bin adjacent pixels to increase the effective size of a photosite (at half the number of pixels, of course) is a good idea for reducing both chroma and luminance noise while maintaining a decent shutter speed.  The lower noise level should permit raising the effective ISO.In fact, the Super CCD works pretty well, but not for reducing noise.  It is excellent at extending the dynamic range of the sensor (with one half of the photosites capturing bright and one half capturing dim areas).  The camera has advanced firmware that allows it to do a number of tricks such as shooting 3 pictures in rapid sequence at the same ISO, shutter speed, and aperture, and averaging out the noise.  So long as the photog can hold the camera reasonably steady, this works surprisingly well.  It also has the ability to provide an apparently small depth of field, again by taking 3 pictures of the scene and somehow identifying the subject (closest object, I think) and making one shot of the subject and two of the distance, which it then blurs together.Unfortunately this trick is less well executed.  The background just looks as if somebody had blurred it uniformly, as putting a damp sponge on watercolors.  On one shot the camera even left a hole in the blur through which one could see a fairly sharp background.  Anyway, it only works at all when the subject is quite close to the camera.Even with vibration reduction it is almost impossible to get a sharp image at a 35mm effective \"250 mm\" focal length using a camera this small.  Hand shake and imperfections in the autofocus combine to limit the sharp zoom range to something significantly less, say around \"175mm or 200 mm\" equivalent focal length, if sharpness is important to you.  The lens is also deficient on native sharpness, and when there's a bright background the chromatic aberration (purple fringing) is annoying and not removed by the firmware/software in the camera.  Given the innovative firmware used elsewhere in the camera, some CA reduction and distortion correction should have been implemented.A reasonably sophisticated user will probably find that he or she reaches for the exposure compensation button fairly frequently.  I found that the meter just didn't deliver consistent results as you changed from, say, bright sunlight to an interior.  In addition the auto white balance was consistently off, and the presets didn't help a lot.  Pictures taken on a cloudy day were uniformly too blue, whether engaging the \"shade\" preset or using the AWB.  In compensation, the custom WB mode is very easy to use and works better than on most compacts.The F70EXR is beautifully built, a delight in the hand, and attractively styled.  It's just not as adept at doing bread and butter photography as it should be, even at the pretty low price it's sold for at Amazon.  I am mentally comparing it to a 3 year old Canon 710is and the brand new Canon S90, and have decided that I should return the F70EXR and give the S90 a try.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Simply one of the best \"point and shoots\" I've owned", "Author": "D. Hentze", "ReviewID": "RTZXN8CH9RYWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a long time for a point and shoot that does everything I want it to do, and do it well. The F70EXR has met my desires. Is it a 100% perfect? No, but it's superior to most of my other cameras in what it can do, other than it's weak video. My first thought on taking it out of the box was thank goodness they got rid of the strange USB/video combo cable that came with the F200EXR. The F70 uses a standard mini USB cable, and separate AV cable. The camera itself has an all metal body, and feels well made. Size wise, it is the smallest 10X zoom on the market. It's pretty much the same size as the F200EXR which only has a 5X zoom. All controls are well laid out, and the menus are easy to navigate. The 2.7\" screen is excellent. It's bright and easy to see even in sunlight. After charging the camera up, I ventured out and took about 100 test pictures under various conditions and settings. All in all, the camera performed exceptionally in most areas. There are some minor issues with camera choosing a higher than needed ISO in low lighting using auto mode, but it's not a big deal. Also, some shots came out better by lowering the exposure setting a notch or two. Video is fair at best. It's basic VGA. Nothing more. Nothing less. The battery still shows a full charge after all the testing, so at the least battery life is good. All in all, this is an almost a perfect point and shoot. 10X Zoom. Wide Angle Lens. Manual controls. Well Built. Small size. Excellent results. The only negatives are its mediocre VGA video, and its Image Stabilization is \"fair\". As is the case with the F200EXR, the F70EXR gives better results when \"EXR Auto\" mode is avoided.  The Fuji F70EXR is a keeper, and I recommend it.Pros:Great results under most conditions.Less noise than most cameras at higher ISO.Wide angle lens w/ 10X Zoom.Excellent 2.7\" screen.Well designed and built.Manual controls.Small size.Cons:Image Stabilization is fair.No HD Video.

Kudos to a fine lens to make that possible -- would expect nothing less from Fujinon.Unfortunately, that's just about it for the positives.  And I really am looking at this as a P&S; (point and shoot), not as an SLR (single lens reflex).  On to what really made this camera unworkable:- Terrible noise.  At 400 ISO in low light, it has as much noise as my old F31fd at _1600_ ISO in low light.  (Note: I am comparing the F70 against another P&S;, not an SLR.)  I had hoped that it was just the LCD screen but after loading the craptastic Finepix Viewer on to my laptop (450 MB of bloatware) to ensure that any Fuji-specific import of photos into the laptop was preserved, I find that the noise is just as bad in the end result viewed on screen.  It's to the point where most of the shots, unless in completely bright daylight OUTSIDE were pretty painful to look at.  And forget about cropping a picture because the result blown up cropped section is too noisy.- Shots were blurred even in a brightly lit room even at 800 ISO.  The problem is even a SLIGHT zoom ratchets the aperture beyond f/4.7 which means the shutter has to stay open for a REALLY long time, creating blurred shots.  (Unless you're taking braced shots of things that don't move.)- Largest aperture is f/3.3 whereas the F31fd is a nice, bright f/2.0.  This makes a huge huge difference and is likely the cause of aforementioned blurring.- I thought that the EXR would help with low-light, especially at higher \"sensitivities\" (ISO's).  It didn't.  Shots at 800 and above are basically unusable.- Not sure if this is a trend, but if I pay $250 for a camera, I expect to have a paper manual inside, not just a CD with a PDF on it.  I used this camera while on a business trip and wasn't super excited about propping a laptop up in bed to read about how to use it.- It's BIGGER than the F31fd.  Just as deep and tall, but it's actually longer.In summary, this camera has a beautiful lens but it's wasted because the rest of the features make it impossible to take pictures of anything that might be moving in anything short of bright daylight.  Thinking now that our course of action will be to repair our trusty old F31fd!", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful fit and finish and gorgeous results!

There are a lot of technical bits of information that I have to lookup just to understand.  One thing is for sure, Fuji was never my first choice for a digital camera.  I always thought I would be a Canon girl ... but that has changed.  This is the second Fuji FinePix camera that I have owned and the other FinePix is very similar sans some small photography trinkets like various \"scene modes\", more optical zoom capability and a wider \"wide angle\" lens.  Wide angle is what this new Fuji is all aboutI am comparing two cameras in my review: the Fuji FinePix F70EXR (this one) and the Fuji FinePix F200EXR Fujifilm FinePix F200EXR 12MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Dual Image Stabilized Optical Zoom .  If you look at both of them, the differences are minimal and only slightly cosmetic from the outside.  You will notice a beautiful metal body on both of them.  This is what steered me away from some of the Canon PowerShot cameras  and I currently own the Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom -- and the body is primarily plastic.  This Fuji camera is so well constructed that even in heft (yes, it is heavier than plastic and will weigh down a shirt pocket) you feel like you are getting your money's worth.  It really is remarkable for the money!The greatest differences between the F200EXR and the F70EXR have to do with optical zoom, focal length, digital zoom and wide angle.  If cost is an issue, compare the features you want and need and make the plunge.  In fit and finish they are both very similar except the F200EXR has a slightly larger LCD screen (not much).  Both cameras are so similar that it is worth researching them both and deciding what you want.  The camera you are looking is currently cheaper in price.  So if price is what you are after, this is the camera to grab.  For me, research and comparison works :)With the F70EXR you are getting 10 mega pixels of sheer beauty.  The ability to adjust settings easily (it's the same on the F200EXR) while shooting is one of this camera's high points.  The menus and buttons are very logical and durable.  Since this is a small camera, the notations on and around buttons is small but  appears to be well contrasted to the silver knobs and buttons.  There is only one exception to this rule and it has to be the playback button which is written in green on gray and is very difficult to see.  But this is no deal breaker in my eyes.  You are getting a beautiful camera.The paper manual is great and will get you going in no time.  The camera also comes with a manual on CD that is much more in depth and will help get you through troubleshootingThis camera takes it's own special battery (no AA's which should be something to think about before buying).  You can purchase an extra Fuji battery and can happily exchange them while recharging.  I find that the charges hold quite well.  The charger is a small device that fits directly into the wall.  No heavy AC adaptors to have to lug around.I love this camera for what it does and what it will do as I delve deeper into the manual.

For one, it puts the camera's digital nature front and center and manipulates images to improve them. Starting with the common auto red eye reduction, extending to pixel binning for high dynamic range or low light shots in EXR mode, as well as merging multiple shots in the natural light flash, pro low light and pro focus modes. Couple such digital magic with a great new sensor and a good zoom lens, packaged into a very small, attractive camera, and you have a real winner. In Auto EXR mode it even switches automatically to macro mode when needed, a feature I wanted for the longest time.My favorite mode is EXR high dynamic range. On a recent trip through the Southwest US I pretty much left the camera in this mode with the Velvia film simulation (i.e. vivid colors), and all outdoor shots turned out great. Stunning, vivid colors, good detail in highlights and shadows, and nothing overdone. Simply cool!Originally I bought the F70EXR for low light shots at work because the new sensor and software promised to yield better results than older PnSes, and it does. I have sharp handheld shots without flash that I simply have never been able to take with any other point and shoot (or older SLR for that matter). I alternate between EXR high iso/low noise, natural flash and SP night modes for this, depending on the situation or how much time I have to think and plan.Overall, this camera is fun to use and gives great pictures almost all of the time.Pros:small and lightgreat auto modes, especially high dynamic range EXRnice 10x zoom lens - love the rangegreat sensor, larger than average for PnSsmart softwarefast focus and time to shoothigh quality bright displayCons:pronounced purple fringing (chromatic aberration) around bright, high contrast edgesfinicky zoom lever - I wish it had two levels of sensitivityQuibbles:mode wheel turns too easily for mesome modes have overlapping features, makes choices confusing (e.g. Astia film simulation for soft tones vs. two portrait modes which promise soft skin tones)multi shot modes are impossible if subject doesn't hold absolutely stillon/off button somewhat difficult to find by touch for mewould be nice if the lens defaulted to somewhere between 35 and 50 mm equivalent focal length instead of the very wide angle 27 mm", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "great pocket camera!  3 years on!", "Author": "john k mt", "ReviewID": "REKR2PYF4HPPX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a camera with more zoom than our Canon SD (I also use 2 DSLRs and film cameras).

What is unique to the F70 is that you can either use it as a regular 10MP camera, or set it up to be extra senstitive for low light or add dynamic range in shadow areas. The extra sensitivity drops you down to 5MP, but in most cases, that is a good trade off to be able to take less noisy pics in low light or bring out the detail in shadow areas.

Kim \"Zelium\"", "ReviewID": "R3DKMBAUAV8WR0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My last point and shoot digital camera was a 2 mega pixel camera from Canon (Digital Elph S200).  Then I bought my first DSLR, the Nikon D70.  Ever since, I loved my D70 so much and I thought that I would not need a point and shoot camera any more. Wrong.  I realized that the D70 was heavy for me and I did not carry it unless I really really needed it.  The number of the pictures that I took have been decreasing and finally, I wanted to have a compact camera that I could carry anywhere easily.  And I did not want to sacrifice the picture quality.  Then here comes the Fuji F70EXR.I have a friend who has been using only Fuji digital cameras.  He loves the compactness and the picture quality of Fuji Finepix cameras, and I was surprised by the pictures that the Fuji cameras took.  So, I was expecting that the F70EXR would take great pictures and yes, it does take beautiful pictures even in conditions that most compact digital cameras do not like..These days, almost any digital cameras from well known companies can take gorgeous pictures under bright daylight.  So my focus goes to the point on how great pictures that the F70EXR can take in low light conditions.  As a matter of fact, I take more pictures indoor than outdoor since I take pictures of my kids most of the time.  The F70EXR offers a special mode called pro low-light mode.  What it does is that it takes 4 continuous pictures under the low light condition and combines those 4 shots into 1 picture to make the picture brighter and the picture has surprisingly low noise.  You should not shake your camera while it is taking 4 shots in a row though.  Once I got used to it, I was able create a very nice picture under dim lights, such as candles on a birthday cake.  This is the best program that I found on the F70EXR.  If you have shaky hands, you would get blurry (but bright) pictures, though.  The F70EXR has another low light mode called a high sensitivity and low noise, and it creates decent pictures indoor.  However, I liked the pro low-light mode better, since it makes a great picture under the extreme light condition that most cameras fail to make decent pictures.The second program mode that I really like from the F70EXR is the pro focus mode. It mimicks a DSLR camera in a very interesting way.  Several of my friends bought DSLR cameras just to take soft focus background pictures.  People love portrait pictures that have a sharp focus for the subject with soft focus for the background. To create these type of pictures, you would need a bright lens for your DSLR.  However, without changing or buying a comparatively expensive lens, you can do that with the F70EXR by selecting the pro focus mode.  The F70EXR recognizes the background and blurs it so that it looks like a blurred background picture.  I never expected this kind of picture from a point and shoot camera, and I really enjoyed it.  I recommended the F70EXR to my friend who wanted to take this kind of picture without knowing much about the camera.I also liked the natural & flash mode that takes 2 continuous pictures with and without the flash. I frequently use this mode when I do not know whether I should fire a flash or not.  This is a pretty good idea.  I do not know whether this feature is popular among other cameras, however, it has been working very well for me.  And there are just too many program modes that I cannot describe here one by one.Oh, I should mention this.  This camera has a built-in memory which is approximately 47 MB.  This was a life saver for me when I forgot to bring a memory card.  I could have lost precious moments if there were no internal memory in it. I thank Fuji for that.The one thing that I did not like the most is that it does not have a motion senser to record if the picture is taken horizontally or vertically.  You need to manually rotate pictures when you see the pictures on the computer screen (or any device that can show the digital pictures).  And the video can be taken only up to 640 * 480 resolution in 30 frames per second.  I see many compact digital cameras  on the market taking HD videos. However, I have HD camcorders to do this job, so this does not bother me much.Since other reviewers have pointed out so many features of this camera, I was focusing on the things that I really like.  Overall, the F70EXR is a very good camera to have.  The F70EXR feels solid and takes great pictures under low light conditions which I care about the most.  And many program modes can be accessed very easily.  If you are not sure about which point and shoot digital camera to buy, but take many pictures indoor, the F70EXR would be the best choice for you.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "The F70EXR can blow your mind.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1QS350C4D6ZDK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why do I say that the camera can blow your mind? Because it is capable of delivering truly excellent images under a remarkable range of conditions. First, it has very credible 1600 ISO. And usable 3200 ISO. I will give you links at the end where you can verify that I am not making this up. This high ISO ability allows you to shoot indoors and get decent images. The fancy modes, pro focus and pro low light, so work, although the subject must remain quite still. But you can get remarkably clean images. Again, I have plenty of examples at the links I provide.When you take the camera outdoors, you will see that it is very good at controlling exposures and managing dynamic range. I shoot in P mode almost all the time, setting auto ISO 1600, M3:2 as the size (5mp), and DR400% mode. That is the most flexible setting for indoors and out. You can set EXR DR mode up with flash if you want a quick way to get the same behavior with the flash on. The two settings are next to each other on the dial and this makes for super convenience.The lense is far from perfect, being a 10x zoom. It shows CA more often than some others, but what you get for that price in incredible reach. Mine happens to be very sharp, although some have complained about blurry corners. I've seen their images, and they are a bit blurry, but most people shooting snaps won't even notice. The lens is decently stabilized so that, once you learn to relax when you shoot and hold the cam steady, you can get really crisp close ups from a long way away.The manual controls add real spice to this cam. I was able to shoot a crisp image of the moon and tonight I was able to shoot Jupiter with FOUR Galilean moons visible. That's an incredible feat from a compact camera. I used a tripod, but it is still amazing.These are not minor accomplishments ... I have many images in my gallery and on my blog, along with extensive tests and explanations.

Unfortuntely, I concluded that I need something that is simpler, has less opportunities to mess up, and that will consistently take excellent photos inside and out without having to adjust the settings.I bought this camera to replace an aging Canon S50 that is used for family photos inside and outside. After spending hours trying to satisfy myself that this was a good replacement (particularly with respect to inside snapshots), I decided that if I had to work that hard to get the snapshots I wanted, that this was not the right  camera for me. I suspect a serious photographer would reach a different conclusion.I did make a few observations in comparing it with my wife's Canon SD870 and my older Canon S50. All three cameras can take great pictures indoor and out. Since indoor photos seem to be much more difficult than outdoor photos I spent my time trying to get the best indoor snapshots. I found that F70 in auto modes consistently pushed the ISO to higher levels than the Canon cameras and it seemed to me that this tended to result in grainier photos. Most of the Canon shots were automatically set at around 100 ISO whereas the F70 only shot at 100 if I set it there. The rest of the time it went to 400 or higher. With the F70 I found that I liked the indoor photos the best if I set the ISO at 200 or 100, At the 100 ISO I had to correct the photos on the computer. With the Canon cameras the auto setting gave me much better results with a lot less opportunity to make mistakes.The F70 has a ton of capabilities, but after spending 5 or 6 hours shooting test shots I concluded that I want a camera that consistently takes good snapshots inside or outside without having to change settings. The F70 is not that camera. It clearly can take excellent photos, but the firmware does not make it idiot-proof like our Canon cameras tend to be.All in all, while I think this is an excellent camera, I do not think it is an excellent camera for casual family photos.

My camera quit working one month after the warranty expired -- naturally. It would turn on and the lens would extend, but the LCD screen was blank and it didn't appear to be taking photos. In disgust, I put it a drawer so I wouldn't throw it against the wall. Only later, when I put the memory card in my computer, I learned the camera was still taking photos, just not displaying them. So I did hours of online research and learned that it would cost well over a hundred dollars to fix it -- IF they fixed it. Then I found a source for do-it-yourself replacement screens -- [...]---html -- for around $25. Okay, so I took off the back to see if I thought the repair was doable before I spent more money on it. I poked around a bit and it did in fact looked doable, so I buttoned it back up. Just for the heck of it, I turned it back on and -- you guessed it -- it's working perfectly.It wouldn't surprise me if it fails again, but for now I'm relieved. But I would advise people to stay away from this camera. My research turned up quite a few problems and fuji's service is, by all accounts, pathetic. And in addition to this problem, I'm kind of disappointed in the general image quality, and low-light images are pretty bad.**********While I'm a long-time user of Nikon 35mm gear, I had zero digital camera experience prior to this purchase, so it was with some trepidation that I sought out an online best buy solution in the point and shoot category. To that end, I must confess that I found most of the online reviews rather confusing, which, now that I have test-run one, I attribute to too many reviewers unfairly critiquing a recreational camera in a context that references higher-end cameras and features. (I did find the reviews here on Amazon to be the most useful.) For example, it threw me off whenever a reviewer would complain about a point-and-shoot's graininess in low light situations, when in fact no point-and-shoot is going to pass that test very well with existing technology. I finally figured this out after days of researching and once I had revised my hopes and expectations, the Fujifilm F70 seemed like a good choice, even if it was a bit pricier than I had originally budgeted.My criteria for a point-and-shoot were, in order of importance:* Obviously, compactness and portability, but not at the cost of desirable features.* The best possible image quality across a wide range of conditions.* The most powerful, trouble-free zoom in this category.* Price.* Solid construction.* No AA batteries.* A good balance between versatile features and ease of use, including anti-blur and file transfer.* The brand track record.* Cosmetic style.* Battery life.Based on that wish list and a week of experimentation, I must say that overall I am relieved and pleased with my choice of cameras, and give this one a solid 4 stars. (I doubt I would give any point-and-shoot 5 stars until someone does in fact deliver one that produces exceptional image quality in all the light conditions a typical user is likely to encounter.) Other reviewers with more digital expertise have critiqued its features better than I can at this point, so I'll limit my observations to a few notes from a newbie's perspective:* First, digital is cool.* Second, this camera is indeed capable of producing really nice photos under optimum conditions, and acceptable snapshots in less than ideal situations.* The EXR mode is really interesting, and I bet it and the programmed manual mode wind up being the ones I use most.* It seems like a digital is prone to blur more than a SLR, and I'm not sure the F70's anti-blur is all that great.* The 10x zoom is a really nice feature to have in a compact camera. Some people had mentioned the control being too touchy, but I think it's acceptable. I tend to think of it as zooming in preset increments rather than being infinitely adjustable like a SLR lens, which is, again, acceptable in a recreational camera.* Another thing that had worried me was mention of purple fringing -- I almost didn't buy this camera because of it -- but after taking a couple hundred photos, this seems like a non-issue. I have yet to see any.* I don't have anything to compare it to, but it does seem like the camera goes through a battery charge pretty quickly, but of course I've been doing lots of experimenting and button pushing. I'd say it's a really good idea to have a spare battery on hand.* I don't claim to have mastered all the controls yet, but I'm satisfied that the automated settings in AUTO and EXR modes may be fine for optimum conditions, but the user does need to learn how to tweak the settings for less than optimum shooting. To that end, I'm surprised to see such a robust feature set in a point-and-shoot camera, but at the same time I'm aware that some situations simply require a more sophisticated camera. In other words, you can't win 'em all with a point-and-shoot.* The zoom motor's noise is a nuisance in video mode (I assume other brand's are able to avoid that?). And if other brands at comparable prices are shooting HD, why not this camera? Not a big deal though.* I'm really irritated that I have to go to the computer to access the complete user manual, which is the only way you're going to figure out the camera's more intricate features. I find this enormously inconvenient, especially since I don't have a laptop. Fuji gets a really low mark from me on this feature -- 2 stars. Come on guys, it would cost you, what, a buck to print the whole damn thing? Geez.In conclusion, I'd like to mention a couple of industry practices in general. When you're spending upwards of US$200 for a point-and-shoot, I think the manufacturer should furnish a more complete kit that includes a full manual, a memory card and a case. I'm not saying I expect a 16gig card and a $40 case for a $234 camera, but 1 or 2 gigs and an econo case would be nice. (Or better yet, why isn't there more data storage built into the camera?) Honestly, I don't know why we consumers allow vendors to strong arm us into after-market sales like that. I think it's blatantly manipulative.

We went to Roger Williams Park Zoo in Rhode Island and this was the perfect camera for the day.  It fit in my pocket, was easy to use and changing the settings with one finger was fantastic.  The colors are great and I used a few different settings with the same subjects to see what the difference was and to be honest I couldn't find a whole lot of difference.The one thing that I liked the best was the stabilizer.  My hands always shake a bit and so usually taking pics really stinks as they are blurry or worse but this baby did great.  I felt like a kid in a candy shop running around taking pics of different things and having them come out great.

My review is not intended for the deep hobbyist.  If you are one, you may well agree with my rating and conclusions, but the detail you need is to be found in these other reviews, especially the shot-by shot-documentation of each feature, available on blogs and other fora.No camera is perfect.  I cannot do with only one or two.  Engineering design is the art of trade-offs.  So I begin by giving my conclusions on who will most likely agree with my five stars.  Firstly, this rating rests upon this price point being comfortably within your budget.  Double the price and maybe it becomes a four.  Quadruple it and you are in a different class altogether.  Yet you can find acceptable quality if your budget still needs something 20-25% lower.- Good for the complete novice, yet worthy of serious consideration by the demanding hobbyist.  Easy to use immediately with loads to explore over time.- Good for those who never want to leave home without a camera in your pocket or in a dedicated section of handbag, but not for careless carrying.  The build quality is fine but the shutter is vulnerable because there is no lens cap.  I use a small bag for extra protection when in heavy action. The rear screen that you use to see your shots is a tad less recessed than before. Therefore you want to guard against careless abrasion were you to set it down.- Good for travel.  I bought two extra batteries for a day away from the hotel.- Good for birders, as if anything were ever good enough.- Good for bright outdoors and fast action.FinePix's F70EXR has 10x zoom (compared to the far more common 3x-5x zoom of other models) ; it is a noticeable touch lighter in weight and is proportionately smaller.The F70 allows me to frame high contrast pictures in the Phoenix full sun with better results. Similarly, the Super i-Flash prevents whiteouts. I am amazed by the good pictures taken in the near dark with natural low light. Pictures of fireworks look saturated with color like my old 25 ASA film. Pictures of the moon, using a tripod, are remarkable.You are trading down in resolution to ten mega-pixel, and really, more like five.  Only you can decide how much that matters in this pocket size.  I clearly prefer the full twelve of the F200EXR, but that is only because of my photographic targets and inclinations.  Likewise the macro mode is quite adequate for those close ups of flowers, but not best in class.  Another worthy comparison would be the Canon G10, but the tradeoff in price may not suit you sufficiently.I am not bothered by the video quality.  You get audio, and it is there for those rare times when you are just thankful you had video in quick and easy reach.  If movies are that important, better look elsewhere.If you plan to do lots of set-up shots, especially in lower natural light, a tripod will be most useful along with the portrait mode and lighting options.  Things like good breathing and elbow rests help stability on the go.Finally, for you new to this mania, er, hobby, there is an interesting learning curve.  The rank beginner can be taking pictures successfully in the time it takes to charge the battery.  Just use the time to read the first few section of the user manual.  If you never want to go beyond the basics, there is a new world of options and features from the latest generation of sensors and signal processing.  Be aware that, although the camera stands alone, there is additional software available.  Then there is the whole world of post-processing that changes your camera to a front end and your computer the middle to back end.  There is so much to work through that the learning curve can have a low slope after the first day.  The best way to get through the steep curve is to keep good records of all settings and choices so you can learn in a focused, aware manner.  You will understand your preferences, and the Fuji's limitations. If the very idea of that approach gives you a headache, just keep it simple.  But you are missing a lot of fascinating power and flexibility.  All engineering design is managing trade-offs.  The art of design is fitting the package together well.

Many of the other reviews explain more technical specifications, I consider myself a novice/general user.  I enjoy taking a camera along for family bike rides, events or just to take a picture of the family dogs.  This camera pretty much can do everything for me, all I have to do is adjust the zoom and push the button.  Fujifilm's EXR technology can automatically adjust to the scene you are taking a picture of, no matter if it is a landscape or a portrait. It will adjust the color balance, focus and exposure - in other words the camera automatically selects the correct settings instead of you speculating which setting to use.  Of course for you savvy camera users, you can always override the feature and put it into manual mode.  The face detection recognition can discover and focus on up to 10 faces and it will even correct red-eye instantly without having to turn that feature on.  The dual stabilization allows a faster shutter speed and handles \"shaky hands\", but I did not see where it was incredible.  Some pictures come out perfect while others were still blurry. I honestly believe no camera can take perfect pictures all the time (but I might be wrong since I am not a professional photographer).The only thing I found a little frustrating was that the zoom dial is EXTREMELY sensitive.  One little touch with your finger and it will change the camera view drastically.  Just be very careful not to hit the dial when snapping the picture.Overall, this is an excellent \"on-the-go/take anywhere\" camera.

The real magic is in the way this takes still photos.Very small, very thin - stylish. It fits in your pocket and feels solid. It's like a netbook in that it has all the features of a desktop in short hand. All the previous super thin digital point and shoots were sexy, but they took crappy pictures. So I guess you looked cool with it but that was about it.There's almost no shutter lag with this at any setting. It's as fast as an old style film camera and just as accurate. It also does a LOT more than any manual camera ever could. The included programs are not superfluous cool toy candy - they actually work.The big problem the F70EXR kills is how to use all those features without constantly playing with the camera. I mean, it's nice and then here you are surfing through sub menus and drama while stuff is happening right in front of you. EXR mode handles all of it. It's even printed in red right on the primary features wheel on the back of the housing. You just put it there and find something to take a picture of. It does everything but zoom (you do that yourself). If you put the camera in full display mode you can watch it cycle through all of its enhancements when you focus on something. It's pretty mind blowing and works really well. This is not some wonder toy that just bumps up contrast or some other neato trick that looks good but achieves little: it takes seriously dense pictures that are super easy to edit if you feel like it.It seems to work best when you are close to your subject.  It does give you autofocus warnings and low light jaggedy symbols if it is having a hard time. What's really impressive is that it solves its own problem by switching to a different aperture setting, filter or algorithm.  You can watch it work, and it is very fast. You can also play with the settings yourself while it's working, like give it a clue.The zoom is awesome, and the anti-shake works out well. The only problems I had with it was when I used the macro to take pictures of jewelry for auctions. I am used to a camera that is finicky about low light levels, so I have to play with multiple lights from all different angles before I can get something half way decent to edit in Photoshop. The multiple lights I usually use freaked out the autofocus in EXR mode. When I switched to other modes, it told me `unable to render effect'. This was totally my fault for not taking the time to find out what this camera's needs are. It's not like other cameras: it's special.I found I did not have to use half the junk I usually set up because the F70EXR just rocks all over low light levels and has a superior flash. I could actually use the flash without bleaching out what I was shooting. It took me a while to figure out that I could actually squash my tripod right up against the shiny surfaces I was shooting without losing color or focus. It also has a sort of dual mode where it will take two pictures simultaneously: one with flash and one in natural light mode. It displays the pictures side by side so you can see what the difference is and decide what is best for you. I found that to be a serious help when deciding whether to repress the flash or not.The lens does love to be placed right up flush with things - something most digital cameras I have owned will not put up with. However, if you try for an extreme zoom in low light - it will have fits and give you all sorts of warnings. It also won't focus and gives you all sorts of color drama that is not easy to correct. I am pretty sure this is because of lighting. When I tried an extreme zoom outside in bright daylight it was happy enough to do whatever I wanted to. This is a user error, certainly. Like someone else posted, the F70EXR does tend to be a little iso happy, but you can tell it to stop that and then it's fine. You can do something like a macro you would do in Photoshop, tell it to remember those settings and it will while using the automatic features.In summary - this thing is a low light wonder. It is also dead easy to use and super productive. I love the ultra bright LCD that gives decent previews too. What a mind blower: All the functionality of a high end film camera with extra tricks (that really do work) and no bulky stupid case full of enhancements to drag around with you. Technology: what a concept. If you are the type to blow $600 on a manual Leica you may want to consider going digital with something like this. It's getting there, people. And it's a lot cheaper, too. The only bummer is that you are stuck with this one lens but weirdly enough you can program it to do things that would ordinarily take several lenses to accomplish. So don't freak out at the price. This isn't like you buy a camera body and then have to get lenses: these modern cameras change aspect on command. And they do it so well!

Thef Fuji is a very nice camera.My initial impression was WOW.  Looking at the first few pictures I took on the camera's display.  In one case, in EXR mode, I pointed the camera into a dark room and it was almost like looking through a (normal color, not greenish) night vision scope.  It was clearer on the display than it was in real life.I was truly impressed.Then I examined the pictures on my computer and reality set in.  Zoomed out, the pictures looked good, then I viewed them 1:1 and they were very very noisy.  All of the pictures I had taken to that point, about 50, were taken indoors with default settings.I started playing with the settings.  I found all the Auto ISO setting pretty useless (for me).  The Auto ISO settings have a maximum ISO they will shoot at and every single picture that I shot was taken with that maximum, no variation in the ISO, even when the camera used the flash.  When I manually set the ISO to 400 or less, the pictures produced were much better and of course, the lower the ISO, the less noise.This is something I don't understand at all.  In auto EXR mode, the camera could decide to change the image size.  With memory cards and disk space so cheap and plentiful, I would never shoot a picture at anything but the highest resolution and lowest compression, even if the pictures are huge.  I can always crop or compress them later.In daylight the auto mode performs much better, using a lower ISO, but not all the time. It still shot at the maximum ISO some of the time.  At ISO 100 or 200, whether in manual or auto, the pictures are beautiful.  At ISO 400, there is a little noise.  At higher ISO the noise gets a lot worse each step up the ISO ladder.I'm not into movies on point and shoot cameras; I use a high definition camcorder when I want to shoot movies.  But for those that do, the movies are nice and you can zoom while recording, but you will hear the zoom on the audio.In summary, if you manually set the ISO to 100 or 200, you will get real nice pictures both indoors and outdoors.  ISO over that and you will get noise, but you will get usable pictures.  I think Fuji has set the auto modes to try and use the fastest shutter speed it can to avoid shake blur and not rely on the image stabilizer as much.  I personally hope they change this with a firmware update.Aesthetically the camera is very nice, small and easy to handle.  Compared to one of it's major competitors, the Canon SX200IS, both have pluses and minuses.  The Canon performs better in \"Auto\" modes, cannot zoom while recording (also has 720OHD recording) and is significantly bigger.  The Fuji does better in low light, is smaller and battery life is much better.Both are good choices.

I prefer cameras that use AA/AAA batteries, which can easily be replaced in a pinch.No viewfinderFragility- this is more a perceived shortcoming, as my previous camera was an Olympus UZ-550, a small, but solid camera.

I was hoping it was THE ONE And as you might expect from my title of this review, it filled almost all my expectations and then some. First this is small and compact with a nice metal case and will fit my purse or pocket well. In fact it is so thin for a 10x Optical Zoom camera that I had to check the box to be sure they didn't send me the wrong camera.  It is such a nice Tidy small camera that makes it a camera you can take with you everywhere.I did a side by side compareson with the Fuji F70EXR and my other super zoom cameras, one a Panasonic and the other a Samsung and the third a Canon. Taking the same shot with all 4 of them. Well again I am going to say the Vividness of the colors of the Fuji was very easy to see without any photo editing. The sharp clarity was easy to detect.Ok, what made this camera the best choice for me are a few items no other camera in the class offers:It has all the usual functions from the simple Auto function to totally Manual control and all the nice variations in the middle. All controlled by a simple small dial on the body of the camera. There are very few buttons to confuse the average user. A simple switch chg of the dial and It does video but not in HD. But what it does have that none of the others is a far Superior configuration to get the BEST and SHARPEST PICTURES. YES !!  *1. it has got this new Super Sensor.. what that means to me is it make much better and sharper pictures.than any competitor in this size and features.( I have several competitors in my camera bag)  *2. it has not ONE not TWO but THREE levels of Image Stabilization.. WOW WOW... no unintended blurry pictures even when hand holding this long zoom.  * 3.- a few other bells and whistle items that allows me to make SUPER Sharp picture.. i.e. the increased dynamic range,Color Filter Array which arranges the way red and blue pixels are placed amongst green pixels These are the things you usually only get on higher end cameras.  * 4. And possibly the the Biggest WOW for ME was it's also capable of combining two or three shots together to form a single image using the function called Pro Low-Light and Pro Focus modes. This lets you capture a photo where the person or thing your taking the picture of, is as sharply focused as possible. You get this super crisp shot against a defocused background and foreground. Great for Pictures of your kids or nature shots, or animals in the fields or anything that needs `lifting' from its background. The is achieved by just one chg in the camera ..... Another Big WOW  Now if that is too much technical jargon for you lets just say, in my opinion, this camera will give you the richest and most vibrant shots of any camera in the super zoom, point and shoot category, at this time.They didn't add that Super Sensor for nothing..  I went to the beach and did both Sunrise shots as well later in the day to do the sunset shotsand WOW ! The glow on the ocean was amazing. The colors were so vivid. The orange sunset was stunning.

So far, I have owned 6~7 pockets cameras and this one is the best.I have only one issue with this camera. Basing on the expert's suggestion, the pictures taken at 10mp might not be better than the ones at 5mp. Following the suggestion, I feel like getting a 5mp camera instead of a 10mp camera though the PQ is very good at 5mp.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fuji F70 comes through in the dark", "Author": "Greg Zeck", "ReviewID": "R2HKZ69UAH6YFX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As the reviews suggest, this is a good point-and-shoot digital camera for low light situations. Quite amazing what you can pick up in the dark or near dark, though image quality will not be the same. Also the camera has quite a few new program wrinkles, including one that takes three shots in low light and stitches them together, one that takes two shots (one with and one without flash), and various others, including manual. There's a learning curve to the camera, but you can start shooting, and enjoying the results, right out of the box. The camera is a bit heavier and larger than I expected, but still nicely compact.

This Fuji has been a pleasant surprise!  It takes remarkable night pictures.Recently, I had to photograph Christmas lights on my home and it was foggy outside.  I kept thinking the pictures would turn out horrible, but I used the \"fireworks\" setting to get a really long exposure and when I uploaded the pictures to my computer and finally viewed them on the big screen, I was shocked (and thrilled) that you couldn't even tell it was foggy outside.  I am so pleased with the \"low noise\" on nighttime photos that I highly recommend this camera for that reason alone.  I've never found another digital camera that was worth a darn for night shots, so if you think you may ever need to take a picture with dim lighting and no flash, you need a camera like this one. (I use a tripod when photographing with long exposures.  I highly suggest everyone who owns a digital camera invest in a tripod.  They are relatively cheap and completely necessary when photographing at night.)I read the manual thoroughly before using this camera, but I love how intuitive all the features and buttons are, making the manual unnecessary to keep on you at all times.  I have another camera that I've owned for 2 years and I still can never remember how to scroll through the menus and what button does what.  This is not the case with this Fuji camera.  The menus are super-intuitive and once you've gone through them a couple of times, you know just what to do.All of the auto-options are phenomenal.  With several different night exposure settings and tons of different day/landscape settings, you'll never run out of photo-taking options for your subject. The zoom is great, quick, and relatively silent.The size and weight of this camera are good, but it could probably be shrunk down just a bit more.  I have to ding it just a bit on this because it is heavier and larger than my other digital cameras, but this extra weight and bulk may be necessary for all the options on this.I've seriously thought of purchasing one of these for my mother.  She's not very tech-savvy, but I know she can handle the easy buttons and menus on this camera and would feel confident and comfortable using it.  I cannot say that for my other digital cameras, so as a gift, I think this is a great camera for a recipient of any age.", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Mucking up a good thing", "Author": "JAD \"TechMan\"", "ReviewID": "R38OXWBPSL13E6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not sure why Fuji engineers had to go off and muck up a pretty good formula they've succeeded with on the previous F series.  I've owned Fuji cameras for years (this is my 5th one) and have always liked their low light capabilities and simple menus.  This new EXR capability seems to detract both the design and complicate the low light capabilities.  I tried a whole series of configurations at a recent wedding and found the low level performance - with EXR and with the natural Light - to be useless.  That's a dramatic drop in performance from my previous F60 that faithfully produced the best images in low light when every one else's cameras were struggling with noise. I've also found that EXR add processing lag.  you have to wait a tad longer before you can take the next pic. The remaining features of the camera are fabulous. In good light the optics and processor produce terrific, high grade images with wonderful and vivid color. The 10x lens can't be beat.

The low-light high-ISO looks very badly, I don't have words to describe. Overall, I would not give it more then one star, even though the form-factor is \"nice\". The famous and highly praised 10x zoom is very cumbersome: it zooms in and out too quickly, one cannot ever get the frame as wished.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix F70EXR Digital Camera", "Author": "Loveguitar", "ReviewID": "RS4AKJTSHXBTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a high quality camera, but you must take time to read through the owner's manual to understand how to get the best pictures.  You can just grab it and point and shoot using it while in the \"automode\" setting, but the resulting pictures may leave you a little disappointed depending upon the photographic conditions.  To get the highest quality photos you must become familiar with how this little beauty works.  Unfortunately, you might have to print out and tote the manual with you when you find yourself in situations where your pictures aren't what you'd like, or you can't figure out how to do certain things like know what's behind the flashing icon error message, or how to simulate different types of film, or can you choose between clarity, reduced noise and dynamic range?  This is not really a simple \"point and shoot\" camera and all images will turn out great.  You will have to study it, practice with it, and most of all have patience and you will be pleasantly rewarded for your efforts. Though the indicators vary with camera settings, there are 23 different indicators just for shooting mode, and 12 for playback mode, not to mention the date/time stamp, battery level, and indicator.  It can get confusing.Although a basic manual booklet is included with the camera, a much more detailed manual must be uploaded from the enclosed CD and then all 125 pages can be printed out or read from your computer monitor.  The manual covers all the material in the booklet almost page for page but includes much more information about features the booklet leaves out and the booklet will refer you to specific pages in the manual for more information.  Also, in the manual are about 50 FAQ's that are very useful. I am a manual reader, (having written many technical SOP's) and appreciate having well-written and well thought out manuals that are understandable and succinct.  Though I would have preferred a manual that I don't have to upload to my computer, it is well-written and many useful pictures are included.This camera is loaded with many different options/features but accessing and understanding many of them will require reading the manual.  For people who don't want to be bothered with all the bells and whistles this camera may be more than they need.  I can see very serious photographers using this camera.  Reading through the manual I have compiled a list of some of the various modes, options and features available:Digital ZoomMovie ModeSilent ModeVariable ISO settingsImage size selectionAspect Ratio selectionIntelligent Face detectionScene PositionShooting ModesEXR ModeFilm simulationDynamic RangeWhite BalanceContinuous PhotographyPhotometry - multi, spot, averagePlayback Options:EraseSlide ShowRed-eye RemovalImage RotationProtection from accidental deletionCropResizeVoice MemoPrint OrderTime DifferenceFormatPages 37, 67-68, 86-87, 97-103, and 104-107 would be good to print out and keep with your camera as they contain tables of various camera functions and a trouble shooting chart.I have taken many pictures and movies inside and out, light and dark, with this camera set on various settings.  And though I have practiced with it now for several weeks, I still need to often refer to the manual when I choose to vary from automode. Some things I have found especially desirable are:Silent Mode - I attend classical music concerts where flash photography is prohibited.  This mode will silence all beeps and flashes.Large viewing screen on the back of the camera.  It is exactly 5.5cm x 4.0 cm.Digital Zoom - extremely good.  I attended a local minor-league baseball game and sat far away on the grass well beyond the playing field.  I was able to fully zoom and still get good, clear, close-up shots of the players with no blurring.Movie Mode - Completely surpasses any other I've experienced so far.  Images are clear, colorful and the sound quality is excellent.  Camera noise was heard and recorded while using the \"zoom\" function in Movie Mode though it was not very loud.Multi-frame play back function is very useful to quickly scan for a particular picture.Fine Pix Viewer Program was very easy to install on my computer.  I use Windows XP.Very good photography in low-light conditions.Also some things I did not find particularly desirable but are not major flaws:I cannot directly burn a CD using the Fine Pix Viewer Program which comes with this camera.  I have to use another camera program, import the pictures into it and then burn a CD.Very easy to accidentally turn it on or off and easy to get misfires.The zoom lever is too sensitive.  I have learned with practice to barely move it very slowly.The camera does not give helpful suggestions on how to get a better picture as does my HP R717.Not HD capable.The higher the ISO the grainier the picture though a higher ISO is desirable when shooting in dim/low light levels.  I have set the ISO level to 200 and that seems to produce the best pictures so far.Almost too many options, modes and functions to choose from.  Though you can immediately begin to take pictures using Automode, it will take time to fully understand the many other aspects and features this camera has.In Summary:I can find no major complaint concerning this camera.  It takes excellent clear and colorful photos even in situations where I least expect it - indoors with no flash.  Any poor quality pictures I have taken are not the fault of the camera but due to the photographer's ignorance of how to use/understand properly the many features of the camera.  The basic mechanics of such things as battery and memory card installation are very easy.  Battery charging is a very simple process and battery life seems long.  The manual is detailed and covers more than I would probably care to know.  This is almost more camera than I need, though I will continue to use it and will update this review as necessary.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fugi Finepix F70", "Author": "C.

I have been using a Kodak and got spoiled with setting the camera on a dock overnight to charge it. Granted removing the battery is not a big chore but having it charge without removing it would have brought this review to near perfect. It would also be nice if the camera allowed for smaller (web) pictures. With the lowest resolusion setting the pictures are still just shy of a meg. I do a lot of posting to websites with reports and many of those sites won't accept pictures over 300kb. This means I need to resize the pictures. An extra step I would rather not have to take. But all in all Fujifilm has a winner here. If they can add a lower resolution setting and the ability to charge the camera without removing it...then I would trade up in a second.

I couldn't believe how much better this tiny little camera was when it came to capturing the details and colors of every stitch compared to this other camera with supposedly more zoom power. He said it was because this is the new generation -- tiny with a better lens and processor. I returned the first one and happily played with my new camera, easily taking shots in all light conditions, action shots of the kids, black & white or sepia, movies without sound, etc. I even took a picture of my son in his daycare class through the thick glass window with diamond-shaped metal wire inside it (it's on an army post, so, of course, security glass is everywhere) and instead of focusing on the wire inside the glass like every camera I've ever had before would have done, this took a clear picture of the room. He was the only person in the shot and I was able to zoom in digitally later on with the \"crop\" option and get a clear picture of how excited and cute he looks when he first sees Daddy coming to pick him up at the end of the day.

There was some noise, but that's to be expected.The F70EXR also has a feature that allows the photographer to take pictures in low light without using the flash.  In this case, the camera snaps 3 quick images and then combines them, thereby reducing noise in low light situations.  I found this feature helpful.  I was able to take images in a dark room without a flash and have them turn out, provided people were relatively still.  They weren't perfect images, but without using a tripod, they were the best I have seen with any camera.For general use, the F70EXR takes nice pictures too.

I've tried both the standard setting and the \"Velvia\" - vivid settings. I've tried auto and also Manual.

I had been looking for a camera that could take decent quality indoor photos, and while SLR cameras are better suited for indoor photography, they seemed like overkill for a casual photo taker and are far outside my price range.  The F70EXR looked like an ideal camera for my needs: good quality low light images and reasonable price.  After reading several positive reviews, I purchased one.After using it for several days, I am very disappointed.  The image quality is absolutely atrocious.  It appears to me as though the camera's firmware applies some sort of overly-aggressive noise reduction to the images, perhaps as a means to compensate for the unnecessarily high ISO settings the camera tends to default to.  The end result is that fine details such as hair, fur, grass, leaves, text, etc that appear in the image are muddied together into an indistinct blur of color.  A friend commented that the photos from this camera look like impressionist paintings.  While some level of noise reduction is certainly useful for preventing the characteristic graininess one sees with high ISO images, Fuji's engineers went overboard with it, and even ISO 100 images taken in daylight come out unacceptably blotchy.  Chromatic aberration is a big problem as well.  This camera produces terrible purple fringing around dark objects photographed in bright light, and it is far more pronounced with this camera than with other pocket-sized point-and-shoots with tiny lenses (my brother's Canon Powershot SD850IS, for example).Here's a sample from Fuji's own sample photo page that demonstrates the blotchiness I'm describing: [...]I wish I had found those sample images before I bought the camera.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "warranty refused to stand by their prouct", "Author": "D Sexton", "ReviewID": "R359M8LW3YF90K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will never buy a fuji camera again.They have a bad warranty coverage.

I heard there were some compact cameras with 10x zoom, so I was intruiged.I took sample photos with my old canon and new fujifilm. I didn't spend too long, maybe 2 hours shooting and comparing. however, there were some things that helped me determine nearly right away that this is not the camera for me. I found one (big)pro and several cons, and then decided to stop wasting my time:1. pro: the 10x zoom is awesome! I got an amazing amount of detail, even when I blew it up on my computer. these were outdoor shots so the lighting condition was ideal.2. con: manual mode: on the canon, I could choose the lowest ISO (which is 80) and then the camera would automatically set the proper f-stop and shutter speed (a low ISO is good because you'll get the least amount of noise possible). the fujifilm did not do that. once I put it on the lowest ISO (only 100), it was up to ME to determine the f-stop and shutter speed. BOO. I don't have THAT much time to fool around with settings. once I figured out the proper shutter speed, the image was mediocre.3. con: image stabilization (part 1): if I do need a slow shutter speed (so I don't have to use a high ISO or flash), then I want image stabilization to be my friend. the I.S. on this camera is consistently disappointing. my canon, without I.S. takes consistently better images than this fujifilm.3. con: image stabilization (part 2): even when the camera was on auto mode, with decent amount of light, I still got some shaky looking photos. the fujifilm uses a kind of I.S. that is in the sensor, rather than in the lens (the lens kind is more common, it seems). I read that the lens kind of I.S. is better. I took my chances anyway and was not happy with the results.4. con: image details: I shot test photos on auto mode in my living room. on my computer, I zoomed in on one particular painting on my wall and compared the canon and fujifilm photos side by side. the details of the painting were much sharper on the canon every time-- with or without flash.5. small pro: this camera is in fact small, only just a tiny bit bigger than my canon.6. small con: the battery charger is enormous, and has a big bulky cord. not good for travel. it's a small complaint but it bugs me.I'm going to return this camera and keep hunting. maybe I'll have to give up the idea of having a 10x zoom but that's fine by me, as my main priority is good, clear, low light pictures.

Now, it's not a bad camera, but I'm concerning myself here with how it lives up to the expectations and promises surrounding its new Super CCD sensor.The Fuji EXR technology is in its infancy with this camera, and, while I don't find that it delivers nearly as fine, high-contrasty photos as advertised, it's a great technological step forwards.  The science behind it is a great idea (there are plenty of places that describe the Super CCD EXR sensor's photosite layout and processing strategy in more detail than I can here), though I do find it somewhat questionable to advertise a camera as a 10MP camera when the photos taken with its key \"EXR\" features slice the number of actual pixels in half, leaving one with 5MP photos on what is, effectively, a 5MP camera when one uses that key feature.Now, there's nothing wrong with a 5MP camera.  That's plenty of pixels for great snaps.  But this really isn't a great snapping camera in my opinion.  One can essentially set it on the default automatic settings for the EXR or other modes, but the results are inconsistent.The camera lens lacks a gyro for image stabilization, so it likes to bump up ISO, ridiculously so sometimes, to ensure a sharp image.  On the automatic settings, it's not uncommon for the camera to flash and set ISO to 400 or 800 in full sun.  That's just ridiculous.  Digital Noise easily becomes a significant issue, and I have not found that this sensor is any less noisy at high ISOs than other point 'n shoots.And that's really why this camera spends its time on a shelf -- to me, it's not really a point 'n shoot.  As others have correctly indicated, with a lot of manual configuration, one can get some very fine shots.  But, who, honestly, is going to buy this camera planning to override all default and auto settings to milk every last drop of IQ one can get out of the camera?  A little camera like this is going to be chosen, first and foremost, as a point 'n shoot.  And, I just don't see that the pictures out of it are remarkably better than what I can get out of my other two like-sized cameras, and if I want really contrasty photos, I'm going to pull out my D-SLR anyway.  For my personal use, there's just no real appropriate, convenient, or niche use for this camera, and that's why it stays on my shelf.Rather than buying this model, I'd wait until the just-released Fujifilm FinePix F300EXR 12MP Digital Camera with 15x Wide-Angle Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD becomes more widely available and, even more importantly, more widely reviewed.

It produced  1 MB photos with a minimum of control and memory which translated out to about 24 pictures on the built in flash drive. This was soon replaced by my wonderful Minolta Dimage 7, a DSL predecessor with a CF card slot, a superb Zeiss lens with a 7X optical zoom  and 5MB pictorial output. It was big and heavy and I soon learned that I would need a point and shoot for those occasions I was in need of something to take advantage of a unplanned photo opportunity.Now I have a Nikon D80 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body only) along with two great VR lenses, and I still need a point and shoot for unplanned opportunities. The Fujfilm Finepix F70EXR is my best P & S ever. Basically designed for the masses the camera has a lot of neat features most notably a 10X optical zoom. Optical zooms are not to be confused with digital zooms which are not true zooms but programs which blow up and ultimately degrade photographs. It has shooting modes, the EXR mode being a fully automatic mode, and the M mode allowing manual settings including an ISO setting of 1600 for large images, and 3200 for smaller ones. Shutter speeds are also controllable. These kinds of settings assume some photographers will have more than causal photography knowledge.One setting I particularly like is a setting which produces two images, one flash assisted and the other in natural light. As with most point and shoots these days it has a video setting to capture those opportunities where you have forgotten your camcorder.The electronics include face detection which if you think about it is the natural focus of most viewers. Low light modes are also set automatically to produce maximum results. My camera came with a 4GB HCSD card which will hold nearly one thousand high resolutions images.Digital point and shoots are never going to replace DSL's for professional and serious amateur photographers.

Without a Doubt!  Is it worth the EXTRA NINETY DOLLARS that Amazon is tacking on at the current price of $280?  No way!So cry if you must, you public gouging camera sellers - the truth tellers will always be around to keep the public informed!WHEN the price is once again REASONABLE, I will return to purchase.  But not while the blood thirsty are about.  And NOT in THIS Economy!Go rip someone else off!***Original post: March 18, 2010 ***David Pogue of the NY Times indicated that the price of this camera was $190.00.  I can wait until you bring the price back down to the recommended retail price.Maybe the sellers of the camera are taking advantage of the fact that the camera was given a good review.  Is that any reason to take advantage of the public by raising the price?  I think not...SHAME!", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10-megapixel Super CCD EXR\n10x optical zoom lens; 27mm wide-angle to 270mm telephoto\nEXR Auto Mode detects six different scene types\nDual Stabilization; Face Detection 3.0 and Automatic Red-eye Removal\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Fujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41od3U787RL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002HEWA28"}}
