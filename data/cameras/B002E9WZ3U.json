The viewing screen is difficult to see if there is ANY glare and there is no viewfinder. So if there is glare, you can't see what your photographing. I took nearly 100 pictures on \"auto\" mode and not ONE of them had good exposure.  The color and exposure was poor on every single picture.  My friend had a Sony 5.1 megapixel that took excellent picutres; Far superior to the 8 megapixels photos I had taken (I had my camera set on the 8 mpxl option).  I ended up using all of her photos of our trip to send to my family because they were so much better than the ones I took with this camera.Also you have to be extremely careful about changing the \"mode\" to video/VGA.  The small button that changes the mode is very easy to push by accident just while handling the camera.  I ended up having \"accidental\" video of my feet, which of course also consumed the memory on my SD card.The camera has NO internal memory.  I tried to take test pictures without an SD card.  They were lucky to be 1 megapixel in resolution and I was able to take 2 test photos only.  Again, the test photos had very poor color and exposure but I had attributed that to the fact that the resolution was so poor.Don't be tempted by the hype of this camera.  I promise you can get a far better 5.1 Megapixel from Sony and Kodak for less money.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Save yourself the frustrattion", "Author": "Matthew R. Green", "ReviewID": "R2JMOAGXTM9KGE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "4 months later, it's no longer a camera; it's a paperweight that lights up and makes noises every now and then.  The battery life, even with new batteries, is now about 10 shots.  It also randomly decides to rapidly palette-swap the LCD screen to make it look like you're high on LSD once in a while.  Sure, the image quality was decent, but only while the thing lasted.  Admittedly, for the price, perhaps I shouldn't have expected much, but I shouldn't have to lower my expectations so much that I can't crawl under them anymore.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "So what's worse...?", "Author": "D. OLeary", "ReviewID": "R18WLOAGQES2MP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Is it worse to have spent a bunch of cash on this camera, or to have picked it from a catalog of items as an award for 20 years of service at my company? For 10.1MP, this future landfill resident was my gift for two decades of hard work, and I'm mad as hell. The heartbreaker of it all, it has all the basic necessary features -- simple photo editing/deleting, optical zoom, loads of customizable functions for various photo conditions, video capture, antishake, red-eye reduction, high GB SD capacity, high MP rating -- all I would ever really want for personal and semi-pro shots.None of this matters if it takes lousy pictures.After my test run with my kids outdoors and found the quality on par with my old 3.1MP Canon, I spent an hour downloading and installing the \"Vivitar Experience\" software so I could get to the manual. I troubleshooted and found no help whatsoever. Nor is the Vivitar web site beyond the usual click-through response form (reply forthcoming?). I've had to Photoshop nearly every pic so far to remove the aliasing, bleaching or blue-heavy color palette. (Yes, the LCD screen does does palette-swap during viewing, possibly to distract your eyes from the poor photo quality). The AAA's lasted about two days -- 35 pics, two 3-minute videos, and an export to PC. There is no setting for instant review; you must swap modes to make sure the picture came out, ahem, \"okay.\" Auto-flash must be activated on EACH shot.Maybe in 20 more years I can opt for the then-latest model and get today's picture quality in 2030.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Piece of s@#%t", "Author": "MPawn", "ReviewID": "R16S0CF9H1RL1C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Evidently some genius at Vivitar thought that \"quality\" was an optional component in a camera.Every aspect of this gizmo is sub-par, from the materials used to create it to the interface.Thankfully I was given this as a gift.  I only tried it out because my 2 main cameras broke (tough month) and I thought it could serve as a back-up while I got one of them repaired.I will have no remorse what-so-ever trying to sell it at a pawn shop.  I just hope that there's not a sucker out there who'll actually buy the thing.My memory will preserve the images better than this ever will.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "A truly terrible camera", "Author": "S.
