I already own the  D5000 ( Which can't even match up and I though I loved it when I first got it 3 yrs ago.)and the D5100 ( which I still love ) and wanted the D3200. I am a professional photographer and its going to bring even more smiles. The pictures are so crisp. Its small but packed with power. Video very clear. Good sound too. I can't wait for my next shoot.If you want to get brilliant pictures and get your creative juices flowing, this WILL do it. I have no hesitation to recommend this buy. Even the bag in the package is great. I love the lenses. I was able to capture a humming bird in my garden up close from 20 ft away.I am going to have fun with this new baby.Sarah", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera OK", "Author": "Jesus Martinez", "ReviewID": "RL11QK1HA801J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has a great performance and take wonderful pics.

I have just tried it twice or thrice (outdoors and indoors) in last 10 days and the photos are amazing. I guess its a good choice if you are a beginner and struggling to decide what to buy. Even the camera bag and everything else is of standard quality. Haven't opened the tripod yet. Good buy, go for it.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Nice consumer camer with great resoltuion.", "Author": "JQ \"Backpacker\"", "ReviewID": "R359LB8K2ZPKQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this DSLR.  I am used to a more manual 35 mm camera, but after to figure out some ot the trick in how to use the manual settings, you really have some great control.It has great resolution so you can make big enlargements.Even in automatic mode, I was able to get some great shots on a recently Alaskan cruise.The special adapters for telephoto and wide angle are not that good, so I rarely use them.  I really bought this package to get the camera, lenses (especially the 55-300 MM) and camera case.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent deal", "Author": "Juan", "ReviewID": "R2RGMDDVR69CTE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excelent combo for an Entry level DSLR camera.

Not one to buy much online so I did my research; so I am pleased to say if you are looking for a light but powerful camera with a great kit to start you off, put this one in your cart. I have tested out all the accessories and would like to give them a good review as well. The 300mm lens is worth it, even comes with a hood (not listed). Much more solid than the 200mm in my opinion. To put to ease any one wondering about the adapters for the macro and fisheye lenses, just look in the box a little harder... they are in there. The camera, lenses, and everything else were in their factory fresh unopened boxes. Shipping was also quite fast, even with the Monday being a holiday.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "This take of of all your video needs", "Author": "ET", "ReviewID": "R15JOWDXWDFQP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Christmas gift and was informed by the person receiving that it took care of all her video needs.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$789.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) + <2> Nikon 55-300mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Transcend 16GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case + <5> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <6> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter +\n<7> PD 2.5x Tele & .45x Wide Lens + <8> Precision Design 57\" Tripod + <9> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader +\n<10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) + 55-300mm VR Lens + 16GB Card + Case + Filters + Tripod + Telephoto & Wide-Angle Lens Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517ea2swxyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007X47SZG"}}
