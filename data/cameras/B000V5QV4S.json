The first is a brief summary of how I feel about the camera. The second is a detailed comparison of the 30D and 40D based on my experiences with both cameras. After reading this section you will see why I gave this camera a 5 star rating. I loved my 30D but the 40D simply blows it away.Update: 1/6/2008I have added a third section to discuss general guidelines for determining if this is the right camera for you.Update: 2/2/2008In this section I discuss my thoughts about how the new Canon Rebel XSi might impact your buy/upgrade decision.SUMMARY:In less than a couple of months I have gone from a S3 to a S5 to a 30D and I just got my 40D earlier on today. Wow! What a fantastic camera! The pictures that this camera takes are just amazing. I thought it could not get any better than the 30D but Canon has really taken it a notch or two up with the 40D. I want anyone considering buying this camera to know to get it right away. Trust me. It is worth every penny.DETAILED REVIEW OF THE CANON EOS 40D:-The OutsideThe first thing that stood out is the larger, 3 inch, LCD screen. This makes reading the menus and changing settings a lot easier. Canon did not stop there. When I used the 30D I really wished reading the LCD screen was a lot easier when I was shooting outdoors in bright sunlight. When I did a shot I would sometimes have to quickly find a shaded area to view the screen. I am happy to say that Canon did address this issue as well. It is now a lot easier to read the screen in bright sunlight.There are 2 new buttons on the outside that you can use to quickly access settings rather than wasting time going through the menu.- InfoThis allows you to quickly review your shooting information for an image - ISO speed, Picture Style and Metering Mode etc. There are two things that I really like here:1. Highlight AlertsWhen this feature is enabled, if there any overexposed areas in the image they will blink when the shooting information is displayed.2. AF Point DisplayWhen this feature is enabled, you will see the AF point(s) that achieved focus displayed in red.There is another use of the Info button that I really like. It can be used to set the shooting information right there on the LCD screen. I prefer this option of setting shooting information as the names of the various icons are also displayed along with the icons. I remember when I just started using my 30D that I would sometimes forget which icon was for Tungsten Light vs. White Fluorescent Light when I was setting the White Balance using the control panel. Now the name of each icon is clearly displayed as I scroll through them on the LCD screen.- Picture StyleI really love this feature. There are times when I make a standard shot and then need to make a landscape shot. Then I would need to switch back to a standard shot. I can now do this really quickly without having to wade through the menu.There is a new Auto Focus (AF-ON) button. Assuming that you hold the camera in a conventional way, this new button will be just below your thumb. It allows you to auto focus independently of pressing the shutter button. I found this feature really useful when making continuous shots of a trainer riding on the belly of Lolita the killer whale at Miami Seaquarium. I was able to maintain continuous focus right throughout the shots.There are 3 new positions on the mode dial - C1, C2 and C3. You can register most of the current camera settings under them. Believe it or not but this includes not just the current shooting mode but even the menus and custom function settings. I cannot express enough what a time saver these new positions are to me. I find that I have to do different types of shots frequently so with my 30D I had to really change settings frequently. I can now save 3 of the settings that I use most often and have instant access to them. I also like the fact that I still have the option of making changes even after selecting one of these positions. For example, if my C1 was saved with an ISO speed of 400 I am not restricted to that ISO when I select C1. If I find that I only need an ISO speed of 320 I can make that change just as normal.One feature that has been removed is the ability to use the Delete button to delete all images. I really liked this feature as there were times I wanted to delete all the images and it was more convenient to use the Delete button rather than having to go through the menu. However, I think it might have been removed because it was rather easy for someone to inadvertently erase all the images when they really wanted to erase the currently selected image.- Start Up and Power OffWhen you turn the camera on or off you can't help noticing the \"Sensor Cleaning\" message. This was one feature that I really eagerly anticipated. Buying a camera at this price plus quality lens represents a substantial investment. It is really reassuring to know that the camera has dust reduction built into it. What I like further is the fact that if I need to do a quick shot at start up, as soon as I press the shutter button half way to focus, the self cleaning operation is suspended. I also have the ability to turn this option off for start up and power off and run it manually whenever I feel like. I also have the added comfort of knowing that if the self cleaning sensor unit does not get rid of all the dust, I can always append the Dust Delete Data to images and then use Digital Photo Professional (one of the provided software) to remove the dust spots. At first I was a little concerned about the impact on file sizes as a result of appending the dust delete data. It is important to understand that once the dust delete data is obtained it is attached to every image that is captured after that so I was really concerned about the impact of increased file sizes. However, it turns out that this data is so small that its impact on file sizes is really negligible.- ShootingWhen I first put my eye to the optical viewfinder I could immediately see the benefit of Canon increasing the magnification from 0.90x to 0.95x - images are much clearer and brighter and of course, it is also easier to read the various settings. Another welcome change is the displaying of ISO right there in the viewfinder. I really love this. I never liked having to move from the viewfinder to the control panel just to see what the ISO was. Another small change in the viewfinder is the displaying of a warning (B/W icon) when you are shooting in black and white.This camera focuses really fast and accurately. At the Miami Seaquarium I had to do several quick shots of dolphins doing jumps. The problem here is that you never quite know from which direction they will be starting. Despite this I never missed a shot. The 40D has the same nine focus points as the 30D. The increase in speed and accuracy is as a result of the points on the 40D being cross-type. This means that they are sensitive to both horizontal and vertical detail when shooting with lenses of F5.6 or faster. In addition, if you are using a lens of F2.8 or faster the center point is twice as sensitive as any other point.If you want to increase the focusing speed and accuracy even more you can take advantage of the two optional interchangeable focusing screens for the 40D - the Precision Matte with Grid (Ef-D) and Super Precision Matte (Ef-S). The first optional screen is pretty much the standard included screen, with a grid that makes it easier to align vertical or horizontal lines when you are composing the image. The second screen is optimized for f/2.8 and faster lenses and makes it easier to focus manually with these lenses. However, if you are using a lens that is not f/2.8 or faster the viewfinder will look darker than with the standard screen.Something that really stood out with the very first shot from this camera was the shorter blackout time and the quieter, more professional, shutter release sound.  The 30D used a spring to lift the mirror while the 40D uses a motor in both directions which means that the mirror mechanism is both quicker and quieter.At first I did not think much of the increase from 5 to 6.5fps for continuous shooting. However, when you couple this with the fact that the buffer can now hold twice the images that the 30D did you get some amazing results when doing continuous shooting. I have several action shots from the Miami Seaquarium with trainers riding dolphins and the killer whale and with the dolphins and whale pushing up trainers in the air. Trust me - they are awesome. It is fantastic that a non-professional can find a reasonable priced camera that takes such awesome action shots.I am really happy that Canon decided to add Live View Mode shooting. I really liked that mode on the S5 point-and-shoot camera. I never used the optical viewfinder on that camera. I definitely will use the viewfinder most of the times on my 40D but I know there will be situations where it is more convenient to use Live View. Also, sometimes I just don't feel like putting my eye to the viewfinder. Well, I thoroughly tested Live View Mode shooting and, no surprise here, it works just as well as it did on my S5. You can even use auto focus while in Live View Mode. The new AF-ON button can be used for this. You can set just about every shooting function, such as ISO speed and drive mode, while in live view mode. The only thing you cannot change is the metering mode. There are two silent (quiet) modes to go along with Live View. Pay attention to the high temperature warning when shooting in this mode.I have to mention sRaw here. I stayed away from shooting RAW with my 30D because of the file sizes. However, I am now using the new sRAW (small RAW) format and I really like it. A sRAW file is about a quarter the size of a regular RAW file. After applying all the usual post-processing RAW adjustments the resulting image is smaller in size than a regular image. However, this is not a problem for me for the images that I do decide to shoot in sRAW.There are times when I want to take a shot in dim household light and I don't want to use the flash because I want to capture the moment just the way it was. Of course, there are other situations where you are not allowed to use a flash so this issue is also applicable there. The first thing to do is increase the ISO speed. However, in addition you also need to manually set the color temperature for the white balance. The problem with the 30D, however, was that it only allowed a range starting at 2,800K. With this minimum setting you could capture the moment without using the flash but the image would have an annoying orange look. The 40D allows you to set a minimum color temperature of 2,500K. With this new minimum the orange look is gone completely.One of the things that I really disliked about my 30D was that it would instantly power down if I somehow opened the card door while it was still recording images. I am happy to report that Canon has now fixed this problem. Rather than powering down, the 40D displays a warning message that the CF door is opened on the LCD screen. More importantly, it continues to write the images to the CF card without any interruption.- ErgonomicsThis camera feels just right. All the buttons are in the right place. It is not too heavy. It is amazing that despite all the new features Canon has added, the overall dimensions and weight of the camera have not changed significantly.- Transferring Images to a PCI must say that this seems to be a lot quicker than with the 30D. With the 30D it took a while for the transfer utility to launch after I had connected the camera to my PC. However, this part of the process is a lot quicker with the 40D and the actual transfer process itself seems to be somewhat quicker as well.- Custom FunctionsThe new custom function, Highlight Tone Priority, can provide better highlights. However, depending on the ISO speed you are using you might notice more noise than usual in the shadow areas. There is definitely a trade-off involved and Canon has correctly chosen to disable this function by default. So far I have only done shots up to ISO speeds of 800. I did not notice any noise in the shots that I took with this option enabled but I suspect that it will show up at very high ISO speeds.I absolutely love the new My Menu tab. It allows for the registering of up to 6 menus and custom functions that you find that you have to change often. This is another huge time saver even though you have to use the menu. Some of the items that I have to change frequently are the Image Quality, Review Time, White Balance, Auto Play and Live View Function Settings. I now store all of these under the My Menu tab. In addition I have also set this tab to be my default tab so it is shown first whenever the menu is displayed. Something else that I did to save even more time was to sort the items registered under this tab so I can quickly locate them.- Tabbed Menu SystemThe 30D had one long scrolling menu system. The menu was divided into categories with a different color for each category. You could jump from one category to the next. In contrast, the 40D has a tabbed menu system so it is much easier to get to an item when you do need to use the menu. The tabs and their colors generally correspond to the existing categories from the 30D. The shooting and image playback categories each has two tabs. The set-up category actually has three tabs. The custom function category has one tab. The My Menu tab, discussed earlier on, does not have a corresponding category from the 30D. Having multiple tabs for most categories further allow you to save time when searching for an item in a category.- Weatherproof Battery and Storage Compartment DoorsOnce the battery and storage compartment doors are closed, dust and water won't be able to get into the respective compartments. This is a welcome improvement. I wish the entire body was weatherproof but I understand that that would have bumped the price up further.- Direct PrintingI do direct printing using a Canon Selphy Photo Printer. One of the less talked about new feature of the Canon 40D is the ability to trim (crop) an image right there in play back mode when doing direct printing. This is a really convenient feature but it does not end there. When you set the crop rectangle you can also tilt it by +10 or -10 degrees in 0.5 degrees increments. This allows you to correct a slightly tilted image before direct print.- External Flash ManagementThe built-in flash on both the 30D and 40D are good walk-around performers just like the 28-135mm kit lens. However, there are situations where I definitely need a high performance flash so I bought the Canon Speedlite 580EX II Flash to go with my 30D. I could not have been happier with this flash. The only small disappointment that I had was the fact that I could not configure the flash from my 30D. Canon has resolved this issue on the 40D so now I can configure my external flash right there from my camera. Please note that this in-camera configuration of the external flash currently only works with the 580EX II Flash.- MeteringThe metering mode is the way in which the camera determines the correct exposure. The four metering modes from the 30D were carried over to the 40D with one significant change. The modes are as follows:-- EvaluativeThe camera measures the light intensity in several points in the scene. The results are then combined to find the settings for the best exposure. This is the default mode on both the 30D and 40D.-- PartialIn this case the light intensity is taken from an area that represents about 9% of the viewfinder area at the center. I use this when backlighting causes the background to be much brighter than the subject. If evaluative mode was used in this scenario the camera would be fooled by the intensity of the light in the background and the subject would be underexposed. This is remains unchanged from the 30D.-- SpotThe light intensity is taken from an area that represents about 3.8% of the viewfinder area at the center. This has increased from 3.5% on the 30D. I use this when I want the metering to be based on a specific part of a subject or scene such as a face, the eyes or a smile.-- Center-weighted AverageWith this metering mode, the light intensity is weighted at the center and then sort of \"feathered\" out towards the edges. I use this when there are many subjects in the central part of the viewfinder but there are small areas that vary greatly in brightness at the edges of the viewfinder. This is the same on both the 30D and 40D.- Image QualityAt the end of the day I am really interested in the quality of the images that my camera produces. The people viewing my images are really not concerned about the fact that my camera has dust reduction and all the other high tech features. What they are interested in is the final result that they see.I know some people equate more mega pixels with better quality images. However, simply adding more pixels without modifying the sensor to handle the increase properly only degrades noise performance. This time around Canon not only increased the megapixel but also improved the sensor design. These changes, along with the DIGIC III image processor and a 14-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter instead of the 12-bit in the 30D have definitely improved image quality. This was obvious from the very first shot I took with the 40D. However, that was in a well lit area. At the Miami Seaquarium I had to shoot at various ISO levels due to the unstable weather at this time of year. I did shots up to ISO 800 and there was absolutely no noise. Canon must be commended for this. Other companies got caught up in the megapixel war and lost sight of the goal of producing quality images. Something else relating to ISO that I really love is the fact that I can now use auto ISO in the creative modes. I considered it a waste of time having to set this on my 30D.UPDATE: IS THIS THE RIGHT CAMERA FOR YOU? (1/6/2008)This section is really for first time buyers. If you already own a DSLR I am assuming that you know enough to use the specifications of the 40D along with reviews here on Amazon to make your decision.After reading my glowing review of the 40D you might think that I would recommend this camera for everyone - absolutely not. The right camera for you depends on three main factors:- Your Functional Requirements for the CameraYou need to identify the main requirements for the camera. For example, if you will be primarily shooting sports then obviously a camera that only shoots 3fps will generally not be a very good candidate unless you are shooting something like child soccer games. If you intend to shoot more fast paced sports then you will probably want at least 5 fps. If you are more into wildlife photography and will be shooting very fast moving animals in low light then ideally you will need a camera with very good high ISO performance and probably something like 10 fps.Another important consideration is the maximum print size that you expect for your photos. Here is a summary of the maximum print sizes for different megapixels (resolution):6 megapixels  8\" * 10\"8 megapixels  11\" * 14\"10 megapixels  13\" * 19\"As you can see if your maximum print size is 8\" * 10\" then you are covered with even a 6 megapixels camera.Once you have identified the primary use of the camera you can go look at the specifications of the main cameras on the market. Don't get caught up in the Canon vs. Nikon debate. Both companies produce great camera and lenses. Make sure you take the time to first read the specs and then the reviews about each camera. If you come across terms that you don't understand don't be afraid to ask your question right here on Amazon.Lets apply what we have learn here so far. Assume that you are just interested in shooting pictures of your family and you have decided that 8\" * 10\" prints are the maximum that you are concerned about. Based on just functional requirements I would NOT recommend the 40D for you. I would recommend something like the Nikon D40 with 6.1 megapixels for a cost of just $470 which even includes the 18-55mm kit lens. You can even shoot 2.5 fps so you could use it to shoot the kids soccer games. The next two cameras on your list would be the Nikon D40x and the Canon Rebel XTi. Both cameras are 10 megapixels and allow you to shoot 3 fps.- Your BudgetAfter you have identified the ideal camera(s) based on functional requirements you have to take your budget into consideration. For example, based on functional requirements you might decide that the ideal camera would be a ID Mark III. However, if you don't have the $4K+ to buy it you might have to settle for the 40D which is its smaller sibling. You might even decide to go for the Nikon D300 instead. On the other hand, you might have a very generous budget and can afford to buy a more advance camera than just what is needed based on your functional requirements. Based on function requirements you might only need a Nikon D40 but can afford to spend $2000. In that case I would definitely recommend the Canon 40D or the Nikon D300.- Your Personal PreferencesYou have to live with your camera. When you pick it up it should feel comfortable and inspire confidence. Before you buy any camera make sure you go to a store and actually try the camera so you see how it feels. This is totally up to you. What is comfortable and inspiring for one person might not work for another person.As you can see the right camera for you really depend on things that only you can really decide. One of the main questions people ask me is about the Nikon D300. I do not own one so I cannot offer a review here but I have read the reviews here on Amazon and they are all very good. You can use the guidelines above to decide if that is a better camera for you. It offers a lot more features but is also more expensive. Do you need these additional features and can you afford the difference in price? Don't forget that you will need quality lens to get the most out of these expensive cameras. How do you feel about the difference in image quality and high ISO performance between Canon and Nikon? Is this even a concern for you as there are people on both sides that swear that the other one is better? Once again, only you can really answer these questions.Here is my personal account of how I ended up going with Canon and the 40D. I wanted a camera that could shoot fast paced action, portraits and weddings. The wedding requirement meant that I needed a camera that had very good high ISO performance since I would need to make many low light romantic shots without using the flash. There is nothing to spoil a romantic picture like using the flash. I started out looking at the Nikon D80 and the Canon Rebel XTi. I hated the small size of the Rebel XTi. It just never felt good in my hands. I really preferred the Nikon D80. It even had more features such as spot metering that is important in wedding photography. However, when I tested the ISO performance of both cameras it was clear to me that the Canon definitely had superior performance when it came to high ISO. This does not mean that the Nikon was bad - just that the Canon was noticeably better. The official reviews by a prominent testing site had the same conclusions. I also felt that the Rebel XTi had better image quality than the D80, something else that was also confirmed on the testing site.At this point I decided to look at the Canon 30D and the Nikon D200. The D200 cost more but it also offered more features. Both cameras were large enough where I would be comfortable with either one. I went to the closest camera store and tried out the 30D. They did not carry the D200 so I was not able to test it. I was really impressed with 30D but it had a problem since it was only 8 megapixels and I might need to blow up wedding pictures to 13\" * 19\".  I went to a prominent site to see the official tests on both cameras. I was really surprised to find that when it came to image quality and high ISO performance the Canon once again received better scores even though the Nikon had more features. However, since I needed the 10 megapixels I decided to go with the D200. Hey, life is always about some trade-off and I have no problem with a Nikon or a Canon. I almost ordered the D200 when I found out that Canon would be releasing the 40D in a few months so I instead decided to go with the 30D and then upgrade to the 40D when it came out.After four months of using the 40D I have no regrets. I believe it represents the best combination of features and price. However, this is based on my personal functional requirements, budget and preferences. You need to identify your requirements, see which camera fits into your budget and then make sure that you are comfortable with the camera. That is the best camera for you. What is best for me might not be the best for you. Just don't let the fanatics mislead you - both Canon and Nikon produce great camera and lenses.  Pick one and stick with it. Once you have invested heavily in equipment for one there is no reason to be switching to the other. These two companies will always be trying to outdo each other which mean better products for us.3/6/2008: If you are new to DSLRs and would like to get up to speed quickly with the most important concepts you can check out my Website at tajdigistudios for some notes. You will see a menu item titled Photographic Notes. They were added in response to several questions from Jennie. You can also see some of the photos I have taken with the 40D under the Portfolio menu item. The galleries display photos I purchased from iStockPhoto. Over time I will expand the notes to include photos to better demonstrate the concepts. The site is a DotNetNuke application so it is a bit slow when you first launch the application but it should be okay after that. 8/7/2008: I have started putting the photography notes into a free course at this website, tajdslrcourse.UPDATE: THE IMPACT OF THE NEW CANON REBEL XSi (2/2/2008)The replacement for the current Rebel XTi, the Rebel XSi, is scheduled for release on 4/15/2008. If you are in the market for a serious entry level DSLR I strongly recommend that you take a look at this camera. Here is a list of the key new features:- Larger Viewfinder- 12.2 Megapixel CMOS Sensor up from 10 Megapixel- 3.0\" LCD Monitor- Live view Mode including Contrast-detect AF- Spot Metering- Improved 9-point AF System- Redesigned Menu System (including My Menu as seen in the 40D)- Highlight Tone Priority (as seen in the 40D)- Continuous Shooting at 3.5fps up from 3.0fps- 14 bit A/D converter and processing- ISO setting displays in viewfinder and ISO button- Multi-shot Self-timer Mode- Auto Lighting Optimiser (boosts shadows after shooting)- Kit lens: Image stabilized version of Canon's 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lensIt is slightly larger than the camera it replaces. At just $800 for the body and $900 for the kit this is definitely worth serious consideration depending on your requirements, budget and preferences. To be honest with you I think current 40D owners might be a little jealous of the features on this \"baby\" Canon DSLR. In my opinion the competition from Nikon has forced Canon to add more features than it would normally have done. Competition is certainly great for consumers in a free-market. I cannot wait to see what the 5D replacement will be like. I have been waiting on that camera since I plan to use it as my main camera and my 40D as a backup.PURPOSE OF REVIEWS:My understanding was that the purpose of these reviews was for owners to share their experience with the product being reviewed. At the time of updating my review it is really disappointing to see that of 13 reviews, there are actually 5 which are from people who have not purchased the product and are simply rehashing the specs and/or engaging in useless debates about Nikon vs. Canon. This makes it difficult for potential buyers to quickly determine if existing owners are happy with the product and if not, why. I purchased a lot of items from Amazon, mostly books, and I find that I cannot simply rely on the overall ratings anymore. I have to wade through numerous negative reviews from people who do not even own the items. Another problem is the people who buy something that clearly could not satisfy their requirements in the first place. For example, I once saw a review of a book where the reviewer criticized the book for being a beginner's book. The problem, however, is that the book clearly stated that it was for beginners. The title of the book \"Teach Yourself ... in 24 hours\" should have been enough for anyone to know that this book was intended for beginners. Why would someone buy it then and then criticize for being such?I think Amazon need to come up with a way of restricting reviews to people who have actually purchased the item in question from them. This would truly make the reviews more meaningful. In the meantime potential buyers need to carefully evaluate negative reviews. I am not suggesting that all reviews must be 5 stars like the one I gave the 40D. However, I really would like to see the reviews based on the experiences of actual owners. For example, has image quality increased or decreased with the increase in mega pixels and what is the impact when using higher ISO?", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon 40D -- What I like... What I don't like", "Author": "A. Parcher \"aparcher\"", "ReviewID": "RLJP15AVS10HM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a long time owner of the Canon 10D which I quickly outgrew.  Then, I upgraded to the 20D and have been using it for the past few years.  I didn't think the 30D was a big enough step forward to warrant the upgrade.  Going from the 20D to the 40D is a big leap forward.Unboxing the 40D is about the same as the other two DSLRs I've owned.  Manuals in both spanish and english, plus software for MAC and PC.  I got the \"body only\" package as I already own the 28-135mm lens.  That lens is just **ok.** and I really didn't want a 2nd copy.  The battery is the bp511A so I can use the already charged one from my 20D.  The strap is the same as the 20D.  The compact flash memory is the same as well, so I didn't need to buy any new accessories to upgrade.The first thing you will notice is the big display on the back.  It's very nice compared to the one on the 20D.  Although, I'm constantly afraid that my titanium rimmed glasses will scratch the screen.  The screen is so much closer to the viewfinder compared to the little one on my 20D.  I think I'll look for a clear film cover that will shield it.The controls are very similar to the 20D/30D.  However, they are moved around a bit.  The menu structure is very different and it will take some getting used to.  The first thing I thought of was my old 10D... and how simple it was just due to the sheer lack of features.  The 40D has so many that it would be tough for a beginner to get used to them all.  It might be good for beginners who are a bit techno challenged to buy a cheaper, used DSLR to get used to using a simple model... then sell it and upgrade.The camera feels so much more solid than my 20D.  The little motor that pops up the flash sounds really solid compared to the old 20D.  Even the shutter sounds terrific.  Very quick and quiet.  The old 10D had a nice shutter sound as well.  the 20D always sounded like thrashing metal to me.  To contrast, the Nikon DSLRs have a slow sounding swish to them... this one is tight and quick.  The camera feels about the same in my hand.  Although the lines are smoothed out a bit compared to the 20D.I tried out the live preview feature and found it annoying since I'm used to looking through the viewfinder.  I think I would like it much more if this was my first DSLR as a conversion from a point and shoot where you typically only use a \"live view.\"  The LCD is viewable at a strong angle so the live view may be usable for when the camera must be held at odd angles away from the body... like over a stream or something.  This camera is heavier than a point-and-shoot and you need your face to help you hold it steady.  I found myself a bit wobbly when I was holding it out using the live-view feature.  You'll need a high shutter speed to keep from getting shaky looking pictures.So, what about picture quality??  It's a 10mp camera so the pictures are big.  I have a workhorse MacPro tower and it has no problem working on the 10-12MB pictures that this camera produces (.jpg processing for now). I'm happy to say that the focus is spot on in all of my sample pictures from 4 different lenses (17-40 f/4L, 28-135 IS zoom, 50mm f/1.4, 100mm macro).  The DPP software can be used to edit raw files if you choose to use it.  It works pretty well and it was very speedy on my MacPro.  You also get direct access to picture styles from within the computer software so you don't have to worry about setting it in camera.  The pictures look very nice.  The colors are very accurate.  at iso100 the pictures are so nice and smooth.  My 50 and 100mm lenses make the most buttery out of focus areas on this camera.  ******ALERT******as of this writing(9-2-2007), Aperture, Finder, Preview, Photoshop CS3 (ACR4.1), and iPhoto do not support raw image files from the 40D.  This was the case with the 10D when I first purchased it and it took a few months for APPLE and Adobe to deliver updates.  I'm sure Canon are working hard with vendors to get their updates in the works.  The good news is that there are settings for RAW+.jpg so you can have both files when the software updates come through.  If you don't like being on the \"bleeding\" edge of technology, then wait a few months before you plunk down the cash for the 40D.***** ALERT UPDATE *****As of 9-13-07, Adobe has released Camera Raw updated 4.2 which now supports the Canon 40D.As of 10-26-07, Apple's Aperture and Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) support Canon 40D raw files.Picture styles are easily accessed from a dedicated button on the camera.  They allow you to make quick sets for defining different picture taking scenarios.  It basically does some basic post-processing work in-camera to save time later.  It worked really well.  I found that pictures even up at 1600iso looked usable for every day stuff (e.g. not blown up too big.).  ISO can be set in 1/3 stop increments which is new for me. having iso250 just seems weird but it's actually very handy.  Gives you the ability to really tweak the settings to capture as much detail as possible in a high dynamic range image (like a sunset, or a backlit portrait without fill flash).  I haven't taken side-by-side shots yet but it seems like the images are more detailed with a wider dynamic range than the 20D.  Maybe this is the 14bit image processing from DigicIII at work?The camera seems more responsive than the 20D.  The menu scrolling seems faster, file writing seems about as fast (probably a faster rate but bigger file).One of the neatest features is the custom C1, C2, and C3 dial positions.  You can set these up to \"remember\" camera settings for quick access later on.  They act like the memory buttons on luxury car seats!  Very handy if you take really different kinds of shots.  I go back and forth from Macro to Landscape all the time so I can quickly dial in my base set and go from there.The vibration dust remover might be a cool feature.  I can't feel the camera vibrate or hear it working, which is nice.  Apparently it vibrates for 1 second whenever the camera is turned on or off.  I changed this setting so that it's only triggered manually by me.  I figured I could just use it when I need it rather than have it going all the time. .Another of my favorite features is the spot meter.  The 10D and 20D never had this feature.  Apparently the 30D does, but this one is slightly higher weight at the center point.  I tried it out and it works really well in combination with the AF point selectors.So what do I hate about the 40D?  I really hate the Auto White Balance setting for indoor shots.  You want to be sure to set the camera manually when you are taking the 50millionth picture of your dog.  Otherwise it'll be all yellow looking.  Canon, can you fix that please??  If you set it manually it looks great.SInce I like to do available light photography I like to use mirror lock-up.  I wish there was a button for that as do many other people.Canon finally has the iso setting in the viewfinder so we'll give Canon props for that.My last gripe is that the display screen could have a bit higher resolution.  It's nice and big but could have a denser pixel set for really checking out your work.Overall I'm sure anyone would be happy with this camera if you are willing to spend the time to learn how to use it.  If you are a beginner, don't expect to take magazine quality shots on day 1.  Wait at least till day 2 :-)I must say that Nikon did come out swinging this time.  The newly announced D300 is quite the camera.  It will be interesting to compare the Sony CMOS pics to those produced by Canon.  Had I not had a bunch of Canon gear already I might have given up the extra dough for the Nikon.  Nikon (Sony) blues and reds always seem too punchy to me but that's just my personal taste.  My good friend has a Nikon D200 and his pictures are just beautiful out of that camera.  The Nikon D300 has some wiz-bang features but I'm not sure I would take advantage of them... nor do I think they will directly result in better pictures.  Spend the $500 bucks you'll save on a photography class and you'll have more fun, meet more people, and be taking better pictures at 3 months than if you start with a really fancy camera that you can't figure out how to use.I'm hoping Canon has been spending some time re-inventing as Nikon have over the last couple of years.  The good news is that all of these cameras take good pictures; however, you have to know how to use them.  When I pick up my friends Nikon is seems all foreign to me and I feel out of my element.  He makes the same comments when he uses my Canon.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Most Camera For Your Money", "Author": "The Camera Eye \"rfishjr\"", "ReviewID": "RXJF300ZTYXBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon 40D is the most camera for the money that Canon has ever provided. The highlights:- The new improvded Autofocus: Yes, it's still 9 point, and I was skeptical about how improved it would actually be, but having used in the field on several photo shoots, I was able to compare it directly to my Canon 5D, and the AF on the 40D was noticeably more accurate & sensitive to subtle differences within the Depth of Field. The new system performs especially well with my 135mm 2.0L, and my 70-200mm 2.8L IS. But this is what is advertised about it (i.e. better performance with lens w/ Maximum apertures of 2.8 and greater).- The 3.0\" LCD: Once again, comparing this to my 5D, which has a 2.5\" display, the color reproduction is noticeably more accurate. Initially I thought that the colors were being captured differently by the camera, but when I realized they were very similar once I looked at them on the computer, it became apparent the difference was in the display on the camera. Also, the display on the 40D is brighter. I have not yet noticed as dramatic a difference as Canon has made it seem in their product detail when viewed in sunlight, but especially in darker settings, it is noticeable that there's a difference.- The frame rate & buffer size: The increased buffer is very apparent, in particular at the low speed continuous setting (3 fps), where the speed at 3fps seems faster than the 3fps on the 5D simply because it can continue shooting (seemingly endlessly). In the high speed continuous mode (6.5fps), the speed is mind-boggling. I have not had a chance to fully test this out yet (look for a future edit to this).- The viewfinder: The size and brightness are noticeably & dramatically better. The look through the viewfinder is so improved over my old 20D, they almost can't be compared. It's not quite as big as the 5D, but not far off either. And it's just about as bright as the 5D, if not as bright.- The AF button on the back: Although I still use the regular half push on the shutter button the majority of the time, I have found the rear AF button to be very handy at times. At certain times, the way in which I hold the camera makes using the traditional half push much easier. However, as a tip, I have found that in focus-recompose situations, the rear AF button is invaluable, as it is MUCH easier to continue holding down the rear AF Button while recomposing and then snap the shot, whereas with the traditional system, it is more difficult to recompose without accidentally releasing pressure slightly on the shutter and having to try again (or accidentally taking the shot after it refocuses to an area you didn't want).The menu system: The new tab based menu system is much more intuitive & much better than scrolling through one big list. If you've ever seen the menus on some of the more recent Powershot mini point and shoots, it's like that (similar specifically to my knowledge to the SD630, as that is the one I own).Battery management: I used this camera at the Redskins/Dolphins home game last week, and I have a routine of where and how much I take pictures, and how often the camera is on. My camera came in the day I had a photo shoot with a model later, so I put in a battery I had already charged to use with my 5D, and left the brand new battery to charge at home. So, I was using one of my old batteries, in other words. This was not a long photo shoot with this model, I shot maybe 50 pictures of the shoot with the 40D. I never changed the battery before the game & what was noticeable was that the indicator did not drop off of \"full\" until the end of the fourth quarter, right before they went into OT. Since I was shooting with a new 40D as opposed to my old 20D I was shooting more, also - probably 33% more than normal. And with the 20D, if the battery had just been charged and no other use, it would have been down from \"full\" by halftime, slightly beforehand. The camera is clearly managing the power consumption better. (NOTE: The one improvement that did not make the 40D, disappointingly, is a better battery indicator - it's still the same annoying little 3 bars, of which 2 always go away when it drops from full, so really a two bar indicator).- The speed of scrolling through pictures: I know this has to be a result of the DIGIC III processor. It's absurdly better than the 20D or the 5D. If you scroll the knob real quick to zip through a bunch of pcitures, it's there in a second or less. The best way I can describe it is the difference in a computer that you'd been running 256MB RAM on & you just upped it to 1GB. It makes the \"Jump\" button seem almost unneccesary, however, I'm glad that it's still there!- Picture Style Button: This is very convenient. I hated looking for that through the long menu.- Flash management: I don't have the new 580EX II yet, but with the 580EX, it's still noticeable that when using the E-TTL automatic mode, it does a better job of managing the output, using a lower output at times when I know it would have overfired or drawn more power on the 20D, and the end result is you can get more good shots quicker. NOTE: I was using the external power pack also. But I'm making my assessment based on use of the power pack with the flash when using the old camera as well.- Visible ISO on the display on top. And better, although still familiar, layout on the top display.Assessment: In terms of specs, this camera is amazingly close to it's new big brother the 1D Mark III, more than past models have been. This is a big plus to those of us who don't have a fortune to spend on the top of the line Canon cameras. The image quality of this camera is not noticeably different than that in the 5D, although there is a slight difference when you look carefully. And of course it isn't full frame, which is a minus in certain applications, and a plus in others. The improvements between the 20D and the 30D were negligible, to say the least - it was clear Canon was just extending the lifecycle of the 20D, and the 30D should have been called the 20D Mark II. However, the 40D has many dramatic improvements over both of these previous models, and scrapes at the heels of the 5D in all of the areas where the 5D once had a clear advantage - let's hope for a 5D Mark II (or 7D, or whatever it will be called) soon. I've been reading rumors that it will be the 1st quarter of next year. I will admit that when this camera was first announced, and the Nikon D300 announcement came a few days later, Nikon caught my attention big time. But obviously, with all my investment in so much Canon equipment, it was a no-brainer to continue with Canon. Even to own both brands would be a considerable additional investment for that one body, as I have no Nikon lenses. At this point I will preach the gospel of \"L.\" To truly appreciate how good Canon photography can be, you need to own at least one \"L\" lens (although it will become more than one once you do, LOL). I own the highest rated (and still somewhat \"affordable\") L lenses, the Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS Image Stabilizer USM AF Telephoto Lens & Filters & 5 Year Warranty & Accessory Kit(both previously mentioned here), the Canon EF 100-400mm f4.5-5.6L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras and the Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, which I haven't used on the 40D yet, as I prefer the idea of using it on the full frame 5D for the wider angles it provides. I haven't used the 100-400 on it yet just because I haven't had a chance or the right opportunity. They're all worth every penny, and I would note that the 135mm 2.0L might be the best lens, period. It's defintely my best one, although the 70-200 2.8L IS comes close.Once again, the 40D is the best body for the money that Canon makes.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Camera I've Owned Yet!", "Author": "P. McGuire", "ReviewID": "R3CO51YM5MI1H4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I'm no camera pro - very amateur. I moved from my P&S; to a DSLR this summer. My first DSLR was a Canon Rebel XT. While I was happy with the XT, it was too small for my hands. So I plunked down $$$ for this Canon EOS 40D with the 28-135mm IS lens. My review will compare the XT to the 40D (as that's all the DSLR experience I've had).I did not purchase this Canon EOS 40D from Amazon - that is why I've had this Camera since late August.First off, the 40D is the perfect size for my hands. The Rebel XT would leave my pinky hanging cramping my hands after a few shots. The Canon EOS 40D is perfect in terms of hand comfort. All my fingers fit on the grip making the camera feel very solid. The 40D's build quality feels a lot better than the XT.I noticed that my Rebel XT's autofocus would search a lot over and over. This was extremely annoying especially while trying to take moving pictures. I can tell that the 40D's autofocus is a bit faster and quite a bit more accurate in those situations.Be aware that the 40D weighs quite a bit more than the Rebel XT. I am still getting used to the weight. However, I am noticing that the heavier 40D is a lot easier to hold resulting in a clear shot than the Rebel XT (at least for me).The viewfinder is quite a bit bigger than the Rebel XT. I also noticed that it has a \"tint\" look and takes some getting used to. The viewfinder is a bit brighter than the XT as well.As far as the lens goes: I had a 28-105mm (nonIS) on my Rebel XT. The 28-135mm is awesome. It zooms further than I've ever needed it to. What I like the most is that it has a nice macro range (better than my 28-105mm lens). The autofocus is extremely fast. I'm sure the Image Stabilizer has saved many of my pictures...At Large Fine picture sizes average around 4.5MB per shot. So be ready to have a large storage device handy nearby (I use my 500GB external drive).All in all - I will and have recommended the Canon EOS 40D as a good DSLR for the photography enthusiasts such as myself. I will be keeping this camera for many years. After all, the camera doesn't produce pro shots - the photographer does.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great camera - with room for improvement", "Author": "Black Belt Systems \"fyngyrz\"", "ReviewID": "R31V2BHFOWJDJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll start off by saying that yes, this really *is* a great camera. I bought it as body only, then added a Canon EF 100 f2.8 Macro USM lens. If you're not familiar with that lens, it is fairly heavy, and so the camera has felt heavy to me since day one. But it is the lens creating that impression.The 40D starts up, shoots, and shuts down quickly; With the right lenses, it creates clear and consistent photographs; it is hugely flexible, pretty much to any degree you want to flex. Some of the things that have made themselves known to me by how well they work are, in no particular order, the great battery life... I use the LCD a lot, shoot a lot, and generally fuss continuously with the camera, and it just \"keeps on going\" which is enormously pleasing (this is with the stock battery and a BP-511A spare pack to swap in.) The feel of the camera - just a nice handful of goodness, it really suits my hands, which are large. The clarity of the viewfinder. I wear glasses, and after a little playing with the adjustment, it was *perfect*, first time ever with any camera. This thing is *fast*; it really can do 6 or so frames a second (depends on the shutter speed, of course) and the AF is also fast which makes for more images, and more good images. I love all the preset modes, and I've already had some fun in manual and a *lot* of fun in aperture priority, which pretty much suits the way I think. I particularly like the AF display and the way you can control it; I prefer a single central AF point so I can control focus at the half-press point, and the camera was perfectly agreeable to that. More points did some interesting things with depth of field, and I look forward to experimenting with that, too.I would buy this camera body again in a heartbeat if something horrible happened to mine, like I dropped it down a well or larval (and soon to be deceased) human beings got hold of it and used it as a kickball. It also offers some optional features like wifi that sound like great fun, though I confess I can't speak to them as I've not tried them.There are some things I think could have been done better, though, and since you're probably looking at the camera wondering what the downsides are, rather than looking for what made everyone happy, that's what I'm going to focus on.o The worst problem, by far: The images that the camera uses to let you review your shots are FAR softer than the actual photos, to the point where you can't really tell if you got the focus nailed, or not. This is not a nitpick - this causes me to take extra shots because I literally can't tell if I've hit the mark, or not. I am hoping this can be fixed with a firmware update to the camera.o That fabulous LCD, huge and bright and crisp, looks awful every time I look at it after shooting through the TTL viewfinder. This is because it has a huge NOSEPRINT on it. Has anyone at Canon ever taken a look at a human face? Placement of the monitor should be offsides and inset so that it isn't a grease magnet. Or do they expect me to wash my nose every time I snap a picture out in the field?o While I'm harping on the camera's ergonomics, the power switch isn't very easy to manage. I have very short nails (I'm a guitarist and a martial artist, neither of which encourage nail growth) and getting that switch to swing on and off sometimes takes more than one try; that may, someday, lose me a photo I really wanted, especially considering how fast the camera starts up otherwise. I really wish it had a deeper pit for my finger and a more positive tractive surface to drag it on. It's too short and too smooth.o When in Live View mode, meaning, you're presumably shooting using the LCD instead of the viewfinder (after cleaning your latest noseprints off of it, of course), autofocus doesn't work. But wait, it does. *If* you press a different button. Apparently the power budget of the camera is pushed a little too close to the edge if you use live view *and* autofocus because the mirror is locked in the up position. So they... moved AF to another button? Look, either let me do it, or don't let me do it, but quit changing what the controls do underneath my fingers. That's just poor interface design. Maybe you should have turned it off by default, then let us blatant power-spenders turn it back on, kind of like how ISO 3200 works on this camera (it's a menu option, not initially enabled. Requires RTFM or at least someone telling you what to do.) Anyway, I don't like how this works. At all. But it's a nitpick.o When you're not in live view mode, the camera will display your shot in the LCD for 2 seconds, then blank (this time is adjustable, somewhat, in the menus. But 2 seconds is the shortest time for it to work at all.) You have to wait for the preview to go away (2 seconds) to enter play mode so you can really take a look at it. I think it should directly enter play when it is in that 2-second \"grace\" period after the shot; the fact that it doesn't costs me time, at least in some situations. And time, in photography, can mean lost shots.o Print button - come on. I can think of a hundred things that would be more important to put on a button than \"print.\" That's just... silly.o I would have liked to have infrared remote firing of the camera. This is MUCH more flexible than the 2s or 10s delayed firing option it has now. You can go out and sit with a group and putter around indefinitely with infrared; even 10 seconds isn't a lot of time to get out there, regulate your breathing, meld into the group photo, and stop staring down your 3rd cousin Hotisha's bodice. Uh, not that I would do such a thing. No. Not me. Cough.o It isn't easy (meaning, you have to use a deep menu) to clean out all the images on the CF card. Should have been, really. it *is* easy to delete images one at a time.o The weather flap on the USB connection (and external fire, strobe, and video connectors) are a little difficult to grasp (I have essentially no nails, remember), and they really are just rubber flaps - I fully expect them to wear out, as they don't have proper hinges or otherwise use reasonable bearing surfaces. I *really* don't like having to struggle with the flap every time I want to grab pictures from the camera, which is several times a day on days when I'm *not* seriously shooting. I might *have* to buy that wifi accessory...These are, in the end, mostly problems I would characterize as \"nitpicks\", and with the exception of the soft review images, certainly nothing to get in a frenzy over (well, maybe the placement of the LCD screen too... but that certainly isn't a problem only found in Canon products.) This is a fabulous camera; I can't imagine anyone actually regretting buying one unless they've been working with far, far more expensive gear than this. I gave it five stars, and that's just how I feel about it.About me: I've been into photography since about 1965, my last camera was an Olympus E20, a 5 MP camera with an *excellent* all-occasion lens, macro to telephoto, and an insatiable appetite for batteries. Moving up to a 40D was a great experience for me. I'm not a pro, maybe semi-pro is fair, my experience with cameras includes both BW and color developing, all manner of large format boxes, several 35 mm cameras, and ten or eleven digital cameras from the 320x240 dawn of digital cameras to today. I am also an engineer (EE) and the author of a very extensive image processing software suite and several RAW processing plugins; consequently I am intimately familiar with how digital cameras actually work.", "Date": "October 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "The 40D is a great camera", "Author": "Ruth E.

I have the 5D and just sold my 30D after a few days with the new 40D.

Outdoor shots are beautiful, as are properly exposed indoor shots. Overexposed shots indoors have a ulgy yellow cast to them, I had to learn the camera.I really love the menu system on the 40D, it's so much easier & quicker then what's on the my 5D, it felt comfortable right away.The AF-ON button for tracking action shots is wonderful, and worth the money for the camera by itself.The image quality on the 40D is excellent, IMHO better then the 30D which is why I sold mine right away.I wanted a better camera for fast action that had picture quality like the 5D. The 40D is pretty close, nothing quite equals the 5D images ( I don't have the Mark 111 ). As far as comparing it to Nikon's D300 coming out, I just sold all my Nikon gear to switch to Canon low noise images. Now Nikon addresses the noise issue by coming out with the D300, for me it's too late.

I think I'd bust a gasket in my head if I read one more review.After such a long wait, finally getting my hands on the thing was quite a shock. It feels so alien to me. But you'll be pleased to know it feels very good. Nice and solid. The sound the shutter makes is much nicer than my old XT. And the there is a noticeably larger view through the viewfinder. Still nothing as grand as my old seventies SLR, but a definite improvement. These are the things that are most important to me. If my experience taking pictures is more pleasurable, then I'll take more pictures. That's the way I am and I guess you probably are too.The next most important thing for me is having the ISO setting visible all the time. You can easily adjust it without removing your eye from the viewfinder. This is such a luxury, it really is. I have shot at the wrong ISO so many times in the past it's not funny.I love having the two dials too, which is what I suppose makes this a \"semi-professional\" camera. It's funny how the more you pay the easier everything is to use. You'd think \"pro\" equipment would be trickier, but that's not how it works at all. I remember trying to find the exposure settings buried deep in my old point and shoot and feeling like throwing it against the wall. No such issues with this.The only letdown is the LCD. I had read it wasn't very high-res and that is blatantly clear. If you have bad eyes and look at it from a distance, it is great, but if your eyes are good and you want to see detail, you have to zoom. It just doesn't look very nice. In a way I preferred the smaller LCD. That was like seeing a little negative before seeing a print.

Hoagland", "ReviewID": "R39EDLRSBXAVHC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the Canon EOS 40D on 9/26/07. From the time I took it out of the box and held it, I knew I was going to like this camera.Ergonomics:  I've been using a smallish Rebel XT for almost a year, so the larger size and grip of the 40D was a delight. And the 40D is nice and grippy in all the right places. And all the controls fall readily to your fingertips--very ergonomic.Build quality:  It has some heft to it, which lends a sense of sturdiness and quality. Also, the extra weight provides a better balance for my EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS USM lens. My Rebel XT, when I had the strap around my neck with the camera hanging down in front, would tend to twist forward under the weight of the lens. With the same lens mounted to the 40D, the camera tends to stay straight--much better balance.Viewfinder:  The viewfinder is another thing that Rebel XT owners will smile about regarding the 40D. The viewfinder is much larger and brighter than the Rebel XT's.Top LCD:  The top LCD display has lots of helpful information that remains displayed at all times (f/stop in Av mode, white balance setting, est. remaining shots on card, battery indicator, metering mode, auto focus mode, exposure scale, ISO, and shooting mode (single shot, 3 fps, 6.5 fps, or timer)). I look at the remaining shots indication all the time.Rear LCD:  The rear LCD is huge (3-inches). And the lettering is large, bright and easy to read--much better for those of us who have difficulty seeing small writing close up. I find that it can be read even if you turn the camera almost all the way sideways to your face.  Therefore, the 140 degrees viewing angle rating appears to be quite conservative.  The menu options are well-organized, intuitive, and easy to navigate and use.  You can set the amount of time the image displays on the rear LCD after you take the shot (Review time = Off, 2 sec., 4 sec., 8 sec., or Hold). I did notice that, despite how very bright this display is, in bright sunlight, it is nearly impossible to see the image in the display.  So, I just had to look for some shade (or shield the display from the sun somehow).Taking Pictures:  The 40D lends so much confidence, it is almost impossible to adequately describe. Especially with the excellent EF-S 17-55 lens, there seems to be no shooting situation you can't conquer. The Auto Focus (AF) locks on fast and sure with a quick \"beep-beep\" in all lighting situations. I generally have the camera set to just the center AF point, since I want to choose the specific spot I want to focus on.  The 40D has a high-precision cross-type center AF point that, when used with an f/2.8 or larger lens, provides twice the sensitivity as the other AF points.  Lately I've been utilizing the 40D's Highlight tone priority mode and the High ISO speed noise reduction mode.  The Highlight tone priority mode expands the dynamic range from gray to bright highlights and the gradations in between become smoother.  This mode forces the minimum ISO to be 200.  This is no problem, since the 40D produces very low noise, even at elevated ISO speeds.  I have noticed that detail in highlights is well-preserved, though I still frequently need to reduce the highlights in post-processing (I shoot RAW almost exclusively). The High ISO speed noise reduction mode applies noise reduction at all ISO speeds, which is particularly effective at high ISO speeds. This mode also reduces noise in shadows.  I am having no problems with noise on this camera.  And despite this in-camera post-processing, in Photoshop Elements, I still can level, saturate, sharpen, etc. to my heart's content and still wind up with a sharp image, due to the excellent 10.1 megapixel sensor, and the inherently low amount of noise it produces.Live View:  I briefly played around with the Live View mode hand-held, since I have yet to receive my new ball head I've ordered for the tripod legs I recently received. It is really convenient to move the little joy-stick on the back of the 40D to place the little box over the point of interest and zoom in 5x or 10x and manually focus to fine-adjust the focus.  You can auto focus during live mode by holding down the AF On button until you hear the quick \"beep-beep\" of the AF locking on (rear screen goes blank), then release it and the Live View display comes back on immediately. When you press the shutter release in Live View mode, it is nearly silent, since the mirror is already locked up and out of the way. [Note that you initiate Live View mode by pressing the \"set\" button in the middle of the big wheel on the back of the 40D and the mirror locks up and out of the way immediately, and you get a nearly full-screen, live view on the large rear LCD with info underneath showing (in Av mode) f/stop, exposure scale, shots remaining on card, and ISO speed.]General observations:  The battery seems to be lasting a long time, despite me playing around with the Live View mode, and spending a lot of time going through menu items and deciding which modes I want to use.  As of this writing, I've taken about 200 photos (some of which are posted here for you to see). I got the 8GB Sandisk Extreme IV Compact Flash card, so I can just walk around popping off shots without worry of running out of space.  I have received a Bogen-Manfrotto 055mf3 tripod, but I am waiting on the Kirk BH-1 ball head to arrive. Then, I will give the Live View mode a thorough going over.Conclusions (9/29/07):  This camera simply does all that is asked of it. There is no better camera that can be used with the top-performing Canon EF-S 17-55 lens, since the 40D is the best 1.6x crop Canon camera body, and the EF-S 17-55 lens can only be used on 1.6x crop Canons. The 40D is ergonomic, sturdy, feature-packed, high performance, high IQ, low noise, and an exceptional value. I'm sure many pro shooters will be snatching these things up, too. And I'm going to have a ball exploring all that it can do.

My old (300D) friend has served me well over the years with Battery Grip, Eye Piece Extender and a host of affordable Canon lenses that I've used for portrait and general walk-around photography. My review is more subjective that capability based - as it has renewed interest in portions of my hobby I've not experienced since the 35mm film days. This purchase has supercharged my excitement in digital photography like nothing since my first hands on with the 300D.In looking for another camera body and lens combination - I considered the XT/XTi series but my attention quickly turned to the newest 40D. I'm a serious semi-pro (do extensive portrait work for formal charity fund raising events) and wanted to upgrade to a second camera body and give my charities the finest portrait work I could afford.The 40D had enough features (many still being practiced from the manual-highly recommended) that allowed me to invest in this next generation camera body. I ordered the camera with the BG-E2 battery grip - Eyepiece Extender with a diaptor insert to compensate for my eyeglasses) side hand strap (which I absolutely LOVE) and the 28-135mm 'kit' lens to compliment my 'portrait posse' 50mm f1.8 and prime 85mm f1.8 that I also absolutely love - tack sharp and bokeh to die for (jmho)...The body of the 40D is solid as a rock - the kevlar/plastic 300D never gave me problems - but... this inspires more 'confidence' to last a longer time (more camera - less expendable computer feel). The fps for action shots is outstanding - on a 4 gig CF memory card (SanDisk Extreme II) is adequate for my needs and pocketbook).Added to this was an upgrade from my 420EX TTL speedlight with a newer 580EXII ETTL which is giving me BEAUTIFUL indoor high ceilinged shots (using a flash diffuser) with no blowouts to date and great exposures over a variety of indoor situations. The 420EX is now a wonderful slave unit to the 580EXII.I'm now shooting RAW instead of JPEG for the majority of my shots and the difference is noticable. Better able to tweek these RAW images in photoshop also.If I'm sounding like a kid with a new toy - well - yes! This rig and upgraded accessoriues has breathed a little excitement into this digital photographer. The 3\" LCD, Liveshot capabilities and IS 28-135 lens has given me a burst of creativity on the MACRO side not present with other lenses I have owned. A new light tent has renewed my interest in my wristwatch hobby with wonderful macro shots.This camera body exceeds my present digital photo experience - but as I go thru the manual I'm learning so many useful items on focus range, manual exposure techniques, ISO, and speedlight boundaries the 300D never had. It will be about another month or so before I am \"comfortable\" again with my ability to better utilize this camera than my 300D mainstay.This camera is not for everybody - the XT/XTi being a great pro-sumer body for the 'average' recreational photographer (jmho). As I get more serious - I can now concentrate on a series of 'L' lenses to continue my semi-pro hobby. New photographic worlds I could not imagine await me using this camera body. A camera that feels like it will last a lifetiime (until a better technology emerges anyway).", "Date": "September 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Wow affect!", "Author": "Jeffrey Newman", "ReviewID": "R3BQZLACKZ9F19", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I took the first couple of shots with the 40D, myreaction was Wow.The 40D is 80% to 90% of the 5D, The slight change to the control layout is animprovement.

I had a Canon point and shoot from 2005, and got the Rebel XTi (5 stars after 10,000+ snaps of flawless performance) in December 2006. Over the next year and a half, I got several Canon lenses including 2 L lenses. When the 40D came out, it got on my radar, since I wanted something more professional, I was worried about my XTi shutter giving out, and frankly my lenses were supposedly better than my camera.I finally made the plunge and ordered the 40D body in May. The first one was DOA and would not power up. I returned it to Amazon and got a replacement body which functioned fine for 3 weeks. Now it has developed a \"stuck pixel\" (a red dot in the same place on the frame...see various forums).One solution is to clone it out, but since I occasionally do a shoot of several hundred pics and have sold some prints this is not really practical on a large scale. And it does show up on enlargements if it is in the shadows. It looks like someone is using one of those laser pointers on your pic.I have a message in to Canon support on this. I suspect they will want me to ship the body to Irvine and have them deal with it.I suppose I can live without it for a couple of weeks since my XTi is, as I said, working flawlessly, but I really hate shipping precision equipment like this. It is expensive (my shipment back to Amazon on the first one was over $50 with insurance) and the camera takes needless knocks.I hope Canon reads this. My XTi and the Canon lenses have been flawless, and every picture I took that was less than great was my error. But the 40D is now down two strikes.June 21 update: Canon recommended shipping to their service center (and they would provide prepaid shipping labels). Searching on the net I found a procedure for a do it yourself remap. Basically, you run the manual sensor clean procedure for 30 sec or so with a lens on and a cap on the lens. It seems to have worked. So the symptom is a stuck pixel from images about 600 to 900, then it went away, possibly as a result of this procedure.

Forty days after getting it and 10 days before the course, I got the dreaded error 99 message and the camera completely stopped working. I can't return it since it lasted 10 days beyond Amazon's return policy and Canon tells me to send it in to be fixed and the warrany MAY cover all the cost. Even if they fix it I will then have a camera I will not completely trust and will lose the oportunity to use it in the course/workshop for which I will use S3 IS rather than completely lose the nonrefundable $200. I almost bought a Nikon, guess I should have.UPDATED RATING  ONE STARI send my camera in for warranty work after my initial rating. I was told the repair would cost $747 since my warranty was voided by \"moisture\" damage. Since the camera had not been near water, not even rain, I asked how that was possible. They asked me about high humidity or if I had been prespiring. I live in AZ and our humidity had suddenly gone from about 10% to storms overnight, and I may have prespired. I was told digital equipment is sensitive to moisture, and that either could have caused the problem. I can not believe that either could cause problems in a properly built camera. Later after searching the internet I discovered that Canon used this story at least once before to explain moisture damage voiding the warranty on a camera not exposed to liquids. The camera is coming back unrepaired and going to an independent electronics lab where a friend works since he is interested in looking at it but warns canon's opening the camera could have made it hard to spot bad seals. After that it will go in the trash or I'll mount it as a thousand dollar bad memory.

These are only my personal feelings your mileage may vary.Pros:Favorites menu!Auto ISO in all modes1/8000th shutter speed and 3200 ISO at last!Flash using Canon Speedlite 430EX is right on the money!sRaw, save space and small exported JPEG's actually look better!Super fast in all aspects: turn on, operation, auto focus, shootingGreat feel in the hands, fits like a glove, I could shoot all day long!Rear LCD screen, better then my old Canon Rebel XTi but could be sharperRaw files you gotta love, very good noise control, responsive and colors to lust afterAuto White balance that actually works pretty good!High speed 6.5 fps shooting!  I have yet to hit the limiter when shooting high speedWith some Canon lenses (17-55 EF-S F/2.8, 24-70 F/2.8 L, 16-35mm F/2.8 L II, 17-40 F4 L, 85mm F/1.2 II L, 135mm F/2 L, 70-200 F/2.8 L, 70-200 F/4, etc. etc) this camera has built in lens Auto Lens Vignetting correction using peripheral Illumination control see Auto Vignetting comments below:Cons:Power Switch locationRear LCD shooting info has to be turned on each time and no auto-off when brought up to faceRear LCD is not 100% when checking critical focus, some images that looked sharp on the LCD were not back on the computerCamera user settings C1, C2, C3 lose on-the-fly updates when camera goes to sleepNeutered auto ISO range only goes up to 800 ISO.It fits my hand like a glove; I especially love the rubberized coating around the right grip.Where did everything go?  My power switch and screen display.  You better have your owner's manual handy because this is a different camera from the Rebel XTi.WOW this camera shoots fast!  It has a precision to it and speed both in focus and number of shots my Rebel just does not have.  Got to buy more CF cards though as they fill fast shooting in Raw at 6.5 FPS and they are bigger then the old Rebel Raw files.I continue to be impressed with the ability of the Canon 40D Raw images.  Not only are they a leap beyond the XTi Rebel in appearance they respond much better to changes in Adobe Raw.  I especially like how responsive the 3200 ISO shots are to the noise filters.  ISO 3200 once I process it through CS3 Raw noise reduction actually looks like my Rebel looked at 400 ISO!.  And the colors man oh man they are breath taking.Speaking of breath taking!  The rear LCD is amazing.  I haven't had to touch the brightness at all which is good because I have a really good idea if the image came out or not.  Not so on Rebel where I had to run the brightness all the way up on the rear LCD and so could not judge if the exposure was correct not to mention it was hard to see the photo itself.  This 40D screen is huge bright and breathtaking.And I love the favorites menu.  Set your own deeply buried and needed settings right there.  Like mirror lockup!  Or live view!Love the grip that rubber really helps me get a grip!!Now for the now so good.  Who the hell decided to put the on off switch down on the bottom middle?  I swear I have reached over with my right thumb by habit a dozen times to turn the camera on and off.What the heck?  On the C1, C2, C3 settings if you make any adjustments on the fly and then the camera goes to sleep the settings go away.  Will have to make a short cut under favs to adjust the settings on the fly.All in all though I continue to love this camera and after shooting it for a little over a day I picked up the Rebel XTi and it felt like a small unresponsive plastic toy!!!I will continue to update this review as I have more time, right now I'm at about 2,000 photos.Auto Vignetting peripheral illumination control:When shooting using your new 40D Canon has this super sweet Auto Lens Vignetting correction that works with some Canon lenses (17-55 EF-S F/2.8, 24-70 F/2.8 L, 17-40 F4 L, 16-35 F/2.8 L II, 85mm F/1.2 II L, 135mm F/2 L, 70-200 F/2.8 L, 70-200 F/4, etc. etc) both in camera with JPEG's and in RAW using peripheral Illumination control in Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP). No more vignetting when shooting wide open!!!  When shooting Raw open the file(s) in DPP and click on NR/Lens Lens Aberration Correction / Tune and click on Peripheral illumination. The 40D has already picked up the amount of vignetting based on focusing distance, zoom setting used and F stop from the lens and has saved the information with the Raw file. You can just click on Peripheral illumination and use the suggested amount or you can adjust the amount using the slider if you don't like the amount automatically suggested. If you shot JPEG then you get the auto amount. SWEET!!!3-11-2008 UpdateWent out with the Canon 70-200 F/2.8 L lens on servo mode high speed 6.5 fps setting and had a blast.  I tracked cars, planes, birds in flight, this baby just locks on and keeps tracking.  My Rebel would maybe get one or two in focus frames of a bird in flight that was it.  This 40D I can get 10 to 20 all in razor sharp focus before the bird is out of view.  I'm practicing on pigeons around the house so they aren't in view for long.  Can hardly wait to try it out on some bigger birds as it would be a cakewalk.3-13-2008 UpdateFlash using Canon Speedlite 430EX is right on the money!  Let's face it, there are times you just have to use flash.  And with my old Canon Rebel XTi it was a chore.  The Rebel's flash metering was almost always off and inconsistent.  What a pleasure to find the flash exposures with the Speedlite 430EX mounted on my Canon 40D to be nailed right on the money every time.The 40D continues to delight!3-25-2008Used the 40D at a wedding this weekend and WOW.  This camera is a leap beyond the Rebel XTi.  The auto white balance actually works pretty good at least with florescent lights.  And the few times I had to use flash it was pretty close to a perfect exposure.  The color depth when using raw is just incredible I am selling my old film cameras.  The client actually  liked my tweaked 40D photos much better then the film ones I shot using ULTRA COLOR 100 Kodak Film.4-7-2008 Focus test update.  As a test of auto focus power I tried the Canon 85mm F/1.2 L II Lens (this lens will push your auto focus to the limit even with the USM) with the Canon Rebel XTi and Canon 40D back to back. Talk about over taxing the system! I thought this lens was slow to focus on the 40D. The 40D will focus from minimum distance to infinity in a second or so with this lens (all other USM lens faster then I can even time or think). The Rebel takes what seems like an eternity to focus through the limits with the 85mm F/1.2 L II or well over 2 seconds. The funny part is how unbalanced this combo feels the Rebel XTi is this little camera body hanging off the back of the lens. Still in the end the Rebel does focus and you can use it even though you have less shots in focus then with the 40D.  Even so I'm thinking most people that can afford this lens will be buying at least a 40D or higher.5-11-2008 UpdateOn a client shoot late yesterday I was reminded just how important the large 3 inch color LCD viewing screen on the back of the 40D is.  Time after time I would show the client photos on it taken with the 40D and Canon 85mm F/1.2 L II lens and they would just drool.  The people along with them were asking for business cards and setting up additional photo shoots.  I am a pro photographer I make 100% of my money from photography so selling additional clients is extremely important.5-20-2008 UpdateUnder $1000 now for a brand new in the box with warranty Canon 40D!  Common on you shouldn't even be reading this far, you should have already ordered this has to be the bargain of the year.At a wedding this weekend I traded out my 40D for my daughters Rebel XTi (my old camera) to take some wider angle shots with the 17mm as I had the 85mm F/1.2 L II  mounted and just wanted to get some quick shots.  Man was I spoiled, you take a shot with the 40D you instantly see the play back.  Now the Rebel XTi seems: Very light and small, slow, slow to respond, slow to play back, viewfinder is narrow and dark and fuzzy.  That makes the 40D a little heavier, faster, fast to respond fast to play back and the viewfinder is wide, bright and sharp by comparison.Update 8-22-2008Continue to love this camera!  It just continues to rock!!  And now the difference between my Rebel XTi and 40D are far more appartent even then when I first got it.  It's hard to go back to a Rebel after shooting a 40D at 6.5 Frames Per Second!!Just a quick note of how much better photos are from this camera when shooting raw if you use Canon's Digital Photo Professional (DPP)that came free with the camera.  A friend of mine recommended I try it and I did a back to back comparison between processing RAW to JPEG using Adobe Photoshop CS3's Adobe Raw and Canon Digital Photo Professional.  There is no comparison!!!  The DPP photos are much clearer and sharper and have better contrast and resolution!!!  The DPP software is a little more crude in the menu dept and feature dept then Adobe Raw.  But the results are worth it.  I challenge you, take some shots with your 40D in RAW and process them using DPP and compare to whatever else you are using.  You will be shocked!!!10-03-2008 Update:I read a review of the new sRaw format and they suggested using it for low light shots especially when you just want to save the file as a low 72 dpi JPEG for use on the web anyway.  Much to my shock after a lot of comparison photos using a tripod, live view, manual focusing, and manual shutter and F-stop to eliminate variables they are absolutely right!sRaw format high ISO (1600 and 3200 iso) photos exported as small 17inch 72dpi JPEG photos look sharper and have less noise then photos taken with the full Raw format!!!As a bonus when shooting sRaw the file size is half as big only 8mb vs 16mb on average so you can get a lot more shots on your card.01-03-2009 Update:I just bought a new Canon 5D Mark II.  I don't use my Canon 40D much anymore.  Mainly when I need the faster frame rate for birds or as a backup camera at weddings.  The 5D Mark II is that much better!1-20-2009 Update:The way the Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L Lens eats batteries when on my Canon 40D may be a software glitch.  I got notice that firmware update Version 1.1.1 for the Canon 40D fixes a malfunction that in rare occurrence causes a low battery indication to be displayed when using the EF 85mm F1.2L II USM lens. Depending on the battery check timing of the camera, the battery level displayed on the camera's LCD data panel may shows Battery will be exhausted soon or Battery must be recharged, even though the battery capacity is sufficient.I am installing the fix and will see if this causes the early battery dead indication to go away.4-11-2009 Update:I almost never use my Canon 40D anymore now that I have my Canon 5D Mark II.  The photos are that much better then the 40D.  I mainly use the 40D as a backup body at weddings and if I need the speed of the 6 frames a second for birds in flight.  The 5D Mark II raw photos respond much better in DPP and allow much better cropping.  Still if I could not afford a 5D Mark II and were on a budget I would be very happy with the 40D as a main camera as it has proven to be a very reliable camera even after thousands of photographs.[...].[...]", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hands-on first impressions...", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R1M4YLP2V34CTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon's new cameras at this level are often criticized as \"merely an upgrade\".  This stems from two facts, Canon wishes to produce a desirable camera at a reasonable price, and they are starting from a pretty solid base.  Yet if you look deeper, the 40D is the most significant upgrade in the 10D, 20D, 30D line.  Of course, most things are much like the previous cameras.  As far as size and weight, it's very similar, although I thought the grip improvements made the camera fit a little better in my hands.  (I did not have an optional grip to try on the camera).Most of the hype will be on the upgrade to 10 megapixels and the 3\" LCD with \"Live View\".  While the former may be criticized as merely catching up to the XTi and competition, we must not overlook the 14-bit processing.  This is a huge boost in image capability if used properly.  Those that shoot RAW, and those that understand the desirability of the \"Hightone Priority\", will gain the most benefit.  The LCD upgrade is handy, especially combined with its greater color range, but \"Live View\" without autofocusing my not be that beneficial to most.  However, something very interesting for some is \"PC Live\", which allows the user to connect to a computer, view the image live on that computer, and operate the camera (including focus) remotely from the computer.While the AF improvements usually get second billing, this may actually be the biggest benefit to sports photographers (although the boost to 6.5 fps is welcome).  The 30D only used a cross-basis system at the center point, where the 40D uses this system at all nine positions.  This should greatly improve the off center speed and accuracy.  Additionally, the center point (the most often used) has been boosted in performance.The viewfinder has been increased in magnification, which should be welcomed to all.  But people who must use eyeglasses should be amazed at the viewfinder being both larger and better eye relief (meaning they will be able to see the viewfinder better, even though their eyeglasses push their eye further back).Durability has been improved (including extending the internal metal chassis inside the grip) making a good design even better.  The sensor cleaning filter is also welcome.Images look sharp, but I haven't really put the continuous AF (Servo) to a real sports challenge (just cars down a city street).  Additionally, I don't have any real feedback on high ISO shooting, although Canon has traditionally done well here.Comparisons to the competition are everywhere.  Image quality wise, the 14-bit processing and hightone control can come in handy for more critical users vs. all other 10 megapixel cameras that are cheaper.  For sports guys, the 6.5fps comes cheap, as $1,000 will only get you 3fps.  Only the Pentax K10D comes close in build quality, under $1 grand.As of this writing, Nikon has introduced, but is not close to shipping, the D300.  On paper, it's all of the 40D and more (12 megapixel, higher quality LCD, more AF points), but at a price rumored to be $1,800-$2,000, body only.  Additionally, Sony will soon have a higher end product.  Will they have enough more to justify the price?

Just not enough of an upgrade for my money. Then the 40D showed its head.. and Wow! Finally a worthy upgrade! The Huge display LCD makes my 20d look like a child's camera... The live view, I figured would be for amateurs, but I was Wrong! Live View mode allows you to fine-tune manual focusing like never before. With the live mode turned on, you can digitally zoom into any area on the live image, and see it at 5x or 10x zoom, and you can see your focusing change down to the millimeter!.. It's awesome.Also, the 10mp is nice, but honestly you will likely not even notice this difference.If fast photography is your thing (sports or wildlife) nothing beats the 6.5fps.. I thought the 20d was fast, but it feels old compared to this new machine.One bit of advice, get at least a 4gb card.. If you shoot raw or raw+jpeg like I do, then you will fill those 1 and 2gb cards in no time.The feel of this 40d is much the same as all the series, but the back buttons have been moved to make room for the huge LCD.. Not a big deal, but you will be able to adapt.Almost forgot, the settings dial now has 3 custom options on it.. Very Cool. This effectively allows you to make custom functions for one touch changes to every important setting all at once. I have one setting that has 400 ISO, continuous shooting, center weighted metering, and several other settings, all for shooting animals on the run. With one turn of the dial, all my settings are now set for landscape; 100ISO, 1/2 stop exposure bracketing, evaluative metering, ect..It effectively makes missing a photo opportunity impossible, as you don't have to spend 3 minutes making all your adjustments to the camera to adapt to your situation. This is one of the main reasons I pony'd up for this bigger brother to my 20d.All in all, I'm a very happy customer, and unless you really need full frame (I know we can talk ourselves into anything), this camera will make you smile. :)P.S. don't expect to get much out of your 20 or 30D on eBay, as they are going for pennies on the dollar.. keep it as a spare or give to your mother.... ok, sell to your mother..", "Date": "October 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "A phenomenal picture taking machine!", "Author": "JanSobieski", "ReviewID": "R11ZWREXVVA061", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The 40D is a phenomenal camera with excellent high ISO performance (though not appreciably better than my 20D in  my own tests), more megapixels (10MP), rudimentary weather sealing, improved fps rate, automatic dust removal, spot metering, a 3 inch LCD, auto ISO and improved autofocus.

It is an excellent camera - make no mistake about that, however  I'm disappointed that the autofocus wasn't further improved.The pictures have a smooth buttery depth similar to my 20D - to my eye, possibly slightly better.  They are simply beautiful (taken mostly with my 70-200 L).  In my own tests, the noise performance is roughly equivalent to the 20D.  Canon has managed to add the extra megapixels without additional noise - quite a feat though I suspect that the APS sized sensor has reached the maximum number of pixels that can be packed in without degrading the high ISO performance and dynamic range both every bit as important, if not more so, than the number of pixels.  The menu system is much improved over my 20D and there are three user defined modes that one can easily accessed.  The camera feels essentially the same in my hands as my old 20D.  While the additional 2 megapixels don't add much in terms of picture quality they do provide some head room for cropping.  The door to the CF card has a more secure feel to it than my 20D.  The 3 inch viewing screen is a vast improvement over my 20D, bright and clear.  And it focuses far more quickly and accurately than my 20D.Canon has enjoyed a dominant position in the digital SLR market ever since the D30.  It's lead, in this segment of the market, mostly evaporated with the introduction of Nikon's D200, the D40X and the D80.  With these cameras Nikon pulled even, or close enough to establish themselves as legitimate contenders.  Still Canon has had the edge in high ISO performance.  The problem is that Canon has rested on its laurels and insisted on improving its cameras incrementally, protecting the market of their more expensive cameras.  Certain feature sets (such as professional grade auto-focus and weather sealing) have been withheld in an attempt to maintain the clear distinctions between Canon's various camera lines while Nikon has been much more generous in incorporating advanced features lower down their product food chain. Canon's strategy worked just fine when Canon enjoyed a dominant lead over the competition, but as I mentioned its lead has been severely cut into by Nikon and now even Sony is introducing a respectable DSLR.  None of the foregoing detracts from the fundamental fact that this is a fantastic camera.For the money, the 40D is a great buy.  It is the best camera for the money Canon has introduced so far and, though not particularly daring, still represents a very good buy at this price point, but Nikon's D40x and D80 currently offer better values and the Nikon D300, though priced higher, is much more feature rich.  The 40D's picture quality is simply fantastic and its high ISO performance is, at this point in time, STILL the gold standard for this class of camera and in this size sensor.  But it could have been so much more had Canon simply listened to their customers and understood that the digital SLR market is no longer being defined by Canon alone.  I'm giving this camera only 4 stars because Canon should have given us more.If you own a 10D or a 20D (as I did) the upgrade to a 40D does make some sense.  However, if you own a 30D the upgrade is a bit more difficult to rationalize.  IMO, in the area the counts most, image quality, there is not a significant improvement over the 20D or 30D to justify the upgrade at this time PARTICULARLY in light of the fact that Nikon has raised the bar substantially.  Canon will have to come to the table quickly with a much improved version of the 40D including pro grade auto-focus and real weather sealing that most have been asking for.For first time buyers, the build quality and features are excellent justifying the purchase price, but unless you are married to the Canon system, as I am, take a close look at the various offerings from Nikon including the upcoming D300, the D40x and the D80.  I just wish Canon had been more aggressive and daring with this camera giving its customers more of the features they have been clamoring for.  The very good news is that Nikon is back in the saddle again.  This can only be good for all DSLR consumers in general and Canon owners in particular as more features and capabilities will be packed into all future offerings.

It's fast enough to get out of your way. It has enough resolution for giant prints. And you can get it now, in 2014, for $200. Incredible.I bought this camera in 2007 and replaced it with a 50D this year. That was dumb, particularly since the focus adjustment feature on that body turned out not to help my bum lens. The 50D had a better LCD and marginally worse image quality. I still recommend the 50D and consider it a bargain, but it's debatable whether the extra coat of shellac relative to this 40D is worth almost twice the price. The 30D before it ($200 used) was missing the AF-on button and had the antiquated pre-tab interface. This 40D and the 50D are totally the sweet spot of used DSLRs right now.So what's good? Speed, UI, image quality, dynamic range, and reliability. It has over 9 stops of dynamic range, so you're less likely to blow the highlights as with every other 8-stop body. Files are clean and usable up to ISO 1600. They're very forgiving to adjust in Adobe Camera Raw, even in tungsten lighting that's giving me blue shadows with my 5D II at high ISO. Seriously, this is one of Canon's all-time great sensors; in some ways, it's even more forgiving than the 6D.Speed, speed, speed. 6.3 FPS is enough for any amateur. Everyone I hand it to takes two or three shots by accident. Super-short shutter lag and mirror blackout. AF capable of tracking most ground-based objects, and unlike the 5D/5D II, the outer points actually work. It has a huge raw buffer and nearly instant image review. The 50D is about 15% faster in some metrics, but it's the difference between very quick and blazing.What are you giving up?* AF tracking is so-so relative to the 7D. Decent.* LCD is low-res. Takes effort and a lot of zooming to gauge sharpness.* Weather sealing isn't. Don't stand in the rain.* No movie mode.* No micro-focus adjust.* No 'AF-On' button on Canon's battery grip.* Auto-ISO is useless (and remained so on every other body until the 5D III)* Pixel density is lower (though there's a lot less additional detail in the 18MP bodies than you'd think)In other words, stuff that mostly doesn't matter. This 40D is just an extremely polished product. In actual use, the 50D, 60D, and 7D aren't any better for stills, except for the AI Servo on the last. It's a steal.

The KM5d was not a bad rig, but as the kids got older the action moved too fast for the KM to catch it. The main issues were the focus speed and the shutter speeds allowed by the legacy lenses. Sony Alpha made some of these issues better, but that system only has two fast focus motors - for the 70-200 and one other. It's just very limiting and about 25% more expensive than Canon or Nikon equivalents. So, I decided to change to one of the two big guys. After extensive testing, I settled on the Canon system and the 40d in particular because of the speed of operation (at least in my hands) and the price point for the items I wanted, which ended up being almost $1k less than the Nikon solution based on a D300. Also, the Canon system had lenses that overlapped range where I wanted them to, and this is reflected in the system I carry. Many other reviews split hairs on ISO 3200 performance, and  this got me going for a little bit, but the fact is that if you are pushing that hard, the photos are going to be very grainy. Slightly less or more is not the issue, IMHO. Over quite a broad range of conditions, this camera is just great.So, now I have the equipment performance headroom that my KM was nowhere near providing, and my photography, which did NOT stink previously, has taken a good step up. I get the action shots on a more consistent basis. The slides into second base are spectacular! If you are looking for a step up from the older Canons, or are switching to a system with some breadth like I was, this is a great choice!", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not Sure I Love This One - But It's Growing On Me", "Author": "Dom Miliano", "ReviewID": "RCE46P0UR9M0M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a Canon user for many years with 4 EOS bodies and lots of \"L\" glass in the camera cabinet. However, I needed an inexpensive digital SLR quickly for a magazine assignment so I bought a Nikon D70S because I had a lot of Nikon lenses and I didn't really like the viewfinder and feel of the Canon 20D. The Nikon has served me well for a couple of years but now, all of my magazines are 100% digital so before I jumped on the Nikon D300 (a killer camera) I decided to take a second look at Canon's offerings.First impression, with the optional grip, the 40D felt much better in my fat hands than the older models. The viewfinder also seemed improved over the 20D even with my terminal myopia. But what really sold me was the price. The 40D with a grip, spare battery and a flash was still less expensive than the Nikon D300 body alone. If I added their grip and a spare battery, I would be way over the Canon. (But the D300 is a wonderful machine and I wish I had one.)I have been using the Canon since Memorial Day where I shot 2 days of racing at Lime Rock. The images were sharp, had good color and the files showed no noise up to ISO 800 (as high as I have ever had to go). The motor drive is fast too - you can really fill up a 2 gig card fast with Raw files or even large/fine jpegs.I like the 1.6X factor for long lenses but, like any non-full-frame digital, it hurts a bit on the wide end.The screen isn't as clear as I would like but it's big enough - much bigger than the D70S. The menus are simple and I have not had to really crack the manual very often to resolve questions. I especially like the way you can change the file sizes - picking your resolution is easy enough for rank novices.Battery life is excellent. The viewfinder is quite good - even with glasses I can see edge to edge without mashing my face against the camera back. However, the Nikon D3 with its High EyePoint finder is still the gold standard for eye glasses wearers (Canon please take note).It's a pretty heavy camera with the grip, 2 batteries and a 70-200 f:2.8 hanging around your neck but no more so than my EOS 1V.Autofocus is quick and accurate - it follows fast moving race cars delivering lots of sharply focused images provided your long-lens technique is good. The first time I used the 40D with a 100-400 IS lens, racked out to an effective 640 MM, I got a bunch of soft images. These were my own fault - I am still learning how to shoot and pan with a lens that long. a mono-pod helped a bit and I boosted the shutter speed too. After several hundred images, I think I am close to knowing what I need to do.I think this camera represents an outstanding value, it is, in fact, a bargain when compared to the Nikon D300. The image quality (for what I do - i.e., large/fine jpegs for magazine reproduction) is fantastic. While the Nikon D300 and the D3 would make larger files, their price makes them less appealing and the end results (i.e., the way the pictures look in the magazine) would be identical.The only problem I am having is psychological! When I shot film, I always used the top pro cameras - Leica M's, Nikon F's and Canon EOS 1's. Now, I am using a semi-pro camera and it bothers me. The problem is, of course, mine and not Canon's.Buy the 40D with confidence - it is a very good digital camera.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worthy upgrade from the EOS-30D", "Author": "FredM", "ReviewID": "R1NGLORFMRWWB5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you own a Canon 30D, this camera is a worthy upgrade.  If you're still working with a Canon 20D, it's a no-brainer.

In the past, I have always felt that I could get digital results at least as good as the most expensive digital cameras by scanning a slide or negative on a relatively inexpensive scanner. I have held off buying a digital camera until I felt I was buying a truly professional quality camera at a good price. Through the years, the list of reasons for converting to digital photography has become increasingly long, but until now (at least in my opinion) it has never included \"professional quality at a good price.\" The 40M meets that need for me.  It has many more features than I can imagine ever using, but in the end it is affordable and shoots at professional standards, and I think that counts a lot. But connection to the camera also counts a great deal.I have used Canon cameras since I bought my first F1 in the mid-1970s. During this period I wrote industrial articles and always provided my own photographs (and needed a bullet proof camera). The F1 and a Pentax 4X6 were my primary work cameras.  But I liked the F1 so much, it was also my primary play camera until the light shoe fitting finally wore completely out. I loved that camera so I replaced it with another Canon, the EOS ElanII, which I never much liked. I never felt \"connected\" to that camera.  In fact, photography has been a bit of a pain since then. For the past 10 years I have seldom really enjoyed a photo outing, and had pretty much quit carrying a camera at all.The first time I picked up a 40D, I felt the kind of connection I used to feel with the old F1.  It feels like an extension of my wrist. I carry it like I carried the F1, in my hand and not around my neck -- ready to lift and shoot.Intrestingly, I especially like the camera's weight.  It is heavy; that's nice. I have always felt an SLR should be heavy enough to overcome any shutter shake. But, perhaps more important, the camera feels like a camera and not like a deck of cards.I have checked out the many features of the camera but they are discussed in great depth by others in this venue who know much more than I do about the capabilities of digital cameras. As for me? I use the features and find them much better than my Elan -- but that ain't saying much.On the other hand, I have always liked the lenses I purchased for the Elan over the years, and they work nicely on the 40D.In brief, I have found much to like in this camera and some things to love.  At the same time, I have found nothing I dislike.  I am back to going on photo outings just for the joy of using the camera.  For a person waiting for professional quality at a reasonable price?

Henly", "ReviewID": "R2BC2DNB6NO1CO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background----------New to SLR/dSLR.  I've been shooting a variety of digital P&S; cameras for about 8 years.Motivation----------Kept missing potentially great shots of my newborn due to slow P&S; performance; indoor/low-light pictures rarely turned out nice; couldn't get a good shot of birds to save my life!  dSLR looked like it could address these problems.Decision Process----------------I decided on Canon, in part due to a relative to who has a nice collection of 'L' glass that I hope to borrow.  :)  I was waffling between the XTi/XSi on value/features, and I became aware of Canon's rebate on the 40D.  So I went to a camera shop and tried out the 40D, the XSi, and the XTi.  The 40D felt perfect in my hands, while the Rebel bodies felt small and awkward.  It was just a matter of time before I convinced myself that the 40D with 28-135mm kit lens was worth the few hundred dollar premium over the XSi or XTi kit packages.Experience So Far-----------------I'm very pleased with most aspects of my 40D.  Some warned that SLR photography was terribly complicated, and that I should start off on a \"simpler\" camera.  But I've found it's simple enough learn the basic concepts, master them, and then gradually learn more advanced techniques.  The 40D is a great tool for learning about photography. I'm spending almost all my time in Manual mode, and most of my pictures are coming out much better than I was getting with my P&S; cameras.  Plus, I'm having a blast with my new hobby!What I like-----------+ Image quality.  If I do my job and get the exposure right, IQ is really great.  I'm also learning about how to post-process to recover photos where I blew the exposure a bit.+ Viewfinder.  I was concerned that I'd have trouble using the viewfinder, since I was so accustomed to using the LCD as a \"live view\" with my P&S; cameras.  Not so.  I adapted to the bright and informative viewfinder immediately.+ Speed.  Startup time, taking a first shot, followup shots...all nearly instantaneous.  6.5 shots/second is astounding compared to my P&S; cameras.+ High-ISO performance.  I'm very picky about noise, but ISO800 looks great on the 40D, and ISO1600 isn't bad.  This would be unthinkable on my P&S; cameras.  The good high-ISO noise performance allows me to shoot more confidently in lower-light situations, and not have to use the flash as much.+ Ergonomics.  The 40D feels great in my hands.  Heavier and bulkier than the Rebel line, but at just over 1.5 lbs it still feels comfortable to me even when I'm out shooting for a couple hours.+ Menu/layout.  Some complain about redundancy of the dials and joystick, but I don't mind having more choices.  Since I'm in Manual mode shooting RAW most of the time, many of the menu settings simply aren't relevant to me.  It took me maybe 2 days to get comfortable navigating and finding what I needed.+ LCD.  Nice and big, clear and bright.+ Battery life.  I'm getting around 500 images on a single charge -- very happy with that.+ Auto Focus.  For the most part, AF has been dead-on accurate and fast.+ 28-135mm IS lens.  I've had good luck shooting macros, portraits, landscapes, and everything in between.  This lens is probably a bit outdated, but it is capable of taking really nice pictures.  I think it's a great lens for a beginner to learn on.What I don't like------------------ Power switch.  What's been reported is true: the power switch is in a goofy and annoying location.  It's not a deal-breaker, but Canon should change this when they update the 40D.- Low-light AF.  Sometimes in low-light situations the AF \"hunts\" for something to focus on.  I don't know whether to blame the 40D or the 28-135mm lens.- LCD.  While the LCD is bright and easy to see, the 40D is well behind competing brands in the number of pixels in the display.  More pixels could help the photographer determine with better accuracy whether a shot is in focus.  Along the same lines, the camera uses a small thumbnail JPEG in the LCD display, so it is impossible even to zoom in and determine with certainty whether the shot was in focus.- Print button.  What a waste of a perfectly good button!  :)Bottom Line-----------From my experiences so far, I highly recommend the 40D.  With Canon's rebate it's a fantastic camera for the price.  You can probably take just as good pictures with an XTi or XSi, so if you're interested in a Canon in this price range, be sure to try out all three before making a decision.  For me, the ergonomic and speed advantages of the 40D were well worth the price differential.This is a camera that can be put to good use by amateurs and professionals alike.  Technology moves fast, and I'm sure in a year from now some of the features of the 40D will seem dated.

I was enthralled with this camera, and recommended the camera to a large number of my photography friends.  At the end of the Stanley Cup Playoffs I had planned to attend a couple of Calder Cup Finals games and shoot.  About 100 frames into the first game, I received an \"Err 99\" on the display screen.  I was horrified, especially since I didn't have my backup with me.  First I tried powering off, then on - same problem.  I changed CF Cards, and still no change.  I switched batteries, only to get that ugly-looking \"Err 99\" error again.  As a last resort, I even switched lenses, thinking that maybe I had bumped my lens or something.  And when I saw the \"Err 99\" message yet again, I sighed, packed away my camera and resigned myself to simply enjoying the game as a regular spectator.Needless to say, this turned out to be a hardware issue (the shutter).  Canon claims that the EOS 40D's shutter is good for 100,000 cycles. I've only had the camera for a couple of months, so I know I'm not even close to the shutters useful life.  While I have it now sitting in Canon's Factory Repair Center in New Jersey, I know I will get it back soon.  I'm just disappointed.I did some further review and found this \"Err 99\" problem to be a common cause of equipment failure in the Canon EOS 40D.  That having been said, I would still select this camera body for both daily and special events shoots.  I believe that Canon will continue to support me on this issue.

My Rebel XT that I've owned for 18 months recently decided to take pictures that are all black (me's thinking the shutter curtain is broken) so I quickly ordered a 40D since my daughter's softball season is coming to a close.  After spending a weekend with the 40D taking sports/action photos and general playing around, here are my primary comparisons between the 40D and Rebel XT, in no particular order:1) I was concerned that the heavier/larger 40D would be a negative in terms of weight/size and fit in my camera bag. To my relief, it fits in my bag, weight really isn't an issue, and the larger size only takes about a day to get used to.  In fact, after spending the weekend with the 40D, the Rebel seems too small.2) 6 frames a second is a *huge* difference from 3 frames a second.  I was able to capture action with the 40D that I often missed with the Rebel at my daughters fastpitch softball games.3) Focus is much improved over the Rebel.  Out of 500+ shots, I only had a handful where the focus did not hit.  Compare that to about 10-20% on the Rebel.4) I use the 70-200 F/4 L IS for Softball. During twighlight games, I was able to actually use ISO 800 to keep the shutter speed up.  ISO 800 was just too noisy IMO on the Rebel.  I'm not sure if IQ on the 40D is better than the Rebel or not in other aspects - it certainly isn't worse, maybe just a tad better..??5) I love the thumbwheel - I can very quickly review and delete pics between pitches (say, if I was shooting a batter and she didn't swing), which was more cumbersome to do on the Rebel.6) I'm hoping the automatic sensor cleaning keeps dust off the 40D sensor better than the Rebel7) Haven't setup the custom C1/C2/C3 settings yet - but I can see they are going to be very valuable8) So what don't I like?  Really, it's only one minor item - I like the On/Off switch and location better on the Rebel.

A weather sealed package allowed me to shoot in light rain while touring Asia, but I'd dare not shoot in anything more than that.The 3.0\" LCD is nice but doesn't show the full color range as when viewing on a monitor. Live view is good only for showing the composition. It is a bit slow for shooting anything moving. The viewfinder should be the first and only place to go. Also, using only the viewfinder allows you to better brace the camera for less blur. Be sure to use the on-camera highlights feature in review to show parts of the picture that are overexposed.I don't recommend using the pop-up flash unless used with a pop-up diffuser. A dedicated flash unit like the 580ex II is highly recommended. Using pocketwizards or even just the wireless infrared is a good start.This is a very nice starting camera. If and when I decide to buy a new full frame camera, this will be a nice backup camera. I use this with 2 SanDisk Extreme III 8GB CF memory cards. Try not to get too big or too small of a memory card. 10.1MP shows up as 3888x2592. For JPEG, files are about 4-5mbs each. For RAW, files are about 10-20mbs each. The 40D has the option to shoot both RAW+JPEG at the same time, but at a reduced rate since the buffer can't keep up. I shoot almost exclusively in RAW, and the buffer is about 6 shots continuous. In JPEG, the buffer shows 99. High speed burst is a good option to use, and I used it for 3 shot bursts.The manual controls are good. A dedicated wheel to the right of the LCD controls the f-stop and a smaller wheel behind the shutter release controls the shutter speed. ISO, metering, color balance, shot setting, AF, and AE lock are right behind that wheel on the top right corner. The grip on the body feels easy to use and the finish is just right all around.The bundle that is included with the camera is nice: the industry standard neckstrap, DPP, cordless wall charger, and li-ion battery pack. The neck strap is decent, but I wear it backwards as it irritates my neck. Digital Photo Professional is the proprietary software that is included and it is great for after shot changes for white balance and to a small part, exposure compensation at 1/3 stops. The battery charger is small and does not have cords to deal with; the prongs fold down and plug directly into the outlet. The battery pack is li-ion, charges relatively fast, and looks like 2 AA batteries combined.Recommended with:- Canon Speedlite 580ex II- Canon 50mm f/1.8- Canon 50mm f/1.4- Canon 24-70mm f/2.8L- Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS- Canon BG-E2N Battery Grip- Lowepro Slingshot 200- SanDisk Extreme III (2GB, 4GB, 8GB) CF memory cards- SanDisk SanDisk CF Type I/II ImageMateBottom line:Highly Recommended! If you're in the market for a DSLR and are looking at the rebel line (XSi, etc) you might as well get the 40D or other x0D series instead.

I wanted to stick with Canon (yes my old AF lenses work with the 40D).Did my research, went to my local camera store, checked my old lenses on the 40D, tried nicely to \"deal\" with them. They still couldn't touch Amazon's price for this kit.In the four days (yes, only four) it took for the 40D to reach me (free shipping, incidentally), I bought and read David Busch's book dedicated to the 40D. Highly recommend it. So I was ready.My camera arrived early this morning. Battery fully charged. I waited till later this afternoon, when the light is better, and took it shooting.Nature stuff. Children on playgrounds. Birds. Animals. Speedboats on the river. A volleyball game. Portraits of my nephew's wife and their one-year-old daughter (no-flash shots and built-in fill-flash shots). Some with IS on, most with IS off.Just basic stuff to see what the Basic Modes did on default. Looked at some histograms as I shot, but didn't make any adjustments. (Now that I've looked at the defaults, I will start tweaking the settings for my own preferences.)Over 300 shots, in JPEG Fine only. No RAW (yet.)Got home, plugged the CF card into the reader (both from Adorama, though after the fact I realized I could have gotten a slightly better deal from Amazon).Using FastStone's free Image Viewer (which I wanted to try), I started sorting through my shots, comparing them side by side, tagging those I wanted to delete, batch renaming the ones I kept, etc.I must have examined my first shot for five minutes, minutely examining the details. Stunned! STUNNED! At HUGE magnifications!With every shot, I just kept shaking my head in amazement. Virtually FLAWLESS exposure! (One or two had slight clipping in highlights (on the histograms), yet still with incredible detail. One or two were slightly soft on the subject's focus (my fault). Incredible color!Continuous bursts on the volleyball players and the speedboats and the bikers on bike trails were jaw-dropping! PERFECT focus! PERFECT exposure! At 6.5 fps! (Unheard of, even just a few years ago, at this price point.)I'm fluent in Photoshop, but prefer to get it right the first time, in the camera.I've yet to scratch the surface of the 40D's capabilities.

I shot fifty or so exposures with it just to make sure it was in working order and, for what it is, it's a fine lens.  I wouldn't pay the $400+ retail price for it, but for a $200 kit lens, it's a fair deal.  Build quality's on the cheap side and it's soft wide open on either end, but it sharpens up considerably at f5 on the wide end and f6 zoomed and is solid at f8 and above throughout the range.  The IS works well.  The zoom range is excellent for a goof off or vacation lens.  Beyond that, its merits are questionable.As for the camera, I honestly thought my next upgrade, having gone from Canon film bodies to the original Digital Rebel, and then the 20D,  would be to the 5D.  I love the idea of a full frame sensor but can't justify spending the cash on a 1DS Mark II, much less III.  The 5D had come down in price enough, and I was ready to pull the trigger.  A friend of mine talked me into looking at the 40D, and it does have some drool-inducing features.  And, without the kit lens, it was about 40% less than the 5D.  So I ended up with this, and I have not been disappointed.The features I love:Interchangable focus screens- I apparently have balance issues, because every landscape photo I've ever taken has undergone a Photoshop free transform before presentation.  The grid screen has solved that little problem.  I think its also improved my overall composition.Improved viewfinder- It's almost shocking when you first put your eye up to the viewfinder.  Everything's so crystal clear and so well presented.The build- Quality, quality, quality.  Still getting used to the button placement, but I like it.  Very quiet.The custom presets- Brilliant, particularly if you shoot often in the same lighting environment with the same lens (indoor sports, theater).Live view- Yes, it's a pain in the rear to use, but it's less pain than trying to compose night shots through the viwfinder, particularly if your tripod is set lower or higher than eye-level.Digic III processor- It's fast and, after shooting a few hundred RAW+jpegs, I have to say that I'm very impressed with the color and tonal accuracy.  It's a vast improvement over the previous processors.The rest of the updates I could take or leave.  The autofocus may be faster, but I don't see a huge improvement in accuracy.  The self-cleaning sensor is probably nice to have, but I never had a problem with dust on the senor in my other two cameras.  The screen size is nice, but I was never unhappy about the screen on the 20D, and the resolution didn't make a leap.  And my only complaint is the crop factor, but the selection of ultra-wide angle lenses is improving.I noticed in some reviews people mention needing high pixel counts to get good enlargements.  This is not true.  The 6.1MP Digital Rebel writing in large jpegs had enough muscle to provide razor sharp 16x20s so long as you weren't crop-happy.  Pixel count is just one small measure of overall image quality.  Your ability to capture a good image will have an impact on how big you can print long before the pixels come into play.  There isn't a DSLR on the market today that isn't capable of creating images that can be \"enlarged\" to full poster-size prints, if not larger.  You just need to focus on making every pixel count.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Just got this camera - It's Great!", "Author": "The Smart Teenager", "ReviewID": "RZMNDL5VV9B6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just unboxed this camera a few hours ago.  I've just gotten into SLR Photography, upgrading from a Canon Digital Elph point-and-shoot.  Let me just say: if you are an upgrader, you can't go wrong with getting the Canon EOS 40D.First Impressions:-The Screen Size is AWESOME.  It's really big.  The only issue is that, when using the viewfinder, my face was hitting the screen.  I decided to place a screen protector I had on it.-Focusing is fast and accurate - I tested this in a relatively low light situation.  I was very impressed in random shots and complicated shots where the focus wasn't evident the steps the camera took to pick an appropriate autofocus.-Flash is powerful-The lens included in this kit is wonderful for the many of the reasons listed above - Fast AF and IS (Image Stabilizing).-The camera is very nice to hold.  I was considering the Canon Rebel Xti as well, and the EOS 40D is definitely much more comfortable to hold.  The bigger size, I think, is worth it.-The viewfinder is nice, and gives you all the details you could want regarding your picture.-The flash is powerful but won't 'overblow' - close flash shots of people's faces look good.-I love the control scheme - much more intuitive than many of the point-and-shoots that I have used.  The dial wheel is an awesome way to go through your images, and the \"joystick\" allows you to explore zoomed in images very intuitively.Overall, I feel I have made a great choice in investing in this camera as I learn more about photography.  Luckily, the camera is easy enough to use that one can use it as a very large point-and-shoot, giving me the freedom to take great shots while learning about the more complex details.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Did my homework, bought it, then returned it.", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R1RRIGNOIJDWO0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For months I researched dSLRs and, after considering the Nikon D40, D60, and D80, had just about settled on the Rebel XSi.  Then Canon announced their rebates, bringing the 40D within reach.  I jumped on the bargain, ordered the kit with the 28-135 lens, and was delighted when it arrived.  After a week of shooting, though, my excitement faded for one main reason: inconsistent metering.  Before I go into detail, let me tell you what I really liked, even loved, about the camera.1.  Ergonomics.  The bigger grip (compared to the XSi) felt great in my medium-sized hands.  I especially liked the rubber texture up high on the back, where my thumb rested naturally.  At first I thought the heavier size of the 40D would bother me, but it seemed a good match for the lens--very well balanced.  The shutter button was positioned perfectly, angled slightly forward toward the front of the camera rather than directly on top.  I also liked that (unlike on Nikons), the 40D had no other buttons immediately adjacent to the shutter.  The shutter button is segregated from the others by the top control wheel.Many experts will tell you that you should base your camera choice in large part on what feels best in your hands.  That way you'll be inclined to use it more often.  To me, the 40D felt absolutely perfect.2.  Controls/Displays.  One thing you buy with a semi-pro dSLR is direct, one-button access to most of the camera's critical settings and adjustments.  The three buttons on top of the 40D control six key functions, depending on whether you spin the top wheel or the quick-control dial on the camera back.  This can be daunting at first, but I caught on quickly and found this infinitely preferable to navigating through multi-layered menus.  Having used Canon point-and-shoots, I was familiar with their menu scheme and found the 40D's easy and intuitive to use.  As for the top LCD display, I could take it or leave it.  Some folks love it, but my 40+ year-old eyes found the type a bit small, and I just as often turned on the main LCD to view various settings as I changed them.3.  Speed.  I might have actually ranked this number one.  I like to shoot kids sports, and the 6.5 fps burst rate was a huge factor in my decision to go for the 40D.  I found the autofocus to be fast, too, more so than its Nikon competition (but not noticeably faster to me than the Rebel).  The autofocus wasn't, in my experience, 100% accurate, though this may be more the fault of the lens than the camera.It all sounds pretty good, right?  So what happened?  Based on everything I had read, I expected the pictures to be amazing.  In large part, they were good - excellent color, resolution, and contrast, though a little soft without some sharpening in post-processing - but they weren't \"amazing.\"  My biggest complaint was that I experienced a higher-than-expected percentage of underexposed shots.  Oddly, pictures I took on an mildly overcast day with what should have been non-challenging lighting and background - kids on the sidewalk with a gray road, green grass, and neutral-colored houses across the street - were way underexposed, probably a whole stop or more.  I tried this on two different days, with a variety of ISO, shutter speeds, and aperture settings - even tried using the \"Basic Modes\" - and all the images were underexposed (both to my eye and by virtue of examining the histogram, which was sharply skewed to the left).  Still, if it were just a matter of the exposures being a bit darker than I preferred, I would have been content to just dial the exposure compensation up a third or two-thirds and shoot away.  But it was more complicated than that.  The evaluative metering seemed to do better with high-contrast scenes, with sunlit objects and shadows behind the people in the center of the frame.  But even there, when I took two or three shots with the same settings and roughly the same composition, two might be perfect and one might be underexposed by two-thirds or a whole stop.I fully expect to get some flaming comments about how I just needed to get to know the camera, learn more about the various metering modes, become a better photographer, etc., etc.  Maybe so, but I guess I wanted my $[...] camera to produce more consistent results without a lot of tinkering, especially in photos of what were truly uncomplicated scenes.Some might also say the camera was defective and I should have just exchanged it instead of returning it for a refund.  Again, maybe so.  However, there are a lot of user comments on various internet forums complaining of underexposure with the 40D.  One prominent review site (dcresource.com) recounts the reviewer's experience in two weeks of shooting: \"My only photo quality complaint is that the 40D has the tendency to underexpose. I took hundreds of photos on my vacation, and the majority of them were underexposed by 1/3 or 2/3-stop.\"  Unfortunately, I missed all this during my initial research.I may have had a bad copy of the camera; perhaps the lens contributed to the issues as well--who knows?  Nonetheless, the way I see it, this is a mature product, having been on the market for almost a year now.  Any quality control issues should have already been ironed out, and I just wasn't willing to take a chance on spending the money to send it back only to get another lemon.Based on the many glowing reviews here and elsewhere, my experience is apparently not typical.  It's a funny thing about reliability/satisfaction and repair ratings.  Even Consumer Reports ranks Canon among the best.  But to those customers in the minority who end up with defective, or simply unsatisfying, products, the odds don't mean a thing.I'm going to try a Nikon.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS40D--Great Camera.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "RS7KDRD9KNLP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've long been a serious photographer for years.

Yes, it could be higher resolution but it's so much bigger and clearer than the 20D that I barely notice. Also higher resolution usually comes at the expense of battery life, so it's always a tradeoff.2. Live View. Not for everyone, but I find it really useful for certain shots that I do tripod-mounted.3. New menus. I love the new menuing system and particularly the ability to have my most commonly-used functions on one screen. A real time-saver out in the field.4. Sensor cleaning. Okay, probably not going to mean never cleaning the sensor again, but any improvement in dust is good.5. ISO display. Yeah, I don't have to remember what ISO I had set, it's there in the display all the time.6. Much better buffer and higher fps. Big improvement here over my 20D. I don't always run into buffer problems with the types of photos I do, but it's nice to know it's not even a concern for me any more. The power-up is also way faster than my 20D.7. From 8 to 10 MP. Not a big deal to me, but as long as the image quality and noise are the same, bigger is better!8. Bigger viewfinder. Wow, noticeable improvement here too, it really doesn't feel as \"tight\" as the 20D.9. Quieter mirror. Really important for some of the situations I shoot in. I sure would like it even quieter, but glad to see it's getting better as the 20D was annoyingly loud.10. Custom User Settings. Ability to create 3 sets of custom settings for specific shooting situations is something I will definitely use. I shoot both indoor and outdoor canine sports and have very specific settings for each, this is a great time (and mistake) saver.11. No accidental loss of photos if you open the card door. You had to be careful with the 20D not to open the door to pull out the memory card before the camera was done writing the images or it would just instantly power down. This has been fixed in the 40D.There are a bunch of other various updates and changes that are of less interest to me...sRAW, some weatherproofing (better than none, but needs to be complete to really be worthwhile), wireless capabilities, tilt correction with the crop function, high ISO noise reduction, etc. It's clear a lot of work went into this camera and it definitely shows.

Brewer \"tbrew\"", "ReviewID": "R2P4CFQ38YACNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 40D is an amazing camera, it's loaded with features, takes incredibly sharp photos, and is an all around fun camera.  As is tradition with my reviews - i'll break this down into a pros and cons section for readability.  Also at the end of the review, i've included some remarks on canon's big brother model for this camera, the 50D.Pros --Autofocus capabilities - one of the biggest advantages of SLR cameras of today as opposed to SLR cameras of many years ago is the ability to autofocus.  Not only is the autofocus with the 40D fast (with the 28-135mm USM kit lens) it is also fairly accurate.  A difference between this camera and canon's lower EOS models (400D, 450D, etc...) is the performance of the camera in low-light situations.  I am a former owner of a 'Rebel XTi (aka 400D) and the camera's ability to focus in low-light situations (Without firing an AF assist beam) was moderate at best.  This is completely different with the 40D.  Also, while the XTi and 40D both share 9 autofocus points (and so does every canon EOS model up to the 5D), the points on 40D are much more sensitive and accurate.-Dynamic range - the camera allows you extreme flexibility in exercising your desire to get the creatively correct exposure (if you don't know what this is check out \"Understanding Exposure\" by Bryan Peterson).  For example, in comparison to the Rebel, the camera adds an extra stop at the shutter speed (1/8000 sec), includes an Auto-ISO setting, and you don't have to set the ISO at 1 stop increments (i.e. ISO 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600).  A nice feature on this camera is that it has three Custom settings on the dials where you can save presets for various shooting situations (for example, I have C1 set as my mirror lockup setting - so instead of entering the custom function menus and finding the mirror lockup and enabling it, i just turn my dial to \"C1\").-Speed - at 6.5 fps this camera is a machine!  To get anymore than that you'd need to have a 1D Mk III.  Unfortunately adding the BG-E2N (or BG-E2) battery grip doesn't add any speed to this already blistering mark (unlike it does with some Nikons) but 6.5 fps is going to be more than enough for most proam photographers.  Of course be sure to get a quick memory card (Don't waste your money on the SanDisk Extreme IV though becuase I don't believe the 40D supports the new UDMA standard - you're better off with a nice Extreme III.  Also, as a side note, for the next two weeks or so SanDisk is offering a big rebate on its cards - check it out).-Image quality - with the correct equipment (a good tripod, the 40D, the 28-135mm USM lens, and canon's $50 shutter release) the sharpness in the photos that this camera puts out are amazing (before even using an unsharp mask in photoshop).  Of course the photos are still high quality while handholding - but some situations mandate that a tripod be used (and really if you always want to get tack sharp photos, then all situations mandate it).  The bottom line is you won't be disappointed by the IQ.  Even the JPEGs on the camera are high quality (thanks to Canon's Digic 3 image professor).  Despite this, i still recommend shooting in RAW + JPEG format for those tricky lighting situations.-The LCD - granted, the LCD is the 900,000 pixel LCD that's found on the D300 (also several hundred dollars more expensive) or the 900,000+ pixel VGA LCD that will be found on the new 50D (see more info below), but at 300,000 pixels and 3.0'', the LCD is a big plus.  The brightness on the LCD of this camera is much improved over earlier EOS Rebel cameras so that you can check out the specs of you photos in the high mid-day sun without looking around to find a shady area.  The ability to view the three separate RGB histograms on this camera is a big plus (as opposed to just the brightness histogram).-Build Quality - with its rugged magnesium alloy body and the weatherproofing measures canon has taken, the 40D is built like a truck.  If you're going to invest over $1,000 in a camera you'll want it to be able to take a beating.  I'm confident in the fact that the 40D can withstand the daily wear and tear of using it.  Granted this isn't the 1Ds Mk III which you can essentially take into a tornado and come out without a scratch on it, but it's also not $7,000.-Noise levels at high ISO settings (ISO 800-1600) - If you plan to be shooting in low light situations, you'll undoubtedly be forced to use higher ISO settings.  Of course higher ISO settings is going to make the images noisier (grainier) as well as possibly distort the color and decrease contrast.  The degree to which the 40D is plagued by these issues is very small.  While i try to make every exposure at ISO 100, there are some situations where I have to reach up for ISO 800-1600 and I'm never disappointed by the resulting photographs.Cons --Cost - This toy does of course come at a fairly hefty price premium.  At $1150 this camera is not going to be for you if you're very budget conscious.  Especially because 1150 is just the beginning, all of you newbies out there will soon discover that as soon as you get the camera you'll be lusting for (very expensive) lenses and (less expensive) acessories.-Weight - the weight on the 40D is certianly formidable.  If you're looking for a camera that's light-weight and small - take a look a the EOS rebel series.  This factor might not affect you if you don't plan to haul or carry your camera around for longer periods of time, but if you do plan to use it in such a manner go to a local camera store (or electroncs store) and be sure to put the camera in your hands, hold it, get a feel for it.-Get the 40D now or wait for the 50D?  As some of you may know, Canon announced that it will be producing what I view as the bigger brother of the 40D and surprisingly they're going to call it the 50D.  I imagine the idea of waiting for the 50D has crossed some of your minds - so I've outlined below some of my ideas on the issue.-Increased number of MP - The number of megapixels on the 50D will be 15.1 as opposed to the 40D's 10.1.  On the same sized sensor, this raises issues of noise, but canon claims the noise levels on the 50D are 1 or 2 stops below those of the 40D.  However, if you plan on consistently making very large prints - then this will be an advantage.  For the rest of us - it's really not worth the extra money.-Digic 4 image processor - Like i mentioned above, the 40D has Canon's Digic 3 image processor while the 50D will have the updated version of this processor - which will probably make a small difference in IQ for someone who shoots in JPEG, but if you shoot in RAW and edit your photos anyway - it doesn't make a difference.-Expandable ISO feature - The camera has the ability to shoot at ISO levels up to 12800.  This is a useless feature.  There will really never be a need to use an ISO level that high.  It's really just a marketing thing because Nikon cameras can reach ISO levels that high.-Speed - the 50D will only be able to shoot 6.3 fps as opposed to the 40D's 6.5 fps.  This is probably a negligible difference.-LCD - as i mentioned above, the LCD on the 50D will be a 900K VGA LCD which promises to be better for viewing images in the field.  If you really rely on your LCD for your workflow then this is a big difference.-Face detection technology - like many of Canon's point and shoot models, the 50D has incorporated face detection in its live view mode.  This is nice but not really that useful because you can just select which AF point you wish to utilize.  Plus Live View really runs the battery down on the camera.-HDMI output - once again, this is a marketing thing, if you really like to look at your pictures on your big screen HD TV though, this is a nice feature.-Cost - of course the 50D is going to cost more than the 40D with the approximate cost for the body $1400 and the cost with the kit lens (supposed to be the new EF-S 18-200mm) at somewhere between $1600-1700.  The final issue is time.  While Canon says that the 40D will be available in October, it's likely that the camera will be delayed because that is often how things work out.", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "skills is better than equipment", "Author": "Adrian Urbano \"Aidz\"", "ReviewID": "R1X25ZCMYGM25P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those who keeps on looking/buying canon 40d and selling it for nikon d300, you're not being reasonable, arguably both cameras work well, mine works well for me but i don't need the fancy of being able to use the tons of functions of nikon d300, it's obviously priced way more but canon 40d makes a lot of sense to me, the moment i saw this i know i can be at ease of it, before i've used my friend's nikon d40x, there are lots of things i can do with it, but there are some functions that i can't access that i have to dig everything just to use a certain function, canon's products ever since are very user friendly, the interface is simple but meaningful, the placement of the buttons and all. you don't need the higher resolution lcd screen, live view? yes it's useful in macro and some tripod work shots, but earlier photographers didn't need lcd to check if their photos are good, for me the live view is a welcome addition, but it's not that essential for every photographer. 40D is good for what it is, everything (or almost everything) you need is already here, as long as the camera has manual, aperture/shutter priority mode, you're good to go. 40D is phenomenal at least for me (good image quality, responsive 6.5fps with digic III, excellent ISO noise handling, sensor cleaning, rugged construction, wide lens range of ef and ef-s system), it's all up to you to decide which camera you want and consider your budget.", "Date": "February 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Well done Canon - you've finally persuaded me to buy a DSLR", "Author": "amazion \"amazion\"", "ReviewID": "R2KK6PXKW0I223", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a film camera user for years (olympus OM2 and a few rangefinders) and i've been watching the DSLR market waiting for the right balance of features, usability and price.

My 40d lived its life with a grip on it at all times. i first bought a cheaper brand when i had the 20d and decided after about a week that i should only use a canon grip on a canon.  there are 2 grip that fit the 40d both are great if you have the older non weather sealed one i would use it.  i upgraded to the newer version because the old one was stolen so it was a no brainer to get the better grip.  it fits great and is of equal quality as the camera.  feels great in my hands and makes shooting portraits so much easier. the grip gives you the option of using 2 batteries. i used 2 batteries in the grip and 2 batteries extra if they go out for years but now i only use one and keep 3 spares and replace them as needed. i found the extra battery life wasnt worth the extra weight.  i may some day upgrade to a 5dii as a back up to my 7d but i would not get rid of this camera i would keep it for my wifes camera to shoot with. and if she ever decided to use something else nikon or whatever i would still keep this 40d as i am very emotionally attached to it. as i tend to do with my cameras.this camera has never given me any trouble ever.  fun fact i have never once in my life shot a raw file (ok once i shot raw plus jpeg but i never once touched the raw files) maybe its because i shot film for years and do everything in the camera.  raw files are bo better then jpegs as long as you know how to adjust your camera everything you can do with raw you can do in camera. at no point has a gallery owner, magazine editor, record label or bride has ever said hey wish you could give me a raw file. i have never regretted shooting jpeg only except when i get hate mail from raw shoots cursing my life. all im trying to say is that the sensor on the 40d is great you can infinity adjust the sensor to do anything you want it to do.  i can make the sensor act like any of the films i shot with in years past. i also shoot black and white in the camera about 70% of the time. you can add color filters in camera as i would in film days. i love the adjust ability of this camera. i shoot canon but would have no problem shooting nikon.  people say they like one outcome over the other but with all the adjustments you can do in the camera with both nikon and canon i would never suggest canon over nikon or vise versa based on the stock output.  i think everyone should adjust there camera to there needs.  again thats only my opinion. my good friend shoots raw and has never once adjusted his camera he shoots it in raw and makes the adjustment later and it works great for him.  there really is no right or wrong way, just your way.  hope this review helped someone out.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "40D Fantastic", "Author": "Kevin B.", "ReviewID": "RCL4KQGZIUKLQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just went through the debate between the 40D and XSi. I finally chose the 40D since it is supposed to be built to last, and the recent $200 rebate from Canon placed the cost ($950 body only) on par with the XSi ($800 body only) at the time of this review. Up until now, I have been using an XT and in only 2 years (and about 6000 photos) the auto focus (AF) LEDs began burning out. One is completely gone and the others have dimmed considerable. I have not found anyone else with this problem so it could be that I had a bad XT. Never the less, the XSi has similar dot type AF LEDs and I was worried that an investment in the XSi would lead to another camera with a limited lifetime (I depend on these LEDs a lot).Although I liked the compactness and lightweight of the XT, little did I realize how convenient the 40D is for fast switching of settings. I love this! I won't go into all the positives/negatives of the 40D as it has been beaten to death by now. However, I will mention a few minor pros and cons that are either seldom mentioned, or not mentioned at all.Pros:1. Much better AF LEDs - more visible squares instead of little dots, hopefully longer lasting.2. More multi-controls and generally setup more user friendly.Cons:1. Auto WB is a little off - especially with incandescent lighting and AUTO setting (seemed more accurate on my XT)2. Thin male pins for the remote connector. Male means that there are pins instead of sockets. The sockets are on the switch itself (RS-80N3 or equivalent). This means if the thin pins bend, the camera gets hurt instead of the cheaper switch. I wish Canon had stuck to the 1/8\" stereo jack as that solution was much more rugged and allowed the wire to rotate (the wire on the RS-80N3/equivalent point out in the direction of the lens only).Hope this helps!", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "Ahmad Alnusif", "ReviewID": "R3TSHR5HE4JLGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the 40D from the Digital Rebel XT (350D).

I'm loving it. 3in screen, large viewfinder, liveview with live histogram, solid feel of the body, pretty clean ISO800, ISO1600 images (at 10mp resolution) are all big upgrades compared to earlier Canons (400D/20D/30D).What surprised me most is the so-called \"3-D effect\" that some people were claiming in other forums. Some pictures I took during daytime have depth (i.e. 3-Dness) that I wasn't seeing with 400D/20D/30D. Canon 5D is supposed to be similar in this respect. Some claim that it is because of smoother tonal gradation (i.e. high precision A/D, 14 bit raw etc).If you are a first time buyer, skip the Rebel line and go to 40D (or, maybe 30D) directly. In my opinion, the color reproduction of Rebel line (300D/350D/400D) is inferior to that of 20D/30D/40.Nikon D80 is also a pretty good camera with a lower price & decent performance. But, image quality at high ISO (i.e. ISO >= 800) is better with Canon.Don't get the kit lens. I would recommend Tamron 17-50 f/2.8 or Sigma 18-50 f/2.8---both very sharp, great all-around lenses with performance comparable to Canon 17-55 f2/8 IS. I would also recommend Sigma 10-20 f/4-5.6 and Canon 70-300 f/4-5.6 IS further down the line.Get a good monitor. If you want precise color reproduction, you'll need to calibrate your monitor.

Wiklanski \"reading rider\"", "ReviewID": "R1GSH8AWXJA24M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Digital SLRs have become all the rage and there are seemingly new (and questionably improved) examples coming out seemingly everyday. Through all of the choices the same principles of camera buying still hold true. Buy the best camera that you can afford that gives you the finest images that you will be proud of.I come from a long history of cameras; I got my start using all manual Olympus OM-1s and Bronica ETRSi (medium format) cameras before finally making a jump to autofocus. With that move I adopted the Canon EOS system based on the quality of its lenses and the stellar eye focusing system.  Fast forward into an increasing digital age and I found myself using digital point and shoots far more than I had expected until finally I decided to add a digital SLR to my collection (I still shoot the manual cameras for more artistic control).While looking it was clear that I didn't want to give up my Canon lens collection so that pretty much narrowed my choice, not to mention that the great reputation for the Digic sensor. Initially I looked at the Rebel XSi, EOS 40D and 50D, figuring that in this spectrum I would find the best choice. The reviews on all 3 cameras are very positive, deservingly so.  The Rebel is a great camera however its two biggest drawbacks are its plastic body which just doesn't feel up to the rigors of a aggressive use, it also does feel a little, well, plasticky. The next factor, and the deciding one at that is its Lilliputian dimensions. It's frankly, just too small. I've talked to a number of camera sales people who have all agreed that they find that it's a great camera for women or men with small hands. While it bills its size as an asset for travelling and its lightness a bonus for carrying, I find that it's just too small to hold well.The 50D, also a fine camera is just that little bit out of the price range for me. Not to mention, that from published reviews, the differences are not necessarily strong enough to warrant the additional price.Which brought me to the 40D, I love the layout of the camera, it fits my hands like me other EOS bodies. I appreciate its size, its sense of \"heft\" and the texture of its body. Its grippy without being sticky, with its coated metal chassis it inspires confidence that it will not be prone to damage or cracks. It simply feels like a quality, professional tool, which is what I want.The included lens produces great results; the images are crisp and wonderfully accurate in terms of color and contrast. I don't generally rely on the screen on the back but it too offers a great preview. In terms of options and controls, it offers anything that you could wish for. I have read people that wish for a tighter spot meter though I am not bothered by its size, I use Photoshop to micro adjust exposure anyway.This is a great camera; it will do all that you ask of it. The images are great, its build quality fantastic and its battery life stellar. If you have existing Canon lens you'll be able to continue to use them, if not, well then you're in for a treat as Canon optics are great. Each of Canon's SLRs cater seemingly cater to a particular audience, though I feel like those lines are blurring. If you seek a near professional caliber camera with plenty of expansion options that is capable of producing your best images then this may well be the camera for you. If you are on the fence between it and the XSi, compare the way both feel in your hands, decide which you prefer. If you are looking at the 50D, ask yourself if you are really going to make use of the additional features or whether you'd like to invest the price difference in a lens.For my money the 40D is a fantastic deal that is more than capable of continuing to expand my personal photographic creativity, let it do the same for you.", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Great Upgrade", "Author": "Maclen", "ReviewID": "RGBKV1I3XBST8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Canon 40D as an upgrade from my Canon 400D XTi, and what an upgrade it is! Everything from the sturdy feel of the body, to the great image quality is a big improvement over the 400D XTi. Even something as simple as the sound of the shutter click is a noticeable benefit for me.Although the XTi is a great camera, which I used to capture some really terrific shots, the quality of shots taken with the 40D is vastly superior. I'm using the same lenses as I did with the XTi and when I did side by side comparisons with the same settings, the images taken with the 40D have much better detail and sharper contrast, giving the photos better depth. The colors are truer, and shooting at low light with a higher ISO setting is also clearly enhanced using the 40D.The body of the 40D feels solid and comfortable in my hands. The heavier weight of the 40D provides much better balance when using larger lenses on the camera.  With the same lenses on the XTi, the camera feels unbalanced, even using the BG-E3 Battery grip. The controls on the 40D are intuitive, and I really like the control dial.

Now in the digital era, photo cameras have come a long way.While I love sophisticated P/S cameras with lots of options to manually select your settings for your photo composition like the new Canon G9, the quality of the image never really satisfied me, you can see the difference between a 10MP P/S or 10MP DSLR in quality with the naked eye, it does not need a magnifying glass to differentiate the two and see the graininess of the photo from the P/S and the clarity of a DSLR photo. This becomes more and more visible the dimmer the lighting conditions get like under sunset or night conditions and your ISO speed has to move up to 400 and higher as high as 1600. Also the speed of a DSLR can be up to 10 frames per second, the 40D shoots at 6.5fps the XTi at 3fps, while a even sophisticated P/S may only take up to 2fps. If you take action photos like in a Formula One race or go to the Olympics this can be critical. But the lag of speed never bothered me as much as did the image quality.I have tried many pro P/S cameras by now the Canon S70, S80, Canon SD900 (for its nice size), and lastly the G9. Neither really satisfied my taste. Last year I briefly had a Canon 30D, a very nice camera, but because of removable lenses, dust sticking to the sensor became an issue for me. Now Canon has developed a \"dust shaker\" technology that rids most of the dust every time the camera is turned on or off. The EOS integrated cleaning system, a very nice feature.After being fed up with the Canon G9 and Canon now having a \"dust removing\" technology I bought a Canon 40D with Canon's 28-135mm USM image stabilizer lens. I really like the nice large LCD and all the new and improved functions. Now with a Canon DSLR you can have a \"Live view\" and see the actual image on the LCD before you shoot. I always liked a Live view in a Pro P/S camera seeing my image on the LCD before you take your photo, now you can have the very same with the Canon 40D.Since digital cameras became 2MP I've been \"upgrading\" my camera every other year to the latest mode,l but in the last 2 years I had 4 different cameras. I hope and think that my new 40D will bring me the joy for many years not just 2, but at least 5 years. Yes it is heavy to lug around and carries a steep price tag of US$1500 including Canon's nice 28-135mm image stabilizer lens but the image quality I get in return is something I don't want to miss any longer especially on my planned RTW trip.I recently took this camera on my trip to Honduras and returned with stunning images, that blow previous images from my advanced P/S cameras out of the water. I simply love the detail, colors and manual settings especially during sunset or action shots.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "A work horse", "Author": "James T. Walczak \"Lomitus\"", "ReviewID": "RT6AU059KMB3E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What can I say about the Canon 40D that hasn't already been written in dozens of photography magazines and web forums?  Probably not a whole lot! LOL!!!  If you are seriously considering this camera, chances are you are already familiar with the brand if not the model by now so I will just highlight the things I've found useful and the things I have found annoying about this camera (and YES, there are some things I've found annoying).First let me say that for a \"mid level\" DSLR, the piece of equipment is, as my review title states, a serious work horse.  Having stepped up from a Canon Rebel XT, which was a great DSLR in it's own right, I was quite impressed with the quality, both of the camera itself and the images it creates right out of the box.  My first gripe however is that after using my XT for a while, I found the 40D to be rather bulky and cumbersome.  If you are just stepping up to a \"pro\" level camera from something like a regular point & shoot or if you are like me and simply have small hands (or as in my case, both!), this is something to be aware of.  The best analogy I can give is to be used to driving a small compact car like an old Chevy Chevette and suddenly finding yourself behind the wheel of a '56 Buick Roadmaster!  It's large, it's heavy and it feels rather awkward.  Personally I also find having the info LCD on the top of the camera instead of the back of the camera to be...well...stupid.  I really don't like having to stop and \"tilt\" the camera upwards just to read my settings.  There is a button on the back to use the rear screen for this, but it's an extra step to have to do it...I thought the lay out of the Rebel XT was much nicer in this regard.Now as I said, the image quality this camera produces makes the annoyance of the camera's size and poorly placed info LCD well worth dealing with.  Even with my \"cheap\" third party lenses, the images that have come off this camera have been superb.  I've cropped images at close to 100% that have still been very printable.  Also I shoot in mostly Aperture Priority mode and I've found the camera to be pretty much right on the nose most of the time.  Speaking of crops, another thing to be aware of is that this camera does have an APS-C sized sensor (NOT full frame) so there is aprox a 1.6x crop factor involved with the lenses.  Not a complaint mind you, but something to be aware of.  Please note however this IS just a crop and not an actual zoom factor...and there IS a difference.And speaking of \"IS\"...this leads me to my second gripe.  If you are already familiar with Canon, then you should know by now that they have not yet started to incorporate IS or \"Image Stabilization\" into their DSLR's the way many of the other camera makers have.  As such, you usually have to pay a great deal extra for this feature as most Canon IS lenses are rather expensive.  In fact with the exception of a couple of recently introduced EF-S models, Canon IS lenses start around $600 and the sky is the virtual limit compared with many other brands with many of their lenses costing several thousands of dollars.All and all, this is a great camera but it's not \"perfect\" in the way some Canon aficionados would have you believe.  Another minor gripe was that moving up from my XT I had to purchase new spare batteries all over again as the \"Rebels\" and their higher end counter parts use different batteries...even though both are Li-ion.  The same is true of many of the accessories as well...I had to get a new remote, the vertical grips aren't compatible, etc., etc..  If you already own a Rebel, this is something to be aware of as you'll have to replace all of these accessories that you've already shelled out cash for!Now after reading this I'm sure you're asking, \"With all these issues, is it worth it?\" and the answer is yes.  I've gotten shots with this camera that simply would not have been possible with anything else I've ever owned (digital or film).  The focus is fast and accurate, I've had no compatibility problems with any of my lenses (although I do have one fussy flash unit from ProMaster that still won't work with it) and once you get used to it, this camera has a lot of very useful features, such as Highlight Priority, etc..  If you already own Canon EOS gear (remember, this bugger won't work with FD equipment) then it's a very worth while upgrade considering the price drop.  If you don't need the high ISO's of the new 50D or the full frame wonders of the 5D Mark II, then the 40D is a wonderful investment and should serve you well for many years.", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "novice photographer", "Author": "CC \"CC\"", "ReviewID": "RF9RZG0T22P8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read many reviews on amazon before purchasing this camera and its one of the best purchases I've ever made.

After using the camera with the kit lens I'm convinced the lens is very good. The lens sells for about $400 but with camera, it only adds $200. I also bought the Sigma 10-20mm lens from Amazon and this lens is great for ultra-wide angle photos. It really completes the set of lens I'll need.Now, for the camera, I think its fantastic. Its got a solid magnesium alloy body and looks and feels more expensive than it is. It's got all the features you would want including Live View which can come in handy at certain times. The 10.1 megapixels is an improvement over the Digital Rebel at 6.3 megapixals. The camera is very fast at 6.5fps compared to the rebel's 2.5fps. The rebel can only take 4 pictures until the memory catches up but the 40D can take up to 75! That is really good.Another thing I love is that the camera displays the iso in the viewfinder and the LCD info screen. That is very handy compared to the Rebel. The 40D is the first prosumer SLR to have a 3\" screen. The screen does not have as many pixels as the Nikon's new D300 but that camera cost's about $500 more.Are the pictures that much better than the Rebel? Not really. The Rebel takes phenomanal photos but you just won't be able to enlarge as much. You won't have the control on the Rebel as you will the 40D.Is it worth upgrading? I say yes because I have had the Rebel for almost 4 years now and this new 40D will probably be the last SLR I'll have to buy (unless it breaks). 10.1 megapixels is way plenty and more would be redundent so hopefully this is the last camera I have to buy.Hope this review helps you decide.", "Date": "September 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great mid-range SLR for heavy duty", "Author": "Michael Sandman", "ReviewID": "R395JO53JKY20L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why would you buy this camera when you can buy a Canon 400D or Nikon D40x for about half the price?  Or: Why would you upgrade from your current Canon 20D or 30D?The 40D is more than halfway up the scale that starts with smaller, lighter, plastic-body single lens reflexes like the Canon 400D or Nikon D40x and goes up to the amazingly capable and tough cameras used by professionals.  The 40D is a lot less than halfway up the price scale, so depending on how much you use your camera and what kinds of photography you do, you could consider it to be a bargain.  If you plan to haul your camera around a lot, you'll like the strong all-metal body, despite the added weight and size.  If you want to get the most out of Canon's full-featured external flash guns, you'll like the integrated flash control capabilities.  If you want to take a series of photos very quickly to get the best shot of a sports event or a child's facial expressions, you'll like the ability to rip off 8 shots a second.  If you want to take photos at night or macro photos - extreme close-ups -- you'll like the ability to flip the mirror up to get the steadiest possible shots on a tripod.But if you don't think you'll ever use a tripod, you probably don't need this camera.If you're thinking about upgrading from a Canon 20D or 30D, the 40D has worthwhile improvements.  I upgraded from a Canon 20D.  I've taken about 1000 photos with the 40D and I'm quite pleased with the improvements.  The most useful are the much larger LCD and the \"live view\" feature.  The big LCD makes it a lot easier to judge the shots you've just taken, and it's brighter and more easily visible in sunlight than the LCD on the 20D and 30D.  (On the other hand, it doesn't have more pixels, so the shot is not as crisp as one would like.)  Live view lets you use the LCD instead of the viewfinder (which you can do with any inexpensive digital camera).  That means you can frame and focus easily when you're taking a photo from a very low angle, as you might if you're doing macro photography. And it's great in crowds because it allows you to hold your camera up over the heads of the people in front of you and still see what your camera sees.The 40D also has a more user-friendly menu than the 20D/30D, and you can specify up to 3 custom settings that allow you quickly change to a combination of aperture, speed, ISO, and other settings that you use frequently. The 40D also has a built-in mechanism that shakes dust off the sensor.  (The sensor on the 20D didn't seem to attract a lot of dust, but I'm pretty careful when changing lenses.)If you buy the camera in a kit with a Canon lens, be careful about what lens you buy.  Remember that cameras in this category - under two grand - have sensors that are smaller than the frame of a 35mm camera. Therefore, if you use a 50mm lens, the camera's field of focus makes it look like you're using an 80mm lens.  (Multiply the lens' focal length by 1.6 to get the effect on a 40D, 400D, or any of the Nikon equivalnets.)The 40D may be bundled with an inexpensive 18-55 mm lens that's pretty basic and covers the same range as a 28-80mm lens on a regular film SLR.  That's a very usful range -- wide angle to modest telephoto.  Or you can get a 17-85mm image-stabilized lens that has a very useful range - equal to 27 - 135mm.  But the images need some work on your computer to correct distortion if you're making enlargements of wide-angle shote.Or the kit may include a 28-135mm image stabilized lens that acts like a 45-215mm lens on these \"1.6 crop factor\" cameras.  As such, it doesn't have enough a wide angle range suitable for landscapes or photos of groups of people.  Of the three, I'd choose the 17-85mm.  But if your budget can handle it, consider buying the 40D body and adding the excellent Canon 17-55mm image stabilized (\"IS\") f/2.8 lens, which has to be purchased separately.  You might also consider the much less expensive Tamron 17-55mm f/2.8 (which lacks stabilization and is not quite as good as the Canon 17-55.)If you already have a Canon SLR and an additional lens with a Canon mount, it's a no-brainer to consider the 40D.  But if you're buying your first SLR, do take a good look at the Nikon D80 or the Nikon D300, which is more expensive but which has some nice features.

This is an excellent camera.  Only upgrade that it lacks & I wish it had is in camera lens correction. The camera is very fast. It easily takes 6+ frames a second.  Auto focus is very fast also, even in less than perfect light. You'll be able to use for virtually all sporting events.  But it also has good depth & coloration for landscapes, portraits, etc. AND don't let the ONLY 10 megapixel issue throw you. Although 10mp may seem light compared to the newer models, I believe that is one of the reasons the camera is so good at processing light.  The pixels are less compressed on the sensor and really seem to pick up light much better than some of the newer camera's.  And you will find that the 10mp is more than you'll need even if you like to crop your photo's several times or blow them up large enough to frame & hang on the wall.AND the biggest plus?  This camera is a bargain right now.  With the new 7D & 50D out, people are unloading this model very quickly.  If you want a camera to use for several years, try this one & take the money you'll save and buy a couple of very good PRIME lens.

I haven't regretted my choice.I am a rank novice and know little about digital photography but this camera will help you immensely with its many program modes. The wonderful thing about digital photography which has been mentioned many times, you take a bad picture you erase it. And its so true. Study your manual and experiment and you will be taking wonderful photos before long.The 40d is bigger than the Rebel and much studier. It's body is magnesium alloy which makes it heavier but its not objectionable. This is a \"crop camera\" with a focal factor of 1.6. This helps with telephoto but wide angle hurts as it magnifies your focal length by 1.6. It accepts both EF and EF-S lenses.I will give you an example. I bought the camera in November 2007. This February a co-worker and friend asked me to come to their daughter's wedding just to take snapshots. They had hired a wedding photographer. I said I will but I didn't know how the pictures will turn out as I was still learning how to use the thing. No matter they said, we have a photographer hired anyway. I took the camera, the 28-135 kit kens and a 580EX II Speedlite. I let the camera and the flash make most of the decisions concerning settings and using techniques I had remembered from my film SLR days I made about 175 various shots. Never done a wedding in my life. To my amazement the majority of the shots were great. So much so the parents of the bride told me that my snapshots were on par with the professional they had hired. No not all were good. There were lighting miscues. The reception was under florescent lighting and I overlooked that fact with camera settings. Post processing helped a lot.All in all I am very pleased with this camera and would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a digital SLR camera that is not a full frame camera. One other point, if you have a Nikon or a Canon camera look into DxO post processing software. It matches the particular camera body and particular lens to process the image. It is a great program especially if you shoot with the RAW format.Bob James", "Date": "March 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "WORTH THE WAIT", "Author": "K.

The flash and the camera are in constant communication and flash keeps up very will with the high-speed continuous shooting of this camera.  The camera has been fun to learn, but it is similar enough to other Canon products that the learning curve is not steep.I compared this camera to the Nikon D300 and had a hard time deciding between the two.  What it came down to was the sensor itself.  Nikon is a great name, but they don't make their own sensors (yet).  Sony makes the DSLR sensors for Nikon, and if I wanted a Sony camera, I would just buy a Sony.The only feature I wished it had was a full-frame sensor, but none of the cameras in my price range had this.

Its tough magnesium body houses a brilliantly arranged 10.1 mega pixels, Digic III processor, 2.5\" LCD monitor, CF size card, self-cleaning sensor, terminals (for pc, video out, remote control, and digital down load), a mode set dial (that includes \"basic zone\", \"creative zone\", and 3 \"custom user\" settings), along with a multitude of the usual Canon SLR functions and features (1.5\" LCD function panel, auto focus button, red-eye detection, access lamp, shutter priority, pop-up E-TTL auto flash with AF-assist beam, etc.).  The 40D hosts all EOS lenses, TTL and EX series \"Speedlites\", and is powered by the long-lasting BP-511A rechargeable battery.This formidable camera takes clear and brilliant photos up-close (within a few inches) and far a field (with a 300mm).  The Digic 3 is fast, allowing this SRL to take up to 5 shots in 1.5 seconds!  (I find myself taking 12-20 snaps with every pose thus presenting several choices for printing.)The novice \"photo bug\" might find the EOS series complicated (with several dials and buttons).  Someday, technology will adjust the mirror for live view monitor usage with every setting (and not just in the \"creative zone\").

Sensor cleaning2.) Live View3.) A big jump in megapixels from my 10D4.)

Going from 8 megapixels (if you have a 20D or 30D) may not be that noticable, but from 6 megapixels to 10 is noticiable for cropping.The Canon 40D is also quick to focus and is good in low light.

It has never failed me when it comes to professional, high quality images.  I am a professional photographer, and this beauty has helped me win over clients, time and time again.  I started off with the EOS Rebel xTi, and within a year, had outgrown it, and was torn between the 40D and the 50D for my upgrade.  Hands down, the 40D was the only choice for me.  I still carry my xTi as a backup to weddings and photo shoots, but as of yet, have never had to even pull it out of my bag.It required some updates within the first year, which Canon notified me of and was able to do remotely, but I have had no problems with this great camera the entire time I have had it.I have taken this camera all over the US, ranging from Vegas to Maine, to beautiful Belize, and even on a cruise to 7 ports of call, so it has been on many trips with me, from beaches to the amazing Myan Ruins, and with all the banging around and traveling, it stood up strong and held its head high.  What a trooper this lil beauty is!  I will be taking it with me to Alaska later this year, because I only want the best shots when it comes to that beautiful location.Speaking of traveling, the 40D is much heavier than other bodies such as the xTi.  I prefer a heavier camera, because it appears it results in clearer/sharper shots, and then even better balance proportion with my IS lenses.  But having smaller hands, this camera fits perfectly in my fingers, and feels really good to me.  But if the weight might be a problem to you, (arm fatigue), you might want to check out the body in store before purchasing.I just ordered my first P&S;, and I got the S95 (again, I AM a self proclaimed Canon girl)  :) and I am looking forward to receiving it.  I paired my 40D with the battery pack, and so when going on trips, carrying my short and zoom lenses, flashes and such, my bag was just too cumbersome, so I decided to get a little sidekick to bring with me instead, and to carry around with me at all times, which I cannot do with my 40D.  We are heading to New York soon, and I already feel a little sad about leaving my faithful companion at home, but it will be interesting to see how it feels to only have a little one piece p&s; to travel with me.I absolutely love the sensor cleaning that automatically occurs when you power on or off.  I also enjoy the ability to shoot in both RAW and .jpg form.  The output of images on this camera are absolutely amazing.  Somehow I managed from time to time to let my 40D out of my hands to some stranger (choke!) to take our photos, after I put the camera on AF and even then the photos came out amazing!  I have only done this a handful of times, because sadly I just don't trust people these days when it comes to nice equipment.  The large clear quality that the 40D puts out really make me realize even after all these years that this was the best choice I could have ever made, especially paired with Canon's amazing L IS lenses.I have no experience with the Live View, as I always use the viewfinder (even though I get nose prints on my LCD screen from time to time lol)  I use my camera daily, and even though I have two batteries for it, I only have to charge up once a month or so.

I looked for a seller that had some reviews I could read/evaluate and paid close attention to the star ratings.

This little gem of a camera has impressed me since I opened the box.I've owned a 10D, 30D, 1D classic, XTi Rebel and now this beauty. I had a hard time deciding on the 40D or the 50D but after a couple of days of research, I decided on the 40D kit with the 28-135. This feels great in the hand and if you buy the battery grip it feels even better. I use portrait mode about 50% of the time or more so the grip was a no brainer for me. If you own larger lenses, it makes sence to have something like the grip to help balance out the weight.The reason I decided to buy this instead of the 50D was a little complicated. I shoot RAW files except for family candids so the smaller file size was a must. The high ISO noise on this camera is actually better than the 50D and I wasn't too interested in the super high ISO feature on the 50D. I don't need an HDMI interface that the 50D provides so, the 40D was the best option for me. The camera allows you to customize your settings and gives you 3 different selections on the mode dial just for those custom user settings. Menus are easy to use and understand. I've probably only used the manual once for something very minor.The lens was another thing...I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. Don't get me wrong, it's no L series lens but it's a keeper in my book. The biggest down side to the lens is that the camera itself has a 1.6x crop factor so you're not getting true 28mm on the wide end. When you compare it to a 35mm negative slide, you're getting actually 44.8mm on the short end. Some people find this isn't wide enough. I'm still undecided on that for now. The good thing is, if you find it's not wide enough for you, you can always sell it on Ebay for around $300 USD and buy a wider lens. I'm still considering this. It is, however, a great walk around/general purpose lens. If you're using it outside in good light, the small aperture isn't an issue. You can still stop it down a good bit before having to bump up the ISO and with the IS, you still have some help with camera shake. The colors and contrast are rather good and image sharpness is ok in the hands of an expierenced photographer.Overall, I'm truly happy with my purchase.

In fact, in the sub-$1000 range, I don't think you could possibly buy another one.  I checked three or four of the leading photo magazines and e-zines....and they all rave about this baby.  And I have to say, I agree.I use to shoot for fun with my old Canon AE-1, which started back in high school in the late 80's.  That camera eventually broke a few years ago, and I gave it away to someone who could fix it.  Since then, I've tried to scrape by with a few cheapies, but they were not the kind of camera that made you really want to go out and take pictures.Then I started borrowing my uncle's now-fairly ancient 10D, and the love of picture taking came back.The 10D-40D series are cameras that makes you want to take pictures.  That was probably the main reason I purchased the 40D over the Rebel 450D -- this one just feels so much more sturdy in the hands.  The higher resolution on the newer 450D (12mp vs. 10mp) really doesn't make a lot of difference for what I want to do.  The features on the 450D would have been plenty for my amateur photography, but it just didn't feel as nice to shoot with it.  If you are on the fence about 450D or 40D, my advice would be to go to a camera shop (or even a Best Buy, which usually has both on hand) and 'feel' them out for yourself.  When I did it, the feel just wasn't there for 450D.This is a great kit deal too with the 28-135mm lens.  Don't mess around with any kits selling you the ultra-low end 18-55mm kit lens, and please don't buy the 40D and then drop another 170 bucks on a cheapie lens.  That's like sticking a Mazda Miata engine inside a Corvette.  But the 28-135mm is no cheapie.  This is 400 buck lens going for 150 less in the kit.  The USM (ultra-silent motor) and IS (image stabilization) features make the 28-135mm a very nice, very versatile lens for starting out.  The expense is not that much more than 18-55mm, but it's totally worth it in the long run.  So if you are just starting out, this is definitely the best kit to go with.As always Amazon shipping is amazing.  I ordered the thing on a Monday morning, added standard shipping (8 bucks extra), and the thing was at my doorstep the very next day.  Unfortunately, I ordered my CF card through Newegg (which has a pretty good shipping reputation!), and so I had to wait another 2 days before that arrived.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Upgrade from 30D", "Author": "D_Sone \"Sone\"", "ReviewID": "R10BIRSNAKDYBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is an excellent upgrade from the EOS 30D.

I admit this was maybe a little crazy but this is an approach I sometimes will take to shop for features, fit and function and then roll the price into the analysis on the last step. I had no existing buy in to an existing brand or any inventory that I needed to be compatible with. This left me free to look at Nikon, Pentax, Sony, Canon and a couple of others that escape me now. I actually think that almost any of these brands have fine products. I am convinced they all have marketing departments that are professionals at price pointing and feature trade offs. Plus my local camera shop buyer knows how to buy and make sure he covers all of the price points.So after going through abut 8 models all lined up on the counter I ended up selecting the Canon 40D. Here was my rationale at the time. Most of the models in this price area have remarkable similar features and prices with the end result being there are pretty simliar. So with the feature, function, price trade offs being relatively equal I decided on the Canon 40D. This camera fits my hand better than any other model regardless of maker. It also at 6+ frames per second was faster than any other camera without REALLY ignoring price.Now that I have had the camera for a while there are more reasons to own it then the sales rep was able to pass on at the time of sale. The build quality is just awesome and there are more options for controlling the 40D than I had a clue about. Another thing I discovered are the Canon L series lenses. I now have two of the F2.8 zooms each of which cost more than the camera. So in the future I am bought into Canon camera bodies but the 40D and the L lenses produce stunning results. So for me the fit and function were just right and the future is bright (F2.8 at 200MM). So if you think you will add lenses to your bag I would put that into any camera body decision.

I strive to use the manual \"creative\" zones more and more but when I need to take a quick shot it is easy to quickly switch to the auto mode (either full or Program AE) to ensure I do not miss anything.The instruction manual is easy to use, thorough and small.  It makes a good \"take-along\" reference guide if you are using a dSLR for the first time.The screen is big and bright providing accurate color representation and preview of your shot. (zooming function helps to determine the sharpness of the shot)  The camera is a bit larger than comparable dSLR's, but it has a solid ergonomic feel with a thoughtful button and user interface design. Also, while the live view function is a \"nice-to have\" in the dSLR realm, I have found it invaluable in taking family/group pictures while staging the camera for the shot.

After much research, including the reviews by others here on Amazon, I decided to go with the EOS 40D.For me there was a toss-up between the XSi and the 40D, but what pushed me in the 40D direction was ultimately the size of the camera.  I'm a big guy.  When I held an XSi in my hands it just felt too small.  The 40D felt just right in my hands.  Another motivating factor was the kit lens.  The EF 18-135 is far better than that which comes with the XSI.After spending a week with the camera, I can say that I am fully satisfied.  It takes great pictures and allows me a large degree of creativity.  With the camera I ordered a guidebook that is helping a lot.  As for the pictures, they have very little noise.

And it was the same with the Canon 40D. I was debating between the 40D and the 5D. The 5D was substantially more expensive, but I really wanted the a full-framed camera. The 5D has been around for a couple of years and the new refresher model will be out around Q3 08'with better features and functions. I just couldn't wait that long per I had a few travel plans this summer that needed the camera. So the decision was made to go with the 40D.This camera is amazingly fast with the DigicIII processor and 6.5 frames per second. The live view function helps a lot for those moments when you can't view the shot through the view finder. With a 3\" screen it makes viewing on the live view mode simple to see the details. The autofocus in live view mode is also accurate and clear (you need to push the autofocus button near the right thumb for it autofocus; pushing down halfway on the shutter button to autofocus does not work for live view). For the price, this camera is a bargain with all the high-end function it has.The grip, weight distribution and overall feel of the camera is very solid and gives you a great balance for any shot.I would highly recommend this camera for people that are upgrading from a XTi or considering to go into photography.

The sensor cleaner is an added bonus.Live View is new and innovative - although it only works with manual focus. It isn't a feature that is going to help the day to day hand-held shooter, but for those occasional tripod shots where you want to see your composition or adjust your composition before shooting, its innovative and helpful.The weight and \"feel\" of the camera are just about perfect -- things have good weather sealing, the heft of the camera feels good in your hand, and it feels substantial. Much better than the plastic-feeling Rebel series.A great camera for advanced amateurs as well as professionals who want a light, fully-featured dSLR. Beginners can shoot out of the box, but will be overwhelmed by all of the features.One of the things that I would always use to recommend an advanced Canon over the Nikon's is their inclusion of the creative zone and basic zone features even on their advanced cameras. For those quick sports, landscape, or nightshot photos, its a breeze to flick the dial and shoot.Highly recommended. Note that you might not like any of the kit lenses. The 28-135 doesn't have enough focal length, and the standard 18-55 doesn't have sufficient low-light capability.

I have spent about three weeks shooting with this and have no regrets with this purchase.The set up is made for simplified shooting with all the essential options always right at your finger tips, rarely needing to spend time scrolling through the menu screen. Also they make it easier to scroll through the menu screen by having short cuts to different parts of the deeper menu, again to save time in a shoot. The live view, which I have rarely used so far, can be very usefully to get an accurate idea of what the picture will look like before snapping it. One thing that I did like that was offered in this canon model, and kept me from buying a Nikon D90, was the fact that I could easily change the focus point without going through the menu screen.The body is rugged, being made from the magnesium alloy. I have not dropped it yet, but my friend who has the same model, has quite a few times, with no damage to it. The 3 inch screen is perfect for reviewing your shots. Can change the brightness and zoom in to clarify any details. And did I mention that this model can shoot in 6.5 FPS, with the 10.1 MP Senor, resulting in crisp photos. Right now I have mine set to shoot RAW and can take up to 17 continuous with my Kingston 8GB x133 CF Card. Very good quality for the price.The pictures I have taken, I am extremely happy with so far. And know that this model has so much more potential. I have used a variety of lenses, all giving exceptional result. If you purchase the EF mounts, you are able to upgrade to a higher model and not have to buy new lenses to go along with those models. Another note, I did notice, that if you do switch from manual focusing to automatic focusing or vice versa, that it is a single switch, while on the Nikon D90, there is a switch on the lens and then a switch on the body, losing valuable time, that could make the difference in getting the shot or just missing it.It is a very good buy, if your looking for a relative inexpensive, yet professional model.

It is my second camera (my first camera is Pentax k100). It is big, solid and tough. I thought Pentax K100d is quite big, but it is nothing compare to this 40D. The grip is very ergonomic. I feel confidence handling it.Body and controlThe built quality of Canon 40D is excellent. It is made from magnesium alloy body. It is weather seal as well. It is made to withstand plenty of abuse. I dropped the camera once to the ground, and it still performs like new. I think entry level camera such as Rebel XSi would not able to withstand it.Canon 40D has many buttons and two main dials. The first dial is thumb dial, located near shutter button. The second one is the big round dial located at the back of the camera. I especially like the round dial. I usually change aperture, view photo, choose menu using this dial. To access live view mode, I simply push the button in the center of the dial.ISO and Auto ISOThe ISO range starts from 100 to 3200. The auto ISO range is from 100 to 800. I hope it is 100 to 1600. 40D handles noise very well up to 800. You will see more noise creeping in at 1600. At ISO 3200, the image quality is unacceptable. The Auto ISO is the biggest disappointment for me. It tends to stick at ISO 400 most of the time.LCD ScreensCanon 40D has two LCD screens, the main / back screen and top LCD screen. The top LCD screen is clear in the dim light condition such as indoor or evening, but not clear in the bright daylight. To solve this problem, you can use accessory called Hoodman. The top LCD screens is helpful to check out camera settings at any time and any circumstances. It has green light lcd that could be turned on if necessary.Auto Focus SystemCanon 40D has 11 AF points, distributed in diamond formation. The speed of AF will depends on the lens. Lens that have USM (Ultra Sonic Motor) is generally perform faster than non-USM, but some lenses like Canon 85mm f/1.2 USM AF are quite slow because of the complicated lens elements. Some lenses are also better in tracking subject than other.Favorite featuresThere is a feature called Highlight tone priority. I think it is a great feature because it protects the highlight from over exposure. It is great to use for portraits, wedding, landscape and so on.The shutter has a distinctive noise. It sounds very professional. This camera can also shoot up to 6.5 fps which is great features to capture fast moving object.CompetitionBecause this camera is more than two years old now, it has many cameras that match or surpass this camera in term of its specifications. For example Canon 50D which has high-res LCD screen, higher image resolution and better Auto ISO. Nikon D300 is superior regarding AF system. It has 51 points and better tracking system.There is also Nikon D90 which has hi-res 3 inch lcd screen, cleaner image in high ISO speed but slower continuous speed and worse built quality. Read controversy regarding Nikon D90 vs Canon 40D.ConclusionThis is a very good camera suitable for either professional or amateur photographer. The size might be a bit too big for casual shooters, but after a while you might use to it. The image quality with the kit lens is good, but I recommend to get a higher quality lens to get maximum quality. Even it is more than two years old now, this camera is still capable and robust for you if you can live with its limitation (hint: Auto ISO and LCD screen.

My wife likes to take pictures, but really just wants to pick up the camera and push the button.  For that all she has to do is turn the aforementioned knob to the \"green square\", and the camera functions just like a point and click.  She gets fantasitc quality pictures with just the push of a button.Now when you really what let the camera fly, turn that knob to Tv, Av, or M and hyde comes out to play.  Once in one of these modes you have complete control over the camera settings and can be as creative as you are brave.  6 frames per second is enough to catch your kids doing almost anything, catch birds mid flight, and a variety of other actions shots.  You get a large volume of shots, and because it is digital, keep only the ones you want.With the intro of the 50D the 40D has become more affordable, and even with the kit lens will blow away any point & click.

The camera takes great pictures and is very fast. I love the way the camera is almost instantly ready as soon as you turn it on. I have not been able to notice any lag or delay between shots.  The 40D has many automatic modes that will take a great picture for you. There are also creative and a manual mode  for the more advanced people that buy this camera. As well as three presets that you can program manually to suit your common picture taking needs. The battery has a very long life span. You can take hundreds of pictures on a single charge. Having a spare battery with you is always a good idea and worth the price.  If you're considering purchasing this camera you can't go wrong with this camera. I give it a big thumbs up.

It's got to do with the thumbnail Canon uses to display the pictures.  Another gripe is bracketing only goes to -/+2 EV and 3 shots.

As with most consumer grade digital SLRs, the 40D has a 1.6x field of view crop factor, so the 28-135mm lens is more like a 45-215mm lens on a 35mm film camera. This is an excellent range for taking portraits and people shots, and makes a great 'everyday' lens. However, it lacks the wider angles that you may want for scenery, and for indoor party/group shots. (I am looking for a wider angle lens now to handle those requirements). Lastly, and this is by far the worst thing i have to say about this lens: it does not have a lens lock... when you are walking around the lens tends to point down, and gravity causes the zoom to slowly extend all the way.

I've been drooling over the 40D for like 6 months! Now that I have it, I see I was not idealizing it. It's every bit as wonderful as I imagined. Sure the D300 might be a little better in terms of specs and perhaps even with noise (I've never tried one, so I can't verify that), however, if you can catch a 40D during one of Canon's rebate sales (eg: right now), I think the price difference is very substantial. the 300 does for aroun $[...] body only. The 40D, with the rebate is less than $[...] WITH the kit lens, which is decent--it ain't no L--but for a kit lens it's pretty darn good!More about the 40D specifically:The live view function is a great boon. I find myself in all sorts of shooting situations where getting my eye to the viewfinder just ain't happening (low to the ground work, for example). Also, the 5x and 10x zoom is SO useful. I do a lot of professional portrait shooting, and this feature has rocked my world. What you see on the screen is simply much bigger than any viewfinder, and combined with the ability to zoom in on any area of the image to check your focus--I don't shoot portraits with a viewfinder anymore! (Note: you should use this technique on a tripod, preferably with a shutter release)Image quality is what you would expect--absolutely beautiful.14 bit A/D -- despite what people say--this makes a difference.The software for controlling the camera via computer is cool--I don't own a laptop so I don't get the most from it, but when I do get one eventually, I think I will use this capability a lot!Anyway, it's a great unit. Feels good in the hand, well built, well featured.My only reason for giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because I wish it's pop-up flash had a commander mode like the Nikon DSLRs. Instead, you have to shell out $200+ for a clunky transmitter that you have to stick in your hot shoe. OR you could buy a 580EXII, and use that for your transmitter.

I won't go into a detailed writeup since pleanty of other people have already done so. Here is a quick summary of the strong points and weak points of this camera.Strengths:* 6 FPS - Fast enough for photojournalism and sports on a budget.* Build qulity and ergonomics much improved from 20d, has a more solid  feel, and finger grip makes a big difference* Good color rendition.* Good sharpness and detail* Good high ISO noise. Not the same as the Mark III, but very good at  this price. I use 640 and 800 routinely, and the qulity is beyond what's required for the publications I shoot for, even without any noice reduction software either in camera or in post processing.* Live view. Despite the akward procedure for focusing, having any form of live view helps a lot when taking a very high or very low angle.* Highlight tone priority. It helps a little, a good extra.Weaknesses:* 'Weather sealing'. The foam strip on the card door is a joke, it should have had d200 level protection. Inexcusible, shame on Canon. I would have paid more for a big improvement here.* Screen. It's big, but not very accurate. Often isn't sharp enough for me to tell if I got the shot in focus or not. Color, brighness, contrast can look off too. Sometime shots look like garbage on the scree, but are fine in photoshop.* Plastic battery door hinge. They made the rest of the camera sturdier, yet cheaped out on this part to save $0.10. WTF?* Autofocus at 5.6 can be frustrating. When trying to get a bird through branches, it often misses even when the center dot is right on the bird.* Anit-dust. It makes little to no noticable difference. I change lenses often and the 40d sensor has as much dust stuck to it as my 20d did.Overall, it takes great images. There's always things they could have done better, but remember, you are only paying $1,100 for it so you can't expect the world.

Just the bigger viewfinder, second wheel, and really short shutter lag is enough for me to be extremely happy.  Noise characteristics are a lot better than xti, period.

I was initially very irritated, but I've had a couple months now to play with this magnificent camera.  This is an extremely well-built camera. I just shot an outdoor jazz concert at night hand held with no flash.  I needed to use ISO 1600 to get a decent shutter speed with the available lighting, and I was somewhat skeptical that my photos would be useful. I was amazed to find very little noticeable grain.  I only really noticed it in the shadows.  There's no way those images would have been usable on my 10D.The 10 megapixel sensor is more than enough for most any setting I can foresee (you can print 11x14\" or larger just fine). The antidust system works like a charm--I haven't had any problem with dust on my sensor.  The 3\" live view screen is an added bonus I hadn't counted on. It is much easier to see that my images are sharp.  The battery lasts for well over 500 exposures without using the internal flash.  It has 9 autofocus points that work both horizontally and vertically, making them very effective.I do have a few minor gripes, but they are very minor:1) There's this confounded print button that I'll never use, but there's no dedicated button for a mirror lockup.  It should be customizable (I think Canon has fixed this on newer cameras).2) The new picture style function is very nice, but not easy to use if you want to make your own settings.3) I wish Canon would spread out the AF points so that they are not so close to the center of the view finder.  If there were four closer to the \"rule of thirds\" they would be more useful.4) I have had an issue with using my external flash.  There's a very small  lever under one of the metal plates of the hotshoe.  When you remove an external flash, sometimes it gets stuck down.  If that happens, the internal flash will not pop up because the camera thinks the external flash is on.  You can pop that lever up with a pin and it's fine, but it's still a little annoying.If I had the extra money, I probably would have wished I had waited for the 50D.  From what I can tell, that's going to be a significant upgrade from the 40D.  However, at an additional cost of almost $500 (really, a 50% increase), I'm just not sure it's going to be worth it.

I particularly like the capability to shoot just RAW files. The 10MB file size facilitates enlargements w/o using 3rd party software. Also I like the capability to change the picture style.  The 10D doesn't have those features.  I set the camera to the neutral style with Aperture-Priority and have been getting great exposures. My primary zoom is the EF24-105mm F4L IS USM lens.  I have to get use to the 95% coverage looking through the viewfinder, but that's not an issue.

I have found no problems; all functions appear to work as advertised.  One word of advice: if you're accustomed to viewing the shot via the LCD, it CAN be done with the 40D, but is awkward.  Get used to using the optical (through-the-lens) viewfinder, like a film camera.  You can still see what you've just shot on the LCD screen, with adjustable viewing time.  Typical of Canon, this appears to be a fine camera, with features for the beginner through advanced photographers.  You can start out with \"point-and-shoot\" (automatic everything), and advance to as many manual settings as you like.  At this point, I recommend the 40D!  Be sure to buy a lens to match the quality of the camera; I suggest an \"L\" series lens.

You can do your own research, but after looking at the specifications of the 40D vs the XSi, there really wasn't a contest about which camera I was going to go with.

I read a lot of info here on Amazon and a few other places. I finally settled on looking at a used 40D. To my surprise there was a vendor here that sold the body for cheap because it was an open box. The body had never been used but the lens was missing from the kit.After receiving my 40D i couldnt have been more pleased. It was the right size and weight. Felt very well balanced in my hand especially with a large 70-200mm lens on it. My Rebel had felt toyish with that lens attached. The ISO speeds could go well over the 800 ISO i was used to with the rebel. I also dont seem to get as much noise at those high speeds.The live view is the feature that beat out the 30D, but i dont find myself using it that often. Id much rather just look through the viewfinder.Im also liking the large aperture wheel and its placement by my thumb. Much better than having to press a button while spinning the shutter wheel like on the rebel.All in all this was a great purchase.

The program modes are great on these cameras and allow some creativity (metering, drive mode, ISO) and also have manual modes for full creativity (within limits of the camera). I shoot mostly men's softball (afternoon, twilight, and evening lighting).  The FZ50 met some of my needs but the images too soft and I couldn't get the large appeture nor the rapid burst speed associated with the 40D.Right out of the box I wanted to see what the camera could do in the basic modes and found the images to be less impressive than my 4500, F30, and FZ50.  The reason is that the 40D does not allow for any changes to the pre-set programs.  It forced me to move right into the creative modes and use the features I paid for.It's very easy to use and figure out -nothing surprising.  It feels great in my hand (except that I had to cut my fingernails, ugh!)and the buttons  and adjustment wheels well placed.It's a great camera -I just think the lack of my photography skills prohibit me from working the camera to it's potential.

The XT has worked great but eventually it broke down (after any warranty was up) and gave the dreaded Error_99.  But enough about that, the 40D.For the purpose of the review all my comparisons will be the Rebel XT.  The first and most noticeable difference between the two is the weight and build quality.  The 40D has a metal construction which adds weight (not good for hiking) but also adds a great deal of confidence in is integrity.The menu system is vastly better than the XT because of dual wheels, this allows one finger to control the page and the other to control the item selected on each page.The other vast improvement is the way buttons are laid out.  That is, on the 40D everything you could possibly want is at your finger tips.  This means an increase in the potential shooting speed, but also is a steep learning curve as there are a lot of buttons.Finally the lens, the 28-135 IS is great.  Image Stablization allows you to get pictures with a shutter speed of 1/10 that look like 1/80.  This means that shooting in low light without a flash or tripod is possible.  The magnification is not amazing, but allows for decent pictures of average size flowers.

Recently, though, when Canon announced a $[...] rebate on the 40D, plus a $[...] loyalty upgrade rebate on top of that, I knew it was time to upgrade from my XTi to the 40D. WOW! Am I glad that I did!!! Although I loved my little XTi, the 40D is a COMPLETELY different animal! The move from a consumer DSLR to a prosumer DSLR is one that I was worried about, because of the perceived complexity, but the 40D is actually much easier to use because of the improved menu system and the dual LCD windows. Also, after holding the very-well-built 40D, the XTi now feels like a toy. Don't get me wrong, the XTi is one heck of a camera (I imagine the successor, the new XSi, is that much better). If you're thinking about the upgrade, don't think anymore, JUST BUY IT!!! If you're new to the world of DSLRs, though, I suggest buying an XTi or an XSi and learning its functions for at least one year, then upgrade. You can't just jump into the world of DSLRs from an all-automatic point-and-shoot. There's too much of a difference between these types of automatic-everything cameras and the DSLRs, which is why you should first learn with a less expensive DSLR and work your way up.

Morehead", "ReviewID": "R12AEP60M6UKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Things I really like...Live view.You can magnify the image on screen 10x's so checking focus is very accurate. Also, you can see the exposure change on screen while you are trying different settings. The same is true for white balance. Not sure which white balance to use? Put it in live view and try all the presets and see which one looks the most accurate. This is very helpful! Live view is also great for taking low level shots that wouldn't be possible if you had to look through the viewfinder. Also, it is great for overhead shots. Works great if you are in a crowd and cannot see your subject. It is also good for candid shots. Being able to take pics while not looking through the viewfinder helps you get very natural pics. (No posing or looking nervous that their pic is being taken) Also, Live view is 100% view. Very helpful! What you see is what you get.6.5 frames per second. You can get the exact shot you want when you subject is moving. Or, if you don't have a lot of light and you forgot to bring a tripod, fire away and one of your pics will be sharp. You will have to delete a lot of crappy pics but at least you will have one pic that is not blurry.Easy navigation through menus. The top knob goes from menu to menu and the wheel on the back goes up and down the menus. This is a very efficient way to do this.Auto ISOSometimes I use a higher ISO than I need to for low light situations. Auto ISO helps you choose the exact ISO you need. The lower the better.Comes with a cord to be able to look at your pics on a TV. I love using this to review photos before I download them to the hard drive. I get rid of the duds before they start taking up needless room on my hard drive.3 inch screen makes it much easier to read menus. Also, reviewing pics is easier. The screen is brighter than previous models so it is easier to see it in bright sunlight.ISO in viewfinder.Spot meter. (could be a smaller circle but this is not a huge deal)Low noise levels at high ISO's. It helps you get decent low light pics until you can afford the very expensive wide aperture lenses. Also, it helps you get more depth of field when the their isn't a lot of light to work with. ISO 3200 is surprisingly useful!Custom menus-saves time if you have to switch settings in a hurry.Highlight Tone Priority; It gives you more dynamic range. Less blown out highlights with very little downside. (It takes away ISO 100 and ISO 3200)Shutter speed 1/8000. Amazing!! You can use large apertures in very bright sunlight giving you a very shallow depth of field affording you more creative options. I took some hand held pics at this setting the other day and it looked like I used a tripod! I zoomed in a lot and the photo was very sharp.10 Megapixels. Leaves you lots of room to crop and still print big pics.Things I don't like...Flash must be used for auto focus assist in low light. It should have a separate light for this.View finder not 100% view. (but live view is!)White balance is not accurate for indoor lighting. I have to use an expo disc or gray card to get accurate colors inside. Apparently Nikon is better at this. Canon needs to catch up in this area.Having to purchase different focusing screens. The Nikon D300 comes with different focusing screens.The 40D not a perfect camera but it is a really good camera and the price is very fair. I enjoy using mine and the picture quality is excellent.

Though the price tag is high for people like me who are on a tight budget, it was well worth it in the end. It is worth visiting the Canon web site prior to purchase to be informed of the features and performace. I am trying to capture images of birds, often in flight and something capable of numerous continous shots was needed for me. This camera has that second only to the PRO line which would cost over $4,000.00. Once you own one, read the manual carefully, there are a lot of additional settings that passed me by until I carefully read the entire manual. Compared to some of the other SLRs that I have stood next to while photographing, this camera is noticably quieter though not silent.  This is a full size body (larger than the Canon Rebel XTI) and with the extended battery pack whick is worth purchasing for those (like me) who will do full day outings. You can also attach a hand strap that causes the right hand to feel like it is gloved; it eases the need to grip the camera so firmly during extended outdoor picture taking sessions. In addition for those who haven't tried the extended battery pack, it also has another shutter button, and quick function controls like the camera has in the shutter button area so you can hold the camera at the bottom (more naturally) while taking those vertical images.The lens that comes with this kit is very capable. I use the stablisation mode in most situations and have got great results. With the sensor being smaller than standard 35mm film (the 1.6X conversion factor) the 28mm will not seem wide enough of a view for some cases but other than that it does a wonderful job for the price.In RAW format, memory will be used up quick (compared to my previous 6mp camera) so I recommend 2GB memory cards or larger for RAW. With the price of memory cards finally dropping the average price; look for a good deal on cards with 120X (10MB)write/read speeds or higher. By doing so you will avoid holding this camera back and enjoy nearly no wait for the next shot whether you just shot single or a continuous serious of shots.

The more you use the LCD the less battery you have. But if you have a short preview time, the camera works just fine.The Live View Mode i think is not for me. In order to capture a photo i have to really prove that the object is in focus by playing with the focusin ring of the lens. The camera is not able to focus on a specific part of the scene by itself. For some users this might turn out to be a helpful way of shooting.In the end i am proud that canon released the 6.5 Frames per Second on this camera.

I am surprised with this lens after reading mostly negative comments. Personaly i have to say that is a very good lens. It focuses fast, no noise when focusing and it is a great range.

The Live View is perfect for tripod shooting, especially for shooting products where you can zoom in to pick up the textures of the product for extremely clear sharp focus.  The only downside at all of the camera is that I was expecting the Live View to operate like it does on my pocket camera.  NOT.  The auto focus DOESN'T work when in live view.  You have to push the AF button to have it focus THEN you can push the shutter button.  If you're shooting tripod composed shots - no problem.  If you're trying to shoot action shots using the Live View-well it just isn't going to work well for you.  Other than that, I love it.  The extra 1.5 shots/sec of the motor drive; the different options now available make the upgrade worth the few hundred I 'lost' when I sold the 30D.", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "The real 20D successor....", "Author": "Nomad77", "ReviewID": "R12HN5JDH6TP32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 20D was one of those camera's that set a standard in its days and even today it's still very good and more camera than most people will ever be able to to exceed.The 40D is a good and natural evolution.

Quite ergonmically designed, it holds and handles well, and has a very good set of features, including some very useful customization options.  It's probably the best camera at this price level if you are coming to digital SLR photography fresh (i.e., if you do not already have a lens collection, etc.).Having said that, if you are willing to spend more money, the Nikon D300 beats this one in many areas, such as the Auto ISO functions, the WB functions, and so forth -- but, as I say, it is significantly more expensive than the 40D, and also geared much more toward the more advanced prosumer market (the 40D, for example, has picture styles, which are preset shooting modes for different settings similar to what a point and shoot often has, but the D300 omits this kind of functionality in light of its intended core user of more advanced photographers).On the lens -- I was very disappointed in the lens.  The end of the lens was wobbly, it shook around easily and noisily when I moved the camera around, as did the distance meter.  When I extended the zoom, that went away (at least with respect to the lens body, but the old plastic-y feel is still there).  Beware that this lens also has a reputation for sucking dust into the camera.  It didn't take terrible pictures, but for a camera/lens kit of this price level, I didn't expect a lens that just felt cheaply put together.In all, if you are a Canon user and/or have a good stock of Canon lenses to use with this, it's a good camera body at the price.

This is a BIG camera - much larger than the XT or XTi. I like big because I have big hands and size doesn't come into play in a studio setting - unless maybe you are shoooting live moving models. Buy the XTi instead if you were/are used to the smaller size of a Canon AE-1 film camera.LIVE VIEW: My understanding is that the LiveView feature \"heats up\" the CMOS and thereby introduces noise into the shot. That issue detracts from the intended use of LiveView in Product Photography under hot lights while LiveView-ing on an LCD monitor - if anyone has other experience - please let me know. We are still getting familiar with the camera but we have put it through quite a few operational paces directly related to our business use.LOW LIGHT: We've yet to get it in the field for night photography tests but that is not an operational field for use for us - more at my hobby and art - but the blacks in our product photography are noiseless - unlike our Olympus C2500L.INTENDED USE: My purchase of this camera is strictly for the part of my business involved directly in a) Product Photography and b) Giclee printing. It fits into our workflow perfectly with Adobe CS2-3 and we won't be lookng back - we're glad to dump the film camera. My previous camera was an 35mm AE-1 Program film camera which is the same size as the Canon XT and newer XTi dSLR's. My other dSLR is an 8 year old Olympus C2500L which is about 2/3rds the size of an AE-1 and continues to be a fantastic digital workhorse camera for product shots intended for online catalogues or small image catalogues.LENS: The standard Canon EOS Kit lenses are generally various stages of horrible EXCEPT for the EF 28-135 IS USM Standard Zoom lens. This lens has decent reviews and it is a perfect walkaround (outdoor) lens - I was rather surprised to see that it had a 72mmm filter thread. One should consider getting that lens for the smaller XT or XTi models as the 40D isn't what I would call a walkaround camera body. A professional acquaintence uses the XT for outdor model photography, backpacking and city shoots and they are perfectly sized for such assignments. Most outdoor duty really only requires a consumer point and shoot model anyway.We can't help but be impressed and thrilled with the Canon 40D - unless the dreaded Canon \"ERROR-99\" should rear its ugly head (check forums on other EOS models). Oh, I should mention - 1) Only shoot in high-end RAW and 2) any dSLR capable of large RAW shots MUST be paired with a FAST (60x or better) flash memory if you intend to do ANY burst shooting.Good shooting!", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amateur Sports Photog--Thumbs Way UP", "Author": "Bruce F.

I've used the Rebel 35mm before this, and have been using pocket digital for 4 years.  Tired losing all sports images of my kids' incredible plays, I decided buy the Canon 40d.I used it for 2 games so far--one soccer, one football.  I kept the mode in the sports (little guy running icon on the rotary) mode.  I used it in cloudy conditions on day 1, bright sun on day 2.  Excellent results of absolutely stunning photos of the kids in action.  The image stab combined w/ extremely frames per second yeilds frozen shots that are amazing: eg: 6.5 FPS will allow you to push the button down about a second before a football punting situation, hold it down through the action, and have 6-12 photos of just before the kick w/ his leg 6 inches from striking the ball, then next will be his foot actually touching the ball, then the ball in the air away from his foot w/ the kicker in the air off two feet--flying if you will.  Great stuff, the kids love seeing themselves frozen in the air.  So, yes, this camera is fast and it makes a difference being 6.5 frames per second vs 3.5, in my opinion.  Just buy at least 2MB memory (gives 400 shots w/ max resolution, but at 10/event, you could burn through it in one game, believe me), I'd say the 4MB would be better.I just have been popping the memory card out and reading the photos directly into my computer, seems the easiest way to edit, plus doesn't run down the battery.  Battery has been good, hasn't run out yet on either day, though I didn't use the flash much.  Image Stab didn't take too bad of toll on it.The camera does many more amazing things, right now I'm looking into aerial photography.  Will update results, though I may need a stronger zoom.

In any rate, the machine has a great LCD screen, the controls and menus are easy to find and use and if you are familiar with Canon products it will not be all that hard to figure the machine out since controls are very similar in nature to the rest of the Canon products. The machine has an immense amount of features that I have not discovered yet but one of the features that I like the most is the \"live view\" feature which just like a point and shoot lets you preview the shot before you actually shoot it.

The high speed mode is so fast that I have to switch to the normal speed so I don't waste disk space all the time, and I am shooting raw+JPG on a SanDisk UltraII, not exactly the top of line disk. Comparing to my XT350D it's day and night. Canon seems to have solved the bottle neck of data communication between the camera and the disk once and for all! Feels like I can create an animation movie with this camera!- ISO 800/1600 is dramatically better than 350D, ISO1600 is very useful now. ISO 800 is favorably comparable to ISO400 on the 350D. In fact now I  found my old pictures from 350D@ISO400 to be annoyingly 'noisy'. Thought they were pretty clean before. This is especially true with the pics I took under indoor low lights.- Customizable settings, very helpful (But could use a lot more of these considering how awful the overall menu/button/switch combo are needed to get to the core functionalities! But I'd rather wish for a more streamlined redesign on Canon's part...) Just found out that I can't even add flash compensation to user menu. Only flash control group function can be added. But I only need the flash exposure compensation, the single humble item, not the whole group... This is only one example. (Site Note: Just read that 50D is better. Will I'll be stuck with my 40D for as long as I can I hope. For one thing, mega pixel counts only makes the file larger - more disk space, slower processing time. I am no pro and can't afford to print wall size spreads so the 10MB is fine with me.)- Works better with 580EX flash than my 350D XT, far better. 350D seems to have a hard time figuring out how much flash it needs in auto mood. Not 40D, fortunately.- Battery life is very long. I was fiddling with the camera all night last night, figuring out the settings and features, flashing shooing, deleting, shooing, changing settings. Not one bar was lost on the battery today!- Viewfinder is brighter and bigger, great! I can actually do some MF indoor with very little light!Neutral:- Build quality doesn't feel significantly better than my 350D, slightly maybe. The battery door is better, to a degree. The rubber pieces covering the USB/power/video are of questionable quality fit.Con:- No improvement on AWB in indoor lighting, still come out with odd looking color - awful. Flash solve the problem, but still awful.- Menu system is convoluted, too many buttons/switches and the combination of them to get to the things I need. Why the 3 position power switch, why in that awful location? (I know, that is Canon position, but still, why? Power up is so fast, but from that location? Also, the print button is useless, so is the joystick, not much joy to use, and not much use at all. If these switches have to be there, at least give them more work to do!) This really is a software design issue. Canon should hire some consultants from Honda/Toyota. The layout and functionality on a Honda/Toyota counsel is so much straightforward comparing to a Chevy or a Lincoln. Americans use to believe that is because the Japanese cars are cheap with fewer functionalities.Might have been somewhat true 15 years ago. But the real genius in those simplified straightforwardness prove to be true winner in the end. There's always ways to do things in a lot fewer steps. Under the current design, the customization functions are much needed, but only as a last resort, should never be a substitution for fixing the somewhat time-honored poor design from Canon. Many folks like myself are still with Canon because its line of lenses and 3rd parties support too. But that might change. When I saw Nikon's new offerings, I almost jumped the ship...- AE/over expose under bright sunlight, this is true with 350D as well. I sent my 350D for fixes back twice, and didn't fix the problem. Probably the problem lies in the hardware I am afraid rather than calibration. And too bad Canon only supports +-2 compensation. Under bright sunlight -1.2-1.7 seems to be about right for me.- Auto-dust cleaning system is not working for me. My brand new 40D got dust spots on my ocean view pictures already, and many of them. I didn't switch lenses often and I didn't shoot in dusty places. Canon should save the dust info into RAW so each pics can be digitally cleaned afterwards. As it stands, dust data collecting is not straightforward at all.- The LCD is big, but prove to smear and of very odd color. The resolution and color accuracy are simply not present. This probably was a cost cutting measure? Too bad. Bigger is not always better.- The new software pack is faster and more useful. But raw processing is still slow. And 40D is only a 10mp camera and 1Ds doubles that, imagine that! My PC is quite up to date with 2GB RAM. But I still have to use raw to get the real picture I intended. JPG is so often ruined by the AE/AWE problems beyond rescue.Bottom line:A very solid and useful DSLR has very strong features in speed shooting. But the old AWB and AE problem remain unsolved. The menu system is a nightmare. What happened to user-friendliness? Ease-of-use? Straightforwardness? Making complicated things simple is genius. The other way around? Well, call it whatever you want.40D is not the flagship, priced at $900+ is a bargain. But still, buyers of this group is not exactly in for the bargain. Just hope Canon can really solve the AWB/AE problems in the near future. Oh, a better LCD too. Bigger is not always better, so true here!", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera, lousy lens", "Author": "Richard C.

The lens in this kit is one of the worst made lenses I have ever seen.  When fully extended the front of the lens actually wobbles!  Looking through the viewfinder while the autofocus changes, you can see the image jump up and down as it shifts around.  Cheaply made.  You're better off buying the body only and opting for a better lens. Because of the conversion factor, the 28mm is closer to a 45mm - pretty useless.  You have to be around 10 feet away to fit a couple of people fully in frame!Followup: Have been using the camera for about three months. The package came with the 28-135mm lens - a really cheaply made, poorly assembled, waste of glass and plastic.  Front of lens wobbles over 1/8\" when in, just under 1/8\" when zoomed.  While trying to focus or zoom, the image shifts all over the place while the lens wobbles.Sent back to Canon for service.  Received it back three weeks later with a note stating that it was working according to specifications.Already called and read them the riot act.  They are sending a call tag for a re-evaluation. We'll see what happens.Bottom line - buy the body only and a better lens, not a package deal lens.More followup: The lens has arrived back from Canon with a note explaining that This time the note included stated \"The problem necessitating this repair is not covered by the limited warranty of your product\" and further notes that the lens is returned \"as is\" and has no warranty.  So Canon makes a defective lens, kind-of repairs it (It still wobbles, just not as much) then voids my warranty.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Incredible", "Author": "K.

I am also obsessed with Art Wolfe's photographs because they are diamonds!I was really considering buying a Canon Rebel XTI and did a lot of research about it. But when I picked up the canon 40d it just felt right! It's sooo much money though so I financed it and I have never been happier! I go out every weekend and shoot photos instead of going shopping or laying around the house!I have booked my first engagement photo session for $100 which will help me pay for the camera and I offered 100% refund if they didn't like it.So far it's been a trial and error with the camera. I have read through the canon book like 3 times in the past couple of weeks and it's really not that great unfortunately. It does explain how to get the different settings, but it doesn't explain what the settings do. I guess that is my fault because I really do not know what I am doing when it comes to photography but I wish there were more pictures in the book of \"this is what happens when you do this setting\". I'm a visual learner I guess.Luckily, I have been doing a lot of online research so it's slow coming. I wish I had a better sight because my lighting always seems off. Anyway! The main point of this is if you're thinking about the decision between this and the XTI, go with the 40d! My mom bought an XTI and has been wishing she had my camera because it just takes great pictures, the body is built strong, it's so much fun! there are so many settings and it's fabulous!One other thing, I went to a park the first week I got it and there was a pro photographer who has been doing it for like 20 years. He seemed REALLY upset that I had this cam and he didn't. He had a 30d and He was like \"You don't even know how to use that cam!\" It was kind of embarassing but it still made me feel good that I have such a wonderful piece of equipment. He told me that I should have waited for the 60d to come out but he said it will take me like 10 years to outgrow my camera.

After decreasing the sharpness level to \"2\", the ISO noise was greatly diminished! The reddish images were a result of the WB being set to Auto by default. After changing the WB to Daylight, my shots look more natural.ORIGINAL POST:I bought this camera because I wanted to upgrade from my RebelXT thinking there would be a major improvement in image quality; and after reading the stellar reviews here. The first thing I noticed after the first couple of shot was that images shot with the 40d were redder than the XT. I then noticed very high ISO noise levels on settings above ISO 200! I could not believe this, so I took some test shots with my XT and compared them to the 40D. To my surprise, the images shot with the XT at ISO-1600 looked better than the 40d images shot at ISO-200! In the 40d menu, I verified that Long Exposure Noise Reduction, and High ISO speed Noise Reduction were enabled. I really like the feel of the 40d, but to me, I need a camera that's going to produce virtually noise free images up to ISO-800.

This concerns this kit lens].Unfortunately, Canon has decided to include the 28-135 initially as the only kit lens.  While not a bad performer, this older, made for 35mm design, is not a good match for the high performance 40D.The 1.6 crop factor of the 40D makes the 28mm unacceptable to most for a wide angle solution.  Thus, you'll probably have to drop down additional money in the future for a wider-angle lens.  Although it costs more, the 17-85 IS is a very good solution that will give the majority of shooters all the wide angle they will need.  Yes, it falls short of the 135mm range, but that length, too, is probably not enough range at the top; therefore, you'd have to expect to buy 2 additional lenses.The one attractive feature of the 28-135 is the price.  Canon's definately taking a hit, trying to reduce their supply of this lens.  But by the time you read this, you might be able to get the just as afforable, new for digital, EF-S 18-55 IS.  This will help at the wide side, allowing you to put your additional money in the telephoto.Of course, if money is no object, look at the 17-55 f2.8 IS, or one of the many \"L\" series.Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon 40D", "Author": "Robert Herbert \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R28S1DDLYIAWAM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an upgrade from a Canon 10D.

I consider myself an amateur but with a decent amount of disposable income, and having outgrown the S2, the 40D was the next logical step in terms of moving to a DSLR, having cross-shopped it's predecessor the 30D and the Rebel XTi.The 40D's advantages over the XTi and 30D were considerable enough that I could justify the increase in price, and not feel like I had \"settled\" for something that I would later on regret.  Yes, the technology of camera bodies progresses so quickly that the 40D might easily become obsolete by this time next year, but at the same time there's enough in this camera that I think, for someone like me, it will be very hard to outgrow it.I will be using this camera mainly for photographing outdoor action, specifically automotive racing and events.  For me, the 6.5fps will be extremely important.  The live view is not a big plus for me, I don't foresee myself using that feature much.The amount of features can make the camera a little intimidating for a beginner.  If I was on a tighter budget, its very likely that I could have been content with the XTi, or Nikon's D80.  One thing that I am still having trouble getting used to is the inability to use the LCD as the viewfinder (except in live view mode, it's not really the same thing).  Also, at 10 megapixels, even the S-normal sized pictures come out huge.

Lum", "ReviewID": "R12A0BDDG5L5UQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is a good buy for the price.My major considerations were a Canon 450/ Xsi or Nikon D300.  The XSi is very similar.  Image quality is about the same, but the 40d is a faster camera.  The autofocusing felt a touch faster and it's got faster FPS with a better buffer.  The 40d is a bit heavier, but it also has a more solid feel in the hands.  If you're going to lug around a dSLR anyway, the weight difference is not a big deal IMHO.  The XSi has better live view capabilities (contrast-based focusing without the mirror going up), but the slow speed of that type of focusing will not make this like a point and shoot, so the advantage for taking everyday pictures is negligible.  For the small price difference, the 40d seemed like the way to go for me.The Nikon d300 is a generally better camera, but it's almost twice the cost after you get a VR lens (the smaller kit lens has no image stabilization).  The LCD is beautiful and sharp.  Focusing was rated as slightly slower in dim lighting according to a review site, but in the stores, I couln't tell much difference.  Both focused quite quickly.  Although there's more focus points on the d300, I prefer center-point focusing on my 40d anyway since I feel like I've got more control.  The higher ISO (6400) was tempting but I couldn't justify the high cost of the d300 for the relatively small advantages.  For those prices, I'd start considering full frame camers.  Also, your lens choices are a bit better with Canon.The 40d gets 3 stars from me. I got a few defective units (bad LCDs, broken cable release socket) and will have to send my camera to Canon.  Also, the pictures are a bit soft due to the AA filter.  I have heard that the Nikons are better in this respect, and one of my co-workers switched to Nikon because of this.  I know I will have to do a bit of sharpening in Photoshop when I shoot RAW.  Auto white balance is fair-poor, but this seems to be a universal problem with dSLRs.

I also thought that the \"Live View\" was way overdue and wrote that as a major complaint for the 20d, and 30d.  I wonder why it was that cheap sub-$100 canons had live views whereas a $800-$900 camera (at that time) didn't.  It opens up so many more options to give the user the ability to have that when they want it, for example taking pictures at a concert when you have to lift the camera over your head.  But the one thing holding me back from not giving this camera full kudos is that it's still relying on a sensor that crops your image. The same image that's taken w/ a 35mm film camera and this one wouldn't be the same.  This also changes the focal length of lenses and you need to do some math to get the right focal length, other than that there are some lenses that compensate for the cropping factor of this camera.  The only digital slrs that have the full frame are the 5d and up.  Those cost a little more.  I think canon should think about converting most of its digital slrs to full frame, as the technology's out there, so why are they holding back?

If you're going to use air paks, at least use enough to fill the airspace between the product and the box.  Mine looks like it could have accepted at least 18 more air paks.  Or, how about using something that won't/can't pop, like packing peanuts or scrap newspapers or something?  As it stands, the camera and all the other gear inside seem to be in perfect condition.  I even used Amazon's call back line and logged complaints with that department.  They just said \"it won't happen again\".  This was before I even explained just how poorly it was packaged, and they didn't even ask me to explain.  I subsequently ordered a camera bag from Amazon.  That box arrived crushed as well.  Most likely the fault of UPS.  But, knowing that UPS doesn't give a rats behind about boxes and if they get crushed, Amazon should take that into consideration when choosing their packing method.  $2 worth of peanuts is nothing compared to having to deal with a $1,000 returned camera.

Luckily all the items inside the box were dry.I have owned a Canon XT before for 1 year, and that was my first DSLR.I'm not a proffessional photographer so the easiest way for me to get good pictures was to shoot RAW and then adjust everything in the computer. That worked pretty well. The average weight of RAW file is 7,5MB and a JPEG was 3-4 MB.I was pretty much happy with it, but i'm the type of guy which would not be satisfied with the lowest model in a range, and there were also some things i did not like in that camera too. Those things are - noisy shutter, it was small for my big hands, the autofocus  was not precise everytime. So I decided that it is time to lay up some money and upgrade my camera. That would have fortunately bring me the following improvements - better ergonomics, faster and more accurate AF, quiter shutter, better ISO performance, some more megapixels, etc. I mostly shoot portraits with my wife and my 4 months old daughter, specially when she sleeps. So a quitter shutter was pretty important to me.So, I got it from the box and made the first shot. I was expecting to see a WOW, bu when I saw the picture on the display my first thought was \"let's look all the settings over again, maybe I messed something up\". Made some changes in the settings and then shot few pictures again, then watched them on the computer. And then i got really confused. Although some shots were looking good, some of them were inexplicably strange - what I mean is that in some cases the ISO gain was very pronounced although the ISO was set to 400 for all the pictures, and the whole images were looking strange (colors, contrast, etc) I can't say what actually is wrong but is just doesn't look good.I tried then shooting raws and convert. That helped me improve the situation, but still it didn't deliver the results I expected. About the same quality I could get with my old XT. Moreover - soon I've noticed a dead pixel near the center of the each picture. It is not noticeable at full picture zoom, but it really annoys me everytime I zoom to 100%.I had a look through all the comments positive and negative before purchasing it, and now I found that some of the old comments would come very closely to my situation. But negative comments are fewer and everytime you purchase something you don't expect yourself to get into the group of those few who write these comments, especially when you buy such a piece of electronics that is called to be a semi-pro.Very disspointingI'm now trying to return it to the vendor, but I live in Europe so it could cost me a lot.
