We purchased a 3000 as a no brainer because the old camera was so awesome.  To be fair the 3000 takes good pictures, however, the battery life is useless.  It lasts for about an hour worth of pictures.  This makes the camera unusable for a day out.  The old model would last for days of heavy use without needing a charge.  I would not recommend this camera for that reason alone.

There are only two good things about this camera:* It can be taken under water when snorkeling and it takes pictures here.* The price is much cheaper than any other camera+underwater box.Everything else is bad.* It takes about 1 or more seconds to take picture after pressing shutter button (with pre-focusing it takes less). When taking a picture of a moving object you always get not what you were aiming at.* Controls on the back side of the camera are pretty inconvenient.* Power button is very close to the shutter button and feels similarly. Several times I switched the camera off instead of taking picture.* Pictures are often bad: either underexposed or overexposed if shot in iAUTO or P modes. When selecting the right Scene quality is decent 60% of the time, but still not as good I would expect (I have 4 other digital cameras from Olympus and Canon)* In low light conditions pictures are often out of focus and very grainy. Sometimes pictures are grainy for no reason.* It does shoot HD movies, but they are HD only because of their dimensions. The quality is pretty crappy, worse than with my old regular movie camcorder.* The battery lasts for about 60 to 80 pictures (comparing to advertised 180); it was constant pain in the ass to keep the camera charged on the yacht. Even without taking pictures the battery lasted for one or two hours only.* Camera turns on quite slow (3.5 sec). So, you cannot keep it always on because the battery would die, and you cannot turn it on quickly if you see some interesting action.* It is difficult to see the LCD in the bright sunlight.Next time if I go to such a trip, I may take this camera again, but only for underwater pictures. For regular pictures I would take a second camera.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic so far", "Author": "Julie Mendez", "ReviewID": "R2QGUECZIJW1J9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll be honest, I haven't used any of the special features on this camera yet.

It's very liberating to not worry if it gets wet or dropped. That alone is worth the price to me. The pictures turn out great and there's a lot of neat photo options like panoramic or fish eye.

Plus, I really liked the fact that it was waterproof and drop proof. I was extremely disappointed. I am very experienced with cameras and have had several of these \"point and shoot\" type digital cameras including Sony and Nikon. Despite reading the manual, experimenting with every setting possible, I cannot take an acceptable picture under any lighting conditions. The colors come out distorted, no matter what. The hues are way off, as if I were taking some sort of avant garde photo. In addition, I found the menu layout and overall operation to be extremely non-intuitive. Every other camera of this type I have owned I could take great pictures right out of the box without even having to read the manual--but that is not the case with this camera. In fact, because I have had such poor performance, I would say that this camera doesn't even perform as a \"point and shoot\" camera should. Every picture I've taken is unusable so I have now fallen back to using the camera in my cell phone. I honestly would not even give this camera one start.

Bought it for a beach vacation when I knew I wouldn't want my \"good\" camera down by the sand and water.  My good camera is a 7.1 MP so I was hopeful that this little camera would meet or exceed the quality of my Canon that I have had for years.  Unfortunately it comes nowhere close.  The autofocus is terrible...probably half of the shots were out of focus when I never have that problem with my Canon.  In addition, the battery life is so bad that I only made it through about half of the day taking maybe 60 shots before the battery died.  Ridiculous to have to charge the battery every afternoon in my opinion.

My previous camera worked great but while at the beach with my toddler it got sand in the zoom lens and stopped working.  I decided to use this opportunity to buy a camera that would take exceptional pictures so I tried out a DSLR and a really nice Canon.  After trying out both those cameras, one large and one mid-size, I decided to try a compact camera that was more durable so it would survive the beach and playground and my toddler.  This camera is awesome!  Compared to the other two the pictures are a great quality, maybe not quite as vibrant but I can't tell much of a difference.  The best part is it takes good pictures in nearly every light and it captures my toddler while in very speedy motion.  The other cameras I tried had a hard time keeping up with him and pictures were often a blur of moving baby which is sooooo frustrating.

I was looking for a waterproof camera because every year we're at the beach, waterpark, pool, and just started jet skiing.  I bought this for my 7 year old because it's a tough camera.  She's dropped it 3x on cement and it survived.  Takes great underwater pictures but it is just okay for land pictures.  I bought a second Olympus Stylus for myself to capture the beach and waterpark pics.  I have 3 cameras...a little casio I carry with me for everyday pics, a Sony with great zoom so I can shoot my childrens' concerts or games, and the Olympus.  My husband said I should just make this my everyday camera, but I wouldn't do that because:  BATTERY LIFE is short (definitely buy extra batteries)  I bought a couple of cheap knock off ones.  It's a bit HEAVY..compared to my Casio.  The Olympus was the slimmest reasonably priced waterproof camera I could purchase.  SHOOTS SOMEWHAT SLOW..I have 3 kids under the age of 10 so I wish the camera was a bit faster.  PICTURE QUALITY ON LAND was okay, sometimes grainy and a bit out of focus.  I like the camera but am not in love with it.  If you are like me and you just want take some beach, pool or amusement park ride shots--it's a good camera.  For the cost--it was priced a little above a $100, which I thought was very reasonable but used my Amazon points and got it for free..besides the jet skiing place was going to charge me $20 for one of those 15 pic throw away waterproof film cameras.  Before I got the camera for free, I thought to myself if I just use the camera few times, I've more than made up the cost.

The Tough 3000 is a bargain, but you get what you pay for. The image quality is poor. Having the 12MP capability is useless and just makes the images take up more space. As with the 720, there is a lot of noise when used at higher ISO settings. It still works after many hours of underwater use. There were a few times were during use in water that the buttons on the back panel were non-functional until the camera dried out. It was still able to take pictures, as the power and shutter release buttons were not affected. This wasn't a huge issue, but it makes me wonder how well it will hold up over time.

First noted problem was the battery life, it rarely stays charged after 45 minutes of use, LDC screen on or not.

You end up with tons of blurry pictures and from a person who is the main picture taker at most occasions this has caused some tears. I ended up taking my old camera along with me originally thinking there was just an odd setting I wasn't getting ( I usually use them on manual mode ) but NOTHING can be done to make this camera focus and take a picture with enough speed to get a clear shot. Zooming is worthless too, more blurry pictures or it bleaches the heck out of everything. It can take decent video. Whoo-hoo ( sarcasm )Total junk.

This compact, and powerful little stylish bubble camera has been the answer to everything that I could possibly ask for.When Digital Camera's first came out onto the market my very first camera I received was a little digital Olympus from my dad as a gift..I bet it was something like 5mega pixels or something - but and I loved it too. I carried the little thing everywhere telling my story in self portraying photographs...Then somewhere along the lines I decided to take a photography course and upgraded to a Minolta DIMAGE A.2. The BEST on the market at that time (this was in 2004). It was 10 mega pixel SLR and I spent $1100 on that camera.... I hated it. I still dont really know how to use it. Not to mention that Minolta has now become extinct - so I couldnt even buy parts if I wanted to. For YEARS I had this Minolta this BiG honkin' piece of machinery.... That I simply hated carrying around...Now its 2010, and it was time for an upgrade. Really I was looking for a new still camera that I could compact with me everywhere I went, but there was a catch. I wanted video capacity and HD preferably... Something Cute, and not to expensive...Then TaDa! This little stylus perked up its little face on Amazon.com. Now the first thing that attracted me to this little Olympus was his price...he was comparably priced at approximately $200, and of course because I once had a Olympus before that I very much loved, we instantly had a connection. Then he continued to tell me about himself...\"I'm waterproof\" he said seductively. \"You can carry me around with you, anywhere, and we will have an amazing time...you'll never have to worry about me because not only am I susceptible to water, up to 3 meters... but I'm also Shockproof\" he said cockily to me. \"I'm a Stylus Tough, and I'm one of a kind.\"How could I not fall in love with such a wonderful little camera?But before I could commit to him; I need to feel him, hold him in my hands and KNOW for sure that he was the one for me. So I looked around looking for my prince charming camera. I met many other camera's in the process... but none of them were stacking up to the stylus that I read about on Amazon.comThen Finally I found him! He came in 4 different colors to choose from, but I knew that I wanted him in Red. The clerk as he was showing him to me, was as charismatic as the camera, and I knew that we were a perfect fit. Today was the day that I getting my new little Olympus Stylus 3000!He was perfect to hold in my hand, and I liked that his lens was not retractable. To me, that was a feature that was less likely to cause me to send him away to the warranty hospital. His buttons on the back are rubberized and soft. Everything about this camera is fun and noninvasive. He has many \"magic\" features, and a wide arrange of capture settings such as `cuisine' and `pets'. My favorite setting is the pinhole, and popart in the magicbox. But you can also stencil and create coloring pages!The only downfall that I have about this little camera is uploading the video. The video feed is only compatible in Quicktime (MP4) and I have to convert all my videos in order to alter them in moviemaking which compromises the quality - quite a bit. And when you are recording video you cannot zoom. you can zoom before you start recording and it will work, but once the red little button has been pushed that's it! no changes missy! and unfortunately the features don't work in video either... so no popart videos :(Besides that, I highly recommend this Powerful little 12mp, Stylus Camera![...] Samantha is a part of what is arguably to be the World's Largest Internet Marketing School available.
