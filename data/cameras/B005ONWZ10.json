I ordered this LCD display within just 7 days remaining before leaving the hotel. Although the site advised me it could take between 5 to 11 days to arrive, it took only 2 working days to be delivered. I am back home and have already instaled it in my camera. The display fitted the camera perfectly and it is working fine.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$8.99", "Features": null, "Name": "LCD Screen Display for Nikon Coolpix L11 Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mzcrU-yJL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005ONWZ10"}}
