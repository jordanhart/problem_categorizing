But I can tell you what I, as a rank amateur, like about it and why I chose it.This is the second Canon digital camera I've owned. Last year, I bought the Canon PowerShot SX120IS 10MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Images Stabilized Zoom and 3-inch LCD (and wrote an Amazon review of it with the same opening sentence as this review as well as some other similar bits). I did a fair amount of research into brands and models before purchasing that camera and ended up loving it. It was very easy to use and met all of my relatively simple needs - right up to the moment I dropped it in the Strait of Juan de Fuca when I was ferrying back from Vancouver Island a few weeks ago. (Don't ask.)Because I'd been so happy with that camera, my first impulse was to pick up the same model as a replacement. But knowing how quickly technology seems to change, I decided to check out the new models before making a purchase. That's when I came across the SD4500IS . Admittedly, I was kind of seduced by its design - all sleek and shiny, just lying there tempting me (and I, for one, love the color). But I knew I wouldn't be happy with it unless, like the SX120IS, it met my criteria which is:1. Must be very simple to use. And I mean simple for ME - the aforementioned rank amateur.2. Must take decent pictures even for casual operators with very little experience (again, that would be me).3. Must have a fast shutter speed because grandkids and dogs can move really, REALLY fast.4. Must fit into my purse. (The new purse, with the zipper that I am counting on to pevent things from falling into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, or any other body of water, for that matter.)5. Most importantly, must have Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer.Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a feature I discovered in my search for cameras last year and which quickly became my new best friend. I have a tremor condition that causes fine shaking in my hands. It doesn't bother me and doesn't always affect close work, but it can make holding something steady - say, for instance, a camera - almost impossible. As you can guess, the result of that shakiness when snapping photos is, most often, lousy photos.The Optical Image Stabilizer is like a miracle for me. With it, I can take close ups that are startlingly clear - not every time, of course, but MOST times. And, in combination with a fast shutter speed, the Image Stabilizer really helps me to get some great shots - even action shots - of my grandkids and my dog. I love this feature and would never consider purchasing another camera without it. (Note: I uploaded a photo to the costumer image section for this camera, showing a picture of a Shooting Star flower - Dodecatheon - that I think demonstrates the detail I've been able to capture with the Optical Image Stabilizer.)I had a great salesman, Jeremy, who didn't mind taking some time with me. (Luckily for me, he spoke English in addition to Camera-Techy.) Cleverly picking up on the way I kept gazing longingly at the SD4500IS, Jeremy was able to persuade me that it would meet my needs just as well as the SX120IS had. Like the SX120IS, it's genuinely easy to to operate (even for me! I know! I was shocked, too!) and has the necessary fast shutter speed as well as the Image Stabilizer. It fits into my new purse. Jeremy assured me that if I was happy with the shots I was getting with the SX120IS, I would be equally or even more satisfied with those I would get with the SD4500IS. And, now that I've had a chance to use it, I can confirm that he was right - I'm getting shots that I consider terrific. Yeah!The following features on the SC4500IS also factored into my decision to buy it:1. The HD video capability. I've only used the video mode a couple of times to date (full disclosure: though Jeremy had shown me this feature, my son did have to help me \"remember\" how to both shoot and view videos), but the quality was truly wonderful. Even with my shaky hands, I was pretty impressed with the end product (and kind of amazed that I had done the filming). I don't have a separate video camera and I'm excited to have the option to shoot some videos on occasion, particularly when visiting the grandkids that live 2,000 miles from me.2. The high speed burst mode. I tried this out by taking some shots of my granddaughter playing frisbee with my dog. I really love the `stop-action shots' look and I think this feature is going to be a lot of fun. I enjoy messing around in Photoshop and I already have some ideas for how I can use pictures shot in this manner creatively.3. The low light performance system. I hadn't given this feature much thought until Jeremy was telling me about it. But because my house doesn't get a lot of natural light, particularly in the winter, I believe this will come to be a feature I really appreciate.Of course, its still very new but, so far, I'm loving the new camera and recommend it. While it cost more than the SX120IS, I'm satisfied with my purchase and don't regret spending the extra money. (I'll admit, it helped that I had a gift card.) However, if you're looking for something with a lower price tag, I still highly recommend the SX120IS as well, which is currently selling for nearly $100 less here on Amazon.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Typical Canon Quality", "Author": "Stowaway", "ReviewID": "R1ZRG840CH03BA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We bought this camera to replace our Canon SD790is (which took unbelievably great photos).However, we were disappointed at the image quality of the pictures taken with this. We took pictures with similar composition to ones we had taken with out old camera, and compared them side-by-side. The pictures with the SD4500is were noticeably softer in focus. Details weren't as crisp and sharp and colors seemed washed out.Our biggest problem, however, was with the battery life. Our old camera could take hundreds of pictures between charges. This one didn't even last through one day of taking pictures. It died halfway through my baby shower. I was very disappointed to miss out on a fun and important event for us.The features were fun to play with, like the miniature effect and the ability to shoot high-speed, but they weren't enough to make up for poor image quality and worse battery life.As a result we returned this camera and went with a Canon SD 1400 instead, which so far has been great.Pros:Fun FeaturesGood SizeLong Optical ZoomCons:Battery LifeImage QualityVideos didn't play in Windows 7 (we tried on 3 different systems and it crashed them every time)With a good zoom and a ton of features, the image quality and battery life weren't what we expected from a Canon.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera with One Problem", "Author": "Slowdown", "ReviewID": "R28XAS10NGRMAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had an SD700 before this, but it was stolen. I loved that camera. So solid, so small, such a high picture quality! I would have kept it a long time. This camera, though, is a great package. Though larger than the SD700, it still fits comfortably in a shirt pocket. It's easy to use. It has a surprising number of options for ways to shoot. It takes high quality HD video. It has an amazing burst capability that produces sharp photos even with the lens at 10X. And, yes, that's a sharp 10X optical zoom, nearly miraculous in a camera of this size. This makes it much more versatile than the SD700. The macro capability is also astounding. I don't follow the reviews that complain of image quality. In my experience, this is as good as a shirt pocket point and shoot gets. I also do not buy the comparisons with quality SLRs. Quality SLRs will produce noticeably superior images that can be enlarged beyond what this camera's images will be capable of. (However, some of the macros I've shot have been surprising.) The only camera I compared that seemed to me to shoot obviously higher quality images was the Panasonic Lumix LX-3. I loved that camera. Great images and a great grip. Alas, it is not a shirt packet camera.I thought that the battery issue would not be a problem for me. I understood that the Canon designers were making tradeoffs and that they had come up with a package for which one would have to pay a price. I love that zoom. I love the size. I thought that I would just buy a second battery and keep it charged. Actually, the logistics of this turned out to be a little harder than I expected. I bought the camera before the batteries were widely available, and I ended up traveling with only the one battery that came with the camera. The way I was using the camera, it was good for just over 100 shots. I was plugging the charger in every opportunity I found. It was not a good situation. Unfortunately, the worst happened. I left one country for another--and left the charger plugged into the wall in my hotel. My own stupid fault, sure, but it's the only time I've ever done that in my life (a long time!). I ended up taking photos for the rest of my trip with my phone. With the SD4500, they would have been great photos.The reasonably priced Chinese manufactured batteries have now become available, and I've ordered two, along with a new charger. I'm prepared for a second life with the SD4500. I recommend this camera, but I also recommend thinking carefully about how you will deal with the battery issue. I missed a lot of shots in one country, and I missed some other countries altogether. Learn from my mistakes.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "WOW! What a Great Camera", "Author": "Mom of Three", "ReviewID": "RI2VQ9FC089LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought our Canon PowerShot SD4500IS this week.  It functions above and beyond what we expected.  Very easy for a grandmother to operate and very engaging for my husband to play with.The Automatic feature is wonderful for most shots, even detecting the type of shot and making settings to match.The special additional features make the camera fun.  A few of them are:1. Set it to take 5 rapid shots and the camera picks the best one.2. Set it to for smiles and it will wait until it detects a smile before taking the photo.3. Set it for wink and it will take the shot after detecting the wink - this lets you get in the photo and signal when the camera takes the photo.4. Taking photos at night, the camera combines 5 photos to create a great nighttime shot.5. The movie feature lets you take up to 2 hours of video, if you get a 32 GB card.All this plus Consumer Reports rates its predecessor as one of the top 2 digital cameras, and this one is even better.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Long Time Canon Powershot User Disappointed", "Author": "daretodream", "ReviewID": "R1IMQM2GLSTC31", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had this camera for a week, took about 300 pictures and lots of HD video and returned it.I would be surprised if people that gave this camera a 4 or star rating had canon powershot camera's in the past.If they did, they would be disappointed with this one. Previous models had much quicker startup times, a much faster lens, and a better autofocus setting. I was also disappointed with the low light pictures, despite using the nightshot mode and trying my best to keep the camera as still as possible. Many times in auto mode, the flash would not fire when it should have and even after putting it in manual mode and turning the flash on, it would not fire. The battery life, as mentioned in other reviews, is a joke, ESPECIALLY when filming HD video - that sucks the battery very quickly. I wasnt concerned when I read this in other reviews, as I figured I was just get an extra battery, but I have to say that it is pretty ridiculous. I was also somewhat disappointed with the picture quality. The pictures did not \"pop\" like my 5 year old SD 550. I was also very frustrated with the layout of menu's and trying to access macro mode, iso settings and the night mode. You have to access them electronically, which took me longer than just turning the \"dial\" which my sd 550 had. Perhaps this is because I still was not used to this new camera, but to me if it still feels cumbersome after a full 6 days of back to back shooting, thats telling me something.The selling point on the camera for me were the impressive list of features. The 10x optical zoom is fantastic and took great pictures even at the full 10x zoom. The HD videos (in 1080p) were also great and I loved the one touch movie button. Other positive points were the high burst picture mode that was great for filming wildlife photography and was one of the most impressive and best features of the camera, besides the 1080p video.Overall though, the great zoom and excellent movie fuction were not enough for me to justify spending $320 on a pocket camera that frustrated me. What's the use of having a great feature set, if the camera isnt quick enough (lens, startup time) or does not have the battery life, to capture that one moment that you wanted to photograph ?", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed Canon fan", "Author": "Dean Baird", "ReviewID": "R1L267BPI8XRXQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera has a large feature set and no shortage of bells and whistles. I tried it for two weeks. But I had to return it. I'm an advanced amateur; I own (and shoot!) a Canon EOS 40D SLR, Canon PowerShot S3-IS, Casio EX-F1, and Fujifilm HS10. (I've been shooting digital since 2000.) I wanted something pocketable, so I thought I'd be safe with Canon's latest in this line. I was mistaken.Here are the problems.1. Images run the gamut from soft to out of focus, especially in low light. Even when the camera thinks it's got a focus lock.2. Tendency to hunt for focus during video (even when shooting a fairly static scene--one handled effortlessly by the much older S3-IS).3. The low-capacity battery.I took a lot of pics, but couldn't get any that were truly sharp. I found the camera frustrating to use. And the battery went from full charge to dead much too fast. I was pulled in by the long feature list and compact size. But the real-world performance was a let down.I'm switching to the Casio FH100. It did very well in DPReviews' Travel Zoom Shoot-out.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "So far so good.  ATTENTION:  Do NOT use this camera is \"AUTO\" mode!!!", "Author": "P. Val \"Peter\"", "ReviewID": "R2LBVUJTGI4R90", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me preface this review by saying I have a Canon SD750 which both my fiancee and I LOVE and have owned for about 4 years now.  However it has been dropped many times and doesn't quite work the same anymore, although in proper lighting it still takes amazing pictures.  Having said all that, there are a few flaws that really nagged me about the camera which the SD4500is fixed.Now for a few thoughts on the Canon SD4500is.1)  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, use this camera in the AUTO mode.  I'm not quite sure how they ever let this camera get released with the AUTO setting the way it is.  It literally takes at least 5 seconds or more for it to decide how and when it wants to take a picture.  And when it does the pictures come out terrible.  When I first opened up the box and took out the camera, I tried taking a picture of my Christmas tree from about 4-6 feet away.  Well the camera came out of the box with the AUTO mode on.  I pressed the button to take the picture... and waited... and waited... the camera tried its hardest to focus, then the picture went all blurry until it was just huge blobs of lights and tree, and then it finally snapped the picture.  The picture was just horrible.  I later realized that for some reason the camera was trying to take the picture in the \"macro\" mode, which doesn't make sense at all and is probably the reason the picture was big blobs of lights.  Anyway to make a long story short, when shooting almost anything, the AUTO mode seems to take way too long and screws up most of the time anyway.  Don't use it, just use the middle mode, the picture of the camera on the switch on the top of the camera.  The regular mode works perfectly fine.2)  I read a few complaints about the start-up time for this camera on the reviews here.  Let me compare some times for you.  I did a quick search online and found an online stopwatch and timed the startup times for my old SD750 and for the new SD4500is.  The startup time for the SD750 was 1.5 seconds.  The startup time for the new SD4500is was 3 seconds.  So its about double the time.  It seems fairly quick when you are starting it up but the fact is its about double the time than my old camera.  Right now I don't see it as such a big deal but maybe when I miss that once in a lifetime shot b/c of the extra 1.5 seconds I'll think differently about it.3)  One of my problems with my old SD750 was the lack of Image Stabilization (it usually took great pictures anyway but it would have helped in several different picture-taking scenarios).  Well the new SD4500is has it and it seems to work great, all the pictures in well-lit areas or with flash come out very clear.  Big plus for the new SD4500is.4)  Now for the money feature, the feature you SHOULD be buying this camera for or else you might as well just get the $100 Canon powershot.  The 10x optical zoom.  Yes, its real, and its fantastic.  The 10x optical zoom takes really nice pictures and the zoom is usually more than enough.  My old SD750 only had a 3x optical zoom I believe.  So basically anything after that it was hit-or-miss on whether it'd take a clear picture or not.  With the SD4500is you don't have to worry about that, with the zoom your pictures will be clear.5)  Size DOES matter.  Our old SD750 was nice and small, lightweight, you could fit it in your pocket and just go.  When I ordered the new SD4500is, I was afraid it'd be a lot bigger.  Well it is bigger, but not as much as you'd think.  Its still small enough to fit in your pocket.  I was pleasantly surprised, to the eye it almost looks to be about the same size as our old camera.  The punch this camera gives you for its size is simply amazing.  Pleasantly surprised in this area.6)  Look and Feel.  The new SD4500is does feel a bit heavier than the older SD750, but its not going to be a problem.  It sort of makes it feel more solid and expensive if anything.  The SD4500is looks great.  We bought the brown color because it was the cheapest ($270 on amazon at the time), and my fiancee was worried it would look stupid.  But when it came we were both pleasantly surprised, it looks better than it does in the picture in the product description.  Its a nice deep brown color, the back is lighter.  The whole camera looks nice though.  The back of the camera has what looks like a 3\" widescreen lcd display.7)  Button layout.  The layout is similar to my old SD750 but with some improvements.  The separate video record button is a welcome addition.  The button for just viewing your pictures is also great (I've seen other cameras where you have to turn a dial just to see your pictures and it gets really annoying).  I also love having the option to either press the dial button or turn/rotate the button.  Pressing the button can get annoying after a while, especially when viewing photos you've just taken.  Turning the dial is much easier and intuitive.8)  Features.  There are a ton of photo-settings on the camera, you will probably use less than 10% of them.  One feature I love is the ability to control the flash.  With my old SD750, I could only choose for it to be on AUTO or OFF.  It was so annoying not to be able to put it to ON.  Well with the new 4500is you can choose AUTO, ON, OFF, or some other low-light option.9)  Low-light Pictures.  I've seen some reviews on here and blast the low-light pictures this camera takes.  I tried the low-light picture-taking setting (with the flash OFF) and the reviews are correct, the photos come out grainy and not quite in focus.  Or maybe just grainy.  Either way they're not that good.  Forget using the low-light option.  Either take the picture like normal with the flash off (which come out a little better), or turn the adjustable ISO to 800 or 1600.  This lets a bit more light in but is quick enough to take a nice picture.  The pictures don't come out perfect but they seem to be about the same or better than my old SD750 would take with the flash off in low-light conditions (with the \"high iso\" setting).  About as good as you can get from a pocket-digital camera in my opinion.  If you put the ISO any higher you will need a tripod or set it on a table or something to get a clear picture.  So in summation this camera CAN take pretty good pictures in low-light conditions, you just can't use the low-light setting because then the pictures come out terrible.Let me add this.  With the flash ON in low-light conditions, it takes great pictures.  Flash is amazing.10)  Macro Mode is great.  Just like with my older Canon, this camera takes great pictures of things really really close up.11)  Battery meter.  Even though I've heard the battery life is pretty bad (I haven't drained it fully yet as I keep stopping for the night and throw it back on the charger), this camera has a BATTERY LIFE METER!!!  Thank god!  My old Canon sd750 did NOT have this feature and it drove me crazy.  With my old camera, all of a sudden it'd say \"low bat\" and then turn off a few pictures later.  There was no warning!  With this camera you can at least see the battery life going down and adjust accordingly.  Great feature I wished my old camera had.12)  Video.  I have only shot about 15 seconds of 1080p video, I hooked it up to my LED tv for playback and the picture is great.  I took the video inside, the area was lit but not well-lit.  Sound is really good and I didn't have those focus issues other people were talking about (although I only took 15 seconds of video so...).  I have a feeling their issues came from either having it in AUTO mode or using the optical zoom in video mode.  I will take more longer videos and get back to you guys on this issue...13)  Pictures.  Overall the pictures seem to come out very good.  I've only used the camera inside so far, I will use it outside and update my review.  The pictures seem to have good color and come out clear.  Many reviewers talk about it not being \"crisp\" enough.  Honestly I am undecided on the whole thing.  They don't really seem to come out \"soft\" to me, but I also haven't taken many pictures with the camera either.  I will take more over the weekend and update my review.  As of now the picture quality seems just as good as my old SD750.  One thing I did notice is that the pictures on the lcd screen, the color is slightly off.  For example, I took a picture of myself against a white background with the flash off.  The white background looked a bit yellow-ish on the lcd screen, but when I viewed it on my tv it looked white.  So I'm not really sure whats going on here, I think the color on the lcd is slightly off which people may have noticed and figured the camera took poor pictures, but as long as they are correct when printed or transferred to your CPU, then who cares?  Like I said I will take a ton more pictures and update my findings.Summary:Bottom line is that you are spending the money on this camera for the 10x optical zoom and ability to shoot full HD video.  If that's not why you are buying this camera then I suggest you get a cheaper one.  Having said that, its well worth the money for the extra zoom and HD video if that's what you are into.  Some of the features (such as AUTO mode and low-light setting) simply do not work.  But you don't need them anyway.  I will take many more pictures and videos over Christmas and update my review.  I just had to write this now because I see all the bad reviews about the picture-quality and I felt I needed to write this to clear some things up.UPDATE 12/26/10If this is your first camera and you didn't know any better you'd be very very happy with this camera. But most of the negative reviews are from previous Canon owners that have been spoiled by great quality pictures, and honestly I'm not sure if this newer and more expensive camera gives you as good a picture as my 4 year old Canon SD750 that has been dropped on rocks and had sand in the lens and the lens-cover has been broken off and it STILL takes great pictures. Although after having that 10x optical zoom of the SD4500 in my hands, its hard to let go... really hard lol... but its all about trade-offs i suppose.One of the most important factors was my Fiancee was just not sold on this camera and that was basically one of the more important reasons in returning it. But other than that, we use the camera 95% of the time for taking regular pictures, no zoom, no video, just pictures. And so I'm strongly considering just paying the extra $100 and getting the Canon S95 as I haven't seen anyone complain about the pictures that camera takes. We end up taking a lot of self-pictures (where I stick my arm out with the camera and take a picture of the both of us) and supposedly the S95 has a wider lens which is better for those type of shots. Not to say the SD4500is doesn't take good pictures, but for the money we're spending we want to have piece of mind that its taking as good or better pictures than our previous camera, we don't want to downgrade in the one area we are mainly going to use the camera for. Also the battery life factors into it as well, by the time you spend the money on extra batteries and the hassle that comes with making sure you bring an extra battery everywhere that just piles on you know?So I guess that would be my final answer. If you are in love with the 10x optical zoom and 1080p video, get this camera because despite other reviewers it DOES take good pictures as long as you don't have it on the stupid AUTO setting. The SD4500is doesn't take the best low-light pictures but I geuss you could call them passable. Also the slow-mo video is pretty cool and funny. But if you're like me and you've been spoiled by a previous camera that took great pictures, and you're not that concerned about all the bells and whistles of this camera, either spend the extra $100 and get the Canon S95, or if you're not as concerned about low-light picture quality then save yourself some money and get the $100 canon P&S;'s.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not as good as I had hoped", "Author": "Anna-Marie O'Brien", "ReviewID": "RZLVDTUXKZ520", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have an old SD600 that has worked beautifully for the past three years.

The SD4500IS falls way short of what I have come to expect of Canon cameras. The autofocus takes way too long to focus on a subject and even then the shots are not always in focus. When taking a picture in low light the LCD display gets dark to where it is hard to see the image that you are trying to capture. The video is very grainy and the camera is even worse at focusing during the capture. I took about 4.5 minutes of video and for the first 2 minutes it was out of focus. I had to move the shot to a dark area and then back to the subject before it actually got in focus. I have a Samsung camera that only does 720p that takes very clear video and the Canon SD4500IS is supposedly 1080p HD. On the plus side the image stabilization was great.

You can literally go from in your pocket to taking an exposure in like two seconds -- no lens cap, it comes up in whatever mode you left it in from auto to a specific program mode. Controls seem quick and intuitive -- The reason I got this one was that shots happen in seconds and you have a choice of getting the perfect one or one. In Auto in normal light seems to give great shots, even blown up to pixel size. And all  of those tricky special modes are available so easily -- I can't imagine anything that can't be done in seconds from when your wife says, \"Oh look at that flock of birds - freeze them as they fly away.\" (Of course, the way that would go down is \"I'll bet you missed that one ... Oh!

If she can hit the On button, do a quick zoom if needed, and squeeze off a shot, we're going to get some great photos.The Handheld Night mode does give images better than other modes, but I haven't gotten the hang of the focus I guess because they come out very \"soft\" (more later when I am more than 2 hours experienced with the camera.)The size is terrific -- I've had an S50 and an SX3 and this is much smaller -- and has the zoom range of the SX3 and possibly better low light than the S50. The lack of a bit wider wide angle is somewhat noticeable, but given everything else this does, who cares!By the way, Amazon was so quick getting this one listed and to customers that they appear to have caught the web folks at Canon flat footed.

I certainly am no expert in photography but I would imagine anyone who is would not be in the market for this camera anyway. Operate under no illusions when purchasing this model - it is ultimately a simple point and shoot. Now just a quick run down of some major pros and cons.Pros: What really sold me on this camera is the 10X optical zoom. That is a very hard find among the Elph line of cameras. The LCD screen is beautiful and the battery life runs pretty strong. But really, I must go back to the 10X optical. That feature and that alone I feel is what really sets this Elph apart from comparable models.Cons: I would have to start a lack of a wide angle lens. This detract from some of the picture quality in certain settings. As for features I would say the decision to place a one-click hit 'record video' button right next to the LCD screen instead of having it as a feature along the top of the camera as it used to be was something short of awful. I cant begin to tell you how many times I have accidentally recorded 30 second clips of me looking at nothing in particular.

So, christmas time is here, and canon has a new camera!  10x optical zoom, nice large lcd screen to view pictures 1080p video.  And multiple other features that led me to this camera.  My wife and I really like the auto feature of the old canon, and this is a new version so it should be much better, right?  Wrong.  Dead wrong.  The camera spends up to 8 seconds picking out the scene it wants to use before it will let you take the picture.  We have 2 little kids and trying to get them to stay still for that long is like trying to ride a bull for 8 seconds - it just isn't going to happen.  I was sure it was just a fluke... something is weird.  Nope, after testing and testing and trying, and reading reviews, it turns out the auto feature is worthless on this camera.  Almost every single picture taken with auto on was blurry and not once did it use the flash in auto.  So, I know, use the manual settings and turn on flash.  Yeah, I can do that, and the pictures were ok, but not knowing how to set all the features for specific light conditions and speed and others that I know nothing about is kind of cumbersome, and it just won't work with little kids.

It actually takes better pictures than some film SLRs I've used in the past. I couldn't care less about it's video capabilities, so I won't comment on them. The quality of the photo is my prime concern, with size being second. This is an astounding camera with picture quality unmatched by any thing else it's size out there. I even love the brown color, it kind of has a 1950's warm and fuzzy feeling to it (for me, that is).The image stabilization is top notch and enables me to take pictures at rather slow speeds hand held.

I have a full sized sensor SLR for that.Macro mode is phenomenal, the pictures it produces look very much like they were taken with a high quality macro lens on an SLR.My only con is the lack of an optical viewfinder. This might be an impossibility because of the 10x zoom. Obviously there's no way to stick on an add on viewfinder with a zoom camera.

Atkins", "ReviewID": "R1CE1J1PDHTCEL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I wanted to have a small camera with maximum optical zoom and a large lens for low light pictures and also the ability to shoot HD video with zoom controls. This camera has done amazingly well producing very clear images and video in low light situations without the usual digital 'noise' that I have seen in many other cameras.The SD4500IS has an excellent hand held low light mode that allows you to take pictures in very low light of stable scenes without the usual fuzziness that comes from camera shake. In Hand held. low light mode, the camera takes 4-6 images of the scene and then processes them into a single image. The result is a high contrast, reasonably sharp image that would otherwise require a tripod or other hard surface to steady the camera in order to shoot with a long exposure. I have taken some truly stunning night time pictures of Christmas lights, coastal scenes, boats on the water in marinas that would have been impossible to get using a conventional long shutter exposure. You do need to make an effort to hold the camera steady to get the best results but it doesn't need to be rock steady - a single hand hold will work. I have found that it is now almost ridiculously easy to take very good, bordering on excellent night scene pictures casually. I still make use of long shutter times when I can setup for the shot and the results are better than the hand held low light mode however, I have also been able to capture many night scenes using the hand held low light mode that I would never have been able to get with a conventional long exposure shot and a missed shot is the worst shot of all.I took this camera an a month long European holiday where I took pictures everywhere - over 6000 - outdoor, indoor, on boats, from trains and buses at speed and the results were outstanding. One of the things that confronts many tourists these days is that many venues either prohibit the use of flash photography or prohibit taking pictures all together. Even where permitted - taking pictures of huge places like the Doge's Palace in Venice or the interior of the Duomo in Florence - a flash is pretty much useless anyway - too much distance for it to do any good. So taking the pictures with the available and usually quite subdued light is an absolute requirement. In addition, this camera has a REALLY nice feature - the Mute option! In those instances where you need to be discrete about taking pictures you can turn off the tattle tale 'click' noise that most other cameras generate and you can take pictures in total silence. The results are amazing.I also carried a Sony Cybershot DSC-W370 on the same trip and found that its smaller lens made it much more difficult to get decent low light pictures and the lack of a mute feature made it impossible to use anywhere that photography was restricted.The video recording feature along with the sound is really very good although wind noise is frequently a problem. Even the slightest breeze produces very annoying wind noise on the audio. I usually carry a separate camcorder but found it completely unnecessary. This camera can shoot video as good as or better than most camcorders! Video resolution can be selected from 1080P on down to 720P, 640 and even 320 making it very versatile. You have variable rate zoom while shooting video and the camera slows the zoom rate down (as compared to not shooting video) while shooting video so that zooming during the video shots looks much more professional. The image stabilization is excellent while shooting video. I can easily obtain a steady shot while shooting at 10x zoom. I typically shoot video in 720P to maximize recording time and still have decent resolution. For most casual video, I find 1080P to be overkill in terms of storage requirements. For my month long time in Europe I took 6000+ images and over 1.5 hrs of video and it all fit on two 16GB SDHC cards. For an example of 720P HD video shot with one hand, holding the camera over my head at the Hollywood bowl visit [...]. That video along with several others that I posted to Youtube demonstrate up to 10x zoom in low light conditions and what you can expect for image stabilization, focus and audio performance.One of the nice features of this camera is the ability to select the JPG compression. I usually use Normal which produces excellent images that can easily be enlarged to 11x14 yet each one typically only requires 800KB to 1.2MB of storage. My Sony DSC-W370 (and all Sony cameras that I have reviewed) doesn't have any JPG compression choices and each image uses 4-5MB at 10Mp resolution and up to 7MB at the full 14Mp resolution. This is a HUGE amount of wasted space for what are mainly casual snapshots. This is one of the reasons I would not recommend any Sony digital cameras - you will burn your storage space up at an alarming rate - not just the on board SD card but, your disk storage at home as well. Even if storage is not your concern - it takes 3-4 times longer to copy the larger Sony images from the camera to the computer and anywhere else you may want to copy them for backup. Yes, I am sure that there are purists out there that will be shocked to have any compression but the reality is that unless you have an expert eye, a magnifying glass and a very large print you will never see the difference between a moderately compressed JPG (80%) image and a RAW, uncompressed image.Overall the SD4500IS is a full featured camera - offering full control and override of virtually all automatic functions. It has image stabilization (essential for 10x zoom use), blink detection, various focus modes and so on. Battery life is an issue - especially with all of the standard features turned on. I had to turn off Servo AF, AF-Point Zoom, Continuous AF and AF-assist beam along with blink detection in order to have a decent battery life which isn't that great to begin with. The worst offending battery consumer is Continuous AF as it continuously processes the image that the camera sees even when you are just carrying it and it just burns through the battery in no time flat.I carry a spare battery and one of the things that I really appreciate is the fact that the wall charger is small enough to fit into the front pocket of the small (perfectly sized) Case Logic case that I use to carry the camera on my belt. This lets me keep the spare battery in the charge cradle for easy access and avoids having to keep the charge separated from the camera running the risk of forgetting it. Once again, Sony blows it as the wall charger for the DSC-W370 is much larger - almost bigger than the camera itself making it impossible to keep in the same small carrying case and I am always looking for it when I need to recharge.The SD4500IS camera has a 3 way slider switch on top that can switch between Full Auto, Program and Video modes. This is handy for being able to switch between full Auto and a more 'manual' Program mode on the fly. I find the video setting for the switch to be redundant with the Video record button that is provided on the top right corner of the back of the camera. The video record button allows you to shoot video on the fly with just a touch. This button can be annoying because it can easily be unintentionally pressed when grabbing the camera and you then have to figure out that it is shooting video when you just tried to take a picture and the ensuring delay while the camera stops shooting video and when you can shoot a picture can lose the opportunity for the picture you were trying to take in the first place.Ergonomically the camera body is not very good - the case is flat and provides no grip on what is a pretty slick surface. I lost count of how many times I 'saved' it before I lost hold of it however, it has already been dropped a couple of times as a result - once on hard concrete. If Canon had put just a slight curve into the front of the body like the Sony DSC-W370 (which is the identical size body), the camera would be much easier to hold onto. As I mentioned earlier, the video recording button is located on the top right corner of the rear of the case and frequently gets pressed unintentionally while trying to hold onto the camera. I appreciate the idea behind this button however, its location combined with the poor shape of the case make it a bit of an irritation. I am impressed with the fact that the camera has taken 2 drops - one directly on hard concrete without any damage other than a small scrape in the front lower right corner.Startup time is pretty decent - about 2 seconds before it is ready to shoot as long as the flash is disabled. 3-5 seconds if the flash is enabled which can be frustrating long. Time between shots will vary greatly depending on what features you have enabled. In full Auto mode it is a ridiculously long 3-5 seconds. In Program mode with most of the AF features and blink detection along with the flash disabled it will shoot every 1-2 seconds. Much slower than any decent digital SLR and one of the more frustrating aspects of all small digital cameras. My Sony DSC-W370 performs about the same. More than once I have wanted to press the shutter button through the case trying to force it to take a picture while it was 'thinking' for an absurd number of seconds. It is the shutter delay that is the most offensive problem with ALL small digital cameras.My only other complaint about this camera is that unlike previous models I have encountered a higher percentage of unfocused images where the camera has missed the focus on more shots than I have experienced with earlier models. While it is a low percentage - I found that I now have to pay close attention to the focus of the shot before I press the shutter and afterwards when I review the shot because I may end up with an unfocused image. Yes, I know that I have AF-assist beam turned off along with other features but actually turning these off helped reduce the number of unfocused images! Clearly there is something not quite right going on with the new larger lens and image stabilization - they may be working against each other and the focus sensor/algorithm is not doing the job as reliably as I had experienced in the past with earlier Canon cameras.Overall, I've learned to be more vigilant on checking the focus and I am very pleased with the vast majority of the images and video that I have been able to take with this camera. It far exceeds the capabilities of earlier Canon Elph series cameras (and I have had 3 so far). It doesn't have some of the bells and whistles that the Sony DSC-W370 has in terms of smile detection and other gee whiz features that most people would need a degree to figure out. While at 10Mp it doesn't have the highest number of Megapixels - it is the image quality that really counts - and the ability to get the image you want that matters. You could have a 14Mp DSC-W370 and end up with a fuzzy shot in a low light situation or a sharp image from the 10Mp SD4500IS. I'll take the 10Mp image over a fuzzy 14Mp one any day. Besides, with most pictures being posted on Facebook, Flickr and other online forums the need for high Mp cameras is greatly exaggerated. Few people actually print their images and most of those are 4x5 or 5x7 sizes that 10Mp images are more than suitable for. Unless you are a professional or pro-amateur like myself, barely compressed 14Mp images are basically a waste. Lens and low light performance are much more valuable features than Mp. Now, if they could just get these cameras to take the picture the moment you press the shutter I would be thrilled!", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor battery life is a show stopper", "Author": "The MaCs", "ReviewID": "R2Y7PDT32236EJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE:Never got around to updating this after more extended use.  The poor battery life makes this camera almost unusable for me.  Also, have had numerous problems wi the shutter cover not closing and the lens not retracting.  Video quality is good, image quality is only fair.  I would look elsewhere for a good camera were I you.Got my SD4500 yesterday to replace a previously ordered SD4000, which I am returning today.  I loved the size and general usability of the SD4000 (Canon PowerShot SD4000IS 10 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Zoom and f/2.0 Lens (Red)), but it had two glaring problems I was hoping the SD4500 would correct: lots of soft-focus or out-of focus photos unless you take extreme care to press the shutter half-way and constant loss of focus when using movie mode.I have not had a ton of experience on the SD4500 yet, but so far it seems to have made improvements in both areas, but not resolved the problems completely.The video quality is definitely a step up (1080p Full HD vs 720p) and rivals the great quality video from a Sony TX7 I used for a while. The SD4500 retains focus well (as long as the optical zoom is not used), has pretty decent stability assist, and good sound.  It does seem to have a bit of trouble refocusing when using the optical zoom, but this is tolerable.  There is little audio noise added when zooming. The mini-HD connection is great for viewing photos and movies on HDTVs, and I have no problems transferring and viewing movies on my PC with the latest versions of Windows media Player, Quick Time, and Windows Live Photo.The jury is still out on photo quality, as I have only taken photos in some fairly challenging lighting conditions.  The SD4500 so far does a better job than the SD4000 in auto-focusing, but tends to take a bit longer to do so, so I have ended up missing some shots (again, this may be related to the lighting conditions).  I will update my review when I have a chance to take photos in more varied lighting conditions.Canon has also improved on the already great usability of the SD4000 by adding a dedicated start/stop movie button, so it is impossible to start recording a movie when you really wanted a photo (it is still possible to take a photo when you meant to take a movie, as the shutter control is still active and takes a photo even when the slider switch is in movie mode).  Note that you can not take still photos while you are taking a movie - doing so will simply stop recording the movie. The slider switch to move between movie, still photo program mode, and still photo auto mode takes a bit of getting used to, but with the separate start movie button there really is no need to move the slider unless you want to move between auto and program still photo mode.Also, the SD4500 is a bit bigger than the SD4000 (I measure the SD4500 at 3.9\" w x 2.3\" h x .75\" d) but it fits pretty comfortably in a shirt or pants pocket.To sum up:Pros: easy to use, great package, good HD videoCons: a bit slow in auto focusingJury still out on: Overall photo quality - will come back an update later", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Disapointed Canon Fan", "Author": "Joshua M.

It takes about 3 full seconds to get this camera out of your pocket, push the on button, and wait for the lens to do a little dance. This was ok in 1997, but this is about 2 seconds too long in 2010. With the Sony, I can slide down the lens cover and snap a shot almost instantly. I've been frustrated too many times in the couple of days becuase of missing a monment forever while waiting for this camera to warm up.Then there is the chunkiness of this camera. I am happy to carry a slightly bigger camera in my pocket if it is going to give me noticeably better pictures, but the SD4500 is bigger for no benefit.Additionally, I've also gotten used to (addicted to?) the 28mm lens on the Sony. With the SD4500, I feel like I am only getting a narrow slice of what it right in front of the camera. The wider angle on the Sony does add distortion, but again, for me, this has many times been the difference between getting the shot or missing it.Finally there is battery life. I've had to recharge the battery twice in the past week. On my Sony I typically got at least a week between charges. I'd take shorter battery life in exchange for better pictures and or smaller size, but again this camera delivers on neither of these.I do still love the fact that Canons use a normal USB port as opposed to the silly Sony dock, but I can live with the dock in exchange for getting the pictures I want.The end of the story is that I picked up a new Sony TX Series DSC-TX9/H 12.2MP Digital Still Camera with \"Exmor R\" CMOS Sensor today and am putting the SD4500 on ebay tonight.-josh", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "lens issues", "Author": "Fox", "ReviewID": "R3605XJX8GR1LR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Camera is excellent but I just returned it for the second time as the lens doesn't move in and out anymore.

I'd probably still be researching, but Best Buy had a deal that nobody has been able to beat since, so I bought the camera.

I am not an expert or camera nut...just an every day guy who likes to take a camera with me when I go for a walk or on a trip.  This review was written by someone with absolutely no expertise in cameras, so take it for what it's worth.  We went walking along the beach yesterday with friends and taking photos.  I had accepted the fact the photo quality for this camera was so-so, but really got angry when my friend and I compared photos.  His colors were radiant and full, and the images had sharp, clean edges.  Mine had good colors, but the image did not have the sharpness...more blurred or soft, lacking in detail compared to my friends point and shoot camera (Panasonic LUMIX).  He bought his camera at COSTCO and paid less than I paid for mine, yet the difference in photo quality was stunning.  I was wondering if any SD4500IS \"experts\" are experiencing the same problem with photo quality.  I sure would like to know if you were able to correct the problem.

I was very disappointed when I saw the photos and video on the PC after downloading.  I couldn't understand why the quality was so much worse than with my older model- Powershot SD870 IS.  I ensured I was selecting the highest quality level options.  Upon research, I found that this camera does not offer the \"super fine\" compression option as in the SD870. (Can't believe I actually now know what the compression options means, bit for bit!)  This makes the file size much smaller and also the quality much worse.  Now, will it print out a nice 4X6?  Probably.  I didn't even try.  I am used to seeing the great quality 4-5 mb photos - these 2-3 mb photos just do not compare.  I returned and bought a Nikon Coolpix S80 (the SD870 broke else I'd just have stayed with this camera).

They should provide a user guide explaining different modes and settings and how to go about changing them using the buttons and wheels provided my the cam.Above all, the battery life is the most disappointing factor in this camera. The battery doesn't last more than a 100 shots without flash! I ran out of battery during my last two trips and missed out on some really good photos.

SD4500 was a bad choice.SD4500 has some very impressive features: 10x zoom (versus my 3x zoom), full hd video, lots of picture modes including low light, panoramic stitching, fish-eye, etc. Unfortunately, it does not do the basic job well which is what I need.- Battery life is horrible. This is the camera that will die on you half-way through the zoo trip or in the middle of a birthday. It is supposed to take 150 shots per charge, but averages much less. I ran out of batteries in a single afternoon.- Video is blurry. It starts out perfect with a crisp picture, but somehow as soon as you move it slightly the auto-zoom decides it needs to re-focus and everything goes blurry to the point where you cannot make out people in the shot anymore, just color blobs.- It is heavier and larger than the SD1000. The difference is supposed to be very little according to the specs, but the camera feels much bulkier.- The startup dance is annoying. This camera is meant to be point-and-click, so staring at the \"Canon\" image while the lens comes out for 2 (3?) seconds means you will most likely miss your shot.- The zoom is great, but unless you are using a tripod you will need to get used to the \"warning: shaky camera\" message. If I was going to carry a tripod, I would not have opted for a small camera.- Too clever for its own good. On \"Auto\" mode, it guesses what type of picture you are trying to take, but because it has lots of picture modes, it sometimes has a hard time making up its mind going from people to scenery to macro which changes the focus. On the SD1000, if you pan the camera left-right you see the picture on the LCD moving left-right. On the SD4500, you get a blurry picture moving left-right as the camera goes through different modes, keeps adjusting the focus. Looking at the LCD when moving the camera game my partner motion sickness!Recommendation: Get Cannon PowerShot SD1000 or another camera. Too many features squeezed prematurely into this camera.

Not fabulous, but pretty well considering the 3.4 aperture lens. In the right lighting this camera takes great pictures and if your subject is not moving much and you have a few seconds set-up time, you can take great pictures with the zoom. Let's face it, the zoom and the price is why you bought this camera, right? It's why I did.But now let's skip the accolades I covered in the PROS and get right to the dirty. The zoom is slow, plain and simple. If you can capture anything but a non-moving target when zoomed in, it will be because that target is cooperating and there are no time limitations. If you plan on trying to snap some pics of your daughter playing soccer or your dog having a ball in the park, forget it. You're going to be much better served with a super zoom or a dSLR. Canon tries here but fails in my opinion. The lens WILL however allow you to frame longer distance stills that you couldn't do without cropping.Movie performance is very good combined with the zoom. Just last night I filmed portions of my son's music concert in a dark auditorium. The movies came out great although the sound recording leaves something to be desired. You may want to buy a stand alone sound recorder and combine them using software on your computer for optimum quality. BUT, and here's the huge BUT (not butt), the battery life makes this a giant pain and is why I now plan on selling the camera. I got maybe 12-13 minutes of recording out of one fully charged battery. Then I had to remove my monopod from the tripod thread to replace the battery, rethread, power up and then get another maybe 12-14 minutes of video. I had to switch to my S95 to record the rest (30 mins) of the concert, which it did on a partially used battery and still had life left. I couldn't zoom in as much though. The battery life and the hassle of swapping in time sensitive situations is the HUGE deal breaker in my opinion.Why make a camera that is supposed to be able to take great pics in most situations, near and far, and do 1080p video (only 24fps by the way) only to severely hobble it with a very weak battery? Why!Just to quickly cover the rest of my CONS, which would not be deal breakers in and amongst themselves. The camera is pretty big for a compact, which it really has to be for the wide screen LCD and the big lens. I actually like the feel of it, especially ergonomically, but be aware that if you are looking for a cam to slip into your front pants pocket or tuck away in a purse, this may not be the right one for you. Especially when you figure in the charger and/or the 3-4 extra batteries you have to carry...  The scroll wheel is a little hard to get a grip on, especially with dry hands, which in the NE means about 8 months out of the year. This camera hunts a bit focusing, even in bright light when zoomed in. And I already mentioned the battery door right next to the tripod mount. Since you have to swap batteries often, you know what that means.SUMMARY:If you can accept the limitations of this camera, then it is a good deal. Especially after the price drops. But if you want a really compact cam, this isn't it. And if you do anything more than snap a few shots here and there and take a 2-3 minute video now and again, this camera will drive you bonkers trying to keep it fed with power. What could have really been a do all/be all camera fails hugely with the lack of a quality battery. Since they obviously weren't trying to make the most compact camera in their line, it is inexcusable. Sorry Canon, but I'm no fan of this one.Lastly, if you can forego the zoom and can pony up the extra cash, buy the S95 (skip the S100, it has issues). The quality and value in that little camera will astound you. As close to a dSLR picture in a mini-cam as you can get at the moment. Just terrific, especially in low light with its 2.0 aperture lens.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Very Slow!", "Author": "Liz", "ReviewID": "R16IUCUWJ9ETT2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for the zoom capability.

After having the camera for only one day I'm glad that I retuned it. I do agree very much with other reviewers, one simple reason: very poor indoor picture and video quality and \"OK\" outdoors. The fact is that my 5 years old P&S; camera Sony DSC-W7 takes sharper with more accurate colors images both indoors and outdoors.  One of the most important reasons for it is that most of the today's P&S; cameras have much smaller  sensors like Canon's 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor vs. my old Sony which is 1/1.8-inch CCD. It seems like electronics made big improvements over the years but not in P&S; cameras department.  Video is also one of the worst I've seen especially indoors. If someone wants beautiful videos from vacation or special occasion then just buy video camera which is made for making videos.I must admit that I like the design and long zoom very much and having 1080p video capability but then on the other hand  I was looking for improvement in picture quality over my old Sony and that was NOT the case.

I was so impressed when I was taken pictures of my nieces at the water park with the moving wave pool in the background and getting them to hold still is always fun.

It happens every so often, but its very rare that a picture will turn out blurry. Even in low light.The one exception... the battery. Other reviewers have mentioned it as well, but I don't think it is as bad as some have said. I have had batteries that have lasted longer and I've had others that died faster. Its a middle ground battery. We decided to make a weekend out of a wedding, so we left on Friday and the wedding wasn't until Saturday night. Had it fully charged before we left and brought the charger with us because I had read the reviews. We took in the town taking picture here and there. The next day of coarse I was taking pictures at the wedding. Most of witch I was zoomed in and still got beautiful shots. Still haven't got the hang of the Macro shots. Anyway, the battery lasted until the end of the evening when we were heading home. One plus is it doesn't seem to drain the battery when not in use. I've left it for a week and it still had a full charge. So yes, not the best battery, also not the worst. Bring the charger, its not big.

Perfect combination of features to create the best combination of Digital Still Camera and HD Video camera.2. Compact size - fits into trouser/shorts pocket.3.

Low resolution LCD display (compared to the gorgeous display on Nikon S8100)3.

From previous reviews it was clear that the picture and video quality are good, but battery life is really bad. And after using it for a while, it turned out to be true.It is a fairly simple device to use and for casual everyday picture/video taking it is a good device. Image stabilization is good and it has pretty good low light capabilities. Picture quality is also decent for a point-and-shoot camera.What impressed me the most about this camera, both on the fact sheet and in real use, are the video capabilities. It does full HD, has dedicated video recording button and one can use the whole 10x optical zoom while recording. The video quality is good. It definitely rules out the need to take a dedicated video camera for every trip. Image stabilizer does reasonably good in handheld mode and even in full zoom level, but then again don't expect too much while doing handheld video shots: it is a rather small camera and for completely shake/wobble free shots, one must use some kind of extra equipment (like tripod or handheld steadicam). In addition, it has a nice feature of doing slow-motion shots in low resolution. It is definitely cool feature to experiment with and provides true slow-motion clips for experimental video editing. But that's about it, for practical purposes the video is far too low resolution.And then there is the battery life... I guess I can wrap it up shortly: it is bad and having 1-2 or more extra batteries is a must. I purchased it with some cheap non-Canon replacement battery and it payed off immediately. Wish I had bought even 2-3 of those. Though, I didn't see any reason to buy a Canon brand battery, because it was about 1/4-th of the camera price, way too high in my mind.There are definitely better cameras out there, but it is a rather solid everyday point-and-shoot camera, with plenty of zoom and image quality.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST ANY CAMERA THAT USES A 9L (AA size) lithium BATTERY. It is just not adequate. Although they seem to be slightly cheaper and smaller than the older rectangular and square lithium cells of the SD500 era, these batteries are not worth the trade-offs. They are not cheap enough that you can just go out and buy a dozen. I would prefer to have a camera that I can use most of the day without going back to the hotel to charge batteries.

We also own a Canon G6 (old, but takes awesome pictures), but a more pocket able camera would allow us to take shots that otherwise wouldn't get taken -- the G6 is large. I will offer some comparison to the G6, to allow some frame of reference:- the battery life of the SD4500IS is pretty good, considering that the battery pack is a single-cell affair- the image processing is a little slower than my G6, despite having a DIGIC chip that is 2 generations newer. This is probably a combination of battery power use and less sophisticated circuitry for a smaller size- the optical image stabilization works well- the optical zoom is very good, although the lens motor is on the slow side for changing focal length- the camera is well-built, and has good ergonomics in the hand- the screen is nice and large, and the resolution is noticeably better than my G6 -- 8 years of LCD progress here- an impressive list of manual settings for a point & shootViewing on the PC, I can tell the difference between pictures taken with this and with the G6. The G6 has better color balance, more accurate auto-focus, a higher quality lens, and a more powerful flash. The low light performance isn't as good as the G6, but is still pretty good for a point & shoot. I bought this camera as an OEM refurbished unit, so I think I got a great deal for what I paid (less than half of retail). It's not a substitute for a prosumer camera like the G6 or a digital SLR, but it does take very good pictures, it's well-made, it's very small, and the price is excellent.
