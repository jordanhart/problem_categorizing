This camera has everything I was looking for and just a bit more.Pros:I am impressed with the amount of control the H55 gives me.Panoramic imaging built in (its nice to see the results right away rather than just eyeballing it) .Image quality - wow @ 14MP, the images are gorgeous.Color accuracy is great with good lighting.The camera handles quite nicely and is very easy to navigate.The wide angle lens is fantastic at this price. As a pro I would have spent a couple hundred on the lens alone.Excellent range on zoom. I was quite happily surprised.Battery life seems much more adequate than the W330 I previously purchased and returned.Cons:The flash is far from balanced and seems too hot to be used for fill. I'm new on this camera and I'm used to pro-level equipment, so I'm sure I'm expecting too much here. That, or I just don't yet have the hang of it.Color accuracy breaks down at lower light levels. Since I didn't have a real meter with me, I couldn't tell at which precise number breakdown begins to occur. I would guess around 4 lux is about as good as it gets. Beyond around that, it gets pretty noisy. I'll experiment with some night shooting when I have it on a tripod. But I won't get my hopes up.Doesn't seem to allow you to manually close the lens.

Dubey", "ReviewID": "R293KTGVYNEC0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a replacement to my previous Sony 5.1 MP camera for which i paid the same amount that I paid for this camera.  It's amazing to see a sea change in the quality of the pictures especially under relatively lower light conditions and outdoors. The zoom is outstanding. I can agree with the previous reviewer that the picture blurs, but I have a different take.  If the object moves or if the hand shakes a little.  In my view this is OK becasue multi-burst function has been disabled by default.  But, I have taken moving pictures and it comes out fine most of the time.A word of caustion that do not purchase this camera primarily becasue it has HD recording.  The picture quality of HD recording indoor under medium to low light is noisy.  And even in outdoor, the movie function can't replace what a full blown HD camcorder can do.I recommed this camera to anyone who is looking for shooting great quality indoor/outdoor pictures.  The smaller pocket size of the camera is really a big plus compared to it's predecessor, H-20 model.I haven't utilized all it's features.  I will right more when get to know more about this camera.  One last thing that the black plastic housing looks cheap.  I wish Sony had added some metal and hardness to the body of the camera.  Overall, I give it 5 stars becasue the camera excels in its bottom line functionality which is to take excellent shots.Well, I have some bad news.  After a week of use, I noticed that the camera is washing away the colors if the person is wearing lighter colored clothings like light blue, light green, light yellow, or cream colors. It happens when taking pictures indoor. The lighers-colors in iMode settings don't come exactly the same.  They appear whashed away.  I am having a second thoughts about this camera.  Not to mention that the outdoor pictures are perfect and even the indoor pictures are great if the person is in dark colored clothes.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice camera!", "Author": "J.

I bought this to use as a point-&-shoot, and did not expect to get more than I paid for, but was pleasantly surprised.1 - extremely easy to set up and use.  Charge the battery, install a media card, and turn it on.2 - Battery / memory card door is pretty cheesy.3 - takes good pictures.  pics have good color and brightness, need little to no post-processing.4 - low light pictures are -really- good (for low-light pictures), waay better than I expected.  Bravo twilight mode.5 - panorama mode works well and is priceless if you do much shooting in tight quarters, or of large groups - however, no zoom.  Wide-angle only, which maximizes cylindrical distortion.  I still love it.6 -  I do mostly stills and had little interest in movie mode.  Very much appreciated saving $100+ from the HX5V.7 - Works as advertised.

My last Camera, before this one, was a 12 Megapixel.  And I thought it, at first to be ALL THAT.  This was only because my previous camera had been a four Megapixel.  I was so impressed with the increase in the resolution that is all I could see was the ability to crop photos to a better end then I had been able to.  After the newness had worn off I began to realize the Cameron was just a lemon.  So with this camera, that mistake will not happen again.  The (14 Megapixel) of this Sony camera is not that different from my (12 Megapixel) camera that I am replacing.  So I will look past the resolution difference with ease.However the (10 x) zoom lens is NEW.  Not only to me, but to all (point and shoot) cameras I have ever seen.  Now, the 10 x zoom lens that I am talking about is NOT digital zoom.  But rather, purely optical.  There is a digital zoom offered in the menus of this camera.  But I simply turned this feature off.  If I want to do any digital zoom, I'll do it in Photoshop on my own time.Other perks include; a battery and charger.  The battery is lithium.  And knowing that a lithium battery must be conditioned before its true capacity can ever be obtained.  And even before the battery had been `conditioned' it was still able to take approximately 400 shots.  And of course four or five HRS of me playing around in the menus with the features.  And I know from past experience this can be one of the biggest power drains on a camera battery.  And this is only the first cycle.  I don't foresee a need in my future to buy a spear battery.While I am on the subject of batteries, I need to mention.  The battery charger is a cute little thing.  The part of the plug that actually goes into the wall will fold into the plastic housing.  So it is not a burdensome piece of machinery to store.  And the whole thing is extremely small.  It is only 3\"x2\"x1\".  To me that sounds ridiculously small, and if it were not right here in front of me I might not even believe.  But it is true.  It will fit in my small camera case, instead of the drawer.  I already have enough mess around my room.Also about batteries, there is a handy little gauge, on the LCD screen, that reports the amount of battery left by a four bar indicator (like a cell phone).I spoke earlier about the massive zoom lens.  But I didn't even tell how this camera can also take a macro picture up to about 8\" away at full wide angle (zoom out).  The 8\" I just spoke could be off a little by + or - an inch.  The manual that could tell me for sure is over there in that box, and I am over here.  And I'm a lazy person.I'm really impressed at how small this camera is.  It will fit very nicely, with lots of room to spare, in my chest pocket.  I do wear a 2X shirt, but there is so much room left over, I bet you could fit this camera in a large size pocket.  I haven't had a chance to test it; I'm just using my best estimate.  On outings, being able to tuck this camera away in my pocket will be way awesome.  And it is so light weight.And it weighs very, very little for such a nice camera.  I have a cordless optical mouse hooked up to this computer.  So by comparing weight, the mouse is the more heavy of the two.I think I have touched on the biggest topics I can think of at this sitting, but to sum this up.  This is the best camera I (personally) have ever owned.  This would include 2 other digital cameras (one SLR type & one point and shoot) and a couple `film cameras' 110 and a 35mm SLR my uncle left to me.  And after comparing it with all the other ones available at the stores, it IS the best.  I compare every time a store has a display, to see if mine is still better.  Even some of the `better' SLR types that sell for $100's, fall short.  I would be really upset to see that a little `point & shoot' can beat my $800 `SLR type' camera.  At $225 and $25 3 year extended warranty from Samsclub, I have a new gizmo and I did not break the bank.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Great Little Camera", "Author": "nica \"nica\"", "ReviewID": "RLCE33B37XIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When you cannot or do not want to take your SLR, Take the SONY DSC-H55 instead. The range of features lets you take advantage of a wide variety of situations. In a darkened room with stage lights, the photos are well-balanced in color and contrast. Also, the movement is captured without blurring. The panoramic feature is great although it takes a little practice to \"get it right\" and not cut off the panorama too soon. HD video results in a nice capture of movement even for as short a period as 10 seconds but it does burn a lot of battery energy. Get yourself a spare.(I didn't but I will.) Macro shots are a little difficult to capture \"in the wild\" but indoors, nice photos can be captured. The 10X zoom is big improvement over 3-4X zoom. When I wanted details from a distance, I got them. Wide angle shots were good within limits. Size-wise, the camera fits in the smallest of pockets.

The photos with the flash at a normal distance come out too white.  There is no setting to adjust the strength of the flash.  The metering system gives a setting of overexposure.  At 0EV the graph curve is usually slightly to the right and the photo comes out overexposed.  I find myselft having to adjust the setting to -0.3EV or more to get the correct exposure.  This is the biggest problem with this camera, maybe it's a defective problem with the one I have.The nice feature is the panoramic feature where you can easily take a panoramic photo and it comes out really great.

And recently we bought this newer cybershot...NOT as a replacement, but we wanted the two new features: the 14.1 MP and the 180-landscape.We're disappointed.1) On Amazon, the camera listed the lens as CARL ZEISS...IT IS NOT...I went to the Sony website, found out the real facts, wrote Amazon, they updated the listing...and lss: the lens just is not the par of Zeiss...I know, I know, Sony says they did this, to me anyway, because it is equal quality...and maybe they'll say Zeiss makes it...but it's just not as crisp as our 10.1 or 12 cybershots with the Zeiss.2) The cameras focusing is slippery...whether I use auto focus and no matter how we set it up, there is NOT consistency in same shots as far as  how the shots are focused. Further, the lens makes a lot of noise trying to focus. Also, when videoing (forgetaboutit) much too much of my videos are blurry...again, the camera cannot focus. yes, even using the image stabilization we still get blurry shots or focus that is not on target (relying on the focus feature where the grid does show up on the LCD).3) The noise mentioned in #2...There is a slight, but discernable eletronic grinding noise...Sony via phone service was concerned...'this should not occur'  so I sent it in for service...I was called, SONY IS GREAT when it comes to service, and they said, 'this is normal'...so there you have it. I have a normally 'louder than no-sound' cybershot that doesn't focus well and makes a ton of noise.4) Inconsistent...of course #1 and #2 makes for inconsistent shots, BUT that's just plain irritating and disappointing...and it's NOT what Sony's known for ----so we're primarilly keeping with our older Sonys and only use this for the landscape mode, however NOTE...5) The landscape mode, which is very, very awesome in concept is just not implemented well yet. I'd not buy until maybe next or 3rd generation. The camera allows you to set your 180 swing to go from left-to-right, up-to-down or visa versa of either of these. GREAT concept...Further, the camera's smarts tell you when you're not doing the swing smoothly enough, per se, or perhaps you moved too much off the center and it will tell you, essentially it isn't taking the shot, and you can retry. Okay, sounds good. BUT there are times when I've taken the picture and the shot is broken into slices and so the photo is a long landscape, but with blank spots between portions of the whole image. This does not happen every time, but too many times and frankly, not what the camera should be doing. So again, \"DON'T DO IT...don't buy this version!\"We paid full retail from an Amazon dealer ($250)...and bummer, it's been serviced once, we were told there's nothing out of the norm' with our camera...and so, we have what Sony knows they produced...a bit sub-standard...and we're knowing it was more or less a loss of money.We say at this point if you really want to buy a Cybershot: DON'T buy this one. Get one with Carl Zeiss lens, and for now, stick to the old fashion way of making a huge landscape...many shots, and cut and paste in your choice of  photo management tool!

The reviewers gave it a high rating and I whole heartedly agree.  It takes great pictures and the zoom (10x) is really fantastic.  I have used the zoom to take a picture of a truck that I couldn't read the writing on.  The built-in flash is great. The 3\" screen let me read what was on the truck with ease. The panarama feature is really great. I took a picture of my yard from one side to the other by just standing in one spot in front of my house and turning.  The movie setting is also great.  I used it film my yard and gave audible discription of what I was looking at.  And I could zoom in while shooting the movie. Other reviewers mentioned noise when using the zoom when shooting movies but my camera didn't make any noise that I noticied.  Hope it stays that way.  You have to buy a memory stick separetly.  I bought an 8gb stick (by Lexar) and it works fine.  You can take movies that are just under 2 hrs. to over 5 hrs. depending on the picture size (you set the pic. size from the menu).  Remember that like everything else today, the manual you get with it is small and you need to download the disk that comes with the camera to get the full manual you can then read on the computer. The computer maual is really excellent. Everyone I showed the pics to (on the LCD screen) were extremly impressed.  Best money I've spent in long time!!  It only weighs 7.1 oz. w/ battery.

My wife first bought the Sony and was happy until she shot some video. We next tried the Panasonic. They both are very close in the photo results. In normal light and 1 to 3X focal length, they are for the most part equal with Sony having the edge. At max telephoto the sharper lens of the Panasonic makes itself known. In poor light the Sony is very soft and the Panasonic is sharper but noisier. If you don't use either camera for video they are quite close. Now video is another matter. Here it is straight from the properties from a clip from each camera. The Sony records at 1280x720 data rate 9,148 29 frames/second. The Panasonic records at 1280x720 data rate 31,168 30 frames/second. Sony uses MP4 and Panasonic uses MOV. Sony's video is good only for video sharing, moving video to MP4 devices and the like, a lot of pixilation. Shown on a large 16x9 LCD display it is worse than a good SD video. We did not look at the Canon because they lock out the zoom when shooting video. The Panasonic focus while zooming is quite good. There is some zoom noise but it is low. I would recommend a bridge camera if you can get by with the larger size and greater cost as the P/S large telephoto lens/sensor are just too much of a compromise.  In summary, Sony photo 3.6 stars and Panasonic 3.5 stars. Sony video 1 star and Panasonic video 4 stars. Best P/S I've seen is the Canon SD780 IS 3X telephoto.

What a great difference this camera is in settings, ease of use and it takes great photos.I did a lot of research, read tons of reviews and went to the store to look at many different point and shoot cameras to replace my old Sony camera. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H55 was my choice and I am very happy with my decision.The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H55 is very easy to use. The iAuto setting automatically optimizes camera settings and works great. If you don't want to mess around with learning all of the options the iAuto setting will work fine for your needs. I have taken pictures in almost complete darkness that came out perfect without too much brightness from the flash to cause a \"white out\" effect.I love the 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom which really allows me the ability to get a close up photo from a distance. My prior Sony Cyber-shot only had a 4x zoom and the 10x zoom is so much better. This was a huge factor for me when I bought this camera and I have not been disappointed.The Sweep Panorama Mode takes awesome photos but can take some practice to use correctly. The 14.1-megapixel allows you to take excellent and clear shots that can be blown up to a large size photo of 16\"x20\" with great clarity and quality.The HD video quality has been great. One feature that I really like is that you can zoom while taking video. Some of the older Cyber-shots do not have this ability. But, if you zoom while taking video you will hear the noise from the lens moving in your video. Not a huge deal but it is a factor when shooting video.There is a card slot for optional Memory Stick Duo media and SD media. I currently use a 4GB Sandisk Secure Digital SD HC Memory Card which holds about 1,207 pictures when the camera is set for the highest resolution. If you lower the resolution it can hold thousands of more photos.Battery life has been awesome and I have not had any issues with the battery dying too soon. I did purchase a spare battery as a backup. I would hate to lose the opportunity for great photos due to a dead battery.The one compliant that I have with this camera is that the battery door seems fragile and very easy to break so use extra caution when putting in the battery. Again, not a deal breaker but extra caution is needed. Also, there is a slight pause when you take photos but this seems to be a common factor with most of the point and shoot cameras.I definitely recommend the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H55 14.1MP Digital Camera for its ease of use and great picture quality.

Well this does have a lot of features but no matter how many endless combinations I tried, they just did not produce a good image in low light or using a flash. Everything was either too bright or too blurry, wrong color tint or over saturated.Basically it just does not look natural. Outdoor photos look decent but nothing special. Even the cheapest point and shoot would look respectable. This does not.I'm very particular about the quality of an image but even a casual observer can tell many of the pictures I've taken are not even close to halfway acceptable.

However, it may have got sand in it and it may be that I just need to clean it.This new 10x optical and 14.1MP camera is top of the line. Most every picture came out well, during the first shot, and I was easily able to use the panoramic feature without reading the manual.  It is a bit larger than the 7.2MP camera, and a bit larger than my Nikon Coolpix S570.The battery life went from 50% down to ZERO without notice and that would have negatively impacted me if I had not been traveling with a spare one.  But it did take longer than expected to get down to 50%.  I was happy that the same battery used for their 7.2MP camera also worked in the 14.1MP version.The flash worked well, but often it is not even needed.I did not use most of the features of the camera because the automatic functions met most of my needs.If my camera were stolen or lost, I would definitely buy this same model again, and I would strongly recommend the same camera to my friends, family, and coworkers.

The key phrase here is \"easily-portable\".  I realized going in I was going to be making a few compromises as a result of buying something so small, but I didn't end up making as many as I thought.So far, the things I've liked most about this camera are:1) Easily portable (fits in a jacket/jeans pocket)2) 10x optical zoom is nice and maybe its strongest feature.3) Decent array of settings to appeal to those who want to take more than just 'snapshots'.The only drawbacks, really are the following:1) The battery/memory card door is pretty flimsy and comes open a bit too easily.  Not a huge deal but a minor annoyance.2) The controls are all fairly tiny and a bit flimsy.3) The flash is nothing to write home about and tends to wash things out a bit.4) There's a noticeable delay when in manual focus mode between depressing the shutter and the image being captured.Others have complained about the exposure in low-light settings.  While I agree the camera takes a little bit of work indoors as opposed to outside on a clear day, I was able to get pretty good images after playing around a bit in manual focus mode and resetting the white balance.  However, if you just want a point-and-shoot and don't ever plan to move the camera out of the \"easy\" modes, this could be a concern for you.To be sure, you can definitely find bigger cameras out there that take great pictures and have a lot of bells and whistles.

After using the H55 model, I can see that like most Sony cameras, it does fine taking photos in daylight and bright light or outdoor settings.However, I've taken this camera to several concerts, which always poses a challenge to Sony cameras - with the H55, under low light conditions, there is more noise and with some of my concert photos, there is a strange purple haze that makes everything and everybody look purple.  I noticed this while taking a photo at a concert, I could see even on the LCD screen that the people on the other side of the arena from us were looking like a purple blob in the background.  It looked the same when I opened the photo on my computer.  My Sony DSC-H20 never did anything like this!There is also generally just more noise and graininess with the H55 in low light.  It also still has the same flaw as the H20 model, which is that it has a hard time capturing any movement, whether it's a moving cat, moving child, moving rock singer, etc.  My little Canon SD1200 camera can capture moving things better than either of these Sonys!When browsing the sample images posted at Amazon, many people here post a lot of landscape pictures, and they are so pretty.  Any digital camera can capture landscape, the real test is whether it can capture people and pets who are not perfectly still all the time.  Sony cameras always seem to fail in this area.On the bright side, it does make a good video camera, the sound quality on both models is excellent.  One good thing about the Sony digital cameras is their video modes DO have great sound quality, probably the best for filming things like concerts. I've seen YT videos from concerts filmed with Canon and Panasonoc models, and the sound is not as good - Panasonics sound more muted, and with many Canons, the reverb and static is awful!BUT BEWARE: On the H55 model, if using the zoom lens while filming, the sound will go down (not totally mute, but just lower) while zooming in and out.  This is very noticeable when filming at a concert for example.  I filmed a really good song at the Bon Jovi show while using the H55 for the first time & didn't realize until after I got home & saw all my videos what the sound was doing.  It's pretty noticeable, and really annoying.  Luckily for me, I had used my old H20 for most of my video clips, so all was well.So it looks like my search for a good all around P&S; with a bigger zoom lens will have to continue.

Trying to take pictures that involved motion almost never worked out. I did have the best luck with outdoor pictures with natural lighting. Another issue was the location of the flash. You had to constantly make sure your finger did not block it.

The image quality on the lcd is very good; the actual image on the computer is less stellar but for around $150, I can't really complain.  I am used to DSLR cameras and nothing compares to the image quality of a bigger sensor with better lenses.  The Sony H55 takes very good snapshots and the exposures are accurate.  I take very few flash photos and don't like to take images in dark environments since the flash usually destroys the scene so I can't comment on how the flash works.  I enjoy using the panorama stitching mode for an extreme wide angle look - it has very quick rendering and is simple to use.  Sony phone support told me that \"some SD cards cannot be used with this camera\" when I called and reported an error reading two brand new 8 gb Sandisk SD cards I bought specifically for it.  Had to back down to a 4gb card... I guess they really want you to use their proprietary memory sticks... The HD video is clean although the multi-cable usb cord interface is way too bulky to pack with the camera unless you get a huge bag; the sound is what can be expected with a small microphone on the side of the camera.  I use this camera for snapshots and ebay seller images.  Overall, Sony has done a good job with this camera and I recommend it to anyone who needs a simple camera for outdoor shots and indoor no flash images.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love the camera but-----", "Author": "lynn21", "ReviewID": "R1I5NA5MVKT8P5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love the ease of this camera.

This is probably the most disappointing electronics/technology purchase I have ever made, and that includes my experience with Windows Vista!  This camera is not much better than the camera in my Blackberry.  No joke.  This was purchased to replace a Sony DSC W35.  The old technology was head and shoulders above this camers.  This camera has lots of features, some of them are very nice, but the picture quality is abyssmal.  The panorama function is nice, but the results are very grainy and useless for enlargement or printing.  Low light performance is SHOCKINGLY poor.  The noise in low light is terrible.  There is a focus issue as well, particularly in low light.  The lens is excellent, but the sensor stinks.  Program modes are not reliable.  Color saturation is unpredicable.  Flash is near useless.  LCD is useless in outside light.  There is no viewfinder.  This camera is incredibly underwhelming.  If you want to see a comparison of the quality of this camera and the old 7 MP DSC W35, go to my smugmug account at [...].  Look at the album called Lonely Ride.  The last 3/4 of the pictures in that album were taken with this camera.  You will see very poor quality, and even these are the best of the best this camera can take.  Over 50% of the photos on that trip  were discarded because of poor quality.  Next, look at any album entitled El Paseo Mexicano (there are 5 or 6 of them).  Compare the quality.  El Paseo Mexicano was taken with the cheap, 7 mp camera.  It is light years better than this piece of junk.  Do not buy a DSC H55 unless you can live with cell phone camera quality pictures.  Do not be mislead by the 14 MP label.  This camera is junk quality.  If you are budget constrained, you will do much better with a DSC W150, for the same money.  You won't have panorame, you wont have as good of a lens, but you will get focused, sharp, predictable pictures.  With this piece of junk, getting a good photo is only a 10% probability.  With the DSC W150, the odds increase to about 80% or more.  Sony should be ashamed to release a product that this inferior.

Unfortunately it captures the full (3 image?) pan frame in half the memory space of one regular photo, so pan photos were a little grainy when viewed under zoom.Video quality was superb, best ever on a pocket camera for this reviewer. Even in low light concert situations it surpassed expectations. Speaking of concerts though, zooming while recording did cause very noticeable background noise and an accompanying drop in audio quality.Picture quality was standard for a mid-range point and shoot. Not amazingly sharp and a slight difficulty capturing off the cuff motion shots, but definitely more than acceptable for most uses.And the bad - Two weeks into ownership I went to turn it on. Still on the original battery charge, no drops, dust or water, no likely cause for any damage whatsoever. Screen says, \"Turn power off and turn on again\", or something like. I do, many times, to the same result. Tried charging the battery, no difference. Took it back to the big W and got the impression from the clerk this wasn't the first return they had seen.Big, big red flag there.

With this in mind, there were a few minor features, like the ability to zoom while taking a video, that I looked for in each camera I considered.  I finally decided to buy this model (about 7 months ago), and I have to say it is the best camera I have ever owned.  The pictures almost always come out crystal clear, and the videos are smooth and with excellent audio quality.  It met and surpassed all my expectations.  The Intelligent Audo mode is great for everyday use, and the image stabilization works very well.  One feature I particularly like is that when you take a picture in some low-light settings the camera snaps two pictures, each sith different settings, and lets you choose which one is the best.  I also like the panorama mode.  I have not used the Program and Manual modes, but they appear to offer plenty of customization options to more professional photographers.  I only have two minor complaints about the camera:1.  The microphone is on the top of the camera, so it's easy to accidentally cover it with your finger when shooting a video.2.  When using the panorama mode, if your picture does not use up the entire panorama view the rest of it is left gray.  I'm not sure why the camera doesn't automatically trim off the extra space.Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to any potential buyer, whether they're a simple point-and-shoot user or a more experienced user who wants plenty of flexibility to tweak a variety of settings.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE this camera!", "Author": "xnana21x", "ReviewID": "R1Z038F3PA6PB5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned 2 Sony Camera's before this one.

There are a few things that have changed in the layout of the menus than my older model, but for the most part it was easy to pick up and use.Best part is that Sony cameras all take the same battery, so for my Europe trip last week I took my old and new batteries, which I switched between, allowing me to charge one while I used the other.All in all, a good buy, just wish they had the color setting they had before.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressive Camera", "Author": "Kenneth G.

Even using a tripod makes photo taking with this camera almost impossible (I tried). I have to shop the ever-loving 4311 out of every photo just to fix the color balance, as everything is either orange or green. Most of the picture I take of my kids has them motion blurred. Of the photos where my older daughter will sit still, we got good results. We also got good results when my baby would sit still. Unfortunately, that takes about 100 tries just to get 2-3 usable and non-blurry pictures. There is almost no control on settings- I have it set to 800ISO and turned \"smile recognition\" down to \"barely\" so that it wouldn't wait until it saw a smile (its idea of \"smile\" and mine are vastly different it seems)- but that's about it.I did not have this problem with my Cannon which had a \"children/pets\" setting. This camera has a \"pets\" setting, but I'm not sure exactly how it's different from any of the other settings other than nighttime, which turns everything green. It also will auto correct to \"twilight\" in any lighting other than flood lights (we use two 100watt floor lamps, a 100watt halogen and two 40watt table lamps just to get the camera to take pictures that aren't grainy messes) or direct sunlight. The middle of the day in my living room is apparently \"twilight\" (unless we use aforesaid lighting) and receives the green treatment. It takes forever to focus, and once your subject moves it goes out of focus to an almost comical degree. The camera likes to wait until it thinks the photo is \"optimal\", which means that it will not actually take a photo when you press the button (sometimes several seconds later after the baby has crawled off), so you lose baby smiles and sibling hugs/kisses entirely.I tried to use the camera in low-light setting in order to take photos of lights in a dim room (candles with only a table lamp to get the low light), and they didn't even show up. I got a solid black grainy background with a white circle of indistinguishable grainy light and vague outlines.If you like to set up a brightly lit studio with solid same-depth backgrounds and shoot perfectly posed and still subjects- this camera may work for you.

I never trust what they claim for a zoom factor anymore.The first thing I do when I am trying out a camera is turn off the digital zoom. It's worthless. It can't take the place of resolution. Any photo editing program can give you \"digital\" zoom after you've taken the picture.To determine how the zoom really looks, I put the camera up in one hand, zoom it in on something far away as far as it will go, and compare the image frame with what my eye sees.  On full zoom, this camera manages to get images slightly bigger than what my eye sees. Zooming out, it can make things look almost microscopic.Pros:---------------------------------------------------CMOS does better in low-light settings, hands down. 'Nuf said.Very compact size for such a large zoom factor.Small enough for travel.Zeiss lenses - the best IMHO.Built-in lens cover that automatically closes and opens for you. No more dangling lens cap!Panoramic feature is really pretty good, provided there isn't a lot of movement (on your part or the camera frame) when you take the picture. The picture doesn't look hardly distorted or \"fish-eyed\" either.Sony didn't change much on the controls. I'm glad for that as I hate having to learn a new system on every camera I own.-----------------------------------------------------------------Cons;14 megapixels. Why, you ask, do I say this is a con?  Average 35mm film is about the equivalent of 8 megapixels.  Having super-high resolution only takes up more memory without really giving you a noticeably better picture, especially if you are printing out 5 x 7's or smaller. I wish I could have found a 10 megapixel camera with twice as much zoom.I cannot get a good focus in macro mode using the \"intelligent auto mode.\" It makes no sense to me. My other digital cameras do not have this issue.  I can put them in \"macro\" mode, and zoom in so that the object fills the frame, and it will auto focus.  This camera won't do that. Instead, when I zoom in on the item, it gets blurry and won't focus no matter how close or far away the object is. So I back it out to wide angle mode, hold the object closer, and then the camera focuses and I get the picture I wanted. What is the point of macro mode when it won't focus on objects within 2 feet?------------------------------------------------------------------Overall: I'm glad I bought it, even if the zoom is disappointing. The panoramic feature has worked out well for me so far.It will be great when traveling because it is really compact.Now if I could find a camera that acts like an SLR, but is the size of a pocket camera, with at least 10 megapix, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Worth Getting", "Author": "D.
