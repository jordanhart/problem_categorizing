Haithcock", "ReviewID": "R3P25H6W8U7Y7C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "\"You can start shooting the minute you pull the a544 by Polaroid out of the box.\"Um... yeah, but what you're shooting is likely to be really fuzzy. The shutter speed is slower than expected, leaving the unit particularly prone to jitter. The zoom is awkward to use and nowhere near as useful as you'd think. It also had some unexpected 'quirks', like the unit blanking the memory card when you unhook it from your computer whether you'd copied the files off or not. The red-eye correction is a joke.This unit was bought for my niece for a photography course she's taking in high school. As such, it meets the requirements, but it's simply not a unit that'll have a lot of usefulness after the course is over. I honestly expected more, and was disappointed in this unit. It's cute, but cute doesn't cut it.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "okay, but not the best", "Author": "Courtney Cecil \"CC\"", "ReviewID": "RR9U4RMRINRQD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I picked up this camera, because I was going on vacation, and needed another camera. The price was good, that if I lost it or it broke I wouldn't worry about replacing it.It's not the best (I love my moms samsung), but it's good if you want something you don't have to worry about...Make sure you turn the flash off for daytime or if your inside with lights on. Keep it on the landscape setting (button on the left side keep it down), because if you put it on portrait the pictures will be fuzzy. You can then go into the menu, and change the scene mode.. If you do it that way the pictures are much better. Also turning the flash off saves on the battery power. It doesn't hold many pictures so make sure you have a memory card.Over all this camera would be a good camera for kids, or if you just wanted a cheap back up camera.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent camera, but not the best", "Author": "shell412", "ReviewID": "R2XUFOB9DRM34V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought this camera for our daughter, and it works fine for her use.
