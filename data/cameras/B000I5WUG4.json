I got this as a gift for my daughter's birthday and when she got it the camera did not work at all. I told Amazon and they told me to contact the seller first, so I did. Three times and still have not heard anything. I filed an Amazon 100% guarantee claim and have to wait until the 20th to get anything I guess. Meanwhile, my daughter's birthday was over a month ago.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Unsatisfactory experience", "Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "REAXATZAQERYO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I never even received this camera, as it was already sold prior to my placing my order.  I was never informed of the prior sale until 3 weeks had passed when I made an inquiry of the seller.  According to seller, the listing should have been immediately removed once it had been sold, but it wasn't and the seller said he did not understand how this happened.  I think I should have been informed immediately of the prior sale.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "used at $11, it's perfect. Takes excellent pix, and it's fast.", "Author": "smedley", "ReviewID": "RSO5UK2B7D1ON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It used a XD card that I had to pay $35 for so that tainted the process somewhat, but we love the camera.I had a Fujifilm Finepix camera that I paid about $125 for that we loved, but it was stolen. We bought another Fujifilm Finepix 2800HD for about $150 and WE HATE IT. I'd give it away almost. It takes sooooo loooong to take a pix. I was at the Indey 500 track and took about 50 pix of cars going by. I ended up with 2 pix of cars and 48 pix of the fence. You had to push the shutter button about 2 seconds b4 the car got there. Fujifilm should recall those.Sorry to sadden the review of the Fuji Finepix S3000. It is a nice camera. We love it.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "the new FinePix S3000 Zoom combines simplicity and optical power in an SLR-style silver package\nSLR-type Dimensions (WxDxH) 3.9 in x 2.7 in x 3\nThe FinePix S3000 Zoom joins Fujifilm's sharp new family of compact and powerful zoom cameras\nThis model retains its predecessor's rugged good looks\nOffers newcomers to digital photography a chance to achieve more with their camera", "Name": "Fuji FinePix S3000 3.2 Megapixel Digital Camera with 6x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31D07WR2Q5L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000I5WUG4"}}
