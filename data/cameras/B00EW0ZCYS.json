I had been using an old Kodak 530 digital camera with a docking system to down load pictures. Kodak in their wisdom quit supporting their camera and software leaving people like me who update their PCs to a newer version basically lost (a scr word would have defined better) but there was no software updates. The Canon was great, easy to program, easy to set up even for an old guy like me. The mini tripod is interesting don't really know where I might use that but the Canon attached right on to my \"adult\" size tripod and works extremely well. Two Thumbs Up!! Great Camera, great price, very happy", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "great gifts for small prices", "Author": "cynthia Ross", "ReviewID": "R503S2ISC1M51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is a great camera at a great deal .
