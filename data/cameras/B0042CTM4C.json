{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good spycam floodlight", "Author": "Debbi's", "ReviewID": "R36B51NYH51QXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am pleased with this product and the price.  I set the camera, lights, and audio to turn on/record when motion was detected except for daytime when I set it for only the camera and audio to turn on/record. It's really nice having the options of the different settings.  It was relatively easy to assemble, program, and install.  Considering I'm a 50-year old mother of three, I had no difficulty installing it in place of the flood light over our garage.  I like the way you can position the lights and the motion sensor/camera to just about any position you want.  It was also easy to remove the memory card, an allen wrench is supplied to open and close the cover, and of course a ladder was necessary since I installed it above the garage.  The videos were crystal clear when I viewed them on the computer.  I don't know yet if the memory card (2gb) that comes with it will have sufficient space, but so far so good.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Purchased to catch people trying to break into neighborhood cars.

When they find unlocked cars, they grab anything of value. Our car was broken into last year, which spurred the purchase of this item. I purchased this camera/light to get them on video for the cops. However, the video is not very good quality at night, and there is bad interference from the lights which made them unrecognizable from just 23 feet away!The other down side to this camera is that you cannot select the camera to work only at night. The lights are the only part that can be set to run only at night. This is bad for us since our dog is outside during the day. I get on average, 50 videos a day of my dog running around. Since the camera records over the oldest footage, the life of the card is greatly reduced in terms of recording night time intruder footage. It is possible that burglar footage has been lost due to this feature.I am including pictures and videos of the referenced video so you can see how poor of a job this camera really does!", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "SmartGuard + Eye-Fi", "Author": "JT", "ReviewID": "RIWSWU7NLKGCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just installed my SmartGuard E120CA-1. All seems to be well, with so-so instructions. But things are so simple you really don't need much of that.The problem lies here: It's a hassile every time you need to view the content on the SD card, you need to grab that funky wrench, open the access panel, remove the SD card and bring it to your computer to see the video clips. SO, I tried to be smart and stick an Eye-Fi card (Connect X2 4GB) in there, thinking I can retrive all the captured video wirelessly, and therefore no more disassembly before viewing any video. Well, it did not work. This camera is recording in ASF format, and seems like Eye-Fi is not supporting it. I understand this is not a problem from the SmartGuard itself, but are there anyone out there that have experience in dealing with this and willing to help?Many thanks in advance.", "Date": "August

I comes complete with everything you need. The product installs in just minutes and set-up is a snap. Packed extremely well, ships lightening fast. The product records activity so that you can review it and turn it over to the police if need be. A picture is worth a thousand words and I could write more about this product. However, incredible and amazing works just fine. Congrats to the vendor and Amazon once again.

It came about a week ago and I installed it right away.  For the price, you can't beat it.  It cost about twice as much as a motion light without a camera.  The pictures are very good and the light comes on at night when there is a motion too.It was just a little confusing to set it up, but not too bad.  The mounting plate wouldn't fit my existing junction box.  All I needed to do is cut some of the plastic away from the mounting holes and that problem was solved.  I have tried single shot, burst and video.  I can't decide between the burst and the video, both are good.  I downloaded the pictures directly from the camera onto my laptop with the provided cable.  It couldn't have been easier.  I didn't want to remove the SD card because the instructions said I had to shut off the power to do so.  Shutting off the power means that you have to reset the date, time etc...  I put in a new 1GB SD card that I had which may fill up in 2 weeks with all the times somebody walks by it.No problem with that, it should just put the new pictures in the spots where the oldest ones were.  If there was a burglary we would check the card before the pictures or videos were replaced.  A note about SD cards, they are now selling a lot of SDHC card.  They don't work in many products that require SD only.  I am not sure if that is the case with the Smartguard Security Lighting Camera, just use a regular SD to be sure.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Expensive Piece of Junk", "Author": "Marlene G", "ReviewID": "R1AYK8TIRWMB2Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My advice is Do Not Buy this light.

I had a bugler trolling through my carport in the early morning hours recently.  My pick-up truck was not locked and the vandal ransacked the center console and other compartments in the truck.  Fortunately,  I did not leave any item of major value in the truck and it was not damaged.  I felt so vulnerable that I searched the internet and found this security device.  I installed the device and placed it on a digital electric timer and set it to activate from 12a.m. to 6a.m. nightly.  The system operates in the default mode when the timer powers it up. And fortunately, these default setting perform all the major functions desired by me.  After an initial warm-up period when powered up by the timer, the system is armed to light up, sound an alarm, and do video surveillance when the motion detector is set off.  I didn't need to use any back-up batteries and I can disarm or activate the system at any time by manually switching the electric timer on or off.  And if I need to be in the carport after 12a.m. then I simply shut off the power to the system temporarily and then reactivate it again from the timer located securely in my covered garage next to the carport monitoring area.  I can do multiple settings of my timer during the week and on week-ends as needed.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0042CTM4C"}}
