I ordered the Samsung WB1100F in red for my trip to Cairo, Egypt in less than a week, My initial thoughts are as follows:I wanted a camera with wifi so I could post pictures on the run. I have a hotspot so wifi is always available. After opening the box and playing around with buttons I took my first picture. I have the cutest puppy in the world and I need to share her perfect face with the facebook world. I snapped the picture and went to task to post the picture asap! (I hate instruction books) so I fumbled my way through the setup process. I have to say it went rather well. I personally find the camera intuitive. I was setup and logged in to facebook in just a few short minutes. Then BAM! My picture was posted for the world to see.The picture itself was awesome. The zoom is very good and the lens picked up all the adorable features of Chi Chi's face.Again this is just a quick one off review. I will be back in a couple of weeks to tell you all about Egypt and the (hopefully) amazing pictures and videos I took!", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lots of technology - great images!", "Author": "Richard F. Koning", "ReviewID": "R1AAHC3X0815KJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the camera for over a month now and everything works just fine.  I was a bit nervous about all of the technology integrated in the camera, but am pleased with the performance and ease of use.  The camera takes incredible pictures -- images are sharp and impressive.  The telephoto-style lens is terrific for a camera at this price, but you will encounter 'shake' issues at the longest setting, blurring the image somewhat.  The WiFi features and technology/app pairing it with my Samsung mobile phone work well.  I can easily email pictures directly to my PC or cloud storage without removing the memory card -- a great function.  The reason I gave this camera a 4-star rating is the problem with extreme glare in the display on the rear of the camera.  It's nearly impossible to frame your picture on a sunny day.  The camera doesn't have a view finder and the use of the display is a must.  I would suggest that Samsung give their next generation a basic viewfinder to assist in setting up the shot in glare conditions.  I would recommend this camera.  You get a lot of features at this price.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simply awesome!", "Author": "RkyMtGirl", "ReviewID": "R239GS0ET4H0MG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't have any pre-conceived  idea of what this camera would be, so when I had it out of the box and taking pictures within minutes, I was pleasantly surprised.  Easy to use and takes excellent pictures.  The wifi feature is awesome as I take a great deal of still photos in my home.  I can also transfer them to my phone with just a 'bump'!  Highly recommend for those that like a point and shoot but also the bulk feel of the DSLR.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesomeness", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R7TN7IV2V89UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome camera!
