{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Video aspect seems fine, audio not so much", "Author": "Scott Smith", "ReviewID": "RURQJ5Y78Z6UB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We replaced our audio only monitor with this monitor recently.  To ensure we could see the entire crib, we had to mount it on the wall about 3-4 feet above on an angle down.  Should be plenty close to have good audio reception (these should pick up anything in the room in my opinion).  Unfortunately, we can barely hear unless our baby is actually crying.  Rustling and slight noises are almost non-existent and crying is still so quiet it we can sometimes not even notice.  Our audio monitor picked up sound and transmitted it at a much higher volume.  It sucks, because this was a good price and had good reviews so we were really hopeful it would work well for us.  Will be returning shortly.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "finally a great monitor", "Author": "hopefullyitsgood", "ReviewID": "R27TB9BF1WTR23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our fourth baby, so you can imagine we have gone through a few monitors.

I took a risk and it turned out to be great!  The battery lasts about 5 solid hours, which is fine because I just plug it in where ever I am.  It comes with night vision, lullaby's and an sd card so you can record what's on the screen.  The only thing is that I wanted a monitor that I could move, to the right or left, as the baby moves.  But I have to go in and adjust it myself.  It is fine though because I raised it high enough in the room that it captures the whole room!  Wonderful product!", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for the price I paid for it", "Author": "jilly", "ReviewID": "R304CQD2ZAGQBB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this monitor when it was $64.99, and now the price has increased to $179.99.  I definitely think it is well worth what I paid, but I wouldn't pay the new price.  The picture is good.  I have the monitor mounted to the wall and I can see the entire crib.  I can't tell if baby has her eyes closed or not bc it doesn't zoom, but I can see if she's still or thrashing about.  I don't pick up any sound on it though so I have my sound monitor in there as well. The night vision is good as well.  I would recommend it for the price I paid, but not for over $100.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works as promised, no problems so far. Records to SD card!", "Author": "GeorgiaGeekGuy", "ReviewID": "R1107IQDPSIAPE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of the few that can RECORD (and to a regular SD card!)The range seems fine (camera downstairs, viewer upstairs, no problems). No interference with my cordless phones or wi-fi router.I wish it had motion detection auto-recording (I knew it didn't when I bought it), but it can be set to record when it hears a loud enough sound. I think there are 2 sound levels you can choose from. On either setting, the sound has to be sorta loud, such as (duh) a baby crying) for it to start auto-recording.I got this here on Amazon for under 70 bucks. It is definitely worth that, but I wouldn't pay over 99 dollars for it. There are also standalone First Alert cameras available that work with this monitor, should you need a second one or to replace the original one.Overall am pleased, and hope it lasts a couple years or more.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad experience", "Author": "FabMA", "ReviewID": "R2WKULY7SP842F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently recieved the package however it contained an add on camera instead of the monitor/camera set I bought.

The only thing I wish was different is the mounting for the camera. We just strapped it to one of the bars of the crib with zip ties.
