But taking advantage of all the options requires wading through a 315 page instruction manual that could be clearer.  Features not used frequently will probably be lost to one's memory as nested menus and icons can only do so much.  Many of the accessories packaged for the G15 such as the tripod were small and made a flimsy impression -- in hindsight it might have been better to take the time to buy quality accessories individually.  The promised  memory card was missing.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot G15", "Author": "Susan Wilde", "ReviewID": "R2LEJ99QNB8XUR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Camera was just what I wanted.
