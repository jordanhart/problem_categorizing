I have been doing store surveys on hurricane damaged stores, so I need a camera that was easy to use, easy to carry, and  could take good detailed pictures.  I decided on a kodak because I like to size of it and I had SD memory cards already.  I like that it is so easy to use, if you need to take a picture that is a lower quality pictures so it is easier to email, it only take a few seconds to change it on the camera.  The camera will easily fit in a shirt pocket.  It takes quality pictures, and you do not have to be perfectly still, the pictures come out great.  I use the camera with the screen cut off, so I can save the 2 AA batteries.  I have taken over 100 pictures, reviewed them, and transfered them to my laptop on a single set of batteries.Overall if you want a easy to use camera, that will not cost you an arm and a leg this is a great little camera to think about.", "Date": "November 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Compact, Inexpensive and Works Well: Your Camera is Here!!", "Author": "Roy Chan", "ReviewID": "R1NQ0UQ27QZ558", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must admit that this is a very simple to shoot and easy to share Digital Camera that lets you capture eye-catching images. With this camera, I have been able to get an effective MP CCD that generates high-resolution images for up to 20\" x 30\" prints. The 1.6\" high-resolution display lets me view brilliant, sharp pictures with ease and clarity. One thing I like is that it includes the Kodak EasyShare software, which works seamlessly with the C310 and allows you to edit, organize, print or view a slide show from your computer. Another great feature is the on-camera share button which allows me to email my pictures to my friends or print them directly to share them with my family. Along with images, I can shoot continuous video at 20 fps at resolutions of up to 320x240 pixels. Compact and lightweight, the Kodak EasyShare C310 is an ideal way to share your life's special moments.

We got it from Wal-Mart for under $100. It is a great camera for kids to start out with. It is pretty much point and shoot, very few options. The biggest plus is the quick shutter time. To try it out I took pictures of my husband waving his hands - it came out clear. I even  took a picture of my ceiling fan that was on and it came out as a blade with no blurriness. My last trial pic was an up close pic where I got within 8\" of a slipper - once again it came out very clear. For the money you just can't beat the shutter speed and clear pics. We appreciate the lack of buttons/gadgets which will make this much easier for our daughter to use.", "Date": "November 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "KES", "ReviewID": "R1LPUKFZFXUCUZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the KODAK Easyshare C310 as my first digital camera and I must admit, I'm very impressed with it.

Lawrence \"Bob Lawrence\"", "ReviewID": "R17CQW4H2OR1Q0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera for my 9 year old daughter. I wanted a digital camera that she could take to Girl Scout camp. In the past we bought disposable film cameras but she found the flash on most too difficult and we ended up paying for dark murky pictures. She also missed a lot of good shots because she \"didn't want to waste her film\". I loaded this camera with an inexpensive 512MB SD card and she took over 200 shots. Most of them were pretty decent. Since they are digital I can easily crop them and print only the ones that we want. The flash on this camera worked flawlessly. Another great thing about sending a digital camera to camp was that we took some pictures of my wife and me and our pets and left them on the memory card. Our daughter was able to go back and look at them on the LCD when she got homesick! I also own a Kodak P850. It's a great camera  with great features.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Exactly What I Need!", "Author": "bblhed \"bblhed\"", "ReviewID": "R1CWESRIQY533I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only gave this 4 stars because what I need in a camera may not be what you need in a camera.This baby is about as point and shoot as it gets. For those of us that grew up on 110 and 126 cameras, this is the camera you may be looking for. I was able to set up the printer without ever looking at the instructions, I had everything set up, and I had taken and printed a test photo within 20 minutes of opening the box, I will add that it was harder for me to open the box than hook up the printer, dock, and camera.One of the main reasons I bought this setup is because I am into a lot of outdoor activities and I wanted a camera that could do a few things. The camera had to be semi durable with as few moving parts as possible this has that. I wanted a lens that did not stick out of the front of the camera at all so I can put the camera in a dry-bag and take pictures, this has that also.One aside note of personal philosophy on digital pictures and why they come out dark. Maybe we have forgotten this, but we all have taken lots of dark film photos over the years. Film is a bit forgiving because the person developing it can brighten a photo a bit for you (sort of the way you can with photo shop). The good thing about digital is that you know right then that the picture was bad, but with film by the time you get back the dark photos you forgot what they were of anyway. I recommend using a flash whenever you can and try to be less than 8' form what you are trying to photograph if it is dark.", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!", "Author": "N.

Whenever I buy something for my family, I always go to amazon.com first before purchasing a product, the reviews ALWAYS help! Anyway, my sons are almost 7, 5 and almost 2.  My 7 and 5 year old son kept talking about getting a  digital camera all last year.  Finally the long wait came at Christmas day.  My husband did alot of research on cameras and all the kids camera reviews were poor, for they didn't last long and felt it wasn't worth the money to spend a cheap camera for them.  We bought a different kind of camera through Amazon, but when we got the product, it was too cheap, the buttons were impossible to push and the battery life was 5 minutes! Immediately we returned that product.  After doing research we were down to the Kodak C300 or C310.  We didn't buy Kodak C310 through Amazon, there was an awesome sale at Best Buy for this camera for $119.00 and we got a free Kodak Camera Dock Series 3 set ($70 retail value!) for this purchase!  It came with a camera dock, camera case, rechargeable battery and a tripod! This was the after Christmas sale 2005.I HIGHLY recommend this camera for kids who are ready for the real thing, after all younger children(ages 5 and up) are getting into the technology alot sooner than I did when I was their age. This camera is very simple, easy to follow and they are experts at it already after a week of using it.  The buttons are easy to follow (although, I think it helped that we already had a Kodak DX6490 camera, that they used from time to time) It prepared them to know how to use it.  We just ordered a new Kodak 64mb SD through amazon so they can take more pictures and take it to Costco to get prints!I am very pleased with this product and look forward to seeing what they take and how proud they are when they take these pictures! :) Happy New Year! Hope this helped you all out!

Since then I have purchased various other AA brands with the same results.  Rechargable, top of the line, kodak brand it doesn't matter.  Camera shuts off after about 2 minutes of use each time.  I then have to take out the batteries and reinsert to get another 2 minutes.  The kodak brand was the only brand of batteries I could get to do even this.  sorta of a ripoff because by the time I discovered this problem I had already thrown away the packaging and receipt, so return is not an option.  After a bit of research I have also confirmed that this is a pretty common problem.  This is the sort of camera that people with tight budgets are going to buy when they want something a little nicer.

Very easy to use, with some handy features. It will give you very nice shots at the five to twenty foot range, e.g. at a birthday party or an outdoor cookout.  It's OK too for urban street scenes.  But for \"grand vista\" outdoor scenes, e.g. from a mountain top lookout, or even a sports event, it's not the right camera.  For that you need a variable-focus.  Thus, it really isn't a vacation trip camera, unless  you're going to London or Paris (lucky you) and will be shooting mostly street scenes. The 5X digital zoom only gives you decent results up thru 2X; past that, things blur quickly.  In fact, there is an zoom indicator box on the LED that goes from blue to red when picture quality goes below what a decent 4x6 print would require -- this happens between 2 and 3X.  (Still, 2X comes in handy sometimes).  One more thing, the Kodak EasyShare software package may be right for you, but I personally didn't want it, given what the full version takes up in computer space and resources.  But if you pick the custom installation option when installing EasyShare from the CD, you can just install the downloader; when you plug the camera into the computer (USB), it then appears as a removable drive, just like most other digital cameras do.  You then move the picture files where you wish, and do with them as you like (Photoshop Elements, in my case).  Quite reasonable of Kodak to allow this.", "Date": "October 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Cool Little Camera", "Author": "R.

The camera was never a massive megapixel unit but to my surprise the photos came out clear and moderately sharp.In case the question of \"Didn't the ink dry up?\" strikes you, this system uses a multi-color film process layering what I believe to be the red, blue, yellow and black in four passes.

The only thing you can really custimize is the flash.The thing that dissapoints me the most is the absence of auto focus. This camera is a kids toy. If your an artist and are into details i wouldn't reccomend this. If you dont know alot about digital cameras or dont like to spend alot of time fooling around with features i would reccommend it, its really a no brainer or if your not good with electronics. Im exchanging it for a camera with auto focus, macro etc. Basically one with more advanced features and can be custimized more. I dont know why people are complaining about the battery in this camera its ok, i meen what do they expect, all digital cameras have short battery life. There is a lithium battery pack you can buy for it but its fairly expensive. I paid $150 CDA which is slightly overpiced.
