{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WOW what a great camera for this price, outstanding!", "Author": "Richard D. Cappetto \"RickDC\"", "ReviewID": "RE672BUQ19KOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So FAR I LOVE THE CAMERA, but I am not totally thrilled with the software. The software is good, but I like another program that I a have better (cannon photo shoot), and I transfer photos back and forth to that program.UPDATE: This Camera eat's ALKALINE Batteries for lunch, USE Ni-NH Recharagable Batteries for longer life and to save money. you can also use KODAK Lithium Digital Camera Battery CRV3. I am noticing people saying they are not getting good shots with thier camera, But I must say I am getting extreemly sharp shots.The Kodak Z1275 is a great little camera loaded with tones of user friendly features and has fantastic resolution at 12 megapixels. I have a 7.1 megapixels camera and was looking to upgrade a 10, Then I saw this 12 and at the same price my 7.1 coast a couple of years ago. I suggest 2 gig cards to hod more pictures when you shoot at high res and for video. With 12 MP your shots capture every detail, with outstanding resolution. This is easily as good as most 35 millimeter cameras if not better. You can do prints up to 30 X 40 and you can do quite small crops and get great resolution. I am having some minor problems with my memory cards, I have been getting a non format message on the camera a few times, which is not right, I did format the card. So what I do is shut the camera off, and remove the card and then reinstall it and that fixes the problem. Maybe it works better with Kodak cards, and I will get one and see for sure.The lens is a SCHNEIDER-KREUZNACH VARIOGON high quality lens with F Stop as fast as 2.8 to 5.1 when zooming. The Zoom is equivalent to a 35 to 175 mm on a  regular film camera. There is also a 5 X digital zoom and Digital image stabilization (The camera software automatically minimizes camera shake to deliver a clear picture); I still get great resolution zooming all the way out.The camera has  64 MB of internal memory, and has SDHC/SD/MMC card expansion slot that lets you keep shooting longer, I would suggest you get 2 or more 2 to 4 gig cards for vacations etc., When you insert a card it becomes the defult memory.The color display is a good size at 2.5 in. (6.4 cm) for such a small camera this camera is elph size (4 inches by 2 1/2 by 1 1/2 basically) and will fit in a shirt pocket. The Viewer is easy to see outside. If you shoot your pictures vertically or horizontally, you can view them right side up with an orientation sensor, which is automatic.You can do some editing right on the camera like cropping, histogram, digital red-eye reduction, and undo delete (also you can edit video as well).The Z1275 has a High ISO mode from 100 up to 3200, and with 3200 you can capture the details in low light situations without using the flash, such as concerts. I can't wait to test it out at a GFR show, I will report back after I do so.The Z 1275 automatically adjusts for all lighting situations such as tungsten nd florescent lighting and has 9 shooting modes it can automatically select (or you can manually select the mode you wish). Modes include; Portrait, landscape, Bright scene, Close-up, Action, Text/Documents, Manner/Museum (for places you cannot use flash) and Party mode ( for shooting people in low light situations) etc.,. the Macro is good but you can not get within 5 inches you need to stay back a bit. It also has 5 color modes, high Color, Low Color, B&W;, Natural Color and Sepia. these are all under one button on the dial they come up on the screen nd you scroll to the one you want, it's very easy to sue and even being a small camera, with my BIG HANDS, I find it no problem to operate.The Z 1275 has a Panorama stitch mode where you can combine up to three shots together into one large picture with panorama stitch mode. I am not great at this  LOL. But it is a fun feature. This gives you a more realistic panoramic.For Video you can Record HD video (1280 \u00d7 720) at 30 fps with sound, with MPEG 4 compression which uses less memory. I don't use a lot of video with my digital camera but its nice to have just incase, this looks very very good and you can Zoom in and out which you can't on most digital cameras.The Z1275 is a wonderful camera that is easy and fun to use, it is perfect for someone who just wants to set it on automatic and go; and is at a very low price, hear at amazon, it is a must have as a second camera for photo buff and as the only camera for someone whos wants a point and shoot only.", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Specs, but...", "Author": "A. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2XV2K71NOE6IF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let's start by saying mega-pixels don't mean everything! I bought this camera as a second to my fuji 6MP. From the first pictures through the 100th picture I noticed the same problems - high grain even with bright light, dull washed out photos with a flash, out of focus photos. I am quite knowledgeable with photography, so I do know how to take a picture, but just to make sure that it wasn't my imagination, I did an A-B comparison with my Fuji. I set both for the highest quality, and took the same photos with and without flash for each. The difference was like night and day as expected. The Kodak was not even close in quality. What was surprising was that when I blew up each picture to 8X10 size and printed, the Fuji was much clearer even though, due to the lower megapixel count, it was blown up more than the Kodak. Incidentally, I only used the optical zoom, I never use digital zoom.Also, this uses up batteries faster than any digital camera I have ever owned (this is my 6th). I have taken about 100 pictures with this camera, and have used 6 AA batteries already.To sum it up - the flash is too small, the lens is too small, the lens is not good enough quality, and the camera is a battery hog. It's going to be returned today...", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "A step backward for Kodak in quality and usability", "Author": "Brad Hutchinson", "ReviewID": "R23LLREVR0YHWN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Having previously owned all Kodak's (CX6330, CX7430, CX7530, & C875) I thought this camera would be an easy choice since I am familiar with how to use their cameras and from the specifications this appeared to be an improved version of the C875.  I also picked up a Panasonic TZ3K 7MP camera to see which of the two that I liked better since that was another camera I was interested in.  So, during this review I will compare the Z1275 with the Panasonic and the previous Kodak's that I have owned.  As a note about myself, the majority of pictures I take are of natural landscapes, lakes, reptiles, amphibians, and other wildlife.  Rarely do I take pictures of people and I've never used the video function on any digital camera that I've owned (that's what camcorders are for) so I will not be reviewing the video function because I never used it.  I also do no editing of images on the computer and expect a camera to take photos that look good without enhancements.  That being said, I will review some problems I had with this camera that I believe need to be addressed by Kodak in order to make better products.Shot to shot processing timeThis was the biggest problem with the Z1275 and the main reason that I ended up returning it and keeping the Panasonic.  Whenever you take more than 3 or 4 pictures in a row with this camera you get a message on screen that says \"processing\" with a little timer diagram which will go for about 5 seconds during which you can not take another picture.  When it finally stops and you take another shot you get the same message again.  If you want to wait till it actually stops processing you will have to wait 10+ seconds but will get the message after the next three shots once more anyways.  I have never experienced this with any of the previous Kodak's that I have owned except after using the burst mode feature.  While taking pictures with the Panasonic in my other hand at the same time using identical Sandisk Ultra II 2GB cards in each I could take about 12 pictures while the Kodak was barely getting 4 or 5.  If you plan to take pictures of wildlife or sports this will be a very frustrating problem since time does not stand still while you wait for the camera to process an image.Missing firmware/hardware problemsOver time I have found that Kodak has constantly removed things that I like from the camera's firmware for no apparent reason.  First off, on my old CX6330 there was an option to turn off the digital zoom but they have removed this option from all subsequent models from what I can tell.  As someone who has never and will never use the digital zoom since it results in very poor quality pictures I would like the option to turn it off.  Second, this camera does not have the AF assist lamp that my C875 had and I found to help out a lot in nighttime shots with a moving animal as it allowed me to take a picture while not actually looking at the screen and just paying attention to where the assist light was pointing.  Third is the problem that Kodak's images are definitely over compressed, the average file size I had for pictures was about 1.5MB in regular mode and less than 1MB in close up mode, which is equivalent to just about any other camera manufacturers 3 or 4 megapixel cameras.  I believe that this is what causes the shot to shot processing time to take so long since it must compress the image so much.  There is no reason for this given today's cheap memory card prices and the low cost of large hard drives to store images on.  Fourth, the main reason I was looking for a new camera is that my C875 would occasionally shut off while taking a picture and the photo you took would be corrupt and gone forever, unfortunately this also occurred once while using the Z1275 and I have read it in other reviews.  Lastly, another problem with my C875 was that every once in a while for no apparent reason it would give an error message that the memory card needs formatting and I would have to remove the card and put it back in and then it would work, this happened to me with the Z1275 also.  I have lost many shots of turtles and other things due to them submerging in the water while I fumbled around removing the memory card and replacing it and this is definitely a problem.  Before anyone says it, I have 6 different memory cards from different manufacturers and that is not the problem nor is it a problem with dead or the type of batteries I can say from trial and error.The flashThe flash on this camera is very weak and not placed in a good position.  You will have a hard time properly illuminating anything more than 5 or so feet away.  Also, I had the problem that sometimes it will not fire a full flash, it seems to throttle it down and will let out this half flash that you cannot make any brighter in the firmware.  In close up mode when using the flash I noticed that due to the design of the camera and the flash being over the lens you will have a shadow from the lens in every picture less than 3 feet away.  I never had this problem with the older CX models where the flash was off to the side of the lens and everything would be illuminated well even from just a few feet away.Image qualityI found that when comparing the image quality of the Z1275 to the Panasonic that in close up mode you can magnify the Kodak's images more on the computer without resulting in quality loss, but other than that the Panasonic was the clear winner even though it has 5 less megapixels.  When taking outdoor shots of a tree surrounded lake I found that the Z1275 would have very poor detail in trees seen in the distance where you could not tell one from the other and they would look extremely washed out.  Green trees in the distance would appear white and dead when they actually were not.  While taking pictures of a Bald Cypress tree with foliage in it's reddish/orange color phase the Kodak transferred that color to the entire picture including the trunk of the tree which was brown.  Also, I found that the camera would misrepresent colors and close up mode pictures seemed to have a bluish green tint to them.  In close up mode I took some excellent shots of a green treefrog but could not get the camera to focus on smaller things such as caterpillars no matter how hard I tried.  When taking pictures at full 5X zoom every single picture was blurry even when steadying myself against a tree or seated, essentially making the optical zoom selling point useless.  I never had this problem with the C875 and only rarely got a blurred image with that camera, so I don't know what Kodak changed with this one.No viewfinder/LCD screenI don't know why Kodak has decided to make cameras without a viewfinder and it is one of the main problems that I had with my C875 and the Panasonic also.  When given the choice I prefer using a viewfinder rather than and LCD screen especially when taking photos outdoors in bright lights or while wearing sunglasses when LCD screens are essentially useless.ConclusionI ended up returning this camera and keeping the Panasonic.  Kodak seems to be taking steps backward with each camera model and concentrating only on increasing megapixels for bragging rights while making poorer quality products.  I would not recommend this camera unless Kodak releases a firmware upgrade that speeds up the shot to shot processing time and fixes the unknown shutdown and memory card needs formatting error message issue.  I lost over 30 pictures while vacationing on an island this summer with my C875 due to the shutdowns and will never risk having a camera with that problem again.", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Overall, it is quite good", "Author": "Double T", "ReviewID": "R1VN62EN5SL7CN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this for two weeks.  Take casual photos under various conditions, indoor under low light conditions with high ISO and under fully auto, outdoor under full light condition, landscape and portrait etc.  Overall, all pictures came out to my satisfaction.  With high ISO, it is somewhat noisy and grainy but the image is still clear.  Reducing it to half size makes it quite acceptable.  The HD video is very sharp, but you may have to overlook the somewhat non-steady image screen.  Various comments I read offer different reasons, e.g. firmware design, but I think it is simply difficult to hold a small camera steady to shoot.  To review the pictures with 12MP resolution on the computer screen, some software seemed to give some jagged lines instead of smooth lines when the picture was shrunk to fit the screen.  Lines became straight when I zoomed it in.  That may explain some commenters were initially not happy with the quality before they use another software to review the pictures.  In summary, this camera offers some extra features and the quality of the pictures and videos is as good as can be expected for this price range.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "An Amazing Camera!", "Author": "M. VanVooren \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "RPAYHMV5RZ1RI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When our circa-2002 Pentax 4megapixel camera finally stopped working a couple months ago, I visited ConsumerReports.com and saw that they rank the C875 highly.  As I reviewed it on Kodak.com, I wasn't convinced it would let me take extended night/low-light photos.  I eventually came across the Z885, and was instantly impressed that this could and would do everything I wanted.  I then the Z1275, and knew it would be just what I needed: a would actually be better than the Z885, but I needed to confirm a couple of details first.I was impressed when I first read the specs on the Kodak.com page:[...][...]I bought one a few days later and am glad that the actual camera lives up to the specs.So, I share the following \"short list\" of Z1275 features that greatly impress me.-  Size - it fits in my pockets without being so thin you can't hold it (especially when the kids are jumping about), like too many current \"thin\" cameras; but thin enough to fit in pants pockets-  The finger grip on the front - great for holding when the kids are jumping about-  Hi-res 16x9 wide-angle video with accurate sound-  5x optical zoom-  Pre-defined Scenes (SCN setting) - all, especially:  - In-Camera panoramic stitching - AMAZING!  - Manner/Museum - no flash, all quiet  - Backlight  - Snow  - Beach-  P/M mode has given me wonderful night images with amazing color, detail, and strong depth of field; up to 8 second exposures are great for night/low light photos-  Image stabilization is great with the kids-  Long battery life, good enough for 200+ photos, many movies, watching many movies, many reviews, etc.  (I didn't follow this as closely as I should have, otherwise I would have more accurate results to share)-  Perfect Touch technology is simply amazing, taking good pictures and making them truly great!I also share a truly short list of the few things I thing could actually Improve the Z1275-  Manual controls in SCN/Panoramic stitch, for better low-ISO control of night/low-light panoramics-  Allow zooming (in and out and both) during exposures, for creativity-  Add a screen off button, for when you have the settings ready, just need to wait for the shot, and want to preserve the batteriesNow that I have seen the strengths of the Z1275, I truly think that Kodak is stuck in a place similar to GM: just because Toyota makes good/great cars doesn't mean that GM's aren't as good - they often rank better than Toyota; I now think the same is also true of Kodak.  It seems that enough negative press will cause a company decades of proving itself to overcome the negatives.  This Z1275 camera is another step in proving history is history, and that our future with Kodak is bright.  I think this camera lives up to the hype of  the \"Winds of Change\" YouTube video: [...]For batteries, I recommend Energizer 2500 mAh NiMH AA rechargeables and their compact charger.Mike VanVoorenSt. Louis, MO", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "There are much better digital cameras out there", "Author": "T. L. Smith", "ReviewID": "R2CUN1HN3SUI05", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had been camera searching for a while when my mom told me about this little Kodak.  The first digital camera I ever used was a Kodak and that camera was a champ.  It went to London with me, took great pictures for a 4MP, and lived for about 4 years.  My mom replaced it with another Kodak (C703) which was an AWESOME camera especially since it came with the dock included (a must have for all Kodak cameras in my opinion) for about $150 at Wal-Mart.  I was looking for something with a little better zoom and more features, which I thought I'd found in the Z1275.  I knew I was taking a risk since it was a brand new model and I couldn't read any consumer reviews or reports, but I'd always had good experiences with Kodak so I figured I was in good hands.My first move was to invest in the dock since it was not included.  This was another $50 purchase on top of the $250 I paid for the camera itself.  Basically the only reason I need the dock is to charge the camera (it comes with 2 regular AA batteries in the box) since I have a memory card reader in my laptop, but if you have a desktop the dock is by far the easiest way to put pics on your computer.  I'm not sure if you need to use the Kodak software with it or not (I've heard too many bad things about the easyshare software to actually put it on my PC), but once the dock is all hooked up, all you have to do to put your pics on your computer is push one button!  Each Kodak camera comes with its own dock adapter so don't throw it away thinking it's nothing!Unfortunately there are several reasons why I'm only giving this camera 3 stars and they are:1.  Inconsistent Picture Quality:  Every once in a while this camera will come out with a truly great pic, one I would EXPECT to come out of a 12 MP camera, but the rest of the time the pictures are grainy, blurry (sometimes worse than others), and just poor quality.  I've found that a lot of this depends on the flash and more importantly your subject.  If I'm taking a picture of an object within 20 feet of me, chances are the pic will turn out really good, even all the way zoomed in.  Taking pictures of people is a completely different story.  Sometimes they are good, lots of times they are not.  After going on vacation to visit friends, I was seriously dissappointed after putting pictures on my computer because so many of them were of such poor quality.  This leads me to my next point...2.  Poor Display Screen Quality:  Although the screen is nice and big to see your pictures, Kodak didn't seem to find it important to make the resolution very good.  After looking at other screens from different brands of digital cameras I was embarrassed by Kodak's lack of attention to this area.  For the most part, unless the picture is obviously horrible, it's impossible to tell how it truly came out until you put it on your computer.3.  Memory Card Capacity:  Considering that this is a BRAND NEW camera, and with the recent popularization of 4GB and even 8GB SD cards, I was disappointed to find out that the Z1275 will only hold up to a 2GB card.  I have not actually tried using a larger card, but my information came from a Kodak representative so I'd be really cautious before trying to use one.4.  The periodic error screen:  I'm not sure what this is all about, but other reviews have mentioned it.  I've only had it happen once or twice and thought it was something i did that was weird. Hearing that other people are having the same problem does concern me.  This problem has deleted one or two of my pictures; never the entire memory card, just the 1 or 2 most recent pics.Overall the most disappointing thing about the Z1275 is the picture quality.  To get a good picture I have to go through several different \"Scene\" modes and flash options, which is a pain if I'm trying to snap a picture quickly.  Also, a lot of it depends on your subject and the lighting.  I've tried going through all the scenes and megapixel options to find a good setting that takes good general pictures but I haven't found one yet.  Other people have tried to mess around with it and have had similar results to mine so I know it's not just me.  I've called Kodak with my concerns and they were very little help since they didn't even have the camera manual on file and the representative I talked to had never even heard of it.  I would have returned it except it had already passed the 30 day trial period.  In the end I'll probably end up keeping it and trying to work out some of the kinks.I would not recommend buying this camera since I know you can get a comparable, even better camera for $50-75 cheaper than the current asking price. If you are looking for a reliable digital camera the Kodak C703 is a great option.  I would gladly trade my Z1275 for one.", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome digital camera!", "Author": "A Bermudez \"Drdv\"", "ReviewID": "R22JUTA6Z7SN1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just want to say that if you are willing to buy a great camera at a reasonable price, don't hesitate to go for the kodak z1275, it's one of the newest kodak cameras and it has a lot of functions that you are going to love. it has 12 mega pixels which is like huge quality and huge prints as well, it also has 5x high quality zoom lens, in my oppinion, one of the best features of the camera along with its video recording and its automatic setting which allows you to automatically snap a picture with no worries about light condition etc. You can zoom in and out while recording a video which is a plus and its high quality everybody!!!!

If you are looking for an rewiew about all the good there are other reviews here that explain them better than I could. So on the the bad, The number one thing that i hated about this camera was the battery life. This camera really sucks up batteries like a mother! I put fresh batteries in and about 5-10 pictures later the batteries are dead. I had to carry packets of batteries just to take the pics that i wanted. Granted all the batteries I used were the ordinary energizer or duracel batteries and not the other more high tech battereies or rechargeable batteries but still i was disappionted with that fact. the second thing that i didn't like about this camera was that flash bulb is positioned were you have to be careful when holding the camera that you don't cover it up by mistake.

I carry it for those moments/times when a full size SLR or Video camera are very inconvenient or impossible. It fills that need very well.Pros: Compact, High(er) res, Easy to Use. Supports 16:9 HD video.Cons: Video has no image stabilization, Short battery life with standard batteries, lower quality lens and hence lower quality pictures. (compared with an SLR)Other comments and recommendations: Batteries: Get rechargeable NMh batteries. The Energizer AA NMh rechargeable batteries run for a full day of activities, pictures, video, etc. (about 2gb recording). The Kodak equivalent also seem to perform well.  I carry two spares at all times and never run into a problem having enough battery power for a full day.For those that complain about picture quality..  This is NOT an SLR. It is a compact camera and has a small lens. lens size usually has a direct impact on the amount of light hitting the sensor. Less light means poorer picture quality. Given the very small nature of this camera, I think it does a very good job. Outdoor, daylight pictures are fine.

Riemer \"Andrew James Riemer\"", "ReviewID": "R1W4YZL3F5COWC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Prior to today, I had a five-star review up for this camera.  I just deleted that review (all but the intro text is included below), however, because of a problem that popped up with this camera that we also had on another Kodak camera, I decided to pull my five-star recommendation and replace it with this one.  My apologies to anyone who made a purchasing decision based on my earlier review.A while back, we had another Kodak EasyShare camera with a retracting lens (like this model).  The lens got stuck in the open position at one point, so we sent the camera back in for repairs since it was under warranty.  A couple of years later, we bought this model.  Overall, I loved the features and the simplicity.  Unlike some other reviewers, I found this one easy to use--a real joy.  However, this summer, just a couple of months after the warranty expired, this camera began to have the same problem with its retractable lens assembly.  Because it was intermittant at first, we thought we were just using drained batteries (though the camera typically retracted the lens when the batteries died on prior occasions).  As it turns out, however, changing the batteries didn't help and the lens eventually went to its fully extended position and just stayed there. The camera is now useless--a complete brick.So, here I am, sitting with another Kodak camera with the same physical problem as a model we had two years earlier.  Is it a design flaw? I don't know.  All I do know is that I'm not going to buy another Kodak camera, since this appears to be something of a common problem.  My daughter, who also has a Kodak EasyShare camera with a retractable lens, has reported that hers is starting to give her trouble now, too.  While I was impressed with the camera's features and ease of use, I don't consider a digital camera to be a disposable item that I need to replace every year.  I almost picked up a second of this model that I found on clearance a few weeks ago, but didn't because I was short on cash.  Now, I'm really glad I didn't.Too bad, really.  It was a nice camera.  It had been my favorite to date.+++++ FROM THE ORIGINAL REVIEW +++++Here are the benefits, as I see them:- This camera has the shortest time between shots of any camera I've used in the sub-$500 range.  That means you'll snap more pictures, and miss less opportunities. [Note: while the camera is letting you review your photo, you can go back into picture-taking mode by partially depressing the shutter button (the one used to snap a photo)--that'll get you shooting again quickly.- The Smart Scene feature really does autodetect the best setting in most circumstances.  I no longer need to stop and change over to micro to shoot flowers, and then back to portrait to shoot people.  It simply works as advertised and MAKES THIS ONE OF THE EASIEST CAMERAS TO USE ON THE GO>- Even at 12 Megapixel resolution, a 1 Gb SD card [Note: Purchase one right away.] will store hundreds and hundreds of photos in JPG format.- Definately get a set of four NiHh rechargeable batteries (at least 2100 MAh rated).  You'll be able to shoot most of the day on one pair (assuming you're not using flash for all shots), and the second pair can always be charged and ready.- The LCD is a great size, and it surprisingly easy to read in sunlight. [Note: consider buying some plastic screen protectors to keep it safe from scratches.]- The menu system is easy to navigate and use.Overall, it's the best all-purpose digital camera I've owned.  I'm planning on getting another one for my wife, since she likes to use this one so much that I often need to \"steal\" it back from her.One last note: on cases.  Generally, I recommend purchasing the camera case *after* you have the camera in-hand.  If you purchase the case online, you risk that you might not like the way the camera fits in the case, or that the case is simply too large or too small.  Don't wait too long, however, because that case is the best protection your camera will have when you are on the go!", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Camera OK, customer service horrible", "Author": "mtrgrl", "ReviewID": "R1WULVF84NWDSO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not a bad camera overall, but God help you if anything goes wrong with it.

Although the camera performed OK for general picture-taking, I had 2 major issues:1.  The video quality was not good.  Of course, I did not expect the same quality as a dedicated video camera, but I have seen several examples from friends with similar cameras.  The video on this camera was very choppy, not matter what mode I used.  I used a high-speed SDHC 4MB card, with the same results.2.  We often use this camera to take pictures of our 3-year old grandson.  He rarely holds a pose for more than an instant, so I need the camera to take the picture when I press the shutter release.  This camera takes well over 1 second between shutter release and actually snapping the picture.  Most of the pictures of our grandson only show the back of his head!Some other issues with this camera:  a.  You cannot plug the camera into the USB port and access the pictures unless you download Kodak's clunky software.  Other cameras I have used are recognized by my computer as a new removable drive, making picture transfer a drag and drop operation.  b.  The automatic lens cover stuck open on several occasions.

Each has enjoyed a long life and has only been replaced when I wanted the features more modern models offered. From that first Kodak Instamatic that `Santa Claus' brought me one year, followed by a Kodak Advantix, then my first digital camera, the Kodak DC260. I finally upgraded my digital camera a few years ago to the Kodak Easyshare Z1275 12 MP Digital Camera with 5xOptical Zoom and have been extraordinarily pleased with it.The size of the Z1275 is much more compact that my previous camera yet has much more capability. At the time I bought it, it was one of the slimmer cameras available, although there are much slimmer today. I expect that when I finally replace it one day it will be to get an even smaller camera, but for now this is just perfect for me.This camera boasts an admirable 12MP resolution for photographs and the quality of the pictures I've taken with it definitely reflects that.With a 5x Optical Zoom, I can get close up with the subject or zoom out for a much wider shot. Zooming is quick and easy with a button that is placed in a position that is very convenient.The camera has 64 MB of internal memory, which will hold a bit, but also has a slot for an SD card. I put a 4 GB SD card in it and have never needed more space, although I've taken hundreds of photos at high resolution.Transferring photos from the camera to a computer is a snap. You can either attach the camera to your computer with the provided USB cable and use the Kodak software to transfer and manage the photos or you can simply remove the SD card and insert it in the SD card slot on your computer to copy or move the photographs.Rather than a traditional viewfinder, the Z1275 has a 2.5 inch color LCD screen on the back that works much better than the old-fashioned alternative. You can also review the photos after you've taken them using this screen and use the buttons on the camera to navigate through the photos and delete them if you wish.Underneath the camera is a port for a tripod and it works as well as any other tripod port.It takes two AA batteries. You can use regular AAs, but I highly recommend using either Lithium or rechargeable batteries with any digital camera.The camera does a great job taking pictures and automates many functions for you. When you are an amateur photographer like me, that's something you really appreciate. It automates the flash, reduces blur from camera shake or subject movement, automatically selects from ISO 100 to ISO 3200 based on lighting conditions, and smart scene mode automatically selects from nine available scene modes. A professional photographer will probably want a camera that lets them control these functions themselves, but someone like me prefers that the camera do the majority of the work for them. I don't want to spend a lot of time fiddling with the camera - I want to snap the picture fast so I can put the camera down and enjoy the moment with friends or family.Another feature I really like is the video mode. This camera can capture HD video (1280 \u00d7 720) at 30 fps with sound using MPEG-4 compression. My problem is I often forget it can record video and I don't use it. But the times I have remembered to use the video option it has turned out great.My old digital camera was good in its day, but it suffered some of the same pains that those older digital cameras did. My chief complaint with it was that you had hold the button down for a moment after you took a photo and if your subject moved, the picture turned out badly. Not so with the Z1275 - it takes the photo fast so that you get a great photo nearly every time without forcing your subject to freeze position for several seconds.The Kodak Easyshare Z1275 has been a really great camera for me and I expect it will last a number of more years. I had always thought that when I finally do replace it, it would be with another Kodak as I've enjoyed fantastic quality cameras with stellar technical support and customer support over the years. I was saddened when Kodak announced their bankruptcy this year and that they were going to get out of the camera business. I only hope that they reverse that decision before I finally need a new camera.", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Compact 12MP Champ", "Author": "Steve Bradford", "ReviewID": "R38HD5MM6WH2C3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is not a stereotypical, run-of-the-mill Kodak digital camera.Kodak's impressive Z1275 is a lightweight, portable, and packs a serious punch. Full of pro-am features, the Kodak Z1275 also includes an extremely sharp 5X 35-175mm Schneider-Kreutznach optical zoom lens. The lens in itself is worth the price of the camera, I feel: Extremely sharp in all corners with little noise.  What separates the Z1275 from the 12 Megapixel compact digital camera crowd is its ease-of-use.  Out of the box, this camera is very potent.The Z1275 is very easy to use.

You can go even further in selecting Program Mode or Manual Mode to shoot optimal aperture/shutter, or manually configure aperture/shutter speeds by yourself. Self timer, flash-type support, and configuration to lower Megapixels settings are easy to setup. 2.5 inch screen is bright and colorful. The camera uses 2 xAA batteries (Lithium suggested by author).These cameras are very durable. I have accidentally dropped mine several times without seriously damaging it. I suggest a small case to protect any camera you buy. Lens cloth and an occasional compressed air dusting will keep this camera going strong.The Kodak Z1275 uses SD-Flash Class 2 memory. I tried a C4 and C6 flash memory, but the camera didn't recognize it. So stick with Class 2 and you'll be fine.Kodak killed their digital camera business on 9 Feb 2012, but there are plenty of these amazing Z1275's available online.

This camera we received as a gift a year ago. We never checked the price until today and I am honestly shocked that it is priced at $200.  While a good deal for a 12MP 5x zoom camera, we were convinced it was a worthless piece of junk after having had constant issues with the batteries and processing times.  I was THIS close to taking a hammer to it.When we first received the camera, it worked fairly well (although I was never overly impressed with picture quality).  However about 6 months into it, we couldn't even take one picture because the batteries never lasted. I would put in brand new batteries (tried several brands, Alkaline, NiMH, rechargable - YOU NAME IT) and the camera would barely even turn on.  The light would be green initially, but would immediately turn to red and the camera would turn off.  It kills me that before I discovered this problem, I probably through away quite a few perfectly good batteries thinking that they were bad.What's interesting is that we finally put this camera to rest in our junk drawer.  It has sat there for two full months until today when I pulled it out as a last resort. And what do you know it turned on immediately and I have taken about 20 pictures in the past 3 days without battery failure.  I am still disappointed in processing time for deleting photos and taking new photos, but I am just shocked that it's turning on at all.The only conclusion I can come to is that there is some sort of internal battery/memory that just died on us and maybe it needed to be re-charged or rested.  Sounds crazy, but that's all I can figure out.I'm going to hold onto this until it dies again, but overall there's no way I would recommend this camera.

You can make large prints of even a small portion of a picture, and be confident of its fidelity and resolution.In researching the camera I was concerned about some negative comments by users, especially about battery life, but bought it anyway because of my excellent prior experience witht Kodak, and Consumer Reports Magazine's reviews of various Kodak models with similar battery usage characteristics.  (They didn't review this model, but did do a similar lower MP model).I just can't believe their experiences.  The camera comes with excellent non-rechargeable AA batteries.  They lasted well over 100 shots, most of which were energy hogging flash photos.I'm now using rechargeable Kodak batteries, and their life seems at least as long, and they cost under $15 at Wal-mart for 4 Rechargeable batteries + a recharger.ps.

Hardest thing i had was keeping the lens cleaned. Yes it eats battiers as do all of these high functioning camera's. Best thing is it will use any rechargable AA batteries. After 3 years my daughter dropped it on concrete and the battery door broke and won't close. I got the Z1485 and it pales in comparison to this beauty.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price <$200", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R37WHYDAAJRFFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Whoever has problem viewing the picture at major cropping, please use Microsoft's Picture Manager instead of Kodak software came with the camera.Only complain I have is the resolution of the LCD display. Other than that everything is great. Some seem to have problem with batteries life, took 140 pictures with one charge. The battery icon showed up after 100 picture. It seems to be OK.If the size and budget are the concerns, this is the camera for you.", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "good camera", "Author": "Ramazan May", "ReviewID": "R1YYFQ7R7L0TH1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so happy that I bought this camera.

Want to do business with the folks proceed with great caution.I do not blame them for anything I do not blame UPS fact is this community is infested with illegal aliens who love to rob steal and other wise take from those who have.
