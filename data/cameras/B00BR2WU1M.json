{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Getting to know the Nikon D7100", "Author": "Phyllis Carter", "ReviewID": "R1MRJLBE6MYWGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased the camera about a month ago and so far I love it. Used it professionally to do photo shoot of one-year old. Pictures required very little editing allowing me to spend my time creatively with the pictures. Camera's stabilizer worked well. Was also able to get good shots when the little one was on the move.  Close ups were really good.  Would recommend this camera to anyone who is interested in taking amateur photos to the next level.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,589.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D7100 Digital SLR Camera & 18-105mm VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) + <2> Nikon 55-200mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Samyang 500mm Telephoto Lens +\n<4> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card + <5> Spare EN-EL15 Battery + <6> Vivitar 67mm UV Glass Filter + <7> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter +\n<8> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <9> Rokinon 67\" Monopod & Case + <10> PD Laptop/Tablet DSLR Backpack + <11> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<12> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <13> T Mount for Nikon + <14> Instruction Sheet for T-Mount + <15> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D7100 Digital SLR Camera & 18-105mm VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) with 55-200mm VR Lens + 500mm Tele Lens + 32GB Card + Battery + Backpack + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517C4zFZsvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BR2WU1M"}}
