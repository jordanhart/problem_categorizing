I picked up an adapter so my Canon lenses fit on this body.  Pleased overall, would like to see how the stabilizer lenses work with the video mode, the kit lens shoots some rough \"action\" video.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dream Camera", "Author": "Judi B", "ReviewID": "R3T491YU5GN9M1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Panasonic Lumix G-2 is a dream! It is light and easy to handle - even with additional lens attached. The very \"skin\" on the camera makes it easy to grip. It takes incredibly clear and beautiful pictures which viewers credit to me, but it really belongs to the camera as I am still learning. I have been a camera buff as long as I can remember and have always wanted one of this caliber. I did a lot of research before I made my purchase and I do give myself a pat on the back for choosing the G-2. I can't wait to get out and take more and more photos.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "No English Manual", "Author": "?", "ReviewID": "R34EYZ0CU6WI4I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "No complaint on the camera itself but It bothers me that it came with three operating manuals and none of them are in English. Called the company and they said it was not a mistake and that the english version was on the CD.  The only CD I got was a editing tool and had nothing to do with the operating the Camera.  Happy that I know a little bit about cameras or this would be a real pain. I am not going to down load over 100 pages off a website just to get what should have came with the camera.I give it three stars not to knock the camera but to show how ticked I am over there not being a printed manual in English with the package and the company telling me there isn't one. Shame on them for knowing this and thinking it is okay to run their business this way.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite camera!", "Author": "R. Grokett \"bdfrogg\"", "ReviewID": "RW1RL8KHKGWO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had Nikon, Canon, and Pentax 35mm cameras. Then switched to those long zoom digital cameras, but found them too slow focus and shutter speed. I did like their smaller size over a DSLR, and when I found the 4/3rd's cameras, I immediately converted!  The Lumix has the professional feel and speed of a DSLR, but retains the smaller size to carry around. I did not want to lose the \"thru-the-lense\" eyepiece viewfinder, that many 4/3's cameras drop or require as extra, thus the Panasonic was exactly my fit.I've had mine for over a year now and gone on many world wide trips with it. If I had to replace it, I would instantly pick the Panasonic 4/3'rds DMC-G2 (or newer!)", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "My honest review", "Author": "Neon", "ReviewID": "R2AIPG2E75X8DP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this product from you about a year ago and it was as described  and came with in reasonable time expected .
