{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review Written for Beginner Photographers", "Author": "jpullos", "ReviewID": "R1C7IFG69T6MVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a photography teacher in NYC and online. (See my Amazon profile for my website.) I teach beginner and intermediate photography students every week. I've also been a professional photographer for the last five years with images published in The New York Times, GQ, New York Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, The New York Observer, The Village Voice and Time Out New York.(This review is for beginner photographers.)If you're a beginner, you're most likely asking yourself: Nikon or Canon? Really, I feel confident in saying that you can't go wrong with either. I've  used both brand's cameras extensively and find that they both offer amazing image quality with well-built, solid cameras that, if taken care of, will last decades. There are two differences between the cameras, though, that can be taken into consideration.The user-interface: If cameras were computers, Nikons would be PCs and Canons would be MACs. PCs are built for people not afraid of technology whereas Macs are built for people who want things super-easy. Nikons excel at customization options which means you'll see so many more options with the Advanced features of a Nikon than you will with a Canon. Canons, on the other hand, excel at ease-of-use for beginners. Canons offer less advanced options and can be easier to learn on. This can be frustrating down the line, though, once you've learned a lot about photography. At that point you may want all of the options that Nikon offers and be frustrated with your Canon. If you're someone who really likes to delve deep into your hobbies or if you're intent on becoming a professional photographer, I'd say a Nikon would be your best bet. If you're someone who wants to learn the basics of photography and only imagine yourself being a hobbyist, Canon would be a better option for you.Where Nikon excels: Flash photography. I often find myself in situations where I'm shooting event photography (weddings, movie premiers, benefits and galas) where I need to use a lot of flash. For this kind of photography, I'll always prefer to be shooting with a Nikon. Nikon's flash metering (how the camera magically decides how much light to fire out of the flash) is much more consistent than Canon's. You can take a Canon and shoot the same scene three times in a row with flash and all three images will be at different brightness levels. You can do the same thing with a Nikon and all three images will be wonderfully the same. If you're somebody who plans on shooting a lot with flash (indoor photography, event photography, etc.) you'll want to consider going with Nikon.Where Canon excels: Richness of colors. I've been in numerous situations where I've been on the red carpet taking the exact same picture as the photographer next to me. I'll have a Canon and the person next to me will have a Nikon. This has provided quite a few opportunities to compare the images side-by-side. What I've found is that the colors on the Canon's images look richer and make the image pop more. If I'm doing fine art photography (anything I'd like to someday hang in a gallery), I'll always want to be shooting with a Canon for this reason.If you're set on Nikon, there are three cameras you should be considering and it all comes down to what your budget is:D7000 $1,400 without lensD5100 $750 without lensD3100 $600 only available with lens(current prices as of 2/19/11)Here's what you get for spending extra money (each camera compared to the one below it):D3100 vs. D5100:The D3100 is an EXCELLENT camera so if you only have $550 to spend total on camera and lens then go out and buy this camera. You won't regret it. If you're considering spending more money, here's what you'll get from the D5100 in comparison:-Better performance in low light situations.-A higher resolution screen on the back of the camera so you can see your images more clearly and make out if they actually turned out well.-An external mic jack. (If you're planning on shooting video with an external mic, you'll want the D5100 over the D3100.)-A flip out screen (handy if you want to put your camera anywhere but at your eye level and be able to see what your camera is about to capture before you shoot it)-Faster continuous shooting. If you're often shooting sports or any fast moving subject, continuous shooting allows you to capture multiple images in a single second. The D3100 shoots at three frames per second whereas the D5100 shoots at four frames per second.-Higher ISO options. The D5100 offers one more stop of ISO than the D3100 does. If you don't know what ISO means (or what a stop is) just know that this allows you to more easily shoot images in low-light situations.-Longer battery life. The D5100's battery will last 20% longer than the D3100The two advantages of the D3100 over the D5100 are: less expensive and less weight. Whenever a camera is less expensive, it means you'll have more in your budget for the lens. The D3100 weighs 10% lighter and is 10% smaller than the D5100.D5100 vs. D7000:The D5100 is Nikon's latest and greatest and is even newer than the D7000. Phenomenal camera! If you're stuck, though, between the D5100 and the D7000, here's what you'll get by spending more money on the D7000:-More focus points. When using auto-focus, the D7000 will have an easier time focusing on what you want it to focus on.-60% longer lasting batteries.-Faster continuous shooting. If you're often shooting sports or any fast moving subject, continuous shooting allows you to capture multiple images in a single second. The D5100 shoots at four frames per second whereas the D7000 shoots at six frames per second.-Weather sealed. This means you can shoot with the D7000 in the rain.-Two memory card slots. This is really a cool feature. The D7000 has two memory card slots which means you'll be less likely to find yourself standing in front of a gorgeous scene with no more memory left.-Faster shutter speed. The fastest shutter speed on the D5100 is 1/4000th of a second; on the D7000: 1/8000th of a second. To be honest, I can't think of any practical reason why this would benefit you unless you're planning on shooting some really bright scenes like directly into the sun.Advantages of the D5100 over the D7000:-A flip out screen (handy if you want to put your camera anywhere but at your eye level and be able to see what your camera is about to capture before you shoot it)-Smaller and lighter: The D5100 is 10% smaller and 30% lighter than the D7000. This is something to consider if you plan on carrying your camera around with you a lot.-Less expensive so you can spend more on your lens!If I can clarify any of this, please email me!-JP Pullos, photography teacher, NYC and online (see my Amazon profile for my website)", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera -- A perspective from a D300/700 Owner", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "RKM91CMQJYE4S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is very simple, if you are a Nikon shooter looking for a new camera then stop reading and buy this camera. It's that good.HandlingThis camera is brilliant to hold and use. Nikon has done it again and has made the user interface more usable and streamlined. What to change flash modes. Press the flash pop-up button and rotate the control wheel. Sweet. Want to change create and use a User defined mode? There are two. Set your mode up. Go to the menu and save it. To use it rotate the shooting mode dial to U1 or U2. Presto you are there. In the D300 and D700 you to have to setup things in the menu and switch in the menu. Also, there were 2 sets of things you could change and they were not all inclusive. It was all horribly confusing and I never used it. Speaking of shooting modes. There is now one position on the shooting mode dial for scene mode shooting. You change through the different scene modes with the control wheel and the type scene shows up on the back screen. Sweet. I can go on and on but needless to say Nikon have really improved their interface. One caveat, I don't think it is quite up to par with the GH1 to change exposure compensation (IMO the most important control) but still a huge step in the correct direction in handling. I like the handling of the  D7000 better than either the D700/300.Low Light ShootingThe D300 wasn't that great for Hi ISO. It shoots clean at 400 ISO and usable up to 1600. (The D90 and D300s were better) The D700 was fantastic. Clean at 1600 ISO and usable up to 6400. It opened up new worlds. The D7000 is close to the equal of the D700. Enough said. Just to give you an example. The bouquet toss at a reception is often done in poor light. By using 1600 instead of 400 you get the equivalent of 4 times more light. At ISO400 you flash may need to use 1/4 power and you can get 1 maybe 2 shots of the toss and catch before the flash needs to recharge. At ISO1600 your flash would only need to use 1/16th power and now you can get 5-6 shots. This is huge.Picture QualityLike all modern DSLRs it takes great pictures. I don't pixel peep so I can't really say that I notice a difference between the pictures from the D7000 and any of my 12mp cameras. It makes really nice pictures and that is all I care about.Useful Photography Features (Not Marketing Features)--100% view finder! Big bright with 100% coverage. No more guessing of your framing. (It is not as bright as the D700. However, it is 100% vice 95%)--2 SD slots - When your getting paid to shoot a wedding or any gig, my card broke is not an excuse. Very useful feature. For the home user put two smaller cards rather than one big card and save some money.--Smaller and lighter than D300, D700, D3s, D3x- When you stand on your feet for 9 hours shooting the wedding and reception, you start to feel every ounce you are carrying. Often you will be carrying two bodies with a fast tele zoom and fast wide zoom. That starts to get heavy. Light weight here we come.--2016-Segment RGB Meter- for spot on exposure and white balance--No one touches Nikon on this and this one is fantastic.--1/8000th -- Very useful for shooting into the sun wide open with a bright lens--1/250 -- Could be better (1/500th for D40) but could be much worse. Auto FP helps.--Magnesium body and better sealing -- Shoot in dusty environments without messing up the inside your camera.--Uses the ML-L3 infra red remote -- Small and cheap. IR sensor on the front and back of the camera.--Autofocus focus motor for non-AF-S lensesMarketing Features that will sometimes be Useful--16Mp -- Nikon was obviously getting creamed in the marketing wars on this. This is going to lead to bigger files requiring larger hard drives and faster computers. Occasionally it will be useful if you can't frame as close as you would like and you need to crop or you need to print big. Alien Skin Blow Up 2, Image Resizing Plug-in Software for Photoshop, Macintosh & Windows and Genuine Fractals 6 Professional Edition 1-user Full are two very nice programs that can increase the size of your photos for printing large. 16 MP is nice by not necessary.--39 Point Auto Focus -- To me in some ways this is better than the 51 point of the D300 and D700 as that gets too unwieldy. However, you really don't even need 39. However, still useful on occasion.--6 frames per second-- I very rarely ever put my camera in 3 frames per second. When I do so it fills the card quickly. If you are shooting the big game then 6 is nice. Or it is nice for some cool special effects shots. Other than that you won't really find yourself using it that much.VideoThe other thing I am not really going to dwell on is the video capabilities. In my opinion all the various video options are mostly marketing hype really targeted at a niche market. Shallow depth of field video is difficult and time consuming to shoot and edit properly. The average family home user has neither the time nor inclination to do this. With that said, it is nice to only have to carry one device to take still pictures and video. So I do enjoy that feature, however 1080 is not really necessary. In fact with up converting DVD players standard def is still very usable and takes up far less space. Suffice it to say that the video capabilities are very good and should do anything a home user would need it to do. Can be used for pro Videos as demonstrated by Chase Jarvis.IntangiblesThis is a very nice camera and it feels very solid in your hands. It feels far more substantial than the D40/D90 without feeling like a brick the way the D300/D700 do. I am sure the D300 has more marketing features than the D7000 but I would have to research them to figure out what they are.ConclusionIn the end it all comes down to what is important to you. Smaller weight and size is becoming much more important to me and this camera is a very good trade off of features for size and weight. Anything that is missing I don't even use so I am not sure what it may be. My D700 was recently stolen and while I miss it, the D7000 is a worthy replacement for it. I opted to get the D7000 and Panasonic GH2 and save the $300 difference for a lens.Pros--100% view finder!--6 fps (7D is 8. However, I think this number is overhyped in most cases. Even shooting at 3 FPS will fill up you card with photos that look remarkably similar) 8+ is needed for professionals shooting professional sports. Not enthusiast shooting High School etc.--16mp sensor (a marketing increase but still nice to allow some room for cropping)--14 bit photos--39 point auto focus sensors (19 cross point) this is a bit of a marketing thing but it is still nice and it does not matter about the 51 on D300s and above. Still very nice.--2016 scene meter - compares against data base for WB setting and color settings--Excellent battery life--MD-11 Optional Battery Grip--2 SD card slots for back up redundancy or double the card space! Outstanding--Magnesium used to make camera strongerCons--16mp senor (takes up more storage on your hard drive) (12mp JPG 3mb 12 mp RAW = 12 mb 16mp JPEG = 5 mb 16 mp RAW = 16 mb. This is for 12 bit. 14 bit would require more)--Camera heavier than it used to be--No swivel screen - after using the GH1 extensively you really miss this when shooting at weird angles. You especially miss it for macro photography.--No full time live view - Ditto from above. Live view is what you see is what you get. Forgot to change white balance-- you will see that when people are yellow, blue or green. Have it set in manual and blowing everything out-- you'll see that as a white screen.Decision MatrixNikonFor the Nikon shooter this is a no brainer. If you are in the market for a camera, then skip the D300s. The D700 is getting long in the tooth and many people are buying the D7000 while waiting for D800. If you already own a D700 then this camera is a very good complement to it. Use the money you saved over the more expensive camera to buy a nice lens.Here is a breakdown vs other Nikon DSLRsD3100-- Two completely different classes with the D7000 being worth the difference in many. However at the end of the day they will both make nice pictures. Also, the lenses are more important than the camera. You can get the D3100 and 18-200mm for the same price. Something to think about.D5000-- Good sensor and nice camera. D3100 comments also apply here.D90--Tough choice. The best DX sensor of its generation and still better than most. If you can't quite stretch to the D7000, this is a very tempting proposition.D300S-- Irrelevant.  The D7000 has a much better sensor, is smaller, lighter, cheaper, and better metering.Nikon D700-- Would be a good complement to the D7000. Use D7000 when you need the 1.5x crop on the long end and a deeper depth of field due to the smaller chip (about 1 stop deeper) and D700 for when you want to isolate a subject with a shallow depth of field or you want to use the full width of a wide angle such as the 14-24mm. If you don't need the shallower depth of field of a FX sensor and you have the lenses to cover the 1.5x crop then the D7000 should suit just fine. D3s and D3x -- Different leagues altogether. However, the D7000 is 90% of the camera for 1/4 to 1/6th the money.CanonThe 7D is an outstanding camera and while I think the D7000 is a better camera (better sensor, 2 SD card slots, 2016 RGB metering, Price) it is not that much better to warrant switching if you are already invested in lenses.SonyThe Sony SLT-A55 is a great camera but not in the league of the D7000. However it is $350 less and does have so unique properties.  It is rumored to have the same sensor as the D7000 but Nikon always does their magic and makes it better (D3x vs A900).  The translucent mirror allows for fast shooting but loses 1/3 a stop of light.  Still a very nice camera.Non-DSLR Owner or DSLR owner with just the Kit LensWhen you are buying a DSLR, you are really buying into the lens system.  So factor that into you decision making matrix.  For that reason, if you have not spent a fortune on lenses yet then I recommend the m4/3 as in my opinion that is the future.  The sensor of the top m4/3(GH2) is every bit as good if not better than the current crop of DX sensors and almost as good as the D7000.  It is getting to the point, the sensor doesn't matter as much.  At this point handling, size and weight start to become more important.With this in mind I would recommend the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black) to anyone not invested in a lens system. It is smaller, lighter, more capable on the video side and in many ways better on the stills side. It needs a faster flash sync speed, faster shutter speed and the construction is not up to Nikon or Canon standards (In all fairness this cuts down on weight and I have not had a failure with my GH1.)  It is probably not quite as good at the high ISO. On the positive side it has a multi-aspect sensor as it is actually an 18mp sensor (16:9, 2:3, and 4:3 will all be 16mp not crops of one aspect ratio) It sells for $899 body only, $999 with the 14-42mm and $1499 with the fantastic 14-140mm 10x zoom. The lack of a mirror flipping up is a benefit in all cases. Also, you can use just about any lens ever made on this camera. Nikon, Leica, Canon, Pentax, C Lenses. You lose auto focus on any auto focus lenses and there is no accurate way to adjust your aperture on G series lenses.  While the GH1 sensor was by far the best M4/3 sensor and equaled most DX sensors of its generation, it did not quite stand up to the D90 sensor. I expect the D7000 to have a higher Dynamic Range and be an overall better sensor. However, that difference will not be noticeable to the lay users. What you get is a noticeably smaller and lighter camera that out handles any DSLR on the market and has the best video capabilities. In my opinion the GH2 will be the best all-around camera of its generation. The GH1 is the camera I reach for 90% of the time when I shoot for pleasure. When Panasonic puts out a full Pro line of lenses, I will use it more in the Pro situations. I am sure the GH2 will be my new go to camera.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "D7000 vs. the D90", "Author": "R. Willard", "ReviewID": "R1OX8M0TJG2OTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hundreds of general reviews of the D7000 have already been written, so instead of trying to reinvent that wheel I will address specific issues that people who are thinking of upgrading may find helpful. If you currently own a D80 the upgrade is a no-brainer. Just do it, you won't regret it. If you're using a D90, as I was before, you may be considering the upgrade to a D7000 a bit more skeptically.I am a serious amateur/hobbyist with more than 50 years of experience in photography, and have progressed from a D50 to a D80 to a D90 (each owned for two years), to the D7000 purchased two months ago.Initially I wondered if the upgrade from a D90 would really be worth it. Well, it definitely is. The D7000 isn't an upgrade to the D90 in the traditional sense that we tend to think of upgrades, it's a whole NEW CAMERA. The improvements I'm most impressed with that matter most to me personally for my kind of photography?1. New sensor with greater dynamic range and superior high-ISO performance. The first DX body to come close to approximating FX cameras in these areas.2. New 39-point AF module that puts the D80 and D90's 11-point AF to shame in AF-C and makes easy work of any kind of action photography. Not only faster and more precise autofocusing, but also a significantly improved method for quickly choosing different AF modes.3. Improved layout of buttons and controls on the body, but with a nearly identical menu structure to the D90 that makes it easy to learn and implement everything, including the D7000's new features. The learning curve should be minimal coming from a D80 or D90. And there are enough similarities to the D300 to make it an easy transition.4. Metering, especially matrix metering, is more accurate in a wider variety of lighting conditions -- definitely improved over the D90 and a major improvement over the D80. A camera's meter readings are always suggestions, not commandments, and EV compensation is often necessary. But the D7000's matrix metering gets the exposure very close to right the vast majority of the time.5. The D7000's light touch (hair trigger) shutter release takes a little getting used to, but it definitely minimizes the chance of camera motion blur when taking a picture. I understand that D300 and D700 users won't notice much difference in the touch, but it's a major improvement if you're coming from any of Nikon's consumer DSLRs.6. The 6 fps continuous mode is plenty fast enough to capture very fast action like birds in flight. And the new dial configuration makes it easier than ever to change shooting modes quickly.7. Programmable U1 and U2 modes eliminate time-consuming menu diving and button pushing when you want to switch instantaneously between settings for different situations (landscape or scenic shots vs. action photography, for example).8. The introduction of several \"pro body features\" in a consumer camera like AF fine tuning, which is not something you need all the time or want to use indiscriminately, but it's wonderful to have when you need it.9. Better construction gives the D7000 a \"pro feel\" not present in other consumer grade Nikon bodies. A subjective opinion, I know, but just picking up a D7000 tells you that you're handling a very solid, serious piece of equipment.10. Yes, we all bemoaned the introduction of a new D7000 battery. But this new EN-EL15 is a powerhouse that will give the Energizer Bunny a run for his money. A very positive new enhancement.11. Last but not least (lest we forget the real purpose of a camera), I am taking better pictures (technically, at least) with my D7000 than I did with my D90 -- and doing so much more easily and efficiently. Compared to the 2-3 months it took me to adapt to the D80 and D90 when I upgraded to those bodies before I began getting really satisfactory results, there hasn't been any such prolonged learning curve with my D7000.I have not commented on the D7000's video capabilities because I don't shoot video with it. I have noted that autofocusing with any lens in Live View is rather slow, even in good light, and many lenses may have difficulty achieving an accurate focus lock in low light. And a few lenses may fail to autofocus in Live View at all. This is not really important to me because I very rarely use this feature, but it is something to be aware of.A word about lenses: Achieving the best results with the higher resolution of the 16MP D7000 does require good lenses. The 18-105 VR kit lens is adequate and will yield perfectly satisfactory results. However, obtaining the superior image quality that the camera is capable of calls for better quality glass. For an excellent general purpose \"walkaround\" lens that is also a Best Buy at $449, I personally recommend the Sigma 17-70mm f/2.8-4 DC Macro OS HSM Lens for Nikon Mount Digital SLR Cameras. I prefer this Sigma to the somewhat overpriced Nikon 16-85 VR. To cover the telephoto range, I would suggest adding the excellent Nikon 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED IF AF-S VR Nikkor Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras to your arsenal.I hope Amazon shoppers for the D7000 body only who thinking of upgrading from a previous DSLR find my observations helpful.UPDATE ON 03/16/11 --Here is a link to my Flickr photostream if you would like view some of the photos I have taken with the D7000. They include the EXIF info and were taken with the Sigma 17-70mm f/2.8-4 DC Macro OS HSM and Nikon 70-300 VR.[...]One feature I didn't mention in my original review is in-camera editing. This is not something new, but it's much more robust in the D7000 and I use it quite a bit. For example, JPEG shooters will appreciate the in-camera WB adjustment that lets you correct color balance that's way off right in the camera and then make subtle adjustments in post processing. Likewise, in-camera B&W; and sepia conversions produce images with a full tonal gradient for later creative manipulation on the computer. Both of these are handy time-savers, and your original image always remains intact. The in-camera cropping options have also been expanded to include virtually all of the popular formats and provide excellent flexibility for basic cropping.The more I use my D7000, the more I appreciate what a significant upgrade it is to the D90.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cool things you might not know the D7000 can do", "Author": "James Sabo", "ReviewID": "R2GH8CMZKMLBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just take it for granted that this takes amazing pictures under all conditions, including low light, and that it contains all the manual controls that you'd ever want.Instead, here's some things that the camera does that you might not have heard about:* Built-in EyeFi supportIf you've used EyeFi SD cards before, you probably assumed that it would work with the D7000, since the D7000 now uses SD cards instead of CF. But not only do you not have to mess around with SD-to-CF adapters, the camera is actually EyeFi aware-- you can choose to have it upload or not upload on a slot-by-slot basis (so you might have it automatically upload the RAW files you saved to an EyeFi Pro card in slot 1, but not bother to upload the JPEGs you saved to the EyeFi Explorer card in slot 2), and there is also an icon that appears on the Info display to indicate that there are files waiting to upload, that the upload is in progress or disabled, etc.The Nikon Wifi adapter is going for $400. A 4GB, class 6 EyeFi card goes for $40. If you really want to move RAW files, snag the Pro version for $80. Yes, the Nikon adapter does things that EyeFi can't, but if you just want to get your files onto a PC without pulling the card, why spend 10X the money?You're stuck with the usual limitations of the EyeFi card, but I fully expect to use this feature a LOT with studio portraits-- yeah, it only takes 10 seconds to pull the card and have Windows recognize that you added it, then another 5 seconds to eject the card and stick it back in the camera. But if you just want a quick check that your exposure or focus is where you want it, wouldn't you rather just hit a single key and see your last shot, then get right back into the flow? You may want to drop your JPEG file sizes to speed up the transfer.* In-camera RAW file processingThe camera contains a ton of built-in settings-- in addition to the basics like Standard, Normal, Landscape, etc, you also get all the various Scene modes, which are basically variations on those main settings.RAW processing allows you to see how the shot would have looked had you used one of those other modes. In other words, you shoot in Normal, which basically applies no processing to the image, then select the RAW file, and choose how you'd like to adjust it. You can change the white balance settings, exposure, basic picture setting (landscape, portrait, etc), noise reduction, color space, and dynamic lighting. With the exception of the advanced details on the basic picture settings, you see a preview of how your change will affect the picture.If you like it, just hit EXEcute and it writes out a JPEG to your card. Don't like it, just back out and nothing's saved.This means that you don't have to worry that shooting in Vivid is going to result in an oversaturated image, or you can punch something up even more after the fact. The only real drawback here to me is that it is going to kick out a JPEG, so if you're planning on doing further editing in Photoshop, this may not be the best route. But if you're just looking to go right from the camera to the web, or want to get an idea of how playing with custom settings will affect your shots, this is a massive shortcut to taking and then deleting a ton of shots. (And keep in mind that Photoshop will allow you to mess with most of these settings when importing RAW files anyway, and the plugin D7000-compatible RAW plugin had a release candidate posted yesterday, so you can finally open your RAW shots.)And a related feature that's in most other Nikons, but that you might not know about-- you can define your own basic picture settings. Want something that's super-saturated and super-contrasty? Just hit a few buttons, choose a name, and you're done. On the older Nikons, you had to edit the basic profile itself, now, you can use one as a starting point and adjust from there. Much cleaner.* User-defined settings on the control knobNot as hidden as the first two, but I can't emphasize how cool this feature is. Here's the situation I was in last night-- I was shooting a singing contest in a dimly-lit venue. I was allowed to use a flash, but I didn't want to constantly be blasting the singers while they were performing.I defined one setting as shutter priority, 1/60th, ISO Hi 2, center-weighted metering & focus, no flash. The second setting was automatic, ISO auto, full metering and autofocus, flash enabled. I'd take a couple shots in U2 with the flash, close the flash down and switch to U1 and shoot a half a dozen shots, then switch back to U2 and use the flash for a couple more shots. There was no fumbling for controls, no worrying that I changed the shutter speed without realizing it when changing between Auto and S-- every time I went from U2 to U1, all my settings were reset to where I put them before the event started.I don't think I ever felt as confident about my camera settings in a rapidly changing situation as I did last night-- with just a simple twist of a knob, I was able to change to a completely different shooting configuration with absolute confidence that it was what I wanted.To me, the utility of this is almost endless-- I'll probably set up one setting for studio portraits, and the other for landscape stuff. If I was still shooting news, I'd probably be swapping between flash and no-flash configurations. For sports, I'd change between action modes and post-game portraits.The only thing that would make this even better would be if I could import and export settings for later use-- even if you use the \"Save/Load\" settings option to back up your current configuration to a memory card, it doesn't appear that this information is stored. However, it may be a bug in the Load settings feature, as a number of my settings were incorrectly reset when I tried to load in settings. Either way, it would work better if I could treat these like custom basic picture settings, saving them by name and loading them at will.* Built-in interval timer shootingWant to take time-lapse pictures? Just set up your camera on the tripod, specify when you want it to start, how many pictures to take overall, and how many pictures to take each interval and walk away. When it's time to start taking pictures, the camera will automatically focus and shoot, then go back to waiting for the next shot. No messing around with tethering, 3rd party software, whatever-- it's all in the camera, and it's all super-easy to set up. You'll find yourself taking pictures of your living room just to see what your cat actually does all day while you're at work.* Zoom in live viewThis might just be \"new to me,\" but I found it to be very cool for manually adjusting focus when on a tripod-- frame your basic shot, then change to live view. From there, zoom in with the magnifying glass key, and move around the image with the navigation pad until you find the point you want to focus on, then manually focus. Since you can zoom into a tiny portion of the overall image, you can see that you're getting exactly the focus point you want before you take the shot. One gotcha that I always forget, though-- don't forget to pick your aperture BEFORE going into live view, as you can't change it once live view has started.* Adjustable shooting rateAgain, might be \"new to me,\" but in addition to blasting away at 6fps, you can manually adjust that from 1 to 5 FPS in order to get a different effect. You obviously need to be using a fast enough shutter speed to support your choice-- if you're at 1/2 a second, you're not going to shoot faster than 2FPS.As I mentioned in one of my other reviews, I used to be a semi-pro photographer-- I was the photo editor for both a weekly and a daily paper, I've shot tons of sports and news photos, and landscape photography is my hobby. I've recently gotten back into portrait photography as well. While I never owned as many cameras as a true pro would have (that semi- means that I never made enough money at it to be able to really spring for equipment), I have shot with a lot of other people's equipment, and I can honestly say that this is the best camera I've ever used.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera -- A perspective from a D300/700 Owner", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R1G8NRY4ZLSWKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is very simple, if you are a Nikon shooter looking for a new camera then stop reading and buy this camera. It's that good.HandlingThis camera is brilliant to hold and use. Nikon has done it again and has made the user interface more usable and streamlined. What to change flash modes. Press the flash pop-up button and rotate the control wheel. Sweet. Want to change create and use a User defined mode? There are two. Set your mode up. Go to the menu and save it. To use it rotate the shooting mode dial to U1 or U2. Presto you are there. In the D300 and D700 you to have to setup things in the menu and switch in the menu. Also, there were 2 sets of things you could change and they were not all inclusive. It was all horribly confusing and I never used it. Speaking of shooting modes. There is now one position on the shooting mode dial for scene mode shooting. You change through the different scene modes with the control wheel and the type scene shows up on the back screen. Sweet. I can go on and on but needless to say Nikon have really improved their interface. One caveat, I don't think it is quite up to par with the GH1 to change exposure compensation (IMO the most important control) but still a huge step in the correct direction in handling. I like the handling of the  D7000 better than either the D700/300.Low Light ShootingThe D300 wasn't that great for Hi ISO. It shoots clean at 400 ISO and usable up to 1600. (The D90 and D300s were better) The D700 was fantastic. Clean at 1600 ISO and usable up to 6400. It opened up new worlds. The D7000 is close to the equal of the D700. Enough said. Just to give you an example. The bouquet toss at a reception is often done in poor light. By using 1600 instead of 400 you get the equivalent of 4 times more light. At ISO400 you flash may need to use 1/4 power and you can get 1 maybe 2 shots of the toss and catch before the flash needs to recharge. At ISO1600 your flash would only need to use 1/16th power and now you can get 5-6 shots. This is huge.Picture QualityLike all modern DSLRs it takes great pictures. I don't pixel peep so I can't really say that I notice a difference between the pictures from the D7000 and any of my 12mp cameras. It makes really nice pictures and that is all I care about.Useful Photography Features (Not Marketing Features)--100% view finder! Big bright with 100% coverage. No more guessing of your framing. (It is not as bright as the D700. However, it is 100% vice 95%)--2 SD slots - When your getting paid to shoot a wedding or any gig, my card broke is not an excuse. Very useful feature. For the home user put two smaller cards rather than one big card and save some money.--Smaller and lighter than D300, D700, D3s, D3x- When you stand on your feet for 9 hours shooting the wedding and reception, you start to feel every ounce you are carrying. Often you will be carrying two bodies with a fast tele zoom and fast wide zoom. That starts to get heavy. Light weight here we come.--2016-Segment RGB Meter- for spot on exposure and white balance--No one touches Nikon on this and this one is fantastic.--1/8000th -- Very useful for shooting into the sun wide open with a bright lens--1/250 -- Could be better (1/500th for D40) but could be much worse. Auto FP helps.--Magnesium body and better sealing -- Shoot in dusty environments without messing up the inside your camera.--Uses the ML-L3 infra red remote -- Small and cheap. IR sensor on the front and back of the camera.--Autofocus focus motor for non-AF-S lensesMarketing Features that will sometimes be Useful--16Mp -- Nikon was obviously getting creamed in the marketing wars on this. This is going to lead to bigger files requiring larger hard drives and faster computers. Occasionally it will be useful if you can't frame as close as you would like and you need to crop or you need to print big. Alien Skin Blow Up 2, Image Resizing Plug-in Software for Photoshop, Macintosh & Windows and Genuine Fractals 6 Professional Edition 1-user Full are two very nice programs that can increase the size of your photos for printing large. 16 MP is nice by not necessary.--39 Point Auto Focus -- To me in some ways this is better than the 51 point of the D300 and D700 as that gets too unwieldy. However, you really don't even need 39. However, still useful on occasion.--6 frames per second-- I very rarely ever put my camera in 3 frames per second. When I do so it fills the card quickly. If you are shooting the big game then 6 is nice. Or it is nice for some cool special effects shots. Other than that you won't really find yourself using it that much.VideoThe other thing I am not really going to dwell on is the video capabilities. In my opinion all the various video options are mostly marketing hype really targeted at a niche market. Shallow depth of field video is difficult and time consuming to shoot and edit properly. The average family home user has neither the time nor inclination to do this. With that said, it is nice to only have to carry one device to take still pictures and video. So I do enjoy that feature, however 1080 is not really necessary. In fact with up converting DVD players standard def is still very usable and takes up far less space. Suffice it to say that the video capabilities are very good and should do anything a home user would need it to do. Can be used for pro Videos as demonstrated by Chase Jarvis.IntangiblesThis is a very nice camera and it feels very solid in your hands. It feels far more substantial than the D40/D90 without feeling like a brick the way the D300/D700 do. I am sure the D300 has more marketing features than the D7000 but I would have to research them to figure out what they are. As for the lens, I am not really that hot on this lens.  It will do fine but the Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S ED VR II Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon DX-Format Digital SLR Cameras is far more useful.  Also, you can buy the Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens and Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR [Vibration Reduction] Zoom Nikkor Lens for about the same price as the difference between this and the body only.ConclusionIn the end it all comes down to what is important to you. Smaller weight and size is becoming much more important to me and this camera is a very good trade off of features for size and weight. Anything that is missing I don't even use so I am not sure what it may be. My D700 was recently stolen and while I miss it, the D7000 is a worthy replacement for it. I opted to get the D7000 and Panasonic GH2 and save the $300 difference for a lens.Pros--100% view finder!--6 fps (7D is 8. However, I think this number is overhyped in most cases. Even shooting at 3 FPS will fill up you card with photos that look remarkably similar) 8+ is needed for professionals shooting professional sports. Not enthusiast shooting High School etc.--16mp sensor (a marketing increase but still nice to allow some room for cropping)--14 bit photos--39 point auto focus sensors (19 cross point) this is a bit of a marketing thing but it is still nice and it does not matter about the 51 on D300s and above. Still very nice.--2016 scene meter - compares against data base for WB setting and color settings--Excellent battery life--MD-11 Optional Battery Grip--2 SD card slots for back up redundancy or double the card space! Outstanding--Magnesium used to make camera strongerCons--16mp senor (takes up more storage on your hard drive) (12mp JPG 3mb 12 mp RAW = 12 mb 16mp JPEG = 5 mb 16 mp RAW = 16 mb. This is for 12 bit. 14 bit would require more)--Camera heavier than it used to be--No swivel screen - after using the GH1 extensively you really miss this when shooting at weird angles. You especially miss it for macro photography.--No full time live view - Ditto from above. Live view is what you see is what you get. Forgot to change white balance-- you will see that when people are yellow, blue or green. Have it set in manual and blowing everything out-- you'll see that as a white screen.Decision MatrixNikonFor the Nikon shooter this is a no brainer. If you are in the market for a camera, then skip the D300s. The D700 is getting long in the tooth and many people are buying the D7000 while waiting for D800. If you already own a D700 then this camera is a very good complement to it. Use the money you saved over the more expensive camera to buy a nice lens.Here is a breakdown vs other Nikon DSLRsD3100-- Two completely different classes with the D7000 being worth the difference in many. However at the end of the day they will both make nice pictures. Also, the lenses are more important than the camera. You can get the D3100 and 18-200mm for the same price. Something to think about.D5000-- Good sensor and nice camera. D3100 comments also apply here.D90--Tough choice. The best DX sensor of its generation and still better than most. If you can't quite stretch to the D7000, this is a very tempting proposition.D300S-- Irrelevant.  The D7000 has a much better sensor, is smaller, lighter, cheaper, and better metering.Nikon D700-- Would be a good complement to the D7000. Use D7000 when you need the 1.5x crop on the long end and a deeper depth of field due to the smaller chip (about 1 stop deeper) and D700 for when you want to isolate a subject with a shallow depth of field or you want to use the full width of a wide angle such as the 14-24mm. If you don't need the shallower depth of field of a FX sensor and you have the lenses to cover the 1.5x crop then the D7000 should suit just fine. D3s and D3x -- Different leagues altogether. However, the D7000 is 90% of the camera for 1/4 to 1/6th the money.CanonThe 7D is an outstanding camera and while I think the D7000 is a better camera (better sensor, 2 SD card slots, 2016 RGB metering, Price) it is not that much better to warrant switching if you are already invested in lenses.SonyThe Sony SLT-A55 is a great camera but not in the league of the D7000. However it is $350 less and does have so unique properties.  It is rumored to have the same sensor as the D7000 but Nikon always does their magic and makes it better (D3x vs A900).  The translucent mirror allows for fast shooting but loses 1/3 a stop of light.  Still a very nice camera.Non-DSLR Owner or DSLR owner with just the Kit LensWhen you are buying a DSLR, you are really buying into the lens system.  So factor that into you decision making matrix.  For that reason, if you have not spent a fortune on lenses yet then I recommend the m4/3 as in my opinion that is the future.  The sensor of the top m4/3(GH2) is every bit as good if not better than the current crop of DX sensors and almost as good as the D7000.  It is getting to the point, the sensor doesn't matter as much.  At this point handling, size and weight start to become more important.With this in mind I would recommend the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black) to anyone not invested in a lens system. It is smaller, lighter, more capable on the video side and in many ways better on the stills side. It needs a faster flash sync speed, faster shutter speed and the construction is not up to Nikon or Canon standards (In all fairness this cuts down on weight and I have not had a failure with my GH1.)  It is probably not quite as good at the high ISO. On the positive side it has a multi-aspect sensor as it is actually an 18mp sensor (16:9, 2:3, and 4:3 will all be 16mp not crops of one aspect ratio) It sells for $899 body only, $999 with the 14-42mm and $1499 with the fantastic 14-140mm 10x zoom. The lack of a mirror flipping up is a benefit in all cases. Also, you can use just about any lens ever made on this camera. Nikon, Leica, Canon, Pentax, C Lenses. You lose auto focus on any auto focus lenses and there is no accurate way to adjust your aperture on G series lenses.  While the GH1 sensor was by far the best M4/3 sensor and equaled most DX sensors of its generation, it did not quite stand up to the D90 sensor. I expect the D7000 to have a higher Dynamic Range and be an overall better sensor. However, that difference will not be noticeable to the lay users. What you get is a noticeably smaller and lighter camera that out handles any DSLR on the market and has the best video capabilities. In my opinion the GH2 will be the best all-around camera of its generation. The GH1 is the camera I reach for 90% of the time when I shoot for pleasure. When Panasonic puts out a full Pro line of lenses, I will use it more in the Pro situations. I am sure the GH2 will be my new go to camera.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best DX (cropped) Camera To Date; Amazing ISO Performance", "Author": "J. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R2GK42CR93E3YY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first DSLR was a D80 I purchased four years ago.  The shutter went out a few weeks back but I had been planning to upgrade to the D7000 anyway so this just hurried things up.  I bought the D7000 kit with the 18-105 lens but quickly sold that on Ebay.  I was shooting with a Tamron 17-50 2.8 lens on the D80.  For low light, it worked pretty well but greater than half the time I needed to use my SB-600 flash to capture my young kids doing what they do (move).  The only downside to the Tamron, or combination of the Tamron with the D80, was that the images tended to be soft, especially when opened up.  So I also upgraded my lens to the Nikkor 16-85.  While this is a variable lens that maxes out at 3.5, it is amazingly sharp combined with the D7000.  And the extra reach is great for getting better shots and also providing relatively shallow depth of field that otherwise would be lost with the slower aperture.The reason I mention the lens change is that I wouldn't have gone to a variable lens had it not been for the amazing ISO performance on the D7000.  I am now shooting flashless at very fast shutter speeds.  I usually shoot raw and process with Lightroom and I'm seeing amazing results at 800 ISO even when fully blown up (1:1).  At ISO 1600, I can see minor noise but Lightroom 3's noise reduction easily eliminates it. 3200 certainly isn't noiseless but again, Lightroom can clean it up very well in most situations.  My old D80 had more noise at 400 than the D7000 has at 1600; I'd say 800 on it was equivalent to 3200 on the D7000.  I could see printing 1600 shots at smaller sizes with no need for software cleanup.  So while my results are preliminary (3 weeks in), I am astonished at the ISO capabilities of this camera.  I no longer have d700 envy and am glad I can get great dx lenses for under $700 as opposed to $1500 for fx.  Perfect for enthusiasts like me!You've seen the stat that the D7000 can shoot 6 shots per second.  The 6FPS shutter is in some ways overkill.  But if you shoot HDR/Bracket shots in quick succession having such a rapid shutter can allow you to do so handheld in a pinch. This is really only possible because of the high ISO capabilities enabling very fast shutter times. And for sporting events and the like, it's nice to have the ability to rapidly fire off shots.I have also noticed considerably improved metering and white balance on the D7000 compared to my old D80.  Of the 350 or so shots I've taken, I am spending much less time adjusting lighting and white balance in Lightroom.As others have mentioned, the ergonomics/design of the camera are quite good and I really enjoy the many direct access shortcuts for adjusting everything from focus to flash to white balance and much more.  The two custom settings are very easy to set and perfect for your two most common profiles (e.g. indoor portrait and outdoor landscape).  The screen is beautiful and moving in and around even RAW files is very smooth and fast.  I went with two 16GB SD class 10 Transcend cards and while I'm currently using the RAW 1 / JPEG 2 option, I plan to use the second as a backup card once I go to RAW only.I've only toyed with the video function but that was a part of my consideration since I dislike carrying two cameras, plus chargers and media, on family vacations.  The tests I've done in 1080P have been very impressive, albeit large as you would expect.  Auto-focusing while video recording is okay, as long as the background isn't too noisy or subjects too many.  The biggest downside I have experienced is the built-in microphone picks up lots of auto focusing noise.  I have not yet invested in an external mic but probably will need to.All in all I am very pleased with the D7000 and see no major shortcomings.  It's not cheap, but you get a lot for your money if you are in the market for a prosumer class DSLR.  For users who won't explore and use  the MANY options and capabilities of this camera, I would recommend considering the 3100/5100.  For D80/90 users who are ready to step up big time in terms of performance, this is the upgrade you have been waiting for.  Some will hold out for a D700 successor (D800 or whatever it ends up being called).  I have no doubt it will be an amazing camera but cost wise, you're going to be looking at $2500+ for the body alone and pay roughly double for coverage equivalent lenses.  So figure $4K just to get started.  Too rich for my non-professional needs but certainly should be considered if your work or wants dictate that level of camera.  And there maybe be a D300s replacement in the works too.  Still, I'd urge anyone to consider the D7000, which in my opinion is the best cropped sensor DSLR to date.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Backfocus issues and poor customer service", "Author": "B. Black", "ReviewID": "R1QNU5GLE2DYC0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Last Update: February 25, 2012 - Five months and counting.  Three times to the shop.  Same issue.I upgraded from a D3000 to a D7000 this year.  The capabilities of the camera had sold me and I wasn't quite ready to jump into full frame.  But after taking several pictures, I realized that the pictures were soft.  So I went looking online and found plenty of posts about backfocus issues with the D7000.  I broke out my D3000 and put it on a tripod in my kitchen and took one of my kids homework papers and stuck it on a cabinet.  I took pictures, put them up in lightroom and blew them up by the same factor.  Sure enough, My D3000 at 10MP had a sharper image than my D7000 at 16MP  Checked all of the settings twice.I created a ticket with Nikon and uploaded some images.  They didn't look at them and I had no response for days.  I finally called and asked for them to look at it.  They said they would look at them within 48 hours of sending the pics.  I responded they had been up there for several days.  I was then put on hold and the person came back and said it would be 24 hours.Fine.  2 days later, no call, no email.  I call back, I get apologies about them being busy.  The person looks at the pictures and asks for me to send more.3 more days, no response.  I finally get frustrated and take a comparison shot between two cameras to make it clear what the difference is.  I upload that.  Still no response.I finally call back and am told that they are not sure what the issue is but I can send in the camera if I want to.  (Really?)So I send in the camera.  I forget to include the receipt so I call up and ask how I can add the receipt.  This person is helpful and courteous and gives me the info.  I upload the receipt and wait.8 days later, no response.  Nothing.  Bupkis.  I call and ask if they have the camera.  Why yes they do, and it will be $169 for the repair...  No explanation of what is wrong, no question of when I bought it.  I said \"Wait, the camera is under warranty.\"  This person responds, \"well there is no receipt on the ticket\".  I asked, \"did you look at the ticket?\"  There is a pause, and then she says, \"These are all pictures\"  (Obviously Nikon hires rocket scientists) My response, \"take a look at the second to the last file that says D7000.pdf\".  Her response, \"We will need to certify that the repair is under warranty\".So now it is the day before Thanksgiving, at least I have my D3000 but the fact that Nikon has this kind of quality control issue, and then follows up with a crap customer service experience that can only be eclipsed by Hewlett Packard is just unbelievable.So if you do buy this camera, take some pictures, look at the detail.  If the edges look soft and fuzzy, take it back before your time runs out for a refund like mine did.Update Nov 25:This is service?Remember where the lady above said that they were going to need to certify that the repair is under warranty?  Well I called today to get an idea of when the camera would come back.  She didn't update the ticket.  The guy asked me for proof of purchase. *sigh*  I asked for a supervisor and made it clear that this kind of customer service was unacceptable.  We'll see what happens.At least I know what the repair is, it seems there is something wrong with the focusing motor and they have replaced it.Update Jan 1:Camera back, still soft pictures.So I get back from my international travel on Dec 16 and finally get to test out the camera.  Result?  Same issue is happening sporadically.  I can get it to reliably focus manually and take good pictures so it's not mechanical.  It could be variability in the motor or a sensor issue or even software.  It's difficult to replicate twice in a row.  But take a critical shot like my father in law heading back to LA after Christmas vacation and the whole shot is out of focus.  The focal point is right, the lighting is fine, no good reason for it.Tomorrow I raise another call.  I hope that I can simply get it exchanged, even for a rebuilt model.Update Jan 5:Going around in circlesRaised another call.  Agent asks me what the aperture and speed settings are at.  We discuss camera settings for a bit.  Do a reset.  I take more pictures.  Same issue.  He asks me to do an upload.  The ticket isn't enabled so I figured he would just open it up later so I can upload imagesUpdate Jan 8:Waiting on the service deskCall is still not opened up so I can update images.  I call in today and the agent is sending me shipping labels so I can send in the camera *again*.  I am going to call Visa and see if they can get the camera replaced.Update Jan 9:Still not workingVisa only comes into the picture once the 1-year warranty ends.  I haven't received the shipping labels yet, so I decided to methodically test the focusing issues.  I set up a tripod and various items in front of the camera with writing on them to see how it picked something to focus on and if the focal points matched up with the picture. Very often, where the camera says it's focusing isn't what it takes a picture of.  I used the 39 point and 11 point AF settings as well as varying steps of AF-A AF-S and AF-C.  Out of 20 pictures I had 1 that actually focused properly on the Sonicare toothbrush.  The rest either focused on the wrong thing or focused on the toothbrush but something else was in focus.  There is something in the logic of the camera that isn't right and replacing the motor won't fix it.Update Jan 18: Sent the camera backSo sent in the Camera again.  Filled out the survey and linked this review.  Hopefully they figure out that it isn't the motor.Update Jan 23:  No way to get in touch with Nikon outside of the 'service' desk.Called the service desk to check up on my camera status.  I asked what were the escalation options past talking to the service desk.  I didn't get a helpful answer but that's what you would expect from the front line.  So I get moved up to a fairly obnoxious supervisor.  So I find out that there is no other escalation number.  No contact information.  Nothing.  Short of sending a letter to the corporate address, which will probably get me nothing, there is nothing else I can do but stay on the merry-go-round.Update Feb 9: Camera is back in the shopUploaded more pictures and sent the body back in again.  I did find a way to escalate within the service department outside of the number and I am crossing my fingers that it actually gets fixed this time.  I took a picture of my son and just like the rest, his face is out of focus but the threads on his T-shirt are crystal clear.  It's unbelievable that they have sent this back to me twice now.Update Feb 25:  Was out of town for a couple of weeks and now I have the camera back in hand.  First few test shots, the issue is still there.  The setting now is on single point (as agreed with the tech) and still the same thing.  I have been able to get to Nikon corporate but I am not sure what else to do or can do at this point.  I may actually go down to Best Buy and buy a new one to do a side by side comparison and then return that one just to clearly demonstrate the issue.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply Superb -- and that's from a D700 owner...", "Author": "RonAnnArbor", "ReviewID": "R296LYLDTVRLEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me say that for the last (almost) two years I have been using the Nikon D700, and occasionally the D300s and D90 as a backup.When I saw the specs and reviews for the D7000 I knew I had to try it out -- and guess what -- I haven't used my D700 at all since getting my D7000...It feels great. It's light, but well made, feels secure and not at all \"plastic-y\" The controls and buttons are all terrific and a huge improvement from the D90.The camera, while easy to use, has all the bells and whistles, great image quality, and a good user interface. In fact, the shots look better out of the camera than with the D300s. In reality, the image quality is virtually indistinguishable from the D700 up to ISO 3200, and only slightly better on the D700 upto about 6400. There's no comparison higher, the D700 wins hands down. Sure the D700 is better at low-light shooting with its full size sensor -- but the D7000 absolutely has surprised me in this area as well.It has features you expect in Pro cameras, and I wouldnt be surprised to see the D7000 become the back-up camera of choice for full frame shooters.That being said -- the 18-105 lens is pretty week. I already have a great selection of DX lenses including the amazing 17-55 2.8 lens (there just isn't anything that looks and feels and works as well as that lens on an FX), and the 18-200. It's a joy to use these lenses again on a regular basis. The 18-105 is average at best, and I have eBayed mine already. You might want to get the body only if you already have DX lenses.And after a few event shoots with the D7000, it's a joy to use something that weighs half of what the D700 weighs. The reality is, I will most likely also purchase the D700 update when it eventually comes down the pike, but I might very well end up selling mine off for now while waiting for that.I am simply in love with this little camera -- it's by far Nikon's best current DX lens, and it even competes with their FX D700 for image quality.

In the past 24 hours I have logged 250 pictures and and I am impressed with the quality of the picture, and the ease of use with the camera.  You might be tempted to think it's just a glorified D90, but you would wrong.  It's better than the D90, and from what I am reading, better than the D300s which is more money.  The camera feels good in the hands, has a solid feel, is weatherproof, and overall speaks professional photographer.  For $1,500 in a kit, it is money well spent.I waited for the D7000 over any other DSLR for one reason: Auto-Focus in video mode.  It was worth the wait.  I had almost dropped the $1,400 on the Canon 60D but hesitated because the 60D was dumbed down in many ways by Canon so as to not impede on 7D sales.  Nikon went all out and demolished the need for the D300s, while making a DSLR worth having.  The video mode allows you to run auto-focus while shooting, which no other DSLR has done to this point.  Additionally, you can now shoot 1080p in 24 frames (23.97 actually) per second, which is cinema quality.  Also, you can shoot up to 20 minutes of video in one shoot, versus only 12 minutes for the Canon 60D, T2i, and T1i.  You may think you are buying the D7000 for photography only, but wait until you see what you can do with video.  Being able to do DOF shooting makes the DSLR video even more valuable, allowing you to do things you would have to spend thousands on in a professional camera.The D7000 may very well be Nikon's best DSLR in quite some time.

KING", "ReviewID": "R1N4C0WD3FGR5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In April of 2004, I bought my first DSLR, the Nikon D70.  I paid $1299.99 for the D70 and 18-70 kit lens.  I loved the D70 - it was good enough that I could resist the D80, D200, etc.  I spent my money on lenses instead.  Then along came the D7000.  I was nervous about jumping before DP Review has given their full report, but trusted Nikon and couldn't resist the specs.  Well, after several hundred shots I'm resting easy: this is an absolutely fantastic camera.If you're like me coming from the D70, the D7000 is a step forward by every objective and subjective measure.  I'm especially pleased with the D7000's new sensor.  Two and half times the resolution changed the way I frame shots.  I can pull back a bit during sports shooting to leave room for alignment corrections that eat up pixels at the edges.  Unlike the D70, ISO 1600 is quite usable and ISO 3200 viable.  I'm actually using Auto-ISO now, a feature I switched off in the D70 since I couldn't stand the noise.The back panel display is also a sight to behold.  With 7 times the resolution of the D70, the display is beautiful, bright and good enough to weed out poor shots on site.The D7000 ergonomics felt immediately comfortable to my Nikon fingers.  The only thing that made me pause was to locate the trash can button, which is now upper left rather than bottom right.Of course, many other pleasant surprises await, a customizable button, live view, Active D-Lighting, not to mention 1080P video.So, to those still snapping away with their D70's, this is the one!  Enjoy!!!-- EDIT --If you are interested in the various GPS adapters for location tagging, be aware the D7000 uses a USB style connector for GPS units.  This is different and incompatible with most other Nikon DSLRs.

I shoot mainly indoor sports primarily high school jazz and high-kick dance routines in low and lousy light typically. This camera is considerably better than the D90 in this area. Very sharp and bright images with little or no noise up to ISO 6400. I generally use a Nikon f/2.8 70-200mm VR lens which yields excellent results.2. 100% image as shown in viewfinder.3. New extra dial that lets you store two completely different sets of camera settings. This makes switching between two modes especially fast when needed.The negatives (only applies if you expect to shoot many shots quickly and in raw)1. One of the things even the expert reviewers are missing is that this camera at 16MP creates around a 20MB raw file. This isn't a problem for general use but when shooting rapid fire or shooting every second or so the buffer fills up before writing out to the card. You can take up to 10 shots at any speed you wish but once it is full you have to wait several seconds to open space to continue or take fewer shots which is what I do to not miss that all important moment. I never had this issue with the D90 - I could shoot as rapid as I wanted. Granted the image is much better/larger and in 14 or 12 bit raw but be aware of this limitation going in. When shooting JPEG, the buffer size increases considerably so if you normally shoot JPEG it might not be a problem.2. The dual card slot sounds great. There are several menu options to configure how you want the slots to behave; mirror so that as you take each photo the camera writes out to the other card at the same time. Sounds great for backup? It is great if you shoot slow or general stuff. However, shooting quick, fast shots, it slows the write process down even further to the point where it is not very useable. So I always opt for having the second card to act as overflow so when the first card fills up it automatically switches to the second card. This doesn't seem to slow it down. There are also several different configurations for the dual card slots. I would suggest downloading the user manual from Nikon prior to purchase to see if it will meet your needs.3. As you push the shutter release it is harder to determine when the shutter will close and slightly delayed on occasion compared to the D90 which was crisp and felt just right. Its not too bad once you get accustomed to it being more sensitive and know how to deal with it but at first you will notice a sharp contrast.4. I added a battery grip which makes the camera balance and grip much better especially with the larger lens for going into portrait position. Nice features on it and well positioned. However, its a trade off in that you have to take the grip off every time you want to charge the battery that remains in the camera. Only one battery is in this battery grip vs. the design made for the D90 which was two.In general I highly recommend this camera despite the comments above. The limitations above are something to be aware of for my shooting conditions. If these don't match how you plan to use the camera you will be delighted by it's performance over the D90. You will still be delighted in any case.I also have used the D700 and D3 and I would say this camera produces images comparable to the D700 in in some cases superior. It's not D3 or D3X class but the images are hard to distinguish until you get into really low light situations.No difference:The magnesium body vs plastic body. I didn't really notice the difference between the two cameras. They feel and look about the same and weigh very close.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thoughts on the D7000, D700, and D5100", "Author": "Edubya in Texas", "ReviewID": "R2QO09XFSPQREZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went a little crazy last year and bought a D700. I learned that camera pretty well and absolutely loved shooting with it. But I am an amateur and always felt a little guilty having spent that much money on a hobby. What's more, the D700 is big and heavy compared to amateur cameras (it's an awesome size for pros), and I actually found myself leaving it at home on occasion because of that size and weight. So when the D7000 was out for a bit and received such good reviews, I jumped.I fell in love with the D7000 immediately and sold the D700. Of course, I would have kept both if I could justify the cash, but the D7000 is so good that I usually don't feel like I'm missing much. There are quite a few interesting points to be made comparing the two cameras, but I recognize that the average shopper would not be considering the two in the same class, so I'll just say I'd be happy to answer questions in the comments. The short version is that while the D700 produces slightly better images and generally handles better, the D7000 is at least 90% the camera for the half the price and is better suited to the amateur shooter in several respects.So why do I like it so much?-Beautiful images, of course.-Low light performance is extremely admirable for a DX sensor.-100% viewfinder-Flash commander mode for using flash off-camera-The right amount of heft and size for my taste. Build feels excellent, and it's got weatherproofing!-Dual SD cards are a nice touch.-Handling is great. U1 and U2 modes are a wonderful addition. Nikon's command dials have a nice feel and are extremely useful.-I didn't buy this camera for video, but the video looks great IF you handle it right. Think movie camera rather than family video cam.What I don't like as much?-Buffer is a bit small when shooting NEF (RAW). It doesn't affect me because I don't shoot much action, but heavy sport shooting could be difficult in NEF.-SD cards still aren't as fast as CF cards.-Viewfinder is a nice size for DX, but it's still nowhere near the size of an FX viewfinder.-I think I prefer the AF selector on the D700 by a hair. One finger vs two. Not that big a deal.-See above, but video is obviously not as easy as a dedicated video camera. Who cares?I mentioned the D5100 in my title because I think many people are wondering if the D7000 is worth the extra cost over the D5100. The short answer is that it depends on how serious of a shooter you are. Do you understand the relationship between shutter speed, aperture, and ISO? If the answer is \"No, and I don't care,\" stop reading and buy the D5100, or even the D3100. Do you want to film your kids playing soccer? The D5100 is better suited for that, although I'd really suggest you buy a dedicated video camera. These are primarily still cameras after all. If you're a more advanced shooter, or you'd like to become one, consider the following:Some people say the D5100 has the same sensor and the option to shoot video at 30 fps, so why would you possibly want a D7000 instead? There are several very important upgrades that the D5100 does NOT have, some of which I could not live without:-Flash commander mode: Enables you to shoot your external flash or flashes off camera. Huge capability.-Continuous shooting speed is 6 fps vs 4 fps.-Battery life is far superior-Dual SD cards. Not critical, but a very nice feature for backup especially.-Lossless compressed 14-bit NEFs. Probably not a deal breaker, but I want every bit of quality available from that sensor!-100% viewfinder vs 95%. I didn't know I wanted it until I got it.-Non AF-S lens compatible (for autofocusing), Will meter with AI lenses. Another huge feature. I can use my 30-year-old 85mm f/2 lens.-Faster shutter-Better AF system. Another big deal for dynamic shooting situations.-Flash bracketingThe D5100 is cheaper, lighter, has a swiveling screen, and shoots video at 30 fps.At $300 more, I think the D7000 is an excellent value compared to the D5100 when you consider the extra features it has.What else can I say that hasn't already been said elsewhere? The D7000 is the camera to beat in this class, if you know how to shoot, and often, even if you don't.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another one with focus problems", "Author": "Mikey likes it", "ReviewID": "R39Q6GYZJQL9VV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a D5100 and exchanged it for the D7000, which was back focusing, making many images (especially those at close range) soft. If the D7000 focused precisely out of the box, as it's supposed to, I would have kept it, since I liked all of the other features it has. All of my photos from the D5100 were sharp using the same lenses, so the lenses weren't the problem. I tried AF fine tuning and it helped a little, but not enough, even after reaching the maximum adjustment factor. A camera at this price level should have better quality control. Sure there are manufacturing tolerances, but they should be able to get the most critical assemblies close enough so the camera at least focuses properly, rather than hoping that customers won't notice or requiring them to spend hours fine tuning the AF, sometimes to no avail. It seems like getting a good D7000 depends quite a bit on luck. I've yet to decide if I'll try another D7000 or if I'll just go back to a D5100.The D7000 also overexposes in bright/high contrast situations when using matrix metering, causing highlights to be clipped and detail to be lost. Some say that this is just the advanced metering system working as intended. Perhaps, but it requires the user to use negative exposure compensation whenever a shot like this is taken (or to program it into one of the \"U\" settings). You don't always have time to do this when a a good photo op comes around. IMHO, this is a significant flaw that should be corrected via a firmware update.BTW, some have stated that the D7000 has better IQ than the D5100. All reviews I've read state that they are exactly the same in IQ, or that the diff is so small that it's negligible. This is consistent with my experience. In certain situations, like sports and low-light fast motion shots, the D7000's better AF and metering might help produce better photos, but for everything else, they're pretty much the same.UPDATE: I decided to give the D7000 another chance and ordered a second one. Same backfocusing problem. This time, adjusting the AF fine tuning by a factor of -4 for all of my lenses results in sharp focus, but using AF fine tuning isn't an ideal solution, since it causes the camera to not focus properly at infinity or at minimum focusing distance. Depending on the degree of AF tuning required, this could then require the user to manually adjust the focus ring after the AF has \"reached its limit\" (the limit which has changed due to the use of AF fine tuning). Another unnecessary hassle you need to remember to take care of. The AF fine tuning feature is nice to have, but its purpose is to dial-in lenses that are a bit off due to manufacturing tolerance. I don't think it was intended to adjust a faulty body to work with lenses that are in spec, but that's the way it's often being used.For anyone who buys a D7000, I'd recommend doing a focus test as soon as you get it, to ensure that you're getting the IQ you paid for. The best way to do this is with a focus test chart, but a quick and dirty method is to tape a page of text on the wall (make sure it's totally flat against the wall). Then, mount your camera on a tripod perpindicular to the wall, with lens (set at the largest aperture) at the same height as the page. Take a shot or two using autofocus through the viewfinder. Use the remote or self timer, with mirror lockup. Then take some shots using live view. If the AF photos are not as sharp as the LV shots (or at least very close to them in sharpness), your AF is off (most likely back focusing).", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Image Quality and Features", "Author": "Jimmy K", "ReviewID": "R18282MH2U9GRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Auto Focus (AF).  I want to provide my experience with the camera and my take on the AF situation.1. Back-focus.  Some claim their units have back-focus issue.  The camera does have AF fine-tune that can be used to correct the focus.  But if amount of back-focus extends outside the fine-tune range, then it will require Nikon service.  I'm sure there are units that do indeed back-focus and need repair.  But I suspect many more users mistakenly and incorrectly attribute any AF issue with back-focus.  Anyone who says their unit back-focus sometimes or % of photos, then that is not true back-focus issue.  Back-focus means the AF is not calibrated correctly.  It will not focus right sometimes and miss focus sometimes.  So I suspect the rate of true back-focus (quality control issue) is smaller than people claim.2. Auto Focus learning curve.  There is definitely learning curve on getting the D7000 to focus correctly.  D7000 is very sensitive and this learning curve is steeper than expected.  It will takes some practice (and possibly changing your shooting method) to get the focus consistently correct.My experience.  When I first got the camera, at least 50% of my images are soft for 1 reason or another.  There are out of focus images, camera shakes, subject motion (try taking photo of baby and toddler who are constantly on the move), etc.  I thought I had \"back-focus\" issue.  After doing AF test, I confirmed there is no back-focus.  But there is still AF reliability.  After couple months reading web forums (particularly dpreview), I finally learned the tricks on improving the AF reliability.First off, why so many people (including me) had problem with AF?  My take:- 16 meg.  With 16 meg, you can zoom in to 1:1 and still see quite a bit of details.  So any out of focus shots will be very apparent 1:1.  This might not be the case with older DSLR with less than 12 meg.- AF sensor.  Web forums stated that the AF sensor size is larger than what users see in the viewfinder.  This can cause confusion on exactly where the camera focuses.  Sometimes the AF sensor focus on more contrasty region outside the AF box, which is not what the photographer intended.Here are the suggestion on focus:- Use 9-point dynamic AF area mode.- Use the center AF point only, rather than the other 11 or 39 AF points.The center 9 AF points are cross type, so they can focus on both vertical and horizontal features.  The other AF points are either vertical or horizontal, which are not as sensitive.  If using the center AF point with 9-point dynamic AF area mode, then all the center 9 cross-type AF sensors are being actively used.- Use AF-C, not AF-S.  With AF-C, the focus is continuously being updated.  While focus is activated, move the camera ever so slightly, so the subject (area where you want to focus on) is being moved around the AF box in the viewfinder.  As you are doing this, the focus is being updated and improved.  When the focus stops changing (you can hear it in the lens) even as camera is being move slightly, then you know you have focus locked.  You probably don't have to do this all the time.  But for subject that can move (like kids and pets), indoors (lower light), and low contrast subjects, this really helps.- Use 1/250 sec or faster shutter speeds.  I was used to using 1/90 sec and sometimes down to 1/60 or 1/45 sec on P&S.;  There is no way I can use these low shutter speed without camera shake and blur on D7000.  I basically use 1/250 sec or faster, even with VR lens.  I sometimes push to 1/180 sec when needed, but I notice more blurry photos.  Your mileage can vary depending on how steady your hands are.  But expect to use faster shutter speeds than you are used to.- Use AF-ON.  Personal taste.  I just find using AF-ON with AF-C together works better.- If your lens is VR, make sure you hold the shutter button half-press for 1 sec before clicking, because it takes some time for the VR to settle.  This is particularly true if you use AF-ON for focusing.Even with the AF learning curve, I still rate D7000 5 Stars.  I have being using D7000 for over 1 year now.  The image quality, low light performance, dynamic range, and features are just incredible.  Luckily, I'm able to figure out the AF issue (or non-issue) 2-3 months after I got the camera.  Now, I don't even think about the AF while shooting.  I can keep my attention on the subject and framing; and enjoy the resulting images.If you don't want to deal with the AF learning curve, then stay away from D7000.  Out of focus photos are no fun and there is no way to recover those images.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "D7000 - Meets and maybe exceeds the D300 as a serious performance DX camera", "Author": "Kay One", "ReviewID": "RTC050HW79MQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: 1. 16.2 MP image sensor2. weather sealing similar to the D3003.

RAW files not yet recognized by 3rd party software at time of this writing3. still not weight balanced when using larger telephoto zoom lens4. difficult to think of any real consSummary: Being a Nikon D90 user for the last year, I love the combination of ease of use, shooting power and image quality. However over time I quickly grew to learn and appreciate the performance limits (fps shooting, ISO range, 12 bit RAW files only) that are addressed by the more expensive and professional level D300.Imagine to my shock when Nikon announced several months ago a successor to the D90, initially dubbed the D95 then finalized as the D7000. When the spec sheets were announced, my jaw dropped. Basically what we have is a camera that is priced between the pro-am D90 and pro D300 DX crop sensor cameras. While the D7000 clearly and unsurprisingly outclasses the very competent and capable D90 in nearly every respect, from image quality, shooting performance and video capabilities, whats more shocking is how it seems to match or even exceed the specs of the D300s (if youre taking video shooting capabilities into account).I was lucky to pick up a preorder of the 18-105mm kit from a local store (body only was not available yet at the time of this writing) and with excitement I set about opening it up. Packaged very similar to the D90, the camera comes with the 18-105mm VR kit lens in a separate box and instruction manuals/software CD. A nice change is the battery charger which comes with the usual long cable, but also has a short outlet plug that allows the charger to mount directly to the wall, much like most compact P&S; camera battery chargers.Onto the camera itself. As I've mentioned before, users of the Nikon D90 should find this new camera very easy to use, as nearly all the buttons, menus and controls are identical. They changed the live view button to a spring loaded switch similar to the D3100 with a button that is used to start/stop video recording. I tested the video at 1080p/24 fps and like the previews state, it does continuous AF during the recording unlike previous Nikon HD video dSLRs, however with the built in mic, the AF is LOUD and you can hear it whirring constantly in the video playback. If you want to shoot some serious video you're better off getting the optional external stereo mic that fits in the hotshoe.Now onto the camera shooting itself. Having the 100% viewfinder coverage is nice, since the 96% coverage on the D90 made for some errors in composition, allowing objects to creep into the edges of my previous shots that I couldn't see due to the incomplete coverage.The new 39 point AF with 11 cross type AF points is amazingly fast, and you can set to single AF so it only does it once before you shoot, or continuous AF so it'll continue to seek out AF points while the shutter is half pressed.Shooting speed is FAST on this camera, at a respectable 6 fps at max speed, although you'll need at least a class 10 SD card to acheive this, and it maybe slightly slowed choosing 14 over 12 bit NEF RAW files. Speaking of which, like the D300, 700 and D3, you can shoot 14 bit RAW files now where the D90 and lower end cameras allowed you to only shoot 12 bit RAW which made for inferior picture quality in the final images.The dual SD card slots are a great feature and the camera gives you multiple options how you want to use these cards, I chose to set mine up as overflow, altho when I start to shoot video I may set up the 2nd card as video only instead.Now my favorite aspect of this camera, is not, contrary to some, the increased 16.2 MP over the 12.6 MP of the D90/300 image sensor, but the amazing ISO range and low light sensitivity. The D90 had a range of 200-3200 but images became pretty unusable above 2400 without serious software PP NR. I did some nighttime and indoor low light test shooting of the D7000 with its 100-6400 range and found images that looks better at 4000 than the D90 did at 2000 ISO. At 5000 or above, the noise does start to become noticable, but this new sensor plus a good image stabilized lens makes for a powerful low light shooter in most situations. I've read subject user reviews from people who own the D300 and FX sensor D700 and say this camera gives the D300 serious pause and in fact, can compare image quality to the D700.Something to think about.Overall this is a fantastic camera for the price and probably the last DX sensor camera I will need for a long time.", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon's Best DX Camera", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R18DX4DSTYOXS9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my D7000 as an upgrade from my D80, which was itself an upgrade from the D50. I'm not one to buy a new dSLR every couple of years; I have been wanting to migrate from the D80 for awhile now because I don't like its meter, which consistently overexposed and blew out the highlights in pictures. I considered the D90, of course, but it wasn't quite enough to make me take the plunge. The D7000 is. I don't understand Nikon's naming convention on this camera, though: Prior to this, the pro-level cameras had one numeric digit (D1, D2, D3), the enthusiast-level cameras had two digits (D40-D60 for lower end, D70-D90 for higher end), and the newer consumer-level cameras had four digits (D3100, D5000). The D7000 in no way belongs in the same class as any consumer-grade camera. Nikon may have created an entirely different class of dSLR here. It beats every two-digit camera they've made, and might even render the amazing D300s largely irrelevant, but that's just an opinion. So, Nikon's inconsistent nomenclature notwithstanding, this camera is fantastic in nearly every way.Suffice it to say that anyone interested in this camera knows the specs. Nothing in the marketing blurbs, however, can convey the way the D7000 feels and operates in the hands of a photographer. This camera just hums. It feels solid and professional, the buttons and dials are thoughtfully placed (no surprise there... ergonomics and build quality are why I shoot with Nikon), and the performance is just breathtaking. The D7000 borrows numerous features from its pro-grade lineup, such as blazing speed (largely unnecessary but still impressive at 6 fps), magnesium alloy body, virtual horizon, user-defined controls for entire banks of settings, etc. And it gets some features of its own, like 14-bit processing, a new processing engine, a newly-designed 16.2 MP sensor, vastly improved metering (much better than my D80), an intervalometer (for unsupervised timed interval shooting), and 100% viewfinder coverage. A full range of \"live\" adaptive dynamic range lighting control (called \"D-lighting\") is available, including an \"AUTO\" setting my D80 lacked. This really helps with high-contrast scenes, preserving the detail in the light areas while bringing out some of the details in the shadows. Focusing is fast, fast, fast, even with my non-Nikkor lens, which had regular problems on the D80. The D7000 manages it perfectly. Obviously, performance with my Nikkor lenses is silent, fast, and flawless. All of this translates into a remarkable experience for the experienced photographer. Playback is great too -- fast response when zooming (including diagonal zooming), and a new feature called \"Face Playback\" or something like that which is actually as useful as it is gimmicky, unlike most things like this which are more gimmicky than useful in real-world applications. When zooming in on a photo with people in it, the screen puts a small white box around all the faces. Set the zoom level, then use the front dial button to move instantly from face to face. Use the main (rear) dial to move to the next picture at the same zoom level. It's really useful and fun for checking to see if everyone is smiling and has their eyes open in a group photo. It's definitely gimmicky, since it's not strictly necessary, but in this case, it's actually quite useful, too. I enjoy this feature.The menus are logically laid out, and pressing the \"?\" button offers more in-depth information on any of the myriad features and functions in the menus. Everything is HIGHLY customizable... you can easily spend several hours playing with menu settings, but owing to Nikon's liberal sprinkling of dedicated buttons and controls on the D7000 body, you won't need to dive into the menus very often after the initial tweaks are made. The superb degree of customization possible is what pushes the D7000 solidly into the very high end of enthusiast cameras. If you tend to leave your dSLR set on AUTO nearly all the time, don't waste the money on the D7000; buy the excellent D3100 instead. It's got many of the same features for half the price.Battery life on the D7000 is completely insane. For even an enthusiast shooter, one full charge can easily last a week of shooting 100+ photos per day. Going on a weekend vacation? A week? Leave the charger at home. I took it on a six-day trip to Thailand and lost only one segment on the battery meter during that time (although to be fair, I didn't shoot hundreds and hundreds of photos). The D7000 is rated at 1,050 shots per charge, and I believe it based on my own usage so far. This is nothing particularly jaw-dropping for me, though: the D80 battery lasts forever, too. I also love the twin SD card slots with their multiple options for use: overflow, backup, dedicated video/RAW assignment... brilliant.As reported, low-light performance is excellent, particularly with a fast lens. Even with a standard f/3.5 zoom, the lack of noise in ISOs up to 1600 means you won't be popping that flash up very often. I use my SB-600 speedlight now almost exclusively for wireless creative lighting techniques, not to actually supply light needed for a photo. At ISO 800, shooting handheld indoors is a breeze. When you do use the flash (for fill-flash situations, for example), it's pretty much perfect, typical for Nikon.This is a serious rival for Canon's 60D, which I'd suggest is the D7000's only real competition in this class of dSLR. I'd say the D7000 beats the 60D in most real-world respects (though some of that is based on my own preference for Nikon's ergonomics), although I understand the 60D is superb for video. I'm not a videographer, so I can't really comment on that. (I can add that, in playing around with it, I do find the autofocusing during video shooting to be pretty bad.) The vast majority of the time, I'll be using my D7000 for still photography. I'd take the D7000 over the D300s, and the doubling of price doesn't warrant the purchase of the fantastic D700 (for me, at least).I was lucky to get this camera at all given Nikon's continuing supply/demand issues. Even though it was released three months ago, it's near-impossible to find it in stock anywhere. I live outside the US currently and was, happily, able to get a D7000 body at a Nikon retailer for about the same price (when converted) as it should sell for in the States, about $1,200.Money well-spent, I must say.For me, upgrading from the D80, the chief improvements were: - The meter. Metering on the D80 was pretty bad, in all honesty. The D7000 is far, far better at reading the light, which is the most crucial point of photography. This excellent full-color RGB meter, in concert with active D-lighting (for high-contrast scenes), and seriously intelligent metering algorithms, makes getting the \"right shot\" much more effortless. - White balance. One of the most critical settings in digital photography, and the D7000 handles it brilliantly with so many nuanced settings and adjustments possible. Love it. - Fantastic high-ISO performance. I rarely ever use the built-in flash and when I use my SB-600, it's typically off-camera use for fun or creative lighting effects. The D7000 handles low-light shooting amazingly well, especially when used with a fast lens like my Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 prime. Even with a f/3.5-4.5 or 5.6 zoom, performance is impressive. - The 3-inch 921,000-dot LCD. The D80's LCD is quite good... until you've spent a couple of days with the D7000. If you're upgrading from the D70/s to the D7000, it's like an entirely new world. Though it's not an articulating LCD like the one on the Canon 60D, the LCD on the D7000 is still completely fantastic. Super-sharp, bright, and responsive. - U1 and U2 user-defined settings. Wow, I love this! I wish there were 3 or 4 settings, but having even two memories for entire banks of complex camera settings is great. The preloaded \"scene\" settings are also on an entirely different level from the D80 (you set \"Scene\" on the left dial, press \"info,\" then use the command dial to choose from tons of scene options on the main LCD), if you care to use Nikon's predefined scene algorithms. I used a couple (sunset, food) to test them out and the results were quite good. - 1080p movies and Live View. I don't envision using the D7000 to shoot a lot of movies, but even having that capability is an obvious benefit over the D80. - User-defined menu creation. You can put your most-used menu commands into a separate menu for your personal use and easy, single menu-level access. I really like this feature. - Seems to handle off-brand lenses better. Three of my lenses are Nikkors, but two are Tamrons. On my 18-250mm Tamron, the D80 would routinely struggle with it, either taking some time to autofocus or \"losing\" the lens altogether. The display would simply read \"F --\" as if there were no lens attached. I'd either have to remove and reattach the lens or switch the camera off and back on. This has never happened with the D7000. - The \"info\" button that puts all of the information that's on the top LCD screen, and a lot more, on the big, color rear LCD screen. I realize numerous newer Nikons do this, but the D80 didn't, so this is a quantum leap for me. - The integrated sensor cleaner. I presume it's ultrasonic and just vibrates any errant dust particles off the sensor. You can set this to occur every time the camera is switched on, or activate it on demand. My D80 had no such feature. - More megapixels. You'll notice this is last on the list because it doesn't really make that big a difference. The resolution of the D80 was amply sufficient and I still get awesome shots on my 7.2-MP point and shoot Casio EX-Z750, which I continue to love. But 16.2 MP allows for easy cropping with no real loss of useful resolution, so it's definitely a big step up from the 10.1 MP of the D80.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Back Focus Problem", "Author": "Frank Hebert \"Daddy-O\"", "ReviewID": "RM172K1N9VKLJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I own the Nikon D80 and was looking for an upgrade camera without breaking the bank. Researched the D7000 and was everything i was looking for and then some.i have owned the D7000 for approximately 3 weeks now. i have taken hundreds of photos since i received it. i went from the D80 10MP to 16MP. At first i thought i was not understanding my camera and these 39 Focus Points compared to the D80's eleven FP.i took some low light/ evening photos and the camera really captured well. i was not using a tripod and i put the focus problem on them being handheld pics.

Nearly 95% of my photos are terrible and unusable, due to the Back Focus problem. On the camera review screen it is not an issue but once i got home and downloaded 250 pictures it is extremely noticeable focus problems. Group photos had all the front row people out of focus and the scenery 20 foot behind crystal clear.i thought it was user error (new camera/39 FP) But the more i shot and tried different lens, different settings no better.i even let a pro friend of mine try and and she said it is definitely a back focus issue.Conclusion:I LOVED the D7000 compared to my D80 in ergonomics, weight, and screen size.I cannot comment on the optics and picture quality because none of the photos i took came out correct.i am sending the camera back to AMAZON. i hope to repurchase another D7000 soon when they are back in stock. I will give it one more try before completely condemning the D7000.UPDATE 8-13-2012My D7K was stolen in April 2012. I purchased another one in June. It had a focus problem, i say this because i again sent NIKON some test pictures and they confirmed a problem and told me to send it in for repair. I had already returned the camera to Amazon who gave me a refund instead of shipping me a new camera.

Fuller +).  Please just allow me to add a few considerations.I now have my second D7000.  The first one was from the very first batch shipped and several in this batch had focusing problems (many comments on DPReview).  With all lenses, and most noticeably at their maximum zoom setting, the focus was terrible.  This second camera is perfect. I would guess Nikon fixed a bug in their setup routine (think Hubble :-)A second problem receiving numerous comments concerns \"hot pixels\" in live view / video mode at high ISO settings and dark surroundings.  All sensors have a few pixels that are defective, are mapped, and are \"fixed\" to look like their neighboring pixels.  This makes it a near zero problem.  Unfortunately in live view / video mode the D7000 does not \"hide\" these pixels.  My current D7000 has one annoying red pixel that is easily visible about 1/3 of the time on an HDTV monitor when shooting indoors.  According to DPReview, Nikon has announced a new firmware release to solve this problem.  It is no longer a concern of mine.I have also spent a fair bit of time comparing lenses (Koren 203 lens test chart - plus printed text and fabrics).  The unexpected result is that the 18 to 105mm kit lens is nearly equal to my 60mm micro Nikkor D lens in the 18 to 35mm range (f-8).  My 70 - 300mm lens (F/4.5-5.6 G IF-ED) was better than the 28 - 300mm (f 3.5 -5.6 G ED VR) in the 70 to 200 range but not quite as good at 300.  The 70 - 300 produces equal centers and slightly sharper edges than the kit lens at 70mm and up.  All my tests were done using jpg files with the camera setting bumped one notch for both sharpness and contrast.  The differences are much less obvious and far less important in real world use.  Photos of a large blooming orchid plant look almost equal on 13\" x 19\" prints when I was careful with the f-stop (if in doubt use f-8).Update:  I have tested this camera in various light situations.  The dynamic range system works quite well but there are occasions where you can not trust the camera's auto metering.  DPReview noted: \"Tendency to overexpose in bright sunshine/high contrast situations\".  A few of my daylight photos confirm that you need to be watchful in bright sun.  I would suggest routinely setting the exposure compensation -2/3 rds stop (down) outdoors on a sunny day. There are other suggestions on the internet but this is by far the easiest to remember and undo for me.  Nikon did not confirm or deny if they will include an adjustment for this in their firmware release.A video note:The focusing during video shooting tends to hunt and be noisy.  The noise is more noticeable when reviewing in camera than on an HDTV system.  One solution is to think \"producer\" and edit together a series of shots instead of continuous shooting.Update: The Sennheiser MKE 400 Shotgun Microphone was a nice addition for video.  The focus noise becomes less noticeable and the quality is very good.  The mic is quite compact and does not make the set up look too over the top.  It seemed better to use a medium mic sensitivity (2) than AGC when shooting.Within the camera setup there are a number of focus options including changing the delay time before the camera tries to refocus (0 delay and 5 other options).  There are many other options including subject tracking and facial recognition.  The method I am currently using is to set it to center refocus when I half press the shutter release.  I have made the mistake of fully depressing it though, and that terminates recording.  If you are primarily interested in video the Panasonic GH1 / 2 is more designed for that.  The D7000 is spectacular still camera first, and capable of beautiful video when carefully used second.A personal bias:I believe the D7000 is capable of more than many of the Nikon DX lenses are delivering.  Great lenses are a strength of Nikon, let's keep the heat on them to design lenses that maximize the images from their DX cameras too.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Impressed.  DON'T FEAR the focus!  An excellent choice for the learning photographer.", "Author": "J. Evans \"jenb1972\"", "ReviewID": "R3FRSV7G59GI79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to admit, after researching this camera I was nervous about purchasing this due to the many posts about focus issues, but after 1.5 years of using a d5100, I found that I really needed more accessible control to get to the next level.  I have a large investment in Nikon DX lenses so getting an FX camera was just not an option.  The new D600 has the ability to shoot DX, but it is far from ideal and the cost of the D600 body was out of my price range.  I also really have no need for a full frame, the cropped frame provides me with excellent photos.  When the price of the D7000 dropped to below $900 and with Amazon's awesome customer service, I knew it was time to buy.  If there was indeed a problem, I knew I could return it.FIRST IMPRESSION:  Upon opening the box, I knew that this was exactly what I was looking for.  Although a little larger than my 5100, the buttons and dials and top display screen is leaps and bounds better than the 5100.  Finally...no menu-digging to adjust settings!  I charged up the battery and started shooting.  My first set of shots were taken with all the default settings in AUTO mode.  The result?  All of the photos were soft.  Disappointment.  Could I have gotten one of the \"bad\" cameras?  I wasn't ready to say that yet, besides, many photo gurus have touted the amazing quality of this camera.  I picked up David Bush's Guide to the d7000 and learned a bit on HOW the d7000 Autofocus actually works.  With a few changes to the settings and a bit more insight into the autofocus system, I was shooting tack-sharp photos within an hour.DEFAULT SETTING CHANGES: The first thing you should do when you get this camera is change the JPEG image quality form NORM to FINE.  Then turn OFF the Hi ISO NR (noise reduction), which is degrades the detail in your shots in order to reduce noise, creating a softer image.  I choose to set the dynamic-area AF to 21 point which will help with speed (although I have to say this camera's focus speed is phenomenal compared to the 5100).  Use AF-C or AF-S.  This camera has 3 autofocus modes - AF-A, AF-S and AF-C.  I found that when I use AF-A, I tend to get more soft shots.  Once I move to AF-S or AF-C, my photos become beautifully sharp.Finally, you really need to have a grasp of how your aperture affects you DOF (depth of field).  Using a larger aperture produces a very small DOF.  If you are relying on the camera to make these decisions for you, you may not get the shot you are looking for.  The camera may be smart for getting the correct exposure, but it doesn't know what you are thinking!  A good rule of thumb is to use at least f/5.6 - f/8 for portraits and make sure your focus point(s) are set on the eyes.  Set focus, lock and recompose if needed.  You will notice a significant difference in the clarity of your photos.  Finally, use a decent lens!!!  My Tamron 28-75mm 2.8 is a solid performer on this body.MY RECOMMENDATION: I am by no means a \"professional\", but I do have a working knowledge of how to use a dslr.  If you are looking for a camera that you pull out of the box and expect perfect shots while set in automode, this camera is not for you...you are better off investing in a high end point and shoot.  If you know something about ISO, Shutter, Aperture, AF-S, AF-C, Metering and plan on growing that knowledge and want to rely on your ability instead of the camera, the d7000 is a gem at a great price.  If you want something in-between, consider the d3100 or the d5100.  Both of which are less expensive and are solid performers.  The d7000 is the perfect answer for those looking for easy access and control over their images.MY OPINION:  While I'm sure there are d7000s out there that do indeed have a focus problem, I'm pretty sure that many of the complaints may be due to not taking the time to truly understand the camera and how it works.  While the autofocus is awesome, it is NOT perfect and requires the person to take control, which is the point of buying a dslr anyway, isn't it?  Just because it costs more doesn't mean it should excel at being a point and shoot!THE BOTTOM LINE:  Don't be afraid of buying this camera because of the publicized \"focus\" issues.****UPDATE****I've had this camera for well over a month now and I can't tell you how ecstatic I am with it.  After getting comfortable with the camera and its controls, and learning all the sweet-spots on my lenses, I feel that this camera has pushed me to the next level in my photography journey.  I have been able to produce tack sharp image after tack sharp image.  I'm finding that I'm doing much less editing with this camera than I had with my 5100.  I think this is partially due to the camera and partially due to learning more and having the ability to easily control manual settings.

During that year it has been through hell constantly. Its been all over the country, and all over a war zone. I want to start by saying, this is truly a rugged camera. I am a Combat Photographer for the army. I use my own equipment as my command is cheap and worthless. Currently, I am deployed overseas and this camera gets used every day.I chose the D7K a year ago because of a few things. Things that are unlike mosts.1: Its rugged and weather sealed. While it does occasionally see a downpour it spends a lot of time dealing with very high levels of dust. I do a full service on it about once a month and each time, There is literally no dust where there shouldn't be. For rain, Make sure you get a lens with a weather seal. Not even the Kit lens has a weather seal. I use mainly a 28, 35 and 50 prime. They all have weather seals and have all been used in heavy rain, no water got passed the lens into the camera. When I say heavy rain, I truly mean the worst rain your mind can imagine. This camera will take it. Though, touching on Rugged, I must say the Kit lens 18-105mm is a good lens IQ wise, not bad for a kit lens, in fact Id say its the best kit lens for a non pro camera. Though, aside from IQ This lens is NOT rugged, in fact, its cheap. The mount is plastic, the barrel is cheap plastic and after so little use (mainly use primes and my 2.8 zooms) part of the outer barrel broke while zooming. I'd say go for the body only and get a good fast prime or a 2.8 zoom. Something that is as rugged as the camera.2: Its light. The D7000 is really an easy camera to carry around. Slap a 35 or 50mm pancake lens on it and you can pocket it. (army pants... big pockets) It fits easy in pouches/bags and is light enough to cart around all day. I don't use the neck strap, I either use a shoulder harness or a wrist strap. super easy to weald, point and shoot. Buttons are in the right spots and with a battery grip its still not too heavy. Just right.3: Movies: Normally, Id carry around a Sony video camera and a DSLR. This was troublesome switching back and forth, lots of photos or video footage lost just changing back and forth. The D7000 does not take as good of video as my Sony did, though the Sony costs more than the D7000 and is made for Video. However, The D7K DOES take amazing footage and has full manual video. having my DSLR shoot video and photos has allowed me to carry less and shoot more photos and video. Being able to use my DSLR lenses to shoot video has saved me money from buying different glass for my video camera to do the same thing, Planning on selling the Sony when I get back as I just don't use it, sits in a case now. The D7K lacks a Audio monitor port which is a flaw IMO. However, I use a Zoom audio recorder and I can plug my headphones into it to monitor audio. I also use a RODE video mic pro. The internal mic is useless, too tinny, but for most users not shooting important video's or movies wont care.4: Battery life: The battery on the D7K lasts a very long time. Even shooting video and images it lasts a whole day. I carry 4 batteries when I go out. 2 in the camera (battery grip) and 2 spare. only had to change once. Quite amazing.5: large dials/buttons: I wear gloves. Constantly. Currently its freezing cold and often snowing/snow on the ground. Being able to use this camera in the cold with gloves is great. The cold does not stop this camera but it sure stops my hands so using gloves with fingers NOT cut out is a must. Big command dial and spaced out buttons makes it easy. Any fine tuning that needs to be done I just say to U1 or U2.All in all its a great camera. Mine has had all the paint worn off on the edges, chipping all over the front, the flash is broken after it went down a rocky hill bouncing about, and a small dent in the corner after it fell.... actually.... I dropped it.... from about 5 feet. Thing is, The camera still works perfect. Its nearing its lifespan (148,384 images) but still works great. still kicking. a true trooper.Its not with out some issues but they are small. Often when I shut off the camera, the top LCD still shows all the standard information and wont turn off (shows everything, not just image count) so I have to turn it off and on until it goes off. The camera is off when that happens, just the top LCD stays on. Wish they would fix that with a Firmware update but it seems Nikon is not really supporting it anymore specially since the D600 and 800 recently came out. Few issues with it dropping memory cards at random. Doesn't matter brand but certainly effects my PNY's the most. Id avoid them with this camera. Class 10 is a must.5/5 in my book. Any electronic device that can take such a heavy beating non stop for a year in bad weather and bad temps and keep doing what it was made too do is a winner.If you don't want a FX sensor (award winning images can easily be taken on cheap 100$ cameras, its all about the photographer not the camera) and don't want 60FPS video, This is Nikons best choice for you.

My first purchase with the camera was the kit with 18-105mm lens. After hundreds of shots, only about 15% of them were sharp. I thought the problem were the lens. So, I returned the kit and bought a D7000 body, along with Nikkor 105mm f/2.8G micro and 85mm f/1.8G prime lenses.After testing the new camera body with two new prime lenses, I discovered there was a serious back-focusing problem with the camera. The AF Fine Tuning feature in the camera is quite good. However, I needed to adjust -15 for the 105mm and -4 for the 85mm. Then again, the AF Fine Tuning does not solve all the focusing problems. Depending on the shooting distance, I would have to calibrate the AF again and again. So, the calibration is hit-and-miss.Having trusted Nikon for 30 years, I believed I just had a bad batch twice in a row and I should still have a good chance of getting a good copy. So, I returned the camera again got another copy a few days later. To my dismay, same serious back-focusing problem still exist in the new camera. Then I did some digging in Amazon review (paying attention to the negative ones this time) and Googled more discussion forums to see if I am not alone.  Sure enough, many people had reported the same problem dated back in July 2011.So, I returned the camera again and decided not to try another one.In all fairness, I like the features the camera offers. The body is very responsive. The AF accuracy with the LCD Live View is extremely high (though very slow). However, the Phase-Detect AF system is a complete disappointment.The best thing I got out of this experience is the knowledge I gained from testing AF and fine tuning it. So much information is available on Amazon and photo forums on this subject.  If you own a mid-range camera like D7000, you owe it to yourself to learn how to test and calibrate your camera with your lens collection. Based on my experience, having tried 3 copies without success, it's fair to me to give it a 1-star rating. A camera that cannot focus is not a usable camera on my book.  I will probably wait for the new Nikon cameras coming out this fall (if rumors are right).With this writing, I am hoping all the buyers of this camera (or any camera) thoroughly test their cameras AS SOON AS they receive them. Do not wait until 30 days pass and you have to send them back to Nikon for service. If you pay for a new precise instrument, you expect it to work out-of-box. I chose not to send a brand new camera to Nikon for calibration because it's brand new! Plus, some people have reported same focusing problem even AFTER Nikon service center told them their cameras have been repaired. I am glad I did not need to go through that.Hope this is helpful.

Have played with it for a brief 3 days and here are some additional info some of you might be interested in.I debated the kit lens (18-105) vs what I already had from D70 (18-70). The 18-70 is slightly faster, the 18-105 starts at 3.5 max open apperture, and quicks turns to 4.5 at 35mm equivalent. So that was a little bit of an issue I thought. But teh longer zoom range (105mm, which is more like 157mm with 1.5x DX factor) did provide an upgrade option without much weight (18-200 would have been better but is heavier, slightly more $$). But the super silent motor on the lens made it worth the upgrade - as for video taking, the slient motor does play a very useful role. It is just as sharp for a kit lens as you can get. My 18-70 didn't have VR. This one does and I think that is another positive if video shooting is important particularly if you are walking and recording video. So I justified myself with buying the kit lens. I already have the 50mm 1.8 (75mm with DX), for those portrait sessions. Might buy the 35mm 1.8 as my standard lens somepoint in the future.So my lens list would be:1. 35mm/1.8 for most indoor people/kid photo/video.2. 50mm/1.8 for portrait sessions.3. 18-105 (or 18-200) would be for travel/outdoors.The video:With kids around, video shooting is very important. And D7000 delivered that with great results actually - to my surprise. Videos are bright, audio is clear even with the built-in microphone. The kit lens aperture (3.5 max) didn't impact the video quality to be any dark - with ambient light, the quality was great.Photos with kit lens (18-105):The indoor photos came our very very colorful and bright - despite what I had thought of. I realized that D7000 was moving to ISO3200 (my max level under Auto config in the menu) to compensate for the low light. I was worried that ISO3200 would render the picture quality low - grainy. But I must admit - my jaws dropped when I saw that even at ISO3200, the quality is GREAT (16MP do help here), for most print situations (letter size or slightly more). I think, this is really where the D7000 shines the most compared to other prosumre DSLRs of today. I went ahead and changed the AUTO ISO setting to max of 1600, and teh results are still great with the kit lens. With my 50mm or 35mm 1.8 lens, I will move ISO to at most 400, and I am sure I will be more than happy.I will add in more comments as I play with it more.Just one line on the memory cards I am using:I bought two 8GB transcend Class10 SD cards and configured 'duplication' of all photos. So the 2nd card is used by D7000 as a backup (automatic copy). This is a great feature. So far, no issues or delays recording video or photos to these cards. These Class10 cards are not as fast as the SanDisk 30MB/s cards, but I don't see issues in my situations. Combined, they were much cheaper than the SanDisk equivalents.with 8GB at full resolution and FINE JPEG setting, I think the total photos one can take are in the 700-800 range (sorry don't have details in front of me at this time). The default on D7000 was full resolution and 'NORMAL' JPEG, which was yielding higher total photo capacity (1,100 I think).cheersPN", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "D7000 vs. D300", "Author": "B. Mitchell \"bem202\"", "ReviewID": "R8HDVHXEQD51V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the D300 to the D7000. I'll say at the onset that the D7000 represents a significant upgrade from the D300. The first thing that impressed me was the D7000's ability to focus in near darkness. I was astonished by this and wasn't expecting it. But the most impressive aspect of the camera is its dynamic range. Shots that would have been blown out on the D300 are not so on the D7000. This feature is reminiscent of film cameras. The other major benefit is the D7000's truer color rendering. This saves a lot of time in post processing. The D7000 is also whisper quiet. Of course, the build quality is much better on the D300 and for me, the ergonomics are better. I didn't think I'd appreciate the lighter camera body of the D7000, but after using it only once in the field, I like it. One pain in the neck is that it is easy to accidentally move the setting on the mode dial. Nikon should have designed it so that settings could be locked in place. I haven't gotten into video, so I'm not able to speak to it on the D7000.The D7000 won't make me a better photographer, per se, but it's nice to have better tools that save time and allow me to capture images that I couldn't have done with the D300. In a nutshell, the D7000 represents a paradigm shift in what a prosumer camera can achieve. If you're sitting on the fence and wondering if you should upgrade to the D7000, just do it.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - Questionable quality control from Nikon", "Author": "Anupam Trivedi \"Aviator\"", "ReviewID": "R1WUDIGOORB7BA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Firstly, I have to say that I am very impressed with Amazon's customer service.I have been buying from Amazon for several years, but never had to call customer service or return anything until my D7000 purchase.  I am very impressed with the ease and transparency of the return process. This is what all online retailers should strive to achieve.Background - I've used a D90 with a Nikon 18-200 lens extensively, and found the results to be excellent.Now regarding the D7000.I purchased the D7000 body with a Nikon 18-200 lens.  As soon as I began to take pictures I noticed that the focus was a bit off and the colors seem to appear washed out and bland.  I tried the camera in bright sunlight, indoors - low light, room lighting, flash etc, nothing seemed to help.  I read the manual from cover to cover, and for the longest time, I assumed that I was doing something wrong.  For about 2 weeks, I systematically changed and reset various controls, sharpness settings,  white balance etc nothing seemed to help.  Finally began to search the online reviews and forums, and found that this seemed to be a problem with certain units and it seems that Nikon has been slipping on quality control.Incidentally, I came upon a Wolf Camera store while traveling through Sarasota FL and had a chance to speak with the sales people and play with the display until in the shop.  I immediately realized that I had a bad until, and my experience was not necessarily a problem with D7000 model in general.I returned bad D7000 to Amazon and purchased another D7000.  This second unit performs flawlessly.  I am very impressed with the camera and features.

quality of the video is stellar. It's as though I have a $20,000 video camera that I can use around the house. The best part is being able to use depth of field to create truly cinema-like movies.The audio sensitivity level on my D7000 had to be turned to LOW, however, otherwise all audio-- onboard thru external mics-- was distorted badly. This is easily adjusted using the LCD menu. Also, the focus takes a bit to do its job, which is a pain if you're trying to use autofocus to quickly adjust between different objects at varying distances from the camera. This is the only real complaint I have about shooting video with the D7000. However, if focus remains constant throughout the scene, you're fine.I highly recommend using an external mic. For the attached video to this review I used a Sennheiser ME66.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Compared to my D300s", "Author": "Ian Kaie Tseng", "ReviewID": "R1A87STGGFV4Q9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am \"sidegrading\" to this camera from a D300s.  Here are my thoughts after shooting both together for a couple of months.The worst thing about the D7000 are its more \"beginner friendly\" ergonomics. The mode wheel on the D7000 is too easy to turn accidentally. Everything besides A, S, M, U1 and U2 are a waste for me. This could have been the perfect camera if they only made the buttons exactly like a D300s. The live view switch is too easy to hit accidentally with your thumb, especially if you use the AF lock button a lot (like, if you use it to enable autofocus). Its also too easy to accidentally press the DOF Preview button next to the lens mount as your left hand wraps around the lens. I can't imagine why they moved that button from its spot on the higher end Nikons.The one true ergonomic advantage the D7000 has for me are its user modes. This is a HUGE advantage, as the more settings I have to change between shots, the more mistakes I make.  I set one of the user modes to manual with auto ISO and mixing ambient shots in with flash shots becomes a total breeze. The smaller size and weight of the D7000 had seemed like it would be a big advantage but it just doesn't feel that great in my hands. I might try the grip to help this. The weight difference between the two is small enough that I don't notice it much and prefer the D300s feel.I had been worried that the buffer on the D7000 would run out too easily.  I have never gotten into trouble with this and I shoot in 14 bit RAW.  The stuff I shoot (typical Dad stuff, some portraits, some landscapes and long exposures), doesn't really require any burst shots, though.The image quality seems to be about a stop and a half better than a D300s after processing RAW files via Lightroom 3.  I would pretty much never go above ISO 800 on the D300s.  On the D7000, I will gladly go to 1600 and will use 3200 about often as 800 on the D300s. This is a big deal to me because it seams I can go without a flash about 50% more often.The autofocus and metering are a bit better on the D7000, but not enough for me to really care.Manual focus on the D7000 is easier, as it gives you arrows in the viewfinder telling you which way to turn the focus ring.  D300s only gave you a dot for focus confirmation.  Manual focus in Live View seems a bit easier on the D7000. I am not sure why, but it feels slicker.  Maybe the screen is refreshing faster?  The LCDs have identical resolution, so this could be in my head also.I love that the D7000 can use a cheap IR remote.  The \"remote mode\" on the D7000 is still a bit of a mess, in that it disables your normal shutter button, but its worth not having to deal with fancy wireless shutter releases and their ridiculous screw-in cables.So in the end, I like the D7000 better.  Image quality and user modes really cinched it for me.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superior to the D90 AND D300s, fantastic camera", "Author": "Surgery100 \"ADJ\"", "ReviewID": "RZWTP2Q0TR66S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently have a D5000 (and believe me, I wouldn't change it for the world as a relatively light, simple dSLR) but I wanted a full body DX and the D7000 was well worth the wait.

I am very happy I chose this camera:  I am just an amateur, and always wanted a Nikon DSLR (this is my first) ... because I had very good experience with Nikon Film SLR's (I have a Nikon F4) and lenses.  Also, though I cannot speak for others, the issues referred to as \"1\" and \"2\" bellow do not bother me too much.1. It looks like now the price is right  - Cameta Camera sells over the Net, but also has a store in Amityville (Long Island) NY.2. The Feb 2011 issue of Popular Magazine tested and compared the Nikon D7000 with the Canon 60D.  The reviewers found that the 60D does a little better when it comes to noise suppression: \"... despite the extra megapixels, the 60D scored a Low or better rating from ISO 100 through ISO 800, and didn't reach an Unacceptable rating until ISO 6400, while the D7000 did so at ISO 3200\". With respect to autofocusing abilities,\"once we turned the lights down through EV 2 (think a dimly lit interior), the Canon took a stronger lead, focusing in 0.59 sec, versus the Nikon 0.76 sec\" ... the Canon managed to focus in just over 1 sec in the very dim light of EV -2, where the D7000 couldn't make it\".3. I do not wish to question the reviewer's findings, but, I ask: What lenses where used in the test, in other words, what, exactly where the experimental conditions ?  Where they identical, while only the bodies where different ?  I could autofocus the D7000 with a Nikkor 35mm/f1.8 in less than 1 sec in a very poorly lit room (sorry, I cannot quantitate ...).  By the way, while Nikon makes a 35mm/f1.8 lens, Canon makes s 35mm/f2, so ...4. My only real gripe with the D7000 vs the 60D is the absence of a movable LCD and the absence of 1080p/30fps, though I believe these features may be more useful when shooting video ... unless the sun light is reflects too much by the LCD ... but, I seldom shoot video.  Had I wanted a fast focusing DSLR for video, I would have chosen the Sony Alpha 55 (fixed semi-transparent mirror -> faster autofocus).5. I do not read Ken Rockwell's reviews as if they were a Gospel ... that must be trusted (taken \"ad literam\"), but I often find valuable informations on his website, which I corroborate with informations from other source, some in English, some in other languages.6. Some noticed the Nikon D7000 is equipped with a Sony IMX071 sensor.  True, but Panasonic (which makes its own sensors) uses Leica lenses ... A Nikon is still a Nikon, and Nikon lenses are Nikon lenses.*** Original Review 20 JAN 2011 ***I shall be brief, since lots of details are generously offered by other reviewers on Amazon and other websites.I recently bought the Nikon D7000 and two lenses.- The Nikon D7000 is an outstanding camera, it beats all Nikon DX's to date, including the Nikon D300s. IMO,in terms of design, features, ability to customize, and image quality it also beats many Canon DSLR's equipped with a sensor of about the same size.  Of course, Canon offers a rotating LCD and 18 MP, but I seldom use the LCD for composition, and 18 MP is not much different than 16.2 MP, right ?!  We should also remind ourselves that the Nikon APS-C (DX) sensor is slightly larger than the Canon APS-C sensor:  370 mm2 vs 329mm2 (864 mm2 is the area of \"a full-size\" sensor).  Nevertheless, Nikon still loses to Canon when it comes to Point-and-Shoot and Bridge cameras.- I tested my new D7000 with a prime lens, the Nikkor 35mm/f1.8 and with a zoom, the Nikkor 18-200mm.  I also tested the \"fill-in\" capabilities with two external Nikon SB units:  SB-400 and SB-600.  Image quality (wealth of details, sharpness, color rendition), performance, design, ergonomics, usability, fill-n flash - it's a pleasure to shoot with this camera.- I loaded one of the two compartments with a 16GB San Disk Class 10 for stills (more important when shooting in burst mode), and the other with a 16GB San Disk Class 6 for video (enough even when shooting HD).- Given the fact Nikon also comes with the excellent Nikkor Lenses, and also the best Flash system (the SB series), the Nikon D7000 offers excellent value for the price.  I have not shot video yet, only photos, and compared with the Nikon 300s with a 35mm/f1.8 and with the Canon 60D with 35mm/f2.0, both owned by friends of mine.- A long and very good in-depth review of the Nikon D7000 is available from the knowledgeable Ken Rockwell - see his website.- Just buy this camera NEW, when available from Amazon, or from a reputable store promoted by Amazon (not from \"these sellers\"), at the right price, $1199.95, i.e. $1200.  Buy it \"body-only\", and chose good lenses, because a good camera deserves good lenses.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buy this instead of D7100", "Author": "CausticLye", "ReviewID": "R6T7IBSF1YGB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't care what any review says.  I owned this and then traded up for the D7100.  Worst mistake.  The D7100 is grainy (yes yes, b/c they removed the anti-alias to make things sharper.  Grainy is NOT sharper, it's just grainy.).  The D7000 is smooth and beautiful.  I miss the D7000 every single day.  Easier to use too.  Better setup, better dials, better everything.  Sure the D7100 has better specs et al, but in real life the D7000 is fantastic.  I am a professional photographer.  I don't believe in spending $6000 dollars on a camera body because 5 years ago the D7000, for instance, would've cost $6000.  It's all a game to keep us buying new cameras every year.  The top camera 5 years ago used to shoot fashion is still just as good as it was 5 years ago.  And looking at fashion magazines now I don't say, my goodness the cameras they use are so much better!  Can't you just see how much better the photo is?  That's my rant.

I won't try to duplicate the level of detail that you can read in some of the excellent reviews that have already been posted (here, and on many other sites), but will try to summarize some of my experiences with the camera, as well as provide some of the most important information regarding the camera. I've been primarily shooting with the Nikon 18-200mm VR lens, but have also used the Nikon f/1.8 50mm prime, as well. So, my review here will be focused on those lenses, but it is useful to have this background as you read my comments.Getting straight to the nitty-gritty, and leaving extended explanations and comments until afterwards, and based on my actual use of this camera:Pros+ Ability to shoot at extremely high ISO levels with little noise (comparatively speaking) makes this a low-light shooter's dream+ Sophisticated 39-point focus system+ Good overall image quality in a wide range of shooting situations+ Good video quality that makes up for many of the deficiencies of previous Nikon models+ Huge feature set, with large number of customizable settings surpassed only by very expensive, professional cameras+ Excellent construction quality, with few, if any, squeaks and/or loose assembly parts+ Large set of \"mechanical\" controls, including switches, knobs, and assignable buttons which allow you to shoot without being required to dig through menus+ Optical viewfinder amongst the best you will see in the camera's price range+ LCD display at top of camera displaying current settings+ Built-in autofocusing mechanism allows for the widest range of compatibility with past and current Nikon lenses+ Extremely good battery life - I'm getting 400-500 shots on a single battery (no flash)+ Quick turn-on time; it's ready almost as soon as you flip the switch+ Excellent rear display that provides good resolution imaging and also provides an excellent setting display (each when activated)+ Dual-card SDXC memory slots which can be set for either simultaneous (i.e., duplicate) or consecutive (i.e., switches to card 2 when card 1 is full) writing+ Reasonable pricing, when you consider what you getCons- A bit heavy; this thing can wear you out after a few hours- Although many report a comfortable grip, the size of the camera could have been smaller (this is personal taste, however)- No articulated display screen (the lack of which really limits video taking, but for those of us who have for years used an articulated display for photography, it's a real shortcoming, and one that is not easy to work around - again, as it pertains to PHOTOGRAPHY, this is a very personal taste issue; for VIDEO, which this camera shoots quite well, it's a real shortcoming)- LiveView is still too slow to be really feasible (and can in no way match Sony's SLT cameras and some of their traditional SLRs, some of which focus instantaneously in LiveView; if you are looking for LiveView, I suggest you look elsewhere)- Power on/off flip switch feels somewhat mushy, with no clear click position for On\" (and its wild just how much this can bother me over time)- Battery charger design is too large, and does not have foldable prongs for the wall outlet (who at Nikon can overlook such simple, but important things as this?)- No built-in GPS (can't believe its not included at this price; it's an optional component)- Pricing is unlikely to come down in the near futureThere is no reason to try and deny it: the Nikon D7000 is, in many respects, an amazing camera. As I mentioned above, one of the areas in which I have been most impressed is the camera's ability to have it set way up to 2,400 ISO and even higher and then just be used to knock off good quality photos in very low light settings at noise levels that were typically associated with cameras shooting at 400 ISO. In a pinch, you can move the ISO way up to 6,400, and although at this point noise is a real factor, you can still get some shots that would have been impossible before. But even at modestly high ISO levels in the 2000's and 3000's level, you can take shots with little noise, and this is, where in my mind, the camera really stands out from many others (the camera uses the same Sony sensor used in Sony's SLT a55 camera, which may largely account for this capability).The camera feels tightly built and well constructed. Whether or not it is 100% magnesium construction underneath (you can read this debate in many online postings), the camera feels much more like a professional camera that a lower cost entry level model. The grip and design of the camera make holding the unit comfortable, although it is a bit on the large side (some people like the large size to help them hold the camera better). In addition, the camera is physically heavier than I would prefer, and I find myself dreading picking it up at times because I know its weight. This is, of course, multiplied when you add a lens like the Nikon VR 18-200mm that I am using, because, by that point, you have a pretty heavy set. But, as I say, this is a personal preference, and many people considering a purchase like this understand ahead of time (and accept) that this type of camera will be somewhat large and somewhat heavy.Image quality is very good. The camera is capable of producing extremely high quality images, given the right lens selection and the right technique. I say that sentence carefully, because it is really a mistake to think that you can purchase a D7000 kit and, based on the rave reviews, just knock off one great picture after the other. Many, many reviewers (both professional and lay) have confirmed that that kit lens sold with the D7000 is not up to a camera of this quality, and simply exposes the shortcomings of the lens in shots. This means that in order to take advantage of the D7000's capabilities, you really need to put a good lens on it. My choice of the Nikon VR II 18-200mm may not be that lens for that absolute best quality, due to compromises such a zoom lens makes to get such wide range coverage. However, putting a prime on the camera can allow the camera's characteristics really shine, and even using the 18-200mm is a huge step up from the kit (and offers you wide versatility). But, in addition, the proper technique must also be used to achieve optimal results.  One should use a working knowledge of photographic technique to get good images. Use a tripod - even a mini one - when you can. Always use the lens hood, especially when shooting outside. Use fast shutter speeds to keep images sharp. Increase aperture when shooting indoors to maintain sharpness. The camera tends to overexpose in bright light shooting, so reduce the exposure to -1/3 or even -2/3 for outdoor shooting. And on and on. The D7000 can put out great shots, but you can't overlook technique and expect it to rescue every shot without effort. You also need to experiment with normal/vivid settings, because these greatly affect the overall color and saturation of the images according to taste.One thing I feel needs to be mentioned is the image softness of the D7000. Many other reviewers have mentioned this (both arguing that such softness does, and then, does not, exist) but my own experience does indeed find that the D7000 images tend to be on the soft side. But that does not mean the photos are bad, or that this an unalterable outcome. There is in-camera sharpening that can be applied. Better still, one can shoot in RAW mode, and then use software tools to post process the images (using RAW mode can also address the overexposures that sometimes occur in bright light situations).  Even if shooting in standard jpg format, you can use image editing software and bring up thee sharpness quite well. But, in my own experience, the D7000 does tend to be a bit soft, and knowing this ahead of time can allow you to take steps to address this before you even shoot your first photo. Of course, if you have the budget for it, putting high quality prime lenses up front will really move image sharpness upward, but this is often a costly route for the lay photographer.In sum, I have found the Nikon D7000 to be an impressive camera that represents a next step in the evolution of SLR technology. It would have been nicer if it had been a bit smaller and lighter, and infinitely more enjoyable if an articulated screen had been employed, but these things are often in the realm of personal taste, and thus, are not fixed determinates of how one will like the camera. The D7000 can knock out great photos in low light conditions that you have previously given up on, and its slew of features and customizability will keep you busy for months learning it all. It's a shame the price won't be coming down in the near future, but it does not seem likely at this time.

I noticed the focus looked shifted back from the indicated focus point. Example: I set the focal spot on an eye and the really sharp focus was located several inches further back on the head.Fortunately, the D7000 has an AF \"calibration\" function that permits you to shift the AF focus either closer to or further away from the camera (+ or - 20 positions) on both a global basis for all lenses or for each lens individually. I executed some tests and sure enough, I had to do a \"-4, global\" to get the focal plane to align with the focal spot on both lenses.Now things are fine but I'm surprised that a higher level body like this required this adjustment.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice upgrade from a D90", "Author": "Diego Zamberlan", "ReviewID": "R1QR29FWH8ARPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to this camera from my Nikon D90.  From my perspective, the advantages are external microphone connector, slightly better low light performance, and more dedicated controls.  The viewfinder seems nicer too, but I've been using other cameras between the day I sold my D90 and the day I got this one, so I cannot be 100% sure.To be honest, the camera didn't \"wow\" me (like moving from the D40 to the D90 did) so If you have a D90, I don't think the upgrade is worth it - unless you need the external microphone, want to use some old non-cpu lenses, need 1080p video, or some other feature you can only get with this camera.That doesn't mean that the D7000 is a bad camera by any means, it does everything the D90 does, and more.  Between the time I sold the D90 and got the D7000 I used several other cameras, from advanced point and shots, to a Canon 7D.  My favorite is the D7000, I like off-camera jpgs better than any other brand, automatic white balance, auto focus accuracy, and exposure are the best I've seen.  I also got a SB-700, and I got better results from the D7000/SB-700 than from a Canon 50D/580EX III recently shoot a polo match, and I do not thing I got one picture out of focus, or with bad exposure.

I have only taken a couple hundred shots but what I have seen after comparing the 90 to the 7000 is the image quality is definitely better and it seems that not only is there a better sensor and processor but also because the camera settings can be adjusted easier and more accurately. For example, the auto white balance is much more accurate and the shutter speed up to 1/8000 along with the great high ISO abilities and the metering seems much more accurate as well. Auto focus is great but I had no complaints with the d90s auto focus.  The controls and the feel of the camera are pretty similar with the 7000 being a little heavier but for the most part the menus and buttons are also very similar with the 7000 being a little easier to adjust with a few nicely placed camera buttons added on. The tripod base plate from my D90 will not properly fit the 7000 but the 7000 and 90 are real close in size other then that. I have no doubt this cameras capabilities are much more than my skill and/or knowledge warrant at this time but I don't see that being a problem.

Turner", "ReviewID": "R1VXM6KN6YSP3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera - that's the bottom line for me.  I'm taking a big step up from my first digital camera, the Nikon D40 which my husband wanted so he could start digital photography, and I could not be happier with my choice.However, I think it would be a waste of money for any one not familiar with the adjustments we used to routinely make with 35mm SLR film cameras.  The D7000 can certainly function as a fine point and shoot.  But why spend almost twice as much on this over the lighter D3100 if you just want to point and shoot, and maybe edit with PhotoShop or some such?For me, it's worth the difference because I want the freedom to quickly and easily make adjustments such as setting aperature or shutter speed to freeze or blur action; adjust the white balance on the fly for what I want the image to be; adjust the autofocus field and metering to suit the particular situation; switch from single shot to continuous, etc.  The D7000 puts all that in menus and sub-menus like the inexpensive Nikons, but it also puts it out right on the camera body, available through just one button and the turn of a wheel.Also, this ended up being just about as inexpensive for me as the D3100 because I would not have been satisfied with the kit lens on the D3100 - and replacing it would have been more expensive than using all the wonderful Nikon lenses I have left from the film days - WHICH NOW ALL WORK BEAUTIFULLY ON THE D7000.  (Of course, I did get my D7000 for $1,199, not the current prices.)  The inexpensive Nikons keep down weight and cost by not including a focusing motor in the camera - you have to rely on one in the lens.  The D7000, like other top of the line Nikons, includes its own focus motor.  Nice little bonus with the D7000 is its treatment of my old A1 lenses.  I have some optically very good, and very fast, A1s.  With the D7000, I can program it to recognize them - with just the push of a button and turn of the wheel again.  All I had to do was assign a lens number to each of the lenses and provide the focal length and maximum aperture.  Now I can use them with no trouble, I just have to focus them as always.  And the switch to go from autofocus to manual focus on the old lenses, or an autofocus lens that can't effectively autofocus in the particular situation (like my autofocus trying to pick up a tiny hummingbird in the middle of a rose bush this morning) is conveniently located by the side of the lens where my left hand would be going any way to grab the focus ring for manual focus.This is one really sweet camera.  It will do whatever you want.  The controls are easy and simple to understand if you have the background in photography - or want to learn.As I said, I think people are wasting their money if they buy this just because it is the new, hot camera when it is really more than they need.  But, if you want to be able to control the camera settings, and do it quickly without having to mess around with the camera, this is great.NOTE, after reading other reviews.  Nikon DSLRs have never had great video, and this doesn't seem to be an exception - if you want a video camera, get something else.  As for complaint about the manual, I think it goes back to my comments about needing to have some SLR experience or being willing to learn.  I found the manual completely understandable - it generally even explained each function a couple of times if you read all the way through the several hundred pages of manual.  Best way I've ever found to deal with this is sit down with the manual and the camera and really work my way through every setting, button, and dial so I know what I have.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Loving it!", "Author": "Super slim", "ReviewID": "R1EJSUPJJYSQBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not planning to write a review for this camera, but after figuring out the menus and adjusting it to my liking, I just felt all tingly inside and wanted to express my joy.First of all, let me start off by saying I used to own a Canon 7D with Sigma 17-50mm lens. That was an amazing camera and had so much features that I miss compared to the d7000 (like the way it felt in my hands, well-thought-out button locations, and Canon's picture quality). But I sold it because I wanted to shoot Nikon again. (I wish I can have both!)Anyways, I bought the same lens, Sigma 17-50mm, for the D7000, and and after taking a couple hundreds shots and messing around with the menu, I can say this about the camera: 1. The metering system is excellent on the camera. All the shots I've taken so far has come out in good, natural looking colors. 2. The menu system is very flexible. The one thing that I felt that was missing when I started using it was the ability to easily adjust the ISO. You have to use both hands (press the ISO button and then rotate the dial) to change it. But after messing around with the menu, I found the \"Easy ISO\" function. It allows you to change the ISO just by rotating the front dial, located near where you place your index finger. This got me to like this camera even more because I constantly adjust the ISO and the EV to compensate for the conditions that I shoot in. And there are a ton of other customizable settings -you HAVE to play around with it.3. 6 Frames per second is good enough! The 8 fps on the Canon was noticeable faster, but I don't miss it at all because it does not affect the shutter speed.4. The ISO is amazing.My only gripes are the way the grip feels and the size. But that's probably because I miss the 7D a lot in this aspect.And to those who are choosing between this camera and the 7D, I would say flip a coin if money is not an issue because both has their pros and cons. Canon shooters would get mad at me for comparing this to the 7D, but it's true. Even Nikon shooters compare this to the D300s, which is in the same class as the 7d. The 7D has superior ergonomics and handling compare to the d7000, but the D7000 has better metering and and is better in contrasty situations.P.S.

Getting into DSLR was a joint decision between my father and I. He wanted a NIKON body so I chose the D7000, and boy am I glad I did. After reading many critical reviews I knew exactly why I wanted D7000. For those that are having a hard time deciding, (my other choices were the Canon 60d and Nikon D5100), here's JUST A FEW points as to why I made the decision to get the D7000.First, let's start off with why you might choose a lower model Nikon, or a comparable other brand like the Canon 60D, T3i, etc:- A cheaper model can save you a lot of $$$, leaving you more room to spend on glass and other accessories.- The Canon's I mentioned and the D5100 from Nikon have the tilt/swivel LCD displays.- Canon is better for video production, as it is more adjustable overall.- Arguably, Nikkor lenses and accessories cost more. Like I said, arguably, as any quality piece of glass is $$$.Now, why I decided to get the D7000:- The feature set and AF system make the extra money worthwhile.- I don't foresee myself actually needing the tilt screen to often. My buddies who shoot with tilt screens almost always have them in the regular position. Would I welcome it? Yes. Do I  need it? No.- Dual SD SLOTS! I thought I wouldn't care for this. It wasn't a part of my decision initially but when I got the camera I found that I love this feature. Two cards, with flexibility on  how the camera uses them.- U1, U2 custom user settings. Another thing I didn't particularly choose the camera for but once I used them they are golden.- Nikon High ISO performance (including the D5100) is top notch. Enough said.- The only video I will shoot is for cinematics. For this, the 24p 1080p is perfect, as real movies are shot in this format.- Best of all, is the BUILD!!!!! By build I mean everything about the build. Quality, materials, and LAYOUT of buttons and functions. I wasn't used to the layout intially as I \"practiced\" withCanon's a bunch before, but it is so easy and FLUID to use it really is awesome. Also, I absolutely love the DUAL DIALS (front and back) for adjustments. The clicky dials and singledial layouts leave something to be desired especially on the lower end models. (This of course is personal preference) The ALLOY body feels so planted and durable. It's also more weatherproof than the other camera's I mentioned.Basically, this is priced on the higher end of the Entry-Intermediate cameras, but for good reason. This is a \"PROSUMER\" product, and is for the serious enthusiast to semi-pro/pro.As a side note, for me it was gonna be the T3i over the D5100 (no full manual exposure on D5100 video) and the D7000 over 60D. After going to a store first to feel the D7000 and 60D it was over.The ONLY thing I was worried about was the back focusing issues people had. I worried for nothing, the focus on my kit lens and 50 1.8G are spot on. I shot a focus chart and the results were as expected. Maybe the firmware has something to do with it?

Everything is very professional, good materials, looks pro, feels pro.2) PHOTO, I always loved Nikon and I still prefer Nikon over other brands. They keep on improving.3) VIDEO, the HD quality is amazing, my only complain is that it has no 30 FPS in 1080p, only in 720p. I use it often in 24 FPS so I don't mind, but it's a flaw if you want to shoot content for TV in the highest quality/size. I hope they can upgrade it some day through firmware.4) It's a little HEAVY with the 18-200 lens, but it's ok for its size/functions. It's average.5) It's one of the few cameras in the market with a built-in INTERVALOMETER. A few days ago I was shooting a time lapse and it came out perfect, very easy to set from the menu.6) I love the TWO CARDS slot for back up. Very convenient. Or you can also use it for JPG + RAW.7) The TWO WHEELS system is fantastic and very customizable. For example, you can define that in (A)perture mode, you will use one wheel to set aperture (shutter speed comes automatically), and the second wheel to set ISO, or something else.8) It has many customizable functions in different buttons (virtual horizon, same use than the bubble in the tripods), a new button: preview the depth-of-field, etc.9) They compare it with the Canon 60D but I'd say it's comparable with the 7D. In some things the 7D is a step above, but in others the Nikon is way better.10) Lots of alternatives for metering and focus, combinations from a single spot to a 3D tracking, from one point of focus to 39 points. Depending on photo/video, what kind of scene, how many subjects and how fast they move, you have a bunch of combinations. Or just do it completely manual.It's a great alternative to Canon 60D/7D/5D for pro level HD movies. I compared it to the 7D for a long time, and I finally chose the D7000 for quality and similar functions, but much cheaper. The rest of the money just save it, buy audio stuff like the Zoom H4n @ $299, or put it in more lenses (like the new 50mm 1.8/G @ $219.

In general it seems like every setting is so customizeable that it's much easier to get images out of camera that I had to spend alot of time editing to get out of my olympus. The autofocus is wicked fast and the quality at ISO 6400 out of camera is the best i've ever seen for a mid range level camera.Heads up to the normal consumer without tons of pro movie making equipment and aspiration....Movie is nice to have sometimes; but if you're getting this just for movies of fast moving stuff like kids I think you'll find the continuous focus feature isn't up to the challenge and the rolling shutter issue is there like all DSLRs. You probably will get more useful in focus video out of some cheap consumer cameras (that have less depth of field) for that sort of thing. Note also the LCD screen doesn't tilt so if you like to hold the camera very low you might be dissapointed.For someone looking to get serious with their photography and who has had prior mediocre experiences with DSLRs (especially nikon) I think you'll be impressed. The hot pixel issue mentioned by some I haven't seen at all.As for megapixel comparison don't worry about it you won't notice a difference vs comparable cameras.Word of advice, the 18-105 kit is mediocre (was only way to pick up camera when I was looking) but if I were to do it over again I would go with the body only and get a 35 mm f1.8 prime as I think it's lighter and faster so more versatile most of the time.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sold a D300s to buy!", "Author": "Marc R.

It felt bulky and the video was just poor.  With nothing but FX lenses in my collection, I wanted a lightweight DX camera that I could just grab and go with one of my FX lenses on it.  After handling the D7000, I knew that it would easily replace the D300s without any loss in picture quality (a gain, instead) but with a loss of about 150 grams of dead weight.  The D7000 is, to me anyway, a lightweight camera that provides images that are nearly the same quality as I get from the D700.  Of course, the D700 is full-frame and that generally provides better and deeper image quality.  Nevertheless, when I compared pictures taken at the same focal length, same f=stop, same shutter speed, and same ISO using a D700 and a D7000, I had a hard time telling the difference from a small 100% crop from the image.  The extra 4 megapixels make a huge difference with Nikon's EXPEED 2 processor.  I've already placed in a few photo contests locally with pictures taken with the D7000.  The images are that high quality.In short, if you are deciding between a D300s and a D7000, the decision is a no-brainer.  The D300s isn't worth the price difference.

One Caveat (and Fix) for People Pictures.", "Author": "Macauley86", "ReviewID": "RY53YL6SAATS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this camera. If you are an enthusiast, this camera is a worthy upgrade from a D3100 or D5100; lots of buttons and dials for quick changes, two custom modes, tight and quiet shutter, viewfinder grid and virtual horizon, built-in flash commander mode, dual card slots, bright 100% viewfinder, and more. Love it. Love Nikon ergonomics.Only one problem that almost made me return it: skin tones were terrible, especially compared to the king of skin tones, my trusty Fuji S5 Pro. With the same lens (the Nikon 17-55), I took some raw and jpeg pictures (raw ones processed in Lightroom 4 and Dxo 7.5) and compared them to the raw and jpeg ones from the Fuji. The D7000 jpeg were shot in the Portrait and Standard picture modes. The Standard mode was downright wrong: too contrasty and saturated (I used it for a couple of shots, just to test it since it's the default one). The Portrait mode was also bad: skin tones were a horrid combination of green, orange, and yellow. No pink. This is where I almost returned the camera.Yet, I couldn't do it. I loved everything else about it. Did some online research and found out others were complaining about the same issue. One photographer recommended customizing the Neutral picture mode by shifting Hue to -1. That was good advice.After much testing with wife and children as test subjects, I came up with a custom picture mode that gives me skin tones that I like (don't tell anyone, but I might like them even better than the Fuji ones, well, almost. My non-photographer wife still likes the Fuji colors better).First, I use an ExpoImaging ExpoDisc 77mm Digital White Balance Filter - Neutral to get the perfect white balance for my jpegs (I also tried the Expodisc Portrait, but it's too warm for my taste). I know I could shoot raw and not have to worry about white balance for every shot, and I do shoot raw for income shots, but for family and friends shots, I shoot jpeg, and the Expodisc helps me nail the white balance every time (and it's really quick to set up on Nikon DSLRs). The Expodisc is expensive, but I'm a price maven and like to get my stuff used at a discount :-). You may also play with a cheaper alternative (ColorRight) or use auto white balance; the D7000 gets the white balance right most of the time, especially outdoor.Okay, so here it is.Custom Neutral picture mode (saved as Neutral1 because I have lots of imagination)::: +5 sharpening (D7000 is soft by default). This can be changed to +4 or +6 depending on taste;:: +1 saturation (D7000 skin tones are on the pale side by default);:: -1 hue:: -1 contrast:: ADL auto (some recommend switching ADL off, but I didn't notice any color shift in skin tones with ADL off):: EV (exposure compensation) either on 0 (indoor) or 0 to -3 (outdoor). D7000 tends to overexpose outdoor sometimes.Voil\u00e0. Now I get the skin tones I like. Try it out. See if it works for you.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow!

I own the Canon 5DMII, 7D, T3, xTi and several smaller point-and-shoots.  I had been wanting to try Nikon to have an educated review of Canon's biggest rival, Nikon.  I finally grabbed this model when it was briefly offered for under USD 997 on Black Friday.  I am very impressed so far.This camera compares best to my Canon 7D but I must say there are several things that are making me like this Nikon more.  It's lighter and smaller and fits my womanly hands better.  It has a screen protector already on it.  It focuses tact sharp most of the time.  The kit comes with a very well-written manual that covers all the areas.  And the USA warranty is better than anything Canon has ever offered.I am not one to say Canon is better or Nikon is better.  Both make excellent cameras and lenses.  Canon makes awesome \"L\" (for \"Luxury\") lenses and can't be beat at their lenses.  But for more popular telezoom lenses both companies are equal.  My Nikon D7000's images are clear, the colors are vibrant and it can take great photos in all lighting conditions.  The lens with this camera is good enough for someone new to Nikon.  There are ~TWO~ memory card slots rather than one, which is a great feature should one card fail, and all cards eventually fail.  The hardest part for me as a Canonite is learning the Nikon symbols.  Even the mount turns in the opposite of how the Canon mounts turn.And while my Canon 5DMII is still a better camera overall because of its sensor, full-frame capability and frames per second, I currently can't use it as it's at the Canon Factory Service Center under warranty repair.  What good is a camera when it needs quick repair within six months of purchase?  Canon's customer service and warranty repair are both mediocre at best.I highly recommend the Nikon D7000 for those interested in stepping up to a full dSLR camera.  The price is great, too.  When the price on this camera falls to below $1000 by next year, this will even be a better deal.

I spent at least a month researching and reading about both models.  Love the vari-angle LCD on the 5100, and i was almost married to that.  A photographer friend of the family recommended the D7000 and i began to be more and more interested in it, the more i learned about it.  The key differences in this camera really make it stand out as being more user friendly to an amateur photographer who is beyond the point & shoot level.  I realized what frustrated me most in my Canon point & shoot was how difficult and clunky it was to toggle around the in-camera menu system to change my exposure settings when shooting in Manual mode.  This camera makes adjusting your exposure a breeze.  The picture quality is impressive, and although i have only shot the above mentioned 2 Nikkor lenses with it so far, i am eagerly awaiting the opportunity to purchase a lens with a better zoom range, and put it to the test.  I am no expert or professional by any means; this is my first DSLR, and i can't express how glad i am that i went with this camera over it's cheaper counterpart.  I went to some big box stores and played with each model, which took awhile, because they were hard to find.  I would recommend picking it up and trying it in-store if you are unsure about which camera to purchase.  I finally purchased the d7000 after finding the cheapest price i could get online, without sacrificing vendor reliability (there were some very shady looking sites selling this camera for about the price of the D5100).  Battery life is great, picture quality is wonderful, and once you get accustomed to the menu system and get a feel for the button layout on the camera body, it's a joy to shoot with.  The heft/ weight of the camera feels nice and solid in the hand (i just couldn't get over how light and small and plastic-y the d5100 felt). I didn't purchase this camera for video use, so i don't have much to say on that subject, although i was quite happy with what video i have shot so far, (just casual short clips while on vacation).

Liles \"Big Daddy Bri\"", "ReviewID": "R2LXZLTVQRDRWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "From the moment I heard about this camera's release, I was very excited and immediately began the process of justifying its purchase. Once I was able to drop the $1200 all I could find was the kits and I really didn't want the lens that came with it so I waited. And waited. And waited some more. It took almost 3 months for me to find just the body, and I must admit that it was well worth the wait.From the get go, I noticed the mirror slap was much quieter than that of my D200 and I found it to be a pleasing sound. Definitely better for stealthier situations. It was also immediately apparent that the body was smaller than the D200 as well, but not so much so that I could feel a big difference while shooting. Another thing that I noticed was that the larger display was crystal clear and a nice upgrade. The general controls on the body were similar enough to the D200 that it didn't take me too long to figure most of them out, but there were a few options that I had to consult the manual to figure out; specifically, changing the flash mode and trying to figure out where the shutter release cable plugged into. The user menu is similar as well so I had little trouble setting up my normal shooting parameters.I was very pleased to see that the D7000 wasn't nearly the battery hog that the 200 is. I purchased a spare battery and the MBD11 \"multi-power\" battery pack and got roughly 3,000 frames from the first battery. That's over double what I would get from the D200 and the BP that accompanied it.There are a few other improvements over the D200 that I have noticed as well. The exposure metering seems more accurate and the AF motor is quieter too. I love the 16 MP images (twice that of my previous body) and despite my initial apprehensions, I even like the dual SDHC card slots though I wish I could still use my collection of CF cards. The auto white balance is HUGELY improved over the D200. I would usually do a custom WB for each lighting situation I would encounter. The D7000 has yet to be taken out of Auto WB mode and the results are more than acceptable.The noise at higher ISO settings is greatly reduced in comparison. I get more noise shooting with the D200 @ ISO 1600 than I do with the D7000 with the ISO @ 6400. And the fact that I can go to 6400 makes the camera all the better.Then there's the built in intervalometer which gives the D7000 the ability to automatically shoot one frame per second for up to 999 seconds. This is the feature that I was most excited to use and have used it a few times already. I am a huge fan of time lapse photography and now I have the ability to do TL projects. My only gripe is that the camera's internal software limits us to just 999 frames. That's only 16.25 minutes of shooting when taking one frame per second and when you make your movie (which is normally @ 24 frames per second) that works out to roughly 42 seconds of TL video per session.Speaking of video, that is another feature that I was very excited over and I am looking forward to using when opportunities arise. I have used the camera in video mode all of once in the past six weeks and I am not completely happy with the results. In all fairness though, I am sure that the issues I have with the videos shot are more from operator error than they are from the camera. I really need to read the section of the manual pertaining to the video capabilities before I say anything unflattering.As time goes on and I've had a chance to give the camera even more of a work out, I will make any necessary amendments to this review.Strengths:16 MPISO range from 100 to 6400 (25,600 on the \"H settings)6 FPSBuilt in intervalometerGreatly improved auto white balance100% View

applications where portability and covertness was concerned.  The DSLR has been a great addition and is ideal for outings and quick video grab shots.  Many people are using the Canon product but I had over 20K of Nikon Glass and really did not want to move to another system.  I am pleased with the results. the 1080/24 frame rate has not given me all that much problem, besides I shoot 720/30 most of the time anyway.  If you MUST have 1080/30 you will have to stick with the canon products.  Here is a quick 1 minute video I shot with it first time.... right out of the box in idiot mode... full auto!  [...]You will experience the jello effect if you shake the camera extremely fast while shooting video but this is to be expected with DSLR's... Just simply don't pan fast or shake the camera abruptly and you will get good footage!", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Much better than D5200 if you plan to move on with your photography", "Author": "Ayman", "ReviewID": "RTCMU07TYP99O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in this thanks giving, I had a very hard time comparing it to Nikon D5200if you are reading this review then probably you are comparing them both as well, specially that D5300 is now released as well.first of all I have to say that all three cameras deliver extremely high quality images and work with same types of lenses.well, the D7000 is a really serious camera, the difference between the three cameras in the specs is known and you can easily find it on Nikon's website, but the real difference is in controls.the D7000 has less resolution, but that didn't matter to me, 16.1 mb is a huge resolution anyway ... of course 24 mb is better but 16.1 is really more than enough.the real advantages of this camera are:1- it has internal focus motor, which allows you to buy extremely cheap lenses, all nikkor lenses work with it, so you can buy used old lenses or AF lenses for half the price you will have to pay for an AF-S lens.2- it has a really professional body size and form factor. its magnesium alloy, that makes it durable and feels better in your hand.3- Controls, Controls, Controls.... simply this is the closest to a professional camera, you can finish all your photoshoot without using the monitor. you can change almost all settings without accessing the menu or wasting your time trying to find items in the extensive Nikon menu system4- it has two dials front and back , which allows you to control things much faster and easier.5- the top LCD ... its a really big plus, makes you know exactly what you want when you want it6- view finder, really much better than d5200 and d53007- the battery lasts for ever, I shot 700 Jpeg images and it still had 71% of its charge, with raw, it lasts for almost 800 shots.8- it has two storage slots, and that's really a great plus, this helps with storing jpeg in one and raw in the other or keeping a backupand much morecons: .... its a DX camera ... its not full frame, but its really close to the full frame qualitynotes:1- it comes with a screen protector2- it doesn't come with memory card so you will need to buy one separately, so you can start shooting once you receive the camera3- make sure that any case you will buy will be big enough for itbottom line, this is a serious camera, if you are buying it to shoot your dog, you probably would better get the d3200 or d 5200but if you are planning to advance in photography, I really recommend this camera, its really a great choice, I have it for three month now, and I already bought a couple more lenses and some filters and accessories and I'm loving what I get from it", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very solid camera! Easily one of the best in class.", "Author": "Joseph Correa", "ReviewID": "R3A6ZJDTGA0KL4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned my d7000 for just under one year (Purchased, 1/2013) and absolutely love it! As the lifetime owner of several Canon camera's I felt the need to go outside the line despite the fact that I had invested heavily in Canon glass and accessories.  I looked at several options, the Sony A77, the Sony A99 (Full Frame), the Nikon D800, and the Nikon D600 all of which were perfectly capable camera's. I did extensive research reading written reviews as well as watching video reviews paying close attention to how the camera's stack up against one another in an attempt to help narrow my search. Second, I decided to take a trip to the local camera shops so that I could physically hold each camera and get a feel for them individually.  I really liked the Sony line because I felt they offered the biggest bang for the buck. My only problem was that I was not sold on the electronic viewfinder and less than desirable battery life that accompanied that particular technology. I resumed my search and although I did like the full frame options from Nikon I didn't want to plunge into the new system head first. This is when I came across the D7000 and really never looked back. All the reviews were positive and this camera had a lot to offer for the dollar. Solid construction, dual memory card slots, wide lens selection, and extremely good image quality. These are just a few of the tricks up this camera's sleeve!  Within a few days of holding this camera and debating I decided to purchase the camera (Body Only) and order the 35mm 1.8 separate with a battery grip and speed light. I have since added several more lenses to the arsenal and couldn't be happier with my choice. The color this camera render's (particularly when shooting raw) is nothing short of astonishing! I use this camera in a multitude of shooting scenario's and it handles like a champion. I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a professional grade camera that they can grow with. It suitable for use by Advanced Beginner's through Professionals. This is one of the best camera's you can buy in this price range hands down.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "If you're thinking about it buy it.", "Author": "M. Grosser", "ReviewID": "R2ZK5EUJKCF027", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Nikon DSLR user for about 6 years now. I've used pretty much all of the pro-sumer and semi-pro DSLRs Nikon has released, and I have to say this one is the best yet. The D300 will get you some extra ruggedness and some extra buffer space if you're a sports photographer, but in all other areas the D7000 has it beat.The low light performance on this camera is beyond excellent. I think that's probably one of the biggest factors to consider in purchasing this camera. I find it comfortably usable up to ISO 3200. Maybe stop 1t 1600 if you're planning to print very large and look at it very closely. In any case, this is the only crop sensor camera I know of that can perform this well in low light. A friend of mine has a Canon 5D MkII, and I feel the D7000 gives it a run for its money with regard to low light performance.Some people have complained about soft focus with this camera, but I can't replicate that. I'm guessing those people either got a body that needs adjustment by Nikon, need to have their lenses calibrated, or don't have a very good technique. Remember, this is 16MP on an APS sensor. It's going to be very unforgiving of a wobbly posture on exposures below 1/125. What you might have been able to pull off handheld on your D80 or D90 you may not be able to do anymore without improving your technique. The pixel density makes a difference. Cheaper lenses will also produce worse results than they did on older bodies for the same reason. That said, don't worry about lenses like the 18-200mm VR II (it's gotten some scrutiny with the D7000), it works fine unless you're pixel peeping deeper than it's worth looking. This camera also has its own focus motor so you can use older (but still oustanding) lenses like the 85mm f/1.4D.In any case, this camera is a must buy for the pro-sumer or semi-pro. Definitely consider this even if you think the D300s is more appropriate. You might be surprised.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "D7000! Wow! Nice camera but  I can't get it away from my wife!", "Author": "GarageBoy", "ReviewID": "R30BSR3CLXY5WA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a preliminary review. I'm a pro photographer who has been faithfully served by Nikon D200 & D300's for event and nature photography. Just before a trip to the Everglades, my D300's lcd info panel light wouldn't turn off and it kept abnormally seeking the cf card resulting in quick battery drain. Of course the fix was having lots of batteries and turning it off when not shooting. But In panic assuming that the D300 was going to completely fail, I read Ken Rockwell's review and noticed the D7000's price. With time running out and not wanting to shell out $7K for the D3x (or D700 for other reasons) I somehow found one D7000 kit, but not body, offered by Amazon and could get it quickly. It was on b/o everywhere else I looked. I didn't want or need the lens, but what can you do sometimes?I haven't had time to evaluate image quality in detail, but it's impressive at least up to ISO 1600. Without the battery attachment it's small and light, but with good ergonomics. It's got most of the feature required for my shoots and tons of goodies if you're just a camera bug. Combined with the 18-200 VR it's a dynamite, relatively affordable package. It was easy to use without consulting the unusually well written manual. However, if you're used to the D300, etc., you won't be happy with the organization of the controls. The iso button's on the back left and the exposure options are set with a dial like on the D70, so you can't change the most important settings as easily. I don't like the new control for setting the focus options. But if you've never used a D200/D300 you probably won't care. The 6 fps is cool, but I'm used to 8 fps with the D300s battery pack. Those extra 2 fps sometimes mean getting the shot or not for sports/birds.Random remarks: So far, taking movies is easy and fun. Rockwell states that the quality isn't great, but they look excellent when shown on a large led hd tv. I have had no trouble focussing with my 200-400 or any other lens. I don't like it that you can't display both iso and frame count at the same time. The lcd info display on the top of the body seems fine, in contrast to criticisms by other. What I'm really upset about is that neither Nikon or Adobe have updated Camera Raw for phototshop CS4, so you can't use the D7000's NEF files with CS4. Maybe Nikon gets a cut from Adobe for CS4 - CS5 upgrades, which I purchased reluctantly. Nikon's ViewNX2 is good software and loads and displays raw files quickly, but I need to use psd files and, of course, photoshop's + plug-in's features to do real work.At this point, nothing much to contribute until I can get that camera back from my wife. (My D300 healed itself, I did lots of trouble shooting, but don't know why it started to work again.)  My recommendation is that if you can afford to shell out about $1.5 - $2K for the body/kit  (this price includes battery attachment, sd cards (too easy to lose!), decent case and camera strap [Nikon should get out of the strap business or contract with Tamrac.] buying the D7000's a no-brainer regardless of your expertise and experience.Update, 7/1/11: OK, upgrading to CS5 was worth it, sorry about the conspiracy theory. This is a great camera except that it's destroying my technique because it's so easy to use. With the 18-200 VR and the D7000's low noise at hi ISOs (but keep using Define2.0), I can shed 30 lbs of photo gear and my tripod. It's really fun taking videos and as stated above, the quality's great. And Scott Kelby, notwithstanding, the built-in flash ain't so bad either.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth the wait and upgrade.", "Author": "\u00ae", "ReviewID": "RATSBBXI4QPMV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the Nikon d40 for awhile and heard about the D7000 rumor early  2010.  I knew my next dslr would be the D90 or better.  What I wanted was the dual scroll wheels and 1980x1080p video recording features and this totally delivered.  Also a bump in megapixal and the new cmos sensor with better iso for low lighting would sweeten the deal.  I carried over the Nikon 18-200vr, 50mm 1.8 and 35mm 1.8 from my old D40.Photos:I been shooting this camera since the first week of November 2010 and have taken about 4000 shots/some movie clips.  At first I thought the image was a little soft.  The poster on this d7000 forum told me how to fixed it in the menu and all is fine now.  I am finally getting night shots, when I did night photo stroll with my friends the D40 was too slow and my iso skill back then wasn't great.  Since I gotten this I played with almost every buttons and setting and actually shot aperture priority now, I been using the Nikon present for the D40.Movies mode:I am still learning this, getting things to focus on the fly.  It does continuous autofocusing, but not as zippy as the Sony A33 I played with.  Overall the movies I made are fun, but in no way anything you see on blu-ray 1980x1080p.  I find that I do a better job of manual focus and it is much quieter.  I plug an external microphone to this and it really is a benefit to filming with audio for less background noise.Positives:+Great photos, Sony newest CMOS is good for low lighting.+Camera Body motor, I have a 50mm 1.8 that I can finally use.+ISO looks very good, once I leave 1600, I can notice some different+more external buttons, entry level camera like the D40 uses the submenu too much.+Bigger body and sturdier magnesium alloy material, I like that in my hands with the rubber insert.+LCD screen is much improved, now I do know if a shot is good or bad.+Live view photography, I don't use it much but I like the option too.+Nikon Service, I called about the stuck pixel in Movie mode, they said wait for the firmware, and it got fixed.+Nikon ViexNX is good for quick adjustment.+1080p 24fps Movie mode with continuous auto-focus(like I said not as zippy as Sony, but much quieter) I made a few youtube videos now.Neutral:Battery is bigger and more expensive then before.  I Since I record clip more it is hard to compare to the D40 which just took pictures.  I get 350-400 shots before I recharge.  Some people claim 1000 shots per charge, but that is not me.  My 4000shot hashas 5-6 charges already.Negative:-GPS, if the Sony A55 with the same cmos as this can have one for cheaper, why not the D7000.-I was hoping it be around $1000.  The Sony A33 and A55 are much cheaper, with the same cmos.Overall I like the pictures that I got from the D7000, and all the external layout.  I can bracket shots with ease, for HDR editing photoshop of course.  I don't have to go into the submenu to turn on the remote.  I even used the continuous burst for once.  The Nikon ViexNX is a good software for quick fix like for contrast and sharpening.  It is no way a Lightroom or Photoshop replacement, nope.  It can edit video too, but I just use the Window Media player on Win7.  I added the SB-700 to this camera and the two work well together, ie the wireless flash.

Probably the owner of the D60/40/3000 may also find something useful.A word about videoI don't care at all about video. Video is a completely useless feature for me. I only care about stills and this review completely disregards video capabilities and features. So please, keep that in mind for the bits where you will read things like \"better in every aspect\".Foundations of this reviewI'm keen amateur photographer. I put a great deal of effort, love, and attention into this craft and I consider myself a photographer -an amateur photographer but a photographer nonetheless. I have extensively used the D700, D7000, D90, D5000, D40, D60 and to a much lesser extent other bodies (such as Sony, Canon). Thus, I'm basing this review on actual and extensive experience with those cameras and from patient comparison of same-subject shots taken under same conditions.------------------------------------------------------------------------Why I bought this camera------------------------------------------------------------------------I decided to try this camera as it was a virtually risk-free exercise. A friend was travelling back to the US and I can sell it second hand at almost the same price in London. So, I decided to give it a go.The number 1 reason I considered this camera was because it offered micro-AF adjustment. I do a lot of low light shooting and shallow depth-of-field shots so AF accuracy is very, very important for me. Let me be clear about one thing: I don't have any problem whatsoever with the AF in the D90 with Nikkor lenses. I do however have problems with third-party lenses (see my review of the Sigma 24 f/1.8 for an example).The second reason why I decided to give this camera a try was the dynamic range. I love the colours and contrast offered by bright sunny days and sunsets as much as I hate white skies resulting from poor dynamic range.In all honesty, I didn't have any other reasons to justify this camera.I also knew that the extra 4MP would most likely render noisier images without any meaningful/observable increase in resolution.I also didn't care at all about the (partial) alloy frame, mild weather sealing, video, and the double card thing.------------------------------------------------------------------------Reality check: the distance between marketing and actual performance------------------------------------------------------------------------Let's start with the good.Remember what I told you about my reasons to try this camera? Yes, (1) Micro-AF adjustment, and (2) dynamic range. Well, let me tell you that it delivered in both counts.I'm very happy with the micro AF adjustment. I can now use third-party lenses without spending too much time manually focusing to get sharp images. Great. Excellent.Next: dynamic range. I knew the extra dynamic range would show up only at ISO 100, and it did. Fantastic. A clear 1 (1 1/3 I would say) extra stop which results in a meaningful, observable, and delightful, improvement in my landscape photography.If you just give me a D90 with those extra features (micro AF and expanded dynamic range) I would buy it in a heartbeatNow, let's move on to the rest...------------------------------------------------------------------------Noise------------------------------------------------------------------------Let's start with the elephant in the room that apparently nobody wants to see: the D7000 produces more noise than the D90 from ISO 200 to ISO 1600.It doesn't matter how you want to slice it: between ISO 200 and ISO 1600 the D90 delivers lower noise than the D7000.Am I surprised? Not at all; do I care? Yes, but not muchFrom ISO 3200 to ISO 6400 is the other way around. In particular, with the D90 my limit is ISO 1600, beyond that I have to put extra work and technique to get useable images; with the D7000 I can dare to go to ISO 3200 -and then put extra work and technique if I want to go beyond that.* Noise Vs the D700Let's be clear in one thing: the D7000 handles noise with decency from ISO 1600 to around ISO 4000. However, it does NOT come close to what the D700 can do. The D700 smokes the D7000 when it comes to low-light / high-ISO performance. These are two worlds apart.Really, don't kid yourself. For a lot of people the way the D7000 handles high-ISO noise is more than enough -but in no way is at the level of the D700.------------------------------------------------------------------------Dynamic range and colours------------------------------------------------------------------------* Dynamic range and colours at ISO 200 and aboveAt ISO 200 and above, the D90 delivers marginally better dynamic range and colours than the D7000. The difference is small, and most people will not notice it. Yet, the difference is there and plays in favour of the D90.When compared to the D700, well, things are different: The D700 captures colours and tones in a way the D7000 can only dream of. As for dynamic range, the D7000 still trumps the D700 up to ISO 300/400. Beyond that, again, the D700 smokes the D7000.------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall Image Quality------------------------------------------------------------------------This is the biggest issue.From ISO 200 to ISO 1600, the D90 delivers better image quality than the D7000. The D90 has better colours, less noise, often better dynamic range, and -very important- higher acuity.Please, pay attention to the last part: the D90 images have higher acuity than those from the D7000.Let me put it in other words: the D7000 produces SOFT images. I hate to break it to you because I was very surprised by that, but there is no doubt: the D7000 produces soft images.Above ISO 1600, the D7000 produces better images than the D90.What about the D700? Well, in this case things are very simple: the IQ you can get from ISO 200 and above is clearly, vastly, superior in the D700. The images are better both at low and high ISO -but it gets bigger as ISO increases.* ArtifactsIf you had asked me before, I would had said that is the other way around, but as it turns out, the RAW files in the D7000 offer significantly less latitude for post-processing than both the D700 and the D90. The key failure here is sharpening: there is very little latitude to get a natural look. Don't ask me why, but with the D7000 artifacts build up very quickly during sharpening. Lens aberrations are also harder to work with in the D7000 -again, don't ask me why.------------------------------------------------------------------------AF system------------------------------------------------------------------------The 11 focus points in the D90 are enough for me -heck, I have no problem with the 3 focus point in the D40. But having 39 focus points is a very, very nice addition. I don't complaint.However, the AF accuracy of the D7000 is really not what you expect. It's largely on par with that of the D90 -that is, nothing extraordinary.How does it compare to the AF in the D700? Well, the AF system is simply inferior to that in the D700.  There is a significant advantage for the D700 that really makes a difference in terms of performance.------------------------------------------------------------------------Build quality------------------------------------------------------------------------Lots of people got excited by the stronger frame and weather sealing. I have only played for a little while with a friends' D300s  and at the store, and I can tell you this: the D300s is a much stronger camera. Needless to say, the D7000 also pales against the D700.The truth is that after almost 50,000 shots with the D90 I never felt any disadvantage in terms of ruggedness or durability, and after several thousand shots with the D7000 I can't see much of a difference. Yes, I know is marginally stronger but I don't really see any advantage in that to be honest. I would trade the partial magnesium alloy frame for better image quality without thinking about it.------------------------------------------------------------------------Additional things------------------------------------------------------------------------There are a few things that I like in the D7000. I find the buttons layout and ergonomics to be very good. Also, the 100% viewfinder coverage is definitively a plus. And the live view system is significantly better than in both the D90 and D700.* ExposureOne thing that you may have read is that \"the D7000 overexposes\" -nonsense.First, it's your fault if you don't understand how the camera meters light. Second, any photographer worth his salt would make the exposure decision. The way I see it, whenever I read \"the D7000 overexposes\" I know that person doesn't think like a true photographer. And third, it's simply not true: the metering is very accurate and reliable. I usually select something else simply because I'm looking for something different than the average and because I already have in mind what I'm going to do with that shot (really, until you have figured out what you are going to do with the shot you can't really say that it is over or under exposed).========================================================================Conclusion========================================================================After taking thousands of pictures with the D7000, I have concluded that:* It produces soft images* For ISO 200-1600 the IQ is inferior to the D90* For (1600 > ISO <= 4000) the IQ is better than the D90* For any ISO above 200 the IQ is inferior to that of the D700* For ISO 100 the dynamic range is superb* It's not really a robust camera in terms of build quality (the D300s, D700  are)* The AF system is just average, on par with the D90 and well below the D700* The raw files are prone to develop artifacts very quicklyIn short, the D7000 doesn't have the best image quality, is not the strongest camera, and it doesn't have the best AF performance.Should you get a D7000? Well, that depends. Why do you want it? For the low-light performance? If so, wait a little more for a second hand D700. For the ruggedness? Get a D300. For the IQ (iso 200-1600)? Get a D90. For the AF? Get a D300 or above. For the dynamic range? Good reason, but remember that is only very good at ISO 100 and you still will have to deal with the softness of the image.I now have put my hopes in the D300s replacement. I do need the high dynamic range, but I put acuity, colours, noise performance, and AF accuracy before the extra dynamic range at ISO 100 any day. The new technology that Nikon has revealed in the J1/V1 hints to promising things for the upper-end DSLRs. But only using the yet-to-be-announced camera will tell if the better performance is actually there or just in the marketing brochures********************Feb 2012 UPDATE********************I've just sold my D7000.After spending a few more months with the D7000 I decided to sell it (the reasons are described in the review, nothing new here)The price of the D700 is coming down, so if you are interested in stills, go for the D700 and ditch the D7000.I may go for the D800, but I hope Nikon will release a camera with the D4 sensor and the D800 body.

As for metering, it DOES NOT overexpose!!! At least in RAW files, none of my RAW files have pure white pixels. But because in camera JPEG processor is not as smart as you, it can make overexposed JPEGs as a result.

There are now countless comparisons in the photo magazines and on the web that you can use to check out how it compares in features, so there's little merit in repeating them here. It's certainly an \"enthusiast\" spec so for a starter camera it is probably more than you will need to pay. Camera manufacturers don't make it easy as each are backing slightly different technology horses - and at the end of the day (which coincidently is a time when this camera is particularly good due to it's ability to handle low light with remarkably little noise) it's a matter of personal preference which manufacturer you favour. I find Nikons fit better in the hand than Canon or Pentax cameras - so head to your camera petting zoo to see which one fits best for you. I also find the controls more intuitive with the two wheel system. I also prefer Nikon's colour performance particularly compared with Canon's more saturated colour rendition, but since you will probably use some PC processing, this is not a deal breaker. If you believe the mark of quality is in resolution, you can get more Mps with a Canon 550d- but at 16.2 Mp this is more than adequate for the amateur and prints at least A3 sized with no problem or loss of clarity. And the quality is down as much to the quality of processor as to the number of pixels per se. If you have a heap of Canon (or other) lenses though, then it's probably not great enough to warrant the cost of changing horses in midstream as Nikon lenses house the autofocus on the lenses rather than in the body as Canon does.If you are coming at it afresh though, you are really looking at this against the Canon EOS 60D or the Pentax K-5 (although you can argue until the cows come home which the competitors really are. It's an upgrade on the Nikon D90 as well and certainly on any lower Nikons, and price wise, the Canon 550d might be in the same bracket).Where the D7000 is arguably weaker is in the fact that the rear screen is fixed while many competitors allow angled versions. If you are planning on life as a Paparazzo, then this may be an issue but for me this tends to be more useful for movie filming. Which brings me to a second slight weakness - while the HD video is excellent on the D7000 my unit had a few dead pixels (only apparent in video) but there is now a Firmware update that has reduced this, not totally, but certainly to more than acceptable levels on my unit. But I don't film video that often so this isn't a concern. I've also tended to prefer the shutter release firmness on Nikons, and here it is OK but a bit mushier (technical term that!) than on the D90 for example.In almost every other respect, this is a cracking camera. I love the duel card system that lets you save stills and video to different cards, or acts as a simple additional storage or for me, the best option allows you to save as both RAW and jpeg versions (incidentally, Adobe has now added D7000's RAW to it's list - but you will have to download that separately to even the latest Photoshop versions).The D7000 offers up to 39 AF points - which really is superb in this price bracket and which helps to generate superb image quality. The camera's low light performance is superb; even at ISO 12 800 it's just about acceptable. The build quality is fantastic and, while it tends to concentrate on doing the basics well, it has some nice features like low noise shutter options. The burst rate of 6fps is also pretty decent.It's a cracking bit of kit and more similar to Nikon's semi-pro D300S than the lower ranges but at an enthusiast price band (albeit that as a new product the pricing is still a bit toppish but will undoubtedly come down in time ...... if you can resist that long though). But for all it's cleverness, you can pretty much operate it out of the box as a very over-priced point an shoot, if that's what you want to do (but why would you?)It's not faultless (as explained) but it's certainly an excellent choice and you are unlikely to be disappointed. Is it good enough to swop bodies from a competitor? Well, that depends on how much kit you have invested in, but as a Nikon upgrade, it's a no-brainer. It's a joy to use and you'll love it - then when you process your pictures, you will smile smuggly to yourself at your choice all over again.Also, the kit lens (which are always pretty ropey) is surprisingly decent here too.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "This camera is great for pros and consumers!", "Author": "Bryan Huff", "ReviewID": "R3K16QI7U006ZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a backup for my d700.

I did and I have not regretted it.This camera is similar to the D-90 but has a lot of new and better features than the D-90. The most important features for me are:16 Mega pixelsI take quite a lot of photos and submit them to stock photo companies. The increased resolution allows me to crop pictures and still get a hi-res outcome. It has the second highest resolution (at the moment) of all Nikons except the D3X.2 memory cardsThis is one of the best things about this camera and only seen in the most expensive Nikons at the moment. It is a priceless feature that allows me to record my pictures on a backup memory card in case one card goes bad. Have you ever had that happen to you? I have and it is frustrating loosing your work. This feature alone is worth getting this camera for.Super fast AF and overall performanceThe camera feels overall much faster than the D-90. I focuses faster, it works faster. And I love the shorter \"click\" from the shutter.Separate dial for shutter actionInstead of the cumbersome selection of single shot, continuous shooting etc using combinations of buttons it is now a dial.

Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1BFNSCGOAMMK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first DSLR was a D80 I purchased four years ago. The shutter went out a few weeks back but I had been planning to upgrade to the D7000 anyway so this just hurried things up. I bought the D7000 kit with the 18-105 lens but quickly sold that on Ebay.  There is nothing wrong with the 18-105 lens, but it would be a shame to keep that as your only or primary lens on such a fine camera.  It really belongs with more of an entry level DSLR such as the D3100.  Consider the 16-85, 35mm 1.8 prime, or 18-200.I was shooting with a Tamron 17-50 2.8 lens on the D80. For low light, it worked pretty well but greater than half the time I needed to use my SB-600 flash to capture my young kids doing what they do (move). The only downside to the Tamron, or combination of the Tamron with the D80, was that the images tended to be soft, especially when opened up. So I also upgraded my lens to the Nikkor 16-85. While this is a variable lens that maxes out at 3.5, it is amazingly sharp combined with the D7000. And the extra reach is great for getting better shots and also providing relatively shallow depth of field that otherwise would be lost with the slower aperture.The reason I mention the lens change is that I wouldn't have gone to a variable lens had it not been for the amazing ISO performance on the D7000. I am now shooting flashless at very fast shutter speeds. I usually shoot raw and process with Lightroom and I'm seeing amazing results at 800 ISO even when fully blown up (1:1). At ISO 1600, I can see minor noise but Lightroom 3's noise reduction easily eliminates it. 3200 certainly isn't noiseless but again, Lightroom can clean it up very well in most situations. My old D80 had more noise at 400 than the D7000 has at 1600; I'd say 800 on it was equivalent to 3200 on the D7000. I could see printing 1600 shots at smaller sizes with no need for software cleanup. So while my results are preliminary (3 weeks in), I am astonished at the ISO capabilities of this camera. I no longer have d700 envy and am glad I can get great dx lenses for under $700 as opposed to $1500 for fx. Perfect for enthusiasts like me!You've seen the stat that the D7000 can shoot 6 shots per second. The 6FPS shutter is in some ways overkill. But if you shoot HDR/Bracket shots in quick succession having such a rapid shutter can allow you to do so handheld. This is really only possible because of the high ISO capabilities enabling very fast shutter times. And for sporting events and the like, it's nice to have the ability to rapidly fire off shots.I have also noticed considerably improved metering and white balance on the D7000 compared to my old D80. Of the 350 or so shots I've taken, I am spending much less time adjusting lighting and white balance in Lightroom.As others have mentioned, the ergonomics/design of the camera are quite good and I really enjoy the many direct access shortcuts for adjusting everything from focus to flash to white balance and much more. The two custom settings are very easy to set and perfect for your two most common profiles (e.g. indoor portrait and outdoor landscape). The screen is beautiful and moving in and around even RAW files is very smooth and fast. I went with two 16GB SD class 10 Transcend cards and while I'm currently using the RAW 1 / JPEG 2 option, I plan to use the second as a backup card once I go to RAW only.I've only toyed with the video function but that was a part of my consideration since I dislike carrying two cameras, plus chargers and media, on family vacations. The tests I've done in 1080P have been very impressive, albeit large as you would expect. Auto-focusing while video recording is okay, as long as the background isn't too noisy or subjects too many. The biggest downside I have experienced is the built-in microphone picks up lots of auto focusing noise. I have not yet invested in an external mic but probably will need to.All in all I am very pleased with the D7000 and see no major shortcomings. It's not cheap, but you get a lot for your money if you are in the market for a prosumer class DSLR. For users who won't explore and use the MANY options and capabilities of this camera, I would recommend considering the 3100 at less than half the cost. For D70/80/90 users who are ready to step up big time in terms of performance, this is the upgrade you have been waiting for. Some will hold out for a D700 successor (D800 or whatever it ends up being called). I have no doubt it will be an amazing camera but cost wise, you're going to be looking at $2500+ for the body alone and pay roughly double for coverage equivalent lenses. So figure $4K just to get started. Too rich for my non-professional needs but certainly should be considered if your work or wants dictate that level of camera. And there maybe be a D300s replacement in the works too.

As I have not owned it until now, I wanted to share my thoughts on it in a more candid manner.  I was originally a Nikon shooter, first with a D80 and later the D90, but sold my D90 shortly before this camera came out because I was not impressed with the D90 and became curious about the Canon 60D, so I sold out of Nikon and bought into Canon for a while.  I have no brand loyalty, I was simply out to see which suited my style.  After shooting with the 60D for more than a year, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be, with both the camera and Canon's system.  This was no fault of Canon or the 60D, it is a great camera and a great system, but it just didn't handle the way my Nikons did.  I found myself having to think about the camera too much and my choice of glass left much to be desired, it was getting in the way of what I wanted to accomplish with it.  So I recently sold back out of Canon and into Nikon once more with this, the D7000 paired with the 85mm f/1.8G, and was quite impressed within the first few hours of using it.  I can't quite describe it other than to say that it just feels right.  After spending about an hour to set everything the way I want it, I instantly recollected how wonderful it was to shoot with the D80, which back in its day was an amazing camera.  The D90 in my opinion was a wasted design and probably did no one anymore good than the D80.  But the D7000 is altogether a different animal.  It does everything the D80 did, but faster and with a little more polish, an absolute joy to shoot.  ISO performance is just awesome.  I can shoot at ISO 1600-3200 with my 85 1.8G without a care for noise at all, and even 6400 looks okay.  It's there, don't get me wrong, but it isn't.  I can tell you that it looks a lot better than film does at ISO 800, with more dynamic range (and that's saying a lot).  The AF system is awesome as well.  39 points is overkill though.  I don't like AUTO AF because it chooses focus based on distance and with that many focus points, sometimes it will pick every point within the frame except the one you want.  I'm not always interested in focusing on whatever is closest to me so I set the AF drive to 9-point/AF-A and have found it to be the best way to use the AF on this camera, all 9 are cross-type AF points.  Essentially, it uses the center point as the primary, but allows the points around it to re-focus if you move the camera slightly, or if what you're shooting moves slightly.  It stays put though when you want it to.  6 frames per second is pretty trick and I like the Q-drive, it isn't silent but it's pretty quiet and automatically turns the beeper off when set.  I like it.  Two card slots are probably better than one but to be honest, I only use one.  It's cool that I can put two in though, for backup.  And lastly, the single most impressive feature of this camera by far (IMHO) is how it works with AI/s manual focus lenses, of which I have a few.  I set the non-cpu lens data for my Nikkor 55mm f/1.2, slapped it on, and not only will it tell you shutter speed AND the aperture value in A mode (which it writes to the EXIF), but the three-way focus indicator nails focus at f/1.2!  Sold.  That lens is impossible to focus without a split-image rangefinder or 10x zoom in live-view.  It's made of magic, I swear.I like this camera, it is definitely worth every penny and 5 stars.  The D7100 will be the evolution of the D7000, but do yourself a favor a wait one if you're trying to decide between it and this camera.  I suspect if you're reading this review at this point, you're probably trying to decide whether to get this or the D7100.  Get this one first and become proficient with it.  In a few months, the D7100 will sell for a grand or less and getting it will be like using this camera only more awesome.

I mainly wanted to upgrade so I could access the manual controls, as I was tired with just turning a dial and using preset modes that tended to over or under expose.-This camera's 6fps shooting is amazing, and never ceases to amaze me! I'll just push the shutter down for a few seconds just to hear the fun shutter sound(;-The video is great, but I don't really use video very much. I find the autofocus noisy with my 50mm f/1.8, so I tend to use manual focus when on video.-Even though it may not mean a lot coming from a 15 year old, this DSLR would be great for any skill level. The reaction time when changing any mode or setting is split second, and it never fails. I've never once had the whole camera just freeze up, resulting in me having to reset it by removing the battery, like my D3100. This really is a quality machine. It has a great design and fits great in your hands just like it should. Unless you're a 5 year old, the D3100 isn't exactly the greatest size for hands. (Though I'm still a fan of the D3100 of course)I recently dropped my D7000, about 2 weeks ago resulting in my kit lens being ruined and the camera body being cracked on the top left corner. This is when this camera showed me it was of real quality.The lens broke completely off of the mount,completely cracking the lens, and the camera body mount itself is still perfectly intact and nothing looks out of place. The little crack on the magnesium alloy body is just cosmetic, and I'll probably go over it with a little tad bit of black paint one day, as it's very minute and isn't worth sending into Nikon to get the whole piece replaced.My final opinion: DEFINITELY worth the extra $500-$700 from the D3100, if you want a more professional camera. It's a great quality DSLR, and is a great representation of Nikon's products.By The Way: The lens I bought to replace my kit lens is the Nikkor 50mm f/1.8. I HIGHLY recommend it and I'm still amazed by the low light quality. It's a great, capable lens.The focusing distance tends to annoy me. You can't get as close as you'd like, but for $120 bucks, you can't complain that much.My next lens will be the Nikkor 40mm f/2.8 Micro as it has macro capabilities, is a great middle focal length between the 35 and 50 f/1.8, and still has a low aperture!", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent photo, frustrating video, bad service", "Author": "Robert Ward \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "RHFRF70LQDBI3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:Performance in low light is superb.Build quality is as good as professional level DSLRs.Custom mode dial is very useful.Small changes in layout from D90 are great.Infrared thingy on the back makes using the remote easier.Cons:Video auto-focusing is a marketing gimmick and just does not work in real world situations. In addition, the mic picks up the AF sounds and it is very loud. You would have to use a mic off-camera. I even bought an on-camera directional mic, but it still picks up the sounds to the point of being useless. But the audio issue is a moot point really, as the video AF is of little use. Nikon should focus on competing with Canon for video market share by matching Canon's bitrate and framerate levels rather than by touting video AF. Pros don't use video AF anyway.!!! The lack of a recording indicator light on the front and little indication on the back means you will have no idea when the 20 minute recording limit is reached when using it on a tripod without someone behind the camera. If you are planning to use the D7000 to record family gatherings, you are going to be frustrated and disappointed. I actually missed the first laugh of my infant son because I thought it was recording, but it wasn't! A simple light and a beep when it is done seems like a complete no-brainer and I can't imagine why Nikon did not include this feature on this or the D7000.Included software is not very good. Okay, Nikon's software sucks. It is a complete mystery how they rationalize charging $200 for a half-baked remote capture application (Camera Control Pro), when Canon includes something better for free! I scratch my head a lot when thinking about Nikon's strategies.Check your camera for backfocusing before the return period ends! This is widely reported, but Nikon has not owned up to it. I had to send mine in for service for a severe backfocusing problem. The entire service experience ranks up there with my Worst Nightmare Experiences Ever. Nikon's Customer Service is bad, bad, bad- infamously so. I won't go into the details here, but let's just say I came very close to selling my Nikon gear at a loss to switch to Canon. But they just make such darn great cameras!Final Analysis:The best prosumer DSLR Nikon has ever made. It's class performance is second to none. Video looks great but is frustrating to use without an indicator light. Backfocusing problems should be checked for right away. If this is your first camera and you are considering the Nikon/Canon question, ask yourself how important customer service is to you.

This camera snaps the picture before I notice it focused. Takes some getting use too at first. I can say I love it from the first shots. I have researched this camera for a long time (6 months) before I got it. But it is worth the wait. I look forward to future wedding and portrait jobs. This camera and lens combo is great. If you are in the market for this level of camera and just need one that does this is your camera. There is very little hesitation from focus to snap so far. Even low light works great.

I have owned the D7000 for just about a year now and the best way I can some it up is simply; the more I use this camera the more I enjoy using it. It seems that every time I pick up the camera I learn somthing new that makes my photos come out better.  My first DSLR was the D3000 with the kit lens, I was told the D3000 was a great starter camera and would take some time to out grow. Well simply put after about three months with the D3000 I was bored and was tired of the slow AF, very grainy photos at medium to high ISO, cumbersome menu etc....I think you get the point.  When I first purschased the D7000, pulled it out of the box and tried to decipher the owners manual I was a little overwhelmed, However it made me take my time, read articles and get some dummy books for this camera. Over all it has really pushed me to be a better photographer.  I have taken steller photos with the kit lens of scenery, night shots and protraits and have no complaints so far (the only reason I get a bad shot is due to operator error). D7000 is much easier to change WB, ISO, Shutter speed,F stop, Metering and other functions on the fly (NOT THE CASE WITH THE D3000). Not to mention the 6 FPS, which is fun to have at your disposal, man I love this camera!  In conclusion:1.) After a year of using the D7000 I am still learning about the features and functions2.) Still enjoy using the camera as well as the photo's I take3.) Enjoy the Kit Lens  just purchased the 50mm F/1.8 D lens and MAN took my photos to  to a new level)If your wavering on whether or not to spend the money on this camera I PROMISE, you will not regret it. I regret being cheap and settling on the D3000 and wasting 400 bucks! Not to mention the D7000 is a well built camera with great weather sealing....

I own a D5000 and love it as a travel camera but wanted the direct controls that I experienced on my brother's D90. So I took the chance and bought the d7000. I smiled after taking the first few pictures. I loved the feel, the speed, the metering, especially for flash photography, the ease of use, the focus points (and accuracy) and the controls. I've taken over 2000 pic so far with very few problems. I love the options for saving raw files. I used compressed 12-bit most of the time but sometimes uncompressed 14-bit for semi-pro work. There are so many things I love about the camera, but I just don't have the time to get into all of them. I did not find the image quality a huge step above the D5000, but there is definitely more detail and dynamic range at ISO100 for the pixel peepers and I love the old 12 MP sensor on the D5000 anyway. By the way, I still have my d5000.For  those of you worried by the blogs; buy from a reputable dealer so that you can return easily.

I bought David Busch's (Engineering textbook) D7000 guide and after about 1200 shots am just beginning to scratch the surface of what this camera is capable of..  Many before me have written much better reviews with much better expanations on how great this camera really is so I won't go into that.I am a hobbyist with a pretty good eye for photograpy that used a D50 for 5 years or so and SLR film user since the early 80's.  Early last year I had the opportunity to start shoot at a local charity's events (12-13 per year), HS graduations at their adult high school and program graduations as well.  I also really enjoy landscape, macro, wildlife and vacation photography as well. The D50 was OK and worked pretty well in regular light but started to have a lot of problems that several local repair facilities and Nikon all said buy a new camera...  My choices were the Nikon D90, D300s and the D7000 and after loosing on an Ebay bid for a new D300s I decided to go for the D7000 from Amazon.... Best price, fast delivery and good support incase something goes wrong...  I intend to buy an additional four year warranty extension to support my photography as soon as I recover from sticker shock and get a few new lenses...I was a little intimidated by the vast ammount of functions that this camera offers but have found that if I am paitent and continue to learn one function at a time that I will have a great tool for a long time in the future... The fears I had about being too complicated to really learn, the strange over manipulated samples from Amazon's pics, FLICKR and several on line forums I belong to and the fear that I would only use about 35% of this camera's actual capabilities have been put to rest by David Busch's book...I have shot mostly in one of the four modes controlled by the dial so far and have loved them. (Auto, Program, Shutter and Aperature)  Even on Auto most of the pics have turned out better than the D50.  As I gain a better knowledge of the functions and light readings of this camera I will begin to step away from the mode dial and start to use more of my choices for ISO shutter and ap speed...  Don't get me wrong, not every pic has come out calling to be framed and put on my wall at home but I can assure both the novice and the intermediate shooter that you will not regret buying this camera... It will grow with you (and until you become a pro if that is your goal) satisfy your every photographic need...  I am happy that I can use my old lenses during the learning curve so that when I am ready I will be able to shell out some buck for the real \"Glass\" that Nikon makes.  These old lenses still are great for a lot of pic taking and will suffice for a time...The colors are great and actually really close to what the eye sees, I have been surprised time after time by the D7000 and how accurate and sharp the pics are even with Nikon kit lenses.  Since I really am not one of the so called artist style photographers but do believe that composition is very important in picture taking I have set the goal to do as little manipulation of the shots as possible.  With the old D50 it was pretty much manditory because the CCD was on its way out and when I had an event shoot often the camera (or the operator) was fooled by the types of lighting, a non TTL flash or a background that the camera didn't recognise a focal object and wouldn't get a clear focus on anything....  So far the only problem I have actually experienced withe the D7000 was getting it to pick a clear field of focus on a bunch of wild rice shoots with grain that was ready to be harvested...  Operator error not the camera...  I also understand that this is a universal problem with autofocus DSLR's...My advice is if you are willing to put in the work and really learn photography,,,,, Buy it...", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Nikon D7000", "Author": "James W.

There was dog races and frisbee catching, etc. It was an all day event so I took both my D300 and my D7000. The focus on the D7000 was amazing, the rate of in focus shots much higher than I expected, very, very few frames were out of focus (most of the out of focus shots was user error). During the dog race, the animals were running at top speed toward me, the D7000 and Sigma 70-200mm f2.8 OS lens kept up correct focus while firing at 6 fps. The thing that impressed me most was the exposures. Every one was right on, bright back lit to subjects in the shadows, it didn't matter, the D700 exposed the picture correctly. On the other hand, my D300 was not as accurate. I was constantly adjusting the D300's EV up and down to get the right shot. As for the D300 in focus rite, it missed more shots than the D7000. I put the D300 back in my camera bag and used the D7000 for the remainder of the day. I can't say enough about the focus system on the D7000. It's more accurate, and faster than any camera I've owned.I think I'm going to sell the D300 and save for the D400 when it's released, for I have a great camera to use until that time arrives.Update 02/06/2012 I sold my D300 today.

While I enjoyed those previous cameras, the D7000 is quite a leap forward. Of course it costs more, but you get a lot more camera. Things I like about the D7000: the build quality (magnesium alloy, nice & solid), the intuitive interface (lots of handy control buttons and dials), dual SD card slots, the crisp higher-res LCD screen, and most of all THE NEW SENSOR. The sensor is the real show stopper. Forget for a moment about the higher megapixel count; what's really exciting is the improved dynamic range and ISO performance of this sensor. The proof is in the pudding - I'm consistently getting better pictures out of this camera than out of my other gear.  I feel like all of my lenses just got significantly better (they didn't, of course, but my camera certainly did). The lowlight performance of the D7000 is outstanding. The camera rifles off an impressive 6 frames per second - noticeably faster than my D5000. Autofocus is excellent, with a whopping 39 focus points. I could go on... Nikon has simply delivered a top to bottom improvement in this class of camera.  The D7000 is more than a modest update; it's a significant advancement. I am absolutely delighted with its performance as a still camera. Complaints? Nikon is making strides in the video department, but still hasn't delivered a true hybrid still/video camera that is equally adept at both. While the D7000 is capable of capturing beautiful video images, the camera is sorely lacking in audio controls (to the point that the built in mic input port is of questionable utility - it's just tough to capture quality audio with this camera).

It's not quite up to D300/D700 performance, but in all but the dimmest light, it tracks quite well.  The color tracking, which incorporates info from the 2000 pixel meter, works a charm as long as you're not into the extremes of the color temp scale.The buffer is a bit small, but the speed at which is writes to the memory card actually compensates quite a bit.  I'd say it writes to the card 50% faster than my D700, with the fastest cards I have around (45mb/s UHS-I SD and 90mb/s CF).The shutter is incredibly quiet and there are things I can shoot with this that I wouldn't dare with the D700, because the mirror in the D700 is so bleedin loud.This may have the best APS-C sensor I've used.But at the end of the day, I'd really have trouble recommending this camera, simply because it took two repairs and months of testing/arguing with Nikon to get an appropriate fix.If it came to me the way it is today, without the hassle I've been through, I might give it a full five stars.  But if you take into consideration the entire package including Nikon's customer service, and the time I've spend fussing with missed/OOF shots and sending the thing off, I have to deduct at least two stars.I know enough to be able to diagnose the defects and was able to make images which demonstrated the issue for the repair department.  For the average customer who's not technically inclined or willing to deal with such a finicky piece of gear with manufacturing defects, it just isn't worth it.If your time is money, don't bother with this camera.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great, so far!", "Author": "Thomas D.

As my interest and abilities grew I decided that I had out grown the capabilities of the D3100 and have since stepped up to the D7000.  It is an excellent camera and will do everything that you want it to do.  The main reasons for upgrading were auto bracketing for HDR pictures (yes you can get this with the 5100/5200 also), the U1 and U2 modes for quickly switching back and forth between pre-set configurations, the additional auto focus points (from 11 to up to 39), continuous shooting speed (3 to 6 frames per second) and the D7000 has several more controls to make ease of shooting and changing settings on the fly much, much easier.I would suggest the same progression that I took if you're getting into photography.  If you don't know what aperture, shutter speed, depth of field and ISO are or how to use them together then in my opinion you don't need to spend the extra money to purchase the D7000/7100.  Buy the D3200 with the kit lens and if after several months you never venture off of the auto dial then the 3200 will be the very best investment you can make for capturing moments.  If you begin to venture to the other semi-manual and manual modes then you'll probably realize that you may want to upgrade one day.  You'll probably also realize that having a back up camera with a different lens will be a very big plus too and you'll have that in your 3100/3200.In summary: don't buy more than you need but when in need you absolutely can't go wrong with the 7000 or its new improved model the 7100 (currently $300 more).", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Say \"Quality\", or just say, \"Nikon\"", "Author": "Al Canales \"A Texan in California\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z6YI0O0UEWFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned Nikon cameras and lenses for just under fifty years, very little surprises me about Nikon. But the D7000 is truly amazing! It is my fourth Nikon digital camera (my D70 still works) and got it due to a price reduction through Amazon. I expected the D7000 to be good but was surprized beyond expectations! In spite of it's advanced technology, the learning curve for this camera was not too steep. It did help that I read up on it after I ordered it so I was at least familiar with it. Also, I checked Ken Rockwell's web site to see what he had to say about it (very positive). The D7000 practically thinks for itself! It's tempting to just set it on \"Auto\" and do everything from there. But I like to set the Aperture, Shutter Speed, etc myself and just have fun with it. I am NOT a professional so I shoot pictures for the sheer joy of it. One tiny reason that I decided to buy this camera even though I really didn't need it is that I have Nikon's SB-600 Speedlight. By setting the camera's flash control to \"Commander\", it gives me wireless TTL flash using the SB-600 (just like the D70). Having used Nikon film cameras for as long as I have, it means I have a few Nikkor lens sitting around. They can be used with the D7000, just let it know the lens information and you're all set.

Canon, Pentax, Sony, Olympus...they all have similar 'issues' and most of their prosumer or high-end cameras come with an in-camera option to address this, just like the one there is present in D7000. (They use different terminology though..Nikon calles it AF Fine tune; Canon/Sony - AF Micro Adjustment; Olympus - AF Focus Adjust; Pentax - AF Fine Adjustment etc). Also, I understood that there are a lot of kits available in the market to help this calibration/fine tuning (Datacolor SpyderlensCal for example). So, fine tuning looked like something that is not uncommon with pro-prosumer type camera bodies.I do not know whether this is to be seen/called as a 'problem' or not....Because this also could be viewed as having 'more control' over our gear, at some point. I did not face any back focus issue with my D5100 (or my Canon T2i), so, there indeed was a moment of frustration when I got a camera that looks somewhere else when I ask it to 'look there'.Personally, I find this as a pain than a problem because I had to fine tune two of my lenses (a 35mm 1.8 and a 16-85mm (both were bought used)...third one, a 55-300 mm auto focuses just fine without any fine tuning). So, should one stay away from D7000 because of this terrible back focus 'problem'? Nope... D7000 might back focus when paired with some lenses but at the same time, the camera comes with a built-in feature to address this concern. If that fails to resolve the issue, then,  ONLY then, it becomes a problem.There are more than enough blogs/videos related to 'how to do AF fine tuning' hence I am skipping 'how I fixed it'  part...but I would like to mention that checking/enabling the 'Focus Point' (that can be found under 'Disply Mode' in PLAYBACK MENU) before taking the fine tuning test shots makes it bit easy (because, at the time of playing it back,  it would show where exactly we had focused).A few things (among the many) I liked about D7000:1. Excellent, durable build quality2. Great picture quality3. More direct controls4. Brighter view finder with 100% coverage5. Long battery life6. Two memory card slots7. Decent video8. User control over fps (personal preference. I have one of the shakiest hands in the world and hence I often shoot more than one frame whenever I shoot critical shots. Many a time, 6fps is wasting memory by filling the card with similar shots, especially considering D7K's low buffer)What I did not like:1. Position of the ISO button (I wish it was on the top, just like my (wonderful) Canon T2i)2. Low buffer3. Plasticky LCD cover(It is to be noted that this is neither a beginner camera nor designed for people with no patience and hence one should not expect  great shooting experience straight out of the box with any lens attached to it. Being said that, if a beginner is patient, not intimidated by some extra buttons, ready to read the boring user manual (this is very important) and want to learn photography, then D7000 has everything one need to learn photography or even make a living).Overall, I am pretty happy that I bought this camera...Awesome camera.(Wish to give 4.5 stars but that is not possible hence giving 5 stars)", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera at a Great Price!", "Author": "Jacket Guy", "ReviewID": "R1RBPUMZL5NC6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now that the price has gone down to about $900 for the body, I can heartily say this camera is worth the money. I purchased this camera a year ago and paid the full $1,200 and I'm happy with it, but with the recent price cut, don't think twice about picking this up if you are considering it.Yes, the image quality will be much the same as the D3000 and D5000 series, but the D7000 is infinitely more satisfying to use. It handles better, it has 100% viewfinder coverage, a larger viewfinder magnification, easy access to necessary functions (ISO, White Balance, Image Quality, Metering Mode, Drive Mode, etc), customizable settings, a second command dial, a top lcd, a better build quality, and the list goes on and on.

All you are paying extra for is handling and operation. For me, it is worth it.Both the 18-105 and the 18-200 are terrific lenses. The 18-200 is significantly heavier, although not much bigger, but having the extra reach is nice. Better yet is the 35mm 1.8 DX lens.

I have been using a D2Xs--Nikon's last generation flagship body, which I paid more than $4,000 for a few years ago--as my primary body and a D70 as a backup/2nd body.  I purchased the D7000 figuring I would replace the D70 and continue shooting with the D2Xs as my primary body.  I was surprised to discover that the D7000 outperforms and outhandles the D2Xs in almost every way.The focusing system is extremely fast and a marked improvement over the anything else I have used.  It is still not psychic, of course, but it does a good job in full auto, and with 38 focus points from which to choose, it offers good flexibility for pinpointing a specific focus point almost anywhere in your image.Battery life is excellent for a non-professional body.  I shot 1,300 images with it one day last week.  I changed batteries preemptively.  The one with 1,300 images on it was still showing multiple bars remaining.Low light performance just blows me away.  I try to avoid going higher than ISO800 on the D2Xs due to inescapable noise.  I had assumed that the only way to get a meaningful improvement in low light performance would be to get a full-frame body, such as the D700 or D3, but this body represents a major improvement.  I can shoot at ISO 1600 and ISO 3200 with very pleasing results.  Yes, ISO 3200 or 6400 will display noticeable loss of detail and smearing if you are looking at an images pixel for pixel. But the overall usability of those images is still very good.  This is the first body that I have used at automatic ISO, since I can then set shutter and aperture as my application demands, and I can know that the camera can then pick the ISO and still produce spectacular images.The only meaningful drawbacks compared to a true professional body are 1) limited buffer for continuous shooting (but it still fires off several images in rapid-fire sequence), and 2) no built-in second shutter release for shooting vertically.  Yes, there are other differences, but most are not important for most folks.  For example, being able to get 1,500 images out of the D7000 battery versus maybe 2,500 out of the larger professional body batteries.  For the price point, this is quite remarkable.I have not used this for video work yet, but it has excellent capabilities and an external microphone jack.  I have seen plenty of samples online of beautiful video work done with this body.  If you plan to use it for video, plan to use a tripod and/or to spend some serious money on accessories to help handle this body smoothly.  DSLRs are virtually impossible to hold out from your body (far enough to watch the LCD live view display) steady for any length of time.Overall I am extremely pleased and amazed at the high end features for the price point.

While this lens is not the best Nikon has to offer it IS a step up from the kit lenses that came with my D40.  Ken Rockwell speaks very well to this lens as well.  I decided on getting the D7000 because it seriously updates the D90.  The D90 has been around for several years now while the D7000 is state of the art.I have been using the camera for about a month now and the results are superb.  MUCH better than my D40.  It is weightier, bigger, much more solid feeling in the hand and when the stutter clicks the sound is music (to my small mind at least).  The ISO and WB controls are super easy to set right from the back of the camera.

For me (actually for most people), 99% of my enlargments are 24\" x 30\" or smaller, D7000 is more than enough for the job. Nikon D800 is a camera that all of us want but very few of us truly need. I am glad I have all the extra time to reconsider my position. Besides the crazy 36MB and FX, D7000 is a more functional camera for everyday use.Welcome home, my dear D7K.

I've been shooting with it for almost 3 months and I love it! This is certainly a lot of camera for a beginner, and even can be overwhelming for someone that knows a bit or more about photography. The performance at high iso is very good considering, and is an improvement over the D90. The presence of AF tuning is a welcomed surprise. This camera is packed full of features at a great price. It is absolutely the best bang for the buck if your budget allows. That said, there are other worthy contenders and one doesn't have to purchase a camera of this cost or model level to make good photos. Remember, it's more about the glass you put on the camera and the person pushing the shutter. The body is just your tool to make it easier to take the photos you want.I have no complaints with my D7000 and consider it is an excellent upgrade if you are coming from an entry-level or older dSLR. If coming from an entry level model, you will gain nice features like 100% viewfinder, built-in focus motor, commander mode for off-camera flash control, a larger and better LCD, and access to more controls and settings at your finger tips rather than having to dig through menus or push combinations of buttons. If choosing between this or a D90, you really can't go wrong with either. If your budget allows, go for the D7000, but otherwise, go for the D90, use the difference to buy a nice lens, and enjoy taking photos.If just starting out, please just remember that it's not just the camera that is critical for taking photos. In fact, technique and lens are both in line for most important pieces of the puzzle in front of the camera. Take the time to learn and understand and don't necessarily blow your entire budget on a camera thinking it is the most important part. Save the difference and upgrade your lens or add a fast prime or flash to your bag.

I've got my own photography podcast (photographerandmodel.com/podcast) and website. I teach workshops along with my studio partners every month on model and studio photography.I've been using a Nikon camera since 1984. For the past couple of years that has been the D90, but I just purchased the D7000 and I'm in love. It is without a doubt the coolest camera I've ever owned. Let me count the ways.1) The video on this thing is stunning. I know, you probably aren't buying it for the video...or are you.  I bought the D90 hoping to play with video, but its video really kind of sucked. And it didn't have an audio in, which made the video almost useless. (You do realized half of the quality of video is the audio, right?)All those things have been fixed in the D7000. The quality of the video is stunning. Everything looks like a motion picture. Rich colors, great depth of field. It is awesome.Only nitpiks on the video, it is only 24 fps. That's fine for almost everything and contributes to the film like look, but it means you can't do really high quality slow motion.You have to set some settings before going into video mode, most notably white balance.Focusing is tough, but this is a function of everything DSLR where you are using the LCD to do focus manually. Auto focus kind of works, if you have a stationary target.2) Image quality is great for stills too. I shoot a lot in the studio and in lower natural light and this camera is Great. Putting a bunch of images into Lightroom, some shot with the D90 and some the D7000 and you see the difference in quality right away.I'm not one to say megapixels is everything, but with the same glass, the D7000's pictures are just sharper and cleaner.3) There is lots of control. And controls. Which is a blessing and a curse. You can do anything, but there is a lot to learn to take advantage of everything.

Can't take the repeated down time & missed priceless opportunity to shoot pics on special occasions. Nikon support said they only repair for replacement I have to contact their corporate customer service.

For a crop-sensor camera, Nikon is pushing the boundaries by including more features while maintaining great performance.  If a full-frame camera is out-of-reach or is not what you're looking for, the D7000 is the next best thing.  Great low-noise performance up to 1600 ISO; still really clean pictures.  You can still get good shots past 1600, but as expected the noise will start creeping in.  There's mirror lock-up for long exposures.  Intervalometer for time-lapses or star trails.  Weather-proof magnesium-alloy body feels great and let's you think about one less thing when shooting outdoors.  Solid yet compact body compared to the bulkier full-framed cameras; compact yet solid compared to plasticky entry-level cameras.  39 auto-focus points provide more than enough spots to place your subject exactly where you want.  Commander mode for off-camera flash.  AND it shoots 1080 HD video.You might say I'm just listing specs on the camera.  But that's the great thing about the Nikon D7000.  ALL of it is in one package.  Going through the process of selecting a camera, you do the meticulous research on everything that is available.  Slowly weed things out: budget, lens selection, features, customer reviews, sensor noise, etc.  I was teetering on the edge of the the Nikon D90, a tried and true mid-level camera, and the Canon T2i, the new mid-level camera with the HD video flair to it.  Then you go into the product comparison where you develop two checklists: the first checklist are all the requirements that your camera should have; the second checklist are all the features that you want, but could live without.

However I do have a good eye for clear pictures and colors. My friends and I have been Nikon users for past few years using D50, D200, and D70. Two of my friends bought D700 this summer and the results just blew me away and now I wanted one too. After spending countless hours on the internet and comparing sample pictures and reading reviews of D7000 and D700, I decided to give D7000 a chance and picked up the kit (just the body was not available) from a local Ritzcamera during the Thanksgiving weekend.So the Sunday of the tgiving weekend, my friend with D700 and I with my D7000 compared our two cameras side by side with same settings (apperture, WB, shutter, ISO, Fine quality, medium size, and other settings) and distance and took pics of a subject (a golden metal peacock with blue and green stones) to compare the results. We used a 35mm 1.8G on D7000 and a 50mm 1.4D lens on D700.The result - the pics on the \"camera screen\" for D7000 actually looked better than D700 \"camera screen\". On the D7000 screen the pics looked darker, sharper, and more clean. However, when we transferred the pics on the laptop then the D700 pics looked better. We compared pics on multiple ISO's from 1000 to 64000 and even H1. Each time we made sure the settings were identical. We compared pics at 100% size and D700 pics showed less noise at every ISO and were brighter and more natural in color. All the pics taken with ISO 6400 or higher were much better on D700. We took some face pics and D700 showed more details like skin pores and lip details whereas on D7000 the skin pores and lip details at 100% were not that great..kinda pixels breaking out. Even on the peacock the beak of the peacock was more clearly defined on D700 than the D7000. One thing we noticed that the golden, blue, and green shades on D700 were more vivid and were standing out more. Vice on D7000, the colors were there but didn't highlight as much. After playing with Irfanview software, I edited the saturation on D7000 pic and now the pic had more vividness than D7000. In a nutshell, I had to play with a software to bring more life to the pic.We also tested using the 'auto correct' (or something like that) feature on Irfanview software to see which pics from either of the two cameras require more editing. The result was that D700 required very little to none auto adjustment, whereas, the software corrected/edited almost all the D7000 pics.I am not sure if the larger CMOS sensor on D700 is the only thing that is making a big a difference in picture quality over D7000 or if Nikon hasn't declared any other details. Spec wise D7000 beats D700 on every other detail and D700 technology is 3years old so how come D700 is still delivering better pics than D7000? Is it just the sensor?All in all D700 is a better camera than D7000. But if you don't compare the two then D7000 is not bad. In my situation I have compared the two side by side so I know that I can get better quality pics with D700. So now I am going to return the D7000 and buy D700.The price difference is quiet a bit so for the price the D7000 is not bad, but if you can afford the difference then don't even think about D7000 and go for D700. But if you have a tight budget D7000 will make you happy too.The camera does feel solid, light, and overall great build quality. The menu options are almost identical to D700. Two card slots is a good thing, but really, how often does one run out of memory if you have a decent size card.The video quality at 1080 is great but you would need an external mic since the camera picks up the churning sound coming from the lens while it's trying to focus as you're making the video and it's quiet noticeable. The video feature does not replace the camcorder by any means. If you make long videos, you'll need a camcorder. This feature is rather useful in case where you don't have your camcorder with you and you need to make a quick short video. Also the autofocus feature sucks as it keeps on focusing in and out the moving subjects or as you move the camera.Hope this helps.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "amazing camera", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R3T0RH5KVQAYEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "we've had this camera for almost 2 years now and completely love it.  great clarity, easy to use (both for beginners and more advanced users).", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nikon D7000", "Author": "Joseph H.

Most DSLRs are limited to their individual processor speeds, and buffer sizes, and therefore, after five or six exposures, the camera \"locks-up\" temporarily, mis the tail end of a lot of action shots.But since most applications do not require full size (in this case 16-22 meg) files, the frame rate and buffer size of the D7000 is more than adequate to get 8-10 frames of medium size (9 meg) photos in one burst.  This is the first DSLR that I've ever owned that has every thing I would expect from a serious camera.  the two user programable settings allow the photographer to save setting that they go to frequently.  Most of my photography is done in daylight, or with strobes, but about a third is done under tungsten lighting. The program modes allow me to keep one dedicated to the custom balance I use for tungsten lighting situations.The two SD slots mean you almost never run out of room on your cards.The D7000 has the solid feel of a film camera.  Something, I have missed in other DSLR units.  Color rendering  in the shadow areas of the photos is frighteningly good at times.  There is a richness in low light, and with tungsten lighting that is REALLY great.I use this as a main, but I would not hesitate to use it as a back up to a pro model.

I have shot probably 15 or more different bodies with multiple light setups and lens combinations. So, what about the Nikon D7000 in mind warrants the title to this review....? Simply put, it's the most professional feeling and functioning \"pro-sumer\" camera I have laid my hands on.Let me break it down a bit:Body and Ergonomics: I have fairly large hands and like to grasp something solid when shooting. Nikon did not disappoint here making the body from Magnesium for sturdiness and heft, while also making it big enough for me to hold comfortably (Note: I still bought the Nikon MB-D11 as I like to shoot in portrait position often). All of the button and dials are convenient, tactile and well made. The 150k shutter rating also helps to solidify the toughness of this camera.  I can definitely see this camera putting up with many years of solid use and abuse.LCD: Yes, I gave the LCD it's own bullet point. MY GOD!!!! This thing is just too sharp! I know that you have probably read about the resolution of the screen above, but it just does not hit home until you start reviewing your shots on it. I have NEVER used a DSLR with a screen this crisp. Just believe me, it's amazing.AF: 39 points....What else is there to say? This thing tracks quickly and picks up the right points almost all of the time. I have no issues with any of the lenses that I am using (Note: Nikon lenses are generally always going to work better with the Nikon AF system, but there are Third party lenses that perform just fine).2 SD Card Slots: Talk about a GOD send!! This cam take 16.2 MPX JPEGS and who knows how large the RAWs can get. We need all the storage/redundancy we can get. The D7000 allows you to choose that in the settings. AWESOME!!!CLS: This is one of the major things that turned me over to Nikon. Their take on lighting is just so amazing and this camera uses all of the same functions that you would get on any of Nikon's top FX cameras. I love off-camera lighting and having the Nikon CLS system is second to NONE!High ISO: Ok, I know that the camera will go up to 6400 (or even 25800 equiv.), but what is usable? Well, that largely depends on the photographer and what he/she is shooting, but to be honest for me all the way up to 1600 is easily usable. I would even go so far as to say 3200 looks great for viewing online or even some print sizes. Really, this sensor will BLOW you away with how well it renders low light scenes and details.Well, what are the negatives you ask? I will say this much....This is NOT a beginners camera. When I hand it to my wife, she generally just stares blankly back at me and says, \"ok what do you want me to do now?\" There are so many features and functions to explore that I cannot even begin to describe them all nor have I even found them all yet. Needless to say, if you are looking for simple, this is not your camera.Also, this thing is not light at ALL!! If you are looking for compact and unobtrusive, look elsewhere.

Just the focus system alone takes some knowledge to get it working the way you want to when you want to. The high ISO is amazing and there are even better bodies out now, but I can still use ISO 6400 images for web(if I must). The focusing is fast and the body handles really well. Most controls are accessible without having to dig into the menus.If you're a complete newbie, I would skip this and get a D3200, D5200 or a D3100/D5100, all great cameras with great sensors and very user friendly.

One hell of a camera it is, I loved it. Later when D7000 came, I have been reading reviews and hearings from friends that it has lot of potential and significant upgrade over D90. After too much of thinking i decided to go for it. ordered it and made one day prime shipping coz I cant wait to hold this bad boy and shoot it to its potential. But to my disappointment, I dint feel it at all from the moment I took the first snap out of it. Soft images, Memory Card error (ordered brand new 2 memory cards with camera), washed out oily images on occassions. I wasn't feeling at all and I realised as I read in many reviews for few users, they recieved the faulty unit like mine. Amazon is awesome, they have excellent return policy. Leave all that, after too much of thinking when you finally get to hold the camera, you really wanted to have a faulty one and have to struggle through all that returning. I cant even exchange as this is in high demand and all ran out of stock in few days after I ordered this. I need to wait until stocks are loaded up again. Now I lost my interest in D7000 and made me think to wait for D400 (reading rumors but not sure). Nikon needs to do more robust QA on the products. I am not blaming the product but the company.When I get the perfect piece not the faulty one, I will re-write my review with updated points.UPDATE:Sad to give this update that still has not found defect free D7000 yet. After the original review I returned the camera and was looking for replacement but to my luck Amazon is out of stock. So got the refund and bought one from J & R. So unwrapped it and started firing away and learn many things that issues I noted above are not with faulty piece but with all the camera's.-  Washed out / Oily / over Exposed Images under bright conditions. In general this new sensor/processor is over exposing constantly all the time that it washes out details under bright condition. It was not the case with D90 (one beautiful camera it is, i sold it :(  ) ...I have to always look for this wash out situations and adjust exposure value 2 stops down or more- Memory Card Error. This was really annoying. Thought its defect with few pieces but its not. The new piece had the same problem. On trip, I set to shoot RAW on one card and jpeg on another. All general ppl shots suffice to be compressed jpeg, easy to share right off the trip. And RAW images are things which I do part of photography, like any landscape scenes etc., because of this error all my RAW and jpegs got mixed up in the secondary card.Later Nikon had released the latest firmware 1.3 and it had the fix for that.- On occassions still i see, soft images (be little careful and you can avoid this in many situation)there is setting in the camera for Shutter Release \"Release\" & \"Focus\".  What does \"Release\" priority do is, regardless of your object is in focus, it release the shutter. Useful for sports photography (they cant miss the moment, during continuous shots if camera is trying to Auto Focus, also it slows down 6 fps on such occassions.So camera comes with \"Release\" setting by default. Change it to \"Focus\" priority, no matter what until the desired object is in focus it doesnt release the shutter. So no chances for soft images.THE NEW QA DEFECT:Again I am returning this piece because it has hot/stuck pixel on my LCD screen (not on sensor). Once you notice, its really tough to ignore it from that moment. Its annoying though its tiny and tinier that this . dot. I can get used to live with it, caveat is it may develop more in the future and cant be acceptable for the price of the camera. i have tried all the ways to fix the hot pixel and not going away. I feel have NO LUCK with D7000.What I still love about the camera and want to hold it:- Colors ! Colors ! Colors! are simply real- Fast AF system.- Better User Settings.- Pictures just come alive and feels so great with lenses like 24-70 f2.8- Weightless and Ergonomically awesome.- Portraits are way to go !! after post processing ppl think I am a PRO and GOOD TO START my portrait business (but in real I am not that pro like)I wish I understand this camera more to work around the few defects .. or just work great like predecessors.

There are a couple of negatives I noticed right away. On the D90 in single point focus mode I could look at the top LCD display and see which one of the 11 sensors I was using. Then if I wanted to change it I could do so with out ever having to raise the camera up. On the D7000 the top LCD does not show this information, and you have to look at the rear display mode to find out. Another change I'm not happy about is the ISO-Auto feature, (this is not the same as Auto ISO). On the D90 I could add \"ISO Senitivity\" to \"My Menu\" and I had complete contol over the menu including the ISO-Auto feature. This is really handy when taking pictures at a show and the lighting is changing every second. On the D7000 I added ISO Sensitivity to \"My Menu\" but now I can only turn ISO-Auto on or off. On the D90 I could adjust the minimum and maxium ISO and shutter speeds, on the D7000 I can NOT. This is a major pain, b/c now I have to hunt down the menu item everytime I change lenses to adjust the minimum shutter speed. For professionals this might not be a big deal, they just switch cameras, but for the enthusized this camera is aimed at, it's a pain. Something else I noticed was that on the D90 I could change the recording folder name, but on the D7000 I can only change the folder number. For instance, on the D90 I could make a folder that said SHOW, GRAD, GTOR, etc, then when I went home I would know what pictures are in that folder. On the D7000 all I can do is change the folder from 100D7000 to 101D7000, 102D7000, 103D7000 etc. I'm sorry but 102D7000 doesn't tell me anything about what's in that folder. This might not be the correct place for it but the optional battery grip is also not as good as the D90's. On the D90 two batteries where in the grip and no batteries were in the actual camera itself. On the D7000's grip there is only one battery. On the D90 I could kill a battery, pop it out and put in a new one. This made it easy to rotate thru my batteries, now in order to remove the camera battery I have to completely remove the grip. I'm worried that one day I'll kill my grips battery and the camera battery will be dead too, b/c I was in a hurry and didn't have time to change it.There are not a lot of real positives that I see over the D90. True it has a 16MP sensor, 39 point autofocus system, expanded ISO range and a faster frame rate. Not to mention improved video capabilities, but I didn't buy this camera to shoot movies. These features aren't really that impressive. If my D90 hadn't died in a freak 6 year old accident (my son tried to take pictures of his goldfish up close and personal) I wouldn't have bought this camera. Don't get me wrong, it's a great camera and I'm sure I'll grow to love it in time, but if you already have a D90, I would hold on to it for now. Besides in about one year from now Nikon will probably be releasing an updated version(D7100??).", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Mindblowing. Superb.

Many of the casual shots I took on the D5000 were somewhat manual, but the D7000 does everything so perfectly that you can shoot in Auto and not feel a difference. The Auto-WB settings (keep warm) is an absolute favorite of mine, since I no longer have to fine-tune my WB into a step warmer than the environment.The pentamirror viewfinder is a lot brighter than the pentaprism mirror found on the D5000. And the rubber grip is solid. It feels right. I can confidently hold it vertically with just 1-finger below the rubber grip.Low light pictures are a joy. I can shoot upto ISO-1600 confidently, whereas it was only ISO-400 in the D5000 world.I have had no qualms shooting with the D7000 in rain, confident that the magnesium covering will keep the internals dry. And they did. I have had some bad spills over the camera (rain, sea water, some black tea), but nothing seems to have fazed it.The virtual horizon is a nice addition, making sure that I don't have to rely on my tripod's level to make sure that the horizon is horizontal.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bought it for the video capabilities", "Author": "Michael Strickland", "ReviewID": "RLZXZKCDWAOJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since purchasing my Nikon N70 many years ago, I've been a Nikon fan. I have stuck with Nikon because I already have Nikon lenses. To be honest, I've seen some amazing shots/video come from Canon cameras too. Really not sure there is a monster difference between the two. I see no sense in playing one against the other. As with all products, it comes down to what you are going to use it for or what you may have already invested in with regard to accessories, lenses, etc. I do own Canon video equipment (XH-A1) and  Letus Extreme (35mm adapter). I had been toying w/ the idea of moving to the Canon 7d so I could shoot stills/video with one unit. Lugging my Nikon D80 and my Canon XH-A1+the Letus gear all over for shoots was becoming more and more challenging. I literally was a couple of weeks from ordering the 7d when the D7000 announcement came out. I decided to wait. I'm glad I did.As the title indicates, I bought this primarily for the video capabilities. I shoot documentaries and nature-type films. I really wanted a full HD camera that allowed me to shoot 1080p w/ shallow DOF. With the D7000 I can shoot beautiful nature stills and capture some great video without changing equipment. I normally shoot 24fps since it is the the frame rate in full HD mode. But even the 720p @ 30fps is quite nice. The auto White Balance is amazing, but the presets can all be adjusted to your liking. The high-ISO settings are a blessing for shooting video. The HDMI output allows me to attach a 7\" Marshall LCD monitor for better focus and shot setup. I'm not getting any younger and for shooting video, I highly recommend it. I have a difficult time seeing the built in LCD screen in bright sunlight, making shot setup very, very difficult for my eyes. This is only a problem if I'm shooting video w/ Live View, not using the viewfinder for stills. My monitor is light enough to sit in the hotshoe without much difficulty. If you're planning on shooting videos, I suggest an HD monitor for outdoor work if your video shots don't require too much mobility. You can pick them up for a few hundred dollars.Complaints: Aside from the reflective built in LCD screen I mentioned above, the only real other complaint I have about the camera is that you cannot change aperture settings during Live View when shooting in Manual mode. You can adjust White Balance, ISO and shutter speed. But if you are shooting in Manual mode (which I do most of the time for video), aperture can only be changed in Live View in Aperture-Priority mode. That does make sense for Aperture-Priority shooters. And this may not be a big problem if you are not shooting on Manual. But it is annoying to me to have to leave Live View to make aperture changes, then go back and make other settings to get my exposure correct. Again, not a huge problem, just a something I thought Manual shooters might want to know.In terms of still photography, the D7000 is a nice step up from my old D80. The light body of the D7000 makes it less of a burden to carry around. I'm smaller guy with larger hands and this camera fits me well. All the buttons and settings are well placed and easy to reach without a lot of moving of my hands. For those new to Nikon or w/o Nikon glass, if you purchase the kit version, you'll receive the 18-105mm kit lens which is a little slower than I'd like, but not a bad all around lens.Note: One challenge I've had since changing to a video-capable DSLR is that subjects sometimes don't know you're shooting video. I've actually pointed my camera at folks and they stare into the lens waiting for the shutter to go off! :  This can create some interesting - if not unusable - footage as the faces on the subjects changes from a happy, nice smile to a \"hurry up and take the darn picture!\" look. This will change as people become more familiar with the capabilities of these cameras. For now it makes for sometimes funny, but often unusable video. I've actually started telling folks I'm shooting video when appropriate. That seems to help a little. :Overall I would say I'm in love with this camera. I've been using it for about a year now and I am absolutely thrilled with the images (both still and video) that it produces. I hope some day to get a full frame camera like the Cannon Mark 5d. Perhaps Nikon will make one w/ video in the next few years. For now, the D7000 perfectly suits what I bought it for. I couldn't ask for much more right now.  If you are looking for a DSLR w/ video capabilities you can't go wrong with the D7000 or the Canon 7d. Both are great cameras and produce great results.

The AF-S DX Nikkor 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR lens is perfect for all-around use, and I don't anticipate buying any other lenses for this camera.The D7000 is incredibly fast.  I'm getting shots that I used to get only with my Nikon film camera.  Closeups are sharp as a tack, landscapes are gorgeous with great color and detail, and I find I can get away without a flash most of the time, even indoors.  Start out with the Auto setting and let the camera do its stuff!  Then you can try the special modes in the Scenes setting for closeups, etc.Unlike most digital SLR cameras, the new D7000 allows you to use either the view finder OR to flick a switch to frame your photo and view it on the monitor before pressing the shutter.  If you are used to a point-and-shoot camera, you'll love this feature.  While the D7000 is of course heavier than a little point-and-shoot, it is not a large SLR and is very comfortable to hold.  The much better photos you will get with it will make the larger size and weight worthwhile, I promise!While the D7000 also has video capabilities, I rarely take videos and haven't tried that option yet.

This is very close to the D700 in low light and although I shoot in RAW for editing later it is great to be able to simultaneously shoot JPEGs, processed for a little saturation and sharpening in-camera and fire them off in email or post to the Web with zero other processing. This camera is head and shoulders above the D80 and D90; especially for low-light. I can shoot ISO 6400 and have very useable images. With some noise reduction in camera or post-processing they are really great and it allows that much more flexibility in low-light.Another thing I love about this camera is it gets the exposure right nearly every time! It's impressive. I often flipped from aperture priority to manual on the D80 to get it right. I can't believe the camera is so much lighter than the D700 either. I really love this thing. My most frequent setting which works for what I do much of the time is to aperture priority with the Auto-ISO set to ISO 100, shutter speed 1/125 and Max ISO 6400.I like that there is a custom menu, My Menu, for easy access to options I use all the time. I like that I can assign the Fn button to Picture Control and switch between Vivid and Portrait in under a second.With such a capable camera and with the HDR craze these days I am a little surprised it only does 3 shots for bracketing but 3-5 shots is all you really need. If you want 5 you have to do those other 2 manually. That is why I gave it 4 stars in performance. Otherwise I just love this thing.The HD video works well but you will hear that autofocus going unless you have an external mic or turn off autofocus/use a manual focus lens. I bought this for stills but the video is still handy once you remember you have that capability.There are probably 5 more things I love about this camera but can't recall without it in my hands. Anyhow, if you are on the fence. Jump off and get it. It's true the camera does not make the photographer but this one sure helps. Since upgrading from the D80 people tell me how much they like my photos and I think some of it is attributable to the warmness of portraits shot in the low-light this thing can do.

The build and feel of the camera is solid and the using the viewfinder is a delight. The video control buttons were improved and make it easier to use with less fiddling around. Having two SD cards is a treat, I use one for Video and overflow and the other for pictures. I loved all the buttons and settings on the D-90 but invariably I would put the camera down and then the next time I used it not remember that I had changed something -- now you can save your settings, two sets of them, so that you can start with known settings.

I find the light meter/color sensor in the D7000 to be far more well distributed across the exposure curve than previous cameras, and the D90 was very good.  The midtones are rendered well without boosting the picture controls and correspondingly less blowing out of highlights/color channels because of the boost.  IE just more accurate with greater ease of use.  This possibly is a result of the sensor itself having a little broader dynamic range also.  Anyway, the point is that this is a great picture making machine.  I like the feel of the camera, very BOSS, pro like.  I like the focus system control improvements immensely.  There is a learning curve, helps if you are a Nikon migrating, but this camera wants to be used by a PHOTOGRAPHER!  If that's you, this is A GREAT CAMERA.  (Sadly the full auto functions so well in combination with the focus system, light meter and the sensor that many point and shooters will be inclined to not learn how to drive the car, just put it on cruise control which is such a waste.)

I researched the crap out of many cameras in this category to include the Canon 7D, the new 60D, T3i and Nikon D700 and D90. My budget was around $1500 and I wanted the most bang for the buck.Weight:The D7000 is hefty with lense attached and this may be a turnoff for some. For me, the first time that i picked it up, I knew that I was holding on to something. The weight and construction feels like it could take quite a bit of abuse as compared to many of the Canon models which feel too light and less durable. For long excursions, the additional weight may become uncomfortable without a proper sling or pack - I can live with that. The magnesium body construction looks like it could take a bullet and still take great pictures.Construction:As stated above, this body is tough. Weather sealed for moisture and built to take some abuse.Ergonomics:For past/current Nikon users, the D7000 feels very familiar in your hands. Even though there are many new dials and buttons as compared to earlier models, with a little practice quick changes/adjustments will become second nature.Ease of Use:As stated in my title, all of the extra buttons, wheels and displays may be a little intimidating for entry-level/novice buyers. Especially one with moderate experience with point-and-shoots. But, even though this camera is loaded with features, many of the factory setting included by Nikon can take a lot of the guesswork out of initial picture taking. My 9 year-old daughter takes excellent pictures on \"Auto\". My wife even takes great pictures and she takes horrible pictures with everything else!Accessories/PortsThe twin memory card slots were a big selling feature with me. You can program the camera to utilize the slots individually. I have one card slot set up for only taking pictures and the other card for taking video. The camera does not come with a USB connector (mini-USB), mini-HMDI, or an external power cord/charger. The only way to charge the battery is to remove from camera and plug into supplied battery charging adapter (all setting are saved upon removal) - I used my battery for an entire 7-day cruise without recharging. For any of you with older Nikon SB-XX flashes, it will take a little fine tuning to get them to work with the camera - but they will work. I would recommend purchasing a Class 10 SD card if you plan on shooting any video.Pictures/video:This thing takes great pictures! Even though the megapixels (16.2 versus 18 for Canon 60D) may be a little lower than some of the other newer models, not a big deal. The viewfinder has 100% coverage of the subject area as compared to the Canon models which only offer 96% coverage. Even though this may seem like a miniscule amount, it could mean the difference between a poorly cropped photo or one suitable for framing. Video shooting is easier with this camera versus the Canon 60D because of control placement. Although the D7000 isn't the same as the D3x when it comes to low light shooting, it performs exceptional. Low light video shots suffer from slight pixelation though. The LCD screen is large and bright, but the addition of a fold out/swivel screen would have been nice.Included Lens:The included lense (when the package is bought - you can buy body only) compliments the body well. Color accuracy and exposure are pretty spot on with a decent amount of dynamic range. If you have the extra money, better glass is always worth the investment.FINAL VERDICT:The D7000 offers a lot of features, speed and technology for the price. If you have other Nikon D-SLRs, the lenses are interchangeable. Even my lenses from a much older n8008s work excellent with the new body.

If you use the $300 kit lens 18-105mm and wonder why your shots are soft it's probably a combination of your ability and your lens.I was debating on getting the D700 or the D7000. I am glad I got the D7000, the D700 is a better camera but its not worth DOUBLE the price for FX and 1 stop of improvement. This camera is the most advanced DSLR APS-C PERIOD. Canon touts more megapixels but Nikon rules in high ISO capabilities. I have taken shots with this camera at 10,000 ISO and they are not perfect (compared to a FX D700) but they are very usable. Where I feared using ISO 3200 on my D3100/D90/D5000 I don't even blink an eye when I need to go ISO 6400. I try not to shoot at extremely high ISOs but depending on the lens I am using sometimes you have to and knowing you can opens up a whole new advantage over other DSLRs.Comparing this to the D90 it is not a horizontal upgrade. This camera is better than the current D300s - the only thing it lacks is the slower fps 6 vs 8 on the D300s and the buffer is the achilles heel on this camera its limited to 100 photos and less in RAW since the files are huge.Everyone else has already touted the specs so I am not going to repeat what has already been said. This camera is the BEST DSLR APS-C PERIOD - buy it and if you do not like it return it with Amazon's hassle-free return policy. There is a reason it is sold out everywhere it's THAT GOOD and for the MONEY it's a STEAL for all the features it has.I am anxiously awaiting for the D800 and have my credit card open for when it comes out!

I think this is a great camera and have had no back-focus issues some have mentioned.When I was shopping for this camera I compared it to an APS-C Canon in the same price range (7D maybe?), and also compared it with the Olympus OM-D E-M5 and the Fuji X-Pro1, both of which seem to have great reputations.The Fuji was really, really, tempting but in the end I had read too many reviews on too many sites about strange focusing behavior and various other problems and quirks. The Fuji also lacked image-stabilization in the body or in any of the lenses available at the time. The Oly looked like a nice camera on paper but when I held it in my hands, it was a lot smaller than I expected and felt very light (I wanted a more solid feeling camera - just my preference). It also uses a micro 4/3 sensor which is noticeably smaller than the APS-C sensors used in the D7000 (and its corporate brethren). I don't know how much difference the smaller micro 4/3 sensor makes in real life, but it was just another nail in the coffin for the Oly for me.The other issue I had with the Oly and the Fuji is that the bodies are so small that a lot of functionality is done via menus, and I HATE menus on cameras. I had an old Canon F1 film body for a long, long time and really like it. Built like a tank, no electronic menus - everything was run via buttons and dials. More recently I had an Olympus E-20 ZLR and it, too, offers much of its functionality via buttons on the camera body. I have used plenty of cameras with all the settings buried under menus and just can't stand that. So any camera that is menu-intensive is out of the picture for me.I am the proverbial \"bull in china shop\" and am not as careful as I should be, so I needed a camera that would withstand me. The D7000 feels very solid and hefty and has a magnesium shell under the plastic exterior which helps make it more durable for people like me. The \"solid\" feeling reminds me a lot of the Nikon D300 (I've never owned one but have played around with a few at the local camera store) and the D300 is supposed to be a pro or semi-pro model.The D7000 has plenty of buttons - ISO, +/- exposure adjustment, shooting modes (P/A/S/M/scene modes), spot/center-weighted/matrix metering setting, DOF preview, and a function button to which you can assign just about any function you like. There are about fix or six buttons vertically oriented to the left of the LCD on the back of the camera.The viewfinder coverage is ~100% so pretty much what you see in the viewfinder is what you'll get in the final image - nothing is visible in the viewfinder that is cropped out in the final image and nothing outside of the viewfinder shows up in the final image.The cameras shoots RAW, JPG, and RAW + JPG. I've never shot RAW before and can definitely tell the difference between RAW and JPG but when manually editing RAW files in Lightoom, I have a hard time matching the quality of the JPG straight out of the camera. I'll probably still shoot RAW + JPG for special trips but shoot mostly JPG for less special events.The one bone I have to pick with the D7000 and Nikon is the infamous Nikon over-exposure issue. I had read about this before I bought the camera and so kind of knew I might run into it. I was shooting lots of pictures with blue sky and some with Lake Superior in the picture (either or both). I found that with any significant amount of water or blue sky in the picture, the D7000 is going to blow out the highlights at the metered setting. I used matrix metering to meter the scene in general, and I also used the spot meter to meter off of grass, rocks, pavement, etc. to get an approximate 18% gray metered value and still got blown (overexposed) highlights. If I'm shooting a scene that has grass, rocks, trees, flowers, etc. but no sky, the D7000 metered exposure is pretty much right on. What I found is that I have to set the the +/- exposure setting to -0.5 or -0.7 in most cases when overexposure is possible. This brings the highlights under control. I have the camera set to display flashing red color in the image playback to show me parts of the image that have clipped (seriously overexposed)  highlights and I have the histogram enabled too (it shows all three channels - R,G,B, plus luminosity) so I can see what channel(s) are clipping when I get flashing highlights on image playback. So an exposure adjustment of -0.7 or so usually tames the highlights.The camera also offers an Active D-Lighting feature which helps bring the shadows and highlights under control when enabled. I was shooting waterfalls in MN recently and some of the waterfalls are in shady areas and/or in deep gullies, yet some sky is in the picture too. I underexpose (according to the meter) to keep from blowing out the sky (i.e.. having the sky get be  so overexposed that it is completely white and washed out) and then use either the Normal or High setting of Active D-Lighting to expose the shadows more so I get nicely balanced exposures. I have found that for my purposes, Active D-Lighting set to Low or Extra High doesn't help much - Low doesn't increase the shadow exposure enough for the shady areas around the waterfalls and Extra High is a little too much of a good thing.Lightroom and Photoshop do NOT recognize Active D-Lightng in RAW files. All these are, really, are just flags in the RAW file that tell Nikon software to adjust the exposure curve. You can still accomplish this kind of thing in Photoshop and Lighroom by adjusting the curves and exposure manually and via masking, but if you want jpgs straight out of the camera that look good, I think Active D-Lighting and -0.7 stops of exposure adjustment work out great. I shot some waterfalls where the waterfall itself was in bright sunlight and there was sky visible above the waterfall, but the rest of the waterfall was in a ravine so the rocks and the area surrounding the water were in deep shadows and I was still able to get nice results using Active D-Lighting to increase the exposure of the shadow areas.There is also a D-Lighting adjustment on playback in the D7000 (similar to Active D-Lighting but you can apply it to photos already taken - I think it only works on RAW files, though). It will apply exposure curves like what Active D-Lighting does so you can post-process images in the camera if you like. It processes the RAW file and applies the exposure curves and saves the results as a jpg (the original RAW file is not modified). You can also do some basic processing of the RAW files in the camera as well. Not as good as Photoshop or Lightroom but pretty good for basic adjustments.The included software from Nikon for processing photos is pretty crummy and I'd recommend using Lightroom or Photoshop Elements instead.I wish Nikon would display the histogram in the viewfinder while I'm metering rather than after the fact in the playback. That would prevent me from making so many test shots to see if I got the exposure I wanted. I don't know if anyone in the industry does that right now. All the manufacturers seem to find it easier to display the histogram on playback for some reason.I have found that the auto-focus sometimes lies in low light. I was taking pictures of a building at night from a few feet away using a lens with a max aperture of f2.8. The camera would show that it had locked exposure but when I zoomed in on the picture in playback, it was clearly not sharp. Some of the pictures I took at that time focused OK and some were out of focus. I have read that digital cameras in general and this one in particular also can get confused in very low light shooting and tell you they have a focus lock when they do not. The solution to this problem for me was to switch to Live View mode, disable auto-focus in the camera body and on the lens, then zoom in on the LCD and manually focus the lens to get the subject sharply focused, then click the shutter button to take the picture. That worked much better. So be aware that as the sun gets really low in the sky or has actually set behind the horizon but there's still some light left, the D7000 auto-exposure may not work correctly. I always check my focus and exposure on playback after shooting just about every image. if you enlarge the image on the LCD in playback mode by about about 6-7 times (about one step short of where the image starts to break up into individual pixels), it's very easy to judge sharpness.You can also post-process your photos, in the camera, to get three varations on a sepia effect. I haven't tried it yet, but want to soon.Overall, I think this is a great camera. It beats any previous digital cameras I've had before. be aware of the over-exposure issue and be aware that auto-focus may show it is locked on in very low light when it really is not locked on.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "D7000 is GREAT", "Author": "Jonathan Pulford", "ReviewID": "R29Q5WA3PNRGFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my camera last night and played with it for a few hours.

Key issues are the following:(1) The 20-minute recording limit is a major limitation. This should be increased to the capacity of the card, or at least to 60 minutes.(2) The camera has several microphone sensitivity modes. One of these sets the level automatically, which would be very convenient if it worked. The problem with this mode is that the camera tends to set the sensitivity too high, producing saturation and distortion.(3) When one uses the internal microphone, there is a fairly high level of noise from the auto-focus.(4) When one uses a monaural external microphone, the camera should reproduce the input in both channels, but does not (one channel remains empty).(5) When using an external microphone and a mixing board to reproduce the signal in both channels, there is intermittent electrical noise. (The volume of the noise is high enough to impact the intelligibility of spoken audio, i.e., this is not just an issue for music recordings). I don't hear the noise if I plug headphones directly into the mixing board, and that same output is being fed to the camera, so it's fairly clear that the noise is being generated by the camera itself.To summarize, this is a great still camera, but not fully usable as a video camera.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "I Upgraded from Nikon D80", "Author": "A.

I've been doing weddings and bridals for about 5 yrs and loved my d80, it did everything I needed, so I thought.  After spending hours online comparing advantages and cost versus the D80, D300 and d7000 and the d700, I finally took the plunge and got the D7000 (I also do events and wanted the Hi ISO).  This camera is so much more than Higher ISO!  It is...Fast.For lack of a better word, Fast means everything happens so fast it makes shooting more intuitive.  The higher ISO has changed the way I shoot because I can turn off my sb-800 speedlight and just use natural light.  In the past, i wouldn't dream of attempting some indoor or evening shots without a flash and umbrella or other diffuser.  But now, low-light images are no longer a \"risky\" shot and they turn out beautiful every time.  (Yes, I rely first on good glass, from f/1.4 to 1.8 in primes and the $$$ lenses,  70-200 Vii 2.8 and 24-70 2.8).The change in how I shoot was more pronounced than I ever thought.  A few reviewers said the advantages were negligible, so i was pessimistic about trading in the d80.  After using the d80 as backup to the 7000 in the real world, i eventually had to sell it because switching between the two is SUCH a drag, it annoyed me, they shoot so differently.  (not to knock the d80, it WAS a great camera).If you are on the fence about the benefits of a DSLR body with fancier insides, just try it and you will feel the difference.

Foley \"coaster mike\"", "ReviewID": "R27CJ967VE1W7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D7000 is truly wonderful to use.  This camera is cram-packed full of performance and features that put it punching well above it's class.PERFORMANCE:The most impressive thing about the D7000 is image quality; incredibly high dynamic range and color depth create crisp, punchy images that pull out incredible detail in the darks and highlights. ISO performance is also a good selling point; this is argued by many, but I find the D7000 can create usable non-distracting images all the way up to ISO 5000, and below 3200 the images are fantastic. The new image processor in the D7000 is great at giving the images a film-like grain under high sensitivity and does a great job of curbing the noise. The new color metering system is generally very accurate and adapts well to changing light, though it often over-exposes by about a 1/3 stop in bright sunlight. The Autofocus is very customizable and overall is impressively quick, snappy, and accurate. The 39 focus point selection is easy to use and comes in handy when using variable selection. Set to subject tracking, the AF is stunning and seems to know exactly what you are going to do - I commend Nikon here greatly. The viewfinder is huge for a DX camera and is completely accurate to the final framing (100% accuracy); it's also very bright with a well thought-out layout of information. Shooting is seamless and breathtaking; 6 frames per second and a great trigger are to help here. Video performance is strong, though not as strong as I would have hoped; don't bother with continuous autofocus as it's not useful. Battery life is very good on the D7000; I can go for a few weeks of shooting on and off before worrying about charging the battery (which charges quickly).CONTROLS & FEATURES:Nikon did their homework here; the D7000 has the best button layout/ergonomics of any SLR I've used. I can do nearly everything without going into the menu - in fact it's possibly my least used button on the camera. All major controls can be accessed with one hand with the exception of the ISO button being to the left of the LCD (the only major complaint I have with this camera's ergonomics). I love the lockable drive-mode dial under the shooting-mode dial; it's incredibly handy. The thing that struck me the most was how customizable this camera is; the menus are fantastic and very deep and you can save several shooting setups within the menus and on the control dial (U1, U2). There are many buttons that can be re-assigned and programed in many configurations.  The top LCD is a little small, but provides loads of information; I just wish it had an extra spot to show your ISO without replacing the remaining frame-count. The addition of the professional trigger from the top-guns of the Nikon DSLR range is great; I love the firm, but 'squishy' feel that gives a very accurate release point. Size and weight are good, but I wish there was more space for fingers (the optional battery grip fixes this issue). I am very glad Nikon decided to put in a dual-SD card slot, though CF would have been nice too... but really, I'm asking too much considering the incredibly generous feature list. The AF selection button located on the manual-auto lever is nice, but is a bit hard to reach.  The LCD is very high-resolution and offers good contrast and color for accurate photo-previews.BUILD QUALITY:The D7000 feels like a brick, and I mean that in the best possible way.  Nikon's choice to go for a chunky magnesium block for the frame was a good one; this camera feels very, very well made.  The seams and edges meet very nicely and the rubber surfaces are adequately grippy.  The control dials are also grippy and come in handy during hot days (sweaty hands).  This camera just oozes quality and thoughtful design; bravo Nikon!PROS:- Ridiculous performance/ features for the price- Outstanding image quality- Outstanding dynamic range and color-depth- Sharp, contrasty images that render beautifully- Great images up to ISO 3200, usable up to 5000; not bad for a veteran of the current DSLR market- All around good AF system- Huge, 100% accurate viewfinder- 6 fps- Great shooting modes and controls- Very deeply customizable menus/controls- Well thought out ergonomics and controls that just work. Period.- Built like a magnesium tank- Has many pro features from higher-end camerasCONS:- Small-ish in size (could be a pro if you like this)- Overexposes slightly in bright sunlight- Average video performance (not a bad thing, just not as exemplary as the rest of this camera's performance)- ISO button needs to be near the exposure comp/ metering buttons (or at least on the right side)- ISO range could be better- Top LCD has no default spot for the currently set ISO- Body-grip rubber could be grippier- No CF slot, though dual SD is niceOverall the Nikon D7000 has strengthened my faith in Nikon for delivering top of the line performance in incredible packages. If you're not ready for FX, this is the next best thing.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best camera I've ever owned - and I've owned many!", "Author": "A. A. Katz", "ReviewID": "R36JXIRPH3DM8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a semi-professional photographer and have been shooting, with a variety of cameras, since the early 1960's. My first camera was a Kodak Brownie in 1960-or-so, followed my a Nikkormat in 1964.Since then I have had all kinds of film and digital bodies including Pentax, Nikon and Sony ultra-zooms.I had several of the earliest digital cameras, starting with the 2/3 megapixel Casio OM models, the Sony F series (great cameras in their days) and a variety of Nikon DSLRs, starting with the D70, and including the D200/300. Never went for full-frame because I shoot events, often from the back of a theater or arena, and appreciate the extra crop that comes with an APS-C sensor.But nothing, no camera I've ever owned, holds a candle to the D7000. Sometimes a manufacturer just gets everything right, and this is one of those times.DUO CARD SLOTSHaving two SD card slots means never having to say \"I'm sorry\". I use 2 16GB cards and when one is full, the camera switches over the other - which is only one of the two-slot options. Another is using one for photos, one for video.BATTERIESEven before receiving my D7000 body, I purchased an extra battery and worried that I might need a third. Many of my assignments require more than 1000 shots and quite a few hours on the shoot. But I'm stunned: I've never yet had the battery run out and had to switch to the second battery! In fact, I've shot multiple events without recharging between events, something I've never even considered doing with any previous camera! I don't know how they did it, but it is nothing less than amazing. I'll never forget losing shots at a New Year's fireworks display when my battery died in the middle of the show! Will never happen with the D7000.IMAGE QUALITYWhat can I say - it's the best image quality I've ever experienced, film or digital. Because many of my shoots are at low-light indoor events, I always used f/2.8 lenses and often shot wide-open at ISO 400. Result: low shutter speed and many shots lost to motion blur and the tiny depth of field of a wide-open f/2.8 aperture. Now I shoot at ISO 1600, smaller apertures, and totally acceptable shutter speeds - and I get pictures that need little post-processing and make my clients very, very happy.At ISO 1600 RAW, at a pixel level, there is a bit of noise. But it's like no noise I've ever seen before: it's so fine-grained and uniform that I can print without doing any noise reduction, or use just a hair of N/R to clean it up completely without sacrificing detail. Even my ISO 2500 shots come out better than my ISO 400 shots on the D200/D300! So impressive.AUTOFOCUSTo be honest, I was a bit disappointed, at first, at the quality of the autofocus - it was very fast, but not always accurate. I did fine-tune the AF for my lenses, which helped. But one day, on a lark, I switched from single-shot to continuous autofocus (AFC), which I rarely used in the past (with the exception of shooting sports), because I was annoyed by the lag and the number of out-of-focus shots the cameras allowed.But the D7000 is another story, entirely. I now shoot everything in AFC. It is thrilling to watch how fast the AF adjusts when you move the camera or zoom the lens - and I almost never miss focus on a shot, now. On top of that, you have predictive autofocus in AFC mode, where the camera calculates the motion of the subject and adjusts focus based on a mathematical calculation. The D7000 AF is faster and more accurate than any camera I've ever used. Bravo, Nikon!OTHER PROSThe Viewfinder is immaculate, bright and offers 100% coverage. No more framing errors! No more side-cropping needed!Video quality is excellent, though I don't use 1080p, since it can usually only be burned to Blu-Ray and my clients still want DVD presentation, so I stick to 720p. The results have been really excellent, though for best results, I recommend an external microphone setup (which I recommend for ANY serious video).CONSFor my needs and tastes, this camera has very, very few cons. I find the two-hands ISO setting to be a bit of a pain and usually have to use the menu on the LCD to accomplish it correctly.And I was a bit disappointed to discover that the artificial horizon, which I really need for stage shots, was only on the rear screen, and not in the viewfinder.It's not a big deal to me, since I shoot video at 720p/30fps, but the 1080p video only allows a frame rate of 24fps.All in all, the D7000 is the best camera I've ever owned, and its reasonable price just blows me away! I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone from a beginning DSLR user to a pro needing a second body and everyone in between.

I pray to _____ (deity of choice) that there will be a firmware fix for this.I know, I know... true video aficionados don't use auto focus.  But sometimes it's nice to have the option, right?  Well you don't.I shoot lots of video and manual focus on this thing is not for the faint of heart.  I have a shoulder rig with a follow focus and a screen magnifier and I work hard pulling focus, especially with subjects on the move.That having been said, buy this camera if you don't already have a stable of Canon lenses...

I enjoy shooting landscapes, architecture, and wildlife. After a lot of research, I decided on the D7000 as an upper level consumer camera, and the 18-200mm lens as a versatile lens solution for all the situations I anticipated.The camera itself is phenomenal. The viewfinder is vivid and clear, everything responds nicely, and it's solid. It's weighty, but not too much, which makes sense with the metal body. The built-in flash works well, even with the long lens (though I haven't tested how it casts shadows at the largest zoom). The only issue I've had is probably more an issue of getting used to a couple nuances of the camera. There are settings for being able to shoot without focus for two of the autofocus modes, but not for AF-A, so you have to fiddle with a button or tweak the focus ring slightly before the camera will respond to the shutter button.Thus far, the lens has been great as well. I was expecting it to be bigger than it is. It extends to a reasonable length, but still not that big, and at 18mm, it's a very manageable size. Some reviews show pincushion and barrel distortion from 150-200mm or so, which is visible when shooting architectural targets with many parallel or perpendicular lines. I haven't shot such scenes yet, and haven't noticed it in other shots, but there are software updates of some kind out for the lens/nikon software things that will automatically correct it, apparently.I haven't gotten to use the instructional booklets (other than the manual) yet, so I can't comment on those.The only issue that's at all concerning is with the supplied memory card. It's a SanDisk class 10 16 gig stick, which I have paired with an equivalent Team Group card. I have been shooting RAW+JPEG, which writes raw to one card and jpeg to the other. Two or three times, the camera has stopped me during shooting (flashing error in the viewfinder, card error or something on the little display lcd), saying that the first memory card (SanDisk) has errored. Sometimes it'll be fixed by turning the camera off and on, sometimes it'll quit complaining and just show the second memory card as being inserted. If I take the card out and put it back in, it'll read it and continue. I'm hoping it's just some weird thing with the memory card, not with the memory slot in the camera.*update* As I've shot a greater variety of photos, I've noticed several gradiations of grey spots in the upper area of my pictures. They are only really obvious when shooting solid background colors, such as a blue sky. A number of reviews at various places indicated they'd had to send the body back to nikon for cleaning, because the sensor had oil spots or something similar from manufacturing that wouldn't go away with an in-camera sensor clean. I tried a series of cleans and test shots and found they went away, or I thought they did, until they showed up again later. It could also be in the inner pieces of glass in the lens for me, though I'm not sure, as I don't have multiple lenses to try. It's a bit late to send in for repairs now, since I have a trip upcoming, but that's something to keep in mind--test with various types of shots and send it in while you can if you need to.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgrade from D5100!", "Author": "Plantasphilia", "ReviewID": "R2N45BKWPO2EVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review from an avid amateur user. Some people probably wonder the purpose of this \"upgrade\", since both D5100 and D7000 share the same sensor. It is obvious that D7000 has a tougher and heavier body. However, my main reason for the upgrade is the quality of picture. Really! From comparing and analyzing pictures taken by both cameras, I notice that pictures from D7000 are sharper and have more contrast, especially under less-than-perfect shooting conditions. The difference is from the better 39-point focus system of D7000. Under bright light, the picture quality should be very similar, if not the same. However, under low light and less contrast condition (such as foggy days), the difference is very noticeable. The D7000 performs very well and focuses accurately. Therefore, the pictures are sharper and exposed more accurately. In addition, I believe the heavier weight also play a part in sharper pictures due to less \"handshake\". Of course there are some personal shooting techniques and habits that can play a part in picture quality. However, this is the result from my personal experience. Furthermore, even though D7000 is heavier (than D5100), I don't feel sore or stress on my neck after half a day's shooting. It doesn't hurt either that the price on D7000 is dropping to an affordable level. The D5100 is still very good, easy to use, and an excellent entry into DSLR. However, the D7000 gives me the confidence and comfort of making something spectacular.

I sent the focus test photos to Nikon service and they said in this case I can send the camera to be evaluated. They adjusted the camera and sent it back to me. All done in one and a half week and under warranty. I tested it again and the issue had been resolved. Now, It is just a GREAT camera. The reason for the 4 star rating is the poor quality control. They should have tuned it in the factory before putting the camera in box.P.S. this was the second copy that I received with back focus issue. Yes, I returned the first one and got a replacement (Thanks to Amazon customer service). But the second one also had the same issue! This time I decided to send it to Nikon service.

I've been dreaming of a digital SLR since Nikon released the very first one. FINALLY, the price is right for me as a hobbiest.

There are seperately sold adapters that will run you over $100 and look to me to be an after thought rather than an intentional design.

It's certainly the best in all DX format Nikons right now and shooting with an f/1.4 lens, you can basically take shots in the dark. It has a lot of great in-camera editing that you can take advantage of while out snapping some shots. The HD video with a fast card looks incredible!

If you are the Hobbyist or aspiring up and coming photographer the D7000 will take you to that next level with little effort. The basic Auto settings right out of the box give incredible lighting, Auto-focus and overall adjustments leaving you with pictures that almost seem airbrushed or touched up to some degree. It's almost a shame to have so many wonderful controls and personal adjustments you can make and store on the D7000 when you'll be so happy with the Auto-settings. but once you feel more comfortable or branch out to more difficult shots, or more artistic renderings, you'll be grateful to have a camera so accommodating on so many technical and basic levels. If you want the tech specs, read a review anywhere from anyone and you'll have a dressed up opinion. If you want a great camera and a sound investment, get the D7000 and rely on yourself, not reviews.

Wanted to upgrade to newer model and D7000 came out. Very happy with my purchase. I try to shoot in low light condition and D7000 ISO performance is very good. I go till 1600 and very less noise.Video performance also very good, I shoot stage program with low light next day of camera arrival. I did not have to learn a lot to do so. It is very easy to operate. Live view/Info buttons are my favorite. I had to fight with my d80 to check the settings at night, that problem is solved with this.

Since its my 2nd day with this camera, I would like to compare the D80 to D7000.First the bad stuff:I was very comfortable using the D80 and got the colors dialed in right and knew how it reacted to different lighting conditions and its limitations, with the D7000, I am having problems with custom white balance + High Iso + changing Aperture. Somehow when I change the aperture the white balance changes, maybe its because I never could go beyond ISO800 to get a decent photo on my D80?, I don't know, but it bugs me a little bit. Also there looks to be more of a faded photo compared to the CCD of the D80, Or I'm just not setting it up right?Bracketing - why not have it go more then 3 photos? Common Nikon!The good stuff:Auto Focus motor - WOW ITS FAST! I really mean FAST! ITS F-ING FAST! your old (Motorless) lenses will get a new life with this body, I was shocked! I have a 24mm,35mm, and 50mm prime lenses as well as a Tokina 28-70 F2.8 and its FAST!  The D80 was painfully slow in this area.The Shutter - its fast and instant, no lag, compared to D80, this thing is amazing!High ISO - Its good, I wasn't surprised in this area after reading about it for months, but I still think image quality can be better, it does work much better with flash, Also saves battery life in my SB900 by bumping the iso to 1600 - 3200.Lots more stuff it can do - Maybe too much? I like the U1 U2 settings, I can set U1 for my strobes and U2 for Classroom, white balanced and everything.Overall : Definitely Happy with this camera, but want to see what the D300s replacement will be.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous (but needs some training)", "Author": "LensCrafter", "ReviewID": "R1K7ZF6WFZOYCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome upgrade from the D90 (colors are vivid, natural, and rarely over exposes plus great low light performance).However, it is somewhat soft at the default settings, and perhaps retains less details unless you have an upscale lens.The image quality (which is what really matters) is 40% better than D90 overall.

 While the D300s was (and is) an excellent still camera, the video support left something to be desired.  I ran the same test (and added some bonus footage) on the D7000 in this video review.I'm happy to say that a majority of the video issues have been resolved in this new iteration.  Rolling shutter is still an issue, but it's vastly improved. As you can see from my Thanksgiving footage the video is steady and smooth even without a tripod.  The \"jelly vision\" that plagued the D300s is largely gone.As a still camera the D7000 raises the bar over prior Nikon mid-level cameras.  While it's slightly slower than the D300s for stills, it feels a lot more \"pro\" than the D90 it replaces.  The D7000 is constructed out of a durable magnesium alloy body, sports two SD card slots, and has absolutely stunning low-light high ISO performance.  You won't need the flash often with a fast lens.Resolution and image quality is also improved.  The camera shoots at 16.2 megapixels, a decent bump in resolution from the prior model.  The D7000's DX \"crop sensor\" also means higher pixel density than more expensive Nikon cameras that shoot full frame - great for doing \"crop and zooms.\"Bottom line:  this is the camera I was hoping the D300s would be.  Excellent stills, durable construction, and outstanding video.  It's a worthy replacement of both the D90 and D300s and can easily fit into a professional or semi-professional environment.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera, ok seller", "Author": "James Brahier", "ReviewID": "RV79HA23DGQAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lets start from the beginning:I am upgrading my body from a D3000 to this camera and the extra features that it has and the little touch up makes this upgrade a must for those who are looking for one if you are getting work. Space wise my review is gonna be long but it will be nicely organized so you can see what part you are looking for.Features:This camera has a lot of them. The higher ISO performance is great and the fact that you can choose between 1/2 and 1/3 stops for just about everything on this camera, shooting RAW is not only a must but much easier to do. By being able to increase everything from shutter speed, aperture and ISO in 1/3 stops it makes manual truly feel manual. Also by being able to shoot in 1/3 stop ISO it allows you to cheat more and just barely over expose the shot without adding too much noise at the higher levels. Also if you have older lenses this will auto focus with them. Those lenses seem to be mis-focusing or slightly less sharp, you can in camera change that. There are many more features such as commander mode for flashes and etc. So if you want total control of the shot but don't want something that will intimidate you, this camera can be the one.ISO Performance:Seeing how I have very bad glass (18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 and 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6) I have to stay in the higher ISO's so to me this is great in some sense. Since I am force at this time to use f/5.6 a lot it's hard to get the shot I want. But this isn't much of a problem to be honest cause with a little adjusting in Lightroom you can use ISO 12800 images in RAW and still come out a winner. The grain is a little harsh but the color is easily corrected and for a HI 1.0 setting it does a pretty good job.Body Build:Theres no hiding the fact that this camera is heavy. But the fact that it's weather sealed and has a solid feel to it, makes up for it. The rubber grip feels really nice and it has a nice little \"cavern\" in it for your finger tips to tuck in to give you a nice hold on to the camera. Also the dual commander dials makes manual shooting more natural and more fun to do. Having certain buttons such as the AF mode button and dedicated buttons to ISO, exposure comp, etc., make hunting through tedious menus a thing in the past cause everything you need is practically at your finger tips. Something that is a nice thing to get use to if you plan on going full frame after using this camera for a few years.Seller Review:The seller that gave me the camera didn't include a body cap so when I looked through the view finder I thought the sensor was dirty but it's not so who cares. Though that is a big annoyance it doesn't affect the performance of this camera. Also it said that there was some minor cosmetic damage, and I didn't see it, which is great. The seller also forgot to say that the bottom rubber piece was missing, since I will be keeping the grip on it all the time it's more of an inconvenience for when I want to go street shooting then a real knock off. Basically minus one star cause of the seller in the fact that they forgot to mention some of this.Conclusion:I am an upcoming semi-professional event shooter so the high ISO performance, high FPS and the ability to have a real grip means a lot to me. If you are someone who wants to upgrade just cause, don't waste your time. It can be over whelming to you if you don't know what each button does yet alone where the things are. And I watched a lot of views and read the manual before even getting the camera. Though there is a learning curve cause you have everything at your finger tips if you are coming form a D3000 or equiv. body, in the end it's going to be worth it and this camera will be the one that will get you the shot. Also this camera might get me into cine just for the giggles.Should I Wait:In all honesty if you are asking this question it's like asking when is it a good time to buy a tablet. Get something that will fulfill your needs and just be happy with it. In all honesty the D7100 (or whatever Nikon will call it) won't come out for probably the next few years or so (1/29/13) from now. But who knows exactly besides Nikon. If you still want to wait and are trying to choose between this and a new lens, get the lens if you don't feel safe buying the camera now. Glass goes with you but the body won't just keep that in mind.Thanks for reading my review.

All reviews are subjective by the nature of the beast.  You may find problems in my appraisal of this camera, so take it with a grain of salt.Cons:Unless you are a professional photographer you will find the Nikopn supplied User's Manual (as usual) useless.  There are many excellent manuals/dvds on this camera, so don't worry about it.  My package arrived on time with the camera body.  Whether it is the fault of Nikon or the supplier, the warranty on the camera was missing.  If you have excessive patience and a high frustration capability you can try Nikon Customer Service.  Not me--I have tried. At my age there is not so much time to waste so I will cross my fingers.  If, like me, you need instructions I will be reviewing the aids later.Pros:This camera is terrific.  I began using a point and shoot digital about 7 years ago, switched to a wonderful Sony, and was so impressed by that I went on to a digital SLR Nikon D5100.  Great camera, but I wanted more control so the D7000 was chosen.to say I am pleased is an understatement. Once you learn the basics this camera will do anything you want and things you never dreamed of doing.  I would like it if the LCD viewer moved like the D5100 but that ius something I am willing to overlook.  The durability of this camera is profound; take it from a clumbsy photographer.  The camera allows you control over everything from disabling the in-camera flash to ISO to shutter speed to white-balance to focus point and much more.  You can take beautiful pictures of any and everything.  I do a lot of macro and this is great!  Replace the Nikon neck strap and you are safe and secure.I have read of people using the D90 (this camera's predecessor) for twenty years and I believe my heirs will ahve this for at least that long.If you buy this wonderful camera and a decent manual for its functions, you can be a great photographer with a little practice.

I have an upcoming trip to Alaska to really put the test to it, I plan on updating my review after getting a more aquainted with everything it has to offer.I plan on using this camera to do some serious photography, from what I have seen so far, it can & will handle what I want.EDIT:  After returning from Alaska, all I can say is I am REALLY impressed.  From Crunching 6 Frame-per-second pictures of flying eagles, to snapping pictures of Surfacing whales in a fraction of a second from when I first saw them, it never failed me.I DO NOT take pictures with my camera set to \"auto\", newbies or others with not a lot of experience with a camera such as this, might struggle some. However, if you get a good guide and read it, this camera can open up a whole new world to your photography.  I have read quite a few \"focus error\" posts on here, I had a couple too....  until I set it for how I was shooting, I have had ZERO problems since.If you do not know what you are doing with a digital SLR, this is not an easy camera to get great pictures with... good pictures sure.

This review is not intended to be Canon VS Nikon debate. But the reason I decided to finally pick this camera because after reading and researching online from article, reviews, and image sample, my heart telling me to go with Nikon. I'm not saying Canon is not a good brand, but its true when people say, you just need to go to the store, and hold the camera for yourself, because even Nikon has several different size DSLR. And when I hold D7000, the grip just feel right. The second reason is also a budget. Everyone has their budget and within that budget you have to decide which one would be the best one for your needs. I'm a beginner, so my eyes couldn't tell the difference between picture sample from different kind DSLR. I mean for me, no matter what your DSLR brand is, the picture of bright day light scenery (with good lighting) is all amazing (Nikon, Canon, Sony, Pentax, Olympus), but when I see the sample image of Nikon D7000 (with bundle lens 18-55 VR) in night time (low light photography), I was blown away. Its really true what most people say in reviews that Nikon D7000 has the best low light capability (in non-full frame DSLR catagory). But I am sure, things will definitely change over time, but if you want to get a DSLR camera now, this year (2011), I definitely recommend this one! I'm very satisfy with every single picture I took with this camera (well more of 90% of the click I made, the rest 10% bad shot because of my stupidity being an amateur photographer). I shoot in manual tho.I'm excited about my new found interest in photography and I hope Nikon will keep making great Camera in the future. I have no negative things to say about this camera.

Bottom line is that this camera produces some fantastic pictures.

I don't think anybody has actually pinned the reason down yet, wether it is focus missing, harder shutter slap, or greater pixel pitch.I would say that 97% of the time this camera produces super sharp results with the right technique. But every once in a while it will simply miss focus (somthing my d80 never did).  Also, if your technique is sloppy it will show easier.

I enjoy hiking and travel and this camera has all the capabilities to make any shots.  For the SLR novice it takes less than 10 minutes to get started.  What else can one ask for?  Nikon has done an exceptional job with the 4 page insert to get one started that came with my camera kit.  The manual that comes with the camera is exceptionally logical arranged and serves as a great learning manual to become familiar with all the functions and possibilities.  Key for me is to read on a feature and right away put it into action.My camera came with the 18mm to 200mm AF-S Nikkor GII ED VR for DX format cameras.  It's a one lens solution for me allowing pictures in a small room at wide angle and for some telephoto needs.  This lens is versatile.  Even though I did purchase the fixed focus 50mm f/1.8 D AF lens because of the shutter speeds it allows at low light (no flash) and for the depth of focus control (like taking a picture of a blossom while the rest of the background is blurred at apperture 1.8 for example).It helps to understand a few physical concepts or to be teachable, but the camera is really for anyone interested in photography at a somewhat more interesting level.  I think this camera is suitable even for beginners if interested in what SLR cameras can offer.  Some of the 2 star reviews speak for themselves.I took some amazing pics within the first 24 hours which are simply not doable with point and shoot cameras.  I have not tested the video on this camera, because I did not purchase the camera for that.  However there are some videos floating out there that are amazing, but it's mostly not my interest and my expectations to video would be a lot more relaxed, because I personally buy a SLR camera to take still pictures with ... of exceptional quality and this camera does exceptional.Thomasnikond7000dslr.org", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great photo quality,", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R3V2PQ8UZBH6U1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A solid camera with great image quality especially at high ISO.  3200 looks as good as the D200 at 800.

If an external mic helps, nikon has some info on this on their website, then that is a min. of 75 more.  That was the least expensive mic they suggested/recomended.  If you fix the focus or use manual focus it will be ok.  That is the only work around. Focus, auto that is, is terrible. If the movie aspect was not a joke then I would have given this 5 stars.  I did not buy this for that aspect, however, Nikon is selling, marketing and pricing it this way. I may try the external mic but do not believe this will help much.One other thing....Nikon support is terrible. Very few people know much about what Nikon sells.

I have won several awards for my films and used many different cameras. In the market for affordable, but high quality DSLR Camera that shoots videos, I found myself in the procession of the Nikon D7000 Kit. It comes with an 18-105mm lens, a rechargeable battery, and a battery charger. Being a highly functional and useful camera, it comes with awesome features, but there are minute technical issues when first getting used to the camera and it lacks a few minor features, but ultimately, the Nikon D7000 Kit is an exceptional camera for its price. The Nikon D7000 is a highly functional camera because it is easy to put together and it takes high quality photographs. Shot after shot taken with the camera's 16.2 megapixels, whether using manual focus or autofocus, produces vivid and eloquent photographs. Great DSLR cameras take amazing photographs. The camera incorporates awesome features as it is supplied with basic features as well as features you didn't know you needed. Autofocus is a basic function, but there are two types on this camera. One for moving objects and the other for still objects. Also, there is a continuous mode, which allows the user to snap six photos per second, which is nice when your subject makes subtle movements. The camera has dual memory card slots for extra storage and also, face detection. There are a few minor features the camera lacks. For instance, it does not possess panorama mode, smile mode, and is not waterproof. However, there are not many DSLR that include a waterproof feature and none that are affordable. Consequently, good cameras have standard features as well as bonus features. The D7000 contains quality video capabilities. There are a couple drawbacks, but nothing too troubling. Overall, its features over compensate for its minor negative one.  The only drawbacks include: the camera does not display the light meter and the user cannot change exposure compensation, both while in video mode. However, the Nikon D7000 shoots in 1,080p and 24 frames per second.  Shadow bars rest at the top and bottom of the screen to show the user that, if his/her subject does not sits within the bars, it will not be recorded. Furthermore, this camera records up to twenty minutes, while other DSLR cameras struggle to have this ability. This aspect is ideal for shooting documentaries. As mention before, the dual memory card slot, which is quite idea for video shooting and other DSLRs are not often equipped with it. A good DSLR should incorporate the ability to record in its system. The Nikon D7000 Kit is affordable. The kit is under a thousand dollars at $996.95 and is it a whole lot of camera for that price. High quality DSLRs range from $500 to $2,000. This camera is on the low end of that spectrum while still having all its amazing and standard features. Also, it comes the 18-150mm lens with a rechargeable battery and a battery charger. High quality cameras should be affordable as this one is. As the filmmaker and photographer I am, the Nikon D7000 simply wows me. It is a very practical and functional camera with great features. There are a few things would discourage someone from buying it, but they would have to be very picky about taking underwater panorama photos.

I turns out that the poor focus on some pictures I'd been blaming on myself turned out to be a well known problem called back focusing.  Just when I was about to take the time to laboriously reset the focus, the camera puked oil onto it's sensor today.  Turns out that has been a problem too.  Boy am I mad.I figured I'd have the sensor cleaned and sell it and buy a d600.  Guess what?  The d600 also has oil on the sensor problems.

I also described the SCORES or similar problems with the spots in the same place. I even mentioned an occasional instance of Nikon doing the right thing and REPAIRING the camera's shutter box to fix the problem even on cameras out of warranty.Nikon REFUSED to even clean the sensor at no charge saying that it's out of warranty and that's the end of it.

Since owners' manuals typically do a less-than-satisfactory job of explaining things, I also opted to buy a well-thought-out book complete with photos that show exactly what's being explained: \"David Busch's Nikon D7000 Guide to Digital SLR Photography.\" It's a very helpful book.There's so much to the D7000 that it's easy to think it's malfunctioning when the problem is really something else...possibly something as small as having programmed it so that it doesn't fire unless it's completely in focus. I personally LOVE this feature and intentionally set it this way. Others, however, may not realize that this feature even exists, or may have forgotten that they set it to operate this way. Thus, they press the shutter and...nothing happens. RATS! Missed the shot! This is not a camera malfunction; it's an operator error.The D7000 takes great pics in all situations and has helpful features like exposure compensation; several metering options; depth-of-field preview; bulb setting (for long exposures); exposure, flash, white balance, and ADL bracketing; incredible choice of ISO sensitivity (use with care; high ISO levels can cause \"noise\" and less-than-perfect coloring), diopter adjustment (aids less-than-perfect vision through the viewfinder), and so forth...WAY too many to mention here.I love the double card slots that can be programmed for various uses. And of course, the D7000 captures in NEF (RAW), JPEG (with choice of quality), and RAW + JPEG simultaneously.With the D7000's countless other features, it will probably be quite some time before you have mastered this camera, so just relax and enjoy as you practice perfecting your skills.The D7000 is an excellent choice for the photo enthusiast/semi-pro and there are pros who use it...it's that good. Can you get a better camera? Sure! You can buy a Daguerreotype Giroux for about $980,000 or more. But why do that when, chances are, the D7000 is MORE than enough to suit your needs.BOTTOM LINE: I highly recommend the D7000. But whichever you choose to buy, LEARN THE CAMERA. Learn its various settings and what happens when you program it a certain way. And BE SURE TO BUY GOOD QUALITY LENSES! They are your BEST investment.Check YouTube's how-to videos; buy books like \"Understanding Exposure\" by Bryan Peterson and \"The Photographer's Eye\" by Michael Freeman. LEARN! LEARN! LEARN!

Read on...After being a Canon user ( 450D XSI with 24-105L & 70-300IS 4.5-5.6, Speedlite EX 580EX), I finally decided to give Nikon a try and what better model than the much acclaimed D7000 to make the leap!Amazon promptly delivered my wishlist and the first 3 days I spent hours of controlled shots - Still life, Tripod mounted, manual and programmed exposures - comparing the image quality between my entry level, 4 year old Canon XSI and the D7000. While exposure accuracy and high ISO noise levels (significantly) were better on the D7000, I was aghast to notice that the D7000 could never match the image sharpness of my faithful 4 year old Canon, which cost less than half of the Nikon. Did I make a wrong choice? Google to the rescue - I quickly realized I am not alone in being unhappy with the soft images from D7000. Few more days of research, and a comparison with my friend's D90 reiterated my worst fears - MY D7000 PROVIDES SOFT IMAGES. No matter if I cranked up the default In-camera sharpness to 7 or 8 from 3 - these were simply not sharp. Swapping the 18-105  kit lens from my D7000 with my friend's D90 was quite a revelation - The problem was with the lens severely back focussing and not with the D7000 body - Whew!. The back focus was beyond what could be adjusted with D7000's AF micro adjust. By -20 ( the limit), sharpness improved, but still not matching to my old Canon.Then I called Amazon - requested for a replacement lens. The customer support person after a lengthy consultation with his supervisor, informed since the lens is part of the camera kit, they will have to replace both my camera and lens, and a replacement was being sent to me immediately - 5 STARS TO AMAZON FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT.  As for Nikon, that Kit lens should not have passed their QC, which led me to doubt the fine camera's quality - So, only FOUR STARS FOR NIKON.Unfortunately, I had to go out of town for couple of weeks, while my replacement D7000 arrived and awaiting the verdict. OK, I got  back and started the comparison between the old and the replacement D7000s and to my big releif, found the replacement body and the kit provided the sharpness I expected form a camera of this repute.With the old Nikon back in mail enroute to Amazon returns, and couple of hundred shots on my new Nikon (Controlled comparison tests, family outing and a kids' birthday party) later, I am ready for rating my priced posession. My benchmark is obviously the Canon XSI I was used to, albeit with professional ( L series) lens, and I am listing the subjective elements than the superior specifications.D7000: ProsOverall image quality (provided you are fortunate to get a 18-105 lens without back / front focus issues).Very low noise levels and good image quality up to ISO 1600, even ISO 3600 provides very usable pictures.Noticeably better dynamic range.Very good JPEG engine - Though I shoot primarily RAW, many JPEGS are useable as-is.More stable body, allowing hand holding at slower speeds. Extra weight does not hurt.Soft and refined shutter release compared to the Canon's metallic click.Higher res LCD & bigger view finder.More accurate Auto White Balance - Very few need post processing.Faster continuous shooting ( Not relevant to me, as I shoot landscapes, not sports)39 AF Points - especially when you want to compose with subjects off center.Movie mode with continuous AF - Continuous AF is not as reliable as in a consumer handycam, neverthelss it is there.2 SD card slots - allowing me to record RAW in one and JPEGS n the other.Cons:Only one so far - tendency to over expose under difficult conditions.18-105 Lens:Pros: Excellent range, light, good sharpness for lens of this price range, fairly fast focussing, relatively smooth zoom action.Cons: Heavy barrel distortion at wide end of Zoom, prone to lens flare when shooting into light.Bottom line: Was this a worthy upgrade? I gain better low light performance with lower noise levels - ISO 1600 on teh D7000 is comparable to or better than ISO 800 on the Canon XSI in terms of noise. Better dynamic range allows me to get pictures which would have burnt otherwise.Will keep updating as I get more experience with this camera.ThanksSuresh Nair", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera!

The frame rate is so fast that I have to set it on CL to keep from constantly clicking off 2 frames when I only intend 1.  I have not noticed any of the hot pixels that some have complained about.

Proper use of white balance and ISO are also critical to really nail colors and fidelity. It's also an extremely responsive camera.

The D7000 focuses faster and with more intelligence as it has many more focus points (39 versus 11).  The new shutter system is extremely quick and quiet.  The VIDEO, especially now that it supports 720P at 30fps, is hugely improved, and I've found snagging quick vids of the kids has become invaluable.  I see no need to shoot 1080p, which is just overkill.But, the D7000 really is aimed at the insatiable enthusiast who'll never leave the camera set on \"A.\"  The D7000 is meant to be tweaked and customized beyond what a cheaper camera might allow.  If you're only seeking a camera with zero shutter lag that offers cleaner shots with better colors, deeper blacks, and those blurry backgrounds, then any cheaper D-SLR will do, especially the D3100 (if you're a Nikon fan).  Don't bother spending the cash on the D7000 if you don't plan on READING the entire manual, exploring the vast menus, buying several lenses, and relentlessly seeking alternative ways to capture images.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Another brilliant DSLR by Nikon", "Author": "Mr J Williams", "ReviewID": "RQWPEPL3JZMP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hugely customisable, shoots 1080p video, amazing quality photos and easy to use - a very much needed upgrade.The good:- Really great looking camera, solid build, massive 3\" LCD screen on the back- the D7000 manages to fit all the necessary dials and buttons onto a relatively small and light body and they are all exactly where you need them to be- 1080p video at 30fps, with face and subject tracking- Live View mode on the LCD for both pics and video- The option to attach an external stereo mic- Amazing low-light functionality, even at very high ISO levels there is little noise on the image- Two SD card slotsThe bad:- The auto-focus on the video isn't very quick- If you use the in-built mic, rather than an external one, the noise of the AF is very obvious when you playback the videoConclusion:The D7000  is brilliant, versatile, sturdy, customisable, fast, looks great, all for a very fair price.

The camera I have used before this is a Lumix GH2 which I like a lot. I have been using my GH2 to do professional work for clients with quite a bit of success, which is why I decided to get a D7000.A lot of these reviews either echo what you can find on digicam review sites, or they compare it to other Nikon models. Why am I comparing it to a GH2? Because I own both and therefore I can, and I'm going to bet that there are people who are in the market for a camera and may be considering either the D7K or the GH2...so lets see how they stack up.Camera Body Build-------------------In terms of ruggedness the D7000 has the advantage. Its magnesium frame (it's not made entirely from metal as some people believe) provides a high level of strength without adding to its bulk too much. It feels solid; the GH2 is entirely plastic and feels \"plasticy\", but it doesn't have a cheap feel. The GH2 does allow for a firm grip to prevent blurry photos. The D7K and certain lenses have \"weather sealing\" which help to keep dust and debris out of the camera and the GH2 has none of that.The GH2 is a mirrorless micro 4/3 camera where light weight and compact size is intended. The lack of a mirror means there's one less fragile CRITICAL element that can break if the camera is dropped - despite having a rugged body, the mirror in the D7K can be damaged if the camera takes a good hit...almost like having an egg \"protected\" by a steel box, but no padding in the box.For sheer exterior ruggedness the D7K wins, but the GH2 being lighter and not relying no a mirror means it can stand up to some \"minor abuse\" without damage.Buttons and Ergonomics-------------------The D7K has a lot of buttons placed on the back and front sides of its body, plus a few on top. You might even say it has \"too many\" buttons. Much like a video game controller or keyboard, once you get used to the button positions you can quickly and efficiently change various settings on the fly. Things like exposure, ISO, white balance can be adjusted by holding down the appropriate button and using the selector wheel to set the desired option.The GH2 takes a more advanced approach to feature management. While it does have buttons for common functions like white balance and ISO, almost all of the settings can be changed using the \"Q Menu\" button right on the screen. It also allows you to map the function buttons however you want (the D7K has this feature too).One of the GH2's major assets is an articulating touch-screen LCD. While it may sound like a gimmick, you can easily set the focal point just by touching the screen. You can even take pictures by tapping the screen, and it will focus on the area you tap. Similar functionality on the D7K requires fiddling around with the focusing area and metering type buttons, and does not provide that level of flexibility.Both cameras give you an amazing level of control over the pictures you take, but I feel that the GH2's approach is a lot more intuitive and fun. The articulating touchscreen is dearly missed and if the D7K had one, it would really unlock its potential.Viewfinder and LCD Screen-------------------The D7000 has a higher resolution LCD screen, and it is quite nice, but it's not very useful beyond previewing images and changing menu settings. Taking pictures with the D7000 happens through its optical viewfinder.In the past, I would have said that an optical viewfinder is a desirable feature, but in the age of digital cameras it is an obsolete element that should be phased out. The GH2 features an EVF (electronic viewfinder) which means that the image you see in the viewfinder is exactly what you will end up with after taking a shot.The EVF in the GH2 has a higher resolution than the its own LCD screen as well as the LCD screen on the D7000, so it is very accurate and sharp...plus you gain the ability to see realtime info such as a histogram and exposure settings displayed while looking through the viewfinder. The optical viewfinder on the D7000 is \"full frame\", which means you are able to view the entire frame of the photo through the viewfinder, but it is dim compared to the EVF and the lack of realtime info means you have to either check the LCD screen or the digital readout to see what's what.The EVF, along with the GH2's touchscreen capabilities give it a solid lead in usability, making it a very \"fast\" camera in terms of getting the shot you want without having to mess around with settings.Lenses and Image Quality-------------------This is where things get dicey...and you may think it's a slam dunk for the D7000 considering that still pictures are really all it is good for, but that's not the case.First of all, the POTENTIAL quality with the D7000 is much higher than the GH2. The D7K has a wider effective dynamic range in both brightness and color gamut, and the pictures it takes are very pleasing to the eye with minimal post-processing on the RAW files. The caveat is that you need a very good lens to get these results, and this is where you hit a conundrum with the D7000.The D7000 is a professional-grade camera for all intents and purposes, but it has a DX sensor which Nikon decided to relegate to \"consumers\". This means that you have a superb camera body that is hobbled by a multitude of mediocre DX lenses. I actually didn't know how bad things were until I started looking for quality Nikon lenses.With Nikon, the best current-model lenses are for the FX format and the bulk of them are in the $1000+ range. Quality FX fast primes can be $400 or more, and there is one \"pro grade\" DX lens, the 17-55mm f/2.8 nikkor, which costs more than the camera. I have the 17-55mm lens because it covers the most widely used focal lengths and is f/2.8 - so it's decent but not great in dim light.What about fast DX primes? Sure, there are many DX f-mount compatible primes out there, even from third party manufacturers...but they all seem to suck wide open (softness, slow focus in low light, nasty chromatic aberration issues). These things are all issues I never had with the GH2 and MFT lenses, so I was taken aback because I expected that Nikon would have had it's game together considering its industry status.Worst of all, Nikon seems to think that it's acceptable to sell lenses with PLASTIC LENS MOUNTS. Wow, really? Look I know cost-cutting is in but let's keep the lens mounts metal -- meanwhile all of my GH2 lens are solidly built and have METAL mounts. It's not a \"premium\" feature for the MFT lenses to be well-constructed so I have to say that despite the larger selection of F-mount compatible lenses that you can mount on your D7000, a lot of them are garbage that do not allow the camera to perform at its full potential.The TL;DR of the above is that the D7000 has greater still-image potential but is hobbled by the mass of generally shoddy (aka consumer-grade) DX lens quality. Use of FX lenses on the D7000 is possible, but why? If you have the money to by FX lenses, get a FX camera...The GH2 (or any other MFT camera) has a smaller selection of high to very high quality lenses at affordable prices, plus you can buy adapters that allow you to use just about any lens out there on your MFT camera.Low Light Photos-------------------Taking pictures in low light with the GH2 and a fast prime lens works, but there is no comparison with the D7000. Even with a cheapo made-in-china 35mm f/1.8G DX lens, you will get better results with the D7000 by a wide margin. The D7000 has a sensor that is about 60% larger than the GH2's MFT sensor, and it is capable of yielding usable photos up to 6400 ISO. The GH2's low-light performance is respectable and you can shoot away at 3200 ISO to get similar results as the D7000 at 6400 ISO, but physics rears its ugly head and a bigger sensor with wider dynamic range and less noise spells a win for the D7000 in low light shooting.Auto Focus-------------------DSLRs like the D7000 use a \"phase detect\" auto focus system, which works in conjunction with the in-lens \"CPU\" to gauge distance to subject, which allows for a subject to be tracked in motion with focus maintained. On paper this sounds nice, but in reality most photographers are still using an anticipatory method to pre-focus on an area where they believe their subject will end up to get nice motion shots.The GH2's \"contrast detect\" AF system was once regarded as an inferior method since it lacks the D7000's tracking capability (due to lack of distance info), but it is so fast that it hardly matters. Using the same anticipatory method along with the GH2's touch screen shutter release, you can take shots of fast action \"just like the big boys\".Low light focusing is slower on both cameras, and both use an AF-assist lamp, but I feel the GH2 does a better job of locking on consistently in low light shooting vs the D7000.The GH2's AF system is blazingly fast and I can't recall ever losing a shot due to its AF. The D7000 has cost me a few shots due to its AF system's questionable subject selection. It's also worth noting that some lenses focus a lot slower than others on the D7000, whereas most MFT lenses have quicker average AF response times.Video Recording-------------------This is one area where the GH2 has no real competition (to date) - it was and still is hands down the BEST video recording device under $2,000. The D7000 can record at a maximum of 1080p @ 24 FPS, while the GH2 offers both 1080P @ 30 and 24 FPS. The video quality produced by the GH2 is noticeably sharper, and since both cameras use contrast detect AF for video, the GH2 is able to focus much faster and more accurately during video recording. The built-in mic on the GH2 is stereo and very good quality; the D7000 has a mono mic built in with average sound quality.I would not bother using the D7000 if video recording is my main objective, but it can shoot video in a pinch.Conclusion-------------------It is nice being able to do a head-to-head comparison, largely based on how I use both cameras personally and professionally. I really like my D7000 and I am not disappointed by purchasing it...but I do feel that Nikon needs to realize that not all pro photographers want or need a full-frame camera, yet they do want professional-quality DX options.The 17-55mm Nikkor lens was a start - it's basically a set of primes in one, albeit f/2.8 max. It's a great, sharp lens that lets the D7000 take some incredible pictures (obviously superior to the best photos I've taken with my GH2)...but then you have junk like the all-plastic Nikon 35mm f/1.8g prime which doesn't really get good (in terms of sharpness and general IQ) until you stop it down to f/3.5 or better - sort of defeating the purpose of a fast prime.With that said, if I had to choose ONE camera between the GH2 and D7000 it would be the GH2. The reason quite simple: The GH2 doesn't get in my way at all; it lets me take the pictures I want to take the way I want to take them and I have no gripes about any of my MFT lenses - they all work as intended.The D7000's superior still image capabilities really only shine when using top-quality (read: expensive) lenses intended for FX format cameras. I cannot give this excellent camera any less than 4 stars, but I cannot give it a 5 star rating due to the major quality discrepancy between the D7000 camera and available DX lenses.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressed thus far...", "Author": "Bookstore Willie", "ReviewID": "R2WV42J5GZQH4C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only been using the D7000 for a few days but first impressions are sometimes useful to others and often forgotten as the newness wears off. So I'll share a few early impressions while they are still fresh in my mind. First off as others have pointed out this camera has a real Quality feel to it. Nothing at all like the Canon T2i and other enthusiast level cameras. It feels rock solid and very well put together. Weight wise it's not a lightweight by any means but it's nowhere near as large and heavy as the pro cameras. Still with the Nikon 70-300 VR attached I was glad to have ordered a fancy padded neck strap with it as I spend long days aboard my boat as a marine photographer shooting photos of watercraft, as well as long days in the mountains hiking rugged trails and shooting landscapes. In terms of being user friendly almost all of the controls are logically organized and conveniently placed. Compared to the Olympus E-300 that's been my workhorse unit for the past few years the D7000 is a virtual paragon of good design. This is a good thing because  this is one very feature rich camera with so many bells and whistles that Nikon could easily (and profitably) offer doctoral programs in its use.My short lived love affair with Japanese factory manuals died a sudden death in 1984 when the manual that came with my Toyota pickup truck advised me to \"Not use windshield wipers on dry grass!\" And no, the last word is not a typo, that is precisely what the manual said. So even before ordering my new D7000 from B&H; I ordered a 3rd party D7000 manual from Alibras. When it arrived I was all but overwhelmed by the complexity of this camera. Menus have submenus, and submenus have endless choices. The mere thought of someone new to digital photography buying this camera makes me glad I don't sell cameras for a living! Sure, as with any complex tool you can \"Grow  into it\" but believe you me there are going to be some growing pains for those just becoming involved in digital photography! I should, in fairness, add that the factory manual accompanying the D7000 is not bad at all. In fact I would say it's one of the best Japanese manuals I've ever read.Happily by the time I had read a few hundred pages things began to look doable if I'd just hang in there and get the basics down. In fairness to the D7000 I should point out here that I've allowed myself to fall way behind when it comes to camera technology. Someone moving to the D7000 from a D90 or one of the many other later vintage enthusiast cameras put out by others won't face anywhere near as steep a learning curve.Speaking of which, even when things go bad there is often a bright side to it. To whit, the first time I took the D7000 out to make some images I managed to set the auto ISO feature incorrectly and thus wound up with 25 shots taken at an ISO of 3200! The bright side of this was that I'd been duplicating all the images shot with the D7000 with my trusty Olympus E-300 set at an ISO of 100. Now the E-300 is no slouch when it comes to image quality but low noise is not one of its strong points. Still, when I discovered I'd shot all the D7000 images at an ISO of 3200 I felt confident that the ISO 100 shots I'd made with my E-300 would be far superior. Imagine my shock when I discovered that was simply not the case.  Quite the contrary, the D7000 images were superior! Wondering if this was a fluke I shot some photos of my cat in available light the next day at an ISO of 2500 and then compared them with the best images I've taken with the E-300 over the past several years at an ISO of 100. If you can believe this the D7000 shots were heads and shoulders better. In fact, the best shot of the bunch was shot with the Nikon 70-300 VR lens at a setting equal to 380 mm, at a shutter speed of 1/30\" and an F stop of 5.6 and it was simply stunning! Every whisker sharp as a tack!So, it's fair to say that based on my initial experience with the D7000 I am quite pleased. I will get back with further comments after I've shot a few  thousand more frames.12/17/2011Well I'm back. Having shot 15,000+ frames with my D7000 I can only say that I grow ever more impressed with this camera. Image quality is simply superb! I commonly get images of a quality I simply would never have believed possible back when in the 1970s when I was a full time photojournalist shooting with top of the line Nikons and film. High ISO performance is also spectacular and I constantly have to fight my fear that bumping up the ISO will cause radical dropoff in image quality as was the case with my previous Olympus E-300 camera. While it's always wise to shoot at the lowest ISO practical I've found that anything up to 1000 is just fine for most of my work. Image stabilization with my AFS NIkkor 70-300mm G is also superb! In truth my use of a tripod has dropped more than 75% since the purchase of this camera and lens. I am constantly astounded by how low I can go shutter speed wise while handholding this outfit!!!! Simply unbelievable at times how good the images are shot handheld at shutter speeds of less than 1/60\" with a 300mm lens.Any complaints? Well yes, there are a few. I find the control knob devoted to mode selection is very easy to rotate by accident...it needs a locking mechanism like that supplied for the release mode control beneath it. More times than I like to think of I've had a shot spoiled as a result of the mode selection having been shifted accidently.  I would also like to see the AE-L AF-L button repositioned to the right as it's a long reach with my right thumb while continuing to maintain pressure on the shutter button. I do have small hands so this might not be quite as serious a problem for those with larger hands. Perhaps my biggest gripe is with the dust reduction feature. Simply put my British mother would say this is \"Rubbish!\" Within weeks of using my D7000 I was seeing dozens of dust specks on the sensor and when I use apertures smaller than F!0 I have to devote a lot of time to retouching them out in Lightroom. And this despite the fact that I seldom change lenses and when I do I do so following scrupulous dust avoidence techniques. By contrast the dust reduction in my Olympus E-300 (many years out of date!) rates a 10 out of 10 score while the D7000 rates a 2 out of 10 score. With Olympus currently in terrible financial trouble the time is ripe for Nikon to approach them behind closed doors with an offer to license the Olympus dust reduction system for Nikon cameras. It would be the best investment Nikon ever made.Finally, how about the issue of the D7000 meter consistently overexposing images? Well I have had some problems with this but have found the difficulty mostly related to how the metering system factors in color differences in light reflectivity. There is a wonderfully clear section on this in David Burchs D7000 manual and once you read it most if not of your overexposure problems will vanish.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Good Camera", "Author": "logodaedaly", "ReviewID": "R3SWDF1ZEG7E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I migrated 2 months ago from D40. I read the reviews and was ready to spring until I read concerns about auto focus being blurry on shots. I ultimately purchased from ABT, which has a generous return policy. In my opinion, there is no focus issue. The camera is very good and I am very happy with it. I would note, I shoot with my kit 18-55 mm D40 lens and I am very happy with the shots.Given that this is a very expensive purchase, I had exhaustively looked at the reviews and the comment boards. The only surprise upon purchase is Nikon has added a clumsy USB interface that requires downloading all photos through its Nikon Transfer 2 program. I have an iMAC.SD camera cards should show up as external devices when hooked up. With my D40, all I do is connect the camera and download JPG/RAW files to my hard drive. However, the D7000 does not show up as an external device when hooked up.  This is a real annoyance. Fortunately, I found a simple workaround.One Nikon support person claimed the issue was that I was using an \"unapproved\" SD card (I am using Transcend SD HC card). However, the problem of card nonrecognition persisted even when I switched to a different SD card from my D40, one that had always been recognized by my computer. Another Nikon support person claimed that the only way to transfer files was through their Nikon Transfer 2 program. My reading of the manual suggests that Nikon does not intend for the D7000 to directly show up as an external device. The manual only refers to the Nikon Transfer 2 program.In any event, with my Mac computer, only way to \"see\" D7000 files is with Nikon's enclosed Nikon Transfer 2 program. I already use Adobe Bridge and Aperture 3 and have no interest in an extra forced layer of preprocessing. Nikon support claims that its intermediary program is necessary because Nikon RAW files are different than other RAW files. Perhaps. But Photoshop has a plug-in that converts these files just fine, thank you. And as for JPEG these files, these should be unconditionally visible and easily migrated from SD card to hard drive, as there is no special conversion or handling required.But as I said, there is a simple workaround: Apple's Image Capture program. A different workaround was proposed by Ken Rockwell, who suggested purchasing a SD card reader. And I did, but a cheap reader from Radio Shack did not work, so I returned it. I was about to go purchase a different SD card reader, when I stumbled upon a far simpler solution.  As I noted, iMAC does not recognize a plugged in D7000. Nor does Aperture 3 or Adobe Bridge recognized the D700. Curiously, however, iPhoto and Apple's Image Capture programs DO recognize the D7000. Go figure.Downloading with Image Capture is very, very easy and as simple as plug and download for the D40. It is faster and avoids all the hassle related to Nikon's Image Transfer Program 2. I use it all the time and now the issue of file transfer is transparent to me. It is a nonissue.I would give this camera get top marks save for this hassle factor for downloading photos. I should not have to use a workaround in the first place. Overall 4/5 because of this single issue.My only other kvetch is that auto ISO trends higher earlier than necessary. ISO 6400 is a little grainy for my taste, but certainly better than no shot at all. Grain starts at above 800. The auto ISO function is very nice, but it will go to 6400 in many situations when a far low ISO could be obtained. There are two solutions. First, I set the max ISO to 1600, which again the camera will move towards more often than not but better than 6400. I also adjusted the maximum shutter speed setting. But more than that, by and large I shoot manual to have greater ISO control, so this is not a problem.Finally, I gave this product 3/5 on price scale, but that is simply because of sticker shock coming from the D40, which I bought for $600 only 3 years ago. My D40 is now worth only $200, even though it is a great camera. My price point happens to be set lower than the market price.  Would I pay more than $1200? No. Would I pay less? Sure, if only someone would sell it to me for less than this price. When I looked, the list price was $1200 and most places were asking up to $1600 because of a short-term shortage. In a year, the price will certainly be lower.So should you pay $1200? As I said, despite being cheap, I purchased the camera and am very happy. However, mine was a discretionary purchase. My D40 is great, but I was ready to upgrade. Coming from the world of the older D40. For me, the step-up is notable.  If money is tight, then hold on a year. Alternatively, look at the D90 and other related kin which reportedly are comparable cameras. However everything is relative. For instance, if you are really penny pinching and looking for a decent DSL--go get the D40. It is a simply wonderful camera and it will serve you well. The D7000 is only if you have cash to burn.Apart from these minor complaints I am very happy with the camera. It is lightening fast, has wonderful sharpness, and has a very solid feel.As for ease of use, you can shoot out of the box. However, getting acquainted with the deeper features, the displays, and the shortcut buttons is high-yield. Videos on youtube can get you settled with the settings and buttons in 30 minutes.In summary, I looked at the glowing reviews but still wondered about a few outlying complaints. Were they real? Was there a software glitch? Were first run cameras perhaps rushed to production? In my experience, these are all non-issues. If you have hesitancies, ABT is a place to consider given their generous return policy.

I also want to paint an accurate picture of the quality that I have experienced.I have had problems with large glowing white'ish colored dots showing up randomly throughout my images.  My sensor is failing.  Wow!  That's not good.  Currently, Nikon has my camera.  When I get time, I am going to post examples on my personal website.  Hopefully Amazon will allow me to link to those images.Based upon my experience, you can expect to send this camera in every 3 months to have the sensor repaired.  You will have to pay the shipping and be inconvenienced.Bottom Line:I will not buy another Nikon product.  That's not because I think they are all bad.  Sure, you can get a lemon with any manufacturer and even the best companies will have an occasional problem.  However, how they treat the customer when problems do arise makes the difference. So, do yourself a favor and buy something another brand.Disclaimer:Prior to owning this camera, I owned a Canon 60D.  Not having owned any other DSLR's, the 60D is my single point of reference.  So, you might want to factor that into my review.About the features:I was looking for a camera to shoot indoor sports in very low light.  A full frame camera would have been even better.  But, I couldn't justify the cost.  I am using this for family photos.When working, it has good high ISO performance and focus pretty well in low light.  These two features were very important to me and the reason why I bought this camera.  When shooting low light sports indoors, you need these features.  I have had some shots outdoors in plenty of light where the focus was so far off that I was left wondering, \"what the heck was the camera thinking????\".  You could blame me for the out of focus shot.  But, in this specific case, I was using center focus aimed directly at my subject.  There was really no room for human error.  The camera simply goofed.  However, if that's not something you plan to do, I see no other compelling reason to choose this camera over any other camera.I find the menu system of the Nikon to be fair.  I like the Canon better.  To switch auto-iso on and off, you have to navigate through the menu system and then click a few times.I prefer the Canon for the buttons and the way you access shooting modes.  I also like the fold out screen on the Canon.  Before purchasing a DSLR, I owned a point and shoot with a flip out LCD.  I really liked that.  I wish the D7000 had a flip out LCD, too.  It makes self portraits (like you and friend) much easier.I think the image quality is quite good.  If you don't mind buying Adobe Lightroom, *sometimes* you can get usable photos with ISO's up to 3200 and 6400.  Honestly, I don't know if I've tried an ISO higher than 6400.  The amount of noise associated with higher ISO seems to be dependent upon the available light.  If you have decent light, higher ISO's don't seem to introduce as much noise as the same ISO in worse light.  Don't expect all of your high ISO's to come out looking sharp.  Once you get up in the range of 3200-6400, you will always want to do some noise reduction with post processing.  In the 800 to 2800 range, you're probably going to want to clean them up with post processing, too.  But, at those levels, depending upon the circumstances, you may not have much clean up to do.  FWIW, Lightroom's noise reduction works far better than Aperture's.  Apertures's is rather poor and brings my macbook pro (late 08 model) to a crawl.Shooting....the frames per second are not quite adequate for my needs.  The buffer is too small.  So, I don't get too many shots before you have to stop shooting and wait on the buffer to process some of the images.  I have to pace myself.  The Canon beats the Nikon here.  I like that the D7000 has a fine tune adjustment for lenses that consistently front or back focus.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "OMG", "Author": "B.

It only came with the body and cap and battery and charger, but I have multiples of the extras that come with the camera out of the factory (cables, straps). My model had just over 18k clicks when I got it, and in the past 4 days of owning it, I've put it to over 19k. I can't put the thing down.I was upgrading from a D5100 because I needed manual exposure controls for video, and I had heard loads of great things about this camera. I love that everything can be controlled by a button or dial. I can shoot so much faster now that I never have to navigate menus. I used to have my D5100 configured so I could change ISO, shutter speed and aperture all using the single command dial plus a button and I thought that was nice, but I didn't realize how limited I was until I got this. If I wanted to change AF modes, drive mode, white balance, metering mode, I'd have to hunt through menus. Now I can control every exposure/shooting function using only the camera's external controls and the top LCD. It's great.I know people complain about the lack of 30 fps in 1080, but let's face it; 30 fps is really only used in broadcast television, and approximately 0% of people who shoot for TV are shooting with a DSLR. Yeah, so higher frame rates would be nice for slow motion stuff, but if you are at a level where you're using features like that, chances are you know another video guy with something you can borrow for that shot. For 90% of my video needs, this camera satisfies. If you do mostly video though, maybe a Canon system would better suit your needs. Personally, it's about 80/20 photo/video for me, and this camera stretches my dollars much further than most. AF is useless for video, as expected, but most serious video people know that manual focus is the way to go while rolling anyway, so not a deal breaker whatsoever.For stills, AF is lightning fast, and is even great in low light. Silent focusing with all my AF-S lenses, and still pretty quiet on my 50 1.8 AF D as well as the couple of AF zooms I've used on it.Since I've only used this camera for a few days, I'll end it there and keep this review updated in the coming months after more use.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value for the money", "Author": "Amir Neshati", "ReviewID": "R2YR6LTKOTRDT8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good camera, noticeable improvements from a D90.

I've had it for just over two years, and it just died - apparently a shutter failure, though I'm awaiting a verdict from Nikon repair. It died at 48,000 clicks - about a third of its promised life. I treat the camera with care. Needless to say, given the original cost of this camera, I'm not at all happy.My other issue: I've had focus problems with the D7000 from the start. My old D80 had rock-solid autofocus; the D7000, even when using single-point focus, never did. So for all the professional event shoots I do, I've had to manually focus the camera. Yes, that's unacceptable, but till now (with the shutter failure), I hadn't wanted to deal with Nikon service. Now I get to see if I'm one of the lucky ones when it comes to timely repair - I'll post an update when I know.Of course, the camera has many good points, including great resolution and highly customizable settings. I love the user profiles that allow me to program all the settings I need to shoot lightning, for instance, and get there with one turn of the switch. The video is pretty, though I wish it shot 1080p at 30fps (you have to go to 720 on this camera to get that frame rate; newer models remedy this issue).  Serious video people will not like the lack of a headphone jack to monitor audio, but if you just want pretty shots, it does the job. (Especially if you don't pan too much, and if you can put it on a tripod and focus manually, because the autofocus is dreadful. At least on mine.) Having two SD card slots is awesome. The camera handles well. Battery life is terrific. There is a lot to like.  But again, dying a third of the way through its projected life, and out of warranty, is discouraging.EDIT POST-REPAIR:  I was impressed that Nikon got the camera back to me in two weeks, door-to-door. It's working very well with some heavy use, and the focus is working much better, too.  In addition to the shutter mechanism replacement, Nikon's repair center adjusted the focus and cleaned the sensor. I'm happy with the camera.EDIT Aug. 11, 2013:  Just four months after the April repair, my Nikon has died again. I've tried all the conventional resets, swapping out of battery, lenses and cards, and a firmware update, but it's making floppy sounds when I press the shutter button and has the \"ERR\" message. I am a pro and use the camera a lot, but I treat it well. It died when I was shooting photos on a tripod - it just stopped working. I'm about to try to resolve this with Nikon service, but at this point, I would NOT recommend this camera. I have downgraded the review to two stars.UPDATE Aug. 26, 2013: I have to give Nikon props for fixing the camera for free this time and getting it back to me in less than two weeks. The shutter mechanism was again replaced. Nikon's service has been good.UPDATE May 15, 2014:  For this first time since I'd had the camera repaired, I attempted to do a long exposure to shoot a rocket launch a couple of months ago and realized it had a new problem: excessive green noise in long exposures. So excessive, that at 43 seconds, the frame had turned completely green. Even with a three-second exposure, the green noise starts to appear (not just color, but noise, too). Noise reduction cannot solve the problem. I shoot a lot of lightning and night shots, and I had never seen this issue before. After a frustrating exchange with Nikon's online support, which at first suggested I just shoot shorter exposures, I've now been told it has to go back in for repair. I am considering not throwing good money after bad.

No long ago, I pulled out the D70 and the sensor had gone bad, so I returned to to NIKON up on NY and they wanted over $500 to repair.  I knew because the camera had a few years on it, I would be better off purchasing a new camera to replace the 70 instead of repairing it, so I ordered a D5100.  I guess I didn't do enough homework before the purchase was made, and found out that all my NIKKOR lens would not function as they were designed on the 5100, I was going to loose the auto focus option on the new 5100 body, so I returned the camera and upgraded to the 7000, yes it was more expensive but if I had to replace all my lens with ones that would function to their maximum potential I would spend much more than the cost difference in the two bodies.  I am so happy that I made the change.  The D7000 is one awesome camera, it is a bit heavier somewhat larger but much better construction.  I will not knock the 5100, which I believe has now been replaced with a new body.  As for the difference in the mega pix on the cameras, I don't think I will ever see a difference between the 16 meg on my 7000 vs the 24 meg pix on the 5100.

The D7000 has many features the D90 doesn't, including a truemirror lock up mode - great for long exposure night shots to reduce initialvibration when the exposure starts. (This can be done with a black reflector orbig hat, otherwise.)If you like the D90 - you'll like this. It feels very similar in weight, buildand size. Not critical for performance, but the mirror of the D7000 is *much*faster than the D90, giving the D7000 a very distinctive and sharp (not to beconfused with loud) shutter sound.One of the best features in movie mode, is that you can use manual mode forvideo. No longer do you have to endure the stepped increments of the auto-gainof the D90. It still has the same rolling shutter problems, but that can easilybe removed with the appropriate third party software later. The addition of theexternal mic jack is also appreciated. The focusing in movie mode can be madeconstant, but is still sluggish (hunting) with even the best lenses compared toa dedicated video camera. If you're serious about filming with this, it'sprobably best done in manual mode.I also like being able to set up the automatic timer mode on a tripod to shootan image every x time units.For redundancy, you can have the two card slots act as a mirror of one another,both holding identical copies of every file recorded. (A file level RAID-1)Alternatively, you configure the camera to treat the second SD card asadditional storage. (Somewhat similar to a SPAN array but at the file, not theblock, level.)Other than not recording uncompressed video (for which you'll pay a much higherprice) there's nothing I don't like about it. Sure, we could always use alarger image buffer for continuous shooting, but for most work this is notcritical. The additional focus points are nice, but again not critical.

Love the additional WB adjustments i didnt even know about especially just choosing a kelvin temperature.Can't wait to learn about and play with the more advanced adjustments available and kinda feel like i did when i first got my d40 and knew absolute nothing about photography. :)While I wasnt previously interested in video, it is pretty fun to play with HD video with nice lenses. Autofocus is pretty much useless though with video, and u really are better off just doing it manually.Got the kit for under 1k and thought I might sell the kit lens before I got it. So far I like it and will probably keep it too for now. At only 100$ more then the body alone, why not?Bought some fx lenses too with the combo discounts offered at black Friday and my next body upgrade will probably be to FF although really speaking this camera is probably all I really need.

One even had a \"cool list\" - which I found quite useful.One of my other choices (and sent back) was the D3200 among others.  The D3200 to me was plasticy and almost toyish, and had [some] useful features.  They call the D3200 an entry level camera and they mean it.  We sat around comparing hundreds of photos between the D3200 and the D7000 the other day, and the D7000's results were night/day.  I mean, REALLY jump-out-at-you noticeable.  The D7000, even though about 6 megapixels smaller (24 vs 17?) ALWAYS produces better photos - especially when blown up.  We've done a number of 3' x 5's done using raw, and the final product is awesome hanging on the wall.  We asked the print shop about the 24mp D3200 files, and after they compared a few they overwhelmingly said go with the D7000's files.  His comment was something like \"yes, some of the cheaper cameras have a higher pixel count, but we noticed a lot of the pixels were duplicated and lacked color definition - they do that to use cheap sensor technology with the bragging rights of 24mp\"And finally, the D7000 is just loaded with working features that make it a very useful tool.  Sometimes you find a camera that meets all of your needs without breaking the bank.  It's design is particularly natural - everything is where you think it should be.  It does what you think it should do.  The only negative I have with any of these high-end cameras is there's no native wifi built in.  The add-on wifi thing for the D3200 doesn't count as it's much too hokey to be useful.  It's not really wifi - if you don't believe me go get one and see.  IMHO Nikon and Canon have really dropped the ball on 802.11, but they're probably thinking #1) they don't want to be in the networking biz and #2) It'll kill the battery life.  But get a grip guys - wifi is here to stay, and it's only a matter of time before you realize it and build it into the cameras.  Go ahead, be brave and beat the other guys to the market!  (the mem card/wifi combo can be useful, but they have their own issues as they are not native to the camera)But the D7000 is a most capable camera.  The full-auto on this camera is so incredibly intelligent - it's hard to make a bad photo with it.  And when you want it to bend over backwards, you can modify it with manual controls in 10mil ways.

I just wanted to add a few thoughts from the perspective of someone who is not a pro but has been a serious hobbyist.  I've owned the D50 and D90 and this one blows them away.  The primary thing that I am impressed with is the Scene Mode shooting.  I have previously been someone who might fiddle around with adjusting EV to get a more saturated picture, or even tried to fiddle with white balance a time or two.  I often wound up shooting in P mode because I could make and keep my own adjustments.This camera out-thinks me on every shot.  Shoot a landscape without putting it in landscape mode and it's fine.  Dial up Landscape on the Scene dial and it's more saturated with more dense colors--just a better looking shot.  Shoot indoors without a flash and into a room with at least 3 different types of lighting--halogens, incandescents, floods--and it perfectly balances the different light types--you can even see one light is slightly orange, another very white--and you still get great flesh tones.  I think my days of fiddling are over.  The scene modes think and work better than I do.I love this thing.  It lets me get back to concentrating on the shot and making as good pictures as I can, rather than fiddling with technicalities.

Gillies", "ReviewID": "R2H89MF3RGXK1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ended up buying a slightly used but almost new one on e-Bay because they were not available at Amazon at the time and since I live abroad I saved quite a bit on duty on a used item vs a new one. In any case it is a very very nice camera with more features than I know how to use. My previous camera was a D70 so it was a bit of an upgrade. If you are just going to buy a couple of modern zooms such as the 18-200mm VR or the 18-105mm VR or only lenses with built in focus motors then I would buy the D5100. But if you are an old guy like me who is used to film cameras then the D7000 is really great with the older manual focus lenses. I have a nice Vivitar series one zoom (version 3 by Komine) and it works very well with the D7000. I also have the Nikon 16-85mm VR and the Nikon 70-300mm VR but I think aside from these two I will use older AIS lenses since they are available for very reasonable prices. I don't really mind manual focus vs AF but I do like VR since when you are older you can't hold the camera as still as you would like and you miss too many shots if you have to set up a tripod. All of Nikon's dslr's take nice pictures but if you want the maximum selection of lenses then buy the D7000. The D7000 also has many features that I still need to learn about since I have only had the camera about a month. I used to have a Nikon 18-105mmVR that was stolen along with my D70. In spite of it's plastic mount which many people don't like, but it took very nice pictures. I am a big fan of modern digital cameras but I don't like the point and shoot cameras. If my budget was very limited I would buy a good used D40 and the 18-105mm VR which would take way better pictures than any point and shoot. In any case I was very surprised how well the D7000 works with older AIS lenses which is something not mentioned too much in the other reviews. This is something to seriously consider when deciding whether or not to buy the D7000.  I also considered an FX camera but with an FX camera you start spending too much money for just a hobby and the D7000 takes very nice pictures that will make the great majority of users very happy. Also the high ISO of the D7000 makes up for not having an FX to a great extent. The only thing the D7000 lacks is built in VR which would be a useful feature as many lenses don't have it. Built in VR is the one thing that might tempt me to upgrade from the D7000.  Update:  I've been looking at the reviews of the new Pentax K5. It seems to have the same ISO performance of the D7000. By having a built in anti-shake mechanism you can save quite a bit on lenses with the K5. For example the Nikon 70-210mm F2.8 VR costs more than the K5 and the Tamron 80-200 F2.8 put together. If the D7000 had built-in VR you could save well over a thousand dollars on one lens alone. I guess Nikon wants to make money selling VR lenses.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great DX camera", "Author": "Govis", "ReviewID": "R34BDM8JX1JGTW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent performing DX camera.  This camera, while likely fine for a beginner, will be more helpful for a more advanced photographer who can grasp a lot of its features. It has multiple ways of tweaking options and camera functions.  It has two user customizable modes that allow you to reliably reproduce your favorite camera setups with just the twist of a mode dial.  There is a user customizable \"My Menu\" feature so you can find you most often used options, like for instance Auto-ISO (which adjusts the ISO so your shutter speed never falls below a preset that you have set).The D7000 is a revelation in High ISO performance compared to my D200; even with pixel peeping, well exposed ISO 3200 pictures take minimal chroma noise reduction to look extremely clean.  I think this D7000 is at least 2 stops better than my D200 and at least 4 stops better than my Canon S95 point and shoot. Related to this, it has great dynamic range when shot in RAW.Autofocus and flash performance are excellent as far as I am concerned.  It has a wireless flash commander mode, which is very useful for speedlight owners.  The Nikon flash system is quite excellent and flexible, I find.  Couple flashes with the excellent higher ISO performance, and you can really maximize what you are able to light with flash.The body itself seems well built, though there is a bit of flex in the hand grip portion.Minimal complaints, other than the grip flex and perhaps the metering blows highlights a little too readily.I definitely recommend it for Nikon DX users, certainly for those upgrading cameras that are more than a generation old, like my D200.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "best value dslr", "Author": "dwest", "ReviewID": "R3M6JQMDVS6QYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is dollar for dollar the best value of any dslr on the market.

I took it out of the box, charged the battery and left on a 3 week holiday to Europe with the 18-200mm attached and 2 cards, one in each slot. No extra flash, no gadgets, no back-up battery, no manual and no back-up camera. I'm coming off a D60 which was an overall great camera.I probably took 1500 pictures in 3 weeks in every lighting situation and all kinds of weather including, yes, rain. I also used all modes and all scenery configurations. I did not shoot video and I rarely if ever used the flash. Excluding my mistakes, every single picture was sharp, rich and clear. Even at high noon, into the sun, the fast shutter gives you decent pictures.I'm just an amateur when it comes to photography but this camera, with this lens, is just unbelievable. I struggle with the idea that $2K got me this incomparable camera AND the 18-200 lens...how can you beat that?Everything in this camera can be adjusted to suit the user including the flash speed. The Scene modes are brilliant. The light modes are 100% accurate. The menus are incredibly detailed. You can sort pictures in files or by day or week or any other way you want. You can edit pictures on-screen, trim them, experiment with them and then save or delete them. You can shoot RAW or jpeg. You get live mode, a video cam, a real camera body, not plastic. You can use any lens ever built by Nikon. AF is awesome. You can shoot in the dark and in the rain.With regards to the battery, you get a cord and an adapter that plugs right into the wall socket...corded or cord-less...forget the cord and stick to the adapter. WRT battery life, I couldn't get over how long a charge lasts and yes, you can check the status of the battery as well as it's age via the menu. You can easily take 500 pictures on a charge, no problem at all.You also get a USB cable, video cables and Nikon software, the ViewNX2 for Windows or Mac....basic but decent.In short, this is a camera for someone who is interested in photography and wants to take better pictures.

Absolutely loving it.  If you're looking for a good advanced amateur camera, it's worth considering.The control layout is convenient and makes it easy to get to all of the adjustments you want to make.  If you're the kind of photographer who regularly assumes control of ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and uses various options like mirror lockup, and only occasionally will use a \"scene mode,\" this is very convenient.  If on the other hand you're the type who likes the camera to make most of the decisions and only occasionally wants to assume full control, you might prefer something like the D3100 or D5000.  The photos will be nearly as good; what you're getting is convenience and some upgraded features on the D7000.Image quality is excellent, and the camera includes some new features, like the ability to autocorrect lens distortion.  When matched with a modern Nikon lens, the D7000 receives information that allows it to automatically adjust pincushion and barrel distortion.  It's convenient and works pretty well.  If you're shooting RAW mode and plan to enter a contest, I'd say making your own adjustments in Photoshop is better.  But if you're on a more casual shoot, it's a nice feature to switch on to save a lot of processing work later.Whatever camera you buy, make sure you purchase a good lens.  I would recommend buying only the body, and then getting good glass.  If you're on a limited budget, a $600 lens on a $600 camera is better than a $200 lens on a $1000 camera.The one downside of the D7000 is the video performance.  It's a cute gimmick, but honestly, SLR's just aren't ideal for video, at least not with today's technology.  I don't really care, as I don't use video much.

Video, though not seamlessly perfect, serves its job well too. You may not be able to get astonishingly sharp pictures if you use it with its 18-105 mm kit lens.

Anyway.I love it my D7000! Nothing beats this camera for the price. I gave it 4 stars because unfortunately there is no \"perfect\" camera. The fact is that newer technology most of the time brings more bugs with it. 16MP is already high enough, personally i dont need anything higher than that, i don't even have it set to 16MP, i usually put it in 9MP or lower. I don't print LARGE prints, and i certainly don't get paid for it.Anyway, the reason why i have posted this info is to let everyone that owns a D7000 to try something that i read in an online forum. I just followed what they said, reset EACH menu settings WITHIN the menus in the camera and do a couple other simple things. I just did it myself right before i typed this info for you and i will test my camera within the next couple of days, starting today, and i will post the results of this simple procedure. By the way, this information was given by a Nikon Technician. Here is the short and simple procedure, Good luck everyone i hope it works and please post your comments to see the overall results. Here you go:Reset all and EACH of the menu system to default settings. Then turned off the camera. While off,  press the two green buttons at the same time Holding them down, use another finger to turn the camera on. The camera will then blink after two seconds, then shut it back off while holding down the buttons(basically you never let go of the two green buttons).UPDATE AS OF 6/8/2012:After performing the above reset, I have ALSO calibrated all my lenses with AF Fine Tuning and it looks like it really worked!! I am very happy, i have been testing the camera for about two days so far, and focusing the same way i was before when getting the back focusing, and so far it looks VERY VERY GOOD. The camera seems to be focusing exactly where it should be compared to before, i am seeing a BIG diffence specially in low light. This is very good news!  Bottom line:  Even if you do all the above you still HAVE to know which AF setting AND metering mode you have to use depending on what scenario you are in.

As I have invested thousands of US dollars in Nikon lenses I am married to the Nikon System.  My previous Nikon was a D90 that was stolen New Year's Day, with the recent price drop due to the D7100 coming I took the opportunity to get the D7000.  The extra $450 US I saved allowed me to get a Nikon 24mm f/2.8D lens and Meike vertical grip as well as a generic wired remote cable, all for the price of the body only D7100.If you are reading this you are in one of two camps, a current Nikon owner looking to upgrade current DSLR or someone looking to get into digital photography for the first time/getting a gift for someone else.  If you are a current Nikon owner you know most of the features and advances the D7000 offers.  For you the question is if the price difference between this and the D7100 is worth it.  The first run of D7000 was plagued by oil splatter on the image sensor and quality control issues with the AF system.  My D7000 bought in January 2013 had all the current firmware installed right out of the box but had a serious back focus issue.  I took it into Nikon for repair and they fixed it in 20 minutes with a software upload.  I am sure the first run of the D7100 will have some bugs to be worked out and reviewers are just starting to get their D7100's now.  The D7100 has many advantages but the price is still high for \"entry level\" grade bodies.  I personally rather save the money and use it towards lenses that will last me many future generations of camera bodies.For those looking to enter into the Nikon DSLR world or getting a gift for someone this is an excellent choice.  For new users you will need to have a good basic foundation for photography and the controls needed to get great photos.  This is a huge jump from point and shoots and the number, placement, and function of the controls can be overwhelming at first.  If you have used 35mm film SLR cameras in the past it will be an easier translation.  The D7000 has one issue needing to be known before getting.  It is a high resolution and contrast camera.  This requires better technique and control over the camera to get the best results.  The D7000 is a serious camera and to get great pictures out of it you have to seriously use it.For those getting this for someone else the biggest thing to understand is this camera is just a piece of a larger more comprehensive system.  This means there are lenses, flashes, and accessories to expand photography well beyond snapshots.  The kit lenses are good for a start but the curiosity to expand into the hundreds of available lenses and accessories will soon take hold.  This is an excellent camera that will serve anyone well but does require a level and degree of photography knowledge to use well.  There are users who complain of image quality with this camera.  Many of these are due to user error or lack of proper techniques but there is an issue with the auto focus system on some cameras.  I experienced this and contacted Nikon who fixed the issue for free without any issues.  I do recommend the camera but I can't rate it at 4 or 5 stars due to the AF back focus issue.  For everything else this is a solid 5/5 star camera that will last for years and provide plenty of creative room to express your vision any way you like.  The only real upgrade from this camera is full frame or FX format.  For the most part this is academic unless you are using photography for a living.

I purchased the nikkor 55-300 and the nikkor 18-55mm zooms with it. Great if you have enough light, not so great in darker situations but hey, it's always great to have something to upgrade. So a little later I ordered a 35mm f1.8 and this is truly stunning.Especially in videomode I shot scenes with 'natural light' using nothing but street lamps as light sources at ISOs around 1000 and the videos look absolutely fantastic. I never got close to these results in comparable conditions using videocameras costing more than five times as much as this camera does. For stills at higher ISOs it really depends on what you shoot, though.For shooting video it is a little light so you need to find a way of stabilizing the camera if you want a movie feel. Plus, if you are into video, you need to buy some nd filters with it so you can shoot wide open in bright daylight, it makes a huge difference. Check youtube for great free tutorials on how to get the movie look using DSLRs.One disadvantage when shooting video is that you usually want to focus manually and can only do so using the display (obviously) which makes it hard in bright daylight to get the focus spot on.The camera body is quite small and light compared to the pro level DSLRs.I love the camera and take it everywhere with me.

While the resolution increase isn't huge, it will give you more room for cropping later and making slightly larger prints.  But the features that sold me were the high ISO performance, 14bit raw captures and dual card slots (even if they're SD).The high ISO performance has not disappointed.  1600 ISO doesn't look a lot noisier than 400 ISO on the D200.  And true to their promise, shots at 6400 ISO are usable, so long as you don't get carried away in the size of your prints or display.Likewise, the 6 fps frame rate seems pretty well on target in real world shooting.  There are faster cameras in Nikon's stable, but none come to mind at this price point.The dual card slots are great, even if they have me selling off my compact flash cards.  I purchased two 16GB class 10 cards by Transcend here on Amazon: they appear to be up to both shooting stills and HD video.  The camera allows you to set up the cards for overflow, backup or separate by file type.

But despite where Nikon positioned it in their lineup, this is an upgrade to any other DX body including the D300S in some ways, and is a bargain at it's current price of $1,200, in my opinion.While it's handy to be able to shoot video, and the full-time focus seems to work well, the focus motor from your camera/lens will make a lot of noise unless you're using a remote microphone.

The camera, itself, has some wonderful features.  Having the second slot for overflow or RAW/JPEG usage is a bonus. The new dial puts frequently used settings at your fingertips that used to require going into the menu.  Being able to save settings for either two people using the camera, or, in my case, personal preferences used in different situations is a slick idea.  Those Nikon people were thinking when they designed this camera body.  However, when I received my D7000, I was disappointed in a few things.  First of all, I shoot in RAW and the first thing I needed to do was upgrade my Photoshop.  The Camera RAW from CS3 would not open the files from the D7000.  Then, I found that my 3 year old MAC would not allow me to upgrade to CS6 without a system upgrade from Leopard.  Fine.  I suppose we all need to keep current.  But the real disappointment was after doing all of this,  I reviewed my images from the D7000, and found they were very noisy.  This camera was priding itself on being of superior quality at high ISO's, but anything 400 ISO and above had too much noise.  I've seen better quality coming from phone cameras.  I found the quality in my older D90 was better at the same ISO.  So, after many back and forth emails from NIKON's tech support, trying to figure out if there was possibly a setting that was wrong, and getting nowhere, I finally called and talked to a real person.  He decided, after reviewing my images, that the camera was defective.  Now, I have passed my 30 day return policy with Amazon because I wasted time trying to fix this by email, but (and this is why I LOVE Amazon.com) they made a one time exception after hearing my story, and they sent me a replacement camera.  I was thrilled.  But the replacement camera is not much better.  There is still too much noise, and I'm finding that the sharpness is not there like I had with my D90.  I tested photographing the same subject, same settings, same lens, and found a sharper image came from the D90.

But for the \"crop sensor\" shooter looking for great performance this is arguably the best option.Technically its sensor is the highest rated (DxO Labs) but in practice I don't see dramatic or even noticeable differences in image quality between this or any other current DSLR camera.  They all capture great images.  What the D7000 does that sets it apart from lower end models is: 1). Meters & Focuses accurately and instantaneously and 2). Offers every conceivable adjustment at your fingertips.  There is no waiting around for 1/8 second for a focusing light to \"beep\" because depressing the shutter release handles that instantaneously.  And the ergonomics keeps digging into menus to a minimum.IMAGE QUALITY vs. D5100 or D3100:  No difference.  At most its sensor gives you about 1/3 f/stop compared to the D3100 that I don't consider significant.LENSES MAKE THE DIFFERENCE: A good \"walk-around\" lens would be Nikon's 18-105vr that gives good zoom range for most shots and delivers very good IQ with adequate light.  The best images can be captured with Nikon's 35mm 1.8G or their 50mm 1.8G.CONS:  Size- It is bigger and heavier than a D5100 or Canon T3i.  For some the smaller size/weight could be an advantage.  Personally I miss the smaller size of the D3100 that I consider the best value in high quality DSLR cameras based on image quality, ergonomics and its Guide Mode for beginners.  Cost- The D7000 is an excellent value at its current price but the value shopper wanting to spend less might look at the outstanding D5100 body only (same sensor as D7000) or the D3100 with 18-55vr for just under five hundred dollars.

The initial body that I received had massive problems to focus with any of my 6 Nikon lenses, even the new 50mm 1.8G. After initially attributing the poor focus of all my pictures taken to my lack of experience with the camera, I eventually learned from series of test shots that the camera had a massive back focus problem. After exchanging the body for a new one at least one of my 6 lenses (35mm 1.8G) would correctly focus, all others had to be manually calibrated with AF fine tuning. While this process works in principal, I reject to notion that after spending $1.200 on a camera I would have to do so by default. It further tells me that the D7000 no longer is a camera in the league of a D90, which also allowed an hobbyist/enthusiast - consumer to take decent photographs. Thus said, the D7000 largely receives good reviews from professional photographers who know how to calibrate their lenses or people who deny that a $1,200 Nikon could be a bad product.I urge everyone owning a D90 to hold on to it, as I wished I never had sold mine.P.S.

Would rather see this camera without the video capability and reduce the cost.- No built in PC-sync adapter (would have preferred that over the GPS capability).- Have come across an intermittent issue with autofocus in live view where camera won't lock focus correctly.- RAW format uses full 16.2 megapixels so files are huge (would be nice to see an option that allows you to choose how many megapixels you want to use when shooting RAW).I noticed this camera has a Q mode (Quiet shutter release), which apparently is to silence the shutter noise.  I like the idea of this especially when photographing weddings since during the ceremony it's almost dead silent and the camera's shutter noise and the high pitch noise of the flash unit re-energizing itself can be heard by those you're standing next to, but the shutter speed appears to be affected when in this mode. It's slower, so I won't end up using it.Update:Just started messing around with the video more and found that my camera is among the many now that have the dead pixel issue.  I tried recording in low light and noticed 2 dead pixels (one green, one blue).  Then I tried recording in better lighting and could still see the green pixel.  Between the dead pixel issue and autofocus noise, the video capability is more annoying than anything.  Because of this I reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4.  Also, Nikon has released an update to its firmware on this camera (sorry don't have the link) which they claim helps reduce the dead pixel issue.

Since those are by far the most important topics for a DSLR, I gave the D7000 4-stars (admittedly only after a week's use, so I'm still learning the camera)..Since image uploads to Amazon are so small, I created two, test images, one with a magnification loop over a cat's eye in the hope that you can see the detailed structure in the iris. Actually, too much detail, I'd probably soften the image if I used it..The general user interface is also improved. I particularly like the addition of a shutter-mode dial, and two custom settings (U1 and U2) on the dial..On the negative side, the overall Nikon UI needs to be reinvented. When you have to hit the ISO button to turn the volume off when checking video capture in a quiet setting, you know you're trying to squeeze too many functions onto too many physical buttons..The top LCD is an antiquated left-over. It's extremely hard to read in any light, and squeezes in too much information. My suggestion: Replace it with a simple LED read out for basic exposure info, and put everything else on the back, perhaps using soft-buttons on screen..The D7000 also does not play well with others. Inability to simply plug the D7000 into a USB port and read the SD cards as drives (rather than trying to force us to use the bad ViewNX sw) is unacceptable. Nikon's own CaptureNX didn't upgrade to read D7000 NEF files right away, even though Apple's Aperture already had them..The video is improved but suffers from being buried in the standard Nikon hierarchical menus. You should be able to go to video mode and have all the video options pop up on the rear screen. I haven't yet tested video with rapid motion (I want to use the D7000 for selected sporting event video w/telephoto), but fear the old diagonal slicing is still there, from reading reviews..Nikon's support is good up to a point, but arrogantly refuses to even recognize existence of Aperture, Photoshop, etc. That's simply unacceptable..A smaller nit: The autofocus light is much brighter, but that actually makes it more intrusive (one person thought it was a flash!). And since turning it off is again time consuming, I find myself using manual focusing on the D7000 in situations where I would use auto on my older D90.

Not too many DSLR's can offer that kind of diversity with relatively little user input.I Love this camera and will only like it better as I become more familiar with all the settings and options.Nikon D7000 16.2MP DX-Format CMOS Digital SLR with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only)", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "I can grow into this", "Author": "aldante", "ReviewID": "R1WHB1DT39QBAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off everyone should know that I am pretty new to photography.  I started with point and shoots and recently purchased the Canon T2i in order to get more options. That model is a nice camera.  However I was very disappointed with the 18-55 kit lens, its exposure compensation, metering and focus points.  My friend told me about the d7000.  While it was $400 (for comparable equipment) more I took back my Canon and purchased the Nikon.The d7000 is so much more camera. While I have not explored its video abilities I have taken about 1100 shots with it and I love it.  First off the 18-105mm \"kit lens\" is very good. I also purchased a package with the 70-300mm vr dx....very very nice.  The exposure compensation is accurate. 39 focus points along with an incredible array of how to use them with autofocus choices.  I prefer Nikon colors and the this camera does a great job. JPEGs are high quality as well as the RAW files.  There is a lot to learn for me but straight out of the camera the shots are great.  The included editing software is perfect for me.  I had a little learning curve (much more then the T2i) but in reality I was able to use this camera functionally with in a week or so.**update**I have had two significant events since I first purchased this camera. 1st I sent it back to Nikon for slight backfocus issues. This was a massive disappointment and I was upset.  2nd since it has been back I am awestruck by the power of this camera.  I did not know what I was doing with this camera and the results were the same as a much less expensive dslr. Now that I have taken the time to experiment (about 3200 snaps) and understand the intricate focus and metering choices I am only now beginning to get some really steller shot....shots that I had hoped to get with this major purchase.  I am so pleased with the body and the 18-105mm - 70-300mm that I purchased a tripod and remote.  The high iso performance is incredible, the software is very easy to understand, and nikon support has been wonderful to me since I called with questions. The focus is just so perfect, the dynamic range of colors and detail is great.

I decided to go big so I'm not limited by options in the future. I know some people say not to because it's dumb to do, I beg to differ. I learn stuff really quick. In the few hours I played with it I was getting close to pro shots with it. I did however spend my days on YouTube watching tutorial videos until it came of course.This camera is great, heavy (A little over 3 pounds with lens on it), but great. The D7000 does everything I need to do, although I find myself needing a macro lens because the 18-200mm is not good enough for close up shots, I mainly do landscape anyway. Though I like to do a lot of close up photography was wishing I had a macro lens the whole time. So if that is what you like to do then look into the Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 SLD DG Macro Lens with built in motor for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras for a cheaper alliterative.This camera is also weather sealed. But NOT waterproof. So this means DO NOT GET IT  WET!To keep this review short: I really love this camera, but you will find yourself wanting to spend more on lenses. If you can afford this camera than get it.I wouldn't bother with buying an ESC for your camera either. You can get your homeowner's insurance to cover it and you're protected against more than you would be with an ESC.As for how many photos you can take:I always take my images on the highest setting.With 32GB of memory you can get 1,000 photos.With JPEG+RAW you can get about 400.Maybe get two 128GB SD cards and put them into the camera. That should have you set for a long time.You should have maybe 2-3 extra batteries also if you're taking this places also where you're unable to charge.You should be able to get around 800 shots per battery.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "prash_142", "ReviewID": "R2ZVYYT0TRAND8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in July and am very happy with the features..

FYI:- I graduated from D40x and mind you that was an amazing camera for beginners and I had it for nearly 5-years and it did serve me well. Now that I'm finally ready to get serious with my hobby I can take it to the next level. I especially like the low light photography of D7000 where my D40x fell short several times.I must say there's bit of learning curve to the D7000 if you are moving up from say D40x (like myself). D7000 is considered entry level professional camera (I think) even though it is a DX body...I bough this camera mainly because I had my daughters 1st birthday last weekend. We had a party indoors and I did not want to get any bad pics because of the camera. I must say that I'm impressed by the pictures that I took they are significantly better than any I've taken with my D40x (I'm not bashing D40x but just saying that I'm glad I upgraded to D7000).I chose D7000 over D3100 & D5100 since I was looking for a great camera not a camera+camcorder since we have 2 smartphones that take phenomenal video with enough clarity to play on our TV/Laptop/Youtube uploads etc...Both the D3100 & D5100 compared to D7000 and marginal step above D40x (besides video). The myriad of features that D7000 has and its customization options are a definite plus..D3100:- Besides being cheaper, lighter and smaller form factor there's not much to say about D3100 over D7000 as both are not in same league so to speak...So I eliminated D3100 right from the start...D5100:- D5100 is pretty decent compared to D7000 but then again I think as a camera falls behind D7000. Few plus points for D5100 over D7000 are the in camera HDR & easy to use flip out screen + being thinner & lighter. Since I post process all of my pics at which point I can play with HDR toning using post processing tools. I can create HDR later and don't need in the camera also its hard to confirm that you got a great picture using the 3\" LCD screen so in camera HDR is not exactly a huge plus.Any way these are only my first impressions so far. I will update once I use the camera for a while before I can truly see what wonder this cool camera has to offer...PS: D7000 has in built auto focus motor (A REALLY REALLY BIG PLUS) for my existing 2 amazing non motorized Nikkor lenses. The price for a non motorized lens is much reasonable compared to the motorized from what I have seen so far.---------------Edit: 07/10/2012What can I say after using it for little over a month, I've not regretted so far even for a minute. I can almost say that D7000 sometimes makes me feel like I'm a Pro after a bit of processing my pictures.There's a bit of learning curve in terms of manual controls compared to D40x. However, the inbuilt functions do give you spectacular images just so you can use a great camera whenever there's a moment that has to be captures.I still am using lenses from the ones I got when I purchased my D40x back in 2007. Also, last year I unknowingly purchased non compatible (non-motorized) lenses before (buying D7000). Now those lenses (mostly portrait lenses) are working perfectly with D7000 since it has built in motor. So suddenly my previous investments (in lenses) came to full life with little effort or not miss the shot of the perfect moment...**Amazing step up from D40x in low light situation - one of my gripes with D40x besides being non-motorized**------------Here's a link of the pictures that have pictures from both D40x & D7000------------[...]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you didn't already hear, this is a great camera.", "Author": "J. Carrow", "ReviewID": "R1MH734YG5PS2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a Nikon D40 for about four years, and finally upgraded to the D7000 in advance of a long trip I'm taking.This review concentrates on what's different between the D7000 and the D40. That might sound strange since they're so different, but I think that it's a common upgrade- I bought my D40 to get my feet wet, took tens of thousands of pictures, and started bumping into the camera's limits on occasion, and learning to operate in those limits.To compare the D7000 to the D40, first I will give you the 'cons'-It's heavier and larger. You notice this when you carry it around. I could throw my D40 and kit lens in my bag and forget it's there.-It seems more prone to having the memory card door pop open. It might just be me, and maybe my hands will get more used to it, but I seem to accidentally dislodge the door and the little rubber plug near the battery door on a regular-ish basis when I'm pulling the camera out of my bag.-It's a little harder to set up. What do you expect? It's a lot more camera, and I don't do manuals.-The battery is slower to charge, and doesn't seem to last any longer.-The fancy AF system can be confusing if you're used to always using one point to focus and recompose.These 'cons' could just be my whining at no longer having my trusty familiar camera in my hand, and having to learn something new again instead of concentrating purely on the images.Some 'pros' compared to the D40:-The low light quality is leaps and bounds better. I hesitated to shoot the D40 at ISO 1600, and now I am willing to shoot at 3200 with the D7000. Even 6400 can give nice shots, and the HI-2 (equivalent of 25,600) can give very usable shots if you don't mind heavily post processing them and only using them reduced to web sizes.-The metering is noticeably better, so I have to adjust the exposure less, and have fewer blown highlights.-The viewfinder is larger, so its easier to see what you're doing.-The auto white balance has a much wider range of correction, and is more accurate. In difficult mixed indoor/outdoor lighting, I feel like I have a real shot at getting colors right with this camera. Even if the 'auto' isn't infallible, the adjustments are much easier to tweak, and have more range.-The dynamic range is great. I'm not sure if it's the Auto-ADR or something else, but I have been getting some great shots. As an example, I have somebody indoors with a bright light streaming in from the sun outside, and nasty overhead lights, and I am now able to much more reliably get shots that show her face with a nice soft graduation of light instead of looking posterized.One other thing to mention is that I've compared the D7000 to the D700 briefly, and I will say that the D700 still seems to be the superior camera. It feels better in the hand, the viewfinder is bigger, and you can read all over the internet about technical stuff that people will argue makes one better than another. In my eyes the D700 is better. Is it $1,000 better? Maybe, maybe not. If you're in the market, I'd say to go get your hands on both.In closing, you may want to know if I am I getting rid of my D40. Heck no! I couldn't sell it for much anymore due to its age, but it's still reliable and makes great pictures.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera - when it works", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"ANM\"", "ReviewID": "RX8B036BJCLW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really great pictures - when the camera is working.

I was greatly please with my purchase but, I quickly out grew the camera.  I mostly shoot sports and fast action photography so the D3100 put to many limts because of the low FPS.

The part that meets the body of the camera is completely made of plastic. Heck, almost the entire lens is plastic minus the glass. I don't know how this will hold up over time and to me this is a big mistake on Nikons part. The lens is terribly cheap and appears poorly constructed when closely examined. Upon reading reviews of the kit lens, several people have mentioned broken or cracked plastic over time. I would buy the Body only version and pick up another lens.3. The neck strap is very cheap. This is not the Wide high quality version. It is about 1.5-2 inches wide, and just feels really cheap, stiff, and thin. (not important but FYI)Besides these things, everything else has been beaten to death in other reviews. The camera is absolutely wonderful, takes great pictures, and the low light performance is amazing.I would say though that the focusing during video mode is a tad behind that of Canons T3i, T2i, 60d, etc.This is a great camera still!

Far better than any of the prosumer video cameras in this price range I have used quality is fantastic.As far as pictures, I am still putting the camera through it's paces, but so far it has not disappointed in that area either, the clarity and color are wonderful so far. The autofocus is quick in most lighting conditions(worthless when shooting video though). The shutter is quiet as well. Now, addressing the title of the review: I added the if you can use it because a lot of the more negative reviews tend to reference downfalls that only occur when using one of the auto or program modes. If you are an aspiring pro, or even hobbyist really, you should rarely, if ever, use a scene or program mode. There's a reason this camera has almost twice as many buttons/knobs/what-have-you than the D5000: you are meant to use them!In conclusion, this is a great camera for those looking to step up from an entry level DSLR or for one who is looking to come from film but you're not willing to drop $2k on a more expensive camera.

I enjoy hiking and travel and this camera has all the capabilities to make any shots. For the SLR novice it takes less than 10 minutes to get started. What else can one ask for? Nikon has done an exceptional job with the 4 page insert to get one started that came with my camera kit. The manual that comes with the camera is exceptionally logical arranged and serves as a great learning manual to become familiar with all the functions and possibilities. Key for me is to read on a feature and right away put it into action.My camera came with the 18mm to 200mm AF-S Nikkor GII ED VR for DX format cameras. It's a one lens solution for me allowing pictures in a small room at wide angle and for some telephoto needs. This lens is versatile. Even though I did purchase the fixed focus 50mm f/1.8 D AF lens because of the shutter speeds it allows at low light (no flash) and for the depth of focus control (like taking a picture of a blossom while the rest of the background is blurred at apperture 1.8 for example).It helps to understand a few physical concepts or to be teachable, but the camera is really for anyone interested in photography at a somewhat more interesting level. I think this camera is suitable even for beginners if interested in what SLR cameras can offer. Some of the 2 star reviews speak for themselves.I took some amazing pics within the first 24 hours which are simply not doable with point and shoot cameras. I have not tested the video on this camera, because I did not purchase the camera for that.

I carried over the Nikon 18-200vr, 50mm 1.8 and 35mm 1.8 from my old D40.Photos:I been shooting this camera since the first week of November 2010 and have taken about 4000 shots/some movie clips.  At first I thought the image was a little soft.  The poster on this d7000 forum told me how to fixed it in the menu and all is fine now.  I am finally getting night shots, when I did night photo stroll with my friends the D40 was too slow and my iso skill back then wasn't great.  Since I gotten this I played with almost every buttons and setting and actually shot aperture priority now, I been using the Nikon present for the D40.Movies mode:I am still learning this, getting things to focus on the fly.  It does continuous autofocusing, but not as zippy as the Sony A33 I played with.  Overall the movies I made are fun, but in no way anything you see on blu-ray 1980x1080p.  I find that I do a better job of manual focus and it is much quieter.  I plug an external microphone to this and it really is a benefit to filming with audio for less background noise.Positives:+Great photos, Sony newest CMOS is good for low lighting.+Camera Body motor, I have a 50mm 1.8 that I can finally use.+ISO looks very good, once I leave 1600, I can notice some different+more external buttons, entry level camera like the D40 uses the submenu too much.+Bigger body and sturdier magnesium alloy material, I like that in my hands with the rubber insert.+LCD screen is much improved, now I do know if a shot is good or bad.+Live view photography, I don't use it much but I like the option too.+Nikon Service, I called about the stuck pixel in Movie mode, they said wait for the firmware, and it got fixed.+Nikon ViexNX is good for quick adjustment.+1080p 24fps Movie mode with continuous auto-focus(like I said not as zippy as Sony, but much quieter) I made a few youtube videos now.Neutral:Battery is bigger and more expensive then before.  I Since I record clip more it is hard to compare to the D40 which just took pictures.  I get 350-400 shots before I recharge.  Some people claim 1000 shots per charge, but that is not me.  My 4000shot hashas 5-6 charges already.Negative:-GPS, if the Sony A55 with the same cmos as this can have one for cheaper, why not the D7000.-I was hoping it be around $1000.  The Sony A33 and A55 are much cheaper, with the same cmos.Overall I like the pictures that I got from the D7000, and all the external layout.  I can bracket shots with ease, for HDR editing photoshop of course.  I don't have to go into the submenu to turn on the remote.  I even used the continuous burst for once.  The Nikon ViexNX is a good software for quick fix like for contrast and sharpening.  It is no way a Lightroom or Photoshop replacement, nope.  It can edit video too, but I just use the Window Media player on Win7.  I have/carried this camera around me like a cellphone.  I added the Nikon SB-700 to this camera and the two work well together, ie the wireless flash. Is the 18-105 lens worth 300, if you don't have any lens(es) yes.  It is an acceptable walk-around lens with a decent zoom an ok 3.5 at 10 and 5.6 when you zoom to the 105.  Later on maybe get some faster lenses (bigger glass and aperture) like a zoom f2.8 or either a 35 or 50mm prime f1.8 or for more bokeh.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Totally UnExpected Awesomenessss!", "Author": "Apple Jacki \"Jack\"", "ReviewID": "R1M26V895DY1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The body, the features, and the end results, STILL IMAGES, are totally awesome.

The quality of images is great. I have been taking pictures with D7000 for 3 years and would give 5 stars for its photo capabilities and image quality. I also shot a few videos with this DSLR, and did not like the audio, especially when recording music. I know I am not going to skew the average rating of D7000 by giving it 3 stars, but I hope this will flag the review to help alter the problematic audio of this camera. As many are aware, the audio of the movie provides over half of the overall impressions of the movie.Quite a few reviewers mentioned the poor sound from the D700 that can be described as \"tiny\", not loud enough, having significant noise, and sometimes distorted (slow reacting auto gain?). It is commonly suggested to use an external microphone and place it off camera to improve the sound and eliminate the focusing noise. You can further improve the sound by connecting a directional mic first to a personal recorder which you would, in turn, connect to the D7000. The sound will still be limited by the capabilities of the D7000 recording module, which was reported to record sound in the meager, 150-5000 Hz range. Please find the link to that report by the Finnish magazine, Tekniikan Maailma (World of Technology). in the comment below this review. With this rigging, you will have an improved, although still phone-like, sound matched with the video. Capturing the sound with a quality recorder and syncing the audio with the footage in the post can ensure an ultimate adudio. I explored a few options and chose the Sennheiser MKE 600 directional mic ($330) and Sony PCM M10 portable recorder ($225-250) to improve my D7000 audio, especially when shooting video of quiet music recitals at some distance from the performer. I compared the above Sennheiser mic with 2 cheaper Bronstein shotgun microphones side by side. The former sounded pretty good even when plugged directly in the camera, and the Bronstein mics were too quiet (although I tried one of them on a Sony camcorder, and it worked well). When I am using the Sony recorder (instead of or in combination with an external mic), I connect the recorder to the camera with a 35 dB attenuation cable so the sound is not clipped in D7000. This produces a relatively good sound in-camera, and I am still getting a copy of a better audio in the recorder as an option for post processing. The direction of the attenuation cable must be observed or the sound will be ruined. A recorder's built-in omnidirectional stereo mics (instead of a shotgun) will also greatly improve the sound, but a shotgun mic will help isolate the intended sound and suppress side/back noise. To hear how the audio sounds when recorded with D7000, Sony PCM M10, Sennheiser and 2 Bronstein mics (connected to camera, or recorder, or first to recorder and then to camera), please follow the link to my YouTube video in the comment below (or search YouTube for \"Microphones compared: Sennheiser MKE 600, Bronstein BRN-900, BRN-400, Sony PCM M10, Nikon D7000\". Please note that the source sound level in that test was intentionally turned down and the mics or camera placed 10 feet away from the source to compare how they record relatively quiet sounds. The setup of this test required to increase gain on the recorder, which increased the noise levels, but the noise is still acceptable for Sony and Sennheiser. There are many shotgun microphones to choose from. After testing just a few of them, I noticed that their perfomance varied greately on D7000. I got Sennheiser after testing 3 other shotgun mics that produced low sound levels, and one mic in the review was too noisy.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Until the Next Upgrade", "Author": "Dominique", "ReviewID": "R2V7919PYJHFK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a while, and it was the natural upgrade to my baby dslr - the nikon d60.

Forman \"Food Writer\"", "ReviewID": "R15RPXZLD0CSWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About a year ago I decided to upgrade my DSLR from a very serviceable D3000 (which is now being used by my daughter) and I had a few criteria I was looking at. It had to be a Nikon as I already had a couple of lenses, I wanted a large, bright viewfinder, I wanted a focus motor in the camera and I wanted good low-light capabilities as well as easier access to full manual control. My plan was to pick up a D90 body after the D5200 was introduced and the price went down, but that changed after I held a D7000. I was ruined. Watching the prices I realized that the D90 was only a hundred bucks less than the D7000 so it wasn\u2019t worth considering and the then new D7100 didn\u2019t show enough difference to be worth the extra bucks.After close to a year of use, and close to 6,000 photos taken, here are some of my reflections on the camera.The Viewfinder- Bright, large and full of information. I can see what settings I\u2019m changing without taking my eye from the viewfinder.Manual Settings- Very easy to access and once you get used to them, easy to change on the fly.Low Light Capabilities- I normally set it at 160 (reminiscent of Kodak Portra) for normal shooting and have the automatic ISO set at a maximum of 6400 with a minimum shutter of 1/30th. I took a photo of my grandson at ISO 6400 and cropped the image after converting to black and white. Making it full screen on the laptop and zooming in on it to the equivalent of a 16x20. It still looked good with some noise that gave it the look of Tri-X-Pan. Indoor color shots of food (that\u2019s my primary use of the camera, food blogging) at 1600 ISO are magnificent. Over that, you do get some noise.Two card slots- Nice feature. I set it up so I shoot JPEG on one card and RAW on the second.Depth of Field Preview- I missed this feature on cheap cameras.Focus- Many people claim this camera has a \u2018back focus\u2019 issue. I can\u2019t say that I have it on mine; I can\u2019t say that I do. What I can say is that I find it to be the fastest focusing camera I\u2019ve ever had. I also find that it focuses on what I want, most of the time. No camera will ever be 100% accurate.Sharpness- Pictures are sharp and clear. I set the color to vivid for almost everything but portraits where I use some tweaked settings on portrait.Live Screen- Nice, but I like the viewfinder. It doesn\u2019t like to autofocus as well in live mode as the camera uses a different (more archaic) focus system. I haven\u2019t used to video mode as yet, it wasn\u2019t important in buying the camera.Video- This wasn\u2019t important, but I have used it a couple of times and the quality is good. I plan to do some time lapse work at the beach this summer so it will come in handy.By the way, I use prime lenses only. I have a 10.5 fisheye, 35 f1.8, 50 f1.8 and an 85 f3.5 micro. All focus well for me.Overall, I\u2019d recommend this camera to the photographer who wants superb photos and ease of control.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "awsome camera", "Author": "Florencio Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R31BEMG4ZOMWG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "nice camera to add to my collection lots of great functions and takes great pictures with right lenses and fast", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3FX8AVRH3PIEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new camera after 7 years with Nikon D50.

Changed just the body and the lens is the same. I see a considerable difference in picture quality - especially in low light conditions. Looks like D7000 has so much better sensor. The body is bigger and easier to hold (than D60) in my big hands. And one of the main reasons I bought this camera (other than low light performance) is that it has full support for a grip (which makes it perfect for my hands + adds the vertical release button convenience).Other things I like about this camera are more focus points (that made my pictures come out in-focus more often), the dials are great, and the addition (again compared to my previous experience w/ D60) of the control LCD panel on top w/ the current settings is great. I think the U1 & U2 user settings will come in handy once I learn how to use the camere better.

It was such a fantastic deal that I had to take the plunge. For a special at $997 including a 16GB Transcend SDHC class 10 and an Amazon Basic camera backpack... it was just too good a deal to pass-on.I've been using it for about a month now and can report that it is an excellant DSLR. I can even use all my old AI Nikkor lens (only in manual mode since they are all manual lenses) but now I have 28mm, 50mm, 105mm, 43-86mm, 80-200mm, 200mm and a few more.With the VR and Autofocus on the 18-105mm zoom, doubt if I will be using the old lenses. But the 50mm is a F1.4 lens..... for non-flash pictures.I've been using my Canon EOS Rebel DSLR for about 5 years and the lens gave out (internal ribbon cable in the lens failed) so I've been itching to replace it. Almost bought a Canon 60D last year but I hesitated, which was good because I ended up with usually a more expensive Nikon D7000 as compared to normally ~ $200 cheaper Canon.I've setup the D7000 with a 32 GB SD card in slot 1 and a 16GB SD card in slot 2 and setup the camera to take NEF(RAW) into Slot 1 and JPEG Fine in Slot 2 simultaneouly. This is great way to take a picture since if you just want to send or move pictures around, the JPEG is lot smaller file and don't need any processing since all the processing is already done when you take the picture in the camera. For the NEF (Raw) files, they are just very big data file that must be processed in your computer. (The Nikon software included includes the conversion software for NEF (Raw) into JPEG or other formats. The NEF (Raw) allows you to maximize your manipulation of the picture itself in photoshop and other image processing software.So straying away from Nikon and coming back to the fold.....just feels better using a Nikon body. Even though it is a DSLR, compared to my old SLR's, just feels like old times.Just a quick initial commentsBut one scary note: when the package arrived it was left at the front door without signature....was suppose to require a signature and when I opened the box it was loose in the amazon box with no air in the air filled packing bags. Must have punctured during transit. So the Nikon box was just loose in the box. So far no damage to the camera. Although on the third day, when I turned on the camera----nothing.

I've still got much to learn about some of the controls and functions, but that is a good thing as the camera packs many features for those who want to delve into full manual control as I do. The HD movies are also of very high quality. The battery lasts as well too. I put in a 128gig card and have been shooting in raw format exclusively.

I mostly wanted the higher ISO capabilities of the D7000. I also like the fact that it has a magnesium body and is weather sealed. For a comparison between the D7000 and the D90 go to Snapsort's website or DPReview. These cameras have been out of stock for months, and Amazon was the only place I could find one at the time of purchase. I added an aftermarket vertical grip since the Nikon version retails for a laughable $295. I have had two of the grips not work well that I am pretty sure were both manufactured by Meike/Neewer. I bought what was advertised as a Phottix, but received a generic one that has the IR remote and the \"ergonomic\" grip. It works fine and the dials work the same as the camera, so you might look out for one of those. Suppodely Phottix or a Bower are made fairly well, too.

The buffer is actually very poor if you need to take fast action shots, say an aircraft moving at 400mph! The D300 or the D300S will smoke this camera on the continuous shooting side even without the extra battery grip! Nikon made a great camera but forgot to include sufficient buffer in it and because of this I stopped using it and went back using my D300S when I need the extra reach that the DX sensor gives! For landscape or general photography  it doesn't matter but for fast action sports or action oriented events this is NOT the camera to have! Do not believe Nikon's hype about about 100 frames at 6fps!!! Heck not even my D3S will do that it will only take 51 frames at 9fps,(set at L & Fine jpg) before the buffer fills up, despite  using SanDisk Extreme Pro, which is about as fast as one can get at 90MB/s.

Ballard", "ReviewID": "RX365IQC0KH1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this product just over a year now.. And it has been a challenge to own this unit... When it works correctly, it is great, but I have been very challenged with it.. Here is the deal, and I think NIKON is the bigger problem than the camera, but that is hard to explain.. I have had a lot of problems with Nikon in recent years, most of them with their customer service and repair, which in my opinion is just the worst of any company I have done business with, except H&R; BLOCK.. They really are a horrible company... Stay away from them and their products...As for the D7000, I bought it because my D40 died on me in Utah while I was in Canyonlands doing a photo vacation with a photo buddy.. And, note, he uses Canon and never complains!!! While on the shoot, the shutter release died.. I called NIKON, they said send it back, so in a campground, I wrote a letter explaining the issue, took the camera and the letter to the UPS office in MOAB, and mailed the dead camera back to Nikon.. I finished the photo trip without a camera.. My buddy suggested I might need a more professional camera since I was using the D40 a lot.. Might have worn the D40 out.! While on the trip, I met another photographer who does great work and uses the D7000. You can see her work on the web by searching for Faund Images. Super work!... Back home I ordered the D7000 in October of 2011, I think it was. I was actually gettting the camera to learn how to use it before I left on my trip to Europe in October of 2012. The camera arrived, I did some test shots, and discovered the sensor was really dirty.. Really bad.. I called Amazon and reported it.. They would be happy to exchange it for a new one, but they did not have a new one. I could get my money back, but that would be a big problem because I had also ordered two lens, power grip, filters, extra battery, a flash, etc.. The camera was only a part of the whole order.. Returning it for money was not  a good choice.. I called NIKON and explained. A new camera had been delivered dirty.. They said they would check it out if I paid to have it returned, etc.. Could be a month or more to get the camera to them, cleaned and returned.. Not a fast service type thing, plus I had to pay for everything.. So, having the Copper Hill cleaning kit, I cleaned the sensor myself.. Turned out good. And things went well until I was back out west in Colorado doing fall color photos in Sept of 2012. The camera started burning out images. Not often, but two or three times per day, the camera would just decide to make a 1/125 second exposure into a 1/15 second exposure, etc... Burned the images out.. Then, later it stopped doing this on a regular basis.. I would liked to have sent it in for repair, as it was still under warranty at that time, but I was leaving for Europe in October. There would not be enough time to ship the camera to Nikon, get it repaired, because they are very slow, which I know from experience, then be able to take it to Europe with me, which was one of the bigger reasons for buying it and the 18-200 lens. .... It went to Europe with me. I arrived there on Oct 23. The camera worked until the morning of Nov 1. I took some early morning photos, then at 10 AM, just as I was taking a few photos of the tour bus, the camera started the image sensor issue again, and worse.. It did several things that were strange, and in the end it started leaving scan lines on all the images.. That was the end of the photos taking for this camera on this trip.. I still had 17 days of travel left and no camera to take photos with.. This camera was useless. There is another part of this story that I will share soon... I got home from my Europe trip on Nov 18. I mailed the camera to Nikon on November 23... I sent sample photos to show them how the camera had been acting in September in Colorado, and again on Nov 1. Their reply was a letter that stated these issues were caused by water damage. There had been no water or rain on it during the Sept time frame, but on the October 31, while on tour in Rome, it did rain on us.. It rained on us a lot.. I had a rain coat on, and I had a waterproof bag which I used to cover the camera.. I thought I had done a good job of keeping it dry. The people around me were using point and shoot cameras, Big Canon cameras, and even Ipads, to take photos.. None of these ever reported any problems from the rain or the moisture in the air, etc.. And, the advertisements suggests that the D7000 is weather resistant!!!!! Go fugure! What does that mean!!! After several calls and exchanges between Nikon and me, I got the camera back. They would not cover it under warranty, even though the issues started in Sept, long before the one year warranty ended in late October. I agree to pay for the repairs myself as I needed to get the camera back. As it turns out, I had insured all the camera gear before leaving on my trip. I called my insurance people and explained.. Turns out, my insurance would cover my end of the deal, assuming it was water damage.. While I was writing this, the insurance office called to say my money was in the mail.. The camera was mailed to Nikon on November 23, 2012.. I finally got it got it back on January 21, 2013.. The cost to mail it was 17.60, the repair charges were 542.68. There was an unexplained 108.54 discount, there was 18.34 in taxes. The final charge to me was 452.48.. This all adds up to 470.08 dollars to me.. The insurance company is mailing a check to me for this amount.. I got lucky on this part.. Good thing I took out the insurance before going on the trip.... I hope you will consider all this before buying NIKON products... When things work, they are great, when things go bad, you are in for a long hard trip... Think about it.. I am sort of stuck with them because once you start with a company and their equipment, it is hard to get away from them without losing a lot of money, etc....... I have some Canon cameras and have never had issues with them like this.. When I did have a small issue, they covered it fast and they sent letters of apology for me experiencing this issue!!!!!!!!! No apology, ever, from Nikon, plus they are slow and rude, etc... At this rate, I have to wonder how long they can stay in business. There  is one other thing to mention about this camera, the buttons and external controls cannot be locked, and are easy to change without you knowing it.. Several times I thought I was shooting in Normal-basic, etc, only to find that I was shooting in RAW, etc.. All the buttons and controls are unprotected. I have learned to not trust anything on this camera.. I have to check it constantly to make sure settings have not been changed, just by bumping into the controls etc.. Everything should be protected against changes unless you want them changed... Something else that is a problem, is that unlike earlier Nikons where the power grip had both batteries in it, and none in the camera, now, there is one in the camera and one in the grip. What a pain... I am constantly having to take the power grip off to get to the battery in the camera to recharge it... In previous models, the grip could stay on the camera all the time, but not with this thing... So, keep that in mind... I have no idea what these people were thinking when they did this... It sure makes it more difficult to use....  I think I have covered most of the material I have to offer at this time.. I will update if something new crops up, but having this camera is like having a problem child or a lemon car, you just cannot relax and use it. There is always the worry of what is going to go wrong next...", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon D7000", "Author": "G.

I dropped off my D40 and 35mm 1.8 for cleaning/small repair and was told I'd be sans camera for 3 weeks.  So, I said \"screw it\" and bought this camera and the 50mm 1.8 as a kit.  At first, much like a new pair of shoes, I was disappointed.  But once I broke in the soles, so to speak, I forgot how much I had paid and started to really enjoy this device.  I've since taken over 5,000 photos with it on my recent travels.  If you are debating between this and a D700, get both, as this is far better as a walking-around camera and the DX lenses are cheaper.  Or, if you want to save come coin, get the perfectly good D3100.  But neither will be as much fun as this puppy.  Nice weight without being too heavy, deep grip, quick autofocus and intelligent auto mode, and great performance at high iso.  I even use live view as my dog gets scared when I disappear behind the viewfinder.  Even video isn't bad, though an external mic is required.

This is a SERIOUS camera. The two SD Card slits is awesome on the DX line. I've rented all the most expensive cameras and for all around everyday shooting whether portrait, landscape, seascape, or shooting the northern lights under very dark conditions, the ISO higher settings have little to no noise and it comes with a very thick and in depth guide to get you use to the advanced features fast. Be prepared to buy a weatherproof color coded shortcut guide or use the cameras built in feature to create your own customized menu with just the settings you need to change the most because its menu is huge.

If so, next question.Do you want a DSLR with a large selection of very good lenses?  If so, it's either Nikon or Canon.  Leica's another category.  Next question.Can you take excellent photos with either Nikon or Canon?  Yes.  Next question.Are you currently invested in a selection of DSLR lenses, either Nikon or Canon?  If so, stick with that brand.  Next question.Do you need one or more specific features that only one brand has?  Hard to believe, but, if so, buy that brand.  Next question.So, how do you choose your camera?  Don't limit yourself to reading about the cameras you're considering.  Try them, or at least go to a camera store and play with them.  Touch and feel are big factors.  Really!  My personal experience is that I went to a camera store to buy a Canon T4i.  I decided on it, because it's less expensive, easier to use, and has a highly-reviewed LCD screen (i.e., I read about features that appeal to me).  Before I bought the Canon, I held it, looked through the viewfinder, pressed the buttons, and turned the dials.  Before I bought it, merely out of curiosity, I did the same with the Nikon D7000.  Bang.  I bought the Nikon.  The touch and feel varied drastically, for my taste.  Most importantly, the Nikon viewfinder is head and shoulders more usable and comfortable, and that's what I'm always looking through.  Also important, the buttons and dials work and feel better.  And, by comparison, the Canon does feel flimsy.I haven't used my Nikon much yet.  Also, since I'm a novice, you may question the value of my opinion.  However, here's my experience with my Nikon.  It is larger and heavier, but not so much larger and heavier that the difference is a problem.  My Nikon feels study, and it's buttons and dials feel sturdy.  When I take a shot, the internals sound solid, with no shake.  It's an intangible that's difficult to explain, but is best described by two experts you can find on the internet.  One expert is Lori Grunin on CNET's website, where the Nikon D7000 is reviewed.  Her amorphous enthusiasm at first appears overly subjective, but turns out to be exactly true for me too.  The other expert is Ken Rockwell, who has his own website.  Everything he says resonates with me, and perhaps will resonate with you too.  For anything less serious than a full-frame professional camera costing much more money, the Nikon D7000 is his clear choice.  Why, again it's difficult to explain, except to say -- Try it, you'll like it.One more thing -- about lenses.  They are a personal choice.  One of the lenses I bought is the Nikkor AF-S 50mm f/1.4G.  It is a full-frame lens.  The 50mm focal length is affected because the camera is a DX body (not full-frame).  However, the lens works perfectly with the camera body.  And the lens is excellent.  I took a shot of a sculpture in an outdoor sculpture garden, and the photo has the look and feel of art.  I took many shots of my grandchildren (using continuous shooting mode), and I can't fail to get a good shot, even indoors without a flash.  If you buy this camera body, I strongly recommend you consider buying this lens.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "worked fine", "Author": "Dili", "ReviewID": "R9MDXO179DPI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a very good buy for me.

It seems that the issue is caused by excessive amounts of lubricant, applied to some of the shutter assembly parts. This may lead to clearly visible spots due to droplets of this lubricant on the sensor. The bad thing that it seems that even after sensor cleaning many users experience this issue again, so it seems the only option here is to replace the camera or send it to the Nikon but ensure they will actually address the issue through replacing of the corresponding parts or re-applying correct amount of lubricant to it (instead of standard sensor cleaning).

Also comes with a few effect like the miniature, fish-eye, etc.What I would like to have/change:- A better frame rate for the price. Shoots at 6fps at the moment.- A better, bigger buffer size for shooting RAW and JPG at Large size. Shoots up to 10 RAW images before buffer is full.- A couple of more customizable (Fn) buttons, although this might be too much to ask for.- A few more manual mode options' usability during Live View.- A better user's manual.Some might complain the AF is slower than the pro-level 51 Point AF system developed by Nikon, but the speed also depends, I think, on the lens in use.I have bought only FX lenses so far, since they are reverse compatible with DX bodies. So I can use the same lenses, if I switch over to FX in the future. I'd recommend a 50mm or 35mm prime for amazing sharp low-light, low noise images.The Nikon D7000 can shoot the amazing Full HD videos to top it all off, I wish it did 60fps or more too.Overall image qaulity: Very goodBuild and Handling: Very goodValue for money: ExcellentFeatures: ExcellentLow light images: Very Good up to ISO 1200.Dynamic Range: Amazing at ISO 100.Having a great set of machinery will not necessarily produce world class photos, if as a photographer you don't take the time and pains for a good composition, and again while to edit the RAW images.

My one gripe relates to the \"Auto ISO\" function when used in conjunction with flash. The camera will generally jump up to your highest selected ISO when flash is engaged. I understand that in previous cameras such as the D90, the ISO would not exceed 400 if flash was engaged, even if the max ISO selected was in fact higher. This sounds like a better arrangment to me. The obvious work-around is to go in and lower the max ISO on your Auto ISO setting when using flash, which is difficult, just a matter of remembering to do this. Seems like something that could be corrrected with a software update, though. An extremely versatile camera. Highly recommended.Update:This camera has a setting under the Auto ISO function where you can set the minimum shutter speed that the camera will use, which is handy. However, some of the newer Nikons have the ability to automatically change this minimum based on the focal length of the lens at the moment. For instance, using a long lens you would likely need a faster minimum shutter speed than with a wide angle lens. The new cameras can automatically adjust the minimum to a higher value when they detect the longer focal length. The D7000 can't do that, which is not a deal breaker for me but would be nice feature to have.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrific DSLR", "Author": "C.

Bad part - if you get used to holding D200 or similar body (D300) then D7000 would feel not so comfy (big) in your hands. Plus, if you have big hands (long fingers) it might not be a very comfortable. But it is something that you can get used to with time.Another, thing that would require getting used to is controls, focusing - D7000 has more focusing points but also it has a bit different setting than D200. If set it up as you like it at first then it should not be an issue, but if you would rely on basic auto focusing (default all 39 points) it might be frustrating because it might focus on something that you do not expect.Well, again - just matter of time to get know this camera and set it up for your self.In regards of quality / sharpness of the image - I got scattered result due to condition of shooting - I was in flying plane with some little turbulence. But when I was standing on air field most of my images were sharp. Just a side note - I shoot RAW (NEF) which would require post editing, including some sharpening.In addition to this part - it all depend on what glass you are using. This factor would contribute to sharpness and brightness of the images - greatly. And you have to remember that each lens has it own \"sweet spot\" - aperture that would produce sharp images - it is not always F16 or F22.Along with purchasing this camera I purchased 2 32Gb SD class 10 card (Transcend). Unfortunately for me - one card in Slot #1 failed when I was in the air. I tried to resurrect it but ended up removing it and moving card in slot # 2 into #1 slot. But it is not cameras fault. After this everything worked well.Another point that you would need to get used to is buffer size of this camera, especially if you are shooting RAW and with continuous shooting. As to my test in High Speed Continuous shooting camera can  store up to 10 RAW images and then it shuts off to unload buffer which takes about 9-10 seconds and this is with class 10 cards.As oppose to D200 which can handle 21 sequential RAW images it might look not enough. But - it is for you to decide if you can live with such buffer.Menus - are similar to D200, so if you a proud owner of this camera then it should not be a problem for you to work with menus.I'm sure there are many other little things that can be found (good and bad) - but it would be just a matter of your own taste.Wish you good luck and have fun with this camera if you are buying it.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lives up to, and exceeds, the hype!", "Author": "Jenny Bauman", "ReviewID": "R2PTWJGZA4LX2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only been experimenting with this body-only a short time, but I'm already blown away.

I've seen a lot of people complaining from a variety of manufacturing defects in this camera, ranging from hot pixels to a softness due to focus issues.I went to a store and I tried a display model of the camera. I was impressed about the quality of pictures taken at ISO 4000! I was speechless seeing very sharp and vivid pictures produced at that high ISO which is like a day and night compared to my aging D80. I was sold and asked the sales man to bring me a body only. I assumed that the new camera he was selling me will function the same, I was wrong!After getting home, I started taking pictures with my new D7000, then this feeling of dissatisfaction and unhappiness started to develop inside me. A closer examine of the pictures showed a halo around dark objects and softness in the picture and most of the time, the camera was unable to even focus on the target and it was still taking pictures. I tried everything possible with this camera, I tried fine tuning the lens with no use, I updated the firmware to the latest but without any improvements. Last nail in the coffin was to directly compare this camera ISO performance and sharpness against my D80!!the rules were like this:Nikkor 50mm 1.8DManual shooting was selected, ISO 2000 and 1.8 was the lens openness.1- D80 in those conditions was able to take optimum image at lens speed of 1/30 of a sec. which is fare compared to the camera old model and conditions of light. Noise was acceptable and color reproduction was terrible. Which is really the limitation of the D80.2- D7000 in the same conditions was only able to take the picture at a lens speed of 1/20 of a sec!!!! which is even slower than my aging D80. Noise levels were as high as of my D80 and Sharpness was lacking. The image was soft and even my D80 was able to take sharper images at lower resolution.I took the camera back to store and after they tested it for few seconds, they were agreeing with me that the camera I bought was defected. I was refunded with store credits and i'm saving them for the D800.The D7000 is very good camera when it's not defected. The Images taken were really really sharp at even ISO 4000. I liked that and I liked the vivid pictures that this camera is able to take at  high ISO. Also I liked the out of focus background taken buy this camera, it's not going to give you the same bokeh you get from a full frame sensor but still that out of focus background was much better than what my D80 can do.I don't recommend buying this product online.

In low light it focused very quickly and I was very happy with everything except especially the improved flash metering (metering in general actually, you often have to baby sit the d700 meter in tricky light if you use it).  Unfortunately when I looked at the images on my computer it seemed like most of them were WAY too soft for a fast prime.  I calibrated all of my lenses on it and tried my damnest to fix the issue and upgraded to the most recent issue but it still SEVERELY backfocused in about every third shot or so, just enough to keep the subject from being sharp enough.  I noticed it was worse with my G series pro lenses, my old 85 1.4d seemed to nail every time though.I could have sent it into get fixed but my biggest problem with the camera was the flexability of the raw files and dynamic range at high iso's.  At 3200 if it didn't nail the exposure the photo was \"difficult\" to save and the resulting image would always lose way too much detail and smooth tonal gradation.  I already knew i was spoiled by the d700 but the specs said it should have been better than it was.It is a very good camera, but I agree that the focusing issues with this camera and the i guess, \"quality of the noise pattern in the raw files at high isos\" prevent it from being an acceptable backup to my D700, the D300 is still just more convenient and excellent at low iso.Things I liked:-Handling-Metering-weight and size-felt very well built-video was cool but still not good enough-dual card slots  THANK YOU NIKON.Things I didn't like:-no af-on button (which sort of drives me nuts due to personal habits)-Focusing-The noise pattern at high iso (1600-3200+ w/ no NR)resembles a pointilism impressionist painting instead of the more natural film grain look from the x100 and D700  I pretty much only shoot my x100 at between 2200 and 3200 without ever having a quality issue.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pro quality camera for less", "Author": "L.

Larger number of pixels has enhanced the image quality significantly.In my experience apart from the other features like larger ISO range, higher frames per second capturing the one I discussed above helped me lot while shooting. Only point I am trying to figure out in D7000 and that I loved in D90 was single point focussing. While focussing at places where you need sharp focus at a point, D7000 has a limitation of not being able to focus at a single point. However I would like to add that maybe its my mistake that I was not able to figure out a way for single point focussing and I am still working on it.

Biggs", "ReviewID": "R1GIXNXMJ2N0CB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been old-school for all of my years of photography.  I have probably over 1,000 if not 2,000 film photos (I would have to go back and manually count becuse I have lost some over the years and various people have gone through, moved, taken, etc... them).  My wife bought a hybrid Canon S3 is camera about 7 years ago.  It is a pretty nifty little camera.  It takes long exposures and has various shooting modes, but has a fixed (zoom) lens and only a few bells and whistles.  I was hoping that we would get to go for another trip to Peru for my birthday, but, alas, finances...  For my consolation prize, I finally upgraded to a true dSLR- the Nikon D7000 DSLR to go with my lenses (mainly Nikkor).  I received it about 9 days ago.  I started reading the manual, but at 300+ pages, finally decided to dive in.  I read how to set-up the camera and went for it.  Over the years, I have pretty much decided that I like aperature-preferred shooting except for shooting B&W; infrared.  I used a hand-held light meter and had to set the shutter speed manually for that.  Anyway, back to the D7000. It has an shutter speed from 1/8,000th (!!!) of a second all the way to the equivalent to cable release.  You do need a remote to take full advantage of this.  Holding the shutter button down manually or even just pressing twice can cause all kinds of havoc on long exposures.  The \"bulb\" setting allows you to totally override the shutter speed regardless of lighting conditions.  This camera will do pretty much anything an old-school film SLR can do.  It has about every bell and whistle you can imagine or want.  So far I have been happy with the results and the images are clear and sharp.  I have yet to take full advantage of everything.  In the half-week I have been playing with it, I have shot in aperature-priority mode for pretty much all of my shots.  I have played with the D-lighting, ev values, and a couple of other features.  I am really excited about trying out the continuous high-speed mode (up to 100 photos by holding down the shutter- you won't have to worry about camera shake at 1/8,000th of a second!  lol) and the strobe-effect flash.  I might try to see if the two options can be done at high shutter speeds.  The only downsides that I have found so far are that it is DX-format (not really its fault, it is what it is); light output of flash is lame; even at the high D-light setting; there is really not much of an increase in contrasting detail (will have to experiment more); some of the commands are not intuitive (with as many options as it has, not too surprising); and a really weird thing happened while I was photographing the moon, Venus, and Jupiter conjuction.  When I gave the ev value a positive response (even at 0.3!), the moon ghosted on another part of the frame.(?!?)  I will have to do some research to see whether it is the camera, the lens, or maybe even just the angle of the shot.  These issues are the only reasons that I did not give this 5 stars are because of the flash and the mysterious ghosting in that one series of shots.  In conclusion, with the shots I have tried (and I have played with more settings than some people ever will), this appears to be a VERY solid dSLR.  This is a great dSLR and the flash is the main limiting factor for this level of camera.  This can be remedied by using an SB-700 or other flash, but having to shell out more money kind of sucks.  I have absolutely no regrets with this purchase.  The packaging was great and Amazon shipped it out quickly.  It comes with nice accessories such as an eyepiece cover (useful for those long exposures).  With things like exposure lock, focus lock, white balance, being able to do post-editing within the camera (better than using outside software), and quite a few other features, this camera will keep even the most serious amatuer happy.  You might consider going for the FX version at another $1K, but that is the cost of a good Nikkor lens, for not THAT much of an upgrade.  At that point, you might as well go for the D800E.  Unless you are a professional photographer, you would buy a Nikon D4, this camera is a GREAT value for its price.  Enjoy and fill up that 32 gig memory card of which you can have TWO at once!!!

My experience was that the lenses fit the camera fine with the adapter but the picture quality left a lot to be desired.  I could not use the old lenses.The D7000 is a fine camera and I found that although I had never used a Nikon or a DSLR before, I felt very comfortable with the camera and the controls after a relatively short period of time.  To me, this camera is a masterpiece of photographic engineering.The kit lens, on the other hand falls way short of the camera.  To put this lens on this camera is like putting some old bias ply tires on a Ferrari.  You could still drive the Ferrari but you would not come close to getting out of the car what the manufacturer put into it.

I was not really in photography when I purchased it. The first time I've ever seen a \"complete\" selections of cameras was at the bx store. They were Minoltas, Olympus, Nikkormats, Canons, Kodaks and Nikons. It was so intoxicating because I love prescisions in things especially wrist watches. Now, cameras? They were about half the price when I was overseas, how can I go wrong? The only name I was familiar with were Minolta and Kodak. I chosed the Minolta SRT 101 to buy, after saving a few bucks, over the others and it was a little cheaper than the others. After I got the camera I bought a small book by Kodak titled: Introduction to Photography. It covered apertures, shutter speeds, developing negatives and enlargements plus other stuffs that I skipped at first. At the base we had a photography hobby shop. I sort of checked it out and got started in developing black and white negatives and prints. The \"GIs\" that were with me doing thesame things were using more Nikkormats, Nikon Fs, Canons and Olympus' and very few had Minoltas. It made me wonder if I made the wrong choice. That's when I learned that Nikon F is the best one to have and  professionals use mostly Nikons. Nikons have the best metering system and lenses. Nikon invented and developed most of the metering innovations, so they said. They were always sold out and in short supply. I wanted to buy one and have saved the money for it. Seemed like everyone that wanted to buy one were \"camping out\" the store parking lot ala BestBuys on black fridays. I didn't get a chance to get one during the rest of my stay. The name Nikon got stucked in my mind ever since until I got out of the air force in 1968. Those guys (GIs) were correct in their praise of Nikon. I was collecting photography magazines almost each time I go to magazine stands and at the super market magazine sections. I learned more about cameras from magazine reviews and users'reviews and advertisements. Going back to my first SLR camera,I never was really happy with my Minolta ever since I got it. It overexposes most of the times. I wanted to try a Nikon, I know it is a much better camera. I could hardly afford one then because I just gotten married and my wife was expecting too. I bought a Canon slr instead. To make the story short, When I began to earn more money, after a 2-3 years, was when I decided to by a Nikon (F3). I kept it for more than ten years and didn't even dream of replacing it. As a matter of fact, I have invested on several lenses for it. When the digital age came about was when I kept abreast on photography again. I decided to go digital slr just 2 or three years ago. I chosed the Canon Rebel because it was so popular and out selling Nikon. Boy, was I impressed. Nomore negatives, etc. Instant previews, pictures, nomore going to photolabs and having to wait for things. I kept the Canon for a year and a half. In fact I even purchased a Canon G7 a few months after the Rebel. I have several cons on Canon. My Rebel's metering system sucks when on automatic modes and flash shooting. In manual mode it is excellent because I am in control, if I take my time. The Rebel, if I can recall, only has 8 megapixels. When megapixels (all manufacturers) went much higher and have reached 12s and 16's was when I decided to upgrade. I chosed the Nikon D7000 over its competetitors and I love it like I loved my F3. It remined me of my F3's performance so much and of course the D7000 is alot smarter camera. It has the lowest noise even at the highest ISO setting. Of course the resolution is great because of its high megapixels. I really have nothing negative to say about this camera except for the video mode (I only gave it a try just a few times) and its weight. It seems to get heavier the longer I carry it on my shoulder. It is a few ounces heavier than the Canon because it is mostly made up of magnesium. It is a minor price to pay, though, for a topnotch camera and there are other cameras that are even heavier. Full frames? I just thought I'd mention this very minor issue that most users could live with it for lack of any major thing to complain about.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Our first DSLR - a great camera", "Author": "Jeff Edmonston \"-= be cool, but care =-\"", "ReviewID": "R39ZX8FUEDLF0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had the camera six months now.

And please, since this is just my personal opinion that I just want to share with others, those who already own D7000 shouldn't feel offended by my review because this is just my personal experience I had with D7000.I first bought D90 but soon switched to d7000 because I only hear good things about it..  Like many of you, I spent days after days searching for just a right camera which can take my photography skill to the next level.Anyway, to make the long story short at first I liked the camera because it takes sharp photos with nice color rendering.  I was using nikkor 35mm f 1: 1.8G lens and although it's not the best lens out there it handled the low light condition pretty well.  Most of the shots I took came out pretty sharp and bright with almost no noise even at 3200 ISO.  However, the more I take the photos I soon began to notice there's something lacking in the pictures.  They're well focused, bright, clean and vivid so what's the problem here?  The problem is that my photos do not look `natural'.  It almost feel as if I am looking at, sort of like photo realistic, well drawn painting or perhaps I should say, `computer animation graphic like you see in Pixar movies. (ex. Toy Story)  Of course, with Photoshop tweak that problem becomes even more apparent.  If you're not sure what I mean, please go to flickr.com and type D7000 and see if you can tell the difference.But D90, on the other hand, although it wasn't as 'perfect' as I thought(good though, just not perfect) at least it gaves me realistic looking photos.  I saw many review clips on Youtube that compare D7000 to D300s and explain the reasons why they think D7000 is a better choice over D300s.  Well, I am begining to question if those people at youtube are truthfully being objective in sharing their honest opinion, or if they were smply hired by Nikon to promote and boost sales of new D7000.  From looking at the sample photos from different sites it really wasn't hard to tell D7000 and D300s are not in the same level as far as the picture quality goes.  Even with heavy photoshop tweaks I still think those photos from D300s still do look like \"photos\".:Of course, the quality of lens has A LOT to do with it too.  I just wish there's more acutal photo comparsion done with same lens with different bodies, or vise vesa and let the viewers come to better understanding with image quality generated by each camera/lens.  Some people like vivid colors, some don't--It's very subjective matter.  Just comparing the spec between cameras don't really mean much to me, as quality of photo is more important than anything else.  For others, other functions like capability of full HD, High ISO, and etc are just as important as image quality.  I know some guys in Youtube said image quality of D7000, when comapred to that of D300, looked \"at least\" the same or in some cases, better.  In my honest opnion,  that is not true. D300s is better when it comes to image quality.  When I look at the details from D7000 and D300s, it's sharpness is kind of like comparing it to  \"Pencil vs. 0.3 mechanical pencil.Don't get me wrong, Nikon D7000 in my opinion, is a good camera.  Many people also choose D7000 because of full HD capability.  I was certainly one of them.  But after all, I am buying a camera, not a camcorder.  I mean, taking a great looking shots certainly weighs more than multi-function camera.  Again, D7000 is a good camera.  D90 is good too consider it's value.  But I don't think it is equivalent with D300s as some claim.

I have had a D40 x for a long while and have been happily add lenses to my arsenal for the last few years.  I worked with physical film photography in high school and college so my eventual transition into dSLR was a little easier than those coming from say a Polaroid experience.  But I don't intend nor am I a professional.  That being said, I can see how this camera cow,d easily be marketed to one.  There are a million buttons and menus and dials and knobs that are quite intimidating.  So I am writing to say, this camera can be used by a pro but offers excellent options for someone who will leave it on Auto Mode for the majority if the time.Highlights I have learned about since I got mine yesterday.-Bracketing.  This feature let's you take a series of 2 to 3 shots quickly while the computer resets your lighting settings to be slightly more exposed and slightly less composed that what it thinks is perfect.  Nice!-There is a physical knob that can be adjusted to set the camera for single, continuous shooting, remote or timer shooting.  I hated going into the menu to do this.-Scene modes are now In a menu rather than on the dial.  I'm okay with this.  They added many many more scene settings so moving it \"Indoors\" seems logical.-while a little bigger, the camera does seem much heavier than my D40.-white balance is offering better descriptions of variations offered (vice the + or - numbers previously used) if not flat out more options there-very easy method, via a small button, to watch not through the viewfinder but on the back screen.-video was astoundingly good... was very sorry my first video was of my office chair... totally not postable.  There is a mic and it looks like there is an input for an external mic.  HDMI Jack outlet too on the body.I'm sure there are a million more things to talk about.  Ultimately, my point is that the many new buttons and such seem very logical and impressive.  For the average family photographer, they offer great features.  Considering that my spouse paid about this much for my d40x back in the day (+-200$ I suspect) this camera is absolutely worth the pennies.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Kenny", "ReviewID": "RJ0T3KQDD5Q67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D7000, was brand new in the box as quoted in the advertisement.I was very well, pleased with the package..", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "What a Camera!", "Author": "C", "ReviewID": "R1TGDC0I16CJPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just like Ken Rockwell I started my camera use with the same Minolta Srt 35mm camera.

I also have someone in the family that is well known pro photographer, so I have had lots of opportunities to see and play some with the latest greatest full frame gear available.When I went fully digital around 2002 I sold off my Nikon 35mm gear and had various point and shoots. DSLR fever struck me again when I bought a Sony A330. I still like it, but I have totally outgrown the menu based controls, but I don't shoot enough to justify the latest greatest in gear.So when I recently found an exceptional price on a Nikon refurbished D7000, I took the plunge.It is an astounding camera, for anyone that wants to shoot M A  or S modes.(If you mainly shoot auto mode, save some money and get a 31/200. The pictures will be the same and you can control most of the settings in the menus and it doesn't make you a lesser person. Just someone with more money to spend on something else.)However if you want manual control,  D7000 lets you change your settings at a button, in many ways like some of the pro gear I had a chance to play with.The features leave very little to be desired.  This is considered a semi pro camera and that is exactly what it is. Unless you are pro, you will not need anything else.In conclusionPros: too many to mention. battery life is great too. However I like having two batteries,  and found a good 3rd party battery for $13Cons: small buffer if you shoot very fast raw.

The camera in awesome. The more I work with it the more I love it. But there are 2 flaws :1. LCD quality is low. You can not determine weather the shot was good enough or not. More often you think a shot was not good, blurry, noisy, whatever and in computer you find out that it was the best shot. The quality of the LCD screen should be improved.2. In scenes mode which can save you so much trouble in some situations, you have limited control over the Flash. For example you want to take a self portrait with sunset in the background. The easiest way is to set the camera on Sunset mode and force-turn on the flash to lit the face. That's not going to happen, you can not turn on the flash and that's a big big issue. because then you have to go over the manual mode and adjust everything, iso, WB, A, S, flash and... most of the time it not possible to do the job right specially with the low LCD quality.Otherwise, owesome camera, seriously liked it", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "D-7000", "Author": "Andrew R.

Well, the specs are amazing.

Before the D7000 i had a nikon D40. I suggest you starting at a lower grade camera before buying this one if you are a amature. When i opend the box i instantly knew this is the camera i always dreamed for. If you are a amature go for the D90 or D40. The D7000 is to much for an amature to handle personaly. As a phtographer that shoots 100s of pictures a week i was still over welmed with the controls and settings. The 16.2 megapixels gave me a chrisp image when filming and shooting. I dont suggest this to people that are trying to make a movie. More of a short film camera. This camera has great setting but the audi can be hard to get right sometimes.Personally i think this camera wins over the D300s. Thats my opinion. If you love photography and have the money to spend buy this camera! No doubt about it this camera is one of the best (Amature) cameras out there. People call this a amature camera, but this camera has a way higher pottential than that. This camera is the camera you want, trust me its great for sports, portraits, landscapes, etc. i love this camera and im sre you will to.

I took it because I was about to \"wither and die\" while waiting for a successor of the D300. Despite the high praise in the official tests, and some enthusiastic user report here, I do not see it that way. I was surprised to see how much less of a camera it is compared to D300/D700. Furthermore, my exemplar has quality issues, not up to usual Nikon standard, and of course any comments on them earn the \"not helpful\" predicate from the fan gallery. I stand by this summary. My experiences are:a) In P mode with auto-ISO it can happen that the camera ignores the program shift! That violates the very spirit of a manual program shift. User tries to overwrite the setting chosen by the camera, because the 3 contributing factors Shutter-Aperture-ISO provide several degrees of freedom. This is the biggest disappointment here, not Nikon at all. Turn, turn, twist, left, right... nothing happens, motive is gone, goodbye. That is not Nikon!b) The camera does not raise max shutter time for longer lenses in P, as it was traditional with many Nikon bodies. Both F4/F90 were excellent with that, it is such an old technology. Here when I put in the longer 80-200 f/2.8 for example, the shutter time might be often selected way too long, e.g. 1/40, acceptable to shorter lenses only. I would like to see the \"mm/2\" heuristics as a ballpark. Thus for 200mm, 1/100sec or less should be chosen by the camera, for 400mm 1/200sec or less. Of course, program shift should still work!c) Bad card reader slots! Too tight, some cards would not eject! In slot B my Transcend card hangs and I have to use tweezers to pull it out. However, the Sandisk cards operate in slot B, tight, but they move out. Something is not ok about the tolerances. No any other of our numerous SD readers make any problem with the Transcend card, though! Consequently this seems to be a problem with my D7000 card slot only.d) Very slippery grip, nothing like the D300. Some test reports praise it, here is an example from dpreview: \"...'proper' rubber hand grip (as opposed to just rubberized coating) give it a reassuring heft which is closer to the experience of holding and using a camera like the Canon EOS 7D, or Nikon D300S.\", but I do not see it any \"reassuring\" at all.  No compare to the safe soft grip of the D300!e) Inconsistent menu operations. For example, I tried to enter my copyright data. No matter how often I entered them, the copyright setting stayed still on OFF. Finally I have discovered what is the anomaly: One have to move the cursor upward to the \"Done\" field, and than and only than the setting will be preserved! In most other cases \"set and exit\" principle applies: The selected setting stays always active.f) The depth of field button on a wrong place. I kept hitting it over and over again. The infuriating \"click-clack\" \"click-clack\" repeated itself until I discovered than I can place other function on it, thus disable it in end-effect. I put \"display grid,\" which I see anyways. Finally it is quiet!g) The bracketing button is close to the flash pop-up button, and so instead of setting the bracket mode, one can pop the flash inadvertently.h) In a playback mode to my surprise both wheels were... \"dead,\" useless. Only later I have discovered that I can activate them in the menus. I wonder what prompted the decision to make them inactive in playback mode?i) Very slow in mode change. For example, when I press the playback button, sometimes it takes 3-4 sec with \"busy clock\" in the display till finally the image shows. Equally sluggish can be entry to the menus. (This sluggishness seem to hamper the popularity of the smaller Nikon's camera, the P7000 as well. The Canon G12 is so much fast faster.) Nikon should look into these performance issues in their firmware!j) On my camera, the small rubber Power Cord Cover can peel off and hang annoyingly in the air from the hand grip. Very disturbing, not Nikon at all. Probably also a tolerance and quality control problem.k) Strange remote control operation. In order to use the ML-L3 one have to turn the under-wheel on the left to the \"remote\" position, in which case, the main shutter release is... disabled! Why to do such thing? In Canon's one may use the RC-6 without such unduly limitations! Here Nikon should really rethink their ergonomics.One generic observation about bracketing: Why only 3 exposures? In D300 one might make up to 9, it costs nothing, it is about firmware choice only. So why 3 only?But the main problem with the bracketing in all Nikon cameras is more serious and is still prevalent, albeit it was previously widely commented upon in D200,D300,D700: In a Single Shot mode the camera makes only one image, even when the bracketing is selected, and it stays in bracket mode. The bracket indicator is tiny, it is possible to forget that the mode is on! I did so in the past a few times. For hours I shot 0ev, +1ev, +2ev, -1ev -2ev's and so on, and so on. Of course later upon review of the images the \"oh my god, what have I done?\" effect kicks in... We asked Nikon for a \"priority bracket\" setting:  If bracketing, ALWAYS shoot at once the entire series with max. speed.  Never leave camera in bracket mode in the middle of the sequence.To no avail. The same problem can still occur with the D7000!!! I am disappointed with Nikon here.Other than that, the sensor and low noise abilities of the D7000 are a real improvement over the D300/D300s (not the D700 though, but that's expected.) This camera leaves even the EOS-7D in the dust (which we also have.) Considering the long list of negative observations, it is a 'flawed gem' of kinds. Some issues can be improved in firmware, others only through better quality assurance and a better choice of materials.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "focus? a joke.", "Author": "Clare Cassidy", "ReviewID": "R4YANV97EWRP7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Focus is a joke.

My local camera store has asked Nikon now to replace the battery, and at first Nikon denied the request, but then the store showed Nikon that the work order included the battery.  Still, 3 weeks have gone by, and no battery.  I am so (bleep) frustrated with this lack of service from Nikon, I can honestly say I will never buy another Nikon item again.

I would consider myself an enthusiast that in the past few years have stepped up to DSLR's and Micro 4/3 cameras.  I was lucky enough to get my hands on one of these D7000's and use it for an entire weekend a few weeks ago.  My previous camera prior to the D7000 was a Panasonic Lumix GH1.  I loved that camera especially the video capabilities but I sold it in anticipation of the new Panasonic Lumix GH2 being released.  Then Panasonic started to delay the release and I desperately needed a camera so I decided to purchase the Nikon D7000 instead.  I figured if I liked it I would simply keep it and pass on the Panasonic Lumix GH2.So here are my impressions after a full weekend shooting a birthday party and baptism.PROs- Feels great in your hand, atleast for me.  My wife did not care for this beast of a camera.- Low Light Shooting was absolutely incredibly. I noticed this shooting inside a church.  Best ever!- Picture quality was also excellent.  I had many compliments on the photos after the weekend.- Has Autofocus motor for NON AF-S Lenses so if you have old Nikon lenses this is a plus.- 2 SD memory card slots. Kinda cool. Not sure how much I need it but I like the concept if I want to use 1 slot as backup.- Speed of the camera was ridiculously fast when taking pics thru the viewfinder!  Incredible.- You can do a lot of in camera editing of photos which is really neat.- Bracketing feature is cool, especially if you're not a pro like me.All in all from a picture standpoint I don't think I could have been happier.Cons- Autofocus in Video was down right terrible! It's slow and sometimes never resolves and you get stuck with a blurry video.  Nikon needs a lot of work here still.  Plan on using Manual AF. Continuous Autofocus on this is more of marketing thing.- In liveview mode picture taking is impossible.  So SLOW!  Not big of a deal for me but my wife likes the liveview.- No articulating screen. Why not?  All other cameras have an articulating screen, even entry level dslr's now.Summary:If you simply want a top notch camera and don't mind lugging around a decent size DSLR this is a great camera. If you want a nice camera, smaller footprint, but better video capabilities then go with the Panasonic Lumix GH1 or upcoming GH2.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043VE27Y/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnkIf you choose the Panasonic you sacrifice on the low light performance but get superior video results and it's a much smaller camera and lenses.Ultimately I sold my D7000 because I could not get past the poor implementation of Continuous Autofocus for video.  Some will say that is ridiculous but when my main objective of using this is taking pictures of my family which includes 2 little ones I prefer a properly working continuos autofocus feature over manual anyday.  In addition I want 1 device to take my pics and videos and the Panasonic GH2 should fit the bill perfectly if Panasonic could ever start shipping them.  My wife also prefers the size and weight of the Panasonic over the Nikon.

I put about 20K on it during the past year, doing both video and professional photo work with it.The camera is a backup/DX body to my D700, which is far superior.The D7K is a big advancement from other DX bodies in the Nikon line. It is not particularly well suited for professional use, especially weddings, which I attempted.First, the autofocus is worse than the D300's. By worse, I mean it struggles greatly in low light. Not good for a wedding camera. Consistenly, all my shots of processionals with this camera on Continuous focus have been off. Its tracking abilities in low light are very poor.It's also noisy. Way noisier than the D700. Easily 3 stops. Above 400, it gets very noisy, very quickly.The images are also soft. Even at ISO 100, I am getting images that seem soft. Yes, I'm using a tripod and top-notch optics.Nikon's noise processing really takes a toll on sharpness. Their DX cameras have always had this issue, and the D7000 does little to improve upon it.Color is OK. With some work, you can get good skin tones.Exposure is generally good, but the LCD is very misleading. Use the histogram for your exposure decisions. The LCD is way too bright, even when it is dialed back to -3.The video is excellent. I feel the quality, when using great class like Zeiss, is on par with my Panasonic HMC150. Audio is horrible. Forget it. Buy a Zoom H4N for that. You will also need the Zacuto finder accessory if you plan to do video with this. If you don't use something like that, expect unsharp results. The LCD by itself is nearly useless for focusing.The two big minuses for video: the screen does not articulate. What's with this? Even the cheaper models do that, and of course, Canon.The other issue is no 1080 30p or 60p. You can't do slow motion at 24p.This is a stop-gap body for me. I'm waiting for a D700 with video, and then this will go to the auction. In the meantime, accepting its limitations, it can do a decent job on family photos and some landscape stuff.

Stell", "ReviewID": "R20FHXFSD3XQNX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a specific review. I am using a 28-300mm Nikor lens with VRII stabilization. The lens is used in all modes, selected on the lens body. The camera is the D7000. The lens was paired with an expensive hoya ultra-violet filter. The camera was NOT upgraded to the latest firmware.Overall this is a remarkable camera. It is incredibly fast to select the focus and light balance - press the button and it takes the photograph almost instantly - a huge improvement over my D70 and D90 cameras.The negative criticism is as follows:First the camera over exposes photographs in high light level conditions. On the other hand, it is perfect for night-time or low light conditions. In high light, I switch to the 'P' mode and select two stops darker than recommended by the camera. This gives consistently good pictures in higher light levels (cloudless skies for instance). In night time conditions I select 'Auto' mode and get good results.In the 1080p movie modes I see red pixels in the right hand, upper quadrant back-panel. However in the actual content when transferred to computer these fixed red pixels are completely missing. I am told a firmware upgrade MIGHT fix this. The locked pixels are NOT visible in normal photograph modes.The camera records H264 in motion modes. This will need to be translated to 4:2:2 mpeg2 for most decent editors.The focus is hard to force to a specific depth. I want to eliminate foreground fencing and fix to the background focal length - it is a struggle to get the camera to do this - not impossible but you need to read the manual. By comparison the D70 selected the right focal length 80-90% of the time. I feel the camera could benefit from firmware refinement here.After setting up the U1 and U2 program settings I can get consistent results of the highest order (U1 is set for lo-lite, no-flash and U2 is set for hi-lite, panoramic conditions).Overall this is a fantastic camera BUT you should be aware of the following:1. The camera was released \"early\" and definitely needs some refinement - get the latest firmware updates2. The choice of filter is critical. Not all filters work for this camera and you may need some trial-and-error to find the best match. I had a range of twenty filters for the lens, but only four worked out as good choices. If you get bad results, remember the filter MIGHT be the problem.3. This camera is good, even great, but it is not perfect. Play around with the settings, the filters, the lenses. If you are patient you will get outstanding results in a wide range of light conditions. I am retiring my earlier Nikon cameras, several lenses and even more filters (at least until I figure out how to use them on this camera).4. Your older lenses will typically not make full use of this camera, but most of them will work - a sigma lens went through excessive 'hunting' until I removed the filter. I bought a new Nikor/Nikon VR lens with this camera and was impressed. I am retaining about three lenses from my extensive collection including a Macro, panoramic and linear zoom. But I was suitably impressed by the stabilization modes in the new lens. I believe other manufacturers have equivalent solutions. I was shocked by the effectiveness of the image stabilization at 300mm in low light conditions. So I recommend you try at least one VRII (or equivalent) lens with this camera. Focus lock times are similarly exemplary.Despite the above review I absolutely love this camera. I would like to slap Nikon management around the head for their premature release of this camera given the state of firmware development. The VRII lenses are literally amazing. I took night-time shots of fireworks and Christmas lights at the zoo in Las Vegas and the results were exceptional. I dealt with the 'daytime' issues and also got great results.This is NOT the ultimate camera. It needs around 40M Pixel resolution and a smarter computer or at least better firmware. It is also abundantly clear that Nikon underestimated demand and then, rather cynically, forced many buyers to cough up another $200-$400 for a mostly-useless pre-packaged lens. Rubbish management! The 28-300 or an 18-200+ are the minimum lens you should consider unless you have lenses for earlier Nikon cameras. Overall, however, we are rapidly approaching perfection.

I ran through some focus test at home and everything seemed fine. This past weekend I took my daughter out into a wildflower field and thought I was getting once in a lifetime shots. There was perfect lighting on a nice overcast day all things were perfect for a perfect photo shoot. Once I loaded the images up on my PC and took a look I felt like smashing my D7000 with a sledge hammer. Most of the images suffered from back focus problems.(The flowers behind my daughter were in perfect focus) I ran some test using focus charts and can not correct the problem using fine tuning. I needed a camera and already had the D7000 battery grip so I decided to get another D7000 for $850. The new D7000 has right focus issues out of the box. It is going back and all my Nikon gear is getting traded in on Canon stuff. On a side note, I purchased the D600 last month and it went back within 4 days due to the dust and oil problems.

They are simply the BESt on line merchant on the internet. The D7000 is a mixed bag of good and bad. Its extremely quick and responsive.

The ISO performance is outstanding..at least two stops better then D90..acceptable up to 3200 with little post production. The metering is very good and the colors produced are very appealing. The cons..bad fit for large hands..or big glass. The images seemed softer then my D90. I tried everything to make this camera work for me..setting changes ..lens changes..etc..and just could not get any satisfaction for the image quality.

Too bad I did not know this before returning.I would even be willing to try another unit it is that good a camera.

I got a big  box store Black Friday deal on the older but well-praised unit for half-price, $800, complete with a reknowned Nikon 18-140 mm VR zoom lens. The lens alone lists for about $800, so it was a no-brainer purchase at the time. Being somewhat handicapped from a mobility standpoint, I must do most of my buying on-line and don't usually have the luxury of walking the malls and fighting the crowds to see what I'm getting ahead of time. What arrived via UPS was a much larger, heavy metal, weather-sealed, beautifully constructed camera with a hearty 5 lb. lens that made the Nikon D7000 look like the Pinocchio of the DSLR camera world. Overwhelmed by the array of buttons, arthritis- challenging weight, and telephone book-like instruction manual, I dove for the the Quick Start sheet, assembled the lens to the  camera, gently threw on a protective UV filter,  charged the battery, put in a class 10 SD card, and set it on the infamous,  life-saving green, full-auto setting to give it a test run against my trusty, lightweight, mostly plastic, not designed to withstand the elements Canon T3. After anticipating this moment for 3 years and feeling quite proud of the deal I got, I gathered the grandchildren's colorful Christmas toys and packages and set up a night-time test shoot on my bed, using only the pop-up flash and auto setting for each camera. I was prepared to be blown away and already wondering if i should keep or sell the T3. What happened next did shake me to the core, but not in a good way, more in a sad way. In side-by-side comparisons of identical shots taken by each camera, the Canon T3 digita pics were better in every case ( to my eye) as compared to the much more expensive Nikon D7000. Of course, this evaluation is very subjective and hardly intended to be the final word on the on-going Canon VS Nikon debate, but I was disappointed and knew instantly I would never be happy with the new camera, so it's going back tomorrow. I've come to terms with the fact that apparently I love a very lightweight, uncomplicated DSLR that gives me bragging quality shots of the grandkids every weekend with little to no effort on my part except to hold the camera steady as it works its magic. Essentially, though fabulous, though a great deal, the Nikon D7000 was and always will be too much camera for a person like myself. I'm sure with all it's available adjustments, a professional could re-shoot my pics and blow my mind. But the reality is, if you're a happy point and shoot person that wants beautiful pics without hardly any effort in a lightweight, easy to handle and transport mostly plastic package, I heartily recommend keeping your place with your entry level camera, you'll be much happier. I am glad I had this opportunity to test the camera for my particular use, or I'd be spending the rest of my amateur days wishing I could afford better. But now I'm super content, knowing that an entry-level camera like the Canon T3 is perfect for my purposes and skill level.

I tested using the same lens, 18-200, not a particularly sharp lens, but the one I have used regularly, same subjects --- and when looked at at 100% magnification, the difference was very noticeable: the D7000 with a larger sensor is just not as sharp.I also made a comparison, also of flowers in bright light, using a 35MM 1.8 DX and, again, the D80 was superior in both sharpness and also, with this lens, in color quality.

I do digital artwork, which means I photograph everything from landscapes to macro images, and I process everything through Photoshop.  First issue I've noticed with this camera and lens is that it is very slow when used in anything from full manual mode (which solves a great deal of problems).  When you don't rely on the camera to \"make\" your images (auto-focus, white balance, auto-exposure, etc.), you can work around some of the issues.  When I do have to use some of the camera's modes, there are issues of off-and-on crispness.  The lens that came with this package is cheaply made, and engineered so poorly that \"lens creep\" occurs at about 70mm if the camera is held at less than a 90 degree angle.  This throws everything out of whack.I called Nikon service to ask is there was any repair possible on the lens creep issue on the lens.  While they were courteous, it was concluded there was no point in sending in either the body or the lens as they are aware of the problems and have no fix for them. And they offer the Nikon customer nothing, which I find appalling.  Nikon is well aware of the problems with this camera and this lens, and, if they were a responsible company, they would either do a recall, or offer the customer a discount on another model and lens that doesn't have the issues of this one.  But no.  What an arrogant way to do business.At the end of the day, I'm too entrenched in Nikon products (like the great Speed Flash and my fixed distance lenses) to give up the ghost on Nikon.  I'm also not able to spend $7,000 for a pro body.  Adorama offered to take back the whole package, but that doesn't really solve anything other than save up for the better body and hope my lenses are compatible with it.Shame on you, Nikon.

But the controlls of the video is OK but could be better.I played with the Nikon d7000 video a little.  I even bought a Steadicam Jr for it. It took me a couple day to figure out I had to make an adapter plate to make the Steadicam work.  I added a quick release so I can use the camera on the Steadicam Jr and take the camera off quickly.  Here is my observation of the using nikon D7000 for video.1) There is no remote start/stop to turn the video on and off to be use on the steadicam Jr or similar stabilizer.  I have to catch the \"floating\" camera on the Steadicam Jr to turn the recording on and off. So a time delay or remote switch to turn on the video is impossible?2) The D7000 camera is very \"rear\" heavy to compare with a \"normal\" camcorder.  I made an adapter plate to allow the d7000 to work on the Steadicam Jr. Once the adapter plate is installed the Steadicam Jr works fine.3) There is no motorized zoom on the D7000 and zooming is not going to be smooth. It is almost impossible not to stop the recording on the Steadicam Jr to zoom.4) The built-in microphone is so close to the lens, it is picking up the noise of the lens motor when auto focusing is in action.  I am using a old zoom 24-120mm without the silent wave motor.  Other lense could be better.5) I also bought the IR remote controller, however, it will only control the shutter, it will not start/stop of the video remotely.6) No through the lens view finder to see the video means it is difficult if not impossible to take video under bright sun light.Still a great camera for occasional video recording for vacation.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful product, high quality mid-proffessional DSLR from Nikon", "Author": "Ferit Eren Beskardes \"e'eN\"", "ReviewID": "R2CNAB4OQSOPAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nothing to explain or review yet.

SO MUCH SO YOU MIGHT EVEN RETURN THE CAMERA!!!It is a more complex machine with more settings which in term requires a higher learning curve than a d300s.It requires more time and effort on your part (initially) to get better pictures than a d300s.It also requires better glass in low light which results in better pictures at higher iso's.ITS A WANNABE D700......IT DOESN'T SUCCEED...BUT IT COMES CLOSE..but you need to work the inner guts of the camera's settings.. which is a good thing...makes me a better photographer.My only complaint is  the camera buffer in burst mode is inferior. Here's a fact. This camera has a dxo mark equal to the D700, and the canon 5d mk II. For about a grand cheaper. Keep that in mind.Update........Hint...... to get really sharp pics.....lower your iso, use a tripod ,  go to manual mode, minimize shutter speed,  the extensive dynamic range of this camera will take care of itself. And by the way the video is excellent on this camera.....check out the vimeo wEbsite for proof.MANUAL CONTROL OF ISO IS SO IMPORTANT, THE CAMERAS AUTO SETTINGS  PICK ISO IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHUTTER SPEEDS AND F STOPS......SO WITH A CROPPED SENSOR YOU WILL TEND TO SEE LESS SHARP PICTURES AT HIGHER ISOS.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this particular \"Kit.\"", "Author": "JZ", "ReviewID": "R2ORD34UB1DP0F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I gave this item a rating of one star based on the included kit lens only; in my opinion the D7000 camera body itself is great!

I wish I could love it, but this review is for those interested in true hybrid shooting: switching on-the-fly between still image capture and digital filming. I've been trying to find the right camera to use in the field when I have to shoot both stills and short film clips. A \"perfect\" camera doesn't need add-ons to do that... the Nikon D7000 does need them. I'm not hating on the D7000 because Nikon's definitely going in the right direction (by adding things like a socket for an external mic - something that the D90 sorely lacked. It also adds manual adjustment for film recording (people like calling it \"video\" but iPhones take video ... I want to go beyond that YouTube mentality).The D7000 also sports that wonderful 5-6 fps still image capture. Not just a burst of 6 frames, but constant. In Jpeg mode, you can sit on the shutter and capture dozens of images. With the setting in Raw, you can only capture a handful of NEF files before the camera needs to come up for air to write; the image size is actually larger than the D3/D3S.Now for what I feel is the drawback on the hybrid build of these cameras: Each one that has a mirror for shooting images means that you cannot use the eyepiece to shoot clips. Which means that you have to use the rear LCD screen to frame and capture. Taking that camera from cradle shooting (where you cradle the camera in your hands holding it to your eye) will yield camera shake when you extend a two-pound camera away from your body to shoot. And forget about fine-focusing if you're farsighted.You also can't control sound like the camcorders like the ones with the XLR microphone jacks. Our boss plans to get an audio integrator, but they cost $399, and add bulk which goes against the desire to have an camera that doesn't attract attention.One can add a viewfinder for the LCD screen (like the Hoodman) which acts as a loupe, but if you're into shooting both stills and clips, your eye won't be able to access the prism viewfinder. In my own opinion, the need to add these accessories means that development of a great field-use hybrid still has a way to go. I think these cameras should eliminate the shutter mirror. It would allow you to keep the camera close to your face and quickly and seamlessly switch between clips and images. The hybrid camera is moving on a course where this should hopefully happen. I think Lumix now has some cameras that are mirror-free and use an LCD viewfinder. But their image quality is still lacking.Is it that photographers don't want to shoot using an LCD screen? Is there a problem with image jumping when a still is captured, where the image shows for a moment, or breaks away from the live action? I've noticed that with the Lumix cameras that I've shot with, and it makes it difficult to shoot something like football. Focusing isn't nearly as precise as using a prism viewfinder. Some people may be chomping at the bit thinking I'm hating you new-found gem. But I only want to focus on what others genuinely missed in their reviews. It's easy to talk about all that stuff that most write about. But I think this is an important aspect that needs to be explained, for those who want to use a similar camera as a standalone hybrid. We don't have the budget or desire to but external sound boxes, 8-inch monitors, and camera stabilizers. We just want to switch between video and stills without having to add extra gear or move the camera away from our eyes.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "problems after problems", "Author": "tokidoki", "ReviewID": "R34GCNHI2GAPX9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I hate to give this a bad review but I'm so disappointed with Nikon.

Nikon is slow in DLSR technology and very stingy in offering to its users.The camera is feature rich, which does not require me to say. However, it gave me frustrations at basic levels for photography. Personally, its new 39 point focus system is with major flaws. It cannot focus when I try to take pictures at my nephews birthday party. The light condition was NOT bad. The lens was 28-70 f2.8 AFS. The auto focus setting was 39 points Auto-A. I tried to use manual focus override but the two focus indicator arrow kept blinking and the in focus circle never came up. No focus point was highlighted. The camera locked up. I had switch the camera off and on. The problem repeated several times while I was taking pictures at the party. The same lens was used on this D7000 to take 500 pictures before this happened. And it never happened again with the same lens and camera for the next 500 pictures. It was this particular scene where the camera failed on me. If you read reviews from dpreview.com and popular photography etc., you will find its picture quality is OK but no upto the competitions at this price level. Poor video shooting.There is only minimun improvement on resolution compared to D90, while its color accuracy and noise level are worse. The new focus system is a joke, making no improvement over D90, speed and accuracy.

Low light performance was my #1 priorority and the d7k was the best in the price range.So finally, my camera arrives. Box looks brand new, body looks absolutely flawless and it was, in fact, under 2k actuactions. AWESOME!Within a few days, I noticed that it would give me random errors writing to either of the Sandisk EXTREME 16gb class 10 cards. The camera becomes unusable until you pull both cards and the battery. Not only that - but the image you were trying to shoot whenever you get the error - is gone. Doesn't exist. Great, as a concert photographer - you get 9 minutes to shoot images - and I'm spending a 3rd of that time now pulling my memory cards and powering down so my nearly brand new sub-par Nikon can continue to shoot.I lived through that until this weekend, when about every 10th image now gives me an error and requires the cards to be pulled/etc. I e-mailed Nikon right away with this problem when I started receiving it, and they told me to send it in and pay them to service it.Yes, you want me to pay you to fix a camera that has been defective since the day it was shipped from your factory? Not only that - you want me to be without a camera for 6 weeks while you diagnose/fix it. I've tried 3 different brands of class 10 SD cards and still get this error - along with lots of other people who made the mistake of buying this body.I plan on slamming this body on every site selling it that I can find. Amazon, B&H;, whatever. Also, I will be slamming Nikon on every social media site I'm a part of AS WELL AS never recommending anything be bought from your company.Instead of buying a d7000 - I would recommend to everyone that is looking - buy a $5 paperweight and a 7D. I made the mistake of just buying a $1200 paperweight.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad experience about Nikon D7000", "Author": "doc", "ReviewID": "R2M339EBHX329T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Recently I bought a Nikon D7000 for Nikon's name and returned it for its bad quality.Before last Thanksgiving my friend helped me to order a Nikon D7000 with 18-200mm zoom from Costco. We had good price - $1699.99 ($2049.99 - $350 rebate) from Costco.At first I loved it and I even bought a Nikkor 10-24mm, filters and remote control  for it. The camera is less three months old and only took 115 pictures. And I found problem about this D7000.According to D7000 manual, after a full charge it can take 1050 photoes (Nikon's standard is much higher - 4500 photoes each charge). But In my D7000's first run it only took 115 photoes after the initial full charge. Battery meter said the battery's age is 0 (means barrery is brand new) and battery meter is only 1% with 115 pictures taken . This is a brand new D7000 with brand new battery, the battery life is only 10% of D7000 manual specified. I do not know this is a camera's problem or a battery's problem.In order to solve this problem. I searched manual and could not find a phone number. Late I found a 800 number from web and called, the service person could not advise what I should do - seems he do not know D7000 at all.  I posted questions in Nikon's web site but they send me a mail talking about somethings else - seems they even have not read my questions at all.  I updated my question several times but no further response.Today (Feb 13, 2012) is the last day I can return my D7000 in Costco, so I went to Costco. At first I just wanted to exchange the questionable D7000 but they told me I cannot exchange it. Then the service gay said Costco could return me a full price of $2049.99 that makes I can buy a same camera with today's market price. Late Costco guys took their words back (so bad for Costco because they can eat their word just in a few minutes ) and only agree to return me $1699,99- that is not enough to buy another D7000 with lens today. Because today is last day I can return, I asked if Costco can extend the return period for a few days that makes me can call Nikon again.  Costco guy did not agree to give me a few more days. So I returned this bad Nikon D7000 with lens immediately. Next I need to returm my Nikkor 10-24mm lens and filter because it is uselee without D7000.NIkon is a well known company.  I do not know why they allow this kind of expensive camera to go to market with problem and do not provide good customer service. Or Nikon do know the Nikon D7000 sold in Costco has quality problem so Nikon gave $350 rebate to lure customers to order. Or Nikon' Thaland factory does not has ISO qualily control system.By the way this camera and lens are made in Thaland. And I have a 18-105mm lens made in Thaland which coating is very bad.

The sixth one had only one, faint pixel so I kept it. The camera meter is terrible. For example, couldn't set proper exposure on auto when trying to photograph a person wearing a light blue shirt in daylight. Nikon told me that you need \"sufficient contrast\" (Their term) for the meter to work and a person wearing a light blue shirt standing in New York City on a sunny day apparently didn't satisfy that.36 days after I got the camera, the shutter would start locking up and I would get an ERR message in the LCD display. I called Nikon and they asked me to send it in at my own expense for repair. 3 weeks later the camera came back and now it doesn't recognize any CPU lenses. Nikon wants me to send it back in again at my expense. I have since called American Express and asked them to deal with this and get me my money back. I just don't want to bother with repairing this or sending it in to Nikon again. Not worth it.Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.I was upgrading from film to digital and having been a like-long Nikon film user, I was expecting the same level of quality with this camera.

Perhaps most importantly is the fact that this camera does not use film cartridges.  Instead, you use computer disks that hold hundreds of photos and have a range of built-in ISOs.  Notably, there is no loud winding noise when removing a full disk...it's virtually silent--a welcomed change for wedding/event photographers.Secondly, there is a large screen on the camera's back for viewing the pictures that you just took.  The screen also lets you access an internal computer where you use various lists for customization and effects.  For example, you can change from color to black and white with a few button maneuvers.  After a few weeks, I still haven't used all the computer options.When you're done shooting (wedding, sports, etc.), set your computer to \"Import\" and you can review on the PC's monitor.  Then simply select \"Print All\" to print all the photos.
