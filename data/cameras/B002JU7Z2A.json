Carey \"Busy Mom of Two\"", "ReviewID": "RWGIIRE4IA4RK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter as a beginner camera. I thought it would last a little longer than it did helping her to learn the basic fundamentals of camera function and transfer of pictures. Wanted to wait for a more expensive camera until she knew a little more about what she's doing with a camera. But, you get what you pay for and less in this case.It broke after only a couple hours of use. It took about 15-20 pictures, she tried to plug the cord into the camera and that part broke. It's like there's nothing in the camera to stop the plug from going back into the camera. And, we can't get the camera open without actually damaging the housing unit. Very cheaply made, a waste of money, and an upset little girl on Christmas day. And, she was gentle with it taking care of her new prized possession.Can't rate the software or anything else since we couldn't even get the camera plugged in to transfer her pictures or try out the software. It's going in the trash and we'll be taking advantage of the after Christmas sales to get a better name brand beginner camera.Don't waste your time or money on this camera......", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$9.99", "Features": "3-in-1 digital camera/PC-web video camera and keychain\nTake up to 70 photos and video chat with friends on the internet\nEquipped with built-in SDRAM\nIncluded PhoTags photo editing software\nAlso comes with a special USB cable and a 1-year warranty", "Name": "Pink Digital Camera on a Key Chain", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516hHHA5HHL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002JU7Z2A"}}
