The DVR system we ordered came with 8 bullet cameras.  However, he's got low ceilings and felt the bullet camera could easily be vandalized.  As such, we ordered this camera, which is protected by the dome.  The image/video captured by this unit is very clear.  The unit comes with cables (50ft I believe), connectors and a power adapter.Installation is very straight forward, and the mounting bracket installs easily.  Definitely a good quality product.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R2G9RIB1HRWH1V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Swann has great products I would reconmend this camera to my many clients.
