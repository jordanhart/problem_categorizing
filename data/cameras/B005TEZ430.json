All lights operated as normal and I could access the configuration page of the device and there too, it shows only blue as if there is no video signal. I swapped cameras to a known working camera and still nothing. I contacted Trendnet technical support and while pleasant the 1st level support informed me I would have to wait 24 to 48 hours for a call back. My customer needed this camera back in service ASAP so I found one on Amazon and paid for Saturday delivery. Swapped the old unit for the new and it worked just fine again. I called Trendnet back to explain the situation and I am once again told I have to wait for technician to call me back. This will not work out as I am rarely at home or anywhere near the unit. So at this point I am assuming I am out the money. The unit worked great when it worked but dying in less than a year is a bit soon. This maybe a fluke but I will stay away from this product going forward. Had support provided an RMA after I explained the story, I would've maybe rated higher.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005TEZ430"}}
