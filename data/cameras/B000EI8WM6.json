{"Reviews": [{"Title": "L2 is sharper", "Author": "OldEngineer", "ReviewID": "R330ZLBN07375P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The L2 and L3 models are twins with a shared instruction manual.  For some the more expensive L2 may be a better choice.At a camera store I made several identical shots with both cameras and the L2 produced consistently sharper images when zoomed in on the fine detail of ordinary shots.  (Using readability of distant text to judge sharpness of jpg images saved in the largest file size.)With simpler menus than higher priced cameras these seem to be a good choice for the less determined photographer in your family.  I am going to use mine as a backup for an older pocket digital on a trip and ultimately as a spouse's camera.  While she likes 4X6 prints, for which the L3 would be fine, I will keep her files and view them on computer and so chose the extra sharpness.This is a very likeable little camera that is significantly smaller than my older digital.  To keep that size advantage I found a Tamrac slip in case with Velcro closure flap at a photo chain store with many cases to choose from.--On a trip the L2's daylight photos and videos were very good and the Best Shot Selector a fine feature, however the weak flash was a serious limitation in many situations.  Some dark images were improved by a feature Nikon calls \"D-lighting\".  In dark situations my old digital produced far better images.  I would subtract one star if Amazon would let me edit the rating.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "A good buy", "Author": "A Reader", "ReviewID": "R35F2VQWZYSE88", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited to review this camera until I'd really put it through the paces on a 10-day trip to Paris, where I used it in pretty much every conceivable scenario: indoor, outdoor, sunny, cloudy, closeup (macro), high zoom, videos in the day and night, etc.  I've explored all of its features at this point, including all of the scene modes (panorama included).This is a good camera.  To my thinking, the single best feature is the \"D-Lighting\" option.  This feature is an automatic color/lighting adjustment tool that one accesses when in \"play mode\" (viewing previously-taken pictures).  It's a very smart feature that will compensate for poor lighting situations.  I used this on almost every picture I took.  The panorama feature is also nice--it's used in conjunction with the bundled software Nikon includes with the camera.  Video mode is quite good--with a 2GB card, and tuned to a lower quality (smaller) video mode, you can actually get a couple hours of video on this thing.I'd recommend this camera for amateur/casual use--it's very intuitive, and will suit those not inclined to gadgetry and technology.  Also a VERY good first camera for a teen.  It's certainly not the best thing out there, but it's inexpensive and takes excellent pictures at 5.1 MP.  Also, the AA battery life is long, and makes it easy to keep the camera powered, even in a foreign country using a different voltage (no recharging necessary, just replace the batteries).  Very lightweight, and can be tucked into a pant pocket.Some shortcomings: the biggest flaw is that the camera has no HOLD function--that is, there's no way to disable the on/off button without removing the batteries.  Thus, if you put the camera in your pocket and the power button is unintentionally pressed, the camera will turn on, and the lens will try to open.  This may lead to the \"lens jamming\" other reviewers have complained of.  This was an annoyance, though one I easily overcame by removing one battery in situations where I thought it might be an issue.  Also, if the lens tries to open but can't, the camera will shut down and display a \"lens error\" message.  This might drain the battery, but, in my experience, won't seriously hurt the camera.  Another shortcoming, though one shared by most cameras in this price-range, is that it lacks the aperture to take really good sharp pictures in low-lighting situations, without a tripod.  The small lens simply can't gather enough light fast enough to get detailed nighttime city-scapes, for instance.  Anything beyond the range of the flash (which is good) will be dark or blurry.  The same problem might confront a user in a museum where flash is prohibitied.  Unless you have a tripod or a very steady hand, the pictures are likely to turn out blurry.  Finally, several users have complained that the memory-writing process is slow--that is, after taking a picture you have to wait several seconds while the camera saves the picture before you can take another one.  This is true.  My understanding is that some of this has to do with the write-speed of the memory card you purchase, but some of it also has to do with the camera itself.  Not recommended for situations in which you'll want to snap off several pictures in quick succession.On the whole, I think this camera is an excellent value that will suit most needs.  I'm glad I got it, but I also know that it won't satisfy more demanding users.", "Date": "April 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "hate it", "Author": "tiff \"tiff threlkeld\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q5NZU4VWWHQW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera takes decent pictures but it has a lot of problems.

The 3x optical zoom is a simple rocker switch, positioned so that it's accessible while holding the camera with one hand, as opposed to the awkward combination arrow pad / zoom arrangements on other cameras. The menu is set up so that the most common options are displayed first, rather than forcing you to scroll down through innumerable pages. It takes plain old AA batteries and has a tripod mount, two essential features that are often inexplicably omitted from cameras in this size. With the exception of the odd plastic cover for the USB port, it's superbly put together.The quality of the \"normal\" 5MP pictures is unfortunately not that great, but it looks good when you use \"fine\" mode. Shutter lag is OK, a second or so, though it can be set up to fire continuously while the shutter is held down. The \"Scene mode\" promises better pictures, including detecting faces in portraits, but I haven't seen any noticeable difference. The video quality is decent, though the grinding noise of the autofocus mechanism means that you have to use a fixed focal length if you care at all about the audio.Overall, it's a fine camera to stick in your pocket.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nikon L3 - great outside, lousy inside", "Author": "Richard C.

We bought this one after going through a couple of other ones in the past 5+ years.  I have had several point & shoot digital cameras of my own.  This camera is, by far, the WORST camera I have ever used.  The main reason for this is that all pictures taken indoors are extremely dark.  We bought 3 of these for work, and all three of them have the same issue with the dark pictures, so it's not just mine in particular. The camera has a feature called D-lighting that you can use after a picture is taken, which lightens the whole picture. It does help lighten a picture, but it has to be done for each and every indoor picture, which is a huge pain, to say the least.  And, when you use the feature, it saves the lighter one but still keeps the bad/dark one.  So after I use D-lighting for each and every picture, I had to go back and delete the bad/dark one.  Because the camera has this feature, it makes me think that Nikon knew that the dark pictures were a problem to begin with.  What I finally ended up having to do was put the setting on \"night portrait\" for all indoor pictures. It makes the pictures lighter, but it takes a really long time to reset and be ready for the the next shot.  The other issue with this camera is that if anyone is moving at all, the picture will be slightly blurred.

There are lots of scene modes and the overall usability of the camara is terrific.  The main thing that is terrible about this camara is it takes remarkably horrible indoor images.

An alternative is to use the party/indoor mode, but these turn out blurry if there is any movement, and are too bright, while doing a good job of color reproduction.  An in camara feature allows you to brighten normal shots, but then they look unusual.  However, because of the ease of use, excellent image quality overall, this is a good camara.

From that point you can use the Windows Camera and Scanner Wizard to download images easily from the camera, if you don't want to get involved with specialized software.Since the Guide didn't make this point clear, I phoned Nikon Support (which is 24/7) and was shocked when the phone was immediately answered:  no hold time at all (during normal business hours; there was a wait outside those hours).", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Buyer beware-buy the replacement warranty", "Author": "C.

I attribute this to the auto-iso feature; (I would love to have been able to preset the ISO setting to see if it made a difference).
