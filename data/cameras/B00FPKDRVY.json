{"Reviews": [{"Title": "X-E2 perfect for the analog photo experience enthusiast", "Author": "J. Strand", "ReviewID": "RRYQDOWWSMQ9C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really fantastic camera if you're an enthusiast who enjoys adjusting settings, playing with film modes and getting really high quality photos without having to carry a much bulkier camera or pay thousands for a Leica.If you want a camera you can set on sports/portrait/landscape or \"green\" and click away. or you think P stands for \"Professional mode\" this camera is not for you.  Yes, you can set aperture, shutter speed and ISO to auto and shoot, and there are a few modes like panorama, toy or miniature mode but to really enjoy the camera you need to be familiar with exposure and how to adjust for it.I have the X-E1 and takes great shots but it has three shortcomings that matter to me.  Focus wasn't fast enough, the electronic viewfinder, though beautiful, would stutter if you moved quickly and you couldn't set a minimum shutter speed.  These issues don't bother a lot of people who don't shoot moving objects but they did bother a lot of people and Fuji has addressed all three issues (among others) and focus is now very very fast, the electronic view finder is the same one as in the X-E1 but a better processor means it's smooth as butter and you can now set a minimum shutter speed!Other improvements include a screen that's just a little bigger but has about twice the pixels and the change of placement of a few buttons for the better.  There's also a new lens correction feature called the Lens Modulation Optimizer that I doubt you'll ever notice unless you're a pixel peeper and there's one new feature I'm, so far, unimpressed with and that's the new split image focusing.  Maybe I'm holding it wrong ;-) but I just barely see the split image box.  I've owned the Leica M9 so I'm really familar with the concept but on the M9 though the focus box was smaller it was much more visible.  Perhaps it's just a result of shooting mostly using one particular background so I'll give it more chances in other situations.The only other downside I have is the battery indicator.  I usually get 300-400 shots on a charge, and since I have the X-E1  and they use the same battery I now have two batteries so I won't be running out of power anytime soon, but the battery indicator isn't accurate.  Twice recently a battery has gone from four bars to three bars to one bar skipping right over two bars.  On the positive side another new feature of the X-E2 is improved power management.  You can now set the camera to only use the electronic view finder.  When you put the camera to your eye the viewfinder will turn on like usual but the LCD will never be on.  You can review pics and adjust the menu using the viewfinder and this should save a lot of battery life as the LCD is the main drain on it.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "An impressive camera.

than my Nikon D300 DSLR. The latter camera, with it's battery grip, large 18-55mm f2.8 lens and hot shoe mounted flash is a very large camera to haul around. Yes, the pictures I get from it are phenomenal but it is just not convenient to always have to carry such a monstrosity around.This is a sophisticated camera that will reward the more experienced photographer and not one that an amateur might appreciate as much. You will not find most of the \"scene modes\" that you find on most point & shoot cameras... like Fireworks, Candlelight, Sports, Portrait, etc. You can have full manual control of all aspects of the camera... ISO, Aperture, Shutter Speed, Exposure Compensation, bracketing, function buttons, the whole shebang... it's pretty powerful. In fact, this is the first camera I've owned in quite a while where I felt I really needed to dive into the manual to read up on everything. And get this... this camera comes with an honest to goodness manual. Hallelujah! You mean I don't have to struggle with a cheesy quick start pamphlet and then visit a website to download a PDF of the manual? No... it actually comes with a manual. 130 pages.I've tried using several other smaller cameras including a Lumix DMC-LX5, Nikon Coolpix L110, several Canon Elph models the most recent of which was the PowerShot Elph 110HS but have continually found them lacking in so many ways as to make me revert back to my bulky DSLR. They all could take sometimes great photos but they were also deficient in many ways whether it be lousy low-light performance, inability to shoot indoors very well, or capture shots of fidgety children.The Fujifilm X-E2 is spectacular to behold in a very understated and retro kind of way. It's got pebble-grain leather covering the body... how many cameras have pebble-grain leather covering the body? I mean, maybe 30-40 years ago, but not today. But don't let what it looks like on the outside fool you into thinking it isn't up-to-date inside.Included Accessories:\u27a4 Rechargeable battery NP-W126 1260mAh\u27a4 Battery charger\u27a4 Body cap\u27a4 CD-ROM\u27a4 Metal Strap Clips\u27a4 Clip attaching tool\u27a4 Owners manual\u27a4 Shoulder Strap\u27a4 Front Lens Cap\u27a4 Rear Lens Cap\u27a4 Lens Hood\u27a4 Camera BodyIt's not as small a body as you might think. It feels quite good in the hand. I feel I can grip the camera securely because it has a very understated yet effective hand-grip and rear thumb rest. It really is a two-handed camera. It's a solid camera and feels extremely well-built. You'll immediately notice that the dials are not plastic but substantial machined metal. A feeling of real quality. There is no squeaking or creaking of the body as it is handled due to the fact that the top and base plates are fabricated of die-cast magnesium alloy. It gives the camera a feeling of rigidity.\u27a4 Camera SensorIt's packing some worthy stuff on the inside as well including a 16.3 megapixel APS-C, X-Trans CMOS II sensor. This sensor gives the camera a crop factor of 1.5 meaning a 18mm-55mm lens will be equivalent to 27mm-82mm in a 35mm format. It is this sensor, that helps provide excellent image quality and superior low-light performance with absolutely minimal noise and useable high ISO settings.\u27a4 The Electronic Viewfinder and LCD displayThere is no optical viewfinder but rather a 3\" LCD display on the back and one of the best OLED Electronic Viewfinders I've seen. I'm not a big fan of EVF's but this one is at least good enough not to dissuade me from using it. The viewfinder has a diopter adjustment on the left side. I have no problem using the viewfinder with my glasses.Both the LCD and EVF provide a 100% view of the shot which eliminates the guesswork of what is and is not going to end up in the photo. I've never been a fan of Electronic Viewfinders but this one may change my mind because it is quite good. You can actually see all of the information in the EVF that you would normally see on the larger LCD screen. And a really cool feature is that as soon as you hold the camera up to your eye, a sensor automatically turns the EV on while turning off the back LCD because of an eye sensor on the right side of the viewfinder. You can configure how you'd like this to work. The EV does have a bit of lag in really low light and I do have some issues with EVF's in low light for other reasons. But it is far better than any electronic viewfinder I've ever used before.\u27a4 LensThis camera can use interchangeable lenses but comes with a very worthy 18-55mm lens with an aperture range of f/2.8-4. That's a pretty fast lens and in conjunction with the ability to shoot at high ISO settings this camera excels at taking great photos with available light and super great shots in low-light that other cameras would do poorly in.\u27a4 Focus SpeedThis camera with the 18-55mm kit lens focuses very quickly. If you have the \"pre-AF\" on, you will find even faster final focusing when you're ready to take a shot. The AF illuminator LED helps in low light situations. I am not too pleased with the positioning of the LED itself as it is very easy to block it while holding the camrea with your right hand depending on how you grip the camera.\u27a4 Start-up time and shutter lagI've missed so many shots with other cameras when waiting for the camera to turn on. Interminable delays of a few seconds startup time are a thing of the past with the X-E2. This thing starts up and is ready to fire in just 0.5 seconds. It's that fast. And shutter lag is nearly imperceptible. Trying to get shots of kids running around, or other action shots requires a camera with a very low shutter lag so that you can capture the moment at the exact instant you need to. The X-E2 has a really short shutter lag... so short that it is not even really noticeable. And the camera is fast to write to memory so that you only begin to notice a short between shots delay if you've filled the buffer with rapid shots. But even then you are ready to go in just a few seconds.\u27a4 Image QualityYou can shoot in Fine, Normal, Fine + RAW, Normal + RAW or RAW.Movies are H.264 (MOV) with stereo sound.\u27a4 Memory CardThe camera can use SD/SDHC/SDXC cards\u27a4 Battery and ChargerI'm very frustrated that the camera does not support in-camera battery charging via USB. On numerous occasions I have found myself with a dead battery and no charger. If the camera had supported in camera charging, it would have been a trivial action to connect it to an AC USB charger or USB car charger or even a higher capacity batterypack to charge the camera battery. But unfortunately that is not possible with this camera. Best advice is to have at least one additional fully charged battery with you.I do not find the shutter sound to be excessively loud. Rather it is a soft clunk. To me it sounds of quality.You have a lot of customization options with the function button and a \"Q\" button can be used to quickly access and adjust many camera settings. This is awesome as it eliminates the need to wade through levels of menu options to change a setting. This allows much quicker access to what you need to change.This is a beautiful functional camera.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Camera I've Been Waiting For", "Author": "Relentless \"skepticalbeliever\"", "ReviewID": "R5M5R1O1OBJ4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a strictly technical review of this camera, you'd be much better served reading through the dozens of professional and objective reviews there are for this camera. I'm writing this review for the photography enthusiast that's more concerned about the whole experience than isolated technical bits.For nearly a decade I've been waiting for this camera. I've been through Canon Rebels, 5D Mark II, S95, and more recently with the venerable and competent Olympus OMD EM5. But all of them were missing something something that's crucial to me: the photography experience. In a hyper-competitive, cut-throat market manufactures try to cram more and more features in their cameras to meet demand. This translates to \"jack of all trades, master of none\". I did not and do not care about all the bells and whistles or extras. I care the most about one thing: taking awesome photos. To that end, this camera, X-E2, is the absolute best camera I've owned.You will absolutely love this camera if:* you care about photography more than any other feature* love shooting in JPEG with *zero* noise (I've pixel peeped 1:1 and even 3:1) up to ISO 1600* miss the the photography experience (choosing film, lenses, etc.) of the \"old times\"* enjoy the tactile aspect of holding a well-designed, sturdy camera on your hands* looking for an out-of-this-world color-faithful EVF* love bringing your camera in your travelsYou might want to consider a different camera if:* you shoot a lot of video* you care about stuff like camera apps (\"smart camera\")* you like shooting high-speed, fast-moving subjects* you are looking for a point-and-shoot upgrade* you're not completely obsessed with photographyAs an aside: calling the amazing 18-55/2.8-4 lens a 'kit' lens is blasphemy. That lens is simply amazing. Right at par with many Canon \"L\" lenses I've owned and used that cost 4X as much. So, if you do not own Fuji glass already, I cannot recommend the 'kit' combo enough. It will blow your mind, I guarantee it.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Returned a X-E1 and purchased the X-E2.", "Author": "AndrewCCM \"Andrew - Crystal Clear Media\"", "ReviewID": "R1FO2U4FDRI0CC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Both bodies are very good.  The upgrades of the E2 are incremental and not revolutionary.  While it focuses about the same speed as my X100S, don't believe the hype about its \"best in class speed\" etc.  fact is, it's adequate for this type of camera.  It still hunts in backlit, low contrast and/or low light.  It's ok and I wouldn't say that it's a big problem, but don't be expecting to shoot moving objects with a lot of success unless you zone focus.  The Image quality is top notch (which is my primary reason for purchasing it). Ergonomics good, dials are firmer which is an upgrade over previous model.  If you have shot with a X100S, this is basically and interchangeable lens version of that body sans the OVF.  Improvements could be made in the video functionality and AF speed.  But I'd still give this camera a strong buy for the IQ, mechanical features and first class glass.  Not replacing my DSLRs...but is definitely my carry around and vacation camera.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "A superb camera, if not the fastest focusing.", "Author": "Anthony Pantliano \"The Photo Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2IGZ7OFR48G04", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Fuji X-E2 is a well-built camera with excellent photo quality and a very nice kit lens, but if you plan on shooting lots of fast action it may not be the camera for you.The X-E2 is a handsome, retro styled camera.  It's extremely well made, with predominately metal construction.  The camera feels solid in the hand, and despite its sturdy construction, is not a burden to carry around all day.  In fact compared to my Canon 7D, it's light as a feather.  On the front is a modest rubberized grip while a thumb rest is on the back.  Together they make it easy to get a good grip on the Fuji.  The front grip looks removable, but is not.  The kit lens is also nicely made, with a metal finish and smooth operation. Despite its high build quality, the Fuji had a speck of dust on the sensor when I unboxed it that I had to remove manually.In operation the Fuji is very easy to use.  On the top of the camera is a dedicated shutter speed knob and on the lens is an aperture ring.  By using the shutter speed knob and aperture ring it very easy to switch between program mode (both the shutter speed and aperture are set to auto position), shutter or aperture priority (set only one parameter to auto), or fully manual (choose both the shutter speed and aperture yourself).  Overall, it's quick to learn and does not impede the shooting process.  One quirk of this system is that to choose shutter speeds not marked on the knob you need to spin the rear control dial, but it's very quick to get used to.  Additionally, not all X series lenses have a dedicated aperture ring, and for those you'll adjust aperture using the camera body.  There are dedicated controls for exposure compensation, focus lock, exposure lock, metering, drive mode, and focus mode.  There's also the \"Q\" button (which brings up a screen to change other important shooting settings), and two function buttons that can be customized (I set mine to ISO and movie recording).  As you can see the Fuji is covered in buttons and dials, and it makes changing settings simple and straightforward.  Overall, I really enjoy shooting with it.To compose and review photos with the Fuji you'll use either the 3.0\" screen on the back or the electronic viewfinder.  The electronic viewfinder is large (though not as big as the 7D's optical viewfinder), bright, and high resolution.  While it's not as clear as looking through an optical viewfinder, it is nice to be able to navigate menus, review photos, and perform magnified manual focusing without removing your eye from the camera.  While I still prefer the \"reality\" that an optical viewfinder gives, the X-E2's electronic viewfinder is an excellent substitute.  The LCD screen on the back of the Fuji is also bright, sharp, and easy to see in all light conditions.  There is an eye sensor by the electronic viewfinder that will automatically switch from the viewfinder to the screen.The Fuji's performance is a bit of a mixed bag.  While it turns on and is ready to shoot in only 2 seconds, I find the focus speed to be a touch slow overall.  The Fuji takes about 1 second to lock focus, and while this may not sound like a long time it just doesn't feel as responsive as my Canon 7D.  Additionally, I found that it had a hard time locking focus on quickly moving objects.  Aside from that the Fuji's focus system works well, and will be more than adequate for most situations.  Moreover, it focuses accurately 99% of the time, and focus times are the same whether shooting at wide angle or telephoto or in bright light or low light (just be careful not to block the autofocus illumination light as it's right by the grip).  The Fuji was able to focus when light levels dropped to a single 60 watt bulb in a 15' x 10' room, but in those conditions it will occasionally fail to find focus the first time on close objects.  Manually focusing can feel a bit odd since you're not really moving the lens elements yourself, but rather telling the camera to move them for you, so it can feel a bit delayed and unsatisfying.  The Fuji offers magnified view, split image focusing, and focus peaking, to help you get accurate focus.  There are two continuous shooting speeds offered and the Fuji will take 7 RAW or RAW + JEPG images before slowing down.  If you're shooting JPEGs only you'll get 18 images at full speed before the Fuji slows.  Keeping up with movement accurately can be a bit difficult as the Fuji's live view stutters a little bit while continuous shooting.Photo quality is where the X-E2 shines.  The Fuji's sensor is every bit as good as any other APS-C sensor and give images with lots of detail, and low noise.  Indeed I find the Fuji's high ISO images are distinctly cleaner than those of my Canon 7D, and have plenty of detail to work with.  I'll very happily shoot up to ISO 3200 all day long with the Fuji and not worry.  The sensitivities above 3200 are good as well, but I'll reserve those for emergency use only as they start to get a bit crunchy looking.  The Fuji gets exposure correct 99% of the time.  Color is also excellent and realistic without looking flat.  I do most of my shooting in RAW and use Lightroom for editing since I like to tweak my images and alter the highlights and shadows.  However, even if you shoot only JPEGs you'll get excellent results.  In fact the Fuji gives up very little when you shoot JPEG, creating images with excellent noise control and detail retention.  The Fuji's built in flash is pretty powerful and I was able to light up a subject from about 12 feet away at ISO 100.  It can also be pulled backward to serve as a bounce flash.The kit lens is also excellent.  Its zoom strength is nothing special, but it covers a good walk around range.  What's great about this kit lens is the aperture.  It starts at f/2.8 at the wide end and only closes down to f/4 at the long end.  Compared to most kit lenses these apertures are great, and will not only give you shallower depth of field but also allow you to shoot in lower light without having to raise your ISO speed.  The lens shows very consistent results throughout the zoom range.  Even wide open at wide angle sharpness is high and the corners hold up very well.  Lastly, there is very little purple fringing to be found.Movies are recorded in stereo sound in full HD at 60 fps.  You can use the zoom when filming but you have to be smooth or it will look jerky.  Additionally when you zoom and the Fuji refocuses it's not always instantly, sometime it has to hunt.  The quality of the movies is high with good picture and sound in good light.  In low light things can get a bit grainy.Battery life is pretty good.  I was able to take a couple hundred photos before the battery died, with a lot of photo reviewing and menu navigation.All in all... an excellent all around enthusiast camera, but not for those who shoot a lot of action.02/24/2014 Update: Fuji released a firmware update for both the camera and kit lens.  The camera now works better with Fuji's 56mm f/1.2 lens.

Below are some remarks.The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is better than the X-Pro1 and has been doing well in all my lighting situations (low light to normal) at this time. I really love the resolution of it. It refreshes well at low light. Pair that with the new focusing features and you should have no problem getting things in critical focus via manual focus. I've been shooting with my X-Pro1's EVF 90% of the time using the optical viewfinder for key pre-framed \"decisive moment\" shots. I really don't miss the OVF and have adjusted shooting with out it.The focusing is the obvious selling point and there is a big difference coming from an X-Pro1 user. The phase detect integration has been put to good use and I do notice a jump in speed and less time in searching for focus. There would be times where the camera would still miss focus for simple things (e.g. an environmental portrait indoors), but I think that could be improved with firmware updates.The thing is also pretty to look at and hold. It's essentially the same body as the prior X-cameras, just refined. From an X-Pro owner, i appreciate it's size, a little smaller, but still feels good in hand. I used to gaffer tape the system light so it doesn't look like I'm shooting, now I just need to cover the light with my thumb. The sparing use of red combines well with the sparing use of red on my camera lens. The thing is just aesthetically pleasing.Now there are some things I don't like that are important for me to state with only one thing I don't think they would be able to fix.I don't like their removal of the view mode and the inability to be flexible in what's viewable on screen and on EVF. To get to a place to adjust will take multiple clicks on a 1 level menu a few tabs down. I don't like the current lack of RAW support (for Adobe Lightroom 5, PS CC). I still do prefer to shoot RAW, even if their JPEGs come out flawless, as I appreciate the control I get. These will most likely be fixed in due time. I respect how fast these issues get addressed by fuji, still a major pain to wait (that RAW support issue really messed up my plans though).(Update: 12/24/13: Adobe's RAW support now supports XE-2 RAW Output)One more noticeable thing is in its hardware design. The high quality LCD screen doesn't cover the whole LCD screen frame. There's a bar to the right that's not used, ever. I would call that poor planning.In the end, I still enjoy this camera. The image quality takes this thing home. Most of the R-type in-house lenses are top notch throughout the aperture range and really complement the camera's capabilities well. The autofocus has really improved. Using the camera is still a joy and I love how well it handles.If you're a X-Pro1 user, this camera is a very worthy upgrade and worth consideration. If you're new to the Fuji line, this is a great camera to jump in as a lot of prior issues (showstoppers for some) have been addressed (except sports-style shooting).

I thought I wanted a full frame camera, but I could never justify spending that kind of money on a hobby.  One of the main reasons was that I had sort of got out of the habit of shooting as much as I used.  Part of the reason was that it always seemed like such a pain to lug around the camera.  There were always times I wish I had a camera, but didn't.This camera solves a lot of that for me.  Take the lens off the body and the thing literally fits in your pocket.  Leave it on and it fits nicely in my car's center console.  It feels nice in my hands, although I bought the metal thumb grip at the same time as the camera and must admit that does help quite a bit.Compared to my 50d (which is a little long in the tooth) the image quality is superior.  The color reproduction in particular seemed to be good.  It also seemed to perform better at higher ISOs than my 50d does.  Really, the only area where the 50d still out-performs the XE-2 is how fast the autofocus works.  The XE-2 is good, but my 50d is still a touch better.  Maybe a firmware update will improve this.Despite using a Canon products for almost a decade, I found I really like the controls on this camera.  I found it really easy and intuitive to change the shutter speed and aperature.  ISO and most of the other frequently used settings are easily reached by hitting the Q button.  The layout could be tweaked a little, but overall it's pretty good.I've never had a camera with wifi, but it's a feature that's gotten more use than I thought it would.  Being able to transmit pictures to Facebook, Twitter, or whatever is really simple once you upload the photo from the camera using Fuji's app.  I don't post a lot of pictures online, but that may change a little bit now that it is a lot simpler.The build quality is really good and the included kit lens is really nice.  The screen is sharp and the EVF is clear.  Like I mentioned before, the size of the frame is nice and compact and is much easier to take along wherever you go.Is this a replacement for a full frame DSLR?  No.  Is it a good alternative for a crop sensor DSLR?  In my opinion, absolutely.  First, the price and performance makes it very competitive.  Second, the size is going to be tough to beat.  Finally, for me at least, it is a camera I am more likely to use more and take with me more places.  As other's have mentioned about this camera though, if you like putting everything on automatic or different shooting modes (sports, portrait, landscape, etc) then this camera is probably not for you.

Brodsky", "ReviewID": "R1HPHGZMR83TFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned most higher end digital cameras released in the last 7 years.  I've owned Canons to 5D Mark 3 and Nikons to D800 (my present Nikon).  I've also owned most m43 cameras (Olympus OM-D EM-5 being the last).  Advanced point and shoots like Sony RX100.  I've had them all.  Sony Nex through Nex 7.  The only one I have not used yet is Sony A7/A7r.  But there are not enough lenses out for me to try the A7r.As for Fuji X,  I've owned X100, X100s, XA1, XE1 and now XE2 as my mirrorless camera of choice.  I am going to go through the negatives (for me) first and then the positives.Negatives1) I have a 20-month-old child at home.  That toddler (many that know him agree) is one of the most energetic children you'd ever encounter.  He runs non-stop all the time in unpredictable patterns.  His head moves too in every direction non-stop.  He never stops.  Well, he stops twice a day: for his nap, and at night to sleep.  That is it.  The AF of XE2, as well as AF of every other mirrorless camera I've owned (included the very fast AF of Olympus Om-D EM5) is mostly inadequate to consistently freeze him.  Those who have dealt with running toddlers know what I am talking about.  While the Af on mirrorless advances all the time, the truth is, even on the best mirrorless, with phase detection on sensor, it is still not like DSLR.  With top DSLRs like Canon 5D MARK 3 with Canon 70-200 F/2.8L IS II, I was generally able to freeze my son with no problems.  Same with my Nikon D800.  With any mirrorless, it is hit and miss.  With Fuji X, it is mostly miss.Anything else other than my son, Fuji XE2 does easily.  For my son,  DSLR with top of the line AF system is still the only game in town.2) Negative 2.  Flash system is a weak spot of Fuji system.  And for some reason Fuji keeps coming up with new cameras several times a year but do not address the issues.  Flash X-sync is only 1/180.  And on the new just announced XT1, it has not changed - still 1/180.  And Fuji does not allow to override Flash Xsync with external flash, there is nothing similar to ESS (canon) or FP (nikon) so you are stuck with 1/180.  On some type of shooting you can try 1/250 and you might have to crop the corner.  In any case,  many m43 models had 1/320 since 2013 and allow high speed Flash Xsync with their flashes.  And Fuji's only serious flash is a rebadged Sunpack.  Couple it with 1/4000 Maximum shutter speed (again many latest m43 models have had 1/8000 since 2013).  Again the newly announced XTI - only 1/4000 again.3) Negative 3.  Lack of lenses in the focal length that I need.  I shoot a lot of portraits and my wife's preferred focal length for portraits is 135mm.  There is nothing to address that focal length for portraits in Fuji's lineup, and there is nothing on their roadmap for that.  Canon has 135L.  Olympus has 75/1.8.  Fuji addressed 85mm equivalent (current 60/2.4, 56/1.2) which is great for full body shots, but for headshots, there is nothing (I don't take 55-200 in the account).  The only choice is a 50-140/2.8 zoom that might come out in about a year.  But I don't want a large and bulky and expensive zoom.  I love about Fuji is the terrific and compact primes that they have.  Again, this might not be important to you as you don't shoot in that specific focal length.  I do4) Negative 4.  Inability to assign Face Recognition on/off to Fn button at a top - this is unexplainable, Fuji.  This function IS available in cheaper and earlier released XM1 and XA1, yet not in later and more advanced XE2?  I contacted the Fujiguys about this issue and they promised to tell Fuji engineers.  I believe it is an easy fix in a firmware.  What was Fuji logic here it is not clear.  Instead to turn off the Face Recognition, one needs to dig in the menus each time.  And turning on Face Recogntion turns off several things  (like metering for example).  Fix it, Fuji.Now Positives:1) Image quality is unreal and it is unreal in Jpegs.  I agree with dpreview review that there is little need to shoot in RAW on Fuji X, Jpegs are that good.  Not only are Jpegs amazing on Fuji X, they are so good, that you have tons of room in highlights and shadows for recovery in JPEG!  I don't know how Fuji does it, but they do.  You've heard it, the room for highlight and shadow recovery in JPEG, not RAW!.  So Fuji X is the only camera I own that I shoot JPEGS only.  I shoot Raw on every one of my camera, from Nikon D800, to Olympus m43.  Fuji X - Jpegs.  So you get these compact files that are easy to work with and they preserve plenty.2) the low light capability is unreal for a crop sensor. Up to ISO6400 usable with flying colors and i am a pixel peeper.  I limit my Olympus to ISO1600, for comparison.3) the ergonomics, in terms of shutter speed wheel, aperture on lenses, focus switch in front and Q button,  you can adjust things on the fly so quickly, this is the quickest system to change parameters I've ever owned.  Very good.  Size is just right and I use lensmate thumb grip and Fuji leather half-case, and the result is quite comfortable to handhold.4) the little flash that can be bounced is very smart.  Thank you for keeping it.  The other way like Olympus OMD EM5 is pain because you always forget this separate little flash and end up losing it.  And it cannot bounce.  Unfortunately Fuji XTi went the Olympus route and removed the flash.  Why?  You want to show that your camera is professional and you don't need a build-in flash?  Tell to to Nikon D700 and D800 that has it.  It helps especially to fill in flash.-----The bottom line is for Image Quality Fuji XE2 is hard to beat.  it is also very addictive to use.Here is my wish list for XE31)  Increase the Xsync speed for flash!!!!!!  1/320 or at least 1/250 and ability to use High Speed Flash, without having to go through triggers etc.2) Shutter speed of 1/8000 please.  If it is impossible, how about a build-in ND fliter like on X100 or X100s?3) Tilt Display4) Work on faser AF5) Sd card on the side, not in the bottom with battery", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Magnificent all-around camera", "Author": "J. Gitzlaff", "ReviewID": "R3PLQNPJ6GPU0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my favorite camera, bar none: a joy to use.  Over the past two years I've had the opportunity to own and use various SLRs made by Fujifilm (the Fujifilm X-E1), Canon (the Canon EOS 5D Mark II), Sony (the Sony Alpha SLT-A65VL DSLR) and Sony NEX-5N, and of course a few compacts and various earlier models from years ago.  With that background out of the way, the X-E2 is my favorite all-around camera, with excellent image quality and surprising ease of use.  Its minor flaws may be an issue for some, but they seldom affect my real-world experience with it.Image Quality:  In a word, fabulous.  Amazing dynamic range that preserves shadow detail without blowing out highlights, this camera almost obviates any need for me to shoot layered exposures for HDR processing; I seldom use Photomatix Pro 4 at all anymore.  Sharp, detailed, and great color.  That makes the X-E2 an under-appreciated camera for landscape photography.  In my experience, the IQ from the X-E2 is roughly the same as its immediate predecessor the X-E1, but more surprisingly, the image quality of the X-E2 and X-E1 both are roughly on par with the pro-grade 5D mk II.  That's really good.Low Light:  When you combine the excellent sensor and onboard image processor of the X-E2 with its fairly broad selection of fast (f/2.8 or less) lenses, you quickly will get used to shooting handheld shots without a flash.  Consequently, this camera is a delight for use at parties, dinners, restaurants and of course street photography.  This camera also can handle extreme low light with relative ease.  For example, I took a lovely photo of the Milky Way and three shooting stars last summer at Tunnel View over the Yosemite Valley using a manual fisheye lens on my X-E1 using a 20 second exposure at 3600 ISO on an 8-inch mini-tripod. I never would have guessed that kind of shot would be possible, but the performance of the newer X-E2 is similarly strong.Handling: Solid and well-built.  Plenty of manual buttons and dials that allow you to make speedy, intuitive changes to settings (a dramatic contrast with the NEX series, which takes good enough photos on auto mode but are a total pain when you are forced to burrow into software menus to change most shot settings).  A solid weighty body with no flexing or creaking. By no means a 'compact' camera, yet substantially smaller than my 5D mk II, which felt like I was carrying around a lunchbox full of bricks by comparison.Performance:  Honestly, despite improvements auto-focus speed in low light remains a bit erratic.  Sometimes it's BANG on target, other times - again, mainly in low light, low-contrast situations - it seeks and seeks and the shot disappears before you can take it.  On the whole, I find AF on the X-E2 to be similar to or slightly faster than on the X-E1 and NEX series, but there is no denying that this is one area where it doesn't compare with some other models.  If you mostly frame shots at normal speed (cooperative subjects, landscapes) you'll never notice it, but if fast action is your main thing (sports) then this camera might not be your best choice.Accessories: Note that this camera is ALMOST the same dimensions as the X-E1.  I have a leather half-case that I bought for the X-E1, and it fits the dimensions of my X-E2 just fine.  However, the button configuration on the back face changed just enough that some of the buttons are crowding the edge of the leather case.  Still usable, but a little less convenient.

It has truly revived my enjoyment in photography.  To cut to the issues that a person considering purchasing this camera, I have included a list of the benefits and shortcomings of this camera below.Benefits:+  I have purchased all of the lenses except for the 18mm prime lens and every lens performs great!  You can use them wide open and still get very good results in the corners and the bokeh is exceptionally smooth!  Also, I feel that they chose the perfect lenses to start with so that you can shoot in almost any situation.+  The focus speed and accuracy, even in low light, is very good with this camera.  I am not going to lie and say it is as fast as Nikon's 70-200mm lens but these lenses also cost about a third as much.+  The camera and the lenses are so much lighter and compact than any 35mm set which makes hiking and just walking around with the camera so much more enjoyable!+  The sensor gives extremely shop results.  If you blow the image up to 100% and compare it's clarity to any 35mm camera you will notice a big difference.  I have made some very large blown-up prints (over 3ft) and they look very sharp!+  The color is amazing!  I feel that I have reduced the time that I have put into post shooting computer editing by more than half what I always used to have to do with my Nikons.  A much higher percentage of the .jpg images that I got straight from the camera I have been very pleased with than I have every experienced before.+  How it is set up makes using it extremely easy!  They have set up the buttons perfect for use in all ways except for one detail that is frustrating.  On the previous versions they had a view mode button which I used all the time!  You now have to go through the menu to find that which does take extra time.  Outside of that, every setting that you use the most is situated such that it is extremely easy to adjust in limited time and they did even include separate AF lock and AE lock buttons which are situated very close to each other which makes it perfect for use because I have a very large number of shots where I want to freeze one or the other or both.+  The camera saves the results to the SD card very quickly minimizing the situations of the camera stalling when shooting.+  There are options for doing manual focus which allows you to zoom into what ever part of the image you want to focus to and that is very nice!  It also has an option which shows you were you are in-focus in the image which is also very useful.+  There are film simulation settings that you can use when shooting .jpg images which are really slick and does give the image a very \"film like\" look.+  This camera performs extremely well at high ISO's.  I have many shots at 3200 which look fantastic!  I have shot as high as 6400 and still get results which are usable.+  Everything on the camera and lenses are extremely well made.  The focus and aperature are extremely smooth!+  The flash on the camera and face detection system both work very well.  I have usually not used the automatic procedures for either of these options in prior cameras just because of frustrating results but I am starting to use this much more often with this camera.-  There have been situations, especially shots in snow, where the images come out fairly cold in the white balance.  If you are shooting in raw it is very easy to alter.-  I would like to have it automatically write to two SD cards just to make sure no images are lost because of card issues.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Focusing and viewfinders issues mar an otherwise great image quality camera.", "Author": "But I'm feeling much better now...", "ReviewID": "R2X3P5XHJBFDE4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "*** Updated 4/4/2014 - I found myself using this camera less and less as time wore on.  I've relegated to using it as a second body to carry around with a Nikon adapter to use my Nikon lenses with my \"real\" cameras.  I had thought that  my experience was unique, but it has been pretty well proven by a lot of people, this camera just doesn't focus fast enough to use as anything other than a landscape or portrait camera.  My focusing method became one of half-pressing the shutter then counting one-mississippi two-mississippi three mississippi then completing the shutter press.  Before learning to do this I took it to a party in a fairly dark room along with a Nikon F100 film camera and switched lenses during the evening, about 90% of the shots from this camera are out of focus, and about 90% from the F100 are in focus.  To top it off, it looks like this camera has been abandoned by Fuji in favor of the X-T1 with superior focusing and wi-fi apps, if you must buy a Fuji get one of those, I loaned this to a friend for a couple of weeks, he compared it to an X-T1 and ended up getting that with no hesitation. Minus 2 stars, and if the sensor wasn't so good it would only get 1.****** Updated 1/5/2014  -  After updating the firmware with the latest version the focusing is much improved.  Another trip walking around city streets, a very dark performance art exhibit and to the ice skating rink yielded pretty good results.  I wish Fujifilm would have mentioned the focusing enhancements in their description of the update, all it says is that file naming was changed.  I upped my rating to 4 stars accordingly, but it really is probably 3.6 or so.  For one thing, the face detection bounces all or the place with groups of moving people, it won't find a face and lock on it.  (It looks like you're playing a video game with a quick targeting system) and for another there is a noticeable lag for focus lock and from pressing the shutter button to the camera actually firing the shutter.  I know I shot a lot of people in the air for example, and none of my results show them.  Some of my compositions are also off, with people that were in the viewfinder when I pressed the button only partly in the results. The focusing is much better than your average point and shoot, but still not up to dSLR standards.  ***So far I've gone on five different photo outings, plus just tried things around the house, and I've taken about 1200 photos.  Inside, outside, dim light, bright light, moving subjects, static subjects, I really mixed it up.  I downloaded and read the manual before I received the camera so I was able to get up and running quickly.For the size of this camera, the mage quality is outstanding in almost all conditions.  Nice colors, decent dynamic range, and low noise even at moderately high ISO's.  The matching of the new XF lens series really combines to make great images.  The photos are certainly better than any point and shoot I've shot with and even as good or even better than my Nikon D300 dSLR, which has the same size sensor but is about 5 years old.  I'd say realistically they are even as good as my Nikon D700, which has a full frame sensor and is 3 years old.  The only really issues I have with this camera is getting the image on the sensor in the first place, which I've detailed below.In no particular order, here are my thoughts and observations on the camera, with some personal views following.Battery:  I was out for about 4 hours in 20 degree weather, took 392 photos, and the battery indicator still showed I had a full battery.  It took about 1-1/2 hours to recharge the battery after that.  On another day I was out for about 5 hours and took about 450 photos before getting a battery warning.  Certainly not as bad as I was led to believe, but then I hardly use the monitor at all.Memory Card/File Sizes:  I was using a Fujifilm SD card and was shocked at how long it took to clear the camera's buffer.  I was shooting 3 shot HDR bursts in RAW and JPEG and counting in my head, it was a good 12 seconds to save the files, during which time the camera is inoperable.  I was missing shots and blaming the camera.  When that card got full, I switched to a Sandisk Extreme Pro 32GB card, and the writing time went down to about 3 seconds.  Shooting in continuous, I could get off about 7 RAW frames with no delay, and from that point on about 1 frame per second.  You can really only get quick continuous mode when shooting JPEG.  I tried an Eye-Fi Pro X2 card and it works fine, a good thing as the PC Autosave program will not run at all, at least on my Mac with OSX Mavericks.  You're really need to stock up on memory cards (and get a big hard drive as well), the RAW files are huge coming in at 33.4MB because there are no compression options available.  My 36MP Nikon D800E's RAW files in comparison are usually between 35-40 MB using the lossless compressed option.Flash:  Don't expect to be using the built in flash for much.  It is anemic.  I didn't look up the Guide Number, but I tried it inside and outside shooting people and it doesn't help much.  Shooting closeups of objects (I hesitate to call them macros) with the kit lens results in a shadow of the lens in the shot with or without the lens shade.  I also had a bunch of outdoor scenes ruined because of the shadow.  The good news is that Fujifilm has a number of flash options available and since it is a standard hot shoe I tried a cheap high powered flash on the hot shoe, a Yongnuo RF-460 and it works fine, although I had to set the flash power manually.Kit Lens:  The kit 18-55 lens is quite nice, not just a cheap beginners lens like I received with a Nikon.  It feels very solid, made of metal from what I can feel, and has an aperture ring for those of us that miss those.  The colors are nice, the contrast is nice, and I couldn't see any distortion when doing some architecture shots.  It is relatively fast with an aperture of f/2.8 to f/4. It took a bit of time to get used to seeing all of the lens settings in the viewfinder instead of on the lens, but this is really a better way of doing it.  The only issue I have with it is the small focusing ring for using manual focus, the zoom ring could be a bit smaller and the focus ring bigger.  If I had to choose one lens to start off with, this would be it.Lenses:  Fujifilm lenses for this camera are not cheap.  Unlike Nikon or Canon product lines (and a lot of 3rd party lenses available) in a wide variety of price points, you're pretty much stuck with buying lenses that seem to hover between the $600 to $900 price points.  Of course, if you don't care about losing the built-in correction features of the lenses, and autofocus, you can always get an adapter and use a lot of different brands of lenses.  I purchased an adapter to use my old Minolta MD mount lenses, so I have a full range of lenses off the bat.  I'm also ordering a Nikon adapter so I can use my Nikon Pro lenses if I really want to.  I doubt I'll be investing in the full range of Fujifilm XF lenses, I don't really need a whole new third system and the lenses could not be used on any other of my cameras.  One thing about buying Nikon or Canon lenses, you're pretty much assured you'll be able to use them on newer camera bodies well into the future, but with Fujifilm (or Panasonic or Sony, etc. for that matter) it's a much bigger gamble of what you're going to do with the lenses if the manufacturer decides to pull out of the camera market.ISO: I found my photos usable at least to ISO 6400, I was really surprised.  By usable above 1600 or so I of course mean printing small or using on the web, I wouldn't be making any huge prints from these.  Lower ISO's are stunning, no doubt about it, no visible noise at all.  I checked using the in-camera setting, Lightroom, and Nik/Google's Define with Photoshop CC.  The in-camera noise reduction is really aggressive, and a lot of detail is lost at higher ISO's.  What I found a bit strange is that 12,800 and 25,600 ISO's are blocked when shooting RAW for some reason.  While the in-camera processing does a decent job at these speeds, and I would use them if I absolutely had to, I wouldn't want to be switching to JPEG at an event to use them as it would really screw up my post processing workflow.  This one is a head scratcher.Focusing:  Probably the weakest area of the camera.  Most people are probably used to just aiming the camera in the general area of their subject and having the camera pick the focus point.  This camera will not do that.  You get a single focus point.  Your choices are to move that focus point around the screen to match where your subject is or keeping the focus point fixed and moving your camera to put your subject under the focus point and then recomposing the scene.  This makes it very difficult to focus on moving subjects, and combined with the stuttering and lagging of the viewfinder makes it almost impossible.  I tried three times to photograph ice skaters moving at a leisurely pace and was for the most part unsuccessful, and I haven't had such a poor success rate shooting them in a long time.  Out of the 350 frames I shot of ice skaters I doubt that 20 are in focus.  I wouldn't want to even try kids running around inside the house.  Even with the focus area being confined to one small spot, the focus is not as snappy as the specs would have you believe.  In normal room light when switching from a close to distant subject it appears to focus quickly with what is probably the phase detection, but it takes a good second to achieve really sharp focus, which is probably when the contrast detection focus settles down.  Probably not a problem if you're shooting a house plant, but again, pretty unusable for anything moving.  The face detection turned out to not work very well except for faces taking up a large part of the frame and standing still.  It would not find a face at all with people on the ice rink or walking by on a sidewalk.Electronic Viewfinder: This may be the best EVF available for mirror less cameras according to Fujifilm, but it leaves me wanting.  It just does not equal the quality of a camera with a mirror reflecting the scene into your eye.  Moving objects lag to the point that you really can't see what you're shooting.  The lag time is awful.  I was shooting some ice skaters in continuous mode while panning, and even though I kept the skater in the frame the resulting photos have the skaters gradually moving off of the frame to the point where I have half the skater.  The resolution does not match that of an optical viewfinder, small details are hard to see.  When shooting some snow scenes for example, I could not see the texture of the snow in the foreground, something that I usually depend on to ensure I have the foreground sharp.  The dynamic range of the viewfinder does not match what is really in the scene, so you really don't know if you might be missing something important. \"Blooming\" is also an issue as the exposure settles down, or at least tries to,  I found it amusing that street lamps flicker like oil burning lamps in the viewfinder.Controls:  Controlling the camera has been a challenge for me.  Being used to big buttons and dials spaced pretty far apart it has taken me a bit of effort to use small buttons and dials placed close together.  Holding the camera as I normally hold one, none of the controls really are under my thumb, as a matter of fact my thumb feels best when it is half way across the camera.  The exposure compensation dial is really hard to turn, which I guess is in response to the complaints of the loose control on the X-E1.  What would have really helped here is a rubberized coating on it.  When shooting full manual, it gets pretty tough to change the shutter speed on the fly with the dial on top of the camera.  It may look cool there but I have to arch my hand to get at it.Manual:  The manual is pretty much like most camera manuals, a lot of \"Put switch A in position B to enable function C (not available with modes D,E,or F).\", with little explanation of anything.  There is no index, so make sure to download a PDF so you can use the `Find' command.  There is also a lot of helpful information on forums such as dpreview.Software:  The included software to render RAW images seems to do a decent job.  However, it is totally backwards from anything else I've ever used.  I just went to Adobe Lightroom after trying to learn how to use the software using the HTML link help pages/manual.  I did get a couple of images out and they look good, but the software is really not something I want to spend time learning really well, everything is just weird.  I'm not sure if the wireless PC tethering software works or not, it seems to but I can't get the camera to connect through my network.  I should note that as of the time of this review, there are no profiles for this camera or lenses in Adobe Lightroom or Camera RAW, something that I miss.  The IOS App works ok, but is not anything like what you might find for your GoPro Hero, for example, you cannot control your camera from it.  I did have a good reason to use it the other day, I grabbed a newsworthy image off the camera and uploaded it to the internet, so some people might find that useful.Shooting Mirrorless:  On the bright side unlike with a DSLR what you see is what you get.  This is a great advantage for anybody that really does not want to learn all about exposure. There are no surprises when you get home, load your photos on your computer, and find that all of your photos have screwed up exposures.  The ability to preview depth of field is fantastic.  I have to admit I rarely do this with my DSLR's as usually when you step down the lens to check DOF everything is too dark to see.  However, the lack of a mirror also results in some downsides, primarily being the speed of focusing and seeing your scene exactly as it appears especially with moving subjects.  The absence of a mirror also allows for the use of a variety of lenses because there is no fear of the lens intruding into the mirror box.Size and weight:  I almost always have a real camera with me.  (By real I mean not a camera phone.)  What I've been throwing into my backpack every day is a Nikon D300 with a Sigma 28-300 lens, which I guess could be considered a professional camera by some and a semi-professional camera by others.  The Fujifilm weighs about 1-1/2 pounds with the kit lens.  The D300 weighs about 3-1/3 pounds with the Sigma lens.  The X-E2 measures about 5.5W by 5.5L by 3H and the D300 measures about 6W by 7L by 4.5H.  In real terms the X-E2 is about 2 pounds lighter and 1.5 inches smaller in height than the D300.  I don't have access to any smaller cameras to compare to, I believe the Nikon D5200 or D7100 are much smaller and lighter than the D300, and would probably be a better comparison.  However, the question for me becomes which camera do I carry around every day since getting the X-E2.  For my needs it will be the D300.  I'm a Getty Contributor and have also been published several hundred times in a local web news page, and a lot of my published images are of newsworthy events that I don't think I would have caught with the X-E2.  The focusing and the controls are just not appropriate for quick responses by me to fluid situations.  On the other end, I now use a D800E for fine art and architectural images and a D700 for events (not weddings).  The X-E2 will not replace either of those cameras for a lot of reasons.I had tried previously to use a point and shoot as a walk around camera, a Leica D-LUX-4.  It has mostly sat in a drawer since the novelty of having a new camera wore off.  The lack of a decent zoom range, noise even at low ISO's (maybe 400 to 800 as the max), and the lack of a viewfinder just killed it as a go to camera..  The X-E2 is far superior to the D-LUX-4 in those regards, though it is not coat pocketable like the Leica.  I've also had two other P&S;'s that just didn't work out.  I've also been trying out a GoPro Hero3+ Black I bought for quadcopter use as a walk around camera, but it pretty much proves smaller and lighter is not always better.There are a couple of situations where I wouldn't hesitate to take the X-E2 out with me over a DSLR.  For one thing, I noticed that people ignore me with the camera unlike having a huge DSLR.  Guards in a couple places didn't even give me a second glance when I've had problems before with them trying to kick me out.  People on the street don't seem to be as intimidated, making it much easier to get candid street shots.  Here is the biggest thing about size:  after receiving the Fotodiox Minolta MD converter, I've discovered that I can pack the X-E2, a Minolta 50mm f/1.4 a Vivatar 28mm f/2.8, a Vivitar 75-205 f/3.5-4.5, a 2X teleconverter, and the kit 18-55 all in one National Geographic Small Shoulder Bag with a total weight of about 6 pounds.  Add a Benro Travel Angel tripod and I'm still well under 10 pounds with accessories.  To duplicate that setup with my biggest DSLR and pro lenses requires a giant backpack, a heavy tripod, probably coming in at about 30-35 pounds.  The question becomes which to carry.  If I'd want to shoot more things I'd grab the X-E2, if I'd want to shoot with better quality I'd grab a DSLR, the shots are just better.  If I needed to look like a professional on a shoot, I'd definitely grab the DSLR.  If I needed to be able to shoot in under other than optimum conditions I'd grab a DSLR.  If I just wanted to go out and fool around I'd grab the X-E2.  I was out for about 6 hours one day, all over the city.  Walked about 4 miles along with a lot of train and bus trips. (Nice being able to just hide this camera under my coat instead of putting it away!)  Yes, I was probably less tired than carrying around my DSLR and a couple of lenses all day.  However, when combing through the 450 or so images I took I was kind of disappointed, a lot were no good due to focusing issues, a lot were just not quite right timing wise, and a lot just look like snapshots.  There are around 20 or so I would submit for publication (one was published the same day) and really nothing that I'd put up for sale as a print.  I might have been tired after carrying around a lot yesterday, but I'd be over that the next day and forget about it and at least have memorable images.Will I be replacing my professional dSLR's with this? No.  Would I buy this instead of an entry point dSLR? No, the dSLR is cheaper to start out with and easier to use for shots of kids around the house, sports, etc.  Would I buy this instead of an intermediate dSLR?  Maybe.  That would depend on whether I already owned a lot of lenses, or if I was worried about size and weight, or the speed and accuracy of focusing.  Would I buy this instead of a point and shoot?  Yes, but again price might be an issue for many.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Superb!

Even the smallest DSLR is twice the depth and weight of the Fuji body.  The APC Fuji sensor is fantastic and provides the same effective field of view and depth of field at a given focal length as any comparable DSLR.You can read about specs and peek at pixels  all day.  The bottom line is the best camera is the one you have with you when you need to take a photo.  An 8x10 large format camera with an 800 megapixel scanning back will give you better image quality than this or any so-called \"full-frame\" DSLR.  Good luck walking around with either that 8x10 camera or that bulky DSLR all day.Fuji has hit the sweet spot of brilliant image quality in a body + lens package that is light and small enough to carry all day without a second thought.The only detractors for this body are its lack of weather sealing and an optical view finder.  Weather sealing (especially at this price point) should have been provided.  Because the whole point of a carry everywhere camera is that you can carry it everywhere regardless of weather.  As far as the EVF (electronic view finder) versus OVF (optical view finder) argument goes, you have to decide for your self.  I owned the Fuji X-Pro1 that has an OVF but found the camera body too big and the EVF was horribly slow and grainy.  The EVF on the X-E2 is worlds beyond the X-Pro1 or any other EVF I have ever used.  The EVF is smooth and bright.  But it is not an optical finder.  There is still some lag in the display and in extreme bright daylight the EVF is near impossible to see until I have cupped my hand over my viewing eye and let my eye adjust to the light differential for several seconds.  Big deal?  Well, it can be.  Those few seconds are the difference between getting the shot and not in many candid situations.The EVF is better the an optical non-TTL view finder because for macro work you HAVE TO USE THE EVF!  I like macro shooting and even the X-Pro1 switches to its EVF when in macro mode.  The EVF also can give an amazing real time display of exposure which is a revelation coming from a purely optical SLR system.I still give this 4/5 stars as I find it infinitely usable and a real pleasure to shoot with.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera for just about all my photographic needs", "Author": "Vincent W King", "ReviewID": "R94CWLJZ46QGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Need to learn how to use focus assist.

It can also let you leave your heavy dSLR at home when you travel. This review is based on over eight weeks of almost daily X-E2 use, with lenses from 15mm to 135mm.1. You need an M-mount adapter to use any Leica M lens on the X-E2. I use Fuji's M-mount adapter.2. You'll be manually focusing any of these lenses. The X-E2 provides two manual focus assist methods. Focus peaking shows glowing highlight edges on in-focus areas. Digital split image shows blurry offset pieces of your subject which merge to one when you're in focus. Either mode's accuracy improves when you magnify the finder view 3X or 10X.3. Manual focusing works best at a lens' widest aperture. Wide-open, you get the shallowest possible depth of field for the best visual indication of sharp focus. Accurate focusing can be difficult with f/2.8 and f/4 lenses that are shorter than 28mm on the X-E2. An optical rangefinder will always be more accurate focusing 15mm-28mm lenses.4. M-lenses wider than 35mm may show problems in the corners - vignetting (darkening), color tints, or focus-smearing for some, especially for non-Leica lenses.5. The EVF and LCD both have limited contrast range. White areas may appear to be blown out in the finder, but images show detail in those areas when downloaded to Lightroom. The only way to check this in the camera is to look at the histogram for blown highlights.6. You may find yourself hunting through the X-E2's deeply-nested menus to change camera settings such as enabling the histogram in the viewfinder, until you discover some settings are slightly less nested in the Q-menu. That Q-menu button wouldn't be needed with a smaller set of camera functions. It's an acknowledgement that there are too many choices.7. Fuji's 16MP X-Trans sensor is capable of fine resolution. However, its RAF raw file format isn't handled well by Lightroom 5.3, and Lightroom 5.4 gives only slightly better results. DNG raw images from the M8's unfiltered 10MP sensor can appear sharper than those from the X-E2. These issues made me want to very accurately focus the X-E2, and hold it very steady for the sharpest images.8. CR2 raw images from Canon's 20MP EOS 5D mk II appear sharper than those from either the X-E2 or the M8 in Lightroom 5.4. However, the 5D mk II is a boat anchor with any EF L-series lens attached.Beyond those limitations, the X-E2 provides you with a real shutter speed dial and instant access to exposure compensation. Well-focused pictures can match the resolution of those taken with a Leica M8, and show accurate auto white balance, compared to the M8's overly-blue AWB. The X-E2 also provides almost noise-free images above ISO 640, unlike the M8. And like any recent dSLR, the X-E2 has ultrasonic sensor cleaning, which Leica M-cameras lack.So it's horses for courses.If you need critical rendition of expansive landscapes with fine details, or of architecture with straight verticals using tilt-shift lenses, or shoot fast-moving sports or wildlife in sketchy conditions, use a dSLR.If you want to travel light with the versatility of interchangeable lenses (adventure travel), use the X-E2 or a Leica M. The Leica M is better for photojournalism or street photography with lenses between 25mm and 90mm, with its simple, uncluttered viewfinder.  The Leica M is also faster-acting - it has shorter turn-on time, its viewfinder is always on, and there's just a single level of limited menu choices. The M is better when you need critical wide-angle focusing.  Of course, the M is also much more expen$ive.On balance, the X-E2 will likely replace your other cameras for 80% of your photography, but you'll need your dSLR for a few critical situations. A rangefinder camera makes a great companion alongside the X-E2, and both together weigh less than a comparable dSLR outfit.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "An Absolutely Outstanding Camera !

This is an opinion, not a fact.  It represents the view of one individual, a view to which he is entitled.  However it is incorrect as you can readily see at: [...]  * I just realized Amazon doesn't allow links. So please go to 500px.com, click on photos at the top of the page, then search for \"Fuji X-e2 kids.\"which features the excellent work of Gerald Gay.  Note in particular his shot titled \"Boat Raiders\" which caught an exuberant youth in mid air!  And Gerald took these tack sharp photos with an X-E1 which is equipped with a slower focus system than what is built into the X-E2.  Moreover, some of the classic \"action shots\" predate digital photography by decades.  The famous one by Henri Cartier-Bresson of the man leaping over a puddle was shot with an early Leica film camera which didn't even have a rangefinder much less autofocus!  In short, action photography requires considerable skill on the part of the photographer.  It is unfair to blame your equipment when it's equally likely it's  the person behind the camera who needs to improve.  'Nuff said.More positively the X-E2 is capable of capturing color in a way that is superior to anything I've seen coming out of very, very expensive DSLRs.  Granted this is my opinion but I can say I studied hundreds of Fuji X series images before buying my X-e2. I've heard folks describe Fuji color rendition as \"painterly,\" \"water colors,\" or \"subtle.\" I've give you a hypothetical. If in a given scene your typical Nikon/Canon renders the yellows in a great sunset shot into 10 discreet shades, the Fuji X-E2 would differentiate between 50 shades of yellow.  It's ability to make very, very, very refined distinctions between tones is jaw dropping.  And this capacity carries over into the realm of B&W; where the results it produces, right out of camera, are nearly indistinguishable from film....really good film.High ISO is becoming a relative term as the technology improves nearly daily.  I've been shooting indoors at mainly ISO 1600 and I rarely find the need to reduce the noise in camera or in PP because there is hardly anything to reduce.  And that's coming from someone who is decidedly suffering from OCD. :)I will give the critics their due on the battery business.  Fuji needs to improve battery life for this gem of a camera.  Until then, buy a spare, but be sure it's a Fuji battery.  Some of the knock off products are the pits.  See Amazon reviews on this.point.In summary, this camera will make you \"work\" a little but that \"work\" isn't going to make you sweat unless you perspire easily.  Another way to put it is that your X-E2 will inspire you to think about what you are doing.  And for those \"doesn't do action well\" critics, you'll just have to think about your shots in advance.  Just like the famous Henri Cartier-Bresson did.  Now please, go buy yourself an X-E2 with at least the \"kit\" 18-55mm lens.  It's a sacrilege to call that built-like-a-tank, sharp as a razor lens a \"kit lens.\"  To borrow from Mark Twain: Kit lenses are like lightning bugs, the Fuji kit lens is the lightning !I hope you'll enjoy your X-E2.

I finally tried Fujifilm X-E2 and I am glad that I tried it now since ILC cameras has improved a lot and is starting to create a really good case against DSLRs for many use cases.

And If you travel often, I would recommend you to also buy a pancake lens for this camera (e.g. Fujifilm XF 27mm F/2.8) which will make this camera even more portable and you can carry it in your jacket pocket.What I like with Fujifilm X-E2:- Great image quality- Compact and solidlly build- Fast auto-focus for ILC standard- Bright and crisp LCD and viewfinder- Lots of individual dial which is handy (aperture, exposure compensation, etc)- Retro look (and less intimidating)What I miss from DSLR:- Speed (almost no shutter lag and fast auto-focus, basically from camera off to taking pictures can be very fast)- The shutter sound (the Fujifilm X-E2 can simulate the shutter sound digitally but it just doesn't feel the same)- Better battery life and more lens options- Looking like a professional photographer :)Bottom line: Fujifilm X-E2 is a great substitute for DSLR unless you are shooting sports then you might want to stick with your DSLR and fast zoom lens (e.g. 70-200mm F/2.8 lens).Sidarta Tanu", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "A quirky, yet fun camera to shoot with and a terrific zoom lens", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R14ELAWRX49E96", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm X-E2 is just the third compact system camera I've spent time shooting with and have really enjoyed it.  I previously used a Sony NEX-5N and NEX-5T, but rarely shot with either of them.  I mainly rely on my Canon DSLR or my smartphone for most of my needs, which are relatively modest.  However, I'm always on the lookout for something better, so when I had the opportunity to try out the X-E2, I was very eager to see if it'd be the compact system camera that'd finally allow me to put my DSLR away.PROS:- Great image quality- Good autofocus performance- Very good 18-55mm bundled zoom lens- Good use of physical dials and buttons- Solid build quality- Built-in flash with bounce capability- Easy to grip and hold- Built-in EVFCONS:- Tripod mount is right next to the battery/SD card door- Wi-Fi software and apps need more polish- EVF eye sensor has difficulty in bright sunlightDESIGNI like the X-E2's retro appearance and think it's a nice, unique look.  The build quality is also impressive, which is what I'd expect from a camera in this price range.  The exposure and shutter speed dials have a solid feel to them, as do the buttons.  The connector cover (HDMI, USB, and remote/mic) and battery/SD card door feel nice and sturdy too.  Unfortunately, the battery/SD card door is right next to the tripod mount, which will make replacing the battery or memory card a hassle if you shoot a lot with a tripod.The layout of the dials and buttons work well and the large hand grip in the front makes the X-E2 comfortable to hold.  The X-E2 is a much larger compact system camera than I'm used to, having come from the NEX-5.  Still, the X-E2 feels good in my hands or attached to a strap/sling.The built-in flash is light on power, but works well in the right conditions.  I especially love the ability to bounce with it.  I'm looking forward to upgrading to one of the shoe mount flashes, however (EF-20 or EF-42).  The built-in EVF is the first EVF I've ever tried and it seems to work OK, but I did find it slightly awkward to use.  Since it's located all the way to the left, I can see objects outside the viewfinder, which I find distracting.  Also, when I took the X-E2 outdoors on a sunny day, the eye sensor had difficulty auto-switching to the EVF when I put my eye up against it.  This got rather annoying since I couldn't really use the LCD, which was hard to see in the bright sunlight.  To avoid this problem, I'd recommend going into the menu and switching the display to EVF-only when you know you'll be shooting in bright sunlight.PICTURE QUALITYI normally shoot in RAW for added flexibility, but admit that JPGs are very convenient.  Unfortunately for me, the editing tools I use don't support the X-E2's RAW files.  I tried the software tools that were included with the X-E2, but didn't particularly care for them.  The Silkypix RAW file converter worked OK, but I like Canon's Digital Photo Professional more, and even still, would prefer to use Lightroom.  I ended up switching to JPG and was very happy with the results on the X-E2 with the default film simulation (Provia/Standard).  Most of my shots came out sharp, with good color balance and contrast.  Using JPG was also necessary for when I wanted to send images to my Android phone using the X-E2's Wi-Fi feature, since Android doesn't support RAW files (yet).  The 18-55mm F2.8-4.0 zoom lens that comes bundled with the X-E2 is an outstanding lens and not your average \"kit\" lens.WI-FII've used Eye-Fi cards in the past to get wireless support on my cameras, but it got a bit tedious and the memory cards themselves didn't perform as well as normal high performance SD cards.  The X-E2's built-in Wi-Fi worked well with my Android phone, but the app itself isn't exactly what I'd call, robust.  Also, I wasn't able to try the PC autosave feature, because the software wouldn't install on my PC.  I plan to use the Wi-Fi feature a lot to share photos on Flickr and Instagram when I'm on-the-go.CONCLUSIONThe Fujifilm X-E2 is a great compact system camera.  It's highly customizable and includes a plethora of features, which can be intimidating at first, but rewarding if you spend the time to learn them.  I haven't had the chance to try out many different compact system cameras, but there's definitely enough there with the X-E2 to keep me interested and shooting with it.  Now begins the patient process of adding more lenses and a good flash to round out the experience, which is something I'm really looking forward to.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Delightful Camera", "Author": "Dwight Roberts", "ReviewID": "R2L86NI09IKAOG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has made me take it wherever I go! It really reminds me of the old rangefinder film days. The focusing isn't the fastest on the market but it is good. Fuji's lens map for 2014 is stellar as is the build quality and images I get from the basic 18-55 lens that it came with. I shoot weddings and portraits professionally and bought this camera to add to my bag for being discreet and light at receptions. The ONLY complaint I have about this system is the lack of flash options and the lack of a pc connection. I have to purchase a Wein Safe Sync to use it with my studio lights. This should be a standard function with any of their X bodies, but it isn't. I went into this purchase with eyes wide open and overall love this little gem. It makes me want to take photos for pleasure again, something my Canon hasn't done in years. I am researching some of the old lenses for their qualities and imperfections and the cost of the various adapters to use them! Image quality from this is fantastic with just the jpegs. I am used to shooting RAW but as of now, Apple hasn't come up with a RAW converter for Aperture, so I can't comment on RAW to JPEG quality as of yet. It comes with it's own Silky-somthingorother program, but I use Aperture for it's quality. I'll revisit this when Aperture is updated and I get a chance to go over some images. If you want a \"put it in auto\" camera, this is NOT for you, stick to the glorified point and shoot Canon/Nikon dslr's. This camera is designed like a rangefinder and has a shutter speed dial, aperture ring and exposure comp and is very \"stick and rudder\". Flash issues are the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.

Regarding taking photos, the most limiting capability of the camera is rapidity and accurately detecting and focusing faces.  The camera is unable to maintain continuous focus during video.5 Stars - Image quality, low-light performance, better than average kit lens.3 stars for value, pervasive focus issues, poor face detect, battery performance, very limited wi-fi feature, highly inconsistent continuous video focus which renders the video capability as non-existent, poor attention to finer design details for this price range.The camera has great potential with firmware updates which hopefully address some of the focus issues.To achieve sharp low-light shots, shoot in auto-iso and set max to 3200-6400, and minimum shutter speed 1/250.I mainly purchased this camera to document our 3 month old.  Deciding on investing in the X series was an exhaustive three week process of reading hundreds if not thousands of pages on the web, not just on the X-E2, but the upcoming Sony a6000 (and the Nex 6), the Nikon D7100, Canon 70D, the micro 4/3s options, and the Sony rx 100 ii.The problem with most of the review content on the Web, especially with camera hardware, is that the most visible reviews by search engines are by 'pros', whom eventually link directly to retail sites in order to amass their kickback income.  Because they have done all of his work for you, taking time away from their professional wedding schedule to review a free camera on loan which they likely have no intention of keeping, you should consider buying from their link to thank them for their humble tasting sweat.The marketing around this camera is focus, focus, focus.  This does not apply to face detect.  Fuji's face detection on the X-E2 is eons behind $150 point and shoot cameras by Canon.  Those same 'pros' I mentioned before will tell you face detection is a gimmick.This is another disconnect in how camera hardware gets parsed through peer review today.  The point of a small body large sensor camera is weight and profile.  Getting the moment at a birthday with this camera should be casual, effortless, and anonymous.  I'm not framing and setting focus points.  The X-E2 reacts to faces, at best, average if not worse.  It certainly disappoints.  \"But it is a classic looking rangefinder for street...\" it should be more, it is marketed as more, it is priced as more.  I'm not supposed to have to carry a point and shoot if I have a mirrorless camera, I don't care if it looks like a rangefinder, or maybe I am missing the point of mirrorless.The selectable focal points focus fast.Edit 3/30/14 // In the original review I lamented the ability to quickly select focal points and not being able to do so in auto focus modes.  In order to select focal points in auto modes, face detect must be disabled.As Keith Blodget points out: \"To select the focus point in auto or manual modes press the down button on the 4-way controller (labeled 'af') use the 4-way pad to move the focus point, spin the command wheel to increase or decrease the focal point size, press the center 'ok' button to accept your changes.\"  Thanks Keith//Most of the reviews are done using the faster primes.  The only lens I opted for up front was the kit, since if you don't purchase the 18-55 with the camera, Fuji wants $650.  It does have OIS which does beef up the cost.  At 35mm it is at f/3.6.Breakdown:Image Quality:  In the right conditions can really produce beautiful color and dynamic range.  Image quality is covered extensively here and elsewhere.IQ: The camera can spit out some pretty beautiful images in JPEG.  In low light, and sometimes in other more complex situations, it is almost like you can notice the amount of work the camera is doing to accomplish this.  At 1/1000 shutter, I have heard the camera sound as it was mechanically or virtually operating for a much slower exposure (the sound the camera makes is at least partially artificial).  This is complete conjecture, but it is as if the engineers are masking the processing time.Low Light Performance:  Very good to excellent for a APS-C.  You are not going capture a single face in a whole crowd in focus in low light without a flash with a sensor this size, I think people have that misconception.  In low light you will be using a flash for living subjects, and the built-in flash excels at providing just the right level of flash.  My experience is that this is especially the case at higher ISOs.  The camera works a little algorithmic magic with higher ISOs.  For B&W;, street, fun, 6400 is pretty impressive.  3200 is printable.  This is a 16MP sensor, the presumed practical output medium at 1600 will be relatively and comparatively excellent.  That said, I am very interested in how the a6000 is going to perform with its new 24MP sensor, how it will compare, and the detail and low light trade offs.Flash: Good IQ for level, but it does not extend high enough above the camera not to cast shadows from the 18-55 lens!  If there would be an X-E3, I am sure this would be fixed.  Also, would it have been that difficult for a $900 - $1000 body to have a built-in lens which could be articulated to use as a bounce?  Flash sync is 180 with a dedicated spot on the dial.  The camera supposedly has a \"daytime syncro\" for daylight fill but have not used it.  Not that I didn't have the opportunity, but nothing about the deeper functions of this camera are intuitive to access and the accompanying printed manual is atrocious.People focus: Face detect is pretty slow, and gets confused easily with multiple people.  Remember those fast focus marketing numbers, has nothing to do with face detect enabled.  Overall, I'd estimate I had about 50% success on getting sharp focus on faces.  At distance, in low light, the camera struggles with face detect.Video focus: 1 star.  Actually horrible in anything but good to great light.  Testing with a single subject, mostly fixed distance, the camera struggles in medium light, losing focus for seemingly no reason.  Essentially, consider this camera without a video feature.  Edit 3/30/14 // With over an hour of shooting video, manual is the only way to get any keepsake video out of the camera.  Face detect and the camera's ability to motion track are very poor. //Video Quality: Can really be awing if the camera manages to retain subject focus.  I purchased the X-E2 with video in mind as a primary function.  This is the state of cameras.  For anyone to tell you video on a camera is a secondary feature today is probably using a typewriter.  (Also no 24p)EVF: Sometimes doesn't react quickly enough and you are staring at darkness in the view finder.Batter: Worst-in-class, worst I have ever seen on a camera of any type and size.Features: Overall lacking for a $900 - $1000 body!!Wi-fi -  what a pointless and half hearted execution.  This was a really big disappointment.  The app (android also IOS avail) allows sharing photos to the phone.  There is absolutely no remote function, no remote view, or any other function for that matter of the app.Screen - Beautiful.  But not a touch screen.  And a touch to focus would have been nice.  Also does not articulate, which I did not realize how handy this would be until shooting the birthday recently.HDR - The camera lacks built-in HDR and only supports bracketing (3) in +-1 stops.  Again, to 'pros' this is a hokey feature and can be done post.  Whatever, it should be in the camera and I would have liked it there.No Dedicated Video Record button - This would of course go against the retro range-finder design I suppose.Panoramic - Works well.Printed Manual: Basic.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Another great Fuji ILC body, fast and responsive!", "Author": "Rob S.", "ReviewID": "R30N8FIWU5FZ19", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary: Another great Fuji ILC body, fast and responsive with terrific picture quality. -1 star for the missed opportunity on WiFi functionality.This review is from the perspective of someone who shot Nikon D70 -> D200 -> D300 for the better part of 10 years and sold off all of that SLR gear for prosumer convenience, picking up the Fuji X100 last year.  We've owned the X100, X-M1 and now the X-E2.The Good- Picture Quality: With our X100 and X-M1, we were shooting RAW+JPEG. With the X-E2, we've been shooting JPEG only and loving the results. The built-in film simulation filters (common to all X-bodies) are terrific, and we've even mapped the Fn button on the top to cycle between then we like using them so much. Saves a lot of post-processing time :)- Speed: The camera starts up quickly (ready for use in <= 2 seconds) and is fast and responsive during operation.  Autofocus is fast as well, much improved over the X100 (if you had that and were thinking of upgrading or sidegrading).- Menus: If you're already a Fuji camera user, the menus and functionality are indistinguishable from one another.  There's plenty of options and they're easy to navigate.The Needs Improvement- WiFi: Ideally this would work by joining your home network and synchronizing photos. Unfotunately as implemented, the WiFi feature is absurd. When activated on the camera, it creates a public network which you must join from your iPhone/iPad. From there you can transfer images to your device and then Apple handles the automatic syncing? This is reflected on the App Store, where the Fuji app is rated 2/5 stars on only 13 reviews. If this is in any way something important to you, know that it needs a lot of work and in its current form, useless (to me at least).Overall these compact ILC bodies are starting to look like very attractive alternatives to lugging around piles of SLR gear.

Basically, you get the best of both worlds.  The camera is relatively small, lightweight, and easy to handle... it would be a good camera to take on a vacation or a trip because it is very portable.  At the same time, you still get a high-quality image and access to many of the same creative options that you would have on a DSLR camera.The Fujifilm X-E2 is the first of this type of camera that I have owned, and I played around with it for over a month.  So far I am very impressed.  It takes some time to get used to the controls and discover all the features - but once you read the manual and practice taking pictures you'll see that the camera is designed for the customer's ease of use.Here are some of the features that I enjoy:- High-Quality 16.3 megapixel image.  My pictures have come out looking great, especially portraits and landscape shots.- Camera supports both Autofocus and Manual Focus.  I like to focus manually most of the time, but the autofocus on this camera is quite accurate (although not particularly fast in all cases).- Full manual control over ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed.  These settings are also fairly simple to change in a hurry.- Built-in filters, such as soft focus, high and low key, and partial colors.- Self-timer can be set to 2 or 10 seconds.- The camera supports \"Bulb\" function for long exposures.- This camera can do many specialty shots, such as Panoramics and Double Exposures- Continuous shooting in \"Burst\" mode yields up to 7 frames per second.  This is a nice feature for action shots.- There is a sensor that determines your proximity to the camera... So when taking a photo it automatically detects whether you want to look through the viewfinder or just use the live-view LCD screen.- It can record full HD movies.  The camera can continually auto-focus during a video shot, so your main subject is always in focus (this is a feature typically found only in the high-end DSLRs).One thing I do not like about this product is that they do not include a USB cable to transfer your pictures to another device.  You are supposed to connect the camera wirelessly to your laptop, etc to transfer your photos.  I don't care for this wireless option, and for $1000+ you'd think they could include the USB cable for those that want it.  This cable can be purchased separately, or you can simply remove the memory card from the camera and transfer the pictures via a card reader (under $20).Price is probably going to be a common issue for most people.  High-end compact system cameras are quite expensive, particularly if you wish to purchase additional lenses.  This set includes the basic 18-55mm lens, which is good for portraits and medium/wide shots -- but you're probably going to want to invest in a telephoto lens as well to capture subjects that are farther away (which can cost another $500).  If you are a beginner to photography or want a camera for common everyday use, there are cheaper Compact System Cameras and DSLRs (like the Canon T3i) that will do just fine.

I've primarily been a M43 user but have been drawn to the Fuji platform based on reviews and the hundreds of images I've research on Flickr and other photo sites. I love the depth, color, and film-like quality that Fuji renders. I've been able to replicate the Fuji look to some degree in Lightroom and Photoshop but really wanted the OOC experience. And to be honest, I also just wanted something new to obsess over. I enjoy learning how to use new tools. At this point I see the Fuji as a companion to the M43; an alternative pallet to work with. I purchased the Fuji 18mm f2 lens since it's closes to the prime lens I have most often on my Lumix GX7. At this point I'm not looking to make one platform or the other exclusive. After I've spent more time with the camera I'll try to post some comparisons.On a side note (which has nothing to do with the camera itself), I received a camera that was clearly pre-owned or used. The battery was already installed, the user prefs and clock have been set, and the LCD had fingerprints all over it. The file numbers were well above 200.

Fuji came a little late to the mirrorless party, and they got much right, but when I tried earlier examples, the autofocus was subpar and it just felt too slow for a $1000 setup.This addresses those concerns and gets just about everything right.  Some of the pros:Compact, but not overly so to diminish \"holdability\"Lens selection (already among the best for mirror less)Great \"kit\" lens (phenomenal build, better than average light gathering, and quality images)Built in flash that can be bounced (by holding it up)Speedy AF (no longer an issue)Excellent image qualityGreat high ISO performanceSolid intuitive controls (the menus do have quirks)and the cons:Not pocketable (not necessarily a con, but do know it's too big for most pockets, even with a \"pancake\" lens)Quirky menus (no real con, but it could still use work)Poor battery life (somehow it needs to be bigger) for rigorous use with the built in flash (using an external flash helps tremendously)Limited video usability indoors with kit lens (doesn't get enough light)You'll fall in love with the ecosystem and buy lots of lenses, flashes, etc... (really a pro, but your pocketbook sees it as a con)Simply put I love this camera.  It's speedy, delivers great results, offers great lenses, and other than battery life, I don't see any notable negatives.  It has it's quirks, and if your used to Canon or Nikon, it's just different (not really a con).  The one quirk that does annoy me (not a show stopper), is the film simulations.  It's great for someone who has used Fuji's professional films, but for anyone who never used film, only shot other brands, shot Fuji's consumer film, or simply forgot what things looked like, it's would be nice to also offer a more traditional way to adjust color profiles (some is offered via menus).  One mitigating factor is that the menus offer a preview of each simulation along with a quick description of each. These minor issues aside, everything else is done right, especially speed, AF accuracy, image quality, and ergonomics.  Simply put, everything looks great, and it's a joy to use.5 stars for an avid photographer coming from an advanced compact, a rangefinder, or a SLRI would be reluctant to recommend this to a novice (the similar and cheaper Fujifilm X-M1 would be a better choice), unless they're looking to learn more about exposure (then I'd wholeheartedly recommend this).I updated my review to clarify my concerns about battery life, which does improve dramatically when used with an external flash.  I continue to marvel at how well this camera works at high ISOs.  I regularly use it at ISO 800 with limited artifacts beyond my expectations for ISO 200.  This greatly enhances the usability of the kit lens with or without the built in flash.  Surprisingly, I use the excellent EVF sparingly, preferring to use the screen on back.  This likely won't be the case in bright daylight, but for indoor use, you may be satisfied with the X-M1 (same sensor, different lens, lower price).", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "A perfect combination of design, performance, and production values", "Author": "Ammy_Evaluator", "ReviewID": "R1BWEDKUQG42GA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a camera that feels as rich as it looks - with a body that is solidly constructed with magnesium alloy, and machined metal parts, along with an excellent rubberized grip; coupled with a classic rangefinder look.The included XF 18-55mm lens is a true star, with a popular focal range, reasonably fast (f/2.8-4), optically stabilized, and capable of producing images that are tack sharp and with pleasing color and contrast that rival those from my Zeiss lenses. It is also a joy to operate - with control rings for focus, zoom, and aperture. It even comes with a hood. In short, it would be a travesty to call this excellent performer a \"kit lens\".The X-E2 is truly an enthusiast's camera - with a plethora of manual controls coupled with awesome ergonomics and excellent software features.In addition to the controls on the lens, you also get manual control dials for shutter speed and exposure compensation; 4 customizable hard buttons; a Q button to access shooting parameters; a control wheel to adjust parameters and for Manual Focus assist; and a physical focus mode selector.I set the custom buttons as follows: [FN]=>ISO, [AF]=>focus point selection (more on this in a bit), [AE]=>self timer (helps to minimize camera shake), and [FN2]=>movie recording (there is no dedicated video button).Its stellar software features include the awesome Auto-ISO control and focus area selections. Auto-ISO not only lets you pick the min/max ISO limits, but also to set the min shutter speed. Once you've tried this feature, there is no going back. Really!Then, in Area AF mode, you specify up to 5 sizes of the focus rectangle, and pick any of 49 Autofocus points - that cover the entire sensor area.Even the menu system is logical and intuitive.Finally, I was surprised by the capable built-in flash (GN 7m @ ISO 200), which provided very even lighting without that harsh look characteristic of un-bounced strobes.While the camera comes with an electronic view finder (I've been a convert since the A99), the OLED panel is simply gorgeous and has been my go-to monitor on this camera.The negatives?My only annoyance was that the LCD was not articulated - a step backward in ergonomics, especially when taking low angle or high overhead shots. I personally did not care that it omits a touch screen (I prefer hard controls) and neither did I care for its Wifi feature (as it does not fit my digital processing workflow.)In conclusion, the X-E2 has enough head room for even the most committed professional to grow into, while at the same time providing enough support for those who want to go full auto.With its design, performance, and production values, this is going to be the benchmark for compact interchangeable lens APS-C cameras.Happy Photography!~A_E~", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really like this little fellow...", "Author": "TLavine", "ReviewID": "RR0X2GA6UT9UL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been shooting with this camera for the past two weeks.

This new Fujifilm X-E2 takes a pretty big leap forward in closing the gap on these two extremes.The X-E2 is a fully capable camera right out of the box. Apparently the first generation of these cameras were somewhat infamous for their slow autofocus - I saw no such problems with the E2. The included 18-55mm lens was a great inclusion allowing you to both portrait and landscape style shots right out of the box. Not the fastest lens out there, and it was a bit sluggish in low light in my opinion, but it's still a great single carry lens.Aesthetics, you love it or you don't.

The body and styling look very similar to the various cameras my parents used to take on vacation. The slim body is very small and easy to just take along with you on whim. However with the big DSLR manufacturers stepping it up with their pancake lens offerings, it's getting harder to pick between the two. Should you take a small bodied mirrorless with a big lens, or a big bodied DSLR with a prime pancake? If Fuji put out a tiny little prime pancake lens, I could easily see putting this guy into a small neoprene case and dragging it along with you all the time. Right now, it's still very much a \"when I need a camera\" camera, not a spontaneous one.All-in-all, functionality-wise, it's a great camera with a lot of great functions. Fuji's also been in the photography game for as long as most people can remember, so you don't really have to worry about them going away any time soon. However, as with any camera investment, the money is not in the body but with the myriad of lenses you'll buy in the future. For this reason alone, I think I'd still do the majority of my camera work with my Canon, however the X-E2 is definitely making mirrorless cameras harder to ignore.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "This camera is build for me", "Author": "sean", "ReviewID": "R3O8ABGAVIYNS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow..!!!

I have used primarily Canon EOS cameras (film and then digital since the 10D) and more recently have been trying various mirrorless cameras as I have problems with carrying much weight and have been hoping the technology will advance to the point that I can get the same results (or close to it) without having to lug around a heavy camera and lens system. So far I've used mirrorless cameras from the Panasonic, Sony and Olympus lines, currently shooting with the Olympus E-P5, so I have considerable experience with competitors to this camera. None though have yet made me completely happy so I was very excited to try this one which had some compelling features to it.The Fujifilm X-E2 is definitely a bit of a throwback. It's been a long time since I've had a camera where so many settings were handled by separate dials. There's no doubt that this camera is one that you will love or hate as soon as you try it out. My initial impressions were that I didn't care for it very much, but the more I work with it, the more impressed I have been. I definitely have been highly impressed with it for shooting outdoors and in situations where I want to have pretty full control over what it is doing. I really love being able to configure things like maximum/minimum settings it will use in Auto (making me wonder why other cameras don't have this ability, it's such a no-brainer once  you see it!) Image quality is quite superb and the kit lens one of the best I've seen, it's definitely not the typical throw-away many kits lenses tend to be (which of course is why it adds a fair amount to the price). It's fast with f/2.8-4, very solidly made, and produces excellent images.I still don't always find it very intuitive where to find various settings and controls. Obviously this is something that comes with more experience with the camera, but compared to other cameras I've used, it's often very tricky to figure out how to get it to do what you want. As an example, the method of autofocus (manual vs. single vs. continuous) is set with a toggle on the front of the camera near the lens. It's kind of an annoying place for it, having to turn the camera around to change it, and more than once I've found I accidentally hit it and changed the setting inadvertently. Likewise there are very few of the types of shooting modes that most other cameras include these days. I don't typically find things like \"landscape\" or \"sports\" mode particularly useful but it's odd to find them completely missing here. While it does include a nice panorama mode, some of the things like \"scene\" modes that all the other mirrorless cameras I've used are not included here. You won't be able to set the camera for things like sunsets or night shots, so it's definitely a camera intended for more experienced photographers that know how to adjust the settings to get the results they want themselves. While for an advanced photographer this may be more of a plus than a minus, I'm enough of a dabbler to miss them and the ability at times to just quickly give control to the camera for a shot or two when I'm in a rush and don't want to think about it too much. Certainly custom settings will help if you want to set up a quick method of using all the automatic settings, but those take some time to set up and perfect, and it's odd to see a camera these days with so few of these kinds of specialized settings built in for specific shooting situations. The Olympus also can do time lapse photography which I was not able to find on the X-E2. On the flip side, there are some other capabilities it has that I am very impressed with, including dynamic range options, and AE-Lock and AF-Lock buttons. You also have two custom function buttons, these as well as the AE-L and AF-L buttons are all customizable. I appreciated that the panorama function also zips the photos in-camera versus the Olympus which does it in the external software app only. Exposure bracketing however is somewhat disappointing with only 3 frames with \u00b1 1 EV being available. For a camera that seems to target serious photobugs, this is an odd oversight.The X-E2 is clearly meant for photographers whose main intent for the camera is shooting photos, not just because of the control setup, but also the video capability which seems like a bit of an after-thought. There's no dedicated video button and options for video pretty limited compared to the E-P5 or most other cameras. As far as I've been able to find, there's not settings to change the type of video captured and only two size options, and choice of 30 or 60 fps. Hopefully firmware updates might improve this, and video quality is certainly very good with the 60 fps and HD capability. Full manual control is also available during video which is always a great plus as is focus peaking. The external mic port however is not a standard 3.5mm but 2.5 mm so won't work with most DSLR external mics. I'm guessing a 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter will do the trick but haven't been able to test this yet. The camera also has a wide variety of filters and film simulation options, not things that I tend to use much but many photographers may find useful for producing a variety of \"artful\" results with their photos.Speaking of which, the wifi setting is definitely a nice plus, I still dream of a camera with true wifi built in such that I can upload photos directly to social websites, but the capability here is similar to other cameras, where the camera links to your phone (which requires switching its wifi to the camera to link it up) and then moving photos to your phone so you can upload them from there. I did find the Fujifilm app pretty easy to use but barebones in terms of features. It only moves one photo at a time which can be kind of tedious if you have a lot of photos you want to download from the camera. However the download at least very fast so was not too serious an issue in most cases. The included software that lets you mark pictures for upload works for Windows only so as a Mac user was no help at all. Geotagging is available but the Fujifilm iOS app that includes it currently crashes too much for me to even test, but other users report issues with it not updating properly as you move to new locations, so will be looking for these issues to all get addressed in the future. Full remote control has been announced with the recent Fujifilm X-F1 camera so I'm hoping a firmware update will provide it here as well.Fuji touts the camera as having the \"fastest autofocus\" based on a hybrid autofocus system that includes both the typical contrast detection most mirrorless systems have with phase detection similar to DSLRs. The Olympus E-P5 touted its speed of autofocus which was definitely better than any mirrorless system I'd used before but still fell far short of my DSLR, so I was dubious about this camera doing all that much better. But I must say, the more I've been using it, the more impressed I've been. Granted, it still can't hold up against my Canon with my best sports lens attached. But compared to the Olympus, it's ability to track and focus quickly on a moving subject is definitely far better. I was even able to get some decent shots of my dogs running and playing in my yard, which given that one of my dogs is almost solid black (and VERY fast!) is pretty good indeed. Still for every good shot I get, there's still several failures, but I expect it should do a far better job with slower moving subjects such as taking pictures at my nephew's sporting events.Where I've been most disappointed with it is the low light performance of the autofocus. While the image quality is excellent with little noise even at fairly high ISOs, it sometimes struggles to focus even in reasonably lit indoor rooms. The E-P5 I've had success with autofocus in almost completely dark rooms, this camera has issues even in almost normal indoor lighting at times. I've been playing around a bit with setting the size of the autofocus area, which seems to help, but I would like to see better performance here in general. I also was excited to find that that flash can be tilted back to bounce similar to the Sony NEX cameras (something the E-P5 cannot do) but my results with this have been pretty hit or miss, as would be expected with a non-documented feature. However, without tilting it, the flash gave me pretty nice results for this type of built-in flash. There's a lot of options for flash, from auto, to forced flash, suppressed flash, slow syncro and various red eye reduction modes, as well as the ability to control an external flash with it....however oddly enough that doesn't even work with Fuji's own TTL flashes. They hopefully will put more attention into improving their off-camera TTL offerings in the future as this is a big hole in the line right now. But as far as the on-camera flash, I've been happy with the results I've gotten and even with my dogs and cat I get a lot less red eye than most built-in flashes tend to produce indoors, even without using the red eye reduction modes. There is also an in-camera red-eye removal, although it did not seem to have much success locating and removing red eye unless it was VERY red.There's some things that make this camera feel like it's still behind the curve a bit, the lack of an articulating LCD screen, and lack of a touchscreen. Once you've had the ability to set focus by just tapping on your screen you really miss it when you have to do it through a menu. Likewise the screen with all the settings (Q button) just takes more time to move the cursor down to the setting you want to change versus being able to just tap on it. Minor things maybe, but any photographer knows, seconds can matter when it comes to getting the shot! I was very happy to see a built in viewfinder here, which is almost as good at the one on the Olympus, that one being the best electronic viewfinder I've ever used. But with the Olympus you can't use both the viewfinder and an attached external flash or microphone as they both use the accessory port and/or hotshoe, so a built in viewfinder is definitely a big plus here and really puts this camera ahead for me. I've added a thumb grip which would not be an option without having the empty hotshoe to hold it. The Olympus viewfinder feels a big roomier and brighter to me, and I didn't notice as many issues with refresh rate when using it, but this is definitely very close to it in quality, which is impressive for a built-in EVF.Overall, there's a lot to like about this camera. Image quality particularly at high ISOs and the traditional dials for settings are definitely going to be a real attraction for many photographers. And if shooting good still photos is your sole reason for buying this style of camera, and you know your stuff, you will not be disappointed. But it definitely has hard competition in cameras like the Olympus PEN E-P5. They meet it pretty closely on IQ while continuing to include a wide array of additional shooting options, from advanced \"intelligent\" auto modes, better video options, and equally impressive array of add-on lenses and other options like external flash, microphones, remotes, etc. But the more I've used this camera, the more I've been sold on it as my current camera of choice. My initial rating of 4 stars has gone up to 5 (mainly because there isn't a 4-1/2 star option!) and I find that the pluses of the camera like the fast autofocus and tracking outweigh some of the negatives (such as the lack of articulating LCD screen and touchscreen). I will be interested to see if Fujifilm continues to improve this camera which such capability in the future because it really could be the camera to beat all others. The recently announced X-F1 does include an articulating screen so hopefully that will make it down into the lower priced models in the future as well.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for beginners", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RV9DNHJZNRYUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have recently started photography and I consider myself as a beginner.

Of course, the S100 takes great photos, but nothing close to what I can take with my SLR.  The Fuji-Film X-E2 takes a great spot in that niche, a light camera with exchangeable lenses that weighs under 1 lb 7oz, making it far easier to bring on hikes when my 3+ lb DSLR just would not be feasible.First, getting started with this camera is superfast.  Put on the included 18-55mm lens and start taking photos.  The Auto mode works pretty well, but anyone looking at this camera will want to go beyond the toys such as panorama and miniature mode, and get into the real detailed settings.As I did not own an X-E1, I can't do a direct comparison, but I will say the feature set impressed me.  The screen on the back is beautiful and bright, and the controls are easy to access.  The top dial, rather than rotating through preset modes, allows you to directly adjust shutter speed settings without diving into a preset menu.  The same is true for exposure settings.  With the beautifully large APS-C image sensor in here (normally only available in larger cameras), you will be tweaking and adjusting to get just the right image, so easy access to the controls is a great feature.Image quality is superb, and quite above my pocket point-and-shoot.  It is hard to do a direct comparison to my 50D since the glass on my 50D is different than the kit lens, but the included kit lens works quite well.  I'd say the 50D does seem to autofocus and take action shots faster, but the quality of the general images is quite comparable.One feature I could not find, which disappointed me, was the ability to auto-review a photo after taking it.  The photo disappears and you have to go back and view it.  I poured through the manual looking for this function, but came up short.  If someone reading my review knows how to do this, please let me know.Another cool feature is the built-in flash.  Everyone expects a built-in flash with a camera like this to stink, and well, it does.  But it is also on a flexible stand which allows you to take your finger and point it at the ceiling for some reflected lighting.  Very cool!  None of my other cameras with built in flashes let me do that.  I don't know if it was by design, but it is useful nontheless.For a lightweight camera with some features that blow away my DSLR, and certainly is better than my point and shoot, this is highly recommended.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera and a nice improvement over the X-E1", "Author": "Andrew P.

This is a camera anyone can use right out of the box but also one that you can spend years learning to master.The retro look and styling are very attractive but they made it, for me at least who was used to an extended grip on the camera body, a little hard to handle. I found myself hitting the AE-L and AF-L buttons often and frequently by accident spun the exposure compensation dial without even realizing I had. I resolved this with the LensMate Thumb Grip designed for the X-E1/E2. It made a good camera great. I also added LensMate's brass soft release button to the shutter release. It does aid in smoother pressing of the shutter button but it also looks great on the camera.The 18-55mm lens that comes with the X-E2 is a real pleasure to use. The zoom is stiff enough to let you feel in control but easy enough that you don't need brute force to use it.Image quality, even at 100%, is outstanding. I've been getting so many 'keepers' that I've had to reevaluate my shooting style. I feel like I'm overshooting. In the past I was shooting three or four hundred images in an outing and getting maybe four or six shots I really want to keep and share. Now, with the X-E2 I'm finding two, three even four times that many shots that are worth keeping. I'm going to need a bigger hard drive!Battery life has been pretty good for me. Even shooting in temperatures down in the 30's and 40's I had no problem taking well over three hundred images and still having battery bars left. In the times I've gone out all day wandering around the county I've yet to have to swap out the battery though I did purchase an extra just to have around.Functionality, configurability and controls are extensive and a bit quirky but easy enough to get used to. As an example the Q button gives you 'Q'uick access to many of the more necessary and often used controls. You navigate around the Q menu with the 5-way controller but you make setting changes with the command dial. One of the features I found most interesting was the ability to constrain the ISO in Auto mode and set a minimum shutter speed. I also liked the ability to configure the four letter prefix for file names. All the 'extra' settings like special effects, double exposure, movie mode and panorama are accessed through the Drive button.I did find a couple small negatives. Nothing to cause me not to want to use it but made me wonder. The odd menu systems. The pop-up flash is a bit anemic and is somewhat blocked by the 18-55mm lens. It's even worse when the hood is attached. The shoulder strap that comes with the camera... I know they're usually bad but this is cheap camera bad not quality camera bad. I put it around my neck, gave a tug, and then threw it away without putting it on the camera. I expected a little more quality there. The tulip lens hood that comes with the 18-55mm feels hard and brittle. It too could have been a bit better quality. I already mentioned the LensMate thumb grip that I think is an absolute must add item (it's really worth the cost). My big clumsy hands desperately needed it to aid in stability and control.Where to start with a conclusion? This is an interesting mix of old school retro styling and modern camera technology. I think Fuji have really blended them together well. I can see myself enjoying this camera for years to come. Very highly recommended.{Update}Not wanting to pile on the negatives but I had intended to and completely forgot to mention the battery door. It's really kind of flimsy and feels like it could easily break. Also, with the way it's hinged I find it rather hard to get the memory card out of the camera because it's so close and parallel to the battery door's hinge.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera in a compact body", "Author": "John D.", "ReviewID": "R98DFNQO5LJZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best camera I've owned so far.

Major props to Fuji but let's not get too carried away and the honesty kicks in.  First off the autofocus is slow, loud and inaccurate.  I purchased this with the 23mm 1.4 and it is a great lens but it's slowww and struggles to focus in well lit rooms!  Think focus speed of a canon eos M or canon 5d in a dark room and that's what this feels like.  What this camera is great for is that it's great for landscapes or travel.  It's great if you have that great view when you travel and you want to be able to capture that.  What this camera is not great for is people.  Simply put this focus is so slow and inaccurate you will not be able to capture those babies that are taking their first steps, kids running across the room, people mingling, or any sort of street photography.  I thought that I was going to use this side by side with my dlsr for weddings but I had no need for this camera.  The shutter is as loud as a dslr that too and that too is pretty disappointing.  People will notice you focusing and will obviously hear that loud shutter.  The battery is a joke!  I've had this for 3 weeks now and I've gotten about 150-200 pictures per battery with high performance off.  With that on your looking at about 125 pics or real life scenario 30-40 minutes with the camera.  This would of been the perfect camera if it was say $500 but for $1000 your placing yourself at the high end and premium side especially when there are better cameras out there and much cheaper.  In the end I ended up selling it and sticking with the dlsr or someday the x100s.  The evf was a great improvement over the xe1 which I too had again I sold that too because it was a pretty terrible camera.  But the Evf is still pretty terrible in low light.  It still lags and it just strained your eyes if you use it a long time like me.  Looking through that screen I still prefer a real life view.  You are putting your eyes only millimeters away from that screen.If you want a mirrorless look at the competition.  They are by far better and cheaper for what fuji offers.  I realized that though I liked the compact size it made no sense to keep it.  The Fuji xe2 loses its compact size once you have to carry all those batteries to keep up with a dslr.  In the end it just made better sense to carry a dslr because it was the lighter option.Pros:Good designGreat imagesCompact size which is questionable?Cons:Loud focusLoud shutter for a mirrorlessbad autofocusbad Battery lifeTerrible video (iso only goes to 1600).  It would of been better if fuji just took off this out.  Why put in video if you're not even going to try at it.More expensive than the competition and not better performanceI say if you are really looking into the Fuji xe2 rent or borrow one before you buy it.  The only way to truly get a feel for it is try it.  I did and didn't like it.  Others will love it.

I have owned quite a few point-and-shoot digital cameras over the years -- my current one is the Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS, which I am quite happy with.

Overall, I like this camera.=============================================================EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:PROS:-APS-C sensor, the sensor is larger than many cameras, and of good quality-X-Trans II CMOS Sensor, the sensor type isn't top-of-the-line CCD, but it is still good-Phase Detection, it has good auto focusing (and has 49 focus points, which beats all but professional grade cameras)-EXR Processor II, the camera's processor is fast, which enables fast booting times, and continuous shooting-Large Electronic Viewfinder, it has a viewfinder with an information overlay that basically shows what the LCD shows-Wireless Transfer, you can transfer files to your phone or computer wirelessly-High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging, a cool way to take vivid pictures-Continuous Focus For Movie Filming, allows the camera to be used pretty much like a camcorder-Has An External Mic Port, useful for filming in higher noise areas-Can Create Panoramas In The CameraCONS:-Slightly Smaller Resolution Photos, professional and entry-level DSLRs tend to beat the Fujifilm X-E2 on image resolution (not by much, though)-Camera Body Not Weather Sealed-No Flip-Out Screen-Lower Quality Viewfinder, the nicer professional cameras have more features built into the viewfinder, and more luxury options-Smaller LCD than some nicer DSLRs, and most professional cameras-Lower Maximum ISO, professional and nicer DSLRs have a higher maximum ISO range=============================================================So, with all of that being said, let's talk about the Fujifilm X-E2. Interestingly, while I have been watching the advanced camera market develop, SLR developed to DSLR, and now the market is kind of branching out from there in several directions. The new direction in the market which everyone seems to be talking about though, is mirrorless.The Fujifilm X-E2 is indeed a mirrorless camera. To be precise, it is a mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera. I had to look up what mirrorless meant, in camera terms. Basically, it means it can be less bulky because the mirrors in the old 35mm cameras, and the (D)SLR cameras that followed them, took up a lot of room, as did the pentaprisms that converted vertical rays to horizontal in the viewfinder. With a mirrorless camera, those things aren't needed anymore, hence the smaller camera body size. An advanced camera with a mirror system also had a mounting system and \"flange distance\" that was identical to the older 35mm cameras -- that allowed photographers to use their existing stock of lenses on the new digital camera bodies. That allowed them to transition to digital much cheaper than if they would have had to buy entirely new equipment. So, if you are a professional photographer who still has and uses lenses meant for a mirrored camera, then the mirrorless camera systems are still probably going to be a deal breaker for you, as for the most part (there are some adapters, but not many) your older lenses won't work in a mirrorless camera body.Aside from being a mirrorless camera, the Fujifilm X-E2 sports the following features (I researched all this, I am not a professional photographer, so please excuse any errors or misunderstandings):APS-C sensor: After some research, I found that that stands for: Advanced Photo System type-C. It means it is an image sensor format equal in size to the Advanced Photo System \"classic\" size negatives. Those negatives were 25.1 \u00d7 16.7 mm and had an aspect ratio 3:2.  Basically, the larger the sensor, the better the image captured (due to higher resolution). The APS-C sensor is a fairly large sized sensor. The only 2 sizes larger I found in my research were the APS-H, and 35mm \"full frame\". There are quite a lot of smaller sensor sizes.X-Trans II CMOS Sensor:  CMOS is just the type of sensor being used (as opposed to CCD). CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) sensors are cheaper than CCD (charge-coupled device) sensors. X-Trans II, as far as I can tell, is just the brand name of the sensor that Fujifilm gave it. A CMOS sensor isn't technically as good as a CCD sensor, but they are MUCH cheaper than a CCD sensor, and they consume FAR less power. So it is a trade-off.  CCD sensors tend to be put into cameras meant for high-resolution/high-quality shots with a high density of pixels. CMOS sensors tend to be put into cameras that don't have to hit those high marks. BUT, the latest generation of CMOS censors (like the X-Trans II) are getting pretty close to the quality of CCD sensors!Phase Detection: Basically, this is the auto-focus that happens when you press the shutter button down part way. The more advanced/new the camera is, the better this system tends to work. It works even better with lenses that can be manually focused as well, which the Fujifilm X-E2 has. The only real numbers to look for if you are shopping around specifically for phase detection, are the number of focus points. The Fujifilm X-E2 has 49. More is better. All of that leads into auto focusing. Basically, the better the phase detection system, the better and faster the auto focus. The Fujifilm X-E2 claims an auto focus speed of 0.08 seconds. In my use of the camera, that seems about right. It focuses pretty much instantly.EXR Processor II: This is the computer running the camera. The faster it is, the better the camera will work, and the more responsive it will be. The processor in this camera uses a dual CPU. Basically, what the processor enables (or hinders, depending on its quality) is high speed continuous shooting, and high speed start-up times.  Continuous shooting refers to how fast the camera can take images one after another in rapidly. The Fujifilm X-E2 claims about 7 fps (frames per second, which is roughly equal to 7 pictures per second). In my tests, if using the built-in flash, this number is much lower after the first 4 or 5 shots, as the system then has to recharge itself. You need to use an externally powered flash to keep this number consistent.Electronic Viewfinder: The camera has a viewfinder with an information overlay that shows (basically) the same information as is displayed on the LCD, onto the viewfinder. The viewfinder is activated when you put your face up to the camera. It is actually pretty cool.Wireless Transfer: you can setup your camera to wirelessly transfer files to your phone or computer.  I tested that a couple of times. It does work, but it didn't really wow me. I think that feature would be far more impressive to a professional photographer than an amateur like me. Basically, think of a photo studio where the photographer can be taking pictures, and while doing so the camera is sending them to the computer to be previewed by customers, and prints ordered right then and there, while the photographer continues to work. That's the kind of scenario I can see this feature being super-useful in. For me ...meh.High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging: a professional photographer I know, had to tell me about this. The Fujifilm X-E2 supports HDR photography through what Fujifilm calls \"Bracketing.\" On the Fujifilm X-E2, the setting is called the \"Dynamic Range Bracketing\" setting. What is High Dynamic Range? It is taking the same picture multiple times (you pretty much have to use a tripod if doing it without a camera that can do it automatically) with different exposures. So, the same image is captured with low light levels, mid light levels, and high light levels. Then the images are merged together, creating an image that has both deep shadows and good lighting in the light spots, without washing out or not having enough light on the main subject of the shot. The Fujifilm X-E2 also supports other types of \"bracketing\" like film simulation, AE, and ISO Sensitivity...........................................................Comparisons:..........................................................The Fujifilm X-E2 Compared to other mirrorless interchangeable-lens competitors:ADVANTAGES:-larger viewfinder-continuous focus for movie filming-sports external mic port-CMOS sensorDISADVANTAGES:-lower max ISO-no movie recording at 24 frames per second-no flip-out screen..........................................................The Fujifilm X-E2 Compared to Professional DSLR competitorsADVANTAGES:-larger viewfinder-slightly faster continuous shooting-can create panoramas in the camera-continuous focus for movie filming-more focus points (49)DISADVANTAGES:-smaller LCD-smaller resolution photos-lower maximum ISO-camera body not weather sealed..........................................................The Fujifilm X-E2 Compared to Entry-level DSLR competitorsADVANTAGES:-higher quality movie recording-larger viewfinder-slightly faster continuous shooting-can create panoramas in the camera-more focus points (49)DISADVANTAGES:-slightly smaller resolution photos-camera body not weather sealed-no flip-out screen-lower quality viewfinder..........................................................[comparisons source: snapsort]Other research sources used for this review include: photography life, and how-stuff-works(not giving their addresses, because that isn't allowed in reviews)..........................................................Overall, if you aren't a professional photographer (or you are one who is just starting out), and you don't have a large collection of older-type lenses to use on your camera, then I think this camera will do just fine for most uses. I certainly have found nothing wrong with it.5 stars.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Significant improvements", "Author": "Rene Dietrich Trigo", "ReviewID": "R25I3SKBYK5AOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Much improved from the XE 1.

I did the upgrade and I'm happy", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Refined enough for me to give my SLR the boot?", "Author": "michael paniagua", "ReviewID": "R244YK14OX2V3U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start off by stating that I am a Canon user and have been for easily 6 years, had a 20D for a while and now own a 7D and a 5Dmkiii as well as an old 1D Mkii.Unboxing the item everything was as expected, packaged well and brand new, had that new camera smell! First impressions were of quality, the camera felt well constructed, not heavy but sturdy. I am used to canon kit lenses so when I opened this one up I was very surprised, the kit lens has a metal housing and zooms out and retracts with a firm quality feel to it. Best kit lens I have ever owned!I bought this camera for: Image quality and size. Also I could use my old Minolta lenses with use of an inexpensive adapter.Took the battery out and put it in the camera, put the lens, put a class 10 SD card in the camera and turned this thing on. Went through the menus quickly and set the things I knew and went out to take some night photos. The camera showed 2/3 battery power which was surprising because who ships a battery that is charged? Messed with the camera around the house to check how well it would lock on focus on dimly lit areas as well as bright areas. The AF system is really fast, I am not sure if it is faster than my 5Dmkiii but it is quick. I honestly felt the 5D did a much better job focusing on dim areas with low contrast (Plum colored wall a shadow).So far my three complaints about the camera.The Ergonomics: Since I am used to Canon and I know where all the functions are at (and I should get more comfortable with this in time) I know I can pull the 5D out of the bag, flip it on quick and through the viewfinder quickly compose the shot and at the same time set ISO, Aperture and Shutter all with my left hand with my eye never leaving the viewfinder. The X-E2, I pull out and turn the dials for the correct shutter speed with my left hand, compose the shot while looking at the metering and turning the aperture ring on the lens and hoping that I am set at a ISO that will work for me. Otherwise I need to then open the menu find one that might work, recompose the shot and meter it once again and hope my guess was right, if not open the menu again and increase, if not then fix my aperture and take the picture. On the other hand I can just keep whatever settings in auto, or all settings in auto, and use the camera. But for me, I don't think you spend the money on this kind of camera to use it in auto all the time. This might be because I am still new at using it and I have not set things the way I like them, if that is possible.LCD Display: The display is great but the problem is that if you shoot a picture and one of your settings is in auto (in my case ISO) and  you are shooting in a dimly lit environment and you push the shutter halfway down to engage Auto Focus, the screen lightens up and you take a picture of what you think was shown on the screen. Wrong! You just took a vastly underexposed image. Every camera I have had, once it focuses and locks on, shows you about what you are getting for a shot, not this one. In this case it should show me something very dark and underexposed so I would say \"oh crap, I better change my settings!\" I hope this is something that is changed in a firmware update, this might be a setting that I am completely unfamiliar with too but I don't know why anyone would want this to work like this?1/2 Ergonomics Again: Because there is only a small rubbery bump on the right side of the body and outside of that its like a rectangle. Nothing good to grab on to. Because I don't want to drop this camera it tends to be more of a 2 hand operation camera. I can grab the 5D as well as this camera with one hand, hold it out and compose my shot and hit the shutter and get it. But this camera just feels less secure, a little more slippery than either of my canon cameras and in order to make any quick fine tuned adjustments (like shutter speed) I need to move my hands from the regular shooting position. I don't want to be overly critical of this because I knew going in where the controls were going to be on this camera and I knew the shape of it. Fuji doesn't design a camera to just make me happy, I get it! At the same time I had an NEX-3 for a month and didn't have any lack of confidence in the grip and feel of the camera for one handed operation.Battery Life: So the battery I put in the camera turned out to be on the verge of dying. I think I got maybe 30 shots out of the camera before it quit. The battery was at room temperature when I put it in the camera so there is no reason it should have read as having 2/3 power. So this appears to be a battery life indicator I cannot trust.What I do like:-Auto Focus is blazing fast! When it is in Multi-Point though it doesn't show you what points it has focused on, this may be a setting I haven't turned on.-Very fast burst mode!-Good Build Quality-Quality Kit Lens-Very sharp imagesI am currently working on some side by side comparison shots of this camera and my Canon 7D. Considering the 7D was released in 2009 it should dominate the 7D in all areas. I understand this is a different style of camera, the 7D is an SLR and the Fuji is not however AF has been the main issue for mirrorless cameras and Fuji claims this is the fastest in the world, a bold claim so this should have nothing holding it back from dominating a 4 year old camera with 4 year old technology.Overall good camera but I am holding off my complete judgement if it is a great camera.UPDATE** 12-04-2013 **I ended up returning the camera because I could not get past the fact it only effectively has one auto focus point. The auto focus is fast, no question, but so is my 7D, 5Dmkiii and 1Dmkii when only using one AF point. You can change the location of the AF point and the size of the AF Zone but like most SLR cameras there is not a multi point AF working when taking photos. Even though there are many AF Points only one is used at a time. Also when film lenses were used (Minolta MD Mount with Fotodiox adapter) the focus peaking was very light and not as easy to see as was on my Sony NEX-3. Split focus was good but still not as easy as it should be or I am used to on my film cameras.I could also not get past the fact that ISO had to be changed through a menu and not a dedicated knob, at the very least ONE quick button. The quick button you need to hit, position over to ISO and then turn the wheel to adjust. It was just slow to do and if I am out taking pictures on the street or with kids I want to be able to take the camera out of the bag quick, fire it up and shoot. I don't want to see miss a shot because I my ISO happen to be set wrong and then I have to go through a menu. You could just leave it on AUTO, but I am not a fan of auto settings. I think if you want auto settings then just buy a point and shoot.I don't like that there is no dedicated video button, if you want to change from still photography to video you need to go through the menu. I am used to being able to just hit the button and change. When in video mode it was weird to push the shutter button down to start recording and push it again to stop recording. Not bad, just odd. I think there should be a video button, just another thing that requires you to use a menu and slows operation.There is no denying pictures from this camera are sharp, the AF is blazing fast and the size and weight at great but it doesn't take pictures that are much better than my old 7D and the ergonomics of the button layout and menu configuration is not as easy as Canon cameras. I am not Canon fanboy and I keep looking for something to get me to leave Canon forever. The X-E2 is getting close but still not good enough for me to part with 1400 dollars.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great step up for the Fuji X line...be aware of the focus problems.", "Author": "R.

But, they had to.  The X-E2 fixes so many things that people hated about the X-E1.Faster autofocus, better image quality, and richer features and enhanced ergonomics are just a small sliver of the laundry list of fixes that the X-E2 adds.For me personally, I am a Canon guy.  I have had every x0D SLR since inception.  Switching to the mirrorless format was interesting for me.  I kept waiting to head the mirror flip every time I pushed the shutter release, alas there was no mirror.While this camera serves a different market than the prosumer SLR, the quality is very similar between the two.  I was amazed at the ISO performance from the included kit lens (even at 6400!).  I did experience some hiccups with the autofocus system that I wanted to highlight for the potential buyer.  On several occasions i could not get the camera to focus on the foreground, instead many photos were focused on the background.  I've read in a couple forums that this is known issue with this model and that Fuji is working on a fix via a firmware update.In terms of video, this thing is able to capture 1080p at 60fps with no issues.  Unlike the Canon 7D, this X-E2 is able to auto-focus on the fly during video capture which I find to be hugely helpful and necessary for video capture.All in all, I think I will switch to this for my vacation shots where I need a smaller form factor and don't want the bulk of the SLR.  However, given my current love of the SLR and the flexibility/ruggedness that comes with the bigger body, I'm still going to shoot a bulk of my shots with the SLR.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "amazing camera!", "Author": "Ariel Concepcion", "ReviewID": "R1J0DH0XELQVAM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first camera and I love it!, it takes sharp pictures and its the right size to carry around all the time, especially for street photography.
