{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great slow motion movies, wish it had 60fps HD mode", "Author": "P. Chen", "ReviewID": "R1AHD926QSXJIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for the high speed movies that Casio has a reputation for.  It works very well, and was cheaper and more suitable for recording myself playing tennis than, say the Go Pro Hero Black.  I was worried that the delivery from Japan would take awhile, but it arrived within a week!  The display is nice and the controls are such that you can record yourself and watch yourself on the camera screen for instant feedback.  I found that the 480fps was too grainy to be useful.  Even the 240fps is a bit of overkill for what I wanted to see, and the resolution goes down.  The 120fps seemed to be the most useful.  I wish it had a 60fps HD mode!  That is actually a good mode for watching yourself on a larger screen.  The picture gets kind of sparkly at low light, like at dusk or under lights.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006596QTO"}}
