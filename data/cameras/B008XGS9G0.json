{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Camera in it's Class.  PERIOD.", "Author": "NuReality \"nureality2\"", "ReviewID": "R3I9PLX63SMHAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying I've been shooting for over 25 years now and have pretty particular needs in my gear.  I wanted a compact with a decent \"normal\" zoom range, good IQ, and usable ISO up to 400/800. When I got the previous model of this camera, the TL500 (EX1 to the rest of the world), I was extremely pleased with a camera rich in features, sporting the (then) fastest lens in a compact (f/1.8-2.4), 24-72mm equivalent, 45 user-selectable AF-points (and very easy and quick to do) RAW shooting, AEB (actual shooting dial setting, which being something I use often for HDR is nice), and controls that were closest to an SLR's (which was a major selling point for me).  The TL500 had incredible IQ (Image Quality), fantastic color rendition, decent ISO and very clean noise handling up to 400 (and usable 800 for the most part). It's shortfalls? there were some, namely on the video side - VGA only, and not the fastest continuous shooting modes.Then the EX2F came along, and it addressed all of my wishlist items for the TL500's replacement and came with more features (for such a camera) than I'd thought to even ask for.What's new this time?1. 24-80mm f/1.4-2.7 lens - a little longer but a 1/2-stop faster+ throughout the range2. 12MP - more detail from the new sensor and faster lens. (But they did do something very nice in that you can choose what size shot AND what format (i.e. RAW or JPG) as well as shooting dual formats at once at that size... so if you want to cut down on file size, you can choose 10MP, or smaller)3. Cleaner ISO noise up to ISO1600 (ISO goes up to 12800 with expansion)3. FullHD 1080p Video w/ continuous auto focus, plus up to 6 photo frames WHILE shooting video4. 3 continuous shooting modes - 3fps, 5fps, & 10fps modes. (warning: you can't shoot  RAW in these modes, just JPG, but this is still super cool in a compact like this)6. Better AEB (Auto Exposure Bracketing) - easier setup and 2 bracketing settings now.7. Tracking AF (it actually works decent, not SLR-grade, but surprisingly good)8. Built-in ND3 Neutral Density filtering. (This can't be stressed enough for its usefulness to shooters enjoying fast lenses such as this for the first time, the ability to shoot wide-open and still play with shallow DOF in a sunny day can't be overlooked.  Bravo to Samsung for this.)9. SMART Wireless Connectivity - WiFi connectivity thru your phone to upload pics to Facebook and other social services, so you can shoot and post live basically.Also, smartphone remote control of the camera (for remote shooting) and filesharing/viewing, as well as AllShare WiFi slideshows and video transmission.10. Live Photo filters and Video filters - quite fun.11. In-camera editing features, in-camera movie compiling.12. HDR mode (I prefer to do it old-school way with AEB though).13. Improved 3.0\" AMOLED screen.14. The body is slightly smaller than the TL500, and the strap is nicer.15. Added WB choices including Custom WB modes. (If you know what a 18% grey card is, then you know why this is useful)Basically, its A LOT to LOVE.Pros:1. Fast & Sharp (even wide open) 24-80mm (equivalent) f/1.4-2.7 lens. - The extra 8mm at the long end you'll never really feel, but the extra 1/2 stop faster lens throughout does help especially at dusk and dawn.2. Control Wheel in back (for aperture control) + finger dial under shutter (for shutter speed control) = MANUAL SHOOTER'S DREAM3. 12MP RAW shooting.4. FullHD 1080p Video + simultaneous photo shooting.5. SMART camera = WiFi enabled, connectivity with your smartphone for filesharing, remote camera control, watching photos and videos on compatible tv's, a lot of fun stuff there.5. 3 continuous shooting modes including 3fps, 5fps, and 10fps.6. New \"Fn\" button gives you access to ALL shooting-specific settings in one well organized place7. Great ergonomics and the afforementioned 2 control setup.8. Fully articulated screen allows you to shoot some otherwize uncomfortable angles.9. Uses the old battery as well as the new one (so for me, a small savings).Con's:1. The famous \"please remove the lens cap\" message and the need to hit the power button again... I'm used to it from the TL500, but its a bit of a nuisance.  (I do understand the need for this given the sensor/magnet/whatever in the lens cap reporting that it's there; but this camera is (mainly) designed for people who KNOW how to use a camera, and informing me that I forgot to take the lens cap off, is kind of insulting.)2. The controls from the TL500 have pretty much ALL stayed in the same place except for the right direction on the d-pad/wheel which was the ISO button on the TL500 and on the EX2F this is now the WiFi/Transmit button and the ISO setting now resides in the \"Fn\" button's menus.  I mostly shoot Manual, so for me, having to change ISO can be a regular thing and needing to go into a menu for it isn't better, its slower, i.e. WORSE.3. The fancy description screens that come up everytime you change the mode-dial.  Not necessary, its just fluff.4. I wish Samsung would give a \"SMART\" AutoISO feature.  Basically, if I know I like ISO's 80-800 only because of noise-levels and color-rendition (for whatever reason basically) let me select \"MY\" Auto Range.  I don't use AutoISO because I don't like shooting in anything higher than 1600 and even that as a last ditch effort.5. I wish there was an option for a Wireless Mic (Bluetooth maybe?) for video.6. The camera is capable of 10fps, why not throw in a fast-framerate for video too?  That would be nice.Basically, the Con's are the \"lens cap\" message, and the moving of the ISO button, and the pop-up screens telling me I'm in Manual mode and what it means (\"Really?!?!?!?, Thanks, I KNOW what Manual means, that's why I chose it.\"), and the rest are a wishlist for what might be done better in the EX3.Long story short, go get it.

Ishizue \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R2D69GQKRJQ6ER", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for over a month now for the purpose of having a good quality travel point-and-shoot that could rival the image quality of my old Canon G6 for still shots with a brighter lens and have a decent HD video camera that could rival my Sony DSC-HX9V with much better sound quality in a single package. Well, every objective except one that I had with this camera was met. The low light light performance and image quality on both settings were outstanding, as advertised. However, the one glaring weakness in the EX2F was where Sony had the clear advantage - image stabilization while recording video. Sony is still the undisputed king when it comes to this area. The easiest way to test this is by simply walking while shooting video. The Sony with its Active Image Stabilization on is so solid that the image looks like it glides as you move forward while the EX2F looks like it's on a very bumpy road making the video very difficult to watch. Yes, it may be possible to correct this via software later in post production, but this is an extra process that can take additional time and effort when it could be resolved by the camera's stabilizer in the first place. The sound quality blows the Sony out of the water (it can record good rich bass!) plus having an articulated OLED screen is also a plus when shooting video. I have contacted Samsung Technical Support if the \"Dual Stabilization\" mode was operable for video and the response that I received was not encouraging since it only works for still shooting. That's why I ended up using both cameras during my recent trip to Walt Disney World. Both cameras had their strengths and weaknesses, but the image stablilizer technology is what always keeps Sony in the game because no other manufacturer that I've seen so far (Canon, Casio, Nikon, Panasonic, Pentax, Olympus, and now Samsung) even comes close with the point-and-shoots (small and compact size is very important when I am always running around trying to keep up with my 2-yr old toddler). So for the EX2F, kudos for every other category except for an effective IS for video. Update (6/22/13) - This camera has become my go-to camera because of the superior audio when shooting video. I also own the Zoom Q3 HD and the Olympus LS-20M, and I could say without a doubt that the EX2F sounds better than either of the two. That is high praise when you consider that you get better HD video and audio in a single package. I have used this to record live bands and night clubs at high volumes and the recorded audio sounds rich in bass, full midrange, and crisp high's with very little distortion.Update (6/25/13): Despite the issues with image stabilization for video, the EX2F has become my go-to camera because of the sound quality and flexible OLED screen that I often use at the end of a monopod. I cannot say enough good things about the audio because it really is that good. I am really glad that Samsung has placed emphasis on the product design because this is often an afterthought from other manufacturers figuring that most users will never know the difference playing on their portable devices and not high quality sound sytems like in a home theater.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving the low light capabilities and the articulating screen.", "Author": "EC", "ReviewID": "R17ZKGNNDUAV83", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With a 20-month and a 2-month old, there's plenty of action to be captured at home, and so far this camera has lived up to my hopes for it for primarily indoor shooting at relatively close distances (don't zoom much; don't have DSLR):PROS1.  F1.4 keeps me from having to use flash my children's eyes, and allows me to capture at shutter speeds sufficient to keep the pictures from motion blur.  (I was using an old Canon G3, but even its F2.0 wasn't bright enough to allow for fast enough shutter speeds.)2.  F1.4 is great for filming indoor videos where lighting can be dim.  [25Oct2012 Additional info:  Image stabilization does work in video mode -- it can be turned on or off via the Fn function menu:  when \"off,\" my videos look like they were recorded with a smartphone that doesn't have stabilization; when \"on\", those small movements are smoothed out.]3.  Articulating screen + wide angle 24mm for DIY family portraits (at arm's length).  Being able to position the camera with the screen facing us saves a lot of time, and as you know, this time crucial for avoiding toddler restlessness.  Also, seeing his own smile in the front-facing screen grabs the attention of this toddler and so he is faced the correct direction.4.  Can pause a video recording by pressing a button and then recompose from a different position (like with the Nokia N8).  Home videos are ready to upload without further editing.5.  Dials (two on top, one in front by shutter) for mode, for timer settings/multiple frames/etc, and the front for exposure/WB/.  I often use the 2-second timer to reduce shake, and it's a simple dial click away.6.  Wi-fi direct allows me to send by email or transfer a good photo to the Samsung Galaxy S3.CONS1.  Whenever the mode dial is changed, the screen shows a description of what that mode does.  This helps when learning how to use the camera but isn't necessary later.  It disappears by itself after a second or two or goes away when camera functions are initiated (ie shutter is slightly depressed)2.  Whenever lens cap is left on and the camera is powered up, a message appears to remove it, but the camera needs to be turned off and then on before it can shoot.Overall, with the low light capabilities and the articulating screen, we're capturing a lot of good memories and videos, and with Wi-fi, we are able to easily share with others.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung EX2", "Author": "Joseph C. Angert", "ReviewID": "R175QN8LH3ZYKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the EX2 as a replacement for my EX1. The EX1 was an excellent camera and the EX2 is incrementally better in all the ways that matter to me.Caveat: This is my carry-around camera. I wanted a compact I could take along anywhere. I'm a professional photographer and my only concern is the image quality I get from the camera taking still photos. I have not and never will use the camera's video function. I have not and never will use the silly stupid flash attached to the camera. As I only store raw files for the photos I take I have not and never will use the WiFi function built into the camera -- pretty silly to try and WiFi a 27mb file.The Schneider lens on the EX2 is superb and alone worth the price of the camera. I teach photography at the college level and my students bring in every DSLR brand available with their cheap kit zoom lens. The lens on the EX2 smacks them all down. My work camera is a Canon 5DmkII with Canon L series glass with which the lens on the EX2 is competitive.The AMOLED screen on the EX2 is beautiful -- best in the business and the fact that the screen is fully articulated is fabulous. The build quality on the EX2 is excellent. It's made out of this stuff called metal which is very uncommon in today's plastic world. It feels like a serious piece of hardware.I had a set of criteria for this camera that I was not willing to compromise. The zoom lens on the wide end had to reach a 24mm (35mm equivalent) -- check. The camera had to save raw data files -- check. The camera had to allow for full control -- check.It's obvious to me that the engineering team for the EX2 put image quality on the top of the priority list and then refused to compromise.

I'm just a leisure photographer and don't know much about the technical aspects of photography but this camera seems to do it all. It takes excellent indoor photos.

More visible in direct sunlight (you can't read the settings because of VERY SMALL and ODDLY SHAPED font but you can more or less frame) + I like to shoot at odd angles. The camera is fun if you can live with its quirks:1. The gut wrenching \"Remove the cap\" message. The worst part you can't go the MENU to preset the camera for shooting w/o removing the cap - plainly stupid.2. \"Help\" when changing the modes. Both a terrible slow down!3. Hoped they gave an option of disabling them in the new firmware. Nope + Samsung DOES NOT LIST what they have changed. You update \"as is\" ???4. Focusing is rater fast writing speed is not terrible (Sony SD 94Mb/s 32GB card) but on slowish side in RAW+super fine JPEG5. Zooming IS SLOW, especially for only x3 zoom. The lever is not very grippy when needed but can be accidentally move when not needed.6. No program-shift: in P-mode, you can't change A or S in it???7. Very good fill-in flash, pics look very natural but you have to pop-up the flash to change its setting. Pressing the dedicated flash button w/o opening the flash doesn't do anything!!!8. It does Hi-speed video (albeit shorter and lower res clips), if you set up continuous shooting at 3-5-10fps on the left dial, movie mode on the mode dial and hit the red record button. 10fps is limited to 1min but being able to switch between 60-120-240-480 via a physical dial is very handy. The main problem - only60p allows to zoom during recording.With the latest firmware IS during video recording works fine. I haven't touched a camcorder in 12 years and got a very decent closeup following a dog at ~1ft holding the camera in stretched arms below my waist. Hopefully this is not an issue.9. Huge RAW files.Despite all this the camera is fun, especially for $250 on sale.

It fits the hand well and the controls are well laid out.  The grip is good and it just has that \"right\" feel when shooting.  Some cameras have it, some don't, this one has it.Build quality seems very good and the finish is very nice.  Good thumb area and grip on right front.  Metal body with some plastic, of course, but very solid feel overall.  Body is a tiny bit thicker than some, but I actually like that.  The 3 \" AMOLED screen is very good.  Yes, a view finder would be ideal (and it they made this same camera with a view finder for $100 more, I would buy it!), but the screen is good and gets the job done.  It has some interesting features like a built in ND filter, some interesting modes like HDR), some slightly unusual, but effective control dials, a neat plastic \"rim\" around the lens with a very grippable surface (can be removed), rotating eyelets for the strap, easy to read markings, decent menus, and so on.One thing I really like is the fast, snappy auto focus.  It's very \"crisp\" in operation, I never find myself waiting or hunting for a focus lock with this camera.  Very nice, I can tell you, and something not to be taken for granted (having used other fine cameras that did not, it can soon become very irritating when auto focus does not work well).It has the quite excellent Samsung Fn button menu feature - this is something I love about Samsung cameras, one of the best interfaces I've seen for making commonly needed adjustments easily and quickly -- and with class (nice visuals and feel using the dial on the front of the camera or the wheel on the back, hands down better than the competition in my opinion).The 12.4 megapixel sensor seems to be a good one.  IQ is good.  Noise is not an issue at normal ISO's (<800 or <1600).  This camera is a bit unique and it does take a bit of use to get used to it, but it's well worth it.  I always feel like I'm using a \"real camera\" when I'm shooting with the EX2, if you know what I mean.  It stands out from among the crowd in this highly competitive market segment (compacts around $300 are plentiful).  I wish the zoom were a bit longer, but I can live with it, and I am very happy to have the wide angle and great speed.  F1.4 is a treat and faster than anything else in this segment as far as I know.The WiFi features work well and the PC-AutobackUp is great for quickly and easily transferring photos to your PC or laptop after a quick shoot.  The SLB-10A battery is used by several other Samsung cameras, so I had a charger and a couple of spares on hand already, which was nice.  I have not used the video mode that much yet, but I did some tests and it seemed fine to me.  May come back and update later after I have more experience with it.  Another review mentioned the excellent sound quality of the built-in stereo mics and I can vouch for that.  I ran some tests and was very pleasantly surprised, the sound quality was maybe the best I have heard on a camera in this size and price range.  With the bright F1.4 lens and great mics, shooting music performances inside and getting decent results is a real possibility - shazam!Color and quality on both stills and video seemed good.  Need to do some more testing, but looking at my shots so far, I have been very pleased.  I often come back and update my reviews, so watch for more as I have more time with this fine camera.

The WiFi works...I sent a picture email and the Samsung website is pretty impressive.  The Samsung i-Launcher checked my firmware and says it is up-to-date.It was unusual to register a camera on a website that knows when the camera was made (after entering the serial number) and the date it was purchased...it would not register the camera until I checked the Amazon order and entered the correct date.  I entered today's date and it simply would not allow submission of the registration data.To be frank, I will probably just use the SMART mode 90 percent of the time.  The first two pictures turned out perfect in my opinion.I just made a movie of a grandson playing a Secret Worlds on his computer (after finally finding the video record button).

Seeing God's world through a camera lens. Recently took pictures of bees on cone flowers on macro setting, and a Church Baptism in the river from the shore. This camera lens does a wonderful job of capturing clear pictures to minute detail. I captured the eyes of bees, water on faces, in droplets and in streaming down as people came up out of the river! Amazing detail with wonderful clarity even when zooming up close to the subjects!I just can't figure out how to view pictures on the camera without encountering error messages, hopefully I can work out that detail.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera - Needs Better Connectivity", "Author": "John M.

But there are plenty of other cameras that can meet or beat it on IQ & ease of use, as well as max aperture (Panasonic LX7 comes to mind).I bought the EX2F for the built-in WiFi capability. It works pretty well but is too limited in functionality to allow me to give the camera 5 stars. I can upload to directly to Facebook, and back up directly to a computer. The other native apps are useless to me, and so far I don't see any way to delete them or replace them with something useful: Dropbox, Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter? Not happening.The display is good, as is the GUI - though it would be way easier if ISO were directly accessible through a button. The tilt screen is not useful and I'm going to ding Samsung a little for adding it.What I'm looking for (as of December 2012) is a mid-range capable point & shoot like this one, running Android. Do away with the hard buttons, and use all the real estate on the back for a decent-sized touch screen.
