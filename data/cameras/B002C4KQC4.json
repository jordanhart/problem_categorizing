I already own another camera made by the same company called the \"Mole,\" and assumed that this would be similar.  The mole is a very good looking camera and produces sharp images.This camera is quite ugly and produced very blurry images.  Even worse, there's some text at the top of the video image (that shows the date, time, and framrate) and the text is constantly updating (i.e., changing the frame rate from 30.1 to 30.2 and back).  Whenever that happens the entire bar flashes and it is very annoying.  I'm sending this one back to Amazon.com.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002C4KQC4"}}
