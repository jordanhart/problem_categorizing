This is a good first digital camera for kids. It's perfect for them to have on family vacations and get togethers. The best thing is the rubbery plastic shell. I don't see any problem when this camera gets dropped or is stuffed in the luggage. It can take a beating. The price is just right. The down sides are the confusing modes, the window for the modes is small (but I'll take that over a lager window that can break), and the subject that the photographer is taking, has to be very well lit, standing very still, and about two to four feet away from the camera. Loading the pictures to the computer is very easy. For my seven year old, this is the purfect camera. Dispite the down sides, (I'd expect that with a kid's camera) I'd recomend this one for any kid who wants a camera!", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Digital camera", "Author": "Tiffany", "ReviewID": "R14BF8MJTQPWLD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It doesn't hold a lot of pictures and if you run out of battery power, you lose the pics you took. I got this for my son's first camera, waste of money he didn't enjoy it at all.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awful Waste of Money", "Author": "MTPsychMajor", "ReviewID": "R1HN32MY8IQNGB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "They made this camera sound so perfect for a small child looking for his or her 1st camera - but my 9 year old was so disappointed with this product. When the battery dies, the pictures get deleted and the controls are not suited to a young child. It is difficult to tell even when the camera is turned on or off. It is very small (too small for my sons hands) and the pictures are of a very poor quality. Save your money on this one!", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cute Camera", "Author": "jshearer", "ReviewID": "RFURHOOLXRTI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my granddaughter,She has a bad habit of leaving her things where they get sat on so hopefully she will not break this too soon is seems very durable.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$19.99", "Features": "1.3 Megapixels\n640 X 480 Pixels Medium Resolution Or 320 X 240 Low Resolution\n3-In-1 Mode: Digital Camera, Web Camera & Video Camera\nImage Sensor: 300K Pixel Cmos Color 24-Bit\nSensor F2.8\n1.3 megapixel resolution\nf2.8 aperture\nLCD menu on back of camera\n3-in-1 Mode: Digital Camera, Web Camera and Video Camera\nFile Formats: JPEG and AVI", "Name": "Cobra Digital Squeezable Kids Camera, Blue DC150-BL", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eS7xeMiWL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000P6R3DQ"}}
