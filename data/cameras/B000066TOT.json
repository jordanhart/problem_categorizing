I've never used the Kodak software, I use a memory card reader, it's faster and doesn't use the camera batteries or rely on an expensive camera dock to transfer images to the PC. I certainly wouldn't have bought it without reading what type of memory card is uses, which ARE, ...., available from many 3rd party manufacturers and they're only moderately more expensive than other types of cards. All non-SLR digital cameras have a delay in between pressing the shutter button and the taking of the picture, the delay of this camera is no better or worse (around 1 second) than any other.The few drawbacks/complaints I have about the camera are;Flimsy doors, especially the door over the memory card slot, itfeels as if it could be easily broken if special care is not takenwhen removing or reinserting the memory card.Plastic camera body, while my AE-1 has been flung off cliffsand sunk in rapids I fear that a drop from almost any heightwould cause significant damage to this camera.Poor placement of the 'camera ready/camera status' light. It'sright next to the optical viewfinder and can interfere with takingpictures in low light situations because of it's brightness.Slow shutter speed of 1/8th sec. isn't very slow. A full secondwould have been a nice addition.All in all this is a great camera for the price, it takes goodpictures, comes with decent features and is almost completelyidiot proof. It's not a professional camera but great for someonewho's interest in getting started with digital photography andsmall enough to take with you anytime (I don't leave the housewithout mine.)", "Date": "March 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Easy to use camera", "Author": "John \"nissanman\"", "ReviewID": "R1XL0IGRTEV5EP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with the easy share dock.  It is so easy to use and good quality pictures.  With the software any poor pictures can be corrected.  I had a Sony digital camera which was much harder to use.  This camera with the dock is made for the novice user.  I have windows ME and I ran the CD software and was downloading pictures within 5 minutes with one button to push.  Love it and will use the heck out of it.  Would advise anyone to get this and the dock.  For the money, the camera takes good pictures and with extra memory can hold lots of pictures.  I have 64 memory which holds 72 pictures plus the internal memory can hold 23 I believe.", "Date": "January 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "S. Bowling", "ReviewID": "R1VC03EKVOTZ5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera - I've always been a technofan, but a thrifty one, so I waited a few years to get a little more for my money on a digital camera. Man, was it worth the wait!This camera is very easy to use, and takes great pictures. The menu system is easy to navigate, and pretty intuitive. My only complaint about the menu system is that some of my settings (such as 'close up mode') aren't saved when I turn off the camera, so I have to remember to re-enable the mode when I want to use it (thus far, most of my pictures have been for auction listings, so I've needed to take lots of closeups).This camera takes VERY high quality pictures.  With the 'good, better, and best' modes, I've found that 'good' works well for things like pictures embedded in online auctions, and 'best' gives me pictures that are at least as good as anything my 35mm camera produces.I also purchased a 256MB SD memory card, so I basically never have to worry about running out of film or memory.An unanticipated benefit of buying this camera is that I no longer have to worry when my young son begs to let him take pictures (worrying about the cost of 'wasted' film, development costs, etc).  If he takes a good picture, we keep it - if not, we delete it!If you're a professional photographer needing some new equipment for your next big photo shoot, this probably isn't the camera for you.  If you want a camera with a decent zoom that will let you take hassle-free vacation shots, family shots, and other general-purpose photography, this is a great camera.I would NOT invest in the optional camera dock. Even without it, all you need to do is plug your camera into a USB port and then turn the camera on - the software automatically starts, and with only one or two clicks you can download all of your pics from the camera to the PC, and delete them from the camera.", "Date": "June 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Docking Station Blues", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2DCHP9Y4SAK38", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received this camera for Christmas. The software loaded easily to both my Win2000 and WinXP computers so I have no idea why prior reviewers had problems. It takes decent pictures and is very easy to use. There is a delay when you click the button until the picture is taken... I miss a lot of spontaneous shots that way. My biggest beef is the battery charger. Mine did not come with a docking station and I was given a traveling battery charger. Much to my dismay, the lithium batteries that came with the camera do not fit the charger and the NiCad batteries that came with the charger last only a fraction of the time as the lithium. I found that the only way you can charge the lithium batteries is to buy the docking station ...!

(I bought the Kodak charger and 4 battery pack and still haven't used it) We are waiting for the end results from Ofoto so I hope I haven't jinxed myself, but all the pictures look great on screen. Speaking of uploads, the software is very easy to install (WIN2000) and use. No need to spend the money on the docking cradle because you still do it with a push of the button within the software. Best feature: video out for slide shows on TV. Feature not avail: movie mode, but that's what video cameras are for.

I usually print up to 8\" x 10\" with excellent results. With the right paper and injets the colors are so vibrant and beautiful and the picture quality is superb. It's very easy to use and I love the \"EasyShare\" software that comes with it. This camera allows you to view your photographs on your computer or on your televison. How cool is that? That's a great feature you'll want to use in case you go on a trip. That way, you can have fun, create your own slide show and share your photos with your friends and family.

We love the camera and use it often.  The software that comes with it is slick and easy to use and makes picture organization a snap. Just for fun I timed how long it took for us to take pictures of our daughter, load them in the computer from the camera, reduce the size of the image (I take my pictures at the highest quality and reduce the image size in MS Paint by 50%.  File size goes from more than 600KB to usually around 60KB to 80KB) and send them in an email.  Less than 5 minutes.  Talk about happy grandparents! We are separated by over 800 miles so to get near real time baby updates can't be beatThe one any major draw back to the camera is the slow picture speed.

After reading some of the more recent reviews I just wanted to touch on some subjects:Battery Life - Using 2300 mAh Ni-MH I can take over 70 top quality images, at least half with the flash on, on two batteries. During the hurricanes of 2004 that hit Florida I purchased a Lithium Ion battery cell for the camera and it's STILL in the camera and working perfectly!Image Quality - I'm a digital artist and know image artifacting and the differences between poor quality images and images worth printing. I've printed over a dozen 8x10s over the last two years and they've all come out beautiful. 4x6 prints that are well exposed are indistinguishable from 35mm prints.Imaging Speed - Yes, this, and every other point and shoot digital camera, has a slow recycle speed, some newer camera may be marginally faster but for something two years old this works as well if not better than any on the market at the time.In conclusion: BUY this camera if you can find one. It takes great pictures, it does NOT eat batteries as others have claimed and you can get some very nice archival prints from it. For the money I spent two years ago I couldn't be happier.Please see my review from two years ago further down the list for more information on the Kodak CX4230.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "What a camera!!", "Author": "P.

A friend picked up this Kodak for $10 at a local Goodwill store just to tinker with. As a photography hobbyist they figured for $10 if it's TERRIBLE we can just toss it in the trash. Keep in mind they purchased this camera from the Goodwill store in the summer of 2007.

I found some old pictures I'd taken with it which I will be uploading onto Amazon to share with others. I've tinkered with around a hundred digital cameras over the past 10 years from SLR's to camera phones and prefer to stick with point-and-shoot's.

I have an earlier model Kodak digital camera (3400) and couldn't be happier with it. It is very responsive and the prints are incredible. When I saw the 4230 used two fewer batteries and had a smaller form factor, I thought it would make the perfect present for my wife. Unfortunately when trying to take pictures of our kids, the delay between pushing the button and the actual capture often leave us with less than optimal results. The camera is a nice camera and the other functions work well.

The small lightweight body means I can throw it in my cargo pocket or flak vest and go. I have taken it to dusty conditions, dark conditions and everything in between and it has performed. The one drawback is the slow shutter speed and the delay between the time you press down on the button and the time it takes the photo. This is something that you have to get used to on the camera. I dont have a memory card but I set my quality to good to allow the internal memory card to take 68 photos and they have been really good. The software is easy to use and for users of XP unnecessary cause XP will read direct from the camera without the software being loaded.

At first I thought it was great.  The colors were wonderful and the camera was easy to use.  But after nearly a year of use, I'm beginning to change my mind.I have the camera dock, but have it hooked up to only one of my computers.  I've tried interfacing the camera with my laptop just through the USB cable and can never get it to work.  The software simply says it cannot detect the camera.  I've had similar issues using the dock, but eventually get it to work (I have Win 98).The dock also seems to have problems charging the battery.  It says the battery is fully charged, yet when I go to use the camera, it flashes the low battery symbol and shuts off.  I've resorted to using regular alkaline batteries, but of course that's a more expensive option.And the most annoying issue so far is that when I shut the camera off, the lens cover does not close.  The lens retracts and the camera shuts off, but the cover stays open.  Today I had to turn the camera on and off about 15 times before the lens cover closed.  Now I'm afraid to turn the camera back on.Also, under flourescent lights, this camera gets colors all wrong.", "Date": "November 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "I am sure there are better cameras out in this $$ range", "Author": "Robert A.

Also I can't stand the horrible delay in start up and shutter lag, this thing takes for ever to take a picture. I do have the docking station which is great for transfering pictures to your computer; however, it is unreliable for charging.
