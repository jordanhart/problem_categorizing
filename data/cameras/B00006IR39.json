{"Reviews": [{"Title": "FinePix 2650 - a very modern camera", "Author": "Lubos Motl", "ReviewID": "R23VK6FZTBL2IM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fuji FinePix 2650 is my third digital camera. The first one was KB JamCam (that is sold for [$$$] today) and the second one was Kyocera KZ (that I bought for [$$$] or so). Although I had to pay slightly more this time, the improvement is obvious.The pictures are crisp and sharp with colors that are smooth and bright. Unlike the previous cameras, I do not need to adjust the brightness or the contrast of each picture using photoshop software. They look beautiful as soon as I upload them into my computer (and even on the camera's LCD display). The flash does not \"wash out\" the faces; the pictures taken at night look fine, too. The camera has automatic detection of the lighting and also a manual mode that allows one to adjust the \"weather\" and other parameters. There are also several settings for the flash (on/off/auto/red-eye-remove/night-scene).Fuji did a great job with power conservation. Two alkaline AA batteries (included) were sufficient to take about 150 pictures (including 50 shots with flash) and several short videos before the \"battery low\" icon appeared. The power saving features are better than they used to be even though the lens is moving constantly especially when the camera is turned off and on. This motion looks sexy and the sliding cover protecting lens is useful. Aside from the power switch attached on spring, trigger and the switch between three modes stillpix/view/video, the camera is controlled by three buttons next to display - which I would call \"display on/off/grid\", \"enter\" and \"escape\" - and four arrow keys to browse the menus on the LCD display. The up/down arrow key is put on the same button which is also used to zoom in/out. FinePix 2650 can zoom up to 3 times optically (which is the case that keeps the maximal resolution) and the LCD display shows where the digital zoom - up to 2.5 times - takes over. FinePix 2650 has furthermore the 3-position trigger with the AF/AE lock that allows one to focus on the object which won't be in the center of the picture at the end.The totally new feature of FinePix 2650 - compared to its predecessor 2600 - is its tiny and cute Fuji XD memory card. The default 16 MB card (included) can be replaced by cards with up to 128 MB (the biggest one costs about 70 dollars). I am afraid that it is such a big memory that the (alkaline) batteries would be gone before I could fill the memory. With 16 MB I can take about 45 pictures at my favorite 1280 x 960 resolution, about 30 pictures at the maximal resolution 1600 x 1200, or about 130 small 640 x 480 images.The camera has the logo \"designed for Windows XP\" (which is my OS) and it works without any problems (I believe it also works with all older systems). FinePix 2650 immediately connects to the PC as a \"removable disk FinePix E:\" in my case. The package contains a manual as well as some extra new photoshop software. The camera can be also connected as a PC camera for videoconferencing.Generally the videos from FinePix 2650 are sharper than those made with Logitech QuickCam, for example, however I am not satisfied with the behavior of videos in darker environments. The videos (and probably also the image from the \"webcam 2650\") are too dim and I found even QuickCam better in these situations. The camera also does not focus very well in the dark which makes the pictures a bit fuzzy especially if the flash is not used. There is a lot of space for improvement. However, night video is not the main reason why I bought this camera and therefore I can unequivocably recommend this camera.", "Date": "September 25, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent in most respects", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R39U5XQV2JRTLS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Fuji FinePix 2650 is an excellent choice for an economical digital camera.  For inside shots, it excels at portraits of two or three people but the flash has difficulty illuminating groups as small as half a dozen people.  Outside, using natural lighting,I have produced landscape photographs that are breathtaking in their sharpness and true color.  Even tricky light settings, such as snow cover, produced pictures that would make a professional proud. The 2 Megapixel photos look good even when printed as 8 x 10's.  However, if you like to crop pictures using photo software, you are somewhat limited in what you can achieve without loosing resolution.I am very satisfied with battery life (especially if you avoid using the LCD to compose pictures).  If you are so inclined, a variety of manual settings are available through the LCD display, which are not difficult to master.  However, in bright sunlight, the LCD display is difficult if not impossible to read.  Used with a tripod, the manual settings provide good opportunities to be creative although the options do not directly simulate the controls of a SLR camera - that requires significantly greater investment in a digital camera.The lens cover of this remarkably compact camera has a tendency to partially close while composing shots until you figure out the best way to grasp the camera - not a big concern except for the ham fisted.  The FinePix Viewer software works well for downloading pictures to the computer but I prefer Photoshop for editing pictures.  Many pictures should be \"auto level adjusted\" with photosoftware to get the best color and brightness, but this is easy to do and is probably required for photos from many kinds of digital cameras.For the money, this is close to a 5 star camera; however, for those wanting more control over aperature, shutter speed, and \"film\" speed, a more expensive camera will be required.", "Date": "December 4, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Michael E. Shake \"mshake\"", "ReviewID": "RPPWMYSENNV1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Fuji finepix 2650 is a great camera for the price.You will be hard pressed to find another camera with 3x OPTICAL zoom and a video mode for that price. The detail at 2 megapixels is tremendous. You dont need more then 2 megapixels unless your a serious photographer. Two megapixels will print out an 8x10 photo with good quality.You are able ,in the macro mode, to zoom in for fantastic detailed images. Its no exageration to say you can see the pores in your skin in the Macro mode better then if you were looking in the mirror. You can zoom in on an eye and it will fill your video monitor when loaded to the pc.  It is very easy to use and the 16 megabyte card included is plenty for most people. Just plug the camera in using the included USB connection and they will load up automatically. From there you can use any software to enlarge ,crop or edit in the manner you choice.Having not owned a digital camera prior to this one its hard to compare battery life however they seem to last plenty long enough for me. I purchased 4 rechargable batteries and a charger so I should not have a problem in that area. The new XD card is supposed to use less battery life then the older style sorage cards.Only dissapointment would be in the video format. It does not do well in low light situations. If your indoors you will need bright light to get a decent video clip, outdoors in the sun its fine. Hint, you can use windows movie maker which is included with windows XP to join your clips and it also resaves your clip in the WMV format which compresses the video considerably for a much smaller file size with little video quality loss. This is ideal for e-mailing the clips.I highly recomend this camera for anyone who loves to take pictures, beginners to pros.", "Date": "December 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "Best in this Price Range", "Author": "\"alaskaklondikekid\"", "ReviewID": "R39P1NTSZWILO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the webmaster of one of Alaska's most popular websites (Alaska Outdoor Journal) I finally decided to bite the bullet and move from scanning film photo prints to going digital for my website photo support. It was a move long overdue but with the rapidly advancing technology it was hard to pick a point in time to BUY (like computers). That has occurred with my purchase of the 2650 after a considerable amount of comparison shopping. The sole reason for getting the 2650 was for my website support and so I was definitely looking for the best Price vs Features for under my $200 limit. I had decided that 2 megapixels was minimal resolution (1600x1200) to work with and that a very good Macro feature was a must have necessity.  I also wanted a true optical zoom in addition to a digital zoom. Lastly, I wanted at least some minimal Manual overrides on some of the settings for giving me some creative flexibility and artistic latitude. That?s a pretty tall order of features in this price range.Most digital cameras under $200 rarely have an optical zoom so that feature eliminated many brands and models. The FinePix is 3x optical and 2x digital. The macro feature exceeded my expectations...focusing sharp as a tack at 3.9 inches from the subject. With the manual override of the White Balance set for incandescent bulb, I took perfect color-balanced pics of close subjects. Although the minimal f stop is 3.5, I took several photos in a darkened Safeway parking lot with no flash and was impressed with its low light ability down to 1/2 second exposure if you brace the camera or use a tripod. There is also an exposure compensation (EV) override which will allow you to adjust your exposure when the subject is in a bright backlit situation or the backdrop you want to shoot is darker than the foreground. The on-camera menu is VERY easy to use and remember what does what. I commend Fuji for this simple approach. The LCD was very sharp and clear with excellent color quality. The camera uses the latest technology memory chip, the xD Picture Card which is a variant of the SmartMedia technology and apparently this chip uses much less energy and will help conserve battery life. I believe a lot of cameras will be going to this energy saver chip in the near future. The 16mb card that comes with the camera stores 25 highest quality pics down to 122 photos at 640x480 for webpage quality which remains totally impressive. I bought an additional 64mb card which will store 4 times more than the 16mb. I?ll never run out of space for pics.  So far the camera appears to be very energy friendly on the Ni MH rechargeable batteries I installed. Ni MH rechargeables are highly recommended...check out the Rayovac ONE hour charger PS4-B which now comes with two power cables...one for wall socket and the other a cigarette lighter plug cable to charge your batteries on the road in your vehicle in one hour. No better value. Go with the Kodak 1850 maH high capacity rechargeable AA Ni MH for longest run time. The software and camera is MAC and WinPC compatible using the USB port for connecting. The software automatically boots up when the computer senses the camera connection and power on. The program provides minimal editing control of the picture however. You can crop and resize but there is no brightness, color, saturation, etc. to adjust. Most users will have another graphics program they use to do these things anyway, like Photo Shop. You can run a slide show to review the entire camera contents or view pics individually. All the shot details are listed for each pic...f stop, shutter speed, date, time, file quality, etc. There is also a second program that is used to assemble a Photo Gallery collection to burn to CD or DVD and distribute to friends and family. You can also use this program to assemble a video clip gallery to burn to CD or DVD that you have taken with the FinePix 2650. These are pretty low res quality videos at 10 frames per second but you might have fun playing with this feature.In the under $200 range I would rate this 5 stars.  In the 2 megapixel range I would rate this 4 stars. There is a camera that impressed me even more in the 2mp range, the Canon A40 which I compared side by side last night, but its running in the mid-$200 range on Amazon. My friend has it and the software has many additional features and capabilities and the camera is loaded with additional cool onboard things like 15 second time exposure, sepia and b&w; settings, etc. and is Mac/PC compatible too.  BUT, for the best 2 megapixel entry level camera under $200 I would suggest the Fujifilm FinePix 2650; its a solidly built and very sturdy little camera. My only regret is Amazon dropped the price the day after I bought mine. Its a steal now at the new price.Good shooting, -KK-", "Date": "December 12, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price -  create sliceshows on VCD", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2KHOT0ZDW0VWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought it from amazon.com at a price of [money] dollars, free S/H and a free 32M XD card.There are some minor disadvantages: poor movies & LCD in low light condition, but it's not primarily for movies & he view finder can be used in the low light condition instead of the LCD.There are lots of advantages:- great price for a camera w/ 2MP, 3x optical zoom- xd card uses less batteries- great, sharp pictures- macro mode for close up pictures- easy to use menu- SOFTWARE (Imagemixer) TO CREATE SLICESHOW VCD DISK and you can play it on your DVD player.

They've taken a few cost-cutting measures, including shrinking the LCD a bit and excluding some things from the bundled accessories (namely, rechargeable batteries and a charger - you MUST get some NiMH batteries if you own a digital camera).However, these changes also made the camera lighter and more power-efficient.  The new xD card format does have some advantages over the old SmartMedia cards (faster write speeds, higher capacity, smaller, less power consumption), although these advantages are not as useful in a 2MP camera as they would be in a higher-end model.  Additionally, the price has been lowered as well.Therefore, this camera is still an excellent value in this class.  2MP is definitely enough resolution for most people and the picture quality delivered by the 2650 is very good.  The 3x optical zoom lens is a nice feature at this price point.  It's a great camera for people who are new to digital, since it has automatic modes which make it a pretty foolproof point-and-shoot (only very low light situations give it trouble).  It does have some manual adjustments available, but they're pretty limited.If you want very high resolution or total manual control, look elsewhere, but the average consumer will be totally happy with this camera.

I once went to mexico and took a picture of a famous place, i also had the same picture in a travel book.  When i came home and printed it out on my hp printer, it was picture quality, flawless.It does however have a tough time with movement.  I mostly take picture of pet fish, and they do not move that fast, but i find it very hard.  I find myself tweeking each little ajustment to get it just right, and I CAN get a good picture, but it does take a good deal of work to acheaive it.  It has a lot of nice features for under 200$ now, and i would recomend it to anyone who likes to take still photographs.Note: Many people say the LCD screen is hard to see in the dark, which it is, but if you turn up the lcd brightness to its top setting it is ok.~hope this helps", "Date": "November 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "First Digital camera", "Author": "Francis T.

I would suggest resisting the urge to buy a larger picture card with the initial purchase of the camera.  I thought about it and am glad I didn't because the 16MB picture card that is included will hold 25 pictures at the highest resolution and 122 at the lowest.  Once you download to your computer you can erase the pictures individually or collectively from the card and go on taking pictures.  I would wait until you really find you need more picture capacity and instead spend that money on recharchable Ni-MH AA batteries.  I bought the Olympus batteries and they work fine.

The menus on the camera itself are very easy to use and navigate.8. Nice, sharp & well focused daytime pics.Here are some negatives,1. Too thick to put in any pocket, except maybe a big winter coat.2. Uses a propreitary and expensive xD card. This adds to cost and makes tougher to recommend it.3. Lens has very slow startup time and takes long to retract back. I feel its slower than even 2600.4. Poor low light performance.5. Mostly the white balance/ brightness is wrong, have to fiz each picture in Photoshop.6. There's no TV output on this, what a shame !7. The movies recorded don't have sound and are not so great8. Cheap and low resolution LCD screen.9. Fuji cut too many features compared to 2600 on this, smaller LCd size, no NiMH battery/charges included, slow startup times etc.10. Poor build quality. Last yr's 2600 failed due to many things like stuck lens and battery leaked charge. 2650 seems likely to have same troubles.Wish Fuji had made this thinner by about 0.7\", used a standard Compact Flash card instead of propreitary xD card, had a TV out, better white balance and quality control. My 2650 is going back to store. I had rather buy a Canon or Nikon.If you don't mind being stuck with a dead camera on a trip and don't mind above shortcomings its a good buy.

The 2650 is the same camera but with the new XD storage card. We're pretty impressed with the quality of the camera and the features. The 3x optical zoom is one of the better features. To get that kind of zoom on a camera in this price range is rare. If you're looking for a camera, don't fall victim to the \"digital zoom\". Some manufacturers advertise a 3x zoom, but its of the digital variety, not optical. All the digital zoom does is make the pixels bigger. Optical zooms are like those on traditional film cameras.There are two complaints we do have. The first is the battery life. It doesn't last very long when you're using the LCD as the viewer. To compensate you can use the manual viewfinder. Fortunately our camera came with the rechargeable batteries. The other problem we have seen is in the lens itself. It is not very high quality. On some pictures you can notice a little spherical curvature near the edges. Its not noticeable unless you have a straight line like a wall to use as a reference. But for a camera of this price, these quibbles are easily overlooked.The Fujifilm 2600 and 2650 are great values in the digicam arena. They make great cameras for those just getting into the hobby.

The quality is apparent from the first moment you see the box, when it becomes clear that Fuji put a lot of effort into designing this product. This camera also has several advantages over other brands at similar prices. The most obvious advantage is that this camera uses the new xD picture cards; and these little fellas are really neat. If you ever watched the original Star Trek, you know that Starfleet around that time stored its portable data on small cartridges. xD cards are like that but much, much smaller; sort of like a thumbnail size wafer, which you can slip in the coin pocket of your blue jeans; so small, that these xD cards are suitable for use by James Bond on one of his secret missions; and they are durable, too. When I shopped for other digital cameras, it became obvious that xD cards are the latest and finest technology, and they use much less power too (and that's important when you're dealing with a portable digi-cam). The other advantage of the 2650 is that unlike similarly-priced models, it has a digital AND 3x optical zoom. First I looked at an Olympus, a fine outfit, but for the same price I got this Fuji with the optical zoom; usually a feature only on the more expensive models. I'm happy also with the compatibility of the Fuji digital software with my Windows PC. Fuji has a marketing agreement with Microsoft (I'm a big supporter of MS, because I LIKE to be able to have all my software working together), and my dreaded installation of the included Finepix 3.2a software CD-ROM went very smoothly. After you install the included software, which is quite easy, it is really a cinch to download pictures. You simply connect the included USB cable to your camera port, and your PC and Fuji camera automatically take over; the Finepix Picture Viewer pops up on your screen, and you're in business. You don't even have to \"download\" your pictures, they automatically synch right into the PC viewer, and then you can simply select the ones you want to save to your hard drive (the Finepix software also works on Mac's for all you Apple geeks [get in touch with your dark side--try a PC.]). The operation of this Fuji 2650 camera is also elegant and efficient. Remember, this camera is relatively inexpensive for 2 megapixels & an optical zoom; but you sacrifice nothing in terms of performance. The user interface and menu is so intuitive I was using this camera before having read the instruction manual (I still have not read it, just a few paragraphs from the software installation section), and a \"QuickStart\" foldout guide comes with the instruction booklet, so I was taking pictures within minutes (The people at Fuji Japan are obviously very sharp). The LCD screen on the back of the camera is adequate, and doesn't seem to use up my batteries too quickly. I want to make a few suggestions to you if you're interested in buying this camera: First of all, go to the Fuji-USA website and you can take their interactive tour of the camera (this alone will sell you); when you buy this 2650 model, make sure you purchase a genuine Fuji 3V AC adapter (digi-cams can drain batteries away faster than politicians can find new ways to tax us) which is available from Fuji on their website (I hope Amazon.com decides to stock this item); also, I purchased the Fuji-brand accessory package for the 2650, which includes a very fine Panasonic recharger and set of 4 top-of-the-line Panasonic NIMH rechargeable batteries (better than NiCad), a mini-tripod, a genuine Fuji padded soft camera case (it's worth it just for the charger and batteries), and also a complimentary copy of Microsoft Picture It! 2002 Express (although all you really need is the excellent Fuji Finepix software). Now, I want to ask you, unless you're a professional photographer, why would you need something more expensive (and more complicated) than this Fuji 2650? I know I sound like some spokesman for Fuji, but I'm not (look me up on my Amazon profile). I simply appreciate it when a company designs a beautiful, integrated product and sells it at a great price. This is somewhat akin to choosing between a Toyota Camry and a Jaguar XJ-S; with the Jag, you will be paying 300% more for a car you have to endlessly worry about, take care of, and constantly repair and protect, not to mention learn how to use all the advanced gizmos; with the Toyota, you're buying a car which is fun, nicely designed, practical, and solidly built. My Fuji 2650 pictures are great, even at the lowest resolution. I bought this camera for a specific purpose (posting pictures on internet dating sites) and so far I am scoring with the great photos (and the ladies too:)--relax, I am just trying to amuse you); but this camera will do very well for you no matter your purpose. You don't need 6 Megapixels and a 10x optical zoom, take the $500 you save buying this camera and buy a good stock, or a present for your girlfriend or significant other.

I compared it to the Olympus and Canon same quality models, and the Fuji won hands down.  The Fuji, although slightly bulkier, is sturdier.  I accidently dropped it, to my horror, within a couple hours of opening it and it didn't phase the camera.  I did have to adjust the brightness level for the LCD screen to display pictures properly. But once I got it, the display is beautiful.  The pictures downloaded seamlessly to my computer and again, the quality is magnificent. However, I am a little upset that I have to buy an adapter to use my memory card with my printer.  I wish it was standardized.  I didn't know I was going to have to buy an adapter when I got my new photo-printer, but the Fuji xD memory card will not fit in the slot properly nor in most other photo printers unless there is an adaptor.  A very big inconvience and when you are trying to save money but later find you have to buy adapters to make peripherals work, the low price of the camera isn't so low anymore.  However, you can print from via computer to printer.  I just wanted the ease of printing from my camera to the printer.  The movie feature is just fun.  It's not professional and no audio.  But if you want a simple little video, it works fine.  The major drawback is that you can't use the flash when you are recording a video.  If you are recording a video in low-light, the quality is rather grainy. PROS:*Wonderful quality pictures*Easy to set-up*Sturdy camera*LCD displays pictures crisp and with good color*Nice features included (manual and auto modes, movie option)*Holds good amount of photos.*QUALITY OF PICTURES IS GREAT!Cons:*Wish there was the option to use the flash while using the movie feature (if there is an option, I haven't figured it out).*Goes through batteries.  The batteries included were used up in a matter of 2 hours.  I hope newer batteries last a bit longer.*Long delay (about 3-4 seconds) between pictures.  If you need to take shots in quick succession either find another camera or use the movie mode.*LCD doesn't display images in dim environments very well.  Once picture is taken and then viewed, it's much better.Overall, the quality of the photos makes this camera worthwhile, not to mention the ease of available functions.

The pictures were sharp and clear, and my family was thrilled.Apart from the modern styling of the unit, its logical design, its high quality construction and its ease of use, there are two other features that deserve special mention: the 3X optical zoom, and the powerful flash. This unit features a true optical zoom which allows you to capture detail that's just not possible with a digital zoom. Additionally, the powerful flash is good for about 10ft or more in low light conditions, and is more than adequate for your average living room.Transferring images to the PC is so simple, once you're using Windows XP, that I haven't even bothered to use the included software. I just connected the camera to my PC via the USB cable, let Windows install the device, and my photos were downloaded in about a minute.

The 2650 is only good for outdoor daylight posed shots or indoor posed shots within 8 feet due to a feeble flash and poor low light picture taking ability.2. The time delay between pushing the button and the shutter snap is so unacceptably slow that you will always miss the candid shot.3. The fixed ISO is set to ISO 100 which is too slow to stop any action.4. Forget about any low light picture taking.I have seen other digital cameras take clear night photos. There is no hope of doing that with this toy.5. The auto-focus seemed to work better when the camera was new but now it seems to have gotten slow and unpredictable and seems to frequently focus on things other than what is in the Autofocus frame.6. When taking consecutive pictures of the same subject in Auto mode, the shutter speeds inexplicably vary between 1/140 and 1/450 sec.  causing various degrees of blurriness .7. Red Eye reduction and all the other special settings do nothing. All these special features may sound cute but in reality are just nonfunctional gimmicks. It would be nice if Fuji would get serious and dispense with all this silly nonsense and just build in a faster ISO or variable ISO speed.8. The worst thing is that the logic chip has gone haywire causing the LCD display to be scrambled and unusable. Others have had this same problem and have stated Fuji can't seem to fix it.9.

I won't describe the pros and cons of this model as other reviewers have covered this ground already.  I used it for over 2 years with no problems, then the front lens became loose.  The reason for the failure was evident upon disassembly.  The outer barrel (the part that protrudes from the camera body) is held by three metal pins mounted on plastic tabs that are part of the lens barrel.  One side of one tab broke, releasing the pin holding that side of the barrel in place.  I suspect that the inner zoom lens barrel may have caught on the inside of the outer barrel, straining the tab and breaking it.  Ordinarily it would be a simple fix to switch the lens to a new outer barrel, but if the entire lens assembly is sold as a unit, the repair would probably cost more than a new camera.If all the moving parts were metal rather than plastic, the camera would probably last forever.  Then again, others have commented on the limited life of the viewscreen, so my suspicion is that the entire unit is only intended to last a short period (by which time it would be obsolete anyway).  Digital camera design is progressing so rapidly that no one should buy one without the intention of replacing it in a few years.  If you want a camera you can pass down to your grandchildren, film is still the way to go.I do need to comment on some of the other reviewers' observations:1.  The camera stops working - permanently - if you drop it or knock it off a table:  This issue isn't limited to this model - virtually every electronic device will break if dropped or handled roughly.  Many cell phones will take an incredible amount of abuse - if you want an indestructible camera, get a cell phone with a camera built-in.2.  The camera is too thick:  It's about the same size and shape as a 35 mm snapshot camera.  I suspect this is a problem only because much thinner digital cameras are now available - no one ever complained about this with the older film cameras.3.  The image in the viewfinder doesn't correspond exactly to the captured image:  Again, just like a film camera with a viewfinder.  Unless one is looking through the lens, parallax wil ensure that the viewed image differs from the final photograph.  Even SLR film cameras only show 90-95% of what the film sees in the viewfinder.Overall this camera was a great introduction to digital photography.", "Date": "February 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "It's a Bargain!", "Author": "mudpie1598 \"mudpie1598\"", "ReviewID": "R2OXQ6ZOEZQZDE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received this item as a Christmas gift last year and boy was I surprised!

It has 3X optical zoom and takes pictures at a 2.0 MEGA PIXELS.  Pretty low mega pixels. It comes with a hand strap, camera software, 16-MB picture card, USB-cable, picture/camera software (Windows XP/Win 98'), and comes with 2 Fuji AA-batteries which let's you start having fun once you open the box.  It has a 1.5 inch color LCD screen which let's you control the brightess of it, also it lets you pan a picture after you've taken it.  You can view 9-images simultaneously.  It has a one finger-touch easy to open lens cover and a one finger touch picture taking button. The \"MACRO\" feature is pretty awesome, you can zoom into your subject to take a close-up picture.My suggestions are this:  Buy rechargeable AA-batteries and a charger for this camera because since it requires only 2-AA-batteries it will eat them up quickly.  Also, it's a bit slow after taking a picture, meaning the recovery time is slow and you can't really take pictures one after the other quickly enough.  You have to have a steady hand in order to take a picture and your subject needs to also be in a steady position.  Moving objects don't photograph very well.  If you choose to do a manual flash or no flash at all be prepared to take a lot of blurry pictures no matter how steady your hand is.  I suggest leaving the camera on AUTO at all times.  It does take some really nice pictures though, proof of this is in the \"Customer Images\" at the top of this page.  Basically, you get what you pay for.  It's a camera built for vacation snap shots, not to build your creative/artistic picture library or to start your picture taking hobby, for this you'd need a higher MEGA PIXEL or SLR camera.

Therefore we relied on online reviews and such to help us find the right camera. In so doing we came upon the Fuji FinePix 2650.Here was a camera that didn't have a million different features, but seemed to have everything necessary to take a good picture. We were told by someone who knew quite a bit about digital cameras that having both a digital zoom and an optical zoom was a very good thing. We found that most cameras in our price range did not have this feature, but the Fuji did. There were just enough menu options for us to feel like we could do a range of things and take a variety of shots. It's light weight though a bit thick. And the quality of pictures that the Fuji took was very nice. Find the right printer and paper and it would rival professionally developed pictures.A few drawbacks to the camera--~As many other reviewers noted, digital cameras eat up batteries. We had only take about thirteen or fourteen shots when the low battery icon came on. The power saver mode kicks in pretty quickly when the camera is on, but that didn't seem to be enough to make the batteries last longer.~In an attempt to save some battery power, we thought we'd buy a memory card reader so that we didn't have to have the camera on in order to download the pictures onto my laptop. The problem with that was that because, as we were told, Fuji has a XD card none of the readers were compatible. Except for, that is, the one put out by Fuji, which was just too much money to actually purchase.~The camera comes with a 16 MB card, but we figured we'd get the 128 MB and not have to worry about how many pictures we took for some time. Now, the Fuji cards aren't cheap so we looked for a \"generic\" one that was a bit cheaper. A similar problem to the one above occurred. Fuji and Olympus seem to be the only manufacturers that produce the XD card right now. So we were stuck with the cost of the Fuji card.Overall, the camera was a wonderful purchase. If you want it simply to take on vacations and day trips and such you couldn't do any better. The price is right and it's fun to experiment with. One thing is that I'd recommend buying rechargeable batteries--We found an Energizer kit that charges in an hour, is small/thin enough to pack, and the batteries are cheaper than some. I think I can honestly say that, even if we had known about some of the things stated above beforehand, we still would have purchased the Fuji FinePix.", "Date": "June 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera at a Great Price", "Author": "illbenooneelse", "ReviewID": "R9F7W9HBA4ZN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having this camera for a month now, I really must concede to the fact that I couldn't be happier with it.Before purchasing the Fuji Finepix 2650, I looked into a seemly endless variety of other digital camera options. Yet from the beginning, my intentions, desires and constraints were very clear - Although I needed a camera that would perform well as a vessel for making high quality prints, what I really needed was an economically feasible camera that would excel in effectively providing me with photos for online posting. After looking into comparable models in Sony's Cybershot series, Nikon's Coolpix series, Cannon's Powershot Series and Kodak's EasyShare series, I discovered quite simply that the Finepix 2650 is a marvel of a fit for my distinct needs over all the rest.For this camera's price, you really cannot get a better deal. With a CCD rating 2.0 megapixels, you get incredible photo quality capable of displaying images at 1600 x 1200 resolution. For the great majority, this photo quality is more than enough for intermediate-to-advanced use. With regards to such intermediate-to-advanced use, compounded upon the camera's extremely versatile Automatic setting, a fully featured Manual setting is also offered. When assigned to Manual mode, the user is given the option to toggle white-balance settings for appropriate color saturation and hue, shutter speed for low-light photography and exposure compensation for effective light-intensity balance and color separation. The Finepix 2650 features 5 flash modes that include an automatic setting, forced flash, suppressed flash, red-eye reduction and a slow-synchro mode for nighttime/low-light scenarios. Available on both Automatic and Manual modes, is an excellent macro-mode that is used to take extremely detailed photos at lens distances as miniscule as 2 centimeters. After playing with the macro feature on a myriad of different subjects, I am completely astounded at the level of detail evident in each photo even at the low-quality settings. The last and slightly less impressive feature of the Finepix 2650 is it's ability to shoot full-motion video. On the plus side, video resolution is pretty good boasting the ability to record at a 320 x 240 VGA display. On the negative side, however, the exclusion of an internal microphone means that that there are no audio recording capabilities. A more practical use for this camera's video capturing option is that of a webcam. In fact, included in the bundled software package is a webcam/web-conferencing tool.This camera runs off of 2 alkaline or nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries. When compared to other cameras, the Finepix 2650 has a lower power usage rating that obviously translates into extended battery life. Albeit a slight advantage over other models, this camera still eats through batteries along with the best of them. I highly recommend picking up a set of rechargeable nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries with a power rating at least 1700Mah. One feature of the camera that no doubt contributes to this camera's lower power drain is it's exploitation of the xD media format. The latest in what seems to be a whole sea of memory cards, the FujiFilm/Olympus/Lexar proprietary xD Picture Card is known for it's low power drain. The xD Picture Card, barely the size of a penny, also features transfer and read/write speeds far greater than Panasonic's SD format or Sony's Memory Stick. Bundled with the Finepix 2650 is a 16Mb xD card which, in most cases, is somewhat adequate. However, most will find the need to upgrade to at least a 64Mb xD card.All in all, the Finepix 2650 is a great, feature-loaded camera that is available at an extremely reasonable price.

The batteries on older digital cameras were gross. About an hour off of four AA batteries. No more, folks. My cam works on 2 AA rechargable batteries for about 5 - 10 hours and then it only takes an hour tops to charge again. If you buy two pairs and charge both up before you leave then you're good to go!The zoom is wonderful. Unless you're going to be taking exceedingly long shots of something you won't need a further zoom. REMEMBER: 3x Optical Zoom, 2 or 3x Digital Zoom, and then on top of it all if you put it on the highest \"best\" quality, you get an image that's like 1600x1200 or something like that. I usually scale my pics when I save them to 800x600 (or whatever) just so I can fit them on my computer screen fully without cutting 1/2 of it off when trying to view it. Best of all if you take a pic with the highest setting and zoom all the way in with the optical zoom (the digital zoom is sort of [bad] but that's the same for all digi cams), take the pic, and then cut out what you'd like when you edit them on your computer. 800x600 is bigger than a regular sheet of paper printed on an ink jet, btw...The only *problem* I have with this cam at all is that the images without flash are a bit dim unless it's exceedingly light (I'm talking halogen light brightness). With the flash and with the image close enough you should have no problems. Due to the brightness fact and the Ineptitude of Windows XP the contrast/brightness controls all are not available...

The manufacturer's offering of 16Mb card + 2 alkaline batteries is woefully inadequate - I'd prefer it came with no card and save a few pennies. 32Mb is adequate; 64 is good.Realistically, it has to be used with rechargeable batteries - a charging circuit in the camera would be a good start.The software is abysmal - both Mac and PC. The Webcam mode is useless and not available for Mac (no mention of this on the manufacturer's site); the 'fine pix' photoeditor is slow and painful (tip for mac users, just plug it in, copy the files over and use iphoto or graphics converter) - again save some money and don't even bother with the CD. Also the Mac version refused to load until a lot of weird tricks were done.The xD cards are small and fast but are yet another standard which is incompatible with Smart Media, Sony Memory Stick, Compact Flash etc...

That said, there are a few issues to be aware of: - Manual controls are only available through the menu system.  They are simple to get to, but get turned off when the camera is turned off. - Barrel distortion can be an issue at its widest angle (the default), but zooming in on your subject a little will eliminate the problem. - The plastic construction gives it a \"cheap\" feel, but it is not flimsy and doesn't seem like it will fall apart - The boxy dimensions make the camera feel awkward at first.  With a little use, it became quite comfortable to use. - The viewfinder is not as accurate as the LCD.  It doesn't show some of the picture.  This can be especially annoying with group photos. You'll probably want to setup shots using the LCD most times, but this can be difficult in direct sun light. - The camera takes 2 AA batteries which will probably not last as long as your trip.  I recommend getting some re-chargeable NiMH batteries.  Target had a reasonably priced set of 4 with charger. - The included memory card is only good enough for about 20 of the highest quality pictures so you'll want to get a 128M xD card.Despite these limitations, I have been quite happy with this camera.

Sent it back, received it back 2 weeks later, and the camera is still broken.  Not good. Can have warranty for years, but if they cant fix it, bummer.The Good:  It takes excellent pictures and the compression on Fuji cameras are one of a kind. Meaning, you can usually take more pictures.  The built of the camera (other then the LCD) is really tough, even though I tested this (went rock climbing) after I received my camera back and it was still broken.Extra Notes:  The lens, when shutter is open, takes about 3-4 seconds to fully extend when power is on. Something the manual doesn't say.Now, I have bought another camera, but I keep the Fuji as a outdoor camera (rock climbing and sorts) since the LCD back screen is broken, and sounds like Fuji doesn't have a fix... yet.

Previous to this, I'd been a 35mm SLR shooter, but I needed a digital for online auction photos and this one, when I checked it out in stores, seemed to be able to focus down to about 4-5 inches, so I got one.The first one died within a few days and I had to take it back, but the replacement I've carried around and beaten and abused - the finish is worn off most of the case; the lens did break on one side and you have to be careful it's not crooked or it will give photos that are blurry on one side.  Sometimes the on-off needs to be flipped several times to make it come on, a couple of times had to open the battery compartment.  The flash is obviously set at one setting, which tends to be too bright for close up pictures, and too weak for low-light pictures at a distance or of large objects - the happy medium seems to be around 10-12 feet with some kind of lighting.  It's slow to shoot (auto anti-red-eye) when pressed and takes varying amounts of time to recharge depending on how weak the batteries are.  It tends to eat batteries fairly rapidly.  The shutter speeds are limited and control seems to be auto only, for instance on a cloudy, rainy day it needs the flash or it will set itself so slow you need a tripod for a clear shot.  At the same time taking pictures of say a passing car in bright light, it's too slow unless you turn and pan with the moving object (which has resulted in a few nice photos).  The lens cover is easy to bump over just a bit, which makes the lens retract.I have never used it for video, it's an extra feature I don't see a need for since unless you put a big memory card in it you can't shoot for very long.  If I were looking to shoot videos, I'd buy a camcorder of some sort.  The only reason I can think to try it is it may provide a means to beat some of the low light weaknesses of the photo side through the use of still frames out of the videos.But it's done it's job, I've taken literally thousands of pictures with it and it's paid for itself more times over than I could stop to count.

The layout of the camera is simple. You just probably just take it out of the box and start using it without the manual (that's what I did). Switch from the camera view to the view pictures screen to the camera view instantly by just moving a dial. They're even labeled well! Camera view is a camera, the picture viewer is a Play button icon, and the video view is a video recorder picture. It doesn't take a lot of thought to tell which one is which. The image quality is good. It works for me. Some people aren't fond of it, though. But if you're someone who doesn't need huge, perfect, crisp photos every time, like me and most of us, this is the camera. The quality lowers a bit when pictures are taken in very dark areas, but still turn out. The most pictures you can take is about 130, the dimentions about 800 x 600 (it could be 1024 x 768, I'm not quite sure), the smallest dimentions. You take take HUGE ones, but you are limited to about 15 of them. The # you can take depend on the battery juice and the amount of pictures and their quality already token. Battery juice is the only drawback. It drains them in about 2-4 hours. ALWAYS bring extra.It does take a little while for the camera to load and prepare for a picture after you've already taken one. It depends on the setting of No Flash, Flash, No Red Eye, or Auto.In conclusion, if you aren't some magazine photographer and just want it for personal, family, or web site use, this is the perfect camera.

If you take a picture in a half-lit room, it still brings great lighting and clarity to the picture as the auto flash lights it up. I would say that there are only two drawbacks to the entire camera: 1.) The lighting in one room at my house wasn't the best. I couldn't see through the screen (I could through the viewfinder, just not the digital screen) what I was taking a picture of. The picture still came out great, but it would have been nice to see what I was photographing.  2.)

A friend of mine purchased a 4 MP camera (twice the MP) for twice the price - and my photos *always* turn out ten times better than hers. She tries all different settings, but she always gets the same grainy results. Not so with the Finepix. I recently tested the zoom ability by taking the Finepix to a baseball game. We had seats in the very back of the stadium, yet I managed to get a closeup shot of the first base area that was crisp and clear! All that with just 3x Optical zoom!My only complaint about this camera is the webcam option. I've never been able to get this option to work properly - the images are so black and dark you can't make out any images unless you have a direct spotlight on them, and then the coloring is very red. I downloaded all the right drivers, same problem. I wrote to the tech support of Fujifilm digicams, and they've never responded.

It took a little while to figure out the correct settings to use (but since there is no film to waste and no development waiting time that's a breeze), but once that was determined, the results are fantastic.

The 2650 blows away my Canon Elan IIe for consistantly good color balance and overall image quality.Is it the perfect digital camera?  No, but it's about the best you'll find in this price range and even among those costing a couple of hundred more.  It's packed with features and I've experienced zero problems in the 4 months I've owned it.Pros:*Great overall image quality*Small but not too small*Good selection of picture modes*Accurate focus*MP3 movies (no sound)*XD picture card*Good battery lifeCons:*Menu (you have to surf to find what your looking for and memorize the symbols since it doesn't give text descriptions)*Somewhat slow shutter speed (set to the equivalent of 100 asa 35mm film)*Crummy, ad-filled software (if you have XP don't even bother installing it)After experimenting with several of the modes available, I'm happy to leave it in full-auto which gives great reults for 98% of my shots, indoor and out.  I haven't even used my SLR since buying the Fuji.  The zoom lense is adequate except for extreme long range shots (but how many people own 500mm lenses for their SLRs anyway?)  For anyone who complains about weak flash - the flash is as good as any in a small camera, it won't illuminate a stadium, but it's not meant to.  Last but not least, the XD picture card.  Yes it's proprietary and currently only Fuji and Olympus use it.  It's extremely fast, amazingly small, works well and is not over-priced compared to other media.  I dare-say anyone who has a complaint about proprietary issues hasn't changed an ink cartidge in their printer and probably still uses floppy-discs for their primary data storage.

We've been waiting until prices came down enough that we could afford a digital camera that would have comparable print quality to a film camera.  We got the Fuji FinePix 2650 here at Amazon.com with a bonus 32MB memory card and free shipping, and we're really impressed with it.  The Fuji camera is just as small as the ELPH (though a bit thicker, probably due to the LCD screen).  Installing the software and hardware drivers to our Windows XP machine couldn't have been any easier, and uploading the pictures is as simple as plugging one end of the USB cable into the camera and plugging the other end into the PC---turn on the camera and the software starts automatically, loading thumbnails of all your pictures.  My husband was particularly interested in how well the camera would work in macro (ultra close-up) mode; you can't get any closer than about 4\" from the subject, but if you need to zoom even bigger you can do that on the PC after uploading the picture.  I had the camera set for highest resolution, optical zoom, macro mode, and I was able to zoom in to about 300% on the uploaded picture before I noticed any deterioration in the image.  Because we were also concerned about getting picture quality that would be comparable to our ELPH, I did a test by taking a picture of our baby at a distance of about 2 feet, then I uploaded the picture to the PC and zoomed in on the baby's face to fill an entire 8 1/2 x 11\" sheet; on our color inkjet, using normal paper, the picture quality was excellent.  The picture came out clear and crisp, and our more typical 4x6 prints should be even better---I'll bet that if I print them on photo paper they'll be indistinguishable from regular photos.  I tested the camera indoors in low light, indoors in medium light, and outdoors in sunlight, and the pictures came out great in all three settings.  The LCD screen doesn't work in low light conditions, but there's a regular viewfinder too so I just used that and then looked at the picture after it was taken.  I really like being able to immediately see whether or not the picture came out, and being able to immediately delete it if I'm not happy with it.  You can even zoom in on the stored image in the LCD viewfinder of the camera to confirm that the picture is totally in focus before deciding to keep it or delete it.  No more paying to develop bad pictures!!  The 32MB card holds 50 pictures on the highest resolution setting, and the camera comes with a 16MB card that holds 25 pictures at the highest resolution setting.  These cards are a little bigger than a penny and can be stored (with pictures on them) outside of the camera until you're ready to upload to the PC.  So when one card gets full, we'll just pop in the other one.  And of course, the cards can be erased and re-used over and over again, so I doubt we'll ever need to buy any more memory for this camera.  Even on vacation, I doubt we took 75 photos that were 'keepers'.  The camera also has a full-motion video feature, and it can be used as a webcam too.  I doubt we'll use the full-motion video since we already have a digital videocam, but the webcam feature will be handy for those cyber-visits with distant relations.At a [low cost], this camera will pay for itself in film, developing and photo discs within about 6 months in our home (we have kids, so we take a lot of pictures).

However for anyone with any desire to tweak settings you should definitely not get this. Other 2MP camera's such as Canon A40 have lots of creative options not found here, including adjustable ISO speed. This will add visible noise above 100, but it is possible to get low light shots not thinkable with this camera. Also the maximum . 1/2 sec. shutter interval does not help in this respect. As someone mentioned, the white balance tends to be off a bit. Here are some additional ideas of mine relating to this product and the fact that it only uses xD memory(which by the way, as of this, costs twice the price of CompactFlash or Smartmedia and by the time you buy a good amount of memory you will have spent as much as a better canon or something with the same amount of memory): I could not agree more on the issue brought up here. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus (w/Memstick). Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD.

I checked reviews online on CNET and Amazon.com - it had very nice user comments. So I decided to give it a test. After I took several pictures (which I do every day with other cameras) there was no question left - this camera can't focus. First after the camera identifies the object it remembers its location, puts itself in a sleep mode for about a second or two (which is a lot) so it can actually establish the focus, and after the focus has been established it actually snaps the picture. And as a result - during those one-two seconds being in a sleep mode either your hand can move just a little bit, the object itself can move, or anything else around the object (like a car on a background, or a pedestrian somewhere on a side) which causes the camera to loose it's focus immediately.
