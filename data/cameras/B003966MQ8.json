{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great performance and reasonable price", "Author": "R. L. Waters", "ReviewID": "R3E7YN74T4B6QL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a long time contemplating buying the ZS3 I finally decided to wait and see what Panasonic would have for us in the 2010 line up. And so far I'm very glad I waited.The ZS1 and ZS3 were Panasonic's high zoom compact cameras last year, and both of them receive great reviews. I've had a chance on several occasions to play with 2 different ZS3's that belong to friends, and this was initially the camera I was going to get being very impressed with it's performance. However, by the time I was ready to buy, the new ZS5 and ZS7 (to replace ZS1 and ZS3 respectively) were on the markets. And to my surprise, the ZS5 with several upgraded features was significantly cheaper than it's predecessors.A few things I noticed right away comparing my new ZS5 to my friend's ZS3:-First, physically the ZS5 has a smaller screen than the ZS3. The screen however is still sharp and clear, and perfectly usable. After a few minutes I don't even notice the difference.-The ZS5 can zoom while recording a movie, something that my friends ZS3 can not do.-The ZS5 image stabilization is just amazing, and seems to be much better than the ZS3. Especially noticeable at the higher zooms while recording video.-The ZS5 now has manual controls, something the ZS3 does not have. For me, even as a complete amateur, this is a huge benefit, and the single largest upgrade over the ZS3.-The ZS5 has a one touch zoom button on the back in addition to the normal zoom control on top. This button with one press takes you from zoomed out, to full optical zoom, then full digital zoom, then returns to zoomed out. Not a big feature but something I can see being handy from time to time.-The ZS5 no longer has the dedicated movie record button on the back, but rather an option on the selection dial on the top, similar to other cameras I have used, and what I personally prefer.-The ZS5 has an exposure button on the back. While in manual modes pressing this button activates the directional buttons below it to act as the adjustments to your various manual settings. I think this is a clean and easy way to get control over settings and better than other setups I've seen in compact digitals with manual settings, where you often have to navigate menus to find the settings.-Overall the ZS5 construction feels very solid, the lens action is smooth and quite, and the buttons have the high quality feel, just like the ZS3. Perhaps the main difference being the ZS5 has a slightly stiffer mode selection wheel, while the ZS3 mode selection wheel would often be moved just by removing it from your pocket.Now to compare the ZS5 to it's bigger brother the ZS7.From my research (not experience) the main differences are the 7 has the larger screen, on board GPS, and a slightly different image processor. For me, these first two differences actually benefit the 5 over the 7, giving it longer battery life simply because it doesn't use power on the GPS or the larger screen. The image processor might be an advantage to the 7 though, with some reviews that I have seen especially emphasizing better low light video quality on the 7. I've taken a few indoor and outdoor videos with the ZS5 and they seem very sharp and clear to me. Certainly the best I've had from a pocket digi camera, so without side by side comparison with the ZS7 it's hard to discount the 5's video quality.Overall, this camera has exceeded my expectations in every way. I have owned 12 digital cameras, everything from ultra compact to DSLR. This camera by far has the most capability vs. portability of any camera I have owned. I've already taken about 300 pictures and several videos, color, contrast, and sharpness are all very impressive. I'm still on my first charge with an indicated 2/3 battery remaining.The automatic mode works great and the auto focusing is the best I've seen outside of a DSLR. The focusing is so fast and accurate, combined with the quick turn on time and very short shutter lag time, this camera is the 'quickest on the draw' I have personally used.This camera is like having my DSLR with a 25-300mm VR lens, combined with my high def video camera, all in a package I can slip in my shirt pocket. In any case I know I will have better results with my ZS5 than a DSLR or the video camera simply because I can have my ZS5 with me almost all the time, ready to get that perfect shot at a moments notice.Amazing, and well worth the wait. 5 stars.By the way the \"Pelican 1010 Micro Case\" fits this camera perfectly and makes a great water resistant/crush proof carrying case. Also highly recommended.

After a year of using the camera, I still find it to be a great super-light \"pocket\" camera with an excellent feature-set (super-wide angle lens, optical image stabilization, intelligent resolution, large variety of auto-exposure settings, and manual exposure control).  Several previous reviewers have done a great job explaining these features, so I won't repeat them here. I consider myself an advanced user, and I like to experiment with several exposures for each composition (whether using this point-n-shoot, or my SLR) - so I always like to travel with (at least) a couple of spare, fully-charged batteries. The battery that came with the camera seems to work as advertised (~300 pictures) and I am still happy with its performance. So, I am upgrading my rating by one star (consider this as 5-stars for the camera, but 2-stars for the battery system & 1-star for Panasonic customer support).Now, the negative (or, why 3 stars?):  Based on warnings from other reviewers (both here and elsewhere), I decided to buy two brand-new Panasonic replacement batteries (from the Amazon marketplace).  Before purchasing, I checked that these were IDENTICAL to the one that came in the original box (PANASONIC DMW-BCG10pp).  I paid over 75% of their list price - so, I did not go for the cheapest batteries out there.  After the batteries arrived, I checked that both came individually wrapped in (seemingly) genuine Panasonic cardboard/plastic packaging.  Both had identical markings their sides, as compared to the original that came with the camera.  However, owing to work/travel commitments, I did not get a chance to test out these new batteries for over 3.5 months. Just recently, I took the batteries out of their packaging, charged them, and tried to use them. But the ZS5 refuses to recognize the battery, shutting down within 3-4 seconds with the message: \"This battery cannot be used\". I waited several hours, recharged the batteries, and tried again - with the same result.  I looked online and found that this message results from ID-secure feature built into their cameras to identify non-Panasonic battery packs.  I then tried Panasonic's support web-site, but found nothing related to either battery problems or firmware updates for the ZS5/ZS7.So, I called Panasonic's customer/tech support (U.S.), hoping for some sort of a firmware download or some other \"re-setting\" procedure that would let me over-ride the camera error-message. To my surprise (and after three phone-transfers), instead of helping me figure out why TWO, BRAND NEW, Panasonic batteries were being rejected by their own camera, the rep kept insisting that I bought the battery over 90-days ago, so they cannot help me!  Now perhaps I am naive, but I consider a battery to be brand new (within a reasonable time-limit, of course), as long as it has not been abused or used before - so it should not matter whether I bought the batteries 90 days vs. 110 days previously (at the time I called them).  They could not even tell me if there are ways to identify a genuine \"PANASONIC\" battery pack!During our extensive online review prior to buying this camera, the battery issue never come up.  But now when I type the exact camera-error message in Google, I get several hits on this subject (all pertaining to Panasonic Lumix cameras).  I was stuck abroad with only a single working battery, and TWO BRAND-NEW batteries that didn't work!  I eventually found a Panasonic vendor in the country I was living in and bought another 'genuine' Panasonic replacement battery for higher than the list price - this new battery pack seems to be working well so far.So, I wanted to put this warning out there that in spite of Panasonic's advertised \"stringent\" standards that purportedly make their batteries so much better, their camera's failure tolerance seems to be so tight that many of their own batteries fall outside of it!  I find it frustrating that there is no way to tell which of the \"PANASONIC\" branded batteries are really genuine until you pop them into the camera - even if you pay attention to details, or fork-out close to the list-price.  So, the lessons learnt for me are: (1)  Don't expect that the \"Panasonic\" brand implies a guarantee of quality or reasonable customer/technical support; (2) If you plan to buy any Panasonic Lumix camera, or any of their new ID-secured battery based cameras, check online for 'battery cannot be used' or 'battery failure' for that camera before purchasing; (3) Be prepared to go through the hassle of trying out several replacement batteries, EVEN if you buy Panasonic's own; and (4) Thoroughly test out any spare replacement batteries you buy within the first 90 days (I guess the last one's a \"DUH!\").I have never bought a camera outside of Canon before, and will most likely go back to Canon after this - I am afraid I cannot trust Panasonic to \"do the right thing\" at this point.

Blake III", "ReviewID": "RKGY966QOS7FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little 12.1 megapixels digital camera but sells with only it's own internal memory......if you want to use a camera card that is an additional purchase. I bought a 8 GB card for my camera for about an extra $20 and it holds a large number of high quality photos.I bought this camera after seeing the photo results from, and hearing the raves about, one my sister bought. It is a very versatile camera and is compact enough to slip in a pocket. It comes in black(my sister's),silver(which I have),blue, and red. It comes with its own compact quick charge battery (2 hours)and charger and it operates an extended time between charges. It has an excellent Leica 12X zoom and wide angle lens. It takes great close up and low light pictures and has a stabilization program to reduce camera shake distortion. It can be operated in simple point and shoot automatic mode or can be controlled manually for real camera buffs. The owner's manual is very basic with no detailed information and you must use the included DVD to discover all the capabilities of the camera. The camera also takes movies but I have not used that feature and that uses a lot of camera memory and will require the additional camera card. The included software program for downloading photos from the camera is easy but working with your camera photos is not as good as an old Olympus camera program I have. I rate the camera a 10 out of 10, but don't like the lack of information in the owner's manual and having to use the DVD to answer any questions about the camera.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera; terrible battery charger renders it almost useless.", "Author": "devotedreader", "ReviewID": "R3U5TVN14P1IHS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This excellent camera requires a proprietary battery charger. It came with the camera but failed after less than a month, and has proven nearly impossible to replace. There are several chargers in the marketplace that CLAIM to be compatible, but aren't. (How much of your time and energy do you want to spend returning parts that should, but don't, work?)  Even Panasonic's website doesn't list the charger as an accessory on their own product page for this camera! Hello??? In desperation, I tried entering the failed charger's part number into Panasonic's own 'Parts Search' option, and got a \"No Match\" message. Not an auspicious sign...What a shame. The camera itself is a pleasure to use and performs well. But on a recent, once-in-a-lifetime trip to the Galapagos Islands the battery charger died. Had I not had several extra pre-charged batteries with me, I'd have been totally out of luck. After several weeks of searching, ordering and returning incompatible chargers, I'm still waiting for one that will enable me to use the camera again.Unless Panasonic gets their act together on rendering this camera useable, i.e., with an easily obtainable battery charger, it's a waste of time and money to buy it, despite its intrinsic quality.

Peolpe used to tell me what wonderful pictures I took with my old olympus OM1, now they tell me what great pictures my \"camera\" takes.... I bought the camera for a recent trip to red rock country in Arizona and also to the Grand Canyon. THe zoom to 31X with the image sabilizer is beyond magical. I have pictures of the rapids from the rim of the canyon! I am a true amateur photographer, who would lug around three lens with my 35mm SLR. Now it all fits in my pocket. I bought Panasonic because I felt like I was going to pay more for the canon name and not get much value for it. I have no head to head to compare to but I don't really care. This camera was less than $200! I do miss the view finder on sunny days, but I find that very few camera have that. The one thing that I miss from the point and shoot camera is that I had a polarizer lens on my other camera lens that really tok out the glare, but unless you go to the SLR body with interhageable lens, I have not seen any other camera, point and shoot, that has that feature. I would get the extra battery. It has saved me on my outings. The other reviewers comments about the bad battery did not was not an issue for me. THe door to change the battery is flimsy, but that is a very weak negatie. I probably use two or three settings on the camera so I really underuilize alot of the other bells and whistles.

The colors are true and does a great job of darks and lights together.  The only thing I really don't like is no delete button for picture just takened. On my Canon, you can delete immediatedly if it's a bad shot, on the Panasonic you have to switch a button and go to the picture. Just another step.

Now I bought the ZS-5 as an upgrade because it has controls for Aperature Priority, Shutter Priority, and \"Manual\" - which is Control of both Aperature and Shutter at the same time. These controls work well, but when I set a slow shutter speed, as an attempt to 'blur' the motion of a spinning fan blade, in bright sunligt, the camera's minimum ISO of 80 was to high, and I was unable to avoid overexposed pictures, even at minimum aperature.The main reason that I bought the ZS-1 was its fantastic lens, and a very small, nearly pocket, sized package. The wide angle equalivent of 25mm is very handy. (The ZS-5 has the same 25mm max. wide) It also zooms to a full resolution of 300mm equalivent. Then it goes higher by using what Panasonic calls \"Intelligent Zoom.\" IZ is actually a cropping process that narrows into the 'heart' of the photo sensor. You can go to 400mm with no noticable degration of picture quality. Then there are higher steps up to 780mm equalivent, but pixel count is reduced to only .3meg. That resolution is suitable for only email attachments. With it 'on,' a 3100mm equivalent available. Digital Zoom on most cameras produces pretty 'grainy' results. One test photo at max. digital zoom looks really good, but of course, image size is good for emails -- no so good for prints.I've shot a little video with the ZS-5. Results were pretty good. It's nice to have this option when not carrying a camcorder.All-in-all, the ZS-5 is a great camera with a lot of features, packed in a very small size. My only complaint is that Panasonic didn't spend the extra 50-cents to provide a printed owners manual. Instead the instructions must be read, or printed, from the supplied CD. With so many features, it is really necessary to read the manual to learn how to take advantage of them.In a nutshell, this is a great little camera.

The images turn out rather dull, you need to \"edit\" the pictures with software on your computer to have them look brighter and with more contrast. Worst, the performance in low-light conditions is abysmal (compared to my previous $149 Sony!). When using the flash, it just gets anything front too bright and the background too dark (again I am comparing with my previous camera). The Image Stabilization does not work well,many pictures look blurry. Autofocus is so-so. Scene selection is cumbersome. etc... etc...

I searched for a bunch of small cameras and finally decided on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS5.  I have a Lumix FZ35 and loved it, so I thought I should give its little brother a try.  One reason why I chose this particular model is that it is one of the few small camera that can record an audio clip along with the picture.The camera is small and light.  The picture quality is above average.  The 720HD video is clear and audio is good.  Unfortunately, it does not use the newer AVHDLite that my FZ35 uses, so the file recorded is much larger.  There is a limit of around 30 minutes per video clip, after which the camera stops recording.  You have to initiate another recording if you want to continue filming.  You can use the optical zoom while recording.  When videoing, zooming is very slow and is not instantaneous like the zoom in the picture taking mode.  When recording an audio clip, it does not save as a separate wav file, instead it records a mini video clip with a static picture.  I guessed it could be seen as good or bad, good in that the mini video contains the picture of the clip; bad in that the sound file is a video clip instead of a sound file.Overall, my friend was happy with the camera.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "P.

This panasonic lumix is one of the best purchase I made in my life to date. This is an excellent camera that produces top quality images. The more I read up on my camera the better my pictures comes out. The camera is a little heavy and not as light as many point and shoot cameras. The size of the camera is also a little bigger then most point and shoot cameras. The video on this camera is really top notch quailty. While you shooting movies you can zoom in on your subject  and increase the sound quailty in your video. The battery need charging after you take about  250 pictures . The only thing negative thing I would say about this camera is that it is not so much a night time camera. It takes excellent pics in day not so much at night.

I had a Canon Elph for 5 years (!!!) before the lens stuck and I decided to upgrade. After a ton of research and reading, I went with the Lumix DMC-ZS5, mostly because I thought I wanted more options and liked the turning menu at the top for quick changes in mode. I also liked the super zoom.The first thing that completely annoyed me was that there was no hard copy of the manual, only a download on my computer. A new camera makes me want to experiment outside with different light and picture modes, and I also wanted to be able to take it to events with my kids and figure out the best options for action, etc. But when the manual is on my computer only, I'm STUCK at my computer, playing with indoor light and fixed objects, which doesn't help me learn the camera while utilizing the manual. So I have never fully read the manual and therefore probably am missing out on lots of camera functions.The second thing I noticed was what a lot of people had complained about before I bought this - there is a shadow on the side of people, like the flash is overpowered or off or something. I don't know enough about photography and proper light to be official with my assessment, but it makes all the people in my photos look somewhat washed out and with a big, lopsided head. I very rarely get super, high-quality photos that I would want to enlarge or hand on the wall with this camera because of that. It also ruined all the photos of my daughter's birth, which is really incredibly sad to me to look through and see none that are good enough for me to want to print and hang.Now, barely 1.5 years after buying the camera, I found the other day when I turned my camera on that there are a bunch of fuzzy black spots all over the picture/lens. Not sure what these are, but they don't go away and in fact get really obnoxious and obvious in bright-light pictures, almost looking like a version of the black smoke from \"Lost.\" Talk about ruining pictures. This camera has been treated very well, rides around in a padded pouch, etc., and I am very upset that it is unusable so soon after I bought it. And to make matters worse, I am headed on vacation in a few days and now have to make a hasty decision and probably spend too much money on a new camera. Will NEVER buy a Panasonic again. Terrible!!The only good thing about this camera is the zoom - it is awesome and the picture is mostly clear if outside.

After 11 months of totally satisfied use the dreaded \"Dark Spots\" began to appear in the view finder and in photos. The dark spots are the result of dust getting into the camera and clinging to the CCD sensor.  I had the same problem with another Lumix camera which resulted in me purchasing this one.  I was just about to send it back to Panasonic (at my expense because cleaning of the camera is not covered under the factory warranty) when I discovered a YouTube video that explained how to open the camera and clean the CCD sensor with compressed air. I successfully cleared the sensor of the dust which was not visible to the naked eye. To sum it all up, this is a camera that takes excellent photos and video but you need to be very aware of the possibility that it will become contaminated with dust. Carrying it in a dust proof case would be a good idea. Beware of bumps and try not to drop it as the shock will most likely result in dust getting into the camera and on the CCD sensor.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera for the money", "Author": "Timothy R.

I urgently needed zoom for my usage, since I need to photograph signs from a great distance and I do need the zoom feature.  I figured I had better purchase the 12x zoom and upgrade instead of buying a camera that went down to an 8x zoom.  For the money, I thought this newer updated version of the Panasonic would be the best choice.  However, when I opened it up and held it for the first time, I was shocked at how cheap it felt.  It seems so much lighter and flimsy compared to the TZ5.  I was at first greatly concerned over the quality of the newer camera, based on how light-weight and \"cheap\" it felt in my hands...not to mention that the so-called instruction book included with it was about 2 pages, and not much info at all.  They did include a software disk with a PDF file of instructions, but upon opening it and reading it, I was let down again.  Not much info there either.  Since I didn't want to go through the hassle of a return or an exchange, I decided to keep the newer camera and try and deal with it.  It isn't a BAD camera, in fact, it seems almost as good a photo quality as my older camera.  The so-called 12x zoom is no different in my opinion than the previous 10x zoom.  Not much difference at all, if any.  But, considering the fact that the older camera actually has NO zoom at all at this time, I suppose I should be grateful.  I don't suppose I have the system mastered with this new camera, as far as deciding how to set anything before taking any pictures, but there isn't any help from the instructions, so I am having to wing it on my own.  I am not as fully satisfied with the picture quality, and I am hoping it is just something that I am not setting right...although I cannot figure out what.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003966MQ8"}}
