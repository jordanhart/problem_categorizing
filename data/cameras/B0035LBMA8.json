Frenkel", "ReviewID": "R3EY85SN4HHBOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Pentax Optio H90 is my eighth digital camera.  I've been shooting digital since 2003 and have owned several Fujifilm and one Samsung.  I still own a Fuji 8mp and a Samsung 12mp.  This background is so that you know I've purchased and learned to use a number of digicams.The Optio H90 is a wonderful little camera.  It has great product design and is easy to hold and use.  It has the softest shutter of any camera I've ever owned and that is a plus.  The controls are very well laid out.  It's internal menus are the easiest, most logical and well thought out of any I've ever looked at or used.  There is surprising depth to what this camera can do.  My favorite feature is what Pentax calls \"Memory.\"  This function allows you to set and have the camera remember, each time you turn it on, an extensive list of settings. The coolest of these items is the ability to zoom the camera to any focal length and have the H90 recall it.  So if between the 28 - 140mm (35 equivalent) focal lengths you'd like to maybe start around a 50mm lens equivalent, you can do it.  There is also a \"Green Button\" that allows you to take your favorite variable function and bring it out of the menu and onto the green button.  I use mine to bracket exposures.The photos are of very good quality, but perhaps just a bit soft in low light.  Pentax has a post shot stabilization system, Pixel Track SR, that actually works quite well.  There is a slight delay when it functions, but no more so that other cameras \"fix\" computations.  The menu and mode functions offer an enormous variety of settings.  The \"OK\" button sets what information you can see on the LCD screen.  You just push it to see more or less information.  The Optio H90 comes is three color varieties, I got the silver and ceramic white job, a very clean looking product.  The screen is quite good, even in bright sunlight, but you will probably want to brighten it some to shoot is direct sun.  The camera doesn't have an automatic brightness mode.  It's very reasonably priced, as well.Of course, it's not perfect.  I wish it had a bit more battery life, it's about average for its class I would say.  In the review mode the lens does not retract.  I wish it would, in order to protect against accidental touching of the lens or possible damage.  The camera batteries don't charge in the camera.  That would be nice, too.  I bought a $6 SD/USB reader and upload photos to my Macs using it, thereby saving a bit of battery life.My conclusion is that the Pentax Optio is a great camera for beginners through advanced amateur photographers.  It is a camera you'll want to keep on your person at all times. The H90 delivers quality images in a huge varietiy of shooting situations.  I've taken great macro photos as well as scenics with it.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and very capable digital camera.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good value for what it is.", "Author": "Thaeyo", "ReviewID": "RTL7B0FP05EQT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not a professional photographer nor am I an amateur.

Alsabbagh", "ReviewID": "R34BDVF9VR4JEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the camera.  It's simple to use and is loaded with features. It's not an SLR, but it's handy and fits in my pocket.  The only thing is that it would've been better if it used AA or AAA batteries.  I guess I have to buy a backup battery for emergencies.  I like the different shooting settings. It can even take clear pictures in low-light settings.  I was able to take some nice shots of the total lunar eclipse although I just got the camera a couple of days before.  You can edit pictures on the camera without the software and it creates a second copy, leaving the original intact.  You can stitch 3 pictures for panoramic view, right on the camera and it's easy to do it.  It basically shows you the edge for the first frame, which you can superimpose over the object and take the second frame then repeat for the third frame.What I don't understand is why different color models have vary that much in price!!!", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "J.

That Canon is a 7.1 megapixel camera and I've been very happy with the shots produced by that camera.  Only problem I had with it was that there was a good deal of lag between pressing the shutter button and the picture being taken -- easy to miss good shots.My only previous experience with Pentax is the K10D SLR that I've had for three years as well, and I absolutely love that camera.  It is fantastic.  Pentax is great in my book.  When looking for a new point & shoot, I thought I'd give Pentax a try given how much I like their SLR.The best thing I can say about the Optio H90 is that the shutter is faster than the SD1000, and it has a burst mode that will take continuous shots that my earlier point & shoot does not have, although it reduces the resolution to 5 megapixels in the burst mode.Unfortunately, the picture quality of the Optio H90 is nowhere near as good as what even the SD1000 produces.  I realized I'd make a mistake buying the H90 as soon as I looked at the first pictures I'd snapped.  By comparison to the Elph, the pictures taken by the H90 are very noisy, even at the lower ISO settings.  Ramping the ISO up makes it a lot worse.  Pictures in low light without a flash are terrible -- and the flash blows everything out.  The flash is particlarly disappointing -- its range is very short, and it is overpowered and/or the camera doesn't appropriately adjust itself when using the flash.  Flash pictures look terrible.As I said, I've tried very hard to like this camera.  I've gone through the manual (which is a plus for this camera that you do get a very good sized printed instruction manual that is very detailed) and experimented with all of the modes and settings.  I spent the afternoon today outside taking pictures with both this H90 and the SD1000.  No question that the SD1000 takes superior pictures.  It captures more detail and the pictures are brighter, and much more pleasing to the eye.I've never written a negative review like this before, but after today I feel a need to let others know of my issues with this camera.  I read the reviews before buying this camera, and the only negatives that stuck with me at the time were the short battery life -- which is true, the battery life is short.  Which also bites because I listened to those reviews and ordered several additional spare batteries at the time I ordered the camera.

She needed it for an introductory course to photography.As the other 1 star review points out, some of the online reviews (other sites besides Amazon) for this model might be deceptive.Image quality is lacking, and noise is a real problem unless shooting at very low ISO speeds.  I wouldn't recommend it as an entry level point and shoot.  If you are purchasing a camera for a first time user, you'll probably do better with a camera that has more consistent results.The one I bought also developed a black spot on the LCD display during the first week of use.I'm very disappointed as I thought Pentax would have better quality, even on low end products.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pentax Optio H90 camera", "Author": "Peggy/Maine", "ReviewID": "R2Q6CG6RLK34T8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the camera that I had purchased as a gift for my parents, that I ended up keeping for myself.

Also, after a full charge the battery meter would go to yellow after about 20 shots.  It also will not allow eye-fi transfers at that battery level.Youre better off just turning off the eye-fi portion and changing the standby settings to let the card do it itself, but then your drain your battery even faster.Returned it for a Sony DSC-W560 and that is miles ahead.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Eye Fi Compatibility", "Author": "n. rivera", "ReviewID": "R2QTASOJ5IVYUK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for the Eye Fi compatibility but was disappointed.

I've done a lot of research and all reviews on this camera were ecstatic.  I've already owned 2 Pentax cameras ( DSLR's) and I've had no issues with them at all.  Quality and features are excellent on those.  This camera is a direct opposite. I've tried 2 different Optio H90's before coming to this conclusion.  The first one was the orange one.  When I tried taking pictures with it on auto settings, the pictures come out all grainy, even with flash on and in pretty well lit room.  Seems the camera is stuck on iso 800 no matter what the lighting is.  After taking several shots on different settings, the camera started freezing up.  A call to tech support confirmed that camera was defective.  I returned the camera and ordered a silver one as a replacement, just to be sure I don't get the the same defective one back.  Well much to my disappointment the new camera continued taking same crappy quality pictures, all grainy and underexposed.  When setting iso down to 80 or 100 manually and using flash the pictures come out dark and not sharp at all, even when using a tripod.  I spent about an hour on the phone with Pentax tech, going through different manual settings and both he and I came to the conclusion that this camera is just bad product.  I took sample pictures with my old Canon sd500 and Optio H90 with same lighting and same distance and same manual settings and the difference was just day and night, Pentax picture quality was no better than a cheap disposable camera that takes iso 800 pics.  Needless to say I returned this camera as well.  I have no idea whether all those websites and magazines that did the review on this camera just got paid to give good review or they if they received a \"ringer\" but after having tried 2 of these I can honestly tell you not to waste your money on it...", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.1 megapixel CCD\n720p high-definition video at 30 fps\nWide-angle, 5x optical zoom lens (28-140mm equivalent)\n2.7\" LCD display\nArt gallery inspired aesthetics with an ultra slim design", "Name": "Pentax Optio H90 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Ceramic White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mJKJVTgbL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0035LBMA8"}}
