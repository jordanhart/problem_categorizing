Something better than the rest.  Sometimes you just don't feel like the usual selection is good enough.  I already had a Canon, everyone and their brother had a Nikon.I was thinking about the slim line Casio, but who wants to buy a Casio?So one late night / early morning I found this Leica.  It looked different than the Canon/Nikon/Casio/Olympus and plus it had that little red badge on the front.  I had to have it.I found a local dealer on the Leica website and the next day I bought it for the same price as Amazon.BTW, I knew there was a Panasonic version for half the price.  I bought into the cosmetic of the Leica, the story, and that little red badge.Supposedly this model has different firmware than the Panasonic which gives your JPEG files a color palette similar to classic Leica cameras.It does not shoot in RAW.DesignThe look of this camera is gorgeous.  It is very understated but an instant classic design.  The build quality is also very good.  It doesn't attract unwanted attention but once you put your hands on it you know it is a well built product.Ease Of UseThe button layout is nice.  It is simple and clean with access to shortcuts for flash, exposure, self timer, and review.Choosing auto settings or manual mode is easy and the icons make sense.I wish there were shortcuts for shutter speed and ISO settings.  To access those you have to get into the menu which is time consuming and cumbersome.  PS most cameras are like that though.ErgonomicsIt is so small and thin that it is kind of hard to hold steadily.  Definitely use the wrist strap because it has slipped out of my hands a few times.Picture QualityThis is very subjective.  With good lighting I love the way my pictures turn out.  Colors are very natural and not over saturated at all.  It is very hard to get \"tac sharp\" shots with it but I don't think that is the point of a point and shoot.With average or difficult lighting this point and shoot really struggles.  I hate using high ISO settings because anything over 400 has a lot of noise of this camera.  The flash blows out the picture if you are less then 6 feet away.  It isn't powerful enough in a dim room if you are more then 8 feet away.  There are no controls to dial down the flash.  To get a good picture with or without flash you spend a lot of time changing exposure, ISO, and shutter speed.  There is a +/- 2 exposure control but the shutter speed can only be set to a maximum of 1 second in manual mode.  ISO can  be set from 100-1250 but again anything over 400 has a lot of noise.  Using \"simple mode\" usually jacks up the ISO settings in dark rooms or uses the flash which is useless most of the time.  You can get a good shot in a dark room or outdoors but it will take some time to set it up.ExtraIncludes a copy of Photoshop Elements which is a fun program to add effects to your photos.OverallIf you are thinking about this for outdoor day trips to the beach or mountains then this might be a good choice for you.  If you want something to take to parties and nights out with your friends then you need to find something with better low light performance and a smarter auto mode.  I don't regret buying it but it is not all that I hoped for considering Leica's reputation and premium price.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Leica C-Lux 2", "Author": "M.

Here is a short and simple synopsis of what I found:PROS:The material and workmanship of the product are supurb. The design is flawless and all controls are easy to access. You don't have to go deep into the menu to change basic important features. The \"self protrait\" feature works very well. Color and low light capture are superior.CONS:The macro feature is only OK. The landscape pictures I took were poor. I tried all the different settings, took about 50 pictures and only a handful were acceptable to me. The video capture is OK with somewhat poor sound quality. You can't zoom while filming.Overall, this is an interesting little camera. But for the price there are better alternatives like the Sony T-100. It is incredible both for pictures and video.", "Date": "May 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "An Amazing Ultra-Compact", "Author": "Boulder Vasil", "ReviewID": "R2OZICFLPB461R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Leica C-Lux 2 for a few months now, and am happy to report that it is a fantastic camera.  I appreciate the small size and light-weight and the fantastic image quality.  I upgraded from an older Canon Powershot that was only 4.2MPs and over twice the size.  Needless to say, I could not be happier!  I really like the fact that, although small and compact, the camera still feels solid.  That is, there are some other ultra-small cameras I looked at that which felt flimsy (plastic-y and not durable), but the Leica (despite its super small size) does not have this quality.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality piece of electronics!", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "super little cam", "Author": "R. K.

A great little device for the small purse or pocket, with satisfactory wide angle and telephoto capabilities; all contained in a package comparable to the size of my Motorola Razr!Offering easy to employ features, this camera provides razor-sharp digital images and reprints follow suit. I was in awe at how spectacular finished enlargements appear, while maintaining their artistic integrity.

Antone", "ReviewID": "R32069JQWAFLJI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am *extremely* impressed by this little Leica.This will be a rather short review since this camera model is already, like, 300 years old in dog years.I was able to pick a new one up for less than [...] on the internets from someone who clearly didn't know what they were parting with. When I inquired into why the party was selling she only told me that her husband needed something newer.I have owned and used dozens of cameras (Leica, Nikon, Canon, Rollie, Mamiya) in my career.The C-LUX 2 is an amazing unit in terms of color authenticity, image quality, zoom quality, sensitivity, precision, workmanship, and most of all: usability and convenience.I cannot stress how perfect the menu system is on this camera. It's perfect and the controls are precise, accurate, and delightful to use.Convenience means that having this camera in your pocket you will never miss a great shot no matter where you are. Yes it really is that good. With controls from scene mode to nearly manual you have precise control of your pictures. There is no reason you cannot achieve a National Geo picture with this camera.When the C-LUX 2 debuted at [.........] it was really a Euro-jet-setting no-show. Now that you can find this gem below [....] it is a must have.5 stars based on current market conditions and availability in late 2008. Good luck finding a mint unit.

I sent it to the Leica shop to get it fixed which cost several hundred dollars.  For $260 (which is what I ended up paying for it total), it was completely worth it.  It's stylish, it takes great photos, it's tiny; basically it's perfect.  But honestly, there's no way it's worth the full price new.  The photos are really nice, but maybe I'm spoiled by my DSLR, which takes photos whose quality easily rivals film.  I mean, they're just not that nice, if you get what I'm saying.  If you can find one of these cameras used, I say snap it up.

It is lightweight and fits easily in a pocket or purse.  The menus are intuitive, and the quality of the pictures taken is much better than anything I've seen from point-'n'-shoot cameras in the past.  I even plugged it into my 42\" television and projected the pictures I took in that format.  I was amazed the even when blowing the image up to that size I still did not get any distoration or pixel loss.The one problem I have had is that for some reason it quit working about a month after I got it.  And that is why it only got 4-stars. The lens all of a sudden refused to retract when I turned the camera off.  And when I turned it on, the message I got was to turn it off and turn it back on again.  That process cycled over and over.  The camera is in the shop now.[EDIT - Jan 2, 2009]  Well, I got it baack from the shop and took it on vacation with me in early November 2008.  The camera functioned properly, and produced some exceptional pictures, mostly from a moving vehicle, since I was using my SLR when out of the car.  Then, after returning home, it failed again in mid-December, for no particular reason.  It hasn't been dropped or abused in any way.  It just quit, so now I'm looking at another repair.Warrantee or not,the postage costs me money, not to mention the time it takes for repair, during which I don't have a small camera at my side.

The mechanism to cover/uncover the lens was faulty. When I turn the camera the lens come out but remains covered. Sometimes it just opens halfway. I don't know if other owners have experienced the same problems, but considering how delicate is this mechanism, I imagine is a problem with the model in general. The area around the lens scratches easily, so consider it a warning if you're going to put this camera in your pocket. I wouldn't blame you because it's the perfect pocket size, but it's also a pricey camera. I'm not crazy about picture quality but could be because I have a far superior digital SLR.
