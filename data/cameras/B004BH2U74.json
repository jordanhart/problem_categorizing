We had purchased several cheap digital pocket cameras over the years and all lasted a year or so.  We decided to spend a few extra dollars and purchase this camera and are very glad we did.  It takes great photos, even at a distance.  Like I said, we are not photographers, but the pics this camera takes makes us look like one.  It took about 2-3 days of steady use to understand most of the functions, some are still complicated to us, but we'll figure it out as we go along.  This is a very nice camera that takes amazing photos.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "AWSOME DEAL", "Author": "sw", "ReviewID": "R2QY2X5ZKBDOQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything came in GREAT condition. The product shiped fast! The Camera quality is unbelievable! I have never had a camera that took such great photo's. I had purchased this camera to take up photography as a hobby and I was very impressed with how easy and clear all the photos have came out. I had read a review from a man about this camera saying that he could see all the individual hairs on his cat; He was right! Every hair on my cats body was clearly visible.I have mainly used the camera for memories of my 2 yeaar old son and I have been able to catch some awsome clear/focused shots. I would recamend this camera and even buying it in this package.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fuji FinePix HS20", "Author": "Picman", "ReviewID": "R3FTP9DZTN9RV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome.
