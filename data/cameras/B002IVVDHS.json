{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice Upgrade.. but", "Author": "TomAzon", "ReviewID": "R1E9FTAKD5OR48", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the C-190 as an upgrade to my Kodak C-643 6.1 megapixel camera (See my review).  Comparing the two, the C-190 takes better quality photos (although I have taken some great shots with the C-643) and outside of the doubling of megapixels, the C-190 takes better low-light pictures, plus the video section takes better low-light videos.  The C-643 only took good videos in good light.  The C-190 has a 5x optical zoom and can use the SDHC cards.  I also like its panoramic feature.  The best advantage is the cost.  This camera costs less new than the C-643 did.Smart capture works on both cameras.  All those people who think it's a \"joke\" should read the instructions.  Just hold the button down halfway until the green brackets show, take the shot and you'll get better pictures.On the con side, I don't know why there's no viewfinder. Sometimes bright sunlight can wash-out the image on the LCD screen.  For some reason, there's no little speaker to hear the sounds on the videos as the C-643 has.  I also liked the C-643's \"camera sounds\".One other thing I don't like is that when you're in the SCN mode to choose your photo mode, the choices shown don't stay on the screen very long unless you keep scrolling through them.  Also, it may have made for a convenient design to use one door for the SDHC card plus the batteries but it is easier to use one door for the card just on the chance that the batteries may fall out otherwise while you're trying to take the card out.UPDATE: I've taken good pictures but pictures using the self-timer tend to be out of focus.  I sent it to Kodak and sure enough they had to re-adjust it and download software for it.  It did make a difference but it's still a touchy camera when it comes to in-focus pictures. Keep experimenting....", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good zoom; really like this camera", "Author": "jetwriter", "ReviewID": "R1N4VTVSQ92EPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Maybe the first reviewer got a lemon?I really like the color of the camera. My camera turned on immediately, guess I didn't check polarity of the batteries. It would be nice to have a hard copy manual. I tested the camera at all the pixel settings. I'm not able to tell the difference. Amature user. However, I did take a zoom pic at 1.2mp of a playground about 1/4 block away. It didn't look like much in the lcd screen. I uploaded it to the computer. using MS Paint/Fax viewer I was able to zoom in close enough to almost read the printing on the woman's sweatshirt. Now that scene would have been a great test for the various pixels.The shutter lag isn't any longer than any other camera of this type. I liked the video option of zooming in while filming. It was easy to focus in on the potted flowers on the porch of the neighbors down the street. It didn't seem to chew up batteries. I took about 40+ pic and 2.5 min video with enough battery juice to spare. I do like the battery charge indicator on the screen. The menu was clear and easy to use. It was a matter of a couple clicks to change the pixel setting. Another nice thing is that the lcd screen layout changed with the pixel adjustments so you can see what type of pic that is being taken.I'm very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak C190", "Author": "Denis Barnes \"A N Alien\"", "ReviewID": "R1CORXFF5JWCX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned some other digital cameras that were not as easy to use.

And when they instantly go dead, the camera doesn't close the lens, it just locks up and takes hours to finally turn the light off.  I was afraid to remove the card the first time with the camera in 'on' mode until the light went out, afraid it would erase the existing images to take the card out.  Since it happens every time the batteries suddenly die, I finally got up the nerve to open the cover and remove the batteries right away, then the light will go out even though the lens stays extended. I take the card out, put in new batteries, and it will close the lens, then power it off.  Then I feel it's safe to reinsert the card.  It seems to have a mind of its own on Auto, sometimes it will flash and sometimes not in the same spot, same area, having one good shot and one almost black with major grainy image, not like you can lighten it.  Sometimes the flash won't go off in ANY mode, regardless of \"flash on\" being selected in each.  At least 50% of all photos in all modes are too blurry to use, a problem with the auto focus. The C190 did occasionally take wonderful shots that I couldn't ask for better, but were so sporadic I could never depend on it and was honestly surprised when I did get a good shot.  Lastly, the paper-thin plastic tab on the battery cover that's expected to hold up against the strong pressure of the spring under the batteries and card just snapped yesterday while the camera was laying on a table.  Cover popped open and one battery shot out. Cover can't be replaced by user, must be sent off and the process will take around 3-4 weeks before you can get it back.  This is my 3rd Kodak camera to have a problem with the lens cover that made the camera useless (only had this one 6 months) so I'm giving up and moving on to a different brand.  Just wish I knew which one I could trust!", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not worth your money or time! Buyer beware!", "Author": "GRCTalk", "ReviewID": "R31Q7CREQKSQU1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my second Kodak C190 replacement and both cameras would not format 2G SanDisk SD or 4G PNY SDHC cards. I've purchased new PNY and SanDisk cards from two to 4 gigabytes. The C190 constantly displayed unable to read or format cards after numerous attempts. The formatting with camera abnormally terminated each time!I formatted cards using my computer with FAT, and inserted cards and same problem. I'm greatly disappointed with Kodak C190 camera and expected better quality.My Nikon and Sony digital point and shoot, and DSLR cameras do not require formatting cards before taking pictures. I'm a professional photographer with 25 years experience, and this was my first and possible last experience with Kodak camera, especially this model. I'm returning it tonight (two days) after replacing first unit Saturday morning for refund. I'm not risking exchanging for third time!My first C190 would not format cards initially, but finally worked, but the flash would not work, no matter how dark the setting and/or flash mode used.I tried to use it Saturday for my daughter's birthday gathering at local restuarant, but on able to use available memory to shot eight pictures. The quality was great, but I had a new 2G SanDisk SD card loaded, but unable to use because it could not read or format. I lost precious moment picture opportunities because this camera failed to perform!I like the 12 MP format, but did get some out of focus pictures, those I deleted. Very good face recognition. It delivered as promised. The contruction was good. Ease of use was average. Use the SCN setting to take better pictures, I got this tip from online C190 PDF manual. I was pleased with blue color and construction was good. I liked the big LCD screen too.I wished there were no problems with formatting cards. My other digital cameras pont and shoot, and DSLR (Sony, Nikon, and HP) do not require pre-formatting cards as Kodak's C190.Bottom line, this was my first experience with Kodak, and it was disappointing. They make great film, but this camera model needs to be tossed in trash bin.Don't waste your time or money!Respectfully.GRCTalk", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it!", "Author": "truthbetold", "ReviewID": "R2FY52TSA4MS6O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buyer Beware--I should have looked at all the reviews before I bought this.

I have to say, this was not the greatest camera. I got it as a Christmas gift. I've had it for about 2 1/2 years and had been pretty happy with it. It is, however, cheaply made. One accidental drop broke the battery compartment latch, and for the past year, I've had to secure it with tape. Soon after that, my lens suddenly started acting up. It wouldn't turn on unless I pried the lens open, and took of the silver edge off the camera lens. It takes a good 2 - 3 minutes to get the camera on. Another irritating problem was the LCD screen. If I was in the sunlight or a well-lit room, the LCD screen would turn into a mirror, so all I could see was myself and whatever was behind me. I could barely see what I was trying to take a picture of. It also had 3 to 4/10 pictures that were fuzzy and were ruined which in some cases really stunk because they would have been beautiful with a different camera. The other problem I had was the easyshare software. That took up TONS of space on my computer making it go really slow. It took quite a while to upload the photos, no matter how many or how little I had. As far as the photos and everything else goes, it's pretty good for a camera costing over $100. The nighttime indoor pictures are way better than I expected. It beats my Fujifilm Finepix T350, which cost much more and was rated much more higher. It takes a wonderful video, I've only found it annoying that if you zoom, the camera records the clicking of the zoom, sometimes ruining the video. The Camera also does not have a speaker, so you can not listen to your video until you download it. It has the habit of giving you blurry photos often. I love it's panoramic view, it's really nice that you can go left to right or right to left. I also really have enjoyed it's other modes. It also has a tagging feature as well as a date stamp or email, so if you're connected, you can email a photo. That is really nice.  I would rate this a 2 1/2, maybe a 3, but due to it being pretty cheaply made, it's poor photos, and the video, I will not go higher.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "wouldn't recommend this camera", "Author": "law", "ReviewID": "R1U3CU6EA5RFNI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for almost 2 years now.

They said there is something wrong with the camera. Unfortunately it is not under warranty because I never used it because of the problems I was having. I just knew it had to be something I was doing wrong. I contacted Kodak several times with no success. They suggested I get a sun shade (doesn't work) and try to adjust the brightness settings (also doesn't work). Now they want me to try anti glare screen protectors.
