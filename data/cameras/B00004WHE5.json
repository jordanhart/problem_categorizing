Best Price/Performance Tradeoff Out There!", "Author": "wcc2", "ReviewID": "RU4EB0HZTPTYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the Olympus D460Zoom to the D490Zoom. The D460 is a fine camera - I was generally very pleased with it. But having owned the  D460Zoom for six months, I found two major faults. First, the \"boot-up  time\" (how quickly after you turn the camera on that it is ready to  shoot) and the lack of \"burst\" shooting (the ability to take one  shot quickly after another). These two faults lead to frustration when  trying to take any type of action photos with the D460. You see the action  emerging, but the camera is still booting up; you take a shot, but the  action gets better and you want to take another but the D460 says \"not  yet\" because it is still writing the first photo to the media.  Infuriating.The D490 addresses each of these problems beautifully. Boot  up time is about 20% faster. Timing both of my cameras side-by-side, the  D490 is faster (1.1 seconds versus 1.3 seconds, in five trials using the  same 32Mb media cards). More important than boot up time is burst shooting.  The D490 has a RAM buffer that allows you to take about 1 shot per second  in the \"HQ\" mode (2.1 megapixels with JPEG compression). The D460  requires about 2.5 seconds between shoots in the same \"HQ\" mode  (but the resolution is 1.3 megapixels). Also nifty if you are using the TFT  screen to take shots, there is a \"gas gauge\" showing you how full  the memory buffer is as you are shooting.I simply can't express how  happy these faster response time made me, especially at this price. I was  so unhappy with the D460's sluggishness that I was about to buy the $900  Olympus C3030. Similar to the C3030, the D490 also can take QuickTime  movies (though much shorter ones). Another nice D490 feature is that you  can erase all photos off a card while the card is still in the camera,  instead of having to do the erasing on your computer (I often forget to  erase after downloading to the computer, put the media card back in and  find it still full when I want to take more pictures).While the D490  lacks the C3030's B&W options it does have the two more important  features - the QuickTime movies and the burst shooting (both admittedly not  as good as the C3030, but likely good enough for most of us). Beyond the  $400 saving, the D490 still retains a much smaller footprint; it can easily  slip into a pants or shirt pocket. As for the enhancement from 1.3 to  2.1 megapixels (D460 vs D490), I can't really tell much difference. I took  two identical shots both \"HQ\" mode, printed them 4x6 on my  HP970Cxi; they look the same. Currently the D490 is about $100 more than  the D460. I would say the \"burst\" shooting alone is easily worth  the extra money. Go and get one!

Amazon didn't sell this  reader at the time I write this.  The card reader is a necessity, a full  16MB card will take about 20 seconds to transfer with the reader, using the  serial port you can go have lunch or something while it downloads.  NiMH  batteries are also a necessity, for the price of a few lithium batteries  you can get 8 NiMH batteries and a charger, that way you can always have a  set charged up.Image quality is excellent.  I was looking at the C3030  and couldn't see spending that much for a few extra features and another  million pixels.  Unless you plan on printing out 8x10 prints the extra  resolution isn't needed, use the extra money on accessories.  Printing the  D490 HQ images at 3x5 inches they look as good as 35mm prints.  I have run  several tests shooting the same image using all the modes of the camera and  found the best mode to use is normal HQ, under certain conditions SHQ will  give you  better color reproduction and slightly sharper edges.  The  SHQ-TIFF mode images are huge and I have yet to see any difference between  it and SHQ mode, even in macro mode with a complex object the images look  the same.  As for the soft setting and the digital zoom, you are better off  taking a normal HQ image and using software on the computer to soften or  resize.The QuickTime movie feature is fun to play with, kinda like  having an old 8mm movie camera.  I like the fact that you have to raise the  flash manually, if you don't want to use the flash you know it's off when  it's down.  That's better than having to find a button and look at a  display to tell if you've turned it off.The size, price, and image  quality make this a great camera to have.", "Date": "September 9, 2000"}, {"Title": "D-490 camedia", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R25YCF3K43DUI0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After purchasing the D490, I found this camera extremely easy to operate  and to be the best digital camera for this price, that not only takes still  shots, but also MPEG movies.

The D490 is  lightweight (in fact, most of the weight is the batteries) and easy to use,  although on the downside, I find that the manually operated shutter closing  mechanism to be slightly awkward as the lens has to retract fully before  the shutter can close completely.

Out of the box I was taking still and movie pictures within about ten minutes. Not only is the camera extremely easy to use, but the manual does a great job of explaining the features and functions with minimal confusion. The only exception here is that I didn't find information in the manual on how to switch to the SQ-HIGH and SHQ-TIFF modes. I later found out that to switch to the latter, the user must hold the \"up\" arrow for two seconds. I still haven't figured out how to access the SQ-HIGH.Quality wise, the D-490 Zoom takes crystal clear and colorful images, capturing details that my Olympus film camera couldn't possibly match. The zoom features allow the user to take close-up shots of subjects quite a distance away, while the macro feature allows true close-ups from as little as four or five inches away.My comments about specific features are:1. The built-in multi-mode flash does an excellent job of balancing degrees of light on and around the photo subject. 2. The red-eye and slow-synch features, combined with the 12-second timer resulted in a warm close-up self-portrait that makes it hard to believe no one was holding the camera! 3. The LCD screen is clear and true to actual color, giving the viewer a good idea of what the actual image will look like. 4. The clarity of the images that I downloaded were extremely clean, even at the mid-setting (HQ and SHQ).The only real downside I found to the Olympus D-490 Zoom is that downloading images to the computer using the serial cable is VERY slow. I had read and heard this, but until I downloaded the images myself, I hadn't realized just how slow. Still, once the download was complete, the resulting images made up for the wait.The Olympus D-490 Zoom is overall a wonderful camera, far exceeding my expectations, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality digital camera. I would suggest, however, purchasing at least a 32MB memory card, as well as the USB card reader. With the 32MB card, you shouldn't have to worry about running out of image space, and the USB card reader will allow you transfer/download images at about 1MB per second.", "Date": "January 8, 2001"}, {"Title": "Affordable 2+ Megapixel Digital Camera", "Author": "Shawn R Vernon", "ReviewID": "R1NFUSETDZ2VFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, i would like to suggest that the writer of the previous review check which product he or she is bashing before posting a review with starred ratings. The Olympus D490 camera is worth your wait. I have been watching the market, waiting for the digital camera that would take high quality photos and would be balanced as a camera. I have broken the plusses and minuses of the review below for your reading easePlusses + Size (At first I was almost dissapointed that the camera was so small. I have been used to seeing digital cameras that were huge and unweildy. The D490 Actually is the same size as film using relatives in the Olympus family. If you use the optical viewfinder instead of the LCD screen, most people wont have a clue that you even are using a digital camera)+ Ease of use (The D490 is very easy to use. The included software makes downloading the images easy, and the camera operates like any other regular camera.)+ Pictures (The pictures are beautiful. They are huge and vivid.)+ Speed (The camera uses a RAM buffer to store the images temporarily as they are written to the EEPROM Chip. What this means is that you are able to take multiple photos while the camera is writing the pictures to memory. This is a marked advantage over the D460, and is discussed in another user's review)+ Reliability (I've had it a few months, never had a problem yet.)+ Movies! (This camera takes 15 second high quality movies! It also has an option to take low quality 60 second movies, however since the high quality movies only have a resolution of 320 by 240, the low quality ones really are worthless... for reference i think they are 160 by 120)Minuses- Software problems (I think it may just be the software i got since i havent heard anyone else complain in this area, but my camedia software cannot splice together the panoramic shots.... oh well... i didnt buy the camera solely for this purpose so it doesnt bother me so much)- Movies dont have sound- Lack of USB connectivity (This feature is a must these days, and although i did get a Viking USB card reader, it would have been a great feature to add one into the camera to begin with)Overall i think this camera is GREAT. Digital cameras are still a bit pricey for most people, and really the consumer is still paying a hefty chunk of the R+D costs instead of the manufacturing costs, however when a company produces such a high quality product such as this one, i dont really mind it.If you want a digital camera buy this one.", "Date": "November 27, 2000"}, {"Title": "Totally Worth Your Money!", "Author": "Tavi", "ReviewID": "R13FQWN760ZA3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AOL is advertising two digital cameras.

The camera has enough nice features to make it a pleasure to use without overwhelming the user with too much configurability.

The rapid sequence capability allows you to take actions shots (like kids playing soccer) without the standard 2-3 second delay.  The camera has an onboard cache that allows HQ quality pictures to be taken at a sub-second rate.

You can spend a weekend reading the manual and playing with all the features, or you can read the quick instructions and take your first pics ten minutes after you get the box open.  There are lots of choices on resolution, and zoom is a great feature.  This camera also takes panorama shots and quick time movies.  You download to your computer using a serial port, which although people tell me it's slow, I find extremely handy, as I can use almost any computer - my one at work, home, my boyfriend's house, etc., without worrying whether or not there is USB support.

The pictures were execellent in the HQ and SHQ modes (1600x1200), the SQ mode (640x480) was okay for posting on the web. I have a 35mm Olympus XA2 which is almost the same size so I am comfortable with the D490Zoom. If you're the type of person who's in a rush all the time you might want to get a different camera as you do have to wait a few \"long seconds\" for the lens to come out or go back in when open/close the front sliding lens cover. It isn't a big deal for me. Also the flash doesn't present a problem to me and I like the fact that I can control if it is up or down. You do have to be careful when closing the sliding lens cover (but I haven't lost a lens cap yet either). The only negative I found was that the manual mentioned the 5 modes but didn't say how to get to SQ-HIGH and SHQ-TIFF.

It small enough to fit in your pocket, but rich enough in features and resolution to give you years of great memory capture.  The 3x optical zoom is the best reason to buy.  It's enough zoom to shorten most distance shots, but not so much zoom that you have a bulky lens.  The lens retracts behind a sliding shutter that keeps it cleans and safe from lens scratches while in your pocket.  The viewing screen is sharp and clear, and displays the additional zooming feature of the 2.5x digital zoom.  And because it's a 2.1 megapixel, these digitally zoomed shots retain their clarity.  Only drawback to this camera is a manual flip up flash.  One less thing to break, but causes you to miss some shots by not remembering to flip it up, (not a reason not to buy however).

What a great little camera! I was able to take photos right out of the box without spending a lot of time reading the manual. The pictures are fantastic! I haven't experienced the massive battery drain reported in other reviews but maybe I haven't used it long enough. I use the HQ setting the most and they turn out fabulous, even printing in 8x10. The downside(s): It takes FOREVER to download the photos to the computer using the serial interface. I am anxiously waiting for my USB reader. Also, the sliding lens cover is a little tricky-if you close it too far it can hang up the lens when it's trying to retract, which can't be good for the motor. Also, the lens cover is a little \"sticky\" to slide, not as smooth as you'd want. The lift-up flash (not automatic) is a little inconvenient, but I'm used to it now and it's not a real problem. I mostly take pictures of my pets, so red-eye (actually, green-eye) is always present with the flash and has to be edited out. There is a red-eye reduction feature, but the dogs won't cooperate! It works well with people, however.On my printer, DeskJet 720C, I have to use the highest quality print feature so the photos don't come out fuzzy. But at the right setting they are perfect.

Along with that, I'm not able to access any user's guide to the software - other than the help menu, which is not much help.

There is a magic wand editing tool that I simply cannot figure out, and can't find any help for.  Will have to call tech support, I guess.To overcome these problems, I bought an HP 932c printer (around $150), and use the Microsoft Photo Editor (already on my computer) to create fantastic printed photos - look like they came from the developer.  I made some gorgeous greeting cards by taking a picture of some flowers, then using the stained-glass effect in MS Photo Editor and printing them out.  Too cool!

I am still using the lithium batteries that came with the camera; still showing full charge even after 150 shots and lots of \"show and tell\" through the LCD for my friends.  I do use the add-on AC adapter to power the downloads, though.  About that downloading:  Using the serial port, takes about an hour to download the entire 64 meg card.

Comparing to the other similar cameras, in retrospect it looks like Fuji and HP offer cameras with similar features at lower cost; but I cannot tell you whether they provide worse pictures or not.  This one (490Z) has many good flash, exposure and focus modes as well as an easy point and shoot default.  The QuickTime movie capability attracted me but in reality I have no use for it.  I suppose it would be good if you have a web site and want to put 10-second QuickTime movies of your cat up on it or something.  The camera is also a little bigger than I would prefer- it doesn't fit into my shirt pocket for example- I believe Fuji's comparable is smaller.  Again, I cannot vouch for Fuji's or HP's quality- Olympus might be worth the extra cost, I don't know.

It also has very nice advanced features (e.g., white balance, manual ISO overides, resolution options, special flash functions, etc), so it's both a great snapshot camera for inexperienced users and it has plenty of features for experience photographers as well.  The user interface is strange - downright counter-intuitive at times.  For example, opening the lens cover turns the camera on (suppose I just want to wipe the lens off?), and you can't view images you've taken already unless the camera's turned off.  Also, the CaMedia software that comes with the camera is a pretty weak brew.  It starts with a gratuitous slide show that I find completely pointless and time-consuming to bring up (for no reason, since these aren't your pictures!).  Aside from downloading images, it's almost useless in my opinion.  The Photo Editor software that comes with your PC is more capable.  Also, a USB interface isn't standard - heresy in 2000 computer peripherals.  Bizarre interfaces and poor PC software aside, the D-490 is a superb digital camera!

The camera case, while at first appearing to be some sort of plastic is really a surprisingly good quality metal, perhaps aluminum.  Olympus never compromises, you buy this camera with a feeling of confidence that the lens apparatus is of the highest optical quality, an invisible quality perhaps neglected by most other manufacturers, with the possible exception of Canon.That said, your pictures come out true to life.  And I was pleasingly surprised by the quality of the indoor photos I received which were in most cases just as good without the flash as with it.  The color is always good and with the multitude of software available (I ended up with eight CD's without even having bought a software package, everything, even the photo paper comes with one) you can make the color even more vibrant if you wish!Now on to the cons.  The sliding lens cap gets alarmingly close to but in my case always stops just short of hitting the extended lens before it slides in by itself before you can close it all the way, but it is by the smallest of margins!  I am supposing that they've tested this, and there is definitely a click stop, but I wouldn't want to accidentally 'slam' it one day.As a final note, there is one item neglected in an otherwise nearly perfect instruction manual.TO ACCESS SHG-TIFF:  You must hold the up arrow for two seconds as I found out only from an Amazaon review!

The first digital camera I had was a Polaroid PDC 640. The reason I first looked at the Olympus D-490Z is it also used the same Smartmedia cards. Smartmedia cards are credit card thin, they are cheaper than compactflash, and I was already familiar with them. The main reason why I wanted a new digital camera was zoom capabilities which my former camera did not have. The highlights of this camera are: 2.1 Megapixel, autofocus 3X optical zoom, 2.5X digital zoom, 6 mode flash, Quicktime movie mode, it's compact size, color LCD TFT display, and Smartmedia compatibility. The lowest picture quality is 640 by 480 and the highest is 1024 by 768. There is also a panoramic picture mode. This feature assists you in stitching images together. But, if you want to utilize this mode you have to use Olympus brand Smartmedia cards. This is a menu driven camera with two discre!et menus. All camera options such as exposure, simulated film speed, resolution, and flash modes can be operated through these menus. These options also give this digital camera the feel of a filbm camera. The flash that is mounted on the body of the camera is slightly confusing to use. This is because you have to manually pop-up the flash before the camera can choose to use it when taking the picture. If you do not manually pop-up the flash, the camera cannot use it when photographing. What I found particularly unusual about this camera was that when using the zoom feature the lens moves inside of a housing. This means that you can mount an additional lens onto the outside of it. I have purchased an additional lens which allows me to do extreme close ups. The camera has a feature to do \"macro\" shots, but this lens allows me to get even closer and take pictures of matchbox cars, insects, and flowers. I was considering other cameras in the Olympus D-400 !series, however this was the only one with the ability to do Quicktime movies lasting up to 15 seconds in high quality mode. I didn't think I would use this feature because there is another mode that the camera has called sequential shooting. But, for some moving objects that I tried to capture with my camera, I was unsuccessful using sequential shooting. The length between captures is too large for fast moving objects. Using this \"movie\" mode makes it easier and quicker. The only negative about movie mode is that the flash does not work in this mode. This camera gives you the greatest ability to change parameters, but continues to be a fully automatic point and shoot camera. Since I have purchased this camera, Olympus has come out with a D-500 series camera, which has a higher digital zoom, but the camera itself appeared to be made of cheaper materials. I strongly suggest reviewing the manual that comes with this camera as you really can't operate the camera sucessful!ly without reading it. As for a suggestion for the other reviewers, I would recommend using some sort of adapter for transferring pictures to your computer. I use a 3 1/2\" disc adapter that lets me avoid using the supplied software.", "Date": "July 3, 2001"}, {"Title": "easy and fun to use", "Author": "Daniel T.

Before you buy it, (or more likely if you've just bought it), you need to know a couple of things. 1. The hole for the tripod is offset to the extreme left of the camera, so the little \"traveller's tripods\" aren't safe to use with this camera unless you're very careful. 2. Only buy Olympus brand smart-media, otherwise you can't access the panorama function (if this is important to you.) 3. Never format the Smart-media card - just do a \"delete-all\". 4. It appears that all of the Smart-media floppy adapters that you can buy come from one company - Smartdisk.  They have driver software ([...]) that works with Windows 2000 that doesn't come in the box. (If you choose to buy a floppy adapter.) 5. I use 1500 mAhr NiMH batteries from Kodak - they're great.  The kodak battery charger is also awesome - it comes with 4 different plug types, and works with AC power from 100 to 240 Volts, and either 50 or 60 Hz.  Pretty much covers the civilised world. (and the USA too ;-)) 6. Accessing uncompressed mode is not mentioned anywhere in the manual.  You do it by selecting the mode one down (eg SHQ to go to SHQ-TIFF), and then press the up arrow and HOLD IT DOWN for more than a few seconds. Leaving this out of the manual was a blunder. 7.  The Camedia Master software is pretty ordinary, with one exception --- the digital panorama function works better than you can ever imagine, even without a tripod.  With a tripod it's perfect. 8.  I have managed to confuse my camera once - popping the batteries out and then putting them back in was enough to get around that. 9.  If the camera is zoomed when you close the lens cover, it makes more of that annoying grinding noise than usual, but it doesn't seem to be a real problem. 10. The camera's focus system works by looking for vertical lines - if you don't have any, to get really perfect focus you need to hold the camera sideways (presuming that there are horizontal lines in your picture), half press the button to hold the focus, and then rotate the camera back to normal.  In practice, the pictures usually come out very good without going to any extra trouble. 11. This camera is not the smallest, but it is a comfortable size.  My previous camera was a tiny APS camera, and I had trouble holding that one steady while pressing the shutter button. Ideally, you should hold a camera in your hands before you buy it.  Then buy it at the best price.The conclusion is that I like my camera.  It is good enough to justify the price, even when you include the extra money that I paid for the extra memory card, batteries, battery charger, and floppy disk adapter (adds up to about 50% more.)

With the 2.1 megapixel generation, I started to consider that idea. The first item that I started looking for was a company that already in the photo business (like Kodak, Olympus, Nikon and etc). After that, I wanted a camera that had the look of a standard camera and was as easy to use as a film camera. I'm not a professional user, then I needed a point-and-shoot camera. After a loooooooooooong research, I got this EXCELENT product. The quality is amazing! As good as a normal camera. Besides the features of recording short quicktime movies and panoramic photos (and it's fairly easy! I got it right at once!). If you can complain about this camera you can complain about two things: the Flash is not really automatic. You need to open it, it does not pop by itself. After open, then the camera uses if it's needed or not. Another point is the conection; it's a paralel connection and not USB. With the free Smarmedia reader that Olympus is offering, this problem is solved.If you're planning on buying a point-and-shoot camera that anybody can use without any trouble and that takes picture with GREAT quality, consider this camera.", "Date": "May 2, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Andrew H.

The Movie feature is a fun gimmick.  So is the ability to plug directly into a T.V. to view the photos as a slide show. The camera is small, which makes it easy to take along.  Fits in a jacket pocket.  I like the lens cover, and the unit seems sturdy. I am looking forward to getting the USB reader in the mail.  Downloads with the serial port take too long.

I have gotten 250+ shots (more than one 128MB card's worth of pictures at high res) on a single recharge of my NiMH recharagable batteries.  Maybe 50% of the time with flash.

My main reason for purchasing the camera was because of the reviews on the quality of picture for a 2.1 megapixel camera (and comparisons to higher MP cameras for that matter) and I must say I am impressed.  Since many people had listed pro's and cons in their reviews, I was prepared when I received the camera.  I find I carry the camera with me whenever I can and in two months I'm still using the original set of batteries after taking more than 150 pictures.  Whenever possible I use the AC adapter and it was well worth the money spent.  Since downloads take a while and I haven't received the free USB reader, I use it frequently.  I also download all my pictures on to a VHS tape before putting them on the computer.  Great option for sending copies of pictures to family members who don't have a computer and saves on printing costs.  I have a HP 932 printer and am extremely happy with the prints.I have used the camera in many situations including flourescent light and in bars.  I am totally impressed with the pictures in both situations using different camera settings to adjust the light balance to get the best picture.  It's also handy to have the ability to work with ISO and brightness features to get good pictures when you can't or don't want to use flash.  Unless you really need to change it, the HQmode (1600x1200) is perfect for printouts.  You can always change to 640x480 with the software for e-mails, although I tend to use Adobe photoshop or Microsoft PictureIt rather than the Camedia software that came with the camera.With all electronic items, you need to take the time to learn how to use them to avoid frustrations.  I sat down with the manual and read through every option while trying it on the camera.  This camera has so many great options and for the price of (PRICE)I am more than pleased.  I purchased the camera, 32 MB card (which I have yet to use as I tend to download pictures as soon as I can), case, adapter and warranty for (PRICE)and think it was well worth the money.  The 8 MB card that came with the camera takes 19 pictures in HQ mode and think along with that and the 32MB card, I should be ready for most situations.Overall, the camera is an excellent product taking into the consideration what other reviewers have listed as cons (many of which I don't consider cons - if all electronics were perfect for everyone, there wouldn't be competition).

For the 400.00+ I spent on this baby 2 years ago (and yeah, i know the prices have come way down)..I would have expected this thing to last longer than it has.

Some other nifty features: red eye reduction flash, rapid fire sequence shooting, makes small videos at 15 frames per second, video output jack, comes with decent software.Cons: Only two resolutions to choose from: 1600x1200 and 640x480.  An intermediate resolution would have been nice (of course, you can resize the images on your computer).  User interface is okay but could be better (sometimes confusing - you get different menus when the camera is open vs. when it is closed, and the menus aren't that intuitive).  I needed an hour with the manual, and I'm not all that stupid.  No USB connection, and the serial cable is really REALLY slow (but there are alternatives, like the USB reader and the Flash Path adapter).Conclusion: This is an excellent mid-level digicam.

Brown", "ReviewID": "R26E9S7N41RRXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an avid amateur photographer and bicyclist. After many years using an Olympus OM-1 SLR, I wanted a light camera to put in my backpack and I wanted freedom from processing of film. My only hesitation was the loss of lens interchangability that was a feature of the SLR.Now, after a year of constant use, I am sorry I didn't make the move to this digital camera earlier. It has been riding with me daily and is always ready to pop out and shoot. The case is getting a little scratched but I've taken care to protect the LCD viewing surface, though I find the optical viewfinder is fine for almost all my photos, with the exception of close up shots (macros).I've dropped the camera a foot onto a carpeted floor with no ill effects. Very occasionally it will refuse to operate but I've found the difficulty is with either weak batteries or poor battery contact, both of which are easily remedied. The lithium cells supplied seem to work forever but are not rechargeable. Alkaline batteries will not work in chilly (less than 50 degree) temperatures. The best batteries I've found for price vs. performance are nickel metal hydride rechargeables. The camera uses lots of current, so if you take many shots in a short time, especially if the flash and LCD screen are used, the batteries will become warm. As a long time 35mm film user I was concerned about color quality and sharpness. No need to worry. Picture quality is outstanding and excellent 8x10 prints are easily obtained with the standard \"HQ\" setting that has some compression and allows 16 shots with a 8MB memory card. This setting also produces excellent photos for PC wallpaper when reduced from the 1600x1200 native size to 1024x768 for PC's. The Camedia software that comes with the camera is adequate but if you do lots of photo work I'd recommend a graphics program for ease of picture manipulation and titling. Light sensitivity is amazing and nighttime shots without flash (tripod required) produce excellent results when the sensitivity is set to ISO 400. The flip up flash is great because you can be sure the flash will not go off simply by leaving it folded down. Sunrise/sunset shots come out very well on full automatic. The ability to use \"spot\" light metering will turn a dark subject against a light background into a very nice picture and fill flash is always available to help. Auto white balance makes adjusting for inside or outside light a memory. For almost all situations this camera really is point and shoot and I've caught many scenes that would have left me fumbling with my old manual SLR and lenses. I couldn't be more pleased with the D490.

Even on the middle grade mode, clarity, and color are pretty remarkable. Now the not so good news: the designers need to just plain go back to school. Here is the short list: 1. Quirky software: Camedia is poorly laid out, and does not work dependably each time. Sometimes you can download pictures, other times no go, the clock just runs forever. I've switched the software to different computers, restarted cam, restarted computers, no consistency. It ran once for half and hour with no download. Worse, the programmers weren't bright enough to put an escape function when this happens, which means you have force quit Camedia to try again. When the camera does mount on your desktop successfully, the file names are nonsensical. What is \"DCIM\" or \"IMOLYM\"? The programmers must have been in brain jail not to think of a more user friendly way to name the files on your camera. The controls for rotation, enlargement, etc. are crude but they do work, though poorly. One would think that the software engineers would adopt more user friendly conventions ala Adobe Acrobat or Photoshop, industry standard conventions at this point. 2. Shoddy construction: from top to bottom, nearly every moving part of this camera seems on the verge of breaking, when used normally. Many reviewers have mentioned the cover, so I won't repeat this comment. The battery compartment cover design is awful, you truly feel that you may damage it permanently, simply by closing it with batteries loaded. The outport cover, (this is where the output lines for connecting to a TV or PC are located) This is held on my a tiny flimsy looking rubbery hinge. Scary. However, good news: the flash mem card cover IS sturdy! 3. Ergonomics: again, the designers need to wake up and smell the coffee. Really! One control that you will find yourself using over and over is the monitor button (turns on and off the little LCD monitor in the back). This button is located in an area that is just awkward to access repeatedly. Try it, you can do it, but it's not a natural movement or location. Another button frequently used is the \"menu\" button. The designers locate this button right next to the monitor button. Same shape and almost same icon. The result, one has to be careful which button to press, they are so similar. Hey guys, how about a different shape, or color? Or a different icon. Geeez, come on! 4. The control functions on the monitor are complex, but fairly workable with practice. Still, there are many features and selections, and one wonders why it's not laid out to be more user friendly. Conclusion: I know this cam has gotten good reviews here, but I think that the reviewers are either much brighter then myself, or very easy to please. I tend to think the latter.", "Date": "March 25, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - costs more than you think", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R13PP1U5ONAR67", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first experience with a digital camera and I am very impressed.  Part of my decision to purchase this camera was the reasonable cost, but it didn't really turn out that way.  By the time I bought the extra card, the adapter, the case, the recharage batteries, it ended up costing $200 more.  Unfortunately, it will now cost me another $50 or so because the Camedia software that comes with the camera is, in my opinion, only good for viewing the pictures on your computer.  It's ability to print multiple shots and resize your pictures for printing is very poor.  The red eye reduction feature doesn't even work.  I called tech support and was told it only works if the color is a true fire engine red in the eye.  Well, I guess the eyes I photograph have a slight hint of orange in them, so it doesn't work.  Oh, well!  I'm looking at the Corel Photo-Paint 9 Digital Camera edition software or the Microsoft PictureIt.  I'll probably go with Corel, based on the great reviews.Isn't this site great?

I'm still getting the USB card reader, since is supposed to load faster! The print quality with the software that came with the camera is incredible. This camera will never compete with  $1,000. 35MM setup for resolution, but for what I use it for, it is a five star value at Amazon's price! This camera will pay for itself in about 6 months with the savings on film and developing! My next purchase is the printer that Olympus makes for digital cameras.

Great for taking those candid shots... no one realizes you are using the camera!The only negative thing I can say about it is the way it turns on & off.

It's light, easy to use, fast, and straight forward.  The lens is protected by a sliding door.  This is kind of cool.  You open the sliding door to turn the camera on in \"capture\" mode.  When you open the sliding door, a motor extends the lens out from the body about .5 inches.  This is all great.  HOWEVER, to power off the camera and return to \"review\" mode, you slide the door part-way shut.  The problem is, if you're not extremely careful, the door jams into the extended lens, and the lens _skids_ back into the body against the door.  Once the lens is fully retracted, you can close the door completely.I gave it two stars because all the goodness of this camera will be useless when your lens motor burns out because the lens was rubbing against the door.The Camera's great, but it's door/power switch design has much to be desired.  I will be returning this camera.", "Date": "November 28, 2000"}, {"Title": "Good but has problems.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1GLAKZV9E1DUY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great pictures, but following problems were encountered.Very short battery life.Software problems (tech help was very good but still took 1/2 hour to fix).Oddly designed lens door causes lens to jam while camera powers down.In summery, this is what I would call a Microsoft type product, When working, and when the software is not crashing, it will satisfy and take great pictures for its roughly ($) price tag.", "Date": "January 26, 2002"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2.1-megapixel CCD for prints at sizes up to 8 x 10 inches\nUses standard SmartMedia cards; 8 MB card included\n3x optical zoom\nQuickTime movie mode\nContinuous shooting rate of 1.3 frames per second", "Name": "Olympus D-490 2.1MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J4FXA0DNL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00004WHE5"}}
