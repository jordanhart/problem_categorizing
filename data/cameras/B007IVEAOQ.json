Main items for me were the camera, memory, batteries, filters and charger. No problem. The rest of the items were very poor in quality. The tripods were very low cost and quality. The camera bag was next to useless - one big center cavity with one seperator and no side pockets at all. I have no regrets buying this as I have a tripod and bag. Price was good.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "I was very pleased with the prompt delivery.", "Author": "Imtiaz A.", "ReviewID": "R3AIGHX9JV03QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent camera.
