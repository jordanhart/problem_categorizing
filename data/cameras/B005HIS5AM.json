{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lens missing and cheap quality bag", "Author": "Pritraj", "ReviewID": "RFJ92H1IGP5JZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera last week, no doubt the camera is awesome and one of the best in the price range, the reason I'm giving 3 rating is because of the seller. When i opened the box, .45x lens were missing and it was a surprise to see the lenses were in back order. If that was the case the seller should have intimated at the time of purchase or at-least before shipping. When I contacted the seller, I was told it will take 2 weeks for lens to arrive plus the shipping time. I'm still waiting for my lens.Secondly the bag is of the cheapest quality one can find in the market, I would avoid carrying such an expensive camera in a cheap bag and risk a fall.Basically the bag is cheap and also the extra battery is of some cheap quality, not the OEM canon battery.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "In a word, Awesome.", "Author": "ktward", "ReviewID": "R2I5VTVWJ5W55J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Technically, I can't call myself a \"professional\" photographer because I've never personally sold my work-- though as a graphic designer and Advertising/Marketing Manager, my work has indeed been utilized professionally.I have been an avid and artistic photography amateur for decades, starting with the Canon AE-1 Program that I received as a wedding gift way back in 1983. (Amusingly, it was a gift from my new brothers-in-law at the behest of my new husband, but it was I who wielded it from Day One until it finally gave up the ghost some 20 years later. I clung to that camera longer than I did that husband.)The T3i exceeds all of my expectations. The Program mode is super convenient and superbly intuitive for times when I don't feel like futzing around with settings--like when my college-aged kids recently visited me for Winter Vaca here in Puerto Rico. But when I'm scouting on my own with both tripod and time on my hands, I have every customizable bell & whistle I could ever want immediately at hand. Nikon's good, no question, but Canon's utility and lenses rock.All of that said, after considerable research I knew that I wanted the T3i (more affordable but in every way that matters equally as functional as the pricier Canon models) well before I ran across Cameta Camera on Amazon. All I can say is that they offered not only the best kit prices that I found, but also a uniquely diverse range of kits to suit any enthusiast's particular needs.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product....not happy with the seller", "Author": "NB \"Michigan Man\"", "ReviewID": "R2XTQFZHHA7XLT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this item from Cameta Camera. The product is excellent and the bundle is great. All the accessories seem to be pretty good. But the bundle came with one lens missing. On checking the shipping sheet, it said that that lens was on back order. I wish I had known when I placed my order. This is deception of the worst kind. I am very displeased with the seller.

This bundled package that cost less than the two lenses and camera body combined just made it so much sweeter. Granted most of the bundled items are cheap knock offs, but you are practically getting them for free so I can\u2019t complain. The memory card is a necessity and the remote shutter something I would have bought anyway. The memory card reader works well if you don\u2019t have a card reader port on your computer otherwise its useless. I haven\u2019t tried the flash and may never will because the built in flash seems to do everything I need. The bag, spare battery, cleaning kit (q-tips), and lcd protectors and UV filters are a nice perk. The additional (precision design) lenses that screw onto the canon lenses are fun to play with for a day but I will probably never use them again. Moral of the story: The Canon Camera  (camera comes will battery, charger, and electrical cords), two entry level base models lenses, remote shutter, UV filters and memory card are worth more than the price of the bundle. Everything else is great fun to play with and nice to have but mainly cheap quality products  to help persuade you to make the purchase.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with speedy service", "Author": "MissM", "ReviewID": "R2TQG055RZCAV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera package deal thru Amazon on Tuesday and got it 2 days later.

I was originally a little bit skeptical about the camera bag and extra battery, but both seem to be of sufficient quality. The battery may \"feel\" slightly cheaper than the Canon battery that comes in the T3i box, but works to the same degree nonetheless. I haven't put the cleaning kit or the SD card reader to the test (no need to - my computer has an SD reader built in), but will update if I do use them. NOTE: The SD card reader I received from my seller (Cameta Camera) was the Zeikos USB 2.0 reader, not the white one pictured in the bundle. The shutter release remote, flash, telephoto and macro lenses, screen protectors, UV filters, memory card wallet, lenses, and the camera itself have so far exceeded my expectations.The only thing I would recommend to the sellers is that instead of including 2 UV filters, add an extra $5-10 to the bundle and send the Vivitar 58mm lens filter kit with UV, Polarizer, and Fluorescent filters.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon T3i plus accessories", "Author": "GeneJim", "ReviewID": "R2FNXFON88XS4Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is great, generally, but has some strange quirks--examples: having to cover the eyepiece when self-timing, and, in most modes, having it autofocus on the nearest object (even if not the object of interest). Making the various settings are too complicated--Canon needs to have a point and shoot expert work on simplifying them--and many (most?) of the settings are unnecessary. The 18-55 mm lens needs to be sharp enough at all focal lengths that full size pictures are not degraded; the 75-300 mm lens does not seem to have this defect, but it is not an IS (shake reducing) lens. ISO 400 is as good as ISO 100, and the 3200 and 6400 ISO images are surprisingly good. The auxiliary 2.5x lens gives sharp images in the center of the field but that drops off quickly and sharply away from center. I was never able to get the auxiliary wide angle lens to screw into the front of either lens, so I doubt that I'll ever use either. Remote control works only with 10 second self-timer. Other items seem fine. Haven't used the extra flash yet but have put the filters on both lenses. Extra battery is welcome. I wish I had bought the camera with the 18-135 mm regular lens or a telephoto lens with focal length overlapping the 18-55 mm lens.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT VALUE.....GREAT ITEM!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "onemssassy", "ReviewID": "RTGJBD76GA2FM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely LOVE this package.

I will not hesitate to purchase from Cameta again.Me: I got into photography while serving with USAF in Germany in the 1970\u2019s.  I have a Pentax SLR and several thousand$ of Takumar lenses, as well as the full suite of B&W; developing equipment. I\u2019m as antique as my Pentax and I\u2019m not a professional \u2013 my wife exhibits better composition ability with her point-and-shoot.  I\u2019ve been through at least a dozen P&S; cameras over the last 20 years, most in the $300-500 range, and still carry one in my pocket when a DSLR is just too big.  I wanted to get back into the SLR realm with the changeable lenses, increased creativity potential, and my favorite attribute \u2013 really shallow DEPTH OF FIELD!The Kit: The T3i is an excellent DLSR for me. It has more automatic and manual functionality than I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 and the Canon suite of lenses and accessories should satisfy the novice as well as the professional, and everyone in-between \u2013 and their respective wallet$.The lenses are very good Canon lenses \u2013 as is most of the kit.  However, the flash unit while usable, doesn\u2019t \u201ctalk\u201d to the T3i.  You have to set the flash manually.  I bought the Canon SpeedLite 320EX from Cameta ($149 delivered).The 2x Telephoto adapter does NOT work with the 75-300 lens. (it won\u2019t focus MF or AF).  When I emailed Cameta, they responded almost immediately with the phone number of their customer service guy, Rich.  I left a message and Rich called me back within an hour, explaining that the included instructions indicated the 2x adapter would not work with the longer lenses AND he offered to refund that portion of my purchase. ($28 for the .45 & 2x pair).The case, card, battery, filters, and remote are all of good quality and function as expected.Unless you\u2019re already an expert professional, I recommend reading David Busch\u2019s \u201cCanon EOS Rebel T3i/600D Guide to Digital SLR Photography\u201d. It\u2019s 455 pages and affords the reader the ability to dive as deep as you want into the features & functions of the T3i.So after a few weeks, several basketball games, and over 3,000 shots, if I had it to do over again, I\u2019d certainly buy the T3i fromCameta, but I\u2019d look for a slightly different kit \u2013 because I won\u2019t be using the flash or the lens adapters.PJ", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "RandallM \"RandallM\"", "ReviewID": "R2OOP3XKTSC2OD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price you can't beat this camera.

I still need to learn to use all the features on this camera but it is easy to start with and can do much more complex things as I learn more.  I love the 300 zoom. The flash can be used off the camera which I was not aware of.  I have an old cannon rebel eos 35 mm film camera that was the first fully automatic and fully manual camera they made.  My old lens fits and works on my new camera so I am happy to have a 3rd lens I can use.  I was not sure it would work, but the autofocus from the older camera works on this one.
