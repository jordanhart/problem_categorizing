{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good - But understand the limitations", "Author": "P. S. Ross", "ReviewID": "R1KRGEHBSVWJLP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this GE Home Security starter kit and several of the add ons to put in a security system to help protect our home.  I've been fairly pleased, but there are a couple of issues to be aware of.  In order to give my review a bit of structure, I'll attempt to break it down by component...including a couple of components that ARE NOT included in this basic kit, but that you may need to purchase to get the system to work, or elect to purchase to expand the system.1.  The conroller.  The controler is small, easy to program and makes heck of a racket when the alarm system is triggered.  My only slight complaint with the conroller is it does not include any provision to be wall mounted and it has limited range (more on that under \"door/window sensor below\".  Turning the system on or off from the control pad is very easy.  Each of first 3 zones can handle up to 4 sensors, allowing you to say, put all 4-exterior doors on Zone 1, and windows on zones 2 and 3.  To do this, obviously you have to get more hardware than comes with the basic kit reviewed here.2.  Door/Window sensor.  The advantage of the wireless door/window sensor is the ease of installation.  A wired system would require many hours of running wires from each sensor to the controller to function.  This is not practical in many instances.  The wireless sensors are easy to place using a couple of screws to mount the contact plate and some double sided tape to mount the sensors themselves.  Programming the controller to recognize the sensor is also easily accomplished.  However, be aware that the sensors have limited range...in some cases VERY limited range.  In my installation, 2 sensors located near the front of the house would not communicate all the time with the control box.  Another reviewer talked about how his control box will flash, reporting a low battery in a sensor, when in fact the battery isn't low.  Well...the reason the controller is flashing is because it is not getting a good signal from the sensor.  It cannot differentiate between a low battery and a poor signal.  So, it will flash repeatedly and the documentation says that means \"low battery\" but it can also mean the sensor is too far from the controller.  In my situation, my 2 sensors were only about 40-feet from the controller and I had this issue...so beware when GE sasy \"up to 150 feet\".  If you have an issue, you will need one or more \"range extenders\" which are not included in the basic kit.  However, I had to buy one so I reviewed it below.My other issue with the sensor is how hard it is to take them apart to change the battery (at least once every 2-years per GE).  The tabs on the side would seem to indicate a screwdriver can be used to take them apart, but they are too flimsy to do that.  The only way I was able to get mine apart was to use a razor knife as a prying tool (kind of dangerous) to get the case apart and get to the battery.  I see no way to replace the batteries without removing the sensors from the door frame...and they are secured with double sided tape, not screws...so that's going to be an issue in the future.  GE needs to redesign the catches that hold the sensor body together.  The ones I had apart, I shaved the tabs down to make them easier to get back apart later.3.  Range Extender -  This deal plugs into an unused wall socket (tying it up forever) and will simply \"repeat\" any signals it recieves from sensors around it, hopefully communicating all the way back to the controller, so that sensors that can't otherwise function reliably will now begin working properly.  It works, in a fashion, but be aware that the Range Extender itself still has a very short range.  In my case, I was able to find a spot to plug it in half way between the front of the house and the controller that was close enough to the sensors to work and close enough to the controller to work.....it seemed to need to be within 15 feet of the sensors and 25 feet of the controller.  I have NO IDEA if you can chain one range extender after another.4.  Window Decals and Yard Sign.  I read up on this and most \"experts\" say that putting in decals and a yard sign are your biggest deterents to simple home break ins.  None of what I'm talking about here is going to keep a determined thief from stealing your Monet, but maybe it will keep the doper kids down the block from targeting your house for meyhem if they need some money to buy more dope.  I went with an extra pack of sticky stickers and put one on most of my windows and all of my doors.  The yard sign?  It is so flimsy it broke trying to take it out of the package.  If I was GE, I'd be ashamed to have my name on it.  It's a flimsy piece of plastic junk.  I taped mine together with some clear tape and then couldn't get the plastic stake to drive into the yard, as it is so cheap and flimsy.  Get the picture?5.  Other Sensors available.  A motion detector and a water sensor are available.  I didn't get them so I can't comment really.6.  What isn't available.  To my knowledge, you can't get any sort of dialer with this alarm system.  Also, no home monitoring is included.  To that extent this system represents a definite comprimise in security.  To get it working, you are going to have to lay out some money, but you don't have an ongoing monitoring charge from a home security company.  The comprimise, your home won't be as secure as it would be with a really top notch, monitored system.7.  Remote Siren - The remote siren is really loud and hopefully, being remote from the controller, will increase the chances that a passing neighbor will hear the alarm and take notice of the strange white van sitting in the driveway.  It needs a receptical of its own and is also (I'm sure) limited in range.  Mine would take a bit to find and disable...but that may not be too much of an issue for a thief as I summarize below.OK...So...if I'm a thief and I'm not detered by the flimsy hard sign and the decals, I'm going to go right up to your house and bust open a door or window.  IF that door or window is equipped with a sensor, there's really good chance it's going to trip an alarm.  If you have the system set to \"HOME\" that means the alarm is going to go off immediately emitting a very loud (if your close to it) noise...that would alert anyone in the house and MAYBE someone outside of an intrusion.  But honestly, that's a big Maybe.  The determined thief now can follow his ears to the control box and disable it with a hammer (or even under heel) to little bits.  That WILL make the alarm quit sounding.  If you have the system set to \"AWAY\" it will just start beeping when triggered allowing the thief 45 seconds to enter the code to disarm it.  Obviously he doesn't know the code so he'll just crush it to bits, again disabling the system.  I've figured out a way to set my system to \"HOME\" even when I'm away.  If you can figure out a way to exit your house without setting off a sensor, you can do the same thing.This system, again, does represent good value, but the best you can hope for is the thief isn't \"determined\" and hopefully will go on down the street to the next house that has no alarm.  You might consider putting in a yard sign from one of the \"major\" security providers to go along with this system.  That would probably be an improvement.  Even better would be a high-dollar WIRED system with home monitoring, but it's going to cost you a lot more and be more of a hassle.  I've been called in the middle of the night at least 10 times when my mother's monitored home security system has been accidently triggered...so I know there are hassles going that way too.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for a low budget system.", "Author": "Carolina Yankee", "ReviewID": "R3INY20S6GTX1P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As my title says, the system is great for the price. But the biggest reason I gave it only 3 stars is because of one really stupid design flaw that could have easily been avoided with one simple mute switch.As others have mentioned, the problem is while the system is giving the 45 second delay after a sensor has been triggered to give you time to disable it, it gives off very loud beeps with no option to mute it or at least turn it down. The problem here is obvious. If the intruder has any determination at all, all he has to do is follow the beeping sounds to your system and smash it to bits before the alarm goes off. Yes, I know he can still do that after the alarm goes off, but most intruders are going to take off when suddenly and unexpectantly a very loud alarm goes off. I understand that many people like an audible reminder that their alarm has been triggered so that they will remember to turn it off. But how hard would it have been to give me the option to turn the beeps off? I would rather take my chances on maybe occasionally forgetting that I have my alarm system on and letting the alarm go off, than directing an intruder straight to my system so he can disable it.Here's how I worked around that problem. I located the base unit in my storage room in my garage locked up behind a door that swings out.(can't easily be kicked in) Also convenient for when we drive up into the garage, we simply go into the storage room to disarm it without triggering the system and then have to beat the clock. In this location, if the intruder is in the house he won't hear the beeps. If he breaks into the garage, he can hear them but he still won't be able to get to it. At least not in 45 seconds, if at all. You might be thinking, what good is the alarm siren if it's muffled out in your storage room? To get around that, I added 3 separate alarm sirens. One mounted high on a wall where it is not easy to get to in the main part of my house. The other two in the attic facing directly out the gable vents. Now I have plenty of indoors and outside siren coverage. A big added benefit to adding a separate siren is once the alarm goes off but a very persistent intruder still destroys the base unit, the separate siren(s) will continue to go off independently from the base unit. If you locate them where he can't get to them as I did, he won't be able to shut them up. Even if he is able to pull the power cord, it has battery back-up. You can add as many as you want to maximize coverage area and/or loudness. I had to wear ear muffs while testing mine.Now for another common complaint and somewhat of a work around. The motion sensors only work in the \"Away\" mode. Their logic behind this is when you have it in \"Home\" mode you can walk around your alarm coverage area without setting off the alarm, while all other sensors (doors, windows, etc) will still instantly set off the alarm. Again, why not have a simple \"Ignore motion sensors\" option switch, so that otherwise, the motion sensors will also instantly set off the alarm like all the other sensors. The only work around I came up with for this problem will only work as an alert and not a full alarm. Simply put the system into \"Test\" mode then put the switch on the side to off (lights only), chime, or alert (multiple beeps depending on zone triggered). Set up like this the motion sensors will work like all the others. Two points to remember when in test mode and depending on motion sensors for instant alerts. One, the system will automatically cancel out of test mode and return to normal operation after 5 hours, so if you want to keep it set up that way you have to remember to keep putting it back into test mode within every 5 hours. Two, also remember that once a motion sensor detects movement, it has to see NO movement for about 20 seconds to reset itself to be ready to detect again. In other words, for example, if someone walks by and triggers it, then 15 seconds later someone else walks by, the second person will not be detected. Or if there's continuous movement like tree limbs moving in the wind, it won't be able to reset itself. It has to have that 20 second \"no movement\" time period to reset itself. This issue doesn't matter for triggering a full alarm because once it senses that first time, the 45 second countdown is on.One other thing concerning the motion sensors that someone else wrote about that I also experienced, suggesting that it must be a common problem. The battery connector, specifically the positive side, wasn't making a good connection, causing the sensor to intermittently work or not at all. To check for this and fix it, connect just the positive side to see if it feels lose. If it is, disconnect and then carefully bend the sides of the connector in so that it will then snap on tighter.The other common complaint that I will back up is the 150 ft. range claim. Even though that may technically be true in a perfect line-of-site no obstructions condition, in real world conditions it's highly exaggerated. If this is a problem, the only thing you can do is make sure the sensor batteries aren't weak, add signal repeaters, or move the base around to different locations until you find one that works.Finally, battery replacement in the magnetic switches is another issue. If you use the double sided tape to mount the switch, when it comes time to replace the battery you're going to have to rip the sensor lose from the tape, no doubt messing up the tape and probably pulling paint off. Although I haven't had to do it yet, I've read that it's also a pain to snap the cover off to access the battery.With all this said you're probably wondering why I gave it 3 stars. Here's why. For less than $200 I have the base unit, 3 sirens, 2 motion sensors, and a magnetic sensor. The system was very easy to set up and operate and is working great for my situation. I also like how easy it is to make the complete system as small or as big as you want it to be, depending on your needs and budget. And as I said at the beginning of this review, the only reason I gave it only 3 stars is for the really stupid countdown beeps with no option to turn them off. Considering the price, I have no problem with having to figure out work-arounds or living with the flaws I can't do nothing about. Otherwise, I could spend a lot more money on a different system and it will probably also have some design flaws and glitches.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "I \"Hacked\" the Control Center- here's how you can too...", "Author": "G. Todd", "ReviewID": "R1S7I3FFUDMO7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got done installing the Choice Alert system in our 1600 square foot split foyer. The components include the control center, one signal booster, one extra siren module, 3 door/ 3 window sensors, one garage door sensor, one signal repeater, and one motion sensor. Obviously, I don't yet have much experience with its performance, but I thought I'd share some installation thoughts.Certainly the biggest problem is-  what keeps an intruder from just unplugging/ taking the batteries out/ or just smashing the control center?  The warning beeps in the \"away\" mode are obvious enough and give the intruder enough time to home in on the sound.  My \"Hack\"?  I just opened the Control Center and snipped the wires to the beeper/ siren.  It works just fine like that, and it is totally silent until the siren module goes off.  The upside of doing this is obvious, the downsides are- 1.  You don't get the short beep when a door or window is opened when it is not armed (although I actually think that's a plus).  2.  You don't get the warning beeps when you come home- if you forget, it will go off.  3.  You have to buy a siren module.  4.  I suspect GE would void the warranty.  5.  You could mess up and snip the wrong wires.If you decide to try it, here's what I did.  I took the 3 screws on the back plus one in the battery compartment out.  At that point I still could not completely open it up- the right side would not release.  I pried the back open about an inch on the left side and examined it with a flashlight.  After being pretty sure I had the right wires (2 brown ones that disappear into the beeper module) I snipped them with a pair of scissors.  I then tested it and I got exactly what I wanted- total silence until the alarm sounds.  I installed the siren module on top of our kitchen cabinet and ran the wire from the plug outlet used for our over-the-range microwave (my wife's idea).  It is completely out of view.All of the sensor modules seem to work as advertised.  The most difficult part of the installation is getting the two sensor parts properly aligned on the doors.  It would be nice if GE would include some shims to raise the small part off of the door, but the don't so I had to cut some pieces of wood.All in all, I think the hacked system is a reasonable value for the money-  the sensors seem to work well and the siren would certainly scare someone off.  The non-hacked version has such a big problem with it giving the intruder 45 seconds to disarm it I would be hard pressed to recommend it.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great entry alarm product for the money", "Author": "Jason Oates", "ReviewID": "R1QQ3S6ZM74DMF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this product (and 4 separate door/window sensors) to assist in securing out house at night.  It was very easy to install and setup.  It does have the \"alarm and chime\" options for entry, although there is an \"off\" option that will only allow the unit to flash the light of the unit opening if you desire.  Once armed, the alarm is VERY loud. We actually used our firearms ear-protection to test all of the units once installed because it was so loud!The only downside is that if you were to use it similar to that of a \"Brinks\" or \"ADT\" system, meaning a delay so that you can enter/exit the building and have the alarm on a timed delay, there is limited availability of this.  Although it does feature this, it is audible and is limited to 45 seconds.  I would like to option of no audible notice of the timer and the ability to change/lessen the time.Overall, it is a wonderful product that will not hurt your wallet!", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "GE 45142 Choice Alert - OK, but in a very limited way.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2QALS2K1AYQI8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let's get it out right out there: the GE 45142 Choice Alert supports a max of 12 window/door sensors.  The package's reference to 16 sensors is clarified in the manual - only 12 of the units will trigger an intrusion alarm - the remaining 4 are for alerts, and trigger only a low key chime.  12 alarms will likely cover apartments, but houses with first floor and basement windows/doors may come up short.And that's the beginning of the good and bad of the Choice Alert.  Yes, you can easily add sensors without wires or hassel.  And yes, there are a nice selection of sensor types (door/windows, motion detectors, water detectors, garage door sensors).  And yes, the console organizes alarms into zones so you can quickly see where a problem is occurring.But then the \"buts\" begin.  4 zones, yes, BUT only 3 can be used to trigger intrusion alarms.  And each zone supports only 4 sensors.  4 sensors???  That's a pretty small zone.  They might as well have not bothered with the concept.Choice Alert works best as an intruder alert system. - an alarm to wake up residents in a house break-in scenario.  There is a house mode, and as soon as a sensor detects a problem, the alarm goes off.  It is a nice loud alarm, and if it's not enough, you purchase additional wireless alarm speakers that can be placed elsewhere in or outside the house.You can purchase a remote to disable or set the alarm when you are entering your own house.  If you don't purchase it, you'll have to set your console into Away mode, which gives you 45 seconds to key in a code that disables the alarm before it goes off.  45 seconds is a very long time - the unit beeps during this period, and it is sure bet that any intruder who heard it could quickly locate the console and smash it before it triggered the alarm.  Nope, the 45 seconds is not configurable.  Nope, the beeps are not configurable.  See some of the inventive work-arounds implemented by the reviewers.  I say buy the key chain remote and just set the alarm to Home mode after you close your front door.  No pause, no problems.Choice Alert claims it can reach sensors placed as far as 150 feet from the unit. My house is rather small, and have had no problem connecting to sensors in my basement and porch.  Other peer reviewers have had less success with relatively short distances.  Fortunately, the Choice Alert system does offer radio repeaters, that can be placed between the console and the problematic sensor.And a final note: the Choice Alert does not have the ability to call a number when the alarm is triggered.  You'll see this ability in many $100+ systems.The Choice Alert is a very basic, wireless alarm system.  It has cheap and extensible going for it.  Unlike other bargain systems, it has a well written manual, and a parent company I know will be around for a while (GE).  I bought unit principally to warn us of intruders when we're asleep in the house.  I think it will do that fine enough.  I'm not convinced it will do much as an away alarm.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Big Mistake", "Author": "Guy", "ReviewID": "R110H13MT9KL7Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As an Amazon Prime customer I buy many things from Amazon each year.

First, the product literature says this can communication up to 150 feet. Not on your life.  I bought accompanying motion sensors and door sensor kits and they can barely communicate 35 feet away (tested with multiple new batteries) through nothing more than two layers of drywall.  I did testing over a period of several days and found that the sensors had to be no further than 35 feet in either direction.  This means I had to position the base unit/control center in awkward locations (would not have been an issue if they could communication up to at least 50 feet but they don't).  Second, the sensors are said to be weather-resistant?  Not likely unless you're living in Florida.  Some of the sensors quite working when the temperature dipped below 35-40 degrees.  Third, the motion sensors are generally useless on channels 1-3 unless you set the unit to ALARM AWAY FROM HOME. I really did NOT expect that little nugget of uselessness.  Meaning - you can only use one channel to monitor motion without arming the system in an AWAY FROM HOME MODE.  And then.. here's the really bad part:  So they only function as expected when you're gone.  SO WHAT?  No one is there to hear the alarm then. This is really a badly thought out \"piece of junk\" system and someone at GE needs taken out back and whipped for this abomination.

Read many reviews before purchasing.. Most of the low reviews (on many security products) seem to come from people who don't understand that your not going to get a $500 system for $50.What This does? (and does NOT do).Does do!:- Full time NOTIFICATION center with ability to select from 3 different types of notification alerts (this is what the slide switch is for) 1) visual only/No sound = lights flash and no sound alert, 2) visual/chime = led's flash and 2 tone sound is played once, 3) visual/alert = led's flash and unit beeps every so often.If its plugged in (or on battery back up) it is considered to be in notify mode.. the alert type you select with the slide switch will continue until the sensor is closed. The mute button allows you to mute the notification (that's its basic use)- When \"Armed\" (home/away) the slide switch has no use at all and if an intruder slides the switch to off or hits the mute button they have no affect. Once armed it can only be destroyed or disarmed to stop it.*note: Most home and even professional systems have an entry/exit timer when set to \"away mode\"... Please stop complaining about it (or don't buy this system... OR try to find one without it.... good luck ;) ).. Again the issue is your not going to get $500 system with adjustable everything and unlimited range for $50- When Armed in \"Home\" mode... It assumes you may still wish to walk to the bathroom or around your house (so NO the motion sensors do not work)... That's SMART... Not stupid (sure the $500 system lets you set a schedule of events and even the sensitivity of motion sensors.. but this system is 10% of that cost.. So be happy to even get 60% of the features, this is actually a great little unit).In home mode ANY opened sensor will immediately get a response and closing the sensor has NO affect (Unlike cheap ones where if you close them they stop the alert).. You must destroy or disarm the base device. (or else RUN RUN RUN!!!!)- When Armed in \"Away\" mode the machine beeps for 45sec on exit so you can leave the house without setting off the alarm... and it beeps for 30sec on entry before going to full alert (which is ruthless loud btw). All sensors are active in away mode including motion sensorsThis is standard behavior for a security system of this type (in away mode).. Again you get what you pay for.___________________ Summary (and does not do:)This system is an absolute steal for the price these days. The ability to add up to 16 sensors across 4 zones makes this little box a big deal. ANY system can be defeated.. especially the $50 kind. (but if your neighbors have the $0 dollar kind... your house wont be the one robbed and that's the point).ANY security system (especially with added \"warning this house protected\" type signs) will reduce your chances of being a target.. That's all you can do.. reduce your chances.I can easily say this system is far above its price in value and piece of mind (need more piece of mind.... spend more money don't write 1 star review unless product is actually non working or faulty.. its misleading to the rest of us)This system works terrific as an alarm/alert system and I had no issues what so ever during set up or installation (and yes you WANT other people to hear your system arm itself in away mode.. that's a small daily audible deterrent to anyone in earshot who may be waiting for you to leave the house)What the system doesn't do:- Call/text/email alerts to your cell (Now your looking at a $100+ system)- 24hour surveillance (Again call ADT or similar and ask for a quote)- Adjustable sensors (the motion sensors work great for me.. just don't use cheap batteries)- Multi week scheduling... stuff like \"dawn to dusk\" settings are for the higher end systems (read: more $$$)So in short this is a \"dummy\" system to keep the dummies off of you.. get some signs and let them listen to you arm it everyday and they get the point (if you live in an apartment complex on that not perfect side of town... THIS IS FOR YOU... BUY NOW!!!)If you need a \"smart\" system and live in a really nice house in the suburbs (stop being cheap and writing bad reviews just call the right guys and pay the cost.. plus you get a deal on your insurance since your buying a REAL system)I guess Im just saying this is a terrific system for me at my level... BUT if you've got really nice stuff (statues and rare Russian eggs and epic 1 of a kind artwork).. just go buy the right system for your needs.I personally use a 2 tier set up where I have this as audible... and a set of wifi ip (nanny type) motion detector cam's. So while they search and destroy the audible part of my system (sorry choice alert) they actually trip the motion camera's and I get push notifications and email snapshots (right on my iphone).. So they can clear me out and burn the place down (me, the cops, and youtube will get the video baby!)Sooo you see its all about what and how you want to use it (but dummy systems always need overlaps or multiple tiers imho)... That said my system seems great to me and works every time I use it (its on notify mode 24hours a day here and doesn't miss a beat)..@ other Amazon reviewers: Please write honest reviews based on your personal experiences and stop writing 1 star reviews for items that you buy and didn't bother to read the box (unless they are actually faulty items this is misleading to other buyers).

The system performed OK but there were a few minor issues that I would like to share.  In reading the reviews, I read that battery replacement was a problem considering the Door/Window sensors are installed with double sided tape.  This prompted me to use 'velcro tape' to mount these sensors instead of the enclosed double sided tape.  This will permit easy removal enabling the battery replacement without the problem of tearing the double sided tape off the door. You will also find there is a learning curve to the removal of the back of the Door/Window Sensors, it is difficult.  Lastly, I found the Door/Window Sensor needed an adapter (which I made) when attaching to the door.  This is needed due to the door gap and/or location of the magnet on the door jam.  This adapter is helpful in maintaining the required 1/2 inch or less gap.  The adapter should be the size of the Door/Window Sensor plus an extra 1/2 inch in width.  The adapter attaches to the top of the door, (using the double sided tape)so that it bridges over the gap from the door jam.  You then attach the Door/Window Sensor to the adapter as close to the magnet as possible.  Keep in mind, use the 'velcro' when attaching the Door/Window Sensor to the adapter.  I found this to be a good solution the the battery replacement problem.Since the 45142 Control Center has no provision for wall mounting, use the 'Velcro tape\" here as well.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for the apartment", "Author": "rbmgf7", "ReviewID": "R3M76O9B69PCQ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently had an incident so that prompted me to get an alarm system. After spending a day searching online and in town, I came across this little gem.The wireless capabilities are great since running wires in a bare garage are noticeable. I installed the door/window sensor onto the garage door. You need to be wary what you install the door/window sensor onto since it's magnetic (the small part) controlled by a magnetic switch. The metal garage door interfered with the sensor so I had to distant it from the door. I also went ahead and purchased the motion sensor and additional alarm. I installed them in some discrete locations so they're not completely obvious. After testing the alarm, I feel like this will be a great deterrent if someone entered. Since it's in a confined location, the alarms are unbearable to withstand for long. The siren is audible a good 100 yards away with the door closed.The one problem I have with this system:Upon entry, the warning beeps on the console are very noticeable and can be traced. If there was an option to disable it, this would be a all around great system. I already have an idea to conceal the console not so much to hide it but make it a little more tamper proof. As long as the batteries remain in the console, it will still set off the alarms. It's my only issue but one of those things that contradicts the element of surprise. Thirty seconds in a garage is still enough time to grab something and get out of there before any neighbors make an effort to get up and see what the commotion is about.A remote would be nice so it can be disabled prior to entry. More of a luxury than a necessity in this case.If I was a homeowner, I would opt for a higher model security system but this is very suitable for an apartment and apartment garage.

Ross (previous post) hit the nail on the head! In doing so, saved me alot of typing (thanks!).I would like to add in a few notes:First off, I should give an explanation of my setup: I live in an apartment, so obviously have neighbors on the other side of my walls. I have 2 doors, and 2 windows that can be accessed without a ladder, so I purchased a \"starter control center,\" 3 additional door/window sensors (it came with one), a remote siren, and a motion sensor.1) I elected to add the \"Remote Siren\" on the first floor close to the controller. The controller itself emits 105db (or so) , so with an additional 105db....a tripped alarm is SUPER LOUD!! They both plug into the wall, and also have battery backup....so even if the electricity is out/cut off....the system will still trip. I have purchased another I am going to mount outside in an inconspicuous place, that is protected from the elements....but will still annoy/alert the neighbors and let them know whats going on.2) I purchased a motion sensor as well, and the thing works great. The only problem is....if you have a pet (dog, cat, bird, ect) that will be inside of its range, IT WILL TRIP. I took mine down and put it in a cabinet for use when I'm on a trip, and have my dog with me. Regardless of that, the good thing about the controller is that if you set it to \"home\" the motion sensor is disabled (so you can set the alarm at night, and wake up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water without sounding the alarm), but if you set it to away...it will trip just like a door/window was opened. That being said:3) The controller gives you two options (as mentioned by P.S. Ross and myself)..... \"Home\" and \"Away.\" \"Home\" sounds immediately, and \"Away\" starts a 45 sec countdown....so you can disable it when you get home. 45 seconds IS PLENTY OF TIME FOR THEM TO DISABLE/ STEAL WHAT THEY WANT. So get creative and figure out a way to set the system to \"Home\" even when you are away....and hide the controller in a good place....they will have to hunt it down...and if you have other remote sirens in the vicinity....it will make it a bit harder ;-)PROS: This alarm system is a very affordable/alternative to getting a \"professional\" system. Its highly effective, easy to use, and can be installed/moved without a big headache.

I have a 2500 sq house and alarmed all the windows and put an alert on the gate that enters the backyard.  Our main concern is safety for people in the house from intruders, (we are not worried much about valuables while we are not here), so we didnt want to hassel with alarms on the doors (that have to be turned on/off when we enter), and we wanted to be able to have our window open at night and still have the protection of the alarm.  What I decided to do was alarm the screens on my windows, and then just carefully lock and bar all the doors, and I found an easy way to install the GE sensors on my particular window frames to do this (I had to break the magnet cases though and install just the small magnet bar in the windows).  It took only about a half a day to install it all and have it working (I am a bit handy with testing electronics tho).  Ok having the screens alarmed is not exceptionally secure (when the window is open someone might be able to hold the sensor in place with one hand and punch through the screen with the other, then find a way to hold the sensor in place while climbing in without setting the alarm off, but they would see risk and likely be deterred without trying). However alarming the screens has the advantages that: 1) we leave the system always on and rarely is it ever left off accidentally, and 2) we can open and close windows as we like and feel that we would likely be warned of intruders even with open windows, and 3) when the windows are closed and locked (the usual) an intruder would have to remove the screen and set off the alarm before even starting to work on the window lock, which would give anyone inside ample early notice that they were under attack and so could call or run for help.  I feel this is much safer for protecting people than alarms on window that would only go off once the window was open ( and the intruder was only seconds from laying hands on you) and that would have to be turned off every time we wanted fresh air (with out forgetting to turn them on when the window is closed).  What I have found is that: 1) the most distant two sensors each needed a separate repeater which works ok but occupies a wall plug (and you need one repeater per sensor), 2) I have used the system for just over a year, and only one sensor just recently needed a battery replacement (the unit is hard to open to replace the battery), 3) once every couple of months something makes a light flash on the controller and I have to reset one of the sensors in the circuit that flashes (I don't know what causes this, but it is a rare and minor problem), 4) the primary alarm cannot be heard out on the street so I installed a second alarm in the garage and it can be heard on the street, but overall the alarms are not exceptionally loud, and 5) I have often tested sensors and they have always worked and in 1 year there has never been a false alarm.  Overall this is a GREAT product and I am VERY happy with it, and my whole family feels much more secure now.  The only improvement to suggest would be to add more advanced functions to the controller (like an auto phone dialer), but even as it is it has impressive functionality, especially given the price which is about 1/2 of what other similar systems cost, and a tiny fraction of what a service charges.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY Limited Range", "Author": "Brian M.

As soon as the door is open, the alert sounds and is loud enough that it will wake a heavy sleeper (me), but not so loud that it will wake up the entire house.The Bad:The range is fairly limited, which makes placement of the unit difficult.  It was purchased to alert my wife and I of when our children left their rooms, so that we did not end up with roaming children in the middle of the night.  If you have a larger square footage, you will have to move the unit as close to the sensor as possible.  If you plan to have the unit in a central place in your home, to act as an actual alarm system, then you will have no issues.Overall, and for the price, this is a very versatile product that can serve a variety of functions.

I do not have a built-in garage, so if you do this may work great for you.  The sensors are a bummer as well.
