And here is why. It's about the size of man's palm, not very stealthy, but it does look like regular motion detector. Battery operation could be a big plus, but lithium batteries only lasted half a day on motion sensing recording, it could last longer if that would be continuous recording, I think. So the fact that you have to keep it plugged-in in an outlet, and the cord is not very long really doesn't help. Also forget about low light recording, it's not existent. Lastly it could be just minor thing for somebody, but field of view it's only about 50 degrees.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not quite up to my like but it works...", "Author": "D.

Record into 12 sec clips (under high quality 640x480) even you set at 30sec clip per motion record.2. Low light recording are not great.3. Motion detection area is greater then camera angle.4. Won't last a day if on batteries, need to plug in.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not a functional camera, really...", "Author": "Juan Uribe", "ReviewID": "R3PLAP91IL81DV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How it is suposed You are going to review your nanny's activities without sound?...Woh can i know if nanny is using porperly language with my baby if camera HAS NOT SOUND?I think publicity MUST BE MORE SPECIFIC in order to AVOID customers about this feature limitation.Other things i do not like:- Mounting hardware is not good designed, it do not allow you to \"point\" to every directions, only a few inclination is possible.- front face looks like made of paper... bad quality.- low ilumination recording is really useless... you cannot see almos anything.- A big \"design\" trouble... if you install your cameras and do not let ugly cables outside the walls (i mean, it is necessary for stetic stuff hide cables)... so... after doing this intallation... how it is supossed i'm going to get the camera connected to my TV?... may me a third AC/DC conversos is needed.In few words: A very bad product...
