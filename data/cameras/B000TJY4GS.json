It is very easy to understand...if you have owned a Kodak camera before. All of the funtions are great for a person that doesn't want to spend over $200 dollars. The colors are great fun, if you like to be different. The anti-shake feature is great tooTakes great pictures and love the updated Kodak program that comes with it. Easily downloadable.The only thing that I didn't like was that the battery it comes with lasts about 2 days before it says it is low. Make sure you buy the adaptor with it so you can use it more than 3 days ;). The adaptor is very hard to find if you don't order it online. The stores refered me to search online for it, if that tells you anything.", "Date": "August 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Bat Ma", "ReviewID": "R2FSK8M51XUKHR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is fantastic, the screen is big enough to see your pictures clearly, buttons are well-placed and respond quickly.  However, the software that comes with it does not work well with Vista.  I have had to download a couple of updates and sometimes it just doesn't respond at all and I have to come back and deal with it later.  Seems to only happen when I am trying to email pics.  Most everything has trouble with Vista though so I wasn't surprised.  The camera is great though.", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!", "Author": "P.

I was thinking about buying a digital camera so I asked him why he picked this one.  Lots of features too numerous to mention here.  So I got one and love it's compact size and weight as much as the features. My teen daughter has since bought one and uses it all the time.  Also love that it takes videos.  And when my son lost his on a trip, he bought another one.  Can't say it better than that!", "Date": "March 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not Happy Blurry Pictures", "Author": "HrGlassLady \"Relaxing Sisters Book Club\"", "ReviewID": "R3SWC1XITUOIZ2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kodak M753 camera in NOV 07 and I love the cooper color.

After a decent amount of research I decided on the M753, great features and a resonable price. For the first 5 months the picture quality was great you could see the smallest details on every pictures. then just before my 2nd child was born my pictures started coming out blurry.... so now I have gone back to my old sony cybershot, even tho it is old, from 2001, it still takes clearer pictures than this camera.

The MOV mode is the APPLE (Quicktime) video. This means that when you download a movie on a Windows computer, you must have QUICKTIME loaded to play a movie you took in this camera on your PC. Not fun! Then the pictures are blurry! The worst thing is when I bought this camera, it does not take AA batteries like most do. It has a rechargeable battery which is expensive to replace. If you travel and the battery runs low, you have to go recharge it! Awful. I returned this and bought a Samsung 860 in Pink for $30 lower price.
