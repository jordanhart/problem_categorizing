I use it for work and it seems to want to keep shifting mode when in the auto setting, it is not as much a point ad shoot as the previous model which is all I need. I find I have to retake shots more often and fiddle with the camera settings. Wish I had just bought another L18.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this Nikon", "Author": "Armsmere", "ReviewID": "R13MJ9D3E0FRV4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this 8.0 MP camera because the 12 MP one I first tried caused grainy lines through each shot when displayed on my computer screen.  I read a review that camera makers were producing too many high MP cameras and the shot-quality was suffering.  So I tried this one because it was 8 not 12 or 16 or 18!  The pictures are perfectly clear and detailed and the camera is sturdy and easy to use.  It is a sharp looking camera and at Christmas my family members were all saying, \"Wow nice camera!\"  They are not used to seeing me with nice new technology!  The picture quality is great, the videos are clear, and the instruction book easy to follow.  I was thrilled not only with the camera but with its price!  Amazing what you can get for less than a hundred dollars!  I would recommended the L19 to everyone.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Depends on what you want", "Author": "Carla", "ReviewID": "R12F9L825J68NL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I normally research the purchase of a camera but needed this one in a hurry for it's macro capability and it was cheap enough for the purpose without researching and for the spontaneous buy (it was a deal of the day I think. Paid about $50 and it's on CNET for $128. But, I have to admit, that it's battery compartment is very difficult to use. You have to use the battery lid to push the batteries down and lock it, and it doesn't always make the right seal on the battery compartment when you do this.Also, if you don't have very new batteries, the camera won't always turn on. Battery life isn't that great either really. Sure, the camera has a lot of settings, but it seems that the auto focus doesn't always work and the inside settings don't work that well either. But, only if you're picky like I am and want good photos all the time. For a point and shoot if you're willing to have a 50/50 \"shot\" at a good pic, then it's worth the money.Video is not good in low lighting as my old camera, a canon.Fall 2012 Update: Just wanted to point out that now, the lens shutter doesn't always close, part of it stays open. I have found that if you take your finger and lightly brush it over it in the direction it needs to close, in a panning motion, that the lens cover will close manually (it make take a few tries to get the right glide/pressure motion.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad Item", "Author": "PrncssMunchkin", "ReviewID": "RXBI162F88SEU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Shipping was in decent time but the camera didn't work.
