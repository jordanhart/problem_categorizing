{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Olympus C-7070", "Author": "D. Childress", "ReviewID": "R3EGYFSPTJFU8R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was a new model just released when I purchased it.  I was after the C-5060 but to was able to get the 7.1 megapixel camera with the even sharper pictures for just a couple of bucks more.  Olympus makes quality cameras, though they tend to always be changing models, and this new model is definitely that.  There is a bit of a learning curve to properly use this camera, but once done it is quite simple to get high quality shots all the time, inside or outside, night or day, sunny or cloudy. The wide angle zoom is very nice, however to really get wide angle landscape or inside group photos you need to get the .45 wide angle lens attachment.  Also the 3.0 telephoto attachment, too while you're at it. It is not necessary to buy these attachments and adapter at Olympus.  Check J&R; Photo and 47th Street Photo on the web for high quality lenses at a fraction of the Olympus price. 1st rate quality and professional help, if needed.  Also, the 32 megabyte Xd picture card will hold only a very few shots with any kind of printable resolution so get at least a 512 megabyte card that will allow you some shots before you fill it up.  512 mb cards can be found with a bit of shopping for 1/3 the Olympus price. All in all this is a very quality mid-range camera that should be suitable for most enthusiasts and those who prefer easy to get quality photos.", "Date": "May 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "very good, but a couple of significant drawbacks", "Author": "Jujube \"Jujube\"", "ReviewID": "RAYG2L1ODM4B4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera early this summer and, in general, found it an excellent value for the $380.1. Good super macro capability at 1.5\", although not good enough for much outdoor photography. My older Sony DSC F828 got closer. I also read that the forthcoming Fuji Finepix F9000 has a minimum distance of .5\".2. The macro/super macro switching is a time consumer, especially when trying to photograph a moving insect.3. The options and the aperture/shutter priority options are very helpful.4. The battery life is excellent.5. Movie mode has better resolution and longer clips than many.The problems:1. The lens cap is extremely annoying, as it not only falls off easily, but it only fits when the camera is turned off and the lens retracted. Makes it more difficult when one wants to move around the woods without turning the thing on and off every half minute. Strongly advise buying the sky filter with the camera to protect the lens. This is the biggest reason that I wouldn't purchase another one.2.  Again, the super macro/macro switiching is a bit time consuming.3.  The optical viewfinder is almost useless, providing only about 70% of the picture.4. The advance shooting info is on CD. Can't pack it with you when shooting.5. Many options, but confusing menu screens can take a while to learn.Otherwise, it's a very good value.", "Date": "September 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Probably the best \"prosumer\" camera currently", "Author": "Kenneth Cobb", "ReviewID": "R1U05P2BPOXFXU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:-- Wonderful image quality, especially with RAW mode.  Photoshop Camera Raw plugin 3.1 will read it (yeah!).-- Wide range of image size and compression options.-- Very good wide angle lens, great for travel, landscapes.  The overall range from wide to portrait is ideal for \"street\" use.-- Excellent macro mode.-- Very low noise for this kind of camera, ISO 400 is actually usable!-- Solidly built.  While not attractive, it looks very purposeful and serious -- which it is.-- A nice complement of direct use buttons with command dial.  Keeps you out of the menus for most things.-- Supports both CF and xD cards.-- Long battery life - about 450 shots.-- Unique swivel on the color LCD, works great.Cons:-- Slow!  This is the main thing you give up vs a DSLR.  Raw shots take 7 seconds (!!!!) to save.  Image review is fairly slow and tedious.-- Autofocus does not work well in low light.  You end up doing lots of manual focus, which is not ideal on this kind of camera.-- Menus are a bit clunky, take a while to get used to.  I have to admit I like the Canon approach better.-- Panorama mode only works with xD cards.-- Lens cap pops off when you turn it on.  Kind of humorous, actually.Conclusion:In the level of \"prosumer\" cameras (right below entry DSLRs), this is probably the one to get if you're looking for an ideal travel or \"walking around\" camera (but not if you primarily need telephoto/image stabilization).  Excellent image quality with great detail.  About as feature-packed a camera as you'll find.If you want DSLR-level images but are not quite ready to make the jump (or can't afford to), or if you want a serious backup camera, this is the one.4 stars (-1 for slow speed)", "Date": "October 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent all around prosumer digicam", "Author": "Cadenza", "ReviewID": "R5Y9GBKF4XOE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for 3 years now and have taken it on many trips. I chose this over the Canon G6, which is also a very good camera. Both brands use the same SONY sensor but I prefer the way Oly render its images. The 27mm WA lens is also a big plus as I mainly shoot landscape. Other features that tipped the balance in Oly's favor: magnesium body, super macro, ergonomics, hi-res/hi-contrast LCD, longer battery life, pixel-mapping, 4 custom modes, live histogram, threaded lens barrel (for filters), lower noise at ISO 200+ and bargain pricing. The menu system isn't as straight forward as the G6's but simple once learned. Although IQ straight out of the camera is excellent and comparable to the competition, I'm spoiled by Zeiss glass (Contax G) that I find myself frequently editing with Adobe PS to make my pix sharper, more saturated and contrasty. I've heard many say this is normal practice if you want results to look like film.Other than that, I'm happy with other aspects like RAW, flash accuracy, hot-shoe for external flash, accessory lenses and especially the tank-like construction. Speaking of which, I recently went camping and in the dark I tripped over a 20\" tall metal fire-ring. I fell with the C7070 in my hand, slamming hard against the ground. It was in a Lowepro case but I expected it to be damaged in some way, cosmetically or functionally. Absolutely nothing of the kind!Nagging issues... slight shutter lag and hunting AF in low-light situations, which seem to be a problem for most digicams in this segment. The optical VF covers only 82% of the actual image so shots where precise framing is a must requires the use of the LCD. Panoramic function works only with Olympus xD Card. Playback is slow. RAW takes forever (also typical of cameras of this category). IS would be nice.Problems... on rare occasions the camera would turn-off by itself and restart for no reason while the camera is ON... like it's resetting. But all camera settings remain unchanged and no pix in the memory card is lost. Trying to figure out if it has something to do with the CF card I'm using.Conclusion... I'm hanging on to this camera till the full size DSLR bodies drop to around $500.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "good but slow", "Author": "Manuel Olivier Grosselet \"tierradeaves\"", "ReviewID": "R2PNJZNEULYWLD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi folks,I read about this camera that It's a very good camera, but it's fairly slow to record the picture?
