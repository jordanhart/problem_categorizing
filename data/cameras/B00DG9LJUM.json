The Zoom is amazing with the 30X optical lens and the resolution is very good at 20 mega-pixels.  This camera takes really good pics in low light situations too. It's a great camera for the price and perfect for traveling.One happy customer.JC", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "so happy with this camera", "Author": "Julie Mass\u00e9", "ReviewID": "R309EAUYJE0SU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in replacement of my old 5 years camera and I really enjoy the new technologies as the zoom and the image quality.

The camera takes great pictures on the automatic settings but you have to remember to pop the flash if needed.

I like the heft, which is not overbearing, and dimensions.  I never feel like it is about to squirt out of my grasp, a feeling most small, slickl digital cameras give me.  The only thing it cannot do in terms of transportability is fit in the pockets of my jeans.  It--and its supplied carrying case--fit in ALL other pants I wear.  For jeans, I must wear a belt and use the case's belt loop.The camera's pictures approach the quality of those from my DSLR.  (And I defer to the many positive technical reviews of this camera.)  I anticipate that there will be some diminution of quality with enlargements greater than 20X30.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "All is ok", "Author": "lila", "ReviewID": "REH4J3KU61FDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i received all in good way, only ups have a minimun inconvenient, but i am happy with the cam, thanks amazon and focus camera, i  am complaced for the purchased", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "\"forever\" PROCESSING....", "Author": "rreid", "ReviewID": "R2GD9UU2OE49F7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera took wonderful pictures. But the \"forever\" PROCESSING. ..  screen after the shots made the camera almost worthless. Even  100x zoom is worthless if a photographer misses 100 shots waiting for the camera to cycle. SONY knows better than placing this camera on the market!!!EXCELLENT service from the amazon seller. Fully understood my problem and refunded my purchase.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DG9LJUM"}}
