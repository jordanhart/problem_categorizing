{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great looking Camera but performance was so so.", "Author": "Frantasy", "ReviewID": "R1SJXRR5RJ2LJZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera (GW737G) to replace one of my three 420 TVL cameras. The reason i was in the market for a replacement was because i needed something which has a higher res. Minimally, something which makes it possible for me to read license plates within 30 ft (line of sight) of the camera. I figured that at 700 TVL, i could not go wrong.First the positives ...This camera looks/feels well made and definitely scores points on the \"looks\" scaled. A little larger than I am used to (5.5 inch diameter base) but still good looking. As with CCTV cams in its class, it came with the standard power and BNC connectors so hook up was quick and easy. Like the description says (at least when i bought this in Aug it did), the camera does not come with a power adaptor so be prepared to provide your own. I had a couple of 1-2 Amp PS from earlier purchases so no problem there.The GW737G camera is loaded with IR LEDs. The camera i was hoping to replace only had 24 LEDs so this was certainly a plus. Besides a quick test with lights turned off indoors, I never actually operated the camera in natural darkness. With 48 IR LEDs, it had much better low-lighting performance than other cameras i have seen. Unless you are a pro or have been used to very high end cameras, this camera is likely to meet your low lighting performance expectations.Now why did i rate the camera Average ?This camera is advertised as 700TVL. Like i mentioned, this is why i purchased it. First thing i did was simply swap out my 420 TVL cam and pop the new camera (GW737G) in its place. I raced to my DVR (yes it supports D1 and its hooked up to a high res computer monitor) to check out the big improvement. Didnt see one. Besides the fact that the image was a little brigher, I was not blown away. My wife was actually unable to tell the difference.Ok, i thought. Maybe my \"low resolution\" problem all this while has been somewhere in the 100ft RG59 cabling between my DVR and my camera. I wanted a reason to keep this camera so i decided to run another test. I picked up a brand new RG59 cable (this time 50 ft) from CompUSA, hooked it up to the my 720p TV and connected the new (under review) CCTV cam. I rigged up a setup outdoors (it was day time) with the cameara mounted in front of my car -so that i could see the license plate on my TV. For some reason, I could simply not get the camera to produce a clear/readable image of my license plate even at 15 feet. 10 feet, sure but much beyond that, the video resolution was simply not good enough to make my license tag readable -even when i zoomed in while reviewing D1 DVR (configured for high quality, high res recording) footage.So no deal for me. However, I cannot say that this camera is not for others. I certainly have never owned a 700TVL CCTC camera with which to compare my experience. Considering the fundamental reason for which I bought the camera however, it failed to meet my expectations and i returned it. Thank goodness for EZ returns on Amazon.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006G3EW68"}}
