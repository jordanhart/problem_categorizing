{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Which of the SDxxx Series is right for you?", "Author": "diljs", "ReviewID": "R297MOX4W2XEXH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that Canon makes exceptional digital cameras; the best in the market right now. This is because they have always used high quality components since they began manufacturing digital cameras. This one is no exception.Now that I've sold you on a Canon, which one should you choose?First off, let's see if you really need an SDxxx camera, or would be better suited with a cheaper non ultraportable camera.The SDxxx Series offers several key advantages over less portable models:-Beautiful, sleek design and metallic body will wow anyone who sees it.-Gorgeous 2 inch LCD screens-The excellent Dig!c 2 processor (other Canons only have dig!c 1)-Much better movie mode than previous Canons-Small light, easy pocketabilityOn the other hand, there are some significant drawbacks due to the components Canon had to use to get the camera so small:-Few manual controls.-Pictures are not as sharp as those of similar non ultraportable cameras.-The flash is very close to the lens (lots of redeye problems)-More purple fringing issues than other Canons-Proprietary batteries that are expensive to replace-The LCD is very fragile. Read the SD200 and SD300 reviews to see lots of unhappy people whose LCDs broke. Canon's warranty does NOT cover this either. My suggestion? Buy using a credit card that offers a warranty in addition to the manufacturer's. If your lcd breaks, many CC companies will replace the camera no questions asked!If you don't need the ultra portability and flashy looks of the SD cameras, a slightly larger camera with more features might be right for you. I would highly suggest Canon's A510 or A520 if you don't need an SD model.If you still want an SD model, which one should you choose? The SD200 with 3.2mp, the SD300 with 4mp, the SD400 with 5mp, or the SD500 at a whopping 7.1mp?Your first instinct may be that more megapixels is better. Today, however megapixel ratings are similar to Ghz ratings in the computer world: They used to mean a lot, but they don't mean as much anymore. More megapixels do NOT mean a better image. They mean a larger printable image. Unless you have to have huge prints, you simply do not more megapixels. In fact, the 3.2mp of the SD200 is enough for anyone who doesn't plan on printing pictures larger than a standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper.That having been said, there are some differences between each SDxxx model. In order to get the larger 7.1mp sensor in the SD500, Canon had to make the camera larger. Thus, it is around a quarter inch thicker and 30% heavier than the other 3 models. The larger size did enable Canon to pack more features into it, however:Features unique to the SD500:-1/4 inch thicker-30% heavier-50% longer flash range-14% more battery lifeThe SD400 and SD500 also share these benefits over the SD200/SD300:-New \"Night Display\" feature which brightens the LCD in low light-My Colors feature lets you highlight or swap colors right on the camera-USB 2.0 High Speed supportThe following are shared by all the SDxxx Cameras:Pros:-Beautiful, eye catching design-Great image quality, though not as good as non ultraportable models-New Dig!c 2 image processor-Excellent Movie Mode-3x optical zoom is adequate for most people-Excellent, intuitive manual controls-Huge 2.0 inch lcd that looks great under various lighting conditions-Uses widely available and cheap SD cardsCons (most of these are minor quirks):-Some purple fringing problems-Proprietary batteries are expensive to replace and inconvenient at times-Lots of issues with fragile LCDs-No RAW support-Few manual controlsIf you do choose this product, the first thing you should buy is a larger SD memory card. The camera comes with a 16mb card (32 in the SD500), which is pretty much useless.You should also immediately purchase a case and some screen protectors to protect the LCD.", "Date": "April 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Canon SD500 vs Sony DSCP200", "Author": "William M. Gibson", "ReviewID": "R2B6GXFLBGHBRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am probably one of the first people that can now say that they have owned the new Sony DSC P-200 and the new Canon SD-500. In another review, I noted why I was not pleased with the picture quality of the Sony (lots of blurry pictures and unnatural color). I went out and got the Canon today. WOW! Big difference! I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!! The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion. I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down. Sharper pictures. More detail. More natural color.The Canon is very small, definitely pocket sized, but still easy to hold firmly. It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot. I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking. Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered. This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point. A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.Perhaps I have a defective Sony camera, but I have seen some other reviews where people had problems with blurry pictures, and it seems to be a known problem with the camera. After playing around with the Canon, I don't even want to take the chance of returning the Sony and getting a replacement. Its getting returned right away.", "Date": "March 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Hindsight is always 20/20 - Made the right decision up front", "Author": "J. P. Koenig", "ReviewID": "RW3LWOQ3SMK3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I took the family on a Disney Cruise to the Carribean, I shopped for a digital camera.  I spent many nights reading reviews from various sites, compared prices vs features, size, megapix, accessory cost, memory card price,etc.  I narrowed it down to a Sony Cybershot vs the Canon.  I can say that I am not a pro photographer in any sense, but I enjoy snapping \"tourist\" photos and ones of the family so one day when I am senile I will remember.  THIS CAMERA TOOK FANTASTIC PHOTOS, FOOEY ON THE NAYSAYERS.  The only reason their pictures turned out blurry is because they cant hold their hands still!WHY I'M GLAD I DIDNT BUY THE SONY:Sony memory cards are a rip off (try pricing their high-speed ones versus regular SD high speed), their spare batts are a cha-ching, and their fragile LCD's are complained about a lot.  Even though the Canon camera itself costs more than the Sony camera did, the Sony accessories would have cost me more than a fully loaded Canon w/ accessories! I'm sure the photos would have been nice also, but the features on the Canon are better and I have a higher megapizel camera for an overall cheaper cost of ownership.CANON'S COOL FEATURES!1.  Besides taking gorgeous, rich, color photos, I spent a few minutes reading the manual.  If you set it to SCN scene mode, there are a ton of pre-programmed modes that compensate for every setting, beach, night, indoor, close-up plants, and even fireworks.  I played with the various modes and I easily figured out which was best for the picture about to take. The Disney cruise ship did fireworks from it and the pix are awesome.  Cant wait until the 4th of July!2.  Super fast 1 second, ready to shoot time from the pocket. Didnt miss a single action moment!3.  Photostich- allows you to take panaramic photos left, right, up and down, then the included software automatically pastes the pictures together!  It rocks!4.  Battery life was fantastic.  I wasted my money on the spare battery (which was a generic Digipower from Best Buy and it died after 20 shots!) I used the camera all day, took photos and motion video and used up the 1gb storage space and the battery never died that day.5.  I bought a 1GB high-speed SD card for it from Fry's and I took motion videos with this camera!  They play back in Windows media player and I emailed those out; people thought it was from a camcorder!  I owned a Panasonic D-Snap and promptly sold it after my trip to Australia last fall.  Wish I took the Canon there instead!  Make sure you buy the high speed SD cards not a super Sunday sale cheap 512 card for $59!  A 1gb high speed is about $80-$100.  Also, dont forget to do a low level format 1st!6.  Their included software is a little cumbersome to learn, but it works well once figured out.  Just wish it had more editing features in it instead of having to use an external software for advanced editing.7.  LCD can be seen at 50% level even in full sunlight & zoom was decent for a compact dig cam.CONS (IF ANY)I dont really have any true complaints, but to be fair here are some.  Why pack a 32mb SD card?  That's worthless, it holds like 7 pictures, Canon ditch it and lower the price instead!  Dont like the flappy door thing covering the USB jack, seems cheesy. Camera can get slippery, use the hand strap at all times, thats cheap insurance!Hope this review helps, I know I appreciate the other reviews people posted here, it helped me make the right decision for an investment that costs over $700 with all the accessories.", "Date": "May 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Absolutely love it", "Author": "L. Wimberley", "ReviewID": "REAWGE1Z4O3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going to state it right away, I am a die-hard Canon fan.  I have Canon digital and film slr's, flashes, lenses, bags, the whole deal.  But, I'm not so blinded by camera love that I can't spot crap when I see it.  I have owned three different Canon compact digital cameras, and this is heads above all, the best of them!I started out with the S400, a camera I had for two years and LOVED.  Took about 9000+ images on it.  It started to act funny, and I knew it was time for an upgrade so I got the Canon Powershot A95.  I never really took to the camera, it was slowwwww to focus, and even though it was step up in megapixel power, the grain was HORRIBLE.  The S400 outperformed it in image quality.  I especially didn't like the A95 after I took it on a trip with me to Vegas, so two months later I sold it.I saw the SD500 at a store and on a whim, (since it looked so similar to my dear beloved S400) picked it up to play with it.  I accidently had grabbed the shutter when I went to pick it up and BOOM, in the span of a millisecond, it had focused and fired off a shot.  Right there, I knew I had my new camera.Starting off, the camera is a thing of beauty for the eyes.  Smaller in length then my 20GB iPod, (slightly thicker), the camera is a breeze to carry with you at all times.  THAT BEING SAID, I've read what other reviewers have written about the camera's durability and rated it badly because the lcd cracked.  Just because the camera is 'pocket sized', doesn't mean in any way that you should stick it in your pants pocket.  And then sit down with it in there, no less.  Anything is bound to break if you do that!  Get a sturdy case.  It needs to be protected.The camera is so much wuicker to focus then the previous powershot elph models.  That strange, slow clicking sound is gone, it focuses in under half a second and fires.  The flash recycle time is much quicker as well.  No morewaiting (provided you have a properly charged battery in the camera)Regarding battery life, it's pretty average for a rechargeable lithium battery.  Alot of people do not like propriety batteries, I don't mind them, I have three for the camera in case I'm on a long trip.  There's no reason not to have an extra, you don't want to be caught in the perfect moment to capture a photo and realize you have a dead battery with no alternative.This camera does not have full manual controls, like the A95 does.  You cannot adjust the aperture or the shutter speed.  This doesn't bother me, as I own a digital slr with full manual controls, but if you do not own an slr and are looking for a compact with manual contorls, this would NOT be the camera for you.  Check out the Canon Powertshot A series.The image viewfinder is large enough, at 2 inches.  I find myself sometimes getting finger prints on it easily when I go tograb the camera, but those are easily removed.  The brightness of the lcd is also user adjustable, which is something you take for granted.  I was going crazy when I had the A95 because I couldn't make the screen darker.  It was so bright, everything looked blown out and the images looked COMPLETELY different exposure wise once you got them on the computer.This powershot elph camera introduces a few new features that are incredibly neat and worth mentioning.My colors has several user editable functions, like color swap, (two colors that you define that can be exchanged to make a really cool effect) and one of my personal favorites, color accent which lets you define one color, say, a pink shirt a friend is wearing (you point the camera and the color and hit the arrow button and it copies the color data) and it turns everything else in the picture black and white except for that one color so that it stands out.  You can acheive this effect in photoshop, but being able to do it this easily in a camer is VERY cool.I also like the option of shooting with positive film color effects.  Blues are bluer, greens are greens, and reds are, well, you get the idea.  It's different from the vivid mode because it just doesn't blast everything out, it makes the colors pop, but keeps them rich and true looking at the same time.  The only gripe I have with this and the color accent features is that you cannot change the iso setting when you are in this mode, which to me, is a gross oversight.  These functions are only accessible in the manual section of the camera, you should be able to change the ISO!  I mean, you can change the white balance, why not let us be able to change the iso?!  The camera would be perfect if you were able to do that...Digital Macro is another really cool feature.  You can take macros photos, but much further.  It utilizes the digital, not optical zoom on the camera to bring the object closer while still keeping it clear.  It works amazingly well, but at 4x, grain starts to become very apparent.The stitch assist (panoramic) mode is still here, but this time you have to click through the menu to find it instead of having it readily avialible on the selection knob.  I noticed that you cannot shoot a panoramic sequence in macro mode, which dissapointed me bcause I wanted to try some flower panos.  Again, this is an oversight that really would've made the camera sing even more had it been included.The movie mode!  Oh my gosh, the movie mode.  Best move mode on a canon compact, I believe.  Double the FPS.  The little movies look great.  And unlink the A95, which would cut out after 30 seconds no matter how much room you had on your card, this'll let you keep going.All in all, this is the best compact digital I've owned so far.  I didn't think I'd ever be able to find a compact that I've loved like my S400, but I have.  And it's better.To sum it up:Pros:Near instant start-up (under .5 seconds)lightning fast focuslightning fast flashImproved color modesAmazing macro funtionsleek designimage quality A-MAZING!lcd screen brightness user adjustiblebest movie mode on a compact!Cons:No iso control in my colors modeno macro in pano modeIn the end, buy a sturdy case, and for goodness sake, have some sense and don't stick it in your pocket and sit on it!  You will be happy with this camera if you can follow those rules.  If you want a high qaulity compact digital camera with limited manual controls, this is it for you!", "Date": "August 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Canon SD500 vs.  Canon SD550", "Author": "Chris collins", "ReviewID": "R684G349LQVB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon SD500 and Canon SD550 are both very capable digital cameras. While they are similar in many respects, the list price is not one.  With the SD500's list price at $499.99 and the SD550's at $549.99, you might wonder what you are getting on the SD550 for that extra fifty dollars.  Hopefully this comparison will help you find out. The Similarities begin with the image processor.  Both cameras utilize the DIGIC II image processor.  According to the manufacturer this allows for \"superb image quality through improved colour gradation and white balance accuracy\". Since both cameras have this processor it affords an advantage to neither when deciding which camera to buy. The similarities continue with the amount of mega pixels.  The SD500 and SD550 each have 7.1 mega pixels.  This means that pictures taken with these cameras will still be detailed when enlarged. There are only really two differences between the SD500 and the SD550.  The first difference is the size of the LCD screen.  The SD500 has a two inch display.  It may not be the biggest on the market, but it works well.  On the other hand the SD550 has a two and a half inch display.  The extra half inch on the SD550 does make it a little easier to make out details than on the SD500. The second difference is the number of shooting modes.  The SD500 has 13 shooting modes, which in my opinion is more than enough if someone was just looking to buy a camera to take on vacations or to family outings.  The SD550 on the other hand has 16 shooting modes.  Those extra shooting modes may come in handy for the more serious photographer. I think it is safe to say that both the SD500 and the SD550 are good cameras.  If you have the extra fifty dollars to spend I would suggest the SD550 with its half inch more screen and 3 extra shooting modes.", "Date": "November 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Mindless, professional results", "Author": "C. Emch", "ReviewID": "RVEFI005XHLWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a user of a Canon G3 for 3 years now, but I wanted a high quality/ very compact point and shoot camera for travel.  The key here was buying something I or my wife could put into a pocket to carry and not have the quality of the results suffer due to size.Being a reseach psycho before buying anything, I narrowed the field down to 3:  Sony DCXT7, Casio Exilim z750, and the Canon SD500.  Then I went to the store to try them out (I can not stress this enough...it is worth the trip to a store to play with these), and the number of cameras being considered went to two.  The Sony, the sexiest camera of the group, was so thin it was nearly impossible for me to get a firm hold on (camera shake and red eye are the main problems with small cameras, all three of which have these issues to an extent, but Sony's camera was overly hard to hold, making it by far the worst for camera shake ), so I removed it from consideration...really too compact...plus it was 5 mp vs. 7 on the other two...for the same price.  That left the Exilim and Canon.One note on megapixels...more is better if you like to digitally play with photos on photoshop elements or another program (crop pieces out, etc) or want a 13 X 19 blow up ability should you capture the perfect picture. If neither apply's to you, the SD400 (same feature set, lens, processor) or another 5 mp would work just as well for less money...and give you the highest quality results needed up to 8X10 and a little bigger.  Me, I like to play with photos after the shoot, which is why I wanted the extra resolution.Just picking up and shooting with the SD500 produced great results (easy and mindless), and it was small, but not too small, to work with.  My wife does not care about F stops or shutter priority (which it does not have).  She wants to pick a subject, snap, and have amazing, mindless 7 mp results that rival the leading current prosumer G6 from Canon.  I suspect that a large number of people buying digital camreas want the same thing.If this is what you want, along with a great movie mode, useful scene modes, longer flash range than any camera this size, and a few fun fuctions (though you can do it on Photoshop, I enjoy the \"color swap\" (easily swap colors in a picture), & \"color accent\" (neat with B&W; photo, think \"Sin City\" for a camera)) this is the camera you want.  Mindless, stunning, professional results.  You really can't go wrong picking this camera.If you want or need full manual controls on a camrea this size, check out the Casio Exilim Z750, which came in a close second.And speaking of manual, thank you Canon, for including a compact printed manual for the SD500.

I replaced that with another S50 after I left it in a restaurant. It was great too had it for almost a year and it was stolen from my bag at a beach. I bought the SD500 and after TWO weeks of normal use (Never dropped) the LCD is broken. I wish I had read all the reviews of the LCD issues. Do not buy this or any other Canon elph type camera until they fix this obvious Camera FLAW. I suggest that everyone whom this flaw has affected should write Canon and ask them to correct this Flaw or cover it under  the warranty.  For this to be happening to this many people is ridiculous to say the least! Very dissapointed and will probably never buy another canon ever.

After what seemed like weeks of painful research, I went with the SD500, and have been delighted.Coming from Canon's Powershot A-series, I was a bit skeptical about the SD's being able to produce decent quality. After uploading a weekend of shots in Northern Michigan to my Mac (which was flawless without ever touching the included disc), I was floored by the quality of the shots -- and I'm not even a good photographer.As a simple point-and-shoot camera, the SD500 is great. But when you get in to the color enhancement / replacement features, it really shines. I took a few comparison shots of the lakeshore; some with the blue enhanced, and some normal. They all came out great, but the enhanced ones really popped. The most impressive thing was that you couldn't see any obvious signs of enhancement -- the colors were still balanced properly, and the beach / grass / cars all had true color.If you're looking for something pocketable with legendary Canon quality, look no further.", "Date": "August 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "This camera rocks!", "Author": "G. M. S. \"travel buff\"", "ReviewID": "R2WTOC5BX4S7O8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because my old camera (a Sony) fell victim to discontinued Sony technology.  Sony stopped selling the Memory Sticks that my camera supported (and a lot of other Sony products supported), and they chose to make their new memory sticks such that they were not compatible with the old ones.  Essentially, they purposely outdated their older merchandise, so that you could not longer buy accessories for them and would have to buy new ones.  So I got upset with Sony and turned to Canon for my new digital camera, and I couldn't be happier.  I was going on a one month trip, and knew I would need more memory than I had to get me through b/c I wouldn't have computer access, so I bought this little gem. It's a great camera and is very well made - strong construction.  And I can also say that Canon has excellent customer service - the camera stopped working during my trip (probably due to a spill I took hiking, when I had my camera in my hand), and Canon fixed the camera under the warranty, no questions asked.  The camera is very user friendly - it has tons of advanced features if you want them, but if you're not that technologically advanced or are feeling lazy and don't want to take the time to adjust the settings, the point and click settings still make it really easy to take great pictures.  Oh, and I love that you can charge the batteries without having to plug in the camera itself - if you buy an extra battery, you can leave one charging at home or in your hotel, while you are out using your camera, unlike my old Sony camera that you had to plug in to charge its battery.  The canon external battery charger is great!  I've been converted to Canon for life!Oh, and I also bought the underwater camera case because I knew I was going to be going on a kayak trip and swimming with dolphins, and that thing works wonderfully!  It's constructed so that you can still access every feature of the camera while it's in the underwater housing.  I took some great films of the dolphins under water.  I didn't take it to great depths because I was snorkling, not scuba diving, but for my purposes it was great!  If you're into scuba diving, I would imagine you'd want to buy the weight for the underwater case too, but for my purposes, that wasn't necessary - without the diving gear on, the fact that the case floats without the weight is a good thing!", "Date": "April 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Everything it seems, everything it should be, and more", "Author": "D.

I am not a photography professional, however I am a software engineer in the digital media field, an amateur photographer and... well a gadget freak. I have owned a digital camera since they first came out. Everything from a 1 megapixel plain-vanilla to a DSLR. I still have my \"prosumer\" Fuji, which is not a full blown professional SLR but it has a lot of manual features and costs something that would let you sleep at night. With the demise of film, taking hundreds of photos a day is no longer an unlikely event even for those who don't get paid by the hour to do so. My normal camera is just too big to haul around so I've been trying out everything under the sun to get THE best compact camera that I could always have with me, that would satisfy my gadget desire, work FAST, and never make me look at the resulting photos and say \"I wish I had my DSLR for that shot...\". I thought it was an unrealistic task but I was wrong. Before this cam, I tried many cams and one notable example is the Sony T7. It is the epitome of form over function. It's the size of a few credit cards stacked and it is about as useful. I won't go into too much detail other than mention one funny fact, that 60% of your photos will have your left middle finger in the top left corner due to the location of the lens (and the natural way any human being would hold a camera). So enter the SD500. You can't take a blurry photo with this camera... you just can't. A Ferrari was flying up to me on the highway this morning, I whipped out the camera, it sprung to life in under a second, I snapped the photo with the car flying past and my car moving around on the bumps, and the picture is clear as day. I have N E V E R had a camera that could do this. It doesn't make me miss the manual features of the SLR or even my \"pro-sumer\", the automatic systems are so intelligent and fast that it just doesn't leave you wanting. Oh and it's a 7.1 mpx, so zoom in optically, then crop it later in Photoshop, and you can have a clear 4x6 of an ant's bum if you want... So yeah I like it. :) One pet peeve though... WHY DO THEY INCLUDE A 32 MEG CARD WITH A CAMERA THAT TAKES 3.6 MB IMAGES??? Why not just include NOTHING and reduce the sticker price. A 1 gig card for this cam is a minimum. The 2 gig is perfect. Also, the battery is great, lasts much longer than all the compacts out there except Casio (those cams btw, I also tried, but they are basically a poor execution of a great idea [the idea that Canon has executed perfectly here]... wonderful on paper, but gimpy in reality) but get a backup cause digi cam batteries die when you need them most and you can't stop at a 7/11 to get some alkalines that will work, there's an Energizer that'll fit.

This is great for trips to the beach, snorkeling, and (not so deep water)diving.Bad:* Because it is so small and heavy with its metallic body, it's easy to drop and have bad impact on the camera body.  I dropped mine to the ceramic tile floor.  The point of impact was the corner of the battery compartment.  I force-open the battery cover (kissed my warranty good bye) with a thin piece of metal because I didn't want to send it to the service center - I was afraid to lose my pictures in the card!* Camera shake due to its small body.  Canon should have done better to fix this.* Pricey* SD card comes with the camera is TOO low on capacity* No direct in camera link to power chord.

I use this whenever I don't want to carry around my big beautiful 20d, which is most of the time, and now I can still capture most of what I want with a crisp 7 megapixels. I had a real problem with the other elphs, and similar small cameras slowness but this thing is amazingly fast. The other big improvements include the smooth movie modes, they look great and if you have a fast and big sd card you can record a pretty long movie (apprx. 8min on 1gb).

We loved that camera so my husband was thrilled to get this one...I was eager to get my butterfingers on it too. I own the Pentax ist*DS as well and that is a fabulous camera for anyone wanting to go the SLR route.Anyhow, this camera fell far short of our expectations. It does seem to have a slightly less hard time with redeye (one star) and the outdoor pictures are still sharp and crisp (2 stars) and the camera itself starts up quickly so you don't miss as many of the shots of the kids (3 stars). However, even when using Indoor mode on the portrait setting...the noise in the pictures is unreal! I have had to buy photo editing software in order to keep any indoor pictures of my kids. We never had this problem with the 4 MP and I can not figure that out. I've tried with flash, without...our windows and doors are always wide open due to the heat...we have an extremely well lit home, and the interior colours are all whites and light blue...there is nothing dark about our house. Yet I can not get a clear picture of my children even if they are passed out cold. I've played with the ISO settings on other modes as well. That was my biggest beef with this camera I take pictures with the Pentax, no flash, indoors in our home all the time and they turn out brilliantly. If anyone can give me some pointers on what I may be doing wrong or some setting I might be able to change I'd be glad to try it out and revise my review.Secondly, this huge LCD display.  Perhaps I'm paranoid about dropping another camera but I find I don't have a good feeling about holding the camera. I have tiny hands...and I have a hard time figuring out where to put my fingers so that I don't smudge or damage the LCD or put my finger in front of the flash...very poor design on the part of Canon. I'd gladly give up the slightly larger LCD for some practicality, stability and durability. Three of my friends bought the same camera as well...all three of them have had the LCD get wrecked in the span of a month. It's just too large and unprotected. One friend scratched hers, another friend has a dent in hers and it no longer works at all, and the third friend has a problem with hers not displaying even though the rest of the camera works. I'm extremely careful when using the camera for fear of wrecking the fragile LCD...again I never felt this way with the SD400 which was built very very very well! come on Canon you can do better than this! I swear the cameras number of megapixels go up but the level of durability and quality goes down.Don't even get me started on the lousy video quality...the  sound is horrible! and the battery needs charged very frequently!And when are Canon going to come out with a camera that can be taken to the beach, the pool underwater...like the optio...or the new olympus. Or offer some kind of warranty on their cameras when used with their underwater cases. Why make a product if you can't stand behind it. The first camera company to come up with a camera that actually fits an active family lifestyle, with the service, quality and warranty to back it up...they are going to be number 1Unless we can figure out the noise problem we are going to sell this camera second hand and go for the new waterproof Olympus ...better money spent.", "Date": "July 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Canon SD 500 delivers everything you want in a small package", "Author": "JoshEEE \"josheee\"", "ReviewID": "R2YGGF4UKWQJW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up this 7MP digital Elph to replace my Powershot S50.

I use a Sandisk Ultra II 1GB memory card with it, and the shot to shot time is less than 5 seconds to aim, focus, shoot and review each image. You can shoot faster if you want, or shoot continuous images, but the basic speed is more than enough for me. Power on is also almost instantaneous.Image quality is very nice, but because the flash is so close to the lens, you'll find anyone you photograph who has light eyes may end up with redeye, more so even than other camerasI've used.Battery life is excellent (I'm getting over 100 shots right now, but this camera is only a few weeks old so I'm sure that will deteriorate).You can take movies on this camera, but I found that I had a hard time loading movies over 3 minutes long with the standard Windows \"Scanner and Camera Wizard\".

The SD500 7MP is a superbly engineered camera with wonderful ergonomics.  It takes excellent pictures that are startlingly good taking into account the size of the instrument.  Pictures taken without flash are generally very well exposed, requiring no touch-ups in photoshop.  The built-in flash is OK; in some light you may get a bluish tint, which can be adjusted either by fiddling with the various exposure settings on the camera, or by post-processing in a program like photoshop.Some reviewers have commented that the back LCD is delicate.  I'll take their word for it: most users will want the Canon leather case which offers some protection.  My favored configuration is the SD500, the Canon leather case, and the long Canon metal strap, allowing the user to have the camera around one's neck in casual settings.  For more formal occasions i.e. dinner parties, etc. the SD500 slips nicely into a suit pocket.This camera is a joy to use.  The menus are very intuitive.  I had them nailed after about 20 minutes, without any reference to the manual.  Most of that time was figuring out one simple thing: that on auto setting most settings choices (flash settings, for example) are not available, whereas on \"manual\" (which is really semi-auto) these settings are available.  Most users will likely want to shoot using \"manual.\"With a camera this size, red-eye is an issue.  The red-eye flash setting works, with the usual drawback of shutter lag.  I try not to use it and post-process the red-eye instead.Overall, this one is a home-run.  Users who don't need a camera quite this small may want to consider the Canon S50-60 series.

The pictures are even better than the S400 - sharper & crisper. The 2\" screen is another great feature that helps as in the past it was hard to tell if the picture was effected due to camera shake or not.

Although the SCN feature has yet to impress me, the pictures I took under different light conditions were all great.

What a great camera this has turned out to be.  It takes beautiful pictures, the flash distance is strong, which is good, but it does also result in more redeye than cameras with weaker flashes (no way of getting around this), so I also do some post-camera adjusting on my computer occasionally to remove the red-eye.My Canon starts up quickly, has very little lag in between pictures, and is a gem all the way around.  The one feature I am more impressed with than I thought I would be is the video clips.  These clips aren't just little, junky clips that you can only email around, I have used the camera in lieu of a camcorder several times when taking pictures of my 5 month old, and it is great.  Much easier than downloading the video from the camcorder, editing it, turning it into an mpeg, etc.  Now, clearly it won't substitute for a camcorder all the time, since you can fit nearly as much on a 512MB SD card (I bought a 512MB and would recommend this size to others, and if you plan to do video and/or use the high-speed camera mode, you should buy the faster speed cards....e.g. Sandisk Ultra II, or ATP Hi-Speed 60x, it reads and writes from and to the card very quickly, important when doing video as well as taking pictures quickly and downloading them to your PC).I chose a Canon due to partially to the stylish look of it, but really most of the reason was due to recent experiences my wife and her in-laws have had with other Canon models.  They have been using Canon cameras over the past couple of years, 1 was the S400 and one was an SLR-type 7MP camera, and they really take beautiful pictures, seem to focus really well on the subject, and the resolution just seems to be superior.  I had a Sony 3MP before, and my wife was given a Canon S400 3MP, and the Canon kicked the crap out of my Sony.  In the end, you will pay a bit more for the Canon but if you have the means, I highly recommend it.

My two major candidates were the SD500 and the S70.If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the SD500 vs the S70. The S70 offers excellent manual controls while the SD500 is significantly smaller with very limited manual controls other than exposure compensation.I just LOVE the look and feel of the SD500 though if anything it could be argued that it is TOO small. If you feel it is and you are looking for a carry everywhere camera it is well worth the effort to get used to the small size because the camera takes wonderful pictures.The SD500 is simply beautiful. I didn't think I'd like the \"curve\" from the pictures, but it does not detract, and in fact actually contributes to the elegance of this form factor. I can live without all the manual controls since I own the 20D and since this camera is primarily for my wife and for me when I don't want to lug the SLR around.The sensor size of the SD500 is the same as that of the S70 (in fact it is the same Sony 7.1 MP sensor) - 1/1.8\". This is an ideal size for a point and shoot IMO. The 1/2.5\" sensor used in the smaller Canon series cameras represents a poor image quality trade off. Stick with the larger sensor which give less noise, chromatic aberration, and better image quality.I purchased the leather Elph case which protects the camera well and only adds insubstantially to the bulk. Some have complained that prior iterations of this camera scratch easily. I've owned them and found that if you keep the camera in a case and exercise modest caution that the camera will remain pristine.Several have pointed out that since this camera is so small it will always be with you whereas the S70 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size. I couldn't agree more! The camera is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller than its bigger brother the S70 and in fact is discernibly smaller than my previous S400 which I gave to my daughter. The form and size factors are what finally won me over.The additional 3 MP over my previous S400 was an additional factor in deciding to switch. That extra 3MP gives me plenty of extra MPs for cropping with impunity. This camera is a significant improvement over the previous S400 in image quality, resolution, mega pixels, color rendition, color saturation, and purple fringing.The good news about the extra 3MPs is that they are added WITHOUT adding extra noise. I don't know exactly how Canon accomplished this but this is somewhat akin to getting something for nothing! No significant trade-off was involved. The DIGIC II processor is fantastic in producing great photographs.One criticism of the camera. Low light focusing is less than ideal.

We were in the market for an ultracompact camera with awesome picture quality -- this is certainly top of the line at a reasonable price!Even though it's 7 megapixels I have no complaints about speed whatsoever. It powers up and takes picture at a pretty good speed. I like taking pictures on the absolute highest quality setting... we also purchased a large memory card (1GB) which holds about 331 pictures on the highest possible setting. Beautiful.I haven't messed with any of the manual functions yet. For me, this camera is perfectly advanced to be the ultimate point-and-shoot camera. Yet a glance at the features reveals a lot of very impressive available control.  This camera is as simple as you want it to be (if you're looking for a point-and-shoot), or as complicated as you want it to be (if you like manual controls).As far as size goes, it's very good. I've had it in the pocket of my cargo shorts several times during outdoor functions.

This one fits the bill perfectly!  While not as slim and tiny as others in the market these days, it takes beautiful pictures and is a snap to download pictures onto my computer.  Of course, you've gotta love instant gratification and the truth is, the pictures are often even better than how they appear on the viewfinder.  It has a great feel, the controls are very straightforward and easy to use.  The LCD is big enough that I can continue to deny my need for bifocals in seeing small print.  There are bigger LCD's out there, but I also believe this is the most breakable part of a digital camera, not covered by warranty.  So bigger isn't always necessarily better.On the downside, admittedly, the red-eye feature doesn't necessarily work in that I still get the redeye thing (obstensibly because the flash is so close to the lense -- a common problem in compact digitals), but that's the easiest thing to correct with today's computer software.  Plus, there are cameras on the market that now take regular batteries vs. risking the possibility of the chargable battery dying at the worst possible moment.  But my daughter's camera (using AA's) seems to drain batteries at a really rapid clip.  Also, there is no internal memory card (unlike the 550) and the card that comes with the camera is really small.  I recommend buying a larger card immediately, especially if you want to use the video function.While I am somewhat behind the general population in that this is my first digital camera, if you're looking for a fun camera that has plenty enough of bells and whistles to be creative AND yet takes great point and shoot pictures, this is a good choice.", "Date": "January 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera but VERY, VERY fragile LCD", "Author": "B.

I've taken a hundred or so pictures on one battery charge.  More than my old camera would take on NiMH AAs.But it has a few problems:1) Yes it has a viewfinder.  That's why I bought it.  However, the VF is tiny and has no magnification or adjustment so people who need reading glasses like me can't us it.  A waste of hardware.2) So yes, I use the LCD (which is hard because of reading glasses).  It is reasonably bright and reasonably big and reasonably fine-grained, but it is not as nice as the really new pocket-cams.  I did not get those because of the lack of VF.  If I had known, I would have gotten a newer camera with a bigger and brighter screen.3) The mode control is kind of tricky to operate.  You need to catch the tab with your fingernail in order to turn it.  It takes a bit too much force so it is very easy to overshoot and get the wrong mode.  I bet it will be a bear in the cold.4) I was really shocked at the cruddyness of the cap over the USB port.  It's kind of a plastic thing that you have to jangle around and then bend back on its little plastic leash.  That puppy's going to break soon.So my summary is that this is a camera that takes good pictures (though I'm not expert).  The USB2 port downloads them quickly too.  It has some issues that may or may not bother you, or you may decide are worth putting up with for the low price.  If you want the low price, go for it.  You won't be getting an awful camera.

Out of 50-60 pics I took, around 30-40% pics came out blurred to some extent, little or large. I realized that pics taken inside the room, pics taken outside in the evenings and pics taken with zoom and pics of moving objects came out to be blurred to some extent.Wise Again----------The entire blurry thing got me suspicious and I just did search in google for 'sd400 blurry', 'sd500 blurry', 'sony dscp200 blurry' and I could read several posts where people found pics to be blurry with all the compact sized cameras. Some of the reviews did point out image stabilization is not so profoundly present in smaller cameras because of component sizes.After some deliberation I just decided to do away with 'compact camera thing', after all why spend $400 to have a camera that may blur that very special moment.

The E18 is when the lens locks in the open position for any number of reasons; misuse, sand or dirt, touching the lens while moving and, from what I can tell, no reason at all.  I returned the camera for a replacement.  The second camera worked for 6 months then, to my surprise...E18 error.  I called Canon, sent it back and within a few weeks they repaired it under warranty.  Flash forward about a year...E18 error.  However, now I have no warranty and Canon wants to charge me $195 to fix what can only be a product defect, not my fault, as I take care of this camera very well.So instead of sending it in for the price of buying a new camera, I google \"E18 error\" to see if it is fixable on my own.  Surprise!  There are entire web pages dedicated to the E18.  Wikipedia has a page for the E18 error.  There have been thousands of accounts and emails posted from inept and rude Canon service reps and managment (although most people I dealt with were kind, but unhelpful).After unsuccessfully convincing Canon the onus is on their poor product quality and they should at least fix the camera for me, I gave up my quest and bought a new camera...a Sony, so far so good.Bottom line:  Canon will not stand behind its product.  This defect, while not experienced by all, has been experienced by tens of thousands (this fact is from Canon itself).  After the warranty is out, they will not help you.  They will sell you a refurbished camera for $175....no thanks.I didn't buy a \"disposable\" camera, however, that is what Canon is selling.

Firstly, the viewfinder, completely removed from all newer compact cameras, is a lifesaver, especially if the LCD screen is cracked. The viewfinder shows the zoom. The zoom feature is smooth & manageable. My new Canon PowerShot A4000IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens with 720p HD Video Recording and 3.0-Inch LCD (Red) zoom is speedy, & somewhat difficult to control. Sure the LCD is smaller than the newer model PowerShot cameras, but I think this enhances the battery life. I also believe the smaller display screen on older model cameras extend the battery life.When I took my Canon SD500 to Europe for two weeks, I never had to recharge the battery. Photos were more than satisfactory, they were great quality photos.The Canon SD500 is more compact & sturdy than my newer PowerShot A4000. The SD500 feels like quality, including the battery & charger. The newer PowerShot A4000 feels light, cheap, and the battery charger and battery compartment feel fragile. I am fairly unimpressed with the quality of the the PowerShot A4000, despite the higher resolution, higher zoom, and HD video recording. The photo quality difference is insignificant.The photography options offered between the two models are similar (i.e. face detection, fireworks, etc.). I like the button placement on the SD500, as well as the physical button options. The buttons are easy to use, not to small, and intuitive for navigation.Overall, the SD500 is an excellent camera, even compared to newer models with higher resolution & zoom. It takes great pictures, has excellent battery life, is compact, solidly built (including accessories), and has the wonderful option of an actual viewfinder.I highly recommend this camera if searching for a sturdy, quality camera with a viewfinder with great battery life & excellent photo quality!", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Review After 3 Years!", "Author": "Ms_Ladi \"...just wandering the world.\"", "ReviewID": "R1AD6370448VCN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in late June 2005 in hopes of having it to replace my Canon SD30 (3MP, first digital camera) on a trip to Switzerland.  Well, the camera didn't arrive in time, but I wish it did.  The camera was the best I'd ever used and I was awed by all the new features.  I irritated everyone at work constantly taking photos using the color swap and color accents.  This is the greatest feature I've seen and my only regret is going through my pictures over the years and not using those features enough.I immediately put a screen protector on the LCD, so I didn't have any problems there.  Unfortunately during a day of puppy kindergarten, I forgot about the keys and change in my pocket and slipped my brand new camera in with them.  After the initial shock, I saw the tiny scratches as \"war scars\" and soon disregarded it.Start-up time was amazing.  I was always ready to shoot upon pressing the power button.  I was even able to put my own personal picture on the startup screen so I wouldn't have to look at the generic \"birdy\" or \"Powershot\" name.  I am sure I could have put my own startup music on there also, but I never took the time to try it.  I did it for my Canon SD30, though, so I'm sure it was possible.My other regrets in picture taking was not taking the highest setting possible.  I don't render my pictures immediately, so sometimes months later when I'm editing Christmas pics, I'll see a nice photo that could have been blown up and sent to my family.The best thing I loved about this camera was its battery life.  I can probably count on my hands the number of times I had to recharge the battery.  I NEVER lost battery life during a trip or photo event, although most of my trips were 2-4 day weekends.  Still, this camera handled any type of pressure I threw its way.  I hope my upgrade to the Canon SD950 does all of the SD500's capabilities and more.So why am I upgrading?  Well, I love photography, even though I rarely have the time to really do it as a bonified hobby.  I also love gadgets and upgrade electronics.

I found this camera can perform beyond my need. It has so many functions that I doubt I will use them all. But ONE thing I love the most is the \"Photo-Stitch\" option that allow you to take a panormaic scene. When I loaded the series of pics on my computer, the software easily (and within a nano second) stitch up the pictures into one perfect, flawless panoramic scene. It will be good for travel and special event.A few complaints I have are: it is complicated to get to certain functin because Auto-mode allow you to do certain thing while manual and scenic mode allow you to do abit more. It is difficult to remember all that while you need to shoot in a hurry. Also, in the video-mode, there is some hiss-noise which quite bothering.Other than that, I give a 4 stars rating for this little devil!", "Date": "September 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "M.

It's small for carrying along. You can put it in your pocket, but I prefer my padded carrying case. The screen is big enough to view your photos & go through menu options with ease. I do a lot of professional photography, modeling & the photographer & wanted something small to carry in my free time. This camera gives clear quality photos & excellent control. With a fast start up, you can shoot with manual mode or change the settings to your preferences. The memory card doesn't hold very many photos, so you should buy one that does. It'll definitely be worth the purchase. Remember you should go through your manual & learn all features. This will help you understand the features & modes much better. I am disappointed with the flash. Indoor/close up shooting, without the best of lighting needs tissue over the flash because its so close to the lens. WIthout doing so, the photo will be washed out, or have red eye. Without great lighting the photo may also have noise. This is pretty common with these new small handheld cameras. As a Photoshop user, I find no problem editing this.PROS:  *  Compact design  *  2.0-inch LCD Screen.  *  Rich photos  *  Great Battery Life - 14% more battery life than other SD series models. The life span on this battery is wonderful. It will last you hours. The charger that comes with the camera, charges very quickly & efficiently. The power saving setting automatically shuts camera off when not in use.  *  9 Scene Mode - Pre-set settings for you to use for specific areas & subjects. The new Night Display feature brightens the LCD in low lighting. (Pre-Settings: Portrait, Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Underwater, Indoor, Kid & Pets, Night Snapshot)  *  My Colors - Lets you highlight & swap colors right on the camera.  *  Shutter Exposure & ISO Speed  *  Color Balance - Make photos more vibrant, neutral, black & white, custom white balance, or sepia toned.  *  PhotoStitch- Stitch assist shooting mode which helps getting the shots lined up. These can be viewed on your LCD screen. Pictures that have been shot in this mode are also tagged with metadata which identifies them as sections of a single panorama, positions, left right up & down.  *  Supports other brand memory cards.  *  Quick Speed Movies, 640 x 480 Movies @ 30fps  *  USB 2.0 High Speed Support  *  37-111mm F2.8 - 4.9, 3x Optical Zoom.  *  50% Longer flash range versus the SD200-400.  *  Self timer - 2 Sec./10 Sec./Custom Sec.CONS:  *  32MB Secure Digital Memory Card. The size of this is pretty useless. Highest resolution gets you 9 photos. If you can afford this camera, you can afford to buy a larger memory card. The camera supports other brands/makers which will save you money.  *  Picture could be a little more sharp.  *  Could use faster shutter speed/frames per second.  *  Should have ISO Control & Macro in all modes.There are lots of great things about it & it will definitely suit any camera user. You should always check out merchandise in person at a local store if possible, to play with the camera & get the feel before buying. Overall, I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a new camera. The perfect gift for Christmas, birthday, or just any occassion.

I selected the SD500 mostly because it was on sale at the time, but i'm very glad it's what i ended up with.The one way in which this camera absolutely outperforms every other digital camera i've used is speed. Many other cameras wait a second or two between pressing the button and actually taking the picture. This is terrible when photographing anything mobile. With the SD500, barring low light conditions which require extra time, it really is point-and-shoot. The lag time between pictures is also lower than i'd come to expect based on other cameras.Overall, i'm extremely happy with the resolution, zoom, and all features of this camera. Every once in a while i play with the extras, the color-sync and such, but mostly i just use this camera to take normal pictures.I've docked one star from what would otherwise be a 5-star rating because of some physical issues. First, every once in a while, when i turn the camera on, the lens extends but the cover only opens part of the way. Usually turning the camera off and back on again resolves this.

Videos have a buzz/hiss in their sound. This seems to vary from one shot to the next and maybe from one camera to the next, but even at its best, it's pretty bad. I ended up buying an SD550 instead (no buzz in the audio) and I'm very happy I did.The 550 is a great little camera -- small, quick, convenient, easy to control. I didn't think the big screen would be as important as it is, but we like it a lot better than the smaller screen on the 500.There's a lot to recommend about both cameras. They're very easy to use in the manual mode. You can leave a group of settings programmed into 'manual' and then turn the knob and go to full auto, and then go back to the same group of settings for manual.One problem is that you never see a display of shutter speed and aperture. That's just silly. Another is that you can only see a histogram in playback.Both cameras are fast. I've used the 550 much more and can say that for the first time with a digital camera I feel that I'm not missing shots because the camera isn't ready.The metal surface of these cameras are slick and sophisticated. But, unfortunately, also very slippery, and combined with the shape of the camera, makes you always afraid you might drop it.Bottom Line -- Good camera.

It's metal except for the LCD and battery compartment.I spent weeks researching a small form factor camera that would supplement an SLR. I ended up narrowing the pack to the SD500, Sony  P200 and Casio Exlim 750 (the Pentax Optio S60 was not out at the time of purchase). Casio 750 is nice and small, fits in an Altiod tin, but it fails to deliver the color quality and consistency of the other two models. The Sony P200 had great features for the price, but would benefit from image stability to reduce image blur from hand held operation. I tested these at the local store after extensive online reviews.I finally settled on the Canon after taking just a few images. It was clear that both flash and non flash images acurateley captured the perceived subject's colors. I have had this camera for 3 weeks now and have taken about 150 pictures and a couple of videos at 640 x 480 at 30fps. You will want to purchase a few high speed 2GB SD card if you plan to do this often! Canon doesn't tell you that videos can only be captured up to 1GB at a time so get a Camcorder of you really want to capture continuous video.The most important feature of any camera to me is the color fidelity. I've found that I rarely, if ever need to edit images that come from the SD500 in Photoshop. I was in Walmart the other day and passed by their Photo center. I noticed that they had kiosk set up to take in images from digital cameras so I pulled out the little camera and took out the SD card, inserted it into the kiosk and loaded and selected a bunch of pictures for printing. Within an hour the 4x6 prints were ready. All I can say is \"Wow\"! The images were sharp, clear color was as expected/desired. My family was surprised to see the photographs we had just taken a couple of hours earlier.So far I've tried a few of the other features including color swap, continuous image capture, scene selection among others. The scene selection is adequate though adding more manual controls would make this camera a definite 5 STAR.Bottomline, the beauty of the SD500 is that images will be captured as perceived and can be sent directly for printing without any user color editing required.A Word on Megapixels:7MP is desirable if you need to create prints up to 8 x 10 at 300 dpi (dots per inch) which is typical of most laser and digital photo finishing printer. Don't be fooled by industry propaganda into thinking that a 3MP or even a 5MP is adequate for an 8 X 10 print. They are not! They can  print those size images but the quality will suffer versus a 7MP camera. The photofinishing printers will have to generate pixels (interpolation) to print on an 8x10 sheet of paper. [For the techie: an 8x10 is equivalent to 2400 x 3000 pixel image so your camera must be capable of producing this to prevent interpolation which causes loss in sharpness. ]*** Updated Jan 16, 2007 ***I took this camera to the Serengeti in Tanzania to take some great pictures of the wildlife as a backup camera. Great for the quick shots. I took 4GB SD cards and ended up taking a total of 2500 pictures! A great back up camera to a digital SLR. This would have been my only still camera if it had 10 x optical zoom.Picture quality after a year and half of use is fantastic.Battery life is great. Bought a backup battery.Get one of those screen protectors. I take my camera everywhere since it is so compact and you never know when a great shop opportunity will present itself. The screen is scratched but it's not noticeable when viewing an image.Great at taking movies but it eats the battery pretty. You will get only about 30 minutes of MPEG on a single charge.Note: 2400 x 3000 = 7,200,000 which is 7 Megapixels.Also, this camera does not support the new SDHC based SD cards otherwise I would have purchased one of the new 8GB SD cards. Stick with the 4GB SD cards!I would still rate this product a 4 star (A 5 star if it had the greater optical zoom).*** Updated December 25, 2010 ***Still takes amazing pictures. The Flash refresh seems to take longer than when new, but I use manual mode with flash set to off to eliminate flash refresh wait time.Occasionally the lens cover will not open all the way but I have taken this camera around the world and to the beach quite a number of times so I am sure the moisture rich environments have affected it. But overall am very pleased with the purchase and would do it again for a similar feature set.Only things missing are image stabilization, fast flash refresh, flash power adjustment and the ability to capture images in raw format. I would still rate the camera a 4 after 5 years of use! Way to go Canon.*** Updated February 9, 2013 ***After many trips to the Caribbean, a trip to Africa and additional harsh treatment, the lens will now sometimes not retract and I get an error message E10 and the lens no longer focuses. The images still can rival a Digital SLR in quality.I have since purchased a newer Canon Elph 320HS but I am not as pleased with it as I was with the picture quality from the SD500  which was a quality compact image capturing device!", "Date": "August 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "The one stop compact camera shop!", "Author": "Corpus Delecti \"Jones\"", "ReviewID": "R11GIFTLRVEYUZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon never fails to impress and this camera is no exception.  The image quality is as good if not better than many cameras even above its class.  The color rendition and white balance appear flawless.  The shutter speed (processor speed) is quick allowing you to be back on the photo within approx. 2 seconds.  It also has a very fast auto focus.  The review claims it will do a 60 second video.  With a 1gb SD card I was able to do a 10 minute video.  It seems to take as much video as you have room on your SD card.  A large SD card is a must for any 5 mega pixel plus camera and this is no exception at 7.1 megapixels.  SanDisk sells the 1GB version for $99.00.I recently bought the Sanyo Xacti at sharper image hoping for a duel solution video/stills at a proposed 5 megapixel stills and mpeg-2 video DVD quality video.  I took it back immediately as the pictures and video were sub par, and grainy to say the least.  The SD500 shot much better video (and that is just an extra benefit not its true intended use) and it shoots amazing stills.  I printed up an 8x10 on standard paper and it had great color, was sharp and crisp with no pixel artifacts to be found.The 7.1 size allows you to crop and manipulate photos without sacraficing quality for the reduction.  It will also shoot in RAW picture format for lossless image quality without compression.Even the software ZoomBrowser that comes with it is some of the best basic browser organizer software I've seen.  It supports PictBridge technology so my next purchase may well be the dye sub printer cp220 or 230 for the total package.It feels great in your hand with metal construction it feels and is a very solid quality made product.  I love the size as I know I can truly take it anywhere and always have it on the ready.  The great video feature was an added bonus for me and I'm sure I will use it quite a bit.  Another bonus is it shoots it and writes it to AVI so there is no capture needed on the other end.  Drag and drop it into your desktop, open your favorite edditing program and your off to the races.  I may buy a few more SD cards and forgo the camcorder purchase, as this is everything I need in a small space, for an overall great value considering the competition.

So I figured that Canon's SD500 line was better than the CF400 line -- that is, hope triumphed over experience.Just before the wedding, the SD500's screen stopped working, so after the wedding, I lent my Panasonic Lumix DMX-FX9 to my son-in-law for the honeymoon. The Panasonic came back from Jamaica in one piece. I haven't seen the Panasonic honeymoon pictures, but my daughter said that they are great.After the honeymoon my son-in-law sent the Canon in for repairs -- within the one-year warranty period. Panasonic said that he didn't have proof of purchase and that they'd charge him $200 to fix the camera -- now worth about $200.So a lousy quality camera (that takes great pictures when it works) is now matched with a lousy warranty support experience.

Well, the camera arrived 4 weeks ago and I have used it some, just around the house--taking pictures of the kids, pets, etc. I haven't done anything \"wild and crazy\" with the camera. Well, just this morning I got the camera out to take a few more pics and discovered that it's not working. I just get a weird marking on the screen (it looks like ink blots on a mostly blank screen). I let a camera-expert friend look at it and he thinks the camera is broken. I changed the SD card and battery and that didn't help. I poured through the technical manual and that was no help either. I called Canon's main number and talked to their technical support people for quite a while and they say the camera is broken too. Now I need to mail the camera off to get it repaired. After they receive it, it will take a minimum of 10 business days for them to repair it. Bottomline, it won't be able to be repaired and shipped back to me until AFTER we leave on the trip.

The pictures seemed great on the camera. But when they are uploaded to a computer or even printed directly from the memory card, the pictures are extremely dark. Dark greens are black. Objects clearly visible in light shadows on the camera screen are so dark you cannot see them on the uploaded or printed image. The image on the camera screen matches reality. The image the camera produces in reality is totally dark, especially in night or dusk scenes. You can clearly see the image difference when you hold the camera's image up next to what is supposed to be the same image uploaded onto the computer. So the camera left me with more than 400 ruined pictures -- an entire vacation (plus the holidays). By the time I returned from my trip, the window to return the camera was past, so I had to send it back to Canon (with me footing the postage bill) for repairs. It was returned, with a bunch of things supposedly replaced. Yet, the images are STILL dark and the same problem persists. For the amount of money I paid for this camera, I would expect it to work correctly out of the box. But this one is a real lemon. Had I wanted a refurbished camera, I would have paid a refurbished price. Instead, I got a full-price camera that doesn't even work properly. I have sent a request to Canon to see if they will outright replace the camera since it has not worked correctly since day one. No response yet. If I had to buy a digital camera again (and it is looking as though I really will have to), I would NOT buy the Canon PowerShot SD500.ADDITIONAL INFO (03/21/06):  Have so far sent this camera in for repairs TWICE... and it is STILL not taking pictures correctly.  The camera returned from the first round of Canon repairs with a new vibration and clicking noise when you turn it on and whenever the lens moves, as though there is something loose in the mechanism.  Problem persists with dark images (both on several different computers AND when memory card is taken directly to store to be printed).  Sent camera back for round two of repairs for both problems.  Have received it back and problems are STILL there.  This was obviously a flawed camera out of the box.  Canon should simply replace it, but refuses.
