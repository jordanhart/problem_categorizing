The camera and the lens are worth the buy. Some key items that make this deal great are the SD card, extra batteries with charger, bag, extra lens and the flash. I didnt care much for the tripod. The quality of that could have been better. But overall a great buy for the buck.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pass, find a better deal on the camera alone", "Author": "Mathew Brunetta", "ReviewID": "R351PK2UOX87P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All of the accessories were crappy. Bag was weak, lens adapters had a lot of artifacts.

From the kit I love that it comes with 2 extra batteries plus the one included with the camera which means you wont run out of power ever. The card is Ok, has work fine for me. The rest of the things included on the kit are low quality to the point of being on a bag on a corner of my room since I got them, the tripod doesn't support the camera it can't hold the weight its more of a point n' shoot tripod, the cleaning solution since I smelled and spilled on the package and saw it was oily I just put it aside, the rest of the cleaning kit are 5 cue tips and a towel not so nice. The bag is ok.I'm not sure if I'll get the kit if I was to buy the camera again low quality stuff with a wierd synthetic smell. Although the shipping was great I got it one day before low estimated delivery date!!!", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great package", "Author": "Isolino Ferreira - Goldrush Body Shop", "ReviewID": "R1V343UVMQ5F81", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this camera and the lens if perfect for my needs, now I don't have to carry around two lens as this one does the job of two and it takes great photos.  My only complain is the SD card that came with it was junk it crashed the first day I used it, I had to buy a photo recovery program to retrieve the photos, then I reformatted it and it crashed again, so in the garbage it went, and the two extra lens that came with with it are very low quality.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005AJ66OA"}}
