{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value, excellent vendor service", "Author": "Prismatic", "ReviewID": "RZ20RS74ZQFTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being on a budget and knowing that really good lenses are out of reach in addition to a $1200 camera body, this seemed like a great way to get this great camera and still be able to start shooting with it right away.  The camera and lenses alone make this package a great value.  Most of the rest of the items in this package seem pretty low end, but everything was exactly as advertised.  Cameta Cameras did a superb job of packing everything with plenty of bubble wrap in a heavy duty box which was taped securely, no dings or dents.The lenses are not high end, but because of the VR function still deliver sharp pictures in decent light.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FA5GXWO"}}
