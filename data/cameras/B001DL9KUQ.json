They advertise operation at 900 MHz, and they do, but they also transmit in the 800 MHz and 1800 MHz range which caused interference to nearby cellular and PCS towers.  As a result we can't use them.  It appears there is a good reason they don't cost much.  I would not recommend them.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Mediocre Range and feedback on the sound", "Author": "Steveo", "ReviewID": "R1736A0J2WQWPI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was easy to set up and it gave a clear picture during the day and at night.  The range is pretty bad; it says 100' indoors but I found it to be more like 50'.  There was feedback from the sound so I had to disconnect it.  I am returning this item because it isn't what I am looking for.  I will have to spend at least twice as much to get what I need.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good wireless picture and connectivity for low wireless price.", "Author": "L. Munson", "ReviewID": "R2ZDNT7TXEOM2A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I found this system to be better than expected in video quality and construction especially the bullet cameras. They are noted as 510H x 492V pixels and I noticed very good color match even at night in IR. When indoors I could see about twice as far as the advertised night range of 23 ft.  Also, at night through a window with the camera about 1 foot from the window I could see at least the specified night range. Transmission range performance through 2 inner walls at 50ft appears to be slightly fuzzy for the IR mode but clear in daylight mode.  The only interference I really notice is when I step up close to the receiver and get directly in line with the camera.  If you need to mount the cameras outside your home, consider that each camera power cord is 3ft long and each AC adapter cord is 6 feet i.e., there is 9ft of connected line from camera to adapter. This should be enough length to mount the cameras near the wall and have 3ft of camera cord to feed the connecting plug through the wall and inside the home so it will be safe and out of sight.  One drawback to the system has to be the receiver's camera select and mode switches.  They are located on the back of the receiver and are contained in a 3gang micro-toggle dip switch which is hard to operate. Two of the switches are on-off toggles for the display of camera 1 and camera 2.  The third is a mode switch. There are two modes, namely \"auto-loop\" (continuously cycles the display between the two cameras for about 6 secs. each) and \"hold\" (locks the display to the active camera at the time of toggling from \"auto-loop\" to \"hold\"). The active camera is indicated by one of two green lights on the top of the receiver.  The switches are difficult because they are physically quite small, too close together, stiff to flip and hard to get to as they are located between the power jack and the RCA audio connector.  Other than the switches being difficult, you might say that the cameras' field of view is not wide angle, the LEDs are the visible red type and the cameras are not ID'd. But none of these is really a show stopper.  The receiver itself is only about 5\"x4\"x1\" so it's very compact. There is an on-off switch in front and there is a video and an audio cable supplied for the outputs in back.  All this for a reasonable price makes me want to give it a 4 star rating but will give it a 3 because the system I bought was an opened box used item. It was returned for some reason. I don't know. They seldom state why items are returned.  All I know is that reliability in commercial electronics is only as good as the quality control.  Good Luck !", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001DL9KUQ"}}
