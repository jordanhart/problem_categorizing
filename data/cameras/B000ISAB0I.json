After having mine about a month, I'm just beginning to feel comfortable with it, although I've used smaller digital cameras and film SLRs for many years.Obviously you can't squeeze a 150-page manual onto both sides of an 8-1/2 x 11 inch sheet, so this Cheat Sheet's role is mainly as a reminder of things you've learned but forgotten, and also as a kind of index when you have to go back to the manual. It basically tells you which control or menu item does what you want to do.So the better you know your camera, the more useful this sheet becomes -- for instance, when you've forgotten which sub-sub-menu lets you change the maximum ISO setting or minimum shutter speed in Auto ISO mode ...It's easy to read and well-made -- looks like it'll last for years. It's actually more up-to-date than the Nikon manual, since it includes fixes for some manual errors. And I've found NO errors on this sheet, while I've found several dozen in the manual itself.", "Date": "January 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nikon D80 CheatSheet", "Author": "K.
