The camera looks (and is priced) more seriously than it performs. Polaroid should probably have played up the \"fun\" angle, made the body bright purple instead of silver, and aimed it obviously at kids or beginners.The image quality is not great. It's about as good as an average webcam. You need a lot of light. The images have a lot of compression artifacting (spotty patches) around the edges of objects. Colors don't reproduce well. As the camera holds only about 18 images at once, you won't be going very far from a PC for long. You can get some quite acceptable results if you: * shoot a single person or object against a simple background. Make the person or object as large in the picture as you can. You can sometimes get closer than the manual recommends. * Forget 320x240. It looks fuzzy and artifacted. Once you have the image in your computer, reduce the size until it appears sharper. Adjust the contrast and brightness to make it more distinct. * shoot in bright light with the light source behind you. Hold the camera as still as you can, or sit it on a flat surface or tripod. (This seems to be a factor with many budget digital cameras.)If you have basic needs, or just want a bit of fun, the 320 will probably be fine for you.", "Date": "December 23, 2000"}, {"Title": "Would be great as a free gift w/every magaz subscription!!!!", "Author": "Gretchen Luttrell", "ReviewID": "RIODV60MPPM7G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was just looking for the cheapest camera I could find.

I only got it for the Camera though!!! er.... and to see what I looked like in a bridal veil! He he!! ;-)So it doesn't have a screen on the back, a flash, a lens cover or more than 2 buttons! What it does do is take pictures that are good enough for the web or just keeping for memories. You won't want to print them out, as the resolution is not really good enough.I read these comments before I bought it, and came to the conclusion that the people who were ranting and raving about how 'bad' this camera was, were the type of people who don't belive in 'You get what you pay for'! I do, I didn't want to pay loads and therefore I'm happy! Especially as I only spent [price], which is about half a night out for me!The software is easy to use, and takes seconds to download or to delete. I get 30 pic's out of it easy. You need lots of light, so if you want to take pic's in a nightclub or in a bedroom when you get home (wink wink), get one that has a flash!!!!Well there we go, I'm no professional photographer, which is probably why I'm happy with this camera!

Gurgel", "ReviewID": "R1KKT6YO29YKWB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is an extremely simple camera.  It has two modes; the basic point and shoot mode, and a timer mode.  The pictures will not come out clear; you will not be able to see small details such as what is written on a sign in the picture even if you are reletively close to the sign.  You will also not be able to print out pictures much bigger than a couple inches in vertical and horizontal length.  Any bigger of a picture will be extremely blurry. This would be a great camera to buy for your kids.  They should find it fun to use and it is cheap for them to use since film is not needed.  This will save you a lot of money.  The battery life is great, since this camera lacks an LCD screen or flash.  I have used the same battery in the camera for the whole year that I've had it.  The lack of flash is a big problem, however.  Unless the subject of your picture is near a bunch of lamps or under a brighter light, you will be disssapointed at the outcome.  I've also found out that out of a batch of about 20 pictures, about 5 or 6 of them will not turn out very well for some unknown reason, even if you had adequate lighting. This can be very frustrating, especially if one of your more important photos does not turn out. A slow shutter speed also can be a problem.  The picture can be taken with an adequate shutter speed in good lighting, but I have found in a dimly lit room it is tough to take a picture of something that is moving without it being a big blur. If you are looking to purchase an easy to use camera that will take photo quality 5x7 and 8x10 prints, I would suggest the Fuji FinePix 2300.  This camera, like the Polaroid Digital 320, also comes with a starter kit.  The FinePix 2300 is a 2.1 mega-pixel camera. This is a very good price for a 2 mega pixel camera that takes very high quality photos. If you want photo quality 5x7 prints I would not go lower than a 2 mega-pixel camera.  Any camera in the 1 to 1.3 mega-pixel range should be adequate for emails and for posting on the web.
