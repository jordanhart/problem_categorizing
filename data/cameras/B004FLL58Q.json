I loved this camera for 5 months, then the LCD had problems.  Pink vertical bars obscured the lighter portions of the display (like any outdoor shot or inside with a window on a sunny day.  I have the $99 mini Kodak, and this LCD works fine in the same conditions, so I know it is a problem.It was too late to return, so I had to get it serviced.  Kodak service is terrible.  You can't speak to anyone, and have two lines to describe the problem.  I specifically wrote that pictures were fine, but LCD had a problem.  I had to send it (at my own expense) to a \"factory authorized service center\" in Indiana, even though I'm in California.  I used Google Street View to look this place up, and it's just a camera shop!  Any way, some weeks later, I got the camera back with a note \"lens replaced\", and the problem is still there.I emailed Kodak customer service & complained.  They emailed back that they were sorry and sent me a $10 coupon for my next Kodak purchase.

The camera has plenty of features, but not an overwhelming number. Resolution is excellent, both in pictures of cats and landscapes.  The screen is a bit difficult to see in full sun while wearing dark sunglasses, but I do not regard that as a defect.  The macro feature works well to resolve fine print on a business card (Note: turn off the auto-flash if you do this!).  The Kodak software (included) works well.I used an 8Gb Micro SDHC card, and the camera has a capacity of 1700 full resolution images.

The pictures come out with great quality. They are never blurry, even of my 3 year old. There's many different settings you can use to take pictures, including a fun photo booth option. I'm no professional and I've found the automatic setting to take the best pictures. It also takes videos, although not the best quality, it's the kind of quality you can expect from a camera like this. The charger is small and compact, it can plug into the wall outlet or the computer.

There M583 looked to be a fairly large improvement on the DX7630, smaller, lighter, more megapixels, zoom and a 28mm lens vs 35mm. Perfect! The M583 arrived quickly, but from the first dozen photos I realised that something was wrong. Toward the top RHS of the image, a circular blur was apparent in every photo, except for close ups. I was annoyed but I knew that the replacement process through Amazon was painless so I notified them of the fault and sent the M583 back for replacement.The replacement arrived quickly enough. However after I turned the M583 on, I tried to take a photo and....nothing. The shutter bottom was broken and would not push down at all. I decided at this point not to go for a third try and sent the M583 back and asked for a refund.This has severely diminished my respect for Kodak P&S; cameras. Whereas my DX7630 still soldiers on fine after 6 years and feels like it will last another decade or so, the M583 was a plasticky, poor quality device. It's a pity, because the pictures (other than the blurring) were pretty good but not as good as my DX7630 surprisingly. Thanks for forcing me to leave you Kodak...I eventually bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ10 (ZS7) which I couldn't be happier with and is MILES better than the M583.

No advanced programming mode but that's ok cause this is a compact camera and not a professional one. It has a programming mode but \"light and easy\".The wide angle lense really does its job. Indoor pictures are great even in \"automatic\" mode. No need to get far to cover great spaces or group of people.Movie format is MPEG-4. Ready for iPod & iPhone but if you want to display your videos as AVI or MKV, you will need to acquire a video converter. I used DivX Plus to convert files to MKV. The registered version offers AVI as well.Picture quality: great @ 14 megapixels! when viewing the pictures at the computer you can zoom on them at a great size before they get \"granny\". I tested the Panoramic feature and I got very impressed with it!Video quality: Sharp and colourful! I'm looking for the \"anti shake mode\" but still learning. Anyway, totally acceptable.Flash behaviour: the camera does control the intensity of the flash according to the enviroment and/or object distance.NOTE: it use a MicroSD card (NO a regular SD). I bought an 8gb Class 10 and works great with it.Compact, light weightThe menu dial is kind of small for big fingers. Users may gert confused between the Power button, the Movie Record button and the Shutter button. All three are aligned together.No Date In-Print for the pictures directly from the camera.

I'm really disappointed with the lag time when taking photos, though.  It takes a while to go from one photo to the next, because the camera takes so long to 'process' the last photo. It's resulted in me missing some 'moments', and taking photos in quick succession (e.g action shots) is a no-no . I've also had a few structrual issues, with the lens sticking at one point, and the camera crashing while I was taking a picture, and refusing to be shut off.

It takes sharp natural looking photos.Less than 2 weeks after receiving this camera it started having issues. First it would lock up with the lens extended, there was no image on the screen and the power wouldn't shut off. I removed the battery to cut the power and replaced it and it booted up and worked fine. This happened twice. Then the camera would boot but there would be no image on the screen. It would take a photo but the picture would be all black. I called Kodak support and they told me to send the camera in(my shipping expense) for repair or replacement with a refurbished unit, a process that is supposed to take about 3 weeks. I am concerned that the result may be a camera that is unreliable. I also feel they should have just replaced it due to the fact that it failed so soon after purchase.The camera was returned to me on April 9th and I assumed it was repaired. The camera was functioning and all appeared to be well. One week later on April 16th the camera froze again just as it had before sending it for repair. Then on April 22 the AC charging adapter stopped working. I was still able to charge the camera with the cord plugged into a usb port on the computer but the ac adapter is completely dead. On April 27th  I again called Kodak support and was told that I would need to send the camera back in again I was given an Activity Number, and told that I would receive an e-mail with instruction for return along with a prepaid mailing label.Six days later I had still not received the e-mail and the repair information and mailing label I was promised so I attempted to reach them on the Kodak support site using their chat function. When I logged into chat they said I was number one in the cue and that I would be helped by the next person available. I waited for 40 minutes until I was told that there was no support person available and to try back later.Next I used the support form on the Kodak support website. I filled out all the information and was told that I should hear from them within 48 hours. It has been six days and I have not heard a word from them. The camera is still not functioning and Kodak doesn't seem to care enough about their customers to even try to support the camera by following through on their promises.This is the third Kodak digital camera I have owned. I have also owned Canon and Nikon digital cameras. As of now I can not recommend this camera. Kodak support has been unresponsive to fixing there quality control issues. Your experience might vary, but then who knows? It pretty much depend on if you get a good camera or not. I would not take the chance again.There are many interesting features on this camera that I have not had a chance to test yet, The camera still has not had the defects repaired and Kodak support seems totally unresponsive.

It is fully capable of creating wonderful, high quality 14 megapixel photos. Its HD video is superb.Unfortunately, one needs to use Program mode to achieve this. All the automatic modes are awful, with very, very bad overexposure and odd colors. The film effect modes aren't worth using, and should not have been included. They aren't even half baked.The worst thing about the camera is its unwieldy interface. Simple tasks like changing white balance (essential for partly cloudy days), using the self timer, and adjusting EV become tedious ordeals of menu and button pressing activity. The interface imprisons users instead of serving them. It's sleek, animated, and unresponsive. Many menus are bigger than the display and require scrolling, so stuff is needlessly hidden. I often press buttons two or three times, thinking it failed to respond, then have to correct the mistake when it overshoots what I intended. It's a pain. The tiny buttons require a lot of pressure and are difficult to use.I hate how any change from single shot mode only works once. If I'm doing long exposure photography at night, I'd like to have the 2 second delay stay on. The camera forces me to laboriously switch it on through the menus for each shot, which gets old fast. I'd like to do candid street photography in burst mode, but it only works once, forcing more menu activity. It's awful.There is no infinity focus option. I could not take a picture of the full moon, since the auto focus system apparently didn't bother to try focusing at infinity. Even if it did focus, center weighted metering didn't work and the moon was just a featureless white dot at EV -2.0.Optical image stabilization doesn't work well. Videos made with a tripod look shaky when the camera needlessly moves the entire frame to keep up with moving objects. Many photos taken in sunlight are shaky. I wish the camera designers realized that telephoto images need short shutter speeds. Kodak decided to bias the camera in favor of low ISOs instead. I'd love to get black and white telephoto images at grainy ISO 800, but so-called \"Smart Capture\" cannot do it. I'm exhausted just thinking about how much work it would be to adjust the camera to do it in Program mode.Every interface activity requires confirmation, then you have to press and press and press buttons to get back up to the top of the menu to close it, then press \"DISP\" to finally make the menu go away. The team that built the pathetically clumsy interface apparently was unfamiliar with real world photography in changing light. I'd rather take pictures than get lost in menus.(Technological fantasy: I wish there was a simple 3 tab interface. Tab 1 has aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and a choice between auto focus and manually set focus distance. Tab 2 has ISO, saturation, contrast, sharpness, delay, burst, and flash. Tab 3 has rarely needed things like the picture size, JPG quality, clock, formatting memory, sound volume, display brightness, and gimmicky automatic modes. Simple four way arrow buttons cycle through the options, which immediately go into effect and stay that way without confirmation. Kodak evidently feels slowing down photographers as much as possible with multiple menus and submenus is a better way to go.)I like how there is no video mode. It simply records video using the current settings, so smart capture and film effect modes will work to make arty H.264 MP4 files. Program mode works slightly better than Smart Capture, but white balance and EV choices look different and worse than still photos. \"640x480\" looks more like 320x160 interpolated to 640x480. 720p video frames are very blocky compared to stills scaled down to 1280x720.The M583 is very strong in certain situations. The T-MAX film effect is great with black, white, and silver subjects. Midtoned subjects in soft light always end up weak and horribly overexposed.I haven't seen any purple fringing yet. CCD blooming happened on some night video, but it wasn't too bad. The videos are very clear and noise free. They make beautiful 2D to 3D conversions with YouTube.The camera froze once and the lens failed to retract twice on the first full day of testing, so I'm not optimistic about its product life. I'll update the review if there are any problems.I love the treasures of photography and video this camera is giving me, but I can't overlook how much annoying effort is needed to get them. Canon and Pentax have figured out how to make camera adjustments easy. Why can't Kodak? I wish some company would simply make a pure black and white digital camera with a prime lens and one ISO only. The only adjustments (aperture, shutter speed, and focus distance) would be on manually operated dials. Digital engineers ruin and slow down everything with complexity.- - -Update after 1 month: I lowered the rating from 4 to 2 stars. I wanted to smash the camera against the ground yesterday. I want the camera to be out of my life. I hate how it insists on pointlessly displaying the mode name and how much storage space is left for 7 seconds every time it's turned on. I have good short term memory. I'm aware of what mode I'm using. I format the card after every session. I don't need that information blocking my view 100 times a day. It's bad enough that the information is forced onto the screen, but Kodak thoughtfully included black gradients to cover up even more of the image.The camera also froze after I thought I took a photo. It couldn't be turned off without opening the door and removing the battery. I hate this product. It is badly designed, poorly made, and a nightmare to use. Even when it works, video quality is horrible and still photos have way too much noise reduction. I'd love to make noisy ISO 400 - 800 black and whites in marginal light, but the camera wrecks them and won't let me get the results I want. Color photos in good light look weird thanks to flattened out detail the camera presumes is noise.I can't get used to the menu. If I leave the white balance, saturation, or ISO setting on one square, I expect it to be there when the menu is displayed again. The active square is always on the left, so I have to think carefully about which direction to move, since my current setting is not highlighted. It's a terrible interface.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this Camera", "Author": "Jeffrey Yanez \"Artist\"", "ReviewID": "R3N6Q6UUXI1FT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several brand named point and shoots as this camera but I love this one the most.It is so easy to use and as a professional photograper I love the compact size, One of my other cameras cost over $5,ooo.oo dollars just for the body and i will say that I love that camera too.

However if your looking for something that you can send pictures wirelessly and flawlessly this might not be for you.  It does seem to lag and or not work at all in that department.  (I've only tired the e-mail and twitter share app.)  Despite the fact that I'm disappointed in the lack of wireless capabilities I do like the camera enough to over look that deception and I also feel there is enough pro's to outweigh the con's so I'm not 100 percent disappointed.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy point and shoot to use", "Author": "dr.erskine", "ReviewID": "R27LHAJPQNA464", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fourteen big megapixels make shooting with this camera a breeze.

I needed a camera that is compact enough to fit in her purse or diaper bag, fast enough to catch a 19-month old in motion (without blurring, thank you...)and easy to use. The EasyShare M583 meets all those criteria, and adds a couple of bonuses, like an 8X Optical zoom. Most cameras in this price range offer alot of zoom, but optical zoom is what gives you sharp pictures and this camera has twice the amount of optical zoom as most cameras in its price range. It also offers image stabilization and takes pretty good video.The only cons I can think of are:- It uses a proprietary rechargeable battery, so if you run out of juice, you can't just run out and get a couple of Triple-A's to tide you over.- The body is mostly plastic. While it seems sturdy enough, I'd feel better with a metal body.In conclusion, this is a great camera for the money.

I bought this instead from Amazon for under $70, and it is a great little camera for the money.  The pictures are clear, high-resolution, and the camera has a nice optical zoom / image stabilization system.  In addition, it INCLUDES A MEMORY CARD AND A CASE!  I looked online beforehand to try to verify this and could not, so I ended up ordering a memory card from Amazon too (that's now in the Wii).  In the end, you really can't go wrong with this camera for the price.So, why did I only give it 4 stars?  For 2 reasons - First the auto-share button only has limited functionality...I tried to upload a video to YouTube using the Share button, and it said it was no longer supported (it also no longer supports Twitter or Flickr).  Second, the warranty on this camera is going to be serviced through a 3rd party since Kodak is in bankruptcy and exiting the digital camera business.  That's not great, but honestly it is unlikely that the camera will break in the next year unless my daughter drops it, and even if it does break and I can't get it serviced under the warranty, I'm not going to lose too much sleep over it considering I bought it for less than $70.
