During the winter the camera quit. Other dislikes are: If elec goes off, it will not reset.  Shadows and wind will start the camera, a lot of false recordings.  Can't play back all of recorded events.  Tried to call 800 number in manual, not available.  Tried three other numbers, finally got to leave a message which was never returned.

It will accept up to 4 cameras. You only get one camera with this model, but you can purchase additional. It's nice to see who/what comes on your property while you're home or away! The night vision works fantastic also since it is motion activated..", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works as advertised, BUT expect limited life", "Author": "A. Ruggeri", "ReviewID": "R58NNPYL13XXW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera two years ago.  It worked as advertised and the microphone would pick up conversations 30 yards away on non windy days.  The problem is it broke after 1 1/2 years, 6 months out of warrenty.  I called customer service and they said they replace the unit within the first year.  After that they told me \"it is time to buy a new unit.\"  Over $200.00 for a life of 18 months, give me a break.  Spend your money elsewhere.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "big chip \"big chip\"", "ReviewID": "R2TZ6Y7M7ART7C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buying a 2nd camera for this system. Searching for best price (amazon of course).I purchased the origional unit in a store. It worked great. Winter came,temp. fell to -10. Camera failed.Made 1 call to first alert. talked to one of the tech's. He seemed suprised and sent me a new camera. He requested return of old one for examination at the lab. Dont know if it was a \"story\" or not.New one worke's fine even in colder weather than the -10 below. Have it operating outside, on the wall of my garage 24/7 for 3 years. NO problems since. Highly recommend this unit.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great system for low price", "Author": "Kelly Albrecht \"bunneegirl\"", "ReviewID": "R2VW2QN6C9T8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to give some positive feedback on this system, especially since the two reviews here are questionable now. One review complains that the photo shown with the product is wrong but it looks like Amazon has corrected this, so giving a low rating for that doesn't make sense anymore. Yes it was important at the time the reviewer posted, but now that the photo is fixed, the product is getting dinged for no reason.The other reviewer complained that wind and shadows set the motion detector off. Well, YES, that's kind of the point. When we installed this system at my parents' home, we took into account the fact that the wind swishing through nearby trees would set off the motion detector. It's not the camera's fault you have landscaping that MOVES or makes shadows near the camera. It is up to the buyer to place the camera in a location where this does not affect the operation of the system.With all that being said, I was surprised at how good the picture is on such an inexpensive system. We knew someone with this system and when I saw how it worked, I assumed it would be much more expensive and was surprised to find out how little it costs. For the money I don't think you can find anything better!", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "security camera takes great photos.", "Author": "norman s.", "ReviewID": "ROIRTHHXA7MY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "descent price and easy set up. takes great photo,s. set my up to take photos by motion sensor.would buy another 1.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "It served it's purpose.", "Author": "Kaylee McConnell", "ReviewID": "R3JEIF1UKH319S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was unfamiliar with surveillance equipment.  I thought wireless meant battery operated, but it doesn't.  No wires are needed between the monitor and the camera.  However both units need to be plugged into electical outlets.  The instruction booklet assumes that you already know how to use the device.  However once the monitor is turned on, the screens are logical and easy to work through. You can set brightness, resolution, how long it records, etc.  I was trying to find a lost, traumatized all black pet cat that a caregiver had let out of my house while I was on vacation.  I had canvased the neighborhood and someone thought he had seen him in an abandoned truck behind a large barn in the woods.  The food I put out kept disappearing but I could not find what was eating it.  I placed the camera inside the truck cab aimed at the feeding station.  It took a couple of electrical cords run from a nearby shed.  The monitor was placed in the shed. (I tried putting it in the neighbor's house but got no reception.)  Distance between the camera and monitor will vary depending upon interferences.  I set it to record for 15 seconds once it detected motion.  Within 2 hours I identified my cat.  The color screen displays remarkably clear images for such a small unit.  It recorded a mouse and even a moth.  The night vision shots are almost as clear as the day shots.  You can attach as many as 4 cameras recording simultaneously on a screen split into 4 areas.  The alarm sound can be turned on or off.  A 2GB storage card is included.  There is a date/time stamp on all images.  I am quite satisfied with this product.  I found my cat!", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazon has the wrong photos!", "Author": "AJ Tundra", "ReviewID": "R2TS8RPVYOYQGQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a ONE CAMERA system, not two cameras.

Easy to use from start to finish", "Author": "MorganRentals", "ReviewID": "R29KT67WZEWW19", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased the 702 camera system (2 cameras) for our rentals located on a dead-end street. We live 3 houses away and the system works wonderfully from our house to the rentals. I like the alarm when the recording starts. I have purchased systems since then, that do NOT have the alarm feature and I think \"what's the point?\" You can choose how long to record (5, 10 or 15 seconds) and how long the alarm goes off... as well as if you want to view 1 camera at a time or 2,3,4. I've just purchased another 1-camera unit with an extra camera because I cant find the 2-camera unit for sale anywhere. All the videos are recorded onto a SD card that you can put into your computer and transfer the videos if you need to. We have been very very happy with this system and are sad to find out that they are getting harder to find, soon to be extinct.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "First Alert DW-700, Simple - No Frills", "Author": "M. Whitfill", "ReviewID": "RB9V6LPVA7SOB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This DW-700 system so far has been operating OK. Just remember it is wireless (more subject to interference, low range, low resolution, easily hacked). Purchase a wired system if you want better of the previous mentioned items.  If you want to move the monitor to a different location, just unplug it from the 110v wall socket to another 110v socket, problem is you wont get as far away from the camera as the owner manual states.  The monitor is very easy to pick up and watch hand held, but you wont be able to distinguish facial features, just able to know if the subject is two legged or four legged, not unless the subject is very very close to the camera.  It is not a true statement entirely that you cannot see the infared light, and the camera is able to see in complete darkness. Yes, the camera can see in complete darkness and you can't, but  you can see the camera in the darkness because all the green and red l.e.d.'s emiting the infared are lighted up and you can see where the camera is.  If you want to add another camera, (because of this systems limited range and the expense of that other camera) it would be wiser to buy another DW-700 system and program it's camera to a different location on it's monitor than the other one, this way you can separate the two cameras away from each other as far as you want as long as there is a 110v wall socket at that other location.  Time will tell if this is a dependable product, but as its working now, I would highly recommend this system to anyone wanting an affordable (compared to other high priced units) very simple, very easy to set up and get running, and very simple to move to a different location.  Bottom line, you can get a lot better system, at a lot greater price, with a lot more complications getting it up and running, and a lot less portability.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$336.37", "Features": "4 channel system allows consumer to add up to 4 cameras and view simultaneously\nBuilt-in audio surveillance allows consumers to hear disturbances\n2 GB SD card allows consumer to easily record video\nLED night vision technology allows consumer to view up to 40-Feet even at night\nSleek  7-Inch LCD screen provides easy viewing and simple product set-up\nFirst Alert DW-700 Digital Wireless Security Recording System With 7-Inch LCD Display\n4-Channel System Allows Users To Add Up To 4 Cameras & View Simultaneously\n7-Inch LCD Screen Provides Easy Viewing & Simple Product Setup\n2 Giga Byte SD Card\n56 Viewing Angle", "Name": "First Alert DW-700 Digital Wireless Security Recording System with 7-Inch LCD Display", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GnGU-KD1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003NCWPNC"}}
