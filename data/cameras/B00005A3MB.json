This camera is not built nor, has it ever been advertised as having enough pixel capacity to create great detailed hardcopy photos.  This camera,  because of its limited resolution is strictly meant for use to make quality jpeg pictures which can be quickly e-mailed or uploaded to a webpage.  If you want detailed, crisp hardcopy pictures you had better be looking at a 3.3 meg camera at a minimum and a very high quality color dpi printer as well and the cost of those two together will run you 2k!This camera does EXACTLY what it is meant and advertised to do - provides superb jpeg quality pictures for web and email purposes.  You'll never get great hardcopy photo quality with a 2meg camera,  there is no such animal!If you are strictly looking for a camera with incredible ease of use and simplicity to post pictures on the web without hassles, usb cables, downloading software BS...etc... then this is your camera.  If you are looking for great hardcopy photo quality pictures try something along the lines of the Sony MVC FD95 or better.I strongly suspect the people who have written bad comments about this camera did not do their homework before buying it.  Had they done so,  they would have known that there is not a 2 meg camera on the market which produces true hardcopy photo quality pictures which even come close to 3.3 meg picture quality because there simply isn't enough pixel resolution available.

Now obviously it's not the choice.The camera used for web only should not cost that much money even though it has 10x optical zoom (the expensive factor) I would rate it 5 stars now if its price was lower than $100.Ask yourself these questions:- Why do you buy it when you can buy another camera w/ higher resolutions at the same or lower price (e.g Finepix 2600, 2650,2800...) so you can print really good 4x6 pictures & sometimes 8x10?  Of course you can use your picture for web pages...- Who need the outdated floppy disk now?  I guess the floppy drive won't be available computers in the future. It just makes the camera so bulky. Of course its low capacity can be used only for low resolution pictures.

You get back to your hotel or maybe a relative's house and want to load the pictures onto a PC to e-mail them to your friends and relatives.  How easy is that?  With the 'memory card'-based cameras, sure you can fit 100 high quality images in your camera, but then to get them off the camera and onto the PC, you need a hookup cable (and the proper port on the PC you plug into) PLUS the software CD included with your camera.  Even with those things, you have no guarantee it'll work to hookup to that particular PC.  Contrast, with diskettes as your media, you not only have universal compatibility with every PC on the planet, you also do not have a speicific limit to the number of pictures you can take (since you just keep feeding in diskettes as if they were 'film').  A diskette is also FAR cheaper than a memory card or even traditional film.  The other big selling factor which goes along with the compatibility issue is the ease of use.  The menus are intuitive and things aren't that much different mechanically than a standard camera.  You can learn as you go without paying any penalty really.  I'm totally sold on the diskette approach depite the fact that I can only fit maybe 15 'fine' quality images on one diskette.  I don't mind, because the virtually unlimited storage (limited only by the number of diskettes you have with you), is awesome.What's not to like?  Because of the diskette drive which is embedded in the camera, it's bigger than many other digital cameras, making it tough to just slip in your pocket. On the flip side, it's not going to get lost easily either.  The image quality leaves a little to be desired, but most entry-level digital photographers won't be disappointed.  The image quality is more than adequate for e-mailing shots of the family to friends and relatives, and there are several settings which can help, namely \"fine\" quality setting, and \"bitmap\" format.  Those two, while bigger, produce good looking results.  For action shots or basic candid photos at evens, you can get 30 pictures with 'standard' quality JPEG settings.For the price, up to half as much as many digital cameras out there now, this Sony camera is worth a look.

As a result - the camera sat in the cupboard unused.THEN - we got the Mavica! Now, one class can take pictures with it, remove the disk then pass it to another class for immediate use. We found that a disk usually holds around 30 to 40 images, and although the print quality at this resolution is not *fantastic* it is still good enough for use on displays around school and is ideal for taking pictures for use on the school's website.The camera is sturdy enough to be used by children, and easy enough for them to use unsupervised, and is still working well after many school trips and the occasional exposure to rain!We haven't had any problems with the LCD screen becoming scratched - although it can get a bit dirty with fingerprints from time to time - but these can be wiped off with screen cleaner.Battery life is good - it is easy to re-charge and charges up quickly.There are no wires or cables and no software needs to be installed on your computer - just shove the disk in your A-drive and you're away. It HAS to be simple for the un-technically minded or it wouldn't get used - this camera rarely goes back into the cupboard it is used so much!

Of course you can buy a smaller camera today with more features and a higher megapixel count.  However, the FD75 is still a good choice for several applications.1.  It's built like a tank.  Mine has clearly had heavy use over the years, and it still works perfectly.  This durability is ideal for commercial and industrial applications, which is why realtors and insurance adjusters used these cameras for many years after they supposedly were obsolete.  The large size also makes it easy to grip and less likely to get lost, bouncing around in the back of someone's car.2.  In these days of \"administrative privilege\" and \"device not recognized,\" a camera that stores images on floppy disks is the ultimate in simplicity.  There's no need to \"install\" a new device or call the IT department for \"authorization.\"  You just pop the disk in and it works.  Newer laptops and notebooks of course no longer have floppy drives, but this is (or should be) a commercial and not a personal camera.  Many businesses still use desktops which typically come with floppy drives.  The .3 MP size is also ideal for e-mail attachments.  It's not intended to take vacation photos - but it's more than adequate for an insurance adjuster who has to send two dozen shots of a wrecked automobile to an attorney, or a realtor who wants to send photos of a house to a potential buyer in another state.  Even today, most cameras, including professional-grade DSLRs, have a .3 MP option just for this purpose.3.  The 10x optical zoom on this model is competitive with many of today's cameras, and better than many modern compact cameras.  Zoom is like money:  \"it's better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.\"Aside from the commercial applications, considering the low price for a working used model, this is a great choice for a child's first camera or for someone who has never used a digital camera and doesn't want a steep learning curve.  Until a manufacturer decides to buck the miniaturization trend and put out a modern version with these same features, these old Mavicas will be irreplaceable.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mavica FD 75", "Author": "Gloria", "ReviewID": "R3QVW7QM2VV33C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "People who claim you don't get enough shots, or they are not good quality, are NOT good photographers, and do NOT have it set right!

I highly recommend it whether you are just beginning or are a seasoned expert.The main and most important feature for me is that I can both shoot and store all my photos on floppy disks, thus insuring that I can ALWAYS easily print from any computer and any source without fussing over memory cards and compatibility or plugging the camera into a computer.  The Mavica gives you great flexibility in this regard and my photos are always backed up both on floppies and other media if I choose.\"Picture Effects\" offer choices of black & white, sepia, solarised,or negative modes and give the amateur easy imaging options with just clicking on the \"Effects\" button.Viewing your photos is very easy, just scroll through individual photos or view with the index, which shows 6 thumbnails at a time.Depending on the mode chosen, \"Standard\" or \"Fine\" you'll get anywhere from 10 to 30+ exposures per 1.4mg floppy disk.  \"Standard\" works well for most shots and \"Fine\" gives you clear, sharp images with good color balance.  You can add a polarising filter (recommended for all lenses!) and increase color control through appropriate filtration.Copying a photo or the complete disk is also very easy, just choose from the menu what you want to copy...You can choose from several auto-modes (fast action, low-light, bright light, etc.) protect files from accidental erasure, adjust exposure levels manually, add polarising and other filters and lenses, adjust the screen brightness, time-stamp your photos, and other goodies; and the Mavica FD75 does very well at close-up photography as well.Altogether, a good choice for anyone wanting an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand camera with a floppy disk capability.
