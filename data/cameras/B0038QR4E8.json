Initially, the system was fine, very easy to install the software, although the color was a bit washed out even at close range. Camera 2 failed after 2 weeks having an audio noise issue (loud buzzing & pops) no matter where it was placed. Emailed the seller on 05/10/2010 about the lack of warranty information and phone number for customer service. No response (Chowaka LLC). On 05/20, camera 4 stopped transmitting video either wireless or cable and was very hot to the touch. I assume the circuit board had a power issue or compenant failure; the audio is still functioning.Do not buy this system; no warranty, no phone numbers, no customer service from Chowaka. We have filed a claim with Amazon and will purchase a different system.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Look Somewhere Else!", "Author": "Usmarine0622", "ReviewID": "ROQMJ18AWT15A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had problems installing the drivers on 4 different computers, there's next to no tech support.

The pictures in the description are phony, COMPLETELY, the \"IR\" camera night vision is hilarious, its just some low level led's that put out just enough light to get a slight out line on the fuzzy and completely distorted screen. You have to option of wiring the camera right to the hub and even if they are wired, it is completely distorted and you arent able to see anything anyway.
