The one upset reviewer must have gotten a faulty one because mine works perfectly. Out of all the quick-shot cameras I've had, this one does best in low lights. It also captures colors well. There are a lot of different things you can experiment with. You just have to mess with it a bit and see the settings that you like. (and for those that care, the white color is gorgeous and it has a good texture. The screen is also very nice)", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "yerocer", "ReviewID": "R17X1DXBSHRKJN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Super small, got this for my gf to keep in her purse.

Moss", "ReviewID": "RHDTD4FGP7MVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The pictures are very crisp.  I like all the features that my last point and shoot did not have.  The HD video is clear, and looks very good.  There are a lot of (optional) manual settings which I like, like f-stop, aperture priority, shutter priority, fisheye setting on video, a setting to make skin appear smoother in portraits, and many more.  I bought this for my mom, played with it and immediately bought one for myself.  Love it.  Smaller than a pack of cigarettes.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "I was SOOOOO HAPPY that I purchased a replacement camera!", "Author": "M. Bosque \"Miklos\"", "ReviewID": "R3DHCITIPIN09R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I never imagined that digital cameras could have changed so much, but as I prepared for winter in South America, I decided to find a less cumbersome camera... After searching, and reading Amazon reviews, I settled on the Samsung ST77...and WOW!  What a difference.The ST77 wasn't so small that it was difficult for my big hands.  But it was small enough to pack around comfortably for a few months.  And, I have a new favorite feature that I would not be without, every again, in a camera -- the ability to take a \"Panoramic\" picture.  This feature adds so significantly to telling a photo-story, and it's easy, easy, easy to use.  Other features of import... a close-up capability, night-time/low-light pictures, and a large viewing screen.  And, a great deal too from the Amazon vendor, with prompt delivery!", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "R. H. \"planner\"", "ReviewID": "R1IG06JTJ3TJRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased especially for a Europe trip. Wanted small with high pixels. Easy to carry securely. Most importantly - set it on auto and snap away. I was especially impressed with the pictures in low light without a flash (museums and churches often prohibit flash if they allow pictures at all). I deleted two pictures out of about 500 which were blurred. The rest were extremely clear and more than met my needs. This is a great little camera for the price.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Short battery life when not in use", "Author": "Hobe", "ReviewID": "R2P1MIIOBPGA9R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera takes great photos.  Only problem I have found is the battery life is short when camera is off and not being used.  I keep the camera in a drawer when not in use and find the battery mostly discharged after 2 weeks.

I love the sizeand the color ( it has lots to choose from), but the camera itself is a little more complicated that I wished for.

It is awful!A complete waste of money! You have the option of getting clearer pictures OR having the date on them and the clearer pictures are usually blurry. The last 20 I took you could barely tell there was a person in them. Its ridiculous and I'm going to have to try to get a Samsung refund. A camera that can't take halfway decent pictures? I just take pictures of friends and family. I'm not asking too much of it. Seriously though. Don't waste your money. Its hard to get a good picture with this \"camera\".
