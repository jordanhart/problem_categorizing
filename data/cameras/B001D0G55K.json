{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, but not great", "Author": "Jim Larsen", "ReviewID": "R2R9K88WOZ3H81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good small point and shoot camera for the price.  It is easy to use, has a very clear menu, and a very large LCD display.  If you are looking for a 5X zoom with simple menus and an extra big display, this is a great deal.  The downside with this camera is that the picture quality is not as good as more expensive cameras, and it does not do well in low light situations.  The flash has an effective range of 9.8 feet.  Beyond that range the picture will have poor focus or lots of digital noise.  It says it can do 1600 and 3200 ISO, but the quality goes down in those situations.  The manual says that even in 10 MB Fine mode (highest resolution) they don't recommend enlarging beyond 8 x 12 prints (which was the limitation of my last 3MP Olympus camera).  It is nice and compact and easy to use.  You will be happy with it as a snapshot camera, but you will want to spend more if you are a serious photographer.  I have rated this a 5 because I think you get what you pay for.  Even with its limitations, it is a great camera for the price.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Small camera - big punch", "Author": "Toothless \"OldMan\"", "ReviewID": "R2DXZLR59KR3LM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great point and shoot camera.  Small enough to fit comfortably in a shirt pocket and capable enough to capture the fleeting moments of life and preserve them forever more.  Wide angle makes pictures of groups much easier to take.  Picture quality is great and with ten mega pixels a picture can be cropped to capture only the desired elements and still look good. Battery life is very long, but when it is about done it depletes quickly.  Best option would be to have an extra charged battery with you.One improvement that could be made is to the internal flash.  It works for pictures of ten feet or under, but the light falls off quickly after ten feet.  But this is a point and shoot camera and if you need to take flash pictures at greater distance, get a studio digital camera with a separate flash attachment.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!!!", "Author": "A.

Within a few days of buying the Fuji I regretted it.The flash creates very washed out indoor pictures. I was shocked when I saw the first shots of our baby- my old Canon had much better colour definition with flash. Even non-flash pictures didn't have the quality I was used to, parts of the image were lacking definition, certainly not printworthy. In addition, the lack of a viewfinder means you are totally reliant on the LCD display to take pictures, which is useless on a sunny day- the screen just looks black, you can't actually see what you're trying to shoot. We ended up taking pictures of garbage cans and bushes instead of our son!We returned the camera in favour of the Canon we originally intended to buy.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD CAMERA", "Author": "R.

Reeves", "ReviewID": "R7Q05KSPLJOUI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I didn't like this camera and sent it back.  The pictures were very inconsistent - I took two pictures of the exact same thing at the exact same time and they each turned out different - with different lighting and coloring.  Also, sometimes the flash was so bright it whited out the subject's face and you could hardly see them.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Really good starter camera", "Author": "S.Amicucci", "ReviewID": "R2PW3Q2HNJBA8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So a few years ago i really wanted a camera because i did not have one. I like to do a lot of research about what im looking for before i buy it. So i found this camera and it works really well. The pictures are amazing and the zoom is real nice. Its slim and slides right into your pocket. I have a case for mine because i did not want it to get messed up because it looks so nice. Once i took some photos with it, one of my friends had a old Nikon D200 laying around and gave it to me to use. She really liked the quality of what this small camera showed and thought it was time to step up. So over all if you want a really good point and shoot camera without breaking the bank, then i think you should get this camera. I will even post some photos that i took with it to show how good it is. Some of the photos i changed the color around.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "tth29", "ReviewID": "RXS81JCPGGN1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a gift because I own one myself and love it.  It takes great pictures and is very reasonably priced.  My only complaint about this camera is the lag time of the shot.  Sometimes the subject has moved on before the flash/shutter snaps ruining the shot.  Of course, this is a point and shoot not a digital SLR so that is expected across all brands, not just this one.  For the price it's a minor, although sometimes aggravating minus.  Overall I love it and think it is well worth the price for picture quality and portability.  Would definitely recommend.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great product for the price", "Author": "David Hollander", "ReviewID": "R397COW3KBLAQE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes pictures that are very crisp looking until enlarged beyond a standard 8.5\" x 11\" paper size.  It has a generous amount of functionality although I would have liked the option of changing the shutter speed in the manual shooting mode.

It's clarity is fantastic at 10 MP, the zoom lens is easy and clear, and most important it has a larger screen on the back than any camera we have previously owned.  It's size is thinner than other cameras and about the same other dimensions.
