(You can start it loading and leave it alone, though.) I have a very fast computer and could take 30 seconds to dowload a  picture from camera. 2 Uses batteries up quickly.  You can use up 4  penlites in an hour of heavy use (especially if you use the view-screen on  the back - that is what really uses the power up).  (Not any different from  other digital cameras from what I read.) 3 Very little documentation, not a  problem for me, since I wouldn't read anyway, but others may want to read  more about it.NOTE: I searched around and other online retailers had  lower prices up front, but after you add shipping and taxes (yes taxes on  some sites) you end up paying more than on Amazon.  So I bought from  Amazon!  Plus, Amazon delivered quickly of course, and I don't know how the  other guys would do as far as customer service.Number of pictures:  With  the 4 megs built in, you can take 12 XGA superfine, 25 XGA fine, 50 XGA  normal - 22 VGA superfine, 45 VGA fine, 90 VGA normal.Extra pictures: It  uses CompactFlash Cards. Can buy to add Megs of memory to hold more pics.  (approx $ per meg for the CompactFlash cards) Amazon and others also sell  these.", "Date": "December 15, 1999"}, {"Title": "Polaroid PDC 700 is a digital wonder.", "Author": "STEPHEN J. SMITH", "ReviewID": "R3IH637LDYK668", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the PDC 700 with all kinds of limitations in mind, first and foremost being cost.  I was not going to pay over $300 for a digital camera and I wanted the highest resolution for the least amount of money.  I found exactly that with the PDC 700.  I also bought three Sandisk 16 mb flash  cards, a 32 mb flash card, a battery charger and sufficient nimh batteries,  and a Datafab compact flash reader (parallel).  This last weekend, I  started taking pictures of everything around my house and office.  EVERY  picture I took on medium resolution far surpasses the picture quality I  ever had with 35mm SLR cameras.  The printed pictures were also fantastic  on my Lexmark Z11 printer....  Bottom line, I can take an  infinite number of pictures at a wonderful resolution, crop them if  necessary using the Photoshop LE look-alike software included with the  camera, and print great pictures the quality of which I have never seen  before at a wonderfully low price.  This camera is indeed a quality  product.  The only drawback is the case - it is too small for anything but  the camera, so I bought a larger camera bag that holds all the accessories.", "Date": "June 19, 2000"}, {"Title": "A few improvements and it'd be excellent!", "Author": "Sneaky", "ReviewID": "R2JE197KSI7HF3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Polaroid did a pretty good job on this camera. Let's break it down step by step:ADVANTAGES:1) 4 MB built-in memory - this is a fair amount compared to other comparable cameras.2) Compact Flash compatible for  adding more memory - Compact Flash cards are relatively inexpensive - it's  like film you can use forever! Just drop it in, take the pictures, and when  the card fills up, replace it (or use the 4 MB built-in).3) The LCD  display is great. Not choppy - you can even adjust the brightness. It can  be turned off to decrease battery drain. Also, immediately after you take a  picture, it will display the picture on the LCD (whether you have it on or  off) and ask if you want to delete it now? This is great when you take a  picture and look at it and immediately know you don't want it.4) Menu  functions. Once you figure it out, the menu is really cool. You change what  type of light you will be taking pictures in, you can format the memory,  erase all or one picture in the camera, etc.5) The software is great.  You can actually hook your camera up to your computer, and from the  software you can change the camera settings without ever touching the  camera (you can take a picture, turn on/off the lcd display, change flash  formats and picture quality, etc.).6) Accessories. The kit comes with a  TV cable, a nice camera case, a wrist strap, a serial (RS-232) cable for  camera-computer connection, BRAND-NAME batteries (that's a shocker - I got  Duracell ULTRA with mine), AC Adapter, and software. There is also a USB  port as well - I'm going to look into this because serial transfer is  SLOW....DISADVANTAGES:1) Slow downloads. I have a PII-400 w/ 128MB  RAM. Still, I downloaded 15 1024x768 (Fine quality mode - read more about  quality modes further down) pictures that I took, and it took almost a  minute per picture.2) There are 2 settings: 1024x768 (they call this  XGA), and 640x480 (they call this VGA). Each of these settings also has 3  quality modes (SuperFine, Fine, and Normal). SuperFine is the only one  worth taking pictures with. Other modes are grainy.3) Battery Life.  Actually, every digital camera on the face of the earth drains batteries  almost instantly - so this really is just a disadvantage among ALL digital  cameras. That's why I'm glad this thing came with an AC Adapter. Just be  sure to use the AC Adapter whenever you can (especially when you are first  playing with it and fooling around with the LCD - that thing REALLY drains  batteries!).4) I wish this thing came with a USB cable. It has a USB OUT  on the camera, but it's a tiny little connector and I have no idea what  type USB cable to buy for it. Yeah, it comes with a serial cable, but that  is SLOW. USB has GOT to be faster.5) As everyone else has said, NO  documentation whatsoever. Just get on the Polaroid website and pull off the  product manual - that. Strangely enough, the product manual doesn't come  with the camera!All in all, a GREAT camera.

I have to admit that I bought it on a whim and the price was right. It's no secret that this is entry level, low priced digital camera so I'll try to present both the pros and cons with that in mind.PROS *Feels really nice in the hands. *Perfect size for me *Great LCD... crisp *Very easy to use *location of buttons, controls, CF slot all well thought outCONS *Picture quality is almost always terrible *If there's an eyeball in the picture... it's red *BATTERY LIFE - don't plan on getting more than 20 or so shots from a high quality set of alkalines using LCD. 25-30 without. *Upload speed very slow. My 700 DID NOT come with USB. The USB  whole was plugged. I understand that the new units come with USB so it may not be an issue... but geez... very slow to upload. If you don't have a USB 700 make sure you use an external CF card reader that utilizes USB. *The camera doesn't seem to remember the settings you provide very well. It likes to change from XGA to VGA etc.. *The battery charge indicator is very inconsistent. One or two shots into new batterys and the indicator shows a dead battery... then it bounces up and down.... usually you don't really have any idea when your batterys have drained until the camera just rolls over and dies.I took tons of pictures with this camera and every time I look at them I cringe thinking of all the memories that were captured with such poor image quality. Please consider spending a little bit more money if you are a sucker for family pictures and such. When it comes right down to it... picture quality is everything and this camera just doesn't hit the mark. I don't really regret having the camera because of the low price and the fun I had screwing around with it.... but I really get bummed looking at the crummy picture quality now. Also, for all the money that you'll spend on duracells and energizers you could buy a much better camera. By the way... you have to use good alkalines.. you can't cheat and use NIMH recharables with this camera.. it only uses about 50% of the batteries before the camera dies.

You get 4 batteries,  AC adaptor, Serial Cable, USB cable(it does have USB), wrist strap and software.. most other cameras in this range you have to buy these things seperate.  Out of the box it is ready to use..It has 4MB built in memory not much.. maybe 40 pics at its default setting which is very good for 4x6 and 5x7.  I usually download pics to my old pentium 100 laptop via serial right away when its full. But I just got a 32mb Compact flash card(price) which upped it to 300 pics!  The lower settings from 600 to more than 1000 640x480 pics!  Other stuff... It has a timer and is tripod mountable.. most other cams dont have that..  Can record live action onto VHS recorder via TV cable.The BAD: Im really irritated with the waitng time between pics which didnt occur with the PDC-640..  you wait a full 10 seconds between clicks to take another pic, even if you delete the picture right away.  Not good at live events you want to take alot of pics consecutively..  when viewing pics on tv.. it takes 3 secs. for the picture taken to appear bec it refreshes slowly.", "Date": "December 1, 2001"}, {"Title": "Camera=Good", "Author": "Kelly", "ReviewID": "R2OR17IE8TAKM9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera, although not on amazon.

Everything works great with the camera, lots of options and once again, great looking photos. I have not yet tried to download the photos and play with them in the software provided, so I didn't give it 5 stars. But I am sure it will work great, along with everything that came with the camera. It is also smaller than I thougth it would be. Very compact but heavy enough to feel strudy. I would recomend buying the new NiCd batteries from kodak with a charger. They have it available on amazon for $40, the cheapest I've seen.  Altogether it's a great camera for a great price.
