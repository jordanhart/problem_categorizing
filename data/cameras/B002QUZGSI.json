I'd rather use the extra money for lenses.  The K-x had gotten good reviews and was still twice the megapixels of my present camera.  I love how light weight it is!  When using high ISO (3200 & 6400) the noise is not bad, still there, but not too bad.  It cleans up nicely w/ noise reduction software.  The size of it works well for me and how I hold the camera, whether horizontal or vertical.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great used camera", "Author": "Hawaii guy", "ReviewID": "R2S1PN50HE0Y6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Used this camera for the first time yesterday...

Wong", "ReviewID": "R16XSSRU0BOXO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was an imaging professional during my working career own mostly Nikon systems at home and Canons in the office.  Two years ago, I needed to decide on a new DSLR for my own personal (travel and daily) use.  After much researches, I settled on this Pentax which gave me the features and price point I wanted.  This was a very basic (entry level) DSLR, but for traveling and casual photography, it produced outstanding imageries that made me happy.  I also carried a very compact (tiny in size) Sony point and shoot of 12MP, and the quality of the images were nowhere near this Pentax.  Pentax does not make this model any more, and the newer ones do not replicate the quality of this camera at that price point.  The newer Pentax's are much higher in prices, and is not competing well with the entry level Nikons and Canons.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Film makers camera", "Author": "Jp", "ReviewID": "R28NTEQLT4PALG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a camera that you can use for filmmaking. then buy this one!I was in the same rut as you (if you are looking to make movies), and I did my research and this camera is amazing at taking videoand the fact that you can change lenses makes it even better! the quality and wide range of lenses make a perfect buy for its pricecheck out this video I made with the camera![...]", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002QUZGSI"}}
