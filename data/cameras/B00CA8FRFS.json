{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Camera is Fantastic but some accesories are worthless", "Author": "James Corkrum", "ReviewID": "RVYELT6T2AVO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera and the telephoto lens are amazing, to say the least. I love this camera for its features and its compactness...much easier and lighter to use than my Nikon. I used it to photograph a Giants baseball game, a 49er game, and the America's Cup. Very, very pleased with all the images. The camera and additional lens are 5 stars!I loved getting the additional battery and the 64GM memory card. The two UV filters are just fine. The battery charger is a bit dubious. It works, but the two plastic pieces that stick up to hold the battery in place broke off in no time at all. A very stupid design. As for the other accessories, they seem to be OK but I have not really used them yet.The worst part of this kit is the case. It is way too small to be of much use. It will hold the camera, but not the telephoto lens. It will also hold a few accessories, but not many. I will have to buy a new case that I can use. No one put any thought into including this item. I would send it back, but it is part of a kit, so no way to do that. May give it to Goodwill.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "great features, great size", "Author": "Peter E.

This is a great alternative and has easy to use controls.  I like it much better than the Olympus I bought two years ago which I need the manual to use most of the time", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good set", "Author": "Santiago Gutierrez", "ReviewID": "RP47LXOO7GJ1V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera wokrs just fine, I love the size, I can travel with the unit and two lenses in less space tan with my old camera Nikon D3100, It does the job and the quallity of the assembly is great, the pictures just fine. I have problems with the macro function but I am exploring it. The extra macro and wide view lenses didnt work well because I can see the borders on the picture and didnt have full compatibility with the original lenses I have to use the adapters (included) , the rest of the equipment Works well", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Customer service and a beautiful camera... nothing to lose!", "Author": "A.
