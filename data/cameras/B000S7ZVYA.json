PROS: As for as looks it's eye appealing (important for most girls) and very tiny- pocket friendly. Has a wonderful panaramic feature I use often. Great for close up detail pictures. CONS: Indoor pictures usually always come out with orbs (I read it has to do with flash being too close to lens). Night outdoors pictures are grany and the colors come out a bit muted. My biggest problem is that I can't just take out my camera and shoot a picture. I constantly have to check and re-program my camera so that the mode I left it on is still the mode on the camera before I click. The reason is that the wheel on the top of my camera is very sensitive and the modes keep changing with out me wanting them to, just by puting it in it's case or in my purse. Low price but you get what you pay for...not much. I loved the last Canon I had so, I'm looking into buying a Canon next.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Needs bigger lens", "Author": "Customer#29845", "ReviewID": "RT8FIGBMEYQDT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a Kodak C330 that had died. I wear out these cameras in a year or two, then buy a new one for $100 to $150 when they go. I expect some technical advances each time but feel the comparison is fair.This camera adds a big viewing screen and fast zooming when looking at stored pictures. An on-off button lets you keep it in the mode you use most, and avoids having it turn itself on when it is jostled in your pack or pocket. The slightly recessed power button is easy to use (without gloves, anyway.I take photos to document conditions for scientific experiments, so true color is critical as is close-up focusing. The Kodak image sensor has always served me very well for the former need, so I'm sticking with this brand. This camera does a good job with macro, and getting into the mode is easy. You can leave the dial on the top in that mode so it is selected when you turn the camera on.It has no regular viewfinder, so you are out of luck taking pictures outdoors in the sun.The main problem is that the lens does not gather enough light. The C330 had a bigger lens, so the pictures had more detail and depth of field. Even though the C330 has a 4MP sensor and the M753 has a 7MP sensor, pictures taken with the C330 are much better. The extra megapixels just give better resolved grains, not a better resolved image.I expect to replace this camera with one in the C series when it wears out.", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Kodak M753 camera is really bad one", "Author": "SKK", "ReviewID": "R1IFNSR6DACJIY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Believe me ... the pictures produced by this camera are all much worse than 4 mp one.

They have both been dropped onto hard surafces and they still work like brand new.  The picture quality is also top notch.  I carry mine everywhere I go which came in handy the other day when we were hit by a person who ran a red light. The pictures I took after the accident helped to show the insurance company how bad the damage is.  For the best quality photos, this camera is the one, just make sure to set it to the highest mega-pixel setting(just like with any other camera, the higher the better).

It's a great camera with bright colors, almost no lag between taking pictures, and I love the fact that it runs on a rechargeable battery instead of AAs. There are a few flaws: a very slow delete time (about 4 seconds); every once in a while, a single picture gets corrupted and when reviewing pictures, I get the error message \"invalid format.\" There are a few other things that I can't remember, but nothing major.

Unfortunately I say loved because someone knocked my purse down and it landed directly on a hard floor where my camera was. Up until that, it had withstood the occasional drop from a normal standing distance. It takes amazing pictures for point and click. For those complaining about the quality, its not a pro camera. Its made for simple and quick snaps! Absolutely loved it, I'm looking to buy it again because I'm unhappy with my newer kodak digital camera I purchased. I never had any problems with the focusing (unless I was moving excessively of course) or the display. Speaking of the display, my newer cameras display is grainy and doesn't show what the picture will actually look like while this camera does! I would really recommend it to anyone who just likes to take pictures! The potential to edit the photos on third party software is unaffected by it just being 7 mp. The pictures come out very smooth and beautiful.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good 10% of the time, very bad 90% of the time", "Author": "150 F3", "ReviewID": "R2I7NBDLOUO2XS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love this camera. It has given me many great treasures of beautiful photography.The M753 is meant for sunny days. I love how clear and colorful my ISO 80 photos turn out. I use EV -0.3 and low color, then make minor adjustments later to saturate, reduce noise, and correct levels. It's a wonderful camera when you know its strengths.Thanks to another reviewer, I tried Fireworks scene mode for night photography. My photos were clear, colorful, and pleasing. The camera focused on street light lens flare in night landscape mode, so more than half my shots were badly out of focus. Fireworks mode (with a tripod and the 2 second delay) was the answer.Panoramas require a tripod and careful alignment. When you do them handheld, the 10 second delay between shots and the long delay after pressing the shutter button lead to obvious seams and totally unaligned photos. I like how the tripod mount is directly below the lens so I can rotate the camera on the screw for the best alignment.Black and whites in overcast daylight are lovely. The silvery world of soft shadows and reflecting puddles is very beautiful. It helps to let more light in in overcast conditions. EV +0.3 does the trick. EV +0.7 is wonderful for objects silhouetted against white skies. Black and white does not work well in sunlight, so I just shoot in low color at EV -0.3 and convert later.I use 3 megapixel mode to reduce noise. I've used an M753 for 2 years and am delighted with how well it performs. My affection for the camera has steadily grown over time. Never had a problem with purple fringing.Once or twice a month the lens fails to retract when powered down. I just cycle power and it corrects itself. I'm pleased with lens reliability. The recessed power switch button is thoughtfully designed and very reliable.I don't like the self timer feature. It has to be selected every time, so I have to bring up the menu and deal with the interface dozens of times when I just want to make a series of clear macros with the tripod. Kodak should just leave the self timer on like Canon and go back to normal shooting mode when the camera is turned off and on again.Picture quality is compromised and generally unspectacular, but the small size and light weight more than make up for it. I think photography is more rewarding when you learn equipment weaknesses and overcome them. I think of the M753 as a very, very good toy camera. It's capable of dazzling photographic brilliance in the right light. I learned a lot about photography by seeing good and bad M753 results and understanding how I could improve my success rate. It's fun to playfully experiment with extreme settings and intentionally get wrong looking photos. Doing it wrong helps you learn how to get it right when it counts.I can't recommend this model for everyone. It won't appeal to perfectionists. It's really noisy in low light and high ISOs, but the answer to those problems is using a tripod, adding light, and using black and white to at least eliminate chroma noise.The video mode is terrible. Blocky and unpleasant. Harsh light cannot be exposed properly. Audio has a constant high pitched whine that's impossible to digitally filter out later. Pathetic!But if you like walking around, taking clear still pictures of colorful things in sunshine, and know about basic camera adjustments (white balance, ISO, saturation, and exposure compensation), the M753 is a fun camera for casual use. It's pretty amazing to draw out full, vibrant color from my low color photos. Its pictures are very lovely on the web.Try using the lens at midrange. 64mm is very clear and impressive, with lovely foreground clarity and smooth bokeh of distant scenery. Full wide angle and full telephoto are good, but the middle focal lengths are very good.I feel no regrets about choosing this camera. The only things I'd change would be a Canon style self timer interface and less pixel density. 3 or 4 megapixels would be ideal. With 7, you're just recording random noise and superfluous detail.So, a mixed review, but those 3 stars are respectfully given. I really got more than my money's worth out of this handy camera. It enhanced my life and offered many wonderful experiences of enjoyment and creativity.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "excellent merchandise and delivery", "Author": "ash", "ReviewID": "R3CRJ7ZEMD5FLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the well packed item arrived well in time and has got our extreme satisfaction, very good quality-price ratio.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak EasyShare m753", "Author": "J.
