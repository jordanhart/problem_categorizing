The bag is way to small to fit all of these items that you get it only fits two lenses and the camera itself. the side pockets fits the memory cards and batteries, or the cords you get this them a hdmi cord and a rca cord which you can watch on your computer or t.v.... so once again the camera and the 4 lenses are amazing but other accessories are cheap but good for the time being. i took pictures with it and it came out so beautiful, life like.. you must get this camera i gave 4 stars just cause im raiting the whole package (cheap accessories) not just the camera.. ill give the camera 10 stars.. thats how good it is.. oh and the outer of the camera is so tough like rubberdize such an amazing camera..update: they came out with the T4i dont get it, theres a recall on it....", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "best camera ever", "Author": "C.
