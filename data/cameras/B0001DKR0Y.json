I compared a few and this was the best value I found. The pictures come out clear in all modes and the flash is acceptable. It is a bit slow, but so are all of these small cameras. I've used a Ricoh and a Nikon in the type and price range before and this is the best out of the three. The movie setting is unimportant to me, but the quality of the videos is very poor. If you want to take movies, buy a movie camera. This unit is very easy to use, simple on screen settings, easy fast download via the included USB cable. I do suggest getting rechargeable batteries, but I suggest that for all of these types of cameras. All in all, the camera is small and light, easy to carry, easy to use and takes great photos for the format of camera that it is. If you want to do fine photography you must buy top of the line equipment as none of these little cameras will take those kinds of pictures.

The D-395 was my third and most disappointing, but it won't by my last Olympus because I made a consumer error when I purchased this camera....ASSUMPTIONS! I was looking for a replacement for my older Olympus D-380 because I had proudly given it to my significant. A good performer and reliable the D-380 was. I assumed that the newer D-395 would be at least as fast as my older D-380 when actually taking the desired photo after the shutter release was pressed. Wrong! Be prepared to limit your candid shots because you'll `miss the moment'. Stills and portraits are fine though. I assumed that it would have as fast a flash recharge time as fast as my older D-380. Wrong! This is another `miss the moment' issue. I assumed that it would be able to take as many and as fast of pictures in the continuous drive mode as my old D-380. Wrong! I assumed that it would charge up as fast when I first turn it on. Wrong! Yup, more of the same. I assumed that the display would be as clear. Wrong! I assumed that the flash would work as well in low light conditions. Wrong!  As I mentioned before I made several assumptions when it came to these details. I am very pleased with my other Olympus products. So, be sure you know what you are buying and don't assume that just because you are purchasing the same brand AND upgrading in model number that you are upgrading the camera!

Easy to transfer photos to computer or printer. Good color on default settings. Decent features (have not yet explored all of them!).  Small, fits in purse or pocket. Uses AA batteries. Not so good, but fixable points: Small XD card supplied with camera; bought a 128 replacement. Like all digitals, eats batteries; bought rechargeables.  Bad points: No optical zoom. I find the digital zoom to be useless. Shutter button confusing for some, it has different options for simple push or firm hold push - if you hand this camera to a friend to take your picture, they usually won't get the shutter to work on the first try. Have not had much luck with the red-eye reducer, but I use software in my PC to fix it. Other: Description claims photos up to 17\"; I like to print at 300dpi - I have gotten 8x10 OK but I get the best clarity up to 5x7. I would think average users want 4x6 prints, and this camera delivers.

Don't let the 3mp limit fool you, it takes very clear and sharp photos for only 3mp's. Plain and simple the photo quality is great, great colors and all.The video I shot on this camera was great, it was a tad bit pixel'y, but still very clear a resolute for a 3mp camera. Again, I recommend this camera for it standard video quality.One thing I did'nt like, however, was the Compact Flash Card slot, an SD slot would have made things simpler, not big deal tho.Another thing I wasn't fond of was the flash time on this camera. It takes about 3-4 seconds to capture the image, and then another 2 seconds to process the image. Quick snap shots are simply impossible with this camera.The AA battery slot was no big deal, I bought rechargeable ones and they worked fine.In short, this camera was good for its time- 2004, and tho some of its features are outdated, its still good as a cheap camera you'd use sparingly.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Starter Camera", "Author": "C.

This means if you want pictures at a lower quality, you have to set this every time you start up the camera.- the battery life is poor.  Standard AA's don't last long at all (we did not try NiMH or other rechargeables).- the response time from depressing the shutter to taking a picture is longer than any other digital camera I've tried.- the on-screen menuing is very confusing and not intuitive.

They were all entry level cam's from the era, a couple of Fuji's, Kodak's and a Pentax. The Pentax i think might have even been around $400-500 in it's day, so above entry level...but for me the D-395 beat that out, as well.I'm not going into technicals, i don't have the knowledge for that. But put simply, the picture quality for both indoor and outdoor settings is very good...imho. In fact i just did a test of an indoor shot against a current entry level camera, the 12mp Lumix DMC-S1, which sells for around $90 as we speak...and i can honestly tell you the D-395 image quality was MILES ahead. It wasn't even a close contest, the S1 was super grainy in comparison, whereas the D-395 was crisp and clear in low/moderate lighting.As far as the negatives go, the menu won't allow you to save the image setting at the highest quality once you switch it off, which is a bit of an annoyance. It's also a bit of a slow poke between shots, and of course video is very limited and poor by today's standard.Overall though, just for still photos it's a fun and easy to use camera to have a muck around with, and i'm sure you can find it at a giveaway price. And as mentioned, as far as pure image quality goes, i'm sure it will still out shine many of today's entry level digital camera's.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to use.", "Author": "Roger K", "ReviewID": "R9FH6AYV8TBW0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera!

My sister recieved it as a Christmas gift and didn't use it on a regular basis, so I borrowed it when my main 35mm was damaged.I got better pictures from the cheapest single-function 35mm I own. The D395 has a few manual controls, but nothing spectacular in the least. There's no way to adjust the shutter speed, aperature, ISO, flash strength, nothing.To get to the macro mode, you have to go into the menu and switch it to macro, as opposed to most cameras having a button that switches macro on and off with one touch. That was a huge pain in the rear. The macro mode itself is pathetic. The only way to get a clear macro shot without a tripod and the work of moving the camera in the exact range, is to use the flash, which then produces glare on many objects that close.In average lighting conditions, the WB, while on auto, kept shifting back and forth between modes. So, one picture would have a yellow tone to it, another would have a grey tone to it. The only time I ever got decent tones was if I used the flash. Which I guess is alright for most, but those who dislike using flash will have a hard time with this camera.Any dark object in any photo taken without flash looked extremely grainy, had an RGB pixellated look to it, and everything surrounding it looked dim because it threw off the auto WB.My sister doesn't seem to mind the quality of the photos she takes with the camera, because she doesn't know anything about photography and keeps it on auto mode with the flash on. So, this camera would be okay for those like her, but I've compared her photos with similar photos from my camera in terms of quality of tone and clarity and everything, and the camera is still sub-par. I guess if you don't pay a lot of attention to how clear a picture is or anything, this camera might work for you.

After doing some research, I chose the D-395 as a X-mas gift for 2004.Unlike Kodak that just got in the camera buisness because fewer consumers were using 35mm cameras, Olympus is a brand that has a lot of experinec with digital cameras. So the brand is well trusted. The pictures the D-395 takes are very good for a 3 Megapixel. When hooked up to a desktop, the camera works as an external memory drive. You can copy and paste pictures with a few clicks of the mouse. The software that comes with the camera is nothing compaired to Adobe Photoshop but will do for a beginerThe controls are easy to use and once you set the camera up the way you like it, you can just point and shoot. The settings will not change even after you have pulled the batteries out and stored it for a few weeks.About the batteries, yes I do agree with the other reviewers, the D-395 will drain the required 2 AA batteries in a few hours but this is not any diffrent that any of the HP's and Kodac's my friends have. So add some recargables to your cart while you are here.Bottom line, the Olympus D-395 is a camera for beginers but in order to get the most of it, or any other digital camera. One must be a bit savy with technology or willing to take the time to learn. If you are looking for a cheap digital camera that will take great pictures with you not having to learn how to use it, then you best just stick with the 35mm.", "Date": "May 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not a bad camera", "Author": "T.
