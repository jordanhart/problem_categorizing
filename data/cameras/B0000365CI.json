I purchased a digital camera in 1997 and was not entirely impressed by what 500$ got me then.  However, 3 years later, I stumbled upon the Nikon  Coolpix 800 at a great price and took another shot at digital  imaging.PICTURES: The pictures it takes are fantastic!  The 1600x1200  resolution really makes a difference when making prints.  They look like  they were taken with a 35mm.  This is not even mentioning the backing of a  quality Nikkor lens that picks up lots of detail other digicams of the same  resolution do not.  Another feature that impressed me was the fact I could  add additional lenses to it (and Nikon has 3 designed specifically for the  Coolpix 800/950/990).FEATURES: It has a lot of features of its bigger  brother like an uncompressed TIFF format, ability to take B&W pictures,  and adjustable metering.  However, for a non-professional photographer, I  liked the fact the auto mode was easy to use and allowed me to take great  pictures right away.  I now can switch to manual mode to take more control  of the picture, but the camera is ready to take great pictures right out of  the box.  Unlike other reviewers, mine came with a paper manual in addition  to a CD-ROM that explained many of the basic features and taught me about  some of the more exotic ones.This is a great camera for anyone wanting a  digital camera that takes great pictures but doesn't want to spend ton of  money on features that may not even be used.  Otherwise, the CP990 and the  D1 are really nice cameras for those interested in more control.  I do  recommend getting an extra Flash card since 8 MB does run out fairly  quickly when taking pictures in FINE or NORMAL mode.  Getting a USB SanDisk  CompactFlash reader was also a big help since the built-in connection is  serial and can take a LONG time to download pictures if you have a lot of  them.", "Date": "April 15, 2000"}, {"Title": "Highly recommended", "Author": "John Tubbs", "ReviewID": "R9Z5VBYMOF7TF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading just about every review I could find, I finally purchased the Coolpix 800.  I was looking for a camera that was above 2 mega pixels and $500 or below.  I have read some of the reviews about the low quality of pictures in a dark room, but after playing with the light meter adjustment I did not have any problems with the quality of brightness of the photo.  I even went to the extreme and took some close up photos, outside, in total darkness of a Hybiscus bush.  The photo showed incredible detail and deep rich color from the flowers. I also read some of the complaints about the auto focus always being on and drawing on battery power.  This is only the case if you leave it on this setting.  You can set it to only auto focus when you press the shutter half way.The pros for this camera are: It's easy to figure out.  Takes great pictures. Has lots of features for manual and automatic photos.  You can even take black and white photos. Different lens settings like fisheye and wide angle. Manual and Auto settings.  LCD screen is incredible.  It does have a lens cover. and it is fairly compact.  It's a lot of fun shooting pictures just to see what kind of results you get with the manual settings.  I was able to have fun with this camera right out of the box.  My only complaints are that I wish it came with a power supply, the battery cover is a little flimsy, and the software that comes with the camera isn't anything to get all excited over.  Bottom line is if I had to buy it again I would do it gladly and without hesitation.Hope this makes your descision a little easier.", "Date": "December 4, 2000"}, {"Title": "Best bang for the buck", "Author": "Breinpar@yahoo.com", "ReviewID": "R4DPRU5FBGR5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Coolpix 800 for about a month now, and I can still say that I'm one proud Papa. Yeah, they eat batteries like candy, but so do most cameras with any kahonna's. Buy rechargable! The biggest drawback to this  camera is the serial port issue. There's a way around that, though. Buy a  SanDisk (they manufacture Nikon memory cards) drive and USB...uploadin'  quicker than spit. Well, now that we've bought a CompactFlash drive, some  Nickle Metal-Hydride rechargable batteries, an AC adapter, and another 48mb  of memory(or you'll be reminded of that time when you ran out of film),  we've just added about $250 to an already pricey camera. Not to fear folks.  If your reading this review, that means you have internet access. Shop  around for the best price. On-line prices will, without a doubt, beat the  human factor. Try,  Buy .com  for the camera and Spotshop.com  for the  other goodies. I saved a couple hundred easily. Oh and lastly, I wouldn't  have a digital camera without at least 2 megapixels, built in flash,  optical and LCD viewfinder, and CompactFlash(most common).

There are a few minor issues that I wish I had known when I was shopping for digital cameras.  I would like to have a little more zoom capability than the 2x lens provides, as well as better macro capability (or any macro at all).  I understand  that the Coolpix 950 has both.  A flashcard disk drive is a neccessity as  battery life is very short (4 AABatteries last maybe an hour). For example,  taking and uploading 14 photos will zap 4 brand new Duracell Ultras.  I did  purchase 4 Nickel Metal rechargeable AA's and that helps ease the pain of  replacing batteries.  It would be nice if they included the AC  adapter, no question this is a must for this camera.  Uploading pictures  from the camera to PC is easy but slow with the provided software.  An  additional photo editor other that the one provided will be neccessary to  do any creative editing.On the bright side, the camera has an  outstanding compact flash and is loaded with nice features that I have not  taken the time to figure out.Overall, I am quite satisfied with this  camera as the quality of photos can help me overlook some of it's  shortcomings.

But the reason because I am writting, this new review is to give some advices to those with the same camera: 1- Buy a battery recharger ( a 2 Hours one is great) 2- Buy 8 rechargables AA Niquel-Metal hydraide (choose a good ones, the cheaper don't last) 3- Buy a USB compact flash card reader ( The best investment! ) 4- Buy a 64 Mb compact Flash Card ( It is in most of the cases enough for a short trip) 5- Think before taking a picture, and use the features of the camera, it is so versatile that will allows you to have that great picture,  whatever the conditions, but need some practics. 6 With good illumination use the automatic setting (A)it always get the better picture. 7- With Poor condition use always Manual. set for 200 ASA or 400 ASA depending on the condition, you can even increase the apperture of the objetive manually, do so if you think is needed 8- Finally you need a good software to retouch the pictures they always need to increase the brightness, and sometimes also the gamma. I am using  CamediaMaster from Olympus and I am very happy, it is not the best for retouching, but it the best to managing  and organizing your pictures, besides you can play a slide show without need of create any album, just play the file.  Enjoy your Coolpix and play with it for as while before judging it. ...", "Date": "September 25, 2000"}, {"Title": "Superb Images", "Author": "Larry Vevig", "ReviewID": "R3D0QI1V9XXRDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The images that this camera is capable of producing will be hard to duplicate in any other digital camera that can be purchased for under $600.  Previous reviews have mentioned size, controls, and rudimentary software  as problems.  I don't believe Nikon or anyone else bills this camera as  a 'pocket' camera.  If size is a big criteria, consider the Canon S10. The  CP800 is easy to hold and is not so small that it is hard for someone with  larger hands to manipulate.I find the controls about average for a  digital camera.  Digital cameras don't work like film cameras and require  that you develope new skills.  No matter what camera you purchase there  will always be a learning curve involved.  Most of the controls seem quite  logical and once you are used to them, cease to be a problem.The Nikon  View software is simply a means of getting the images from the camera to  the computer.  From there you can use the image editing program of your  choice to modify or print your pictures.  One of the great things about a  digital camera is the fact that you CAN adjust and retouch your photos.  Many cameras download their pictures via a serial cable and they are all  slow.  USB card readers are inexpensive (around $50) and GREATLY speed up  the process.One big plus is the availability of additional lenses and  filters, another feature not generally found in cameras of this price  range.No one camera is a good 'fit' for every user but if what you are  looking for is great film-quality images, you won't be dissapointed with  the CP800.", "Date": "January 6, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great camera, minor annoyances", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RCEJ2X48HEXMJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my CoolPix 800 since November and for the most part, I am very pleased with it.  The pictures are great and there are a fair amount of features that the advanced amateur will find useful.  Two major  disappointments however are the inability to control the shutter speed and  aperature, and the battery life.  Nikon's web site will lead you to believe  that you can control the shutter speed and aperature (such as when you are  taking fast action shots or photos at night), but this is not true.  Shutter speed and aperature are automatically controlled no matter what you  are shooting.  To get that kind of control, you need to be purchasing the  CoolPix 950.  Amazon's review that \"battery life is a winner\" is  a crock.  The camera eats battries at an alarming rate even with the LCD  screen switched off.  I have considered purchasing a rechargeable set, but  my solution is to buy the battries in bulk at Costco.  You can get a brick  of 48 AA Kirkland battries for about $12.  These battries are almost as  highly rated (according to Consumer Reports) as regular Duracell's and a  whole lot less expensive.  Unfortunately, not using rechargeables is not  the most environmentally friendly option.  By the way, the owners manual on  CD.

I have had my Nikon 800 for 6 weeks now and doubt I will ever use film again.  The photo quality is fantastic.  Using the normal setting, about 500kb/photo(the high res is about twice the size), the 4x6 prints are indistinguishable from 35mm and are comparable at 8x10.  The ability to image both the light and dark portions (ie the shaddowed areas in a bright sunshine shot) of a photo are far superior to film.  My prints on an HP 862 printer using \"best print quality\" and Kodak glossy premium picture paper are photo shop quality.It is very easy to use. I have spent less than 5 minutes with the manual.  I have shot almost everything on auto exposure with great results. I have had no problem with exposures too dark.Three small negatives (pun intended),  the cycle time between exposures can exceed 2 seconds, the flash is weak, and the Pictureworks/HotShots software included is cumbersome.  The exposure speed, iso 100 equivilent, can be frustrating in low light situations, but this is common to all digital cameras.  You do need to buy a 36 or 64mb... flash card to hold 60 to 120 photos until you can download to yourcomputer.  The 8mb that comes with this (and most other) camera only holds 8 to 16 images.  A SanDisk USB flash card reader...  will quicken the transfer to your computer and save batteries.", "Date": "December 9, 2000"}, {"Title": "Fantastic quality for hundreds less than the 3 megpix models", "Author": "Christopher Campbell \"campbellcj\"", "ReviewID": "R721PGF2EYF7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I came very close to purchasing the CoolPix 990 or Olympus C3030Z for twice the price of the CP800, but after a few days with this little gem I am very pleased with my choice. The extra money is well spent on accessory  lenses, rechargable NiMH batteries, memory cards and reader. The 2X  optical zoom is not a big issue if you add on a telephoto lens -- the  current Nikons all support add on lenses with their threaded barrel, using  the properly sized adapter rings.  Keep in mind that the digital zoom on  the 800, and most digital cameras, results in severe noise and distortion.  I doubt I'll ever use the digital zoom.Image quality is superb, and I  have found myself marvelling at the sharpness of pics shot at full res  (1600x1200) in fine mode, even at fully automatic settings.  Color and  white balance seem very natural, and of course are user-settable in manual  mode. Nikon's expertise in quality optics and metering is very evident  here.Minor concerns are that the battery cover area seems flimsy, and  also the optical viewfinder must be used with the right-eye to avoid severe  nose-smudging of the large LCD, which is flush with the rear case and dead  center so right in nose territory!User interface is quite friendly and  easily mastered with a bit of experimentation on the menus.You WILL want  a USB or PC-card CompactFlash reader as the camera does not include USB  support natively. Serial port transfers are a joke with files this big  (600-900K per pic)!I highly recommend this camera to intermediate  photographers who want more resolution, manual control, and lens options  than a low-end device, but do not need all the bells and whistles of the  $800+ 3-megapixel \"big guns\".", "Date": "June 1, 2000"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for an excellent price", "Author": "Richard Maher", "ReviewID": "R2LDZP39RLSRN7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If your thinking about buying a digital camera for this price definitely buy this Nikon 800. The 2.1 megpixels far outshine any 1.3 mega pixels cameras. The LCD monitor is like a tv. The battery life is also excellent I  get about 1.5 hours on my rechargeables. Its completely worth the extra few  bucks, why settle for less, as they say.I love this camera ive played  with some similarly priced ones(EG Canon powershot s100) but i still love  the Nikon 800. But so as to help you I'll tell you some points to note  about the camera that some people may not like.1. Rechargeable batteries  are a must,eventhough the battery life is one of the longest around its  pretty much a necessity for any digital camera. Batteries + recharger cost  me 17 dollars.2. The zooming capabilities on digital cameras are not  very good. However for the Nikon you can buy a telefoto lens. 3. The  memory card supplied with digital cameras is always the most basic. The  Nikon comes with an 8MB card which with the settings(picture quality,  picture size) that I have selected gets me about 50 pics. However at the  best pic qualtiy and largest photo size, this card can only store one  photo. However my photos show no adverse degradation in quality or size, so  I do not feel the need to buy more memory.4. There are loads of manual  functions that you may never use, or use only sometimes. But it means that  everybody is happy.  5. It's takes alot of practice(a few days) to  capture moving objects and ensure to get the object at the precise moment  you want it.  6. It comes with a soft, flimsy case , you want to buy  more protection. 7. Downloading photos using the serial port is ok for  an 8MB card. Anything higher than 16MB may become annoying. Certainly if  your impatient get the usb card reader...I would  be willing to pay a 100 bucks more for this camera its seriously that good.  The pictures produced are just of such good quality.Suffice to say Im very  happy with my purchase.", "Date": "August 18, 2000"}, {"Title": "A Pretty Good Camera For Your Money", "Author": "Christopher Sheppard", "ReviewID": "RF8S5VSKCK7B2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera having never used digital, and I must say I was stunned! It is VERY easily used, and even if you're not electronically inclined, you'll figure it out in about 15 with the help of the QuickStart  guide that comes with it. I will say that for a more advanced  user/experienced photographer, it may seem a little elementary; you can't  change shutter speed (this is automatic), F-stop has very limited  variability, zoom is so-so (though there are a variety of accessory lenses  you can purchase).As for batteries, do yourself a favor and buy some  NiMH rechargeable batteries (takes 4 AA) at radio shack, where a set of  four plus the charger is only 19.99. This Camera is a ravenous,  battery-devouring beast, and you will have to change batteries after 45  mins if you use alkaline. With the NiMH, I have yet to kill them- they last  forever.The auto mode is very user friendly, and does just about  everything for you. The manual mose allows you to change around things a  bit (but does limit you, for example the shutter I mentioned)There are  several different resolutions you can use (the default is 1600x1200, but  you can shoot 640x480 or smaller), and also several shooting options like  16-shot which takes 16 shots over the course of about 5-8 secs, bestshot  which will take 10 and the camera decides which is the best. Or you can  take up to 40 frames per second.You might want to get an extra or larger  memory card because even though they say it holds 200 pictures, this is a  bit stretched. It will hold about 30 basic quality, 16 normal quality, 8  fine quality or 1 high quality in the 1600x1200 mode, and about 200, 100,  50, 5 in the 640x480 mode. Though I WILL say that the 640x480 VGA mode is a  good mode because even a 19\" monitor cannot display a 1600x1200 shot,  and part of it will always be off screen, whereas the 640x480 almost  perfectly fits the screen (I use the 640x480 VGA mode myself). Plus the  1600x1200 shoty takes quite a qhile to upload.Summing it up, if you have  never used a digital before, you will be surprised off you A-- at how easy  it is to use and take good photos. If you are a professional or have  experience, you might want to go with the 900, 950, or 990.I give it 4.5  stars", "Date": "June 28, 2000"}, {"Title": "Best deal out there", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3PX2CNMIN8M19", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 3rd digital camera I've purchased.  My first model was a 640x480, which looked good in emails, but was really lacking when I tried to print my pictures out.  Next came a megapixel model, which was better,  because it made prints look good, but I couldn't zoom or crop much before  my pictures started looking fuzzy.  It was time for a 2 megapixel model.  I  looked at the Coolpix 950, but it was too big and too expensive.  I looked  at the Canon digital elph too.  It's small and cute, but in my opinion  isn't worth the extra money. I looked at a few other models too,  but I kept coming back to the Nikon.  I think that most people agree that  Nikon optics are about the best available, and they have a good track  record with previous models of film and digital cameras...Good stuff: GREAT pictures; Nikon lens; optical (not digital)  zoom (though not quite as powerful as some); Compact Flash (personal  preference, maybe, but available in bigger capacities); Much more compact  than the 950, with most of the features and the same resolution.Not as  good: have almost lost the lens cap several times already; batteries don't  last too long with lcd on; get rechargeables! Unless you're a hardcore  photographer, this should have all of the manual abilities and photo  quality you need.  If you are a hardcore photographer, you probably want  one of the 3 megapixel models instead...For me, the Coolpix 800 is 80%  of a new Olympus 3030 or a Coolpix 990, but for less than half the price.

Be warned though that you should prepare to spend quite a  bit more than the cost of the camera. 2 sets of batteries and a recharger  are a neccessity and maybe an AC adapter as well. Nikon should try to  include a recharger, nothing kills the digital camera experience more than  realizing that your camera lasts for about 30 minutes before you need to  put in new batteries. Also the 8 MB card is useless. You can only take 1  (!) high quality uncompressed image. Factor in...for a 64 MB  Compact Flash.

I did extensive on-line research and the reviews were outstanding concerning picture quality.  In this regard the reviews were  accurate. However, I mistakenly thought that picture quality was the only  necessary feature in a digital camera.  Wrong.  I have found many  disaapointing features in this camera.  First, that the camera's manual is  on disk rather than paper is LAME!  How are you supposed to read how to  download and process pictures when your computer screen is tied up reading  the manual. Second, the camera's controls are very confusing.  Many buttons  serve dual (sometimes three) functins which of course you have to memorize  because the manual is only on disk.  (There is a printed pocket guide but  it is an abbreviated version.) By the way, I printed the entire manual and  it is still the worst written electronic manual I have ever read. More  experienced digital photographers may not mind this. Third, the camera has  a cheap feel to it.  After buying it I went to a few stores to see some  others and realized how cheap the feel of this camera was.  Fourth, the  camera is an odd shape and size making it difficult to put it in your  pocket and go.  Fifth, the serial cable provided is a slow method of  transfer.  Purchase of a card reader is a must.  Sixth,  the Nikon View  software is very basic.  Thus, a photo editing program will be necessary.  Finally, the lens cap is not tethered to the camera.  While this is not a  big deal, it is inconvienant, but more importantly highlights the many  shortcomings of the camera's design.  Again, although I have many  complaints I have to admit the picture quality is exceptional.  The  question is would I buy this camera again.  Probably not.  I would trade a  slight reduction in picture quality for a better thought out camera which  is easier to use.  By the way, I have since discovered that the place I  bought it has a 30% restocking charge precluding return of the camera.

With a quick skim the manual you will be off and running.  The layout of the camera is very logical and easy to navigate.  Most people will probably use the autofocus although a manual focus mode is avaliable for more \"advanced\" options for photo-taking.  The autofocus is terrific and allows the user to have a \"point-and-click\" attitude to digital photo imaging while encompassing the advantages of the incoming \"digital age.\"  The TFT LCD screen allows you to have a great view of pictures you have taken and stored on the compact flash card.  The LCD on-screen menu is extremely easy to operate.  It produces superb pictures rivaling many higher resolution cameras.  With a decent printer, you could produce photos detailed enough to rival that of regular 35mm \"professional\" development. The print quality is great and it is enhanced by high quality photo paper.  It is a good idea to do plenty of research on the digital camera topic before you purchase one since it is quite an investment even for the \"cheaper\" cameras.  The included 8mb compact flash card is decent, holding 16 \"normal\" detail 1600X1200 photos, although I would recomend purchasing a larger capacity one (i.e. 16mb+).  Another additional bonus would be to purchase a compact flash reader to download the images.  They are relatively cheap and reduce the download time.  Rechargeable batteries would be an added plus since the LCD display is a battery drainer.  Another important accessory would be a high-quality carring case considering the amount of money put into the camera.

Sharp pictures, excellent focusing & light weight.Here are some negative points if that's what you are looking for -1. It is a battery hogger. The 4 energizer (alkaline) battery pack that came with the camera lasted only for about 20 pictures. You NEED rechargeable NiMH battery. .... Andthe charger is [even more money]. You don't really need the optional AC adapter. It is just another thing to load the electrical outlet near the PC.2. The 8MB CompactFlash card is just not enough if you want to stick to the 1600x1200 resolution which is the default. At normal compression, you can have only 16 pictures. I feel that 640x480 resolution should have been the default. 640x480 is only available in advanced options. At 640x480, the 8MB card can hold 102 pictures at normal compression which is good enough for me. But if you want to stick to 1600x1200, you may be better off considering a card with more capacity.I decided not to reduce the number of stars because of these negative points because the quality easily makes up for them and these negative points may be unavoidable (as in the case of battery usage) or not applicable to all (as in the case of resolution & storage size).I had been using Nikon N50 (non-digital) for years and had fallen love with that camera.

They all  graduated college before I did.  They all got married before I did.  They  all had kids before I did.  And they all bought digital cameras before I  did.  Being the last digital camera purchaser had its advantages, though.  I got to learn from all of their mistakes!  I have a friend with the  Olympus 460, one with a Nikon Coolpix 950 (the fancier version of the 800),  and one with a Kodak 280.  They all bring their cameras along on hikes and  camping trips, so I was able to see all of the pros and cons to help me  make my own purchase.  I decided that I wanted 2 mega-pixels and optical  zoom.  I also didn't want to spend more than $500.  I ruled out the Olympus  right away, because it only has a 1.2 mega-pixel image size and I want at  least 2 mega-pixels so I can make 5x7s or even 8x10s.  Of course, after I  bought my Coolpix 800, I learned that Olympus is coming out with a 2  mega-pixel version of the 460, so if I were buying it today, I'd have to  reconsider. After ruling out the Olympus, I was left with the Kodak DC280  and the Coolpix.  My friend's 950 was outside of my budget, but that's OK,  because I didn't like the shape of the 950 (weird twisty thing) or its  size.  The 800 is smaller and looks and feels like a normal camera.  If you  compare the 800 to the Kodak DC280, they basically look identical.  2x  optical zoom, 3x digital zoom, Compact Flash card, AA batteries, optical  viewfinder, LCD display, etc...they're nearly identical.  In the end, I  figured \"Kodak mostly makes instamatics, and Nikon makes lots of  high-quality 35mm cameras\".  I've heard lots of great things about  Nikon film cameras, and figured that this technology would carry over to  their digital cameras.  Besides, with the rebate, the Nikon is  cheaper!I'm totally thrilled with my decision.  The pictures are  fantastic, and the camera never fails to amaze me with its flexibility.  Though it's not as fancy as the 950, it's LOTS cheaper and is easier to  carry.  Look around: if you want a 2 mega-pixel camera with an optical  zoom, you can count on spending $500 or $550.  This camera has all the  features I need with an awesome price!  Definitely happy with my purchase,  and happy with the quick painless service I received from Amazon.

Why, you ask? Well, this Coolpix is quite old (in terms of digital) and you'll be throwing your good money after a badly outdated camera. Here are the details why:Megapixels. The Coolpix 800 takes 2.1 megapixel pictures, but the 880 take 3.1 megapixel.  (More pixels are preferred to less since this will affect your image quality. ANd believe me - you will SEE the difference!)Zoom. The 800 has a 2x optical, plus 2.5 digital zoom lens; however, the 880 has a 2.5x optical and the digital zoom.  You always want as high an optical zoom because using pure digital zoom will make your pictures look fuzzy!Memory. Both the 800 and 880 come with 8 MB of CompactFlash, but most people would agree that this isn't enough.  Purchase an additional CompactFLash card for 32 MB or more and you'll be happy you did.Downloading. The 800 only connects via serial port, but the 880 connects via serial OR USB. THe USB connection is MUCH MUCH faster for downloading pics to yoru computer, but the serial (800's only method) is horrendously slow.Batteries.  THe 800 uses 4 AA batteries, but the 880 uses far superior and much longer-lasting 2CR5 lithium batteries. The 880's batteries also weigh less.Price. This is the ONLY reason you shoudl consider the 800 ($499) over the 880 ($699).  But let's face it, if you have $499 for the 800, you should fork over the extra $200 and get the 880 so you can have a digital camera that will last you more than a year.

You can't necessarily tell how the picture will come out just from looking at the LCD screen, but when the pictures were viewed on my computer, they were really nice.  The pictures were clear.  Even though the room wasn't that light, the pictures were fairly bright.  I forgot to change the focus to distance for one picture of the kids on the stage, so it didn't come out that great--oops.  Also, the close-up shots were really nice--even in darkness or low light, when the LCD screen won't show anything, the pictures come out clear and bright.  I noticed two things I thought were unusual.  The first is that the pictures seem to be better when the zoom lens is low or zoomed-out.  If I used the close zoom as opposed to simply moving closer, the picture seemed darker and less clear.  The second--the batteries did start to go low later in the evening.  So, I plugged in the A/C adapter.  I forgot to unplug it, and the batteries were fully-charged in the AM.  I don't think I was sent rechargeable batteries, but having the A/C adapter seems to extend the battery life, so, though I saw the low battery light in the evening on the first night I started taking pictures.

The optional lenses are great and will transfer to other Nikon models later if you upgrade.I prefer the form factor of the 900/950/990 even though they are bigger, because of the way the body twists.

Long \"Lisa K\"", "ReviewID": "R137KG3A9GXZAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really enjoying this camera. It is very easy to use as a point and shoot camera as well as having the manual mode for the more advanced user. I am the in between user. I have been enjoying learning how to take great shots with this camera. The paper book manual is very basic and will get you started right away. It is really easy to get started. It also has a little \"quick guide\" pamphlet so you can find basic functions fast. Then it comes with an in-depth reference manual on a CD-ROM. This I felt was a little inconvenient. I'd rather be able to page through a book quickly to find what I need, but others may like the CD-ROM manual. But I would not let that deter you from buying this camera.I bought this camera because of the higher resolution (the 2.11 megapixels) to be able to print quality photos. I plan on using Amazon's Ofoto site to have them printed as well as printing them on my Epson. Of course I love to email my photos to everyone as well. But so far the picture quality is great. Especially outdoor shots. The flash for indoor shots could be stronger. This seems to be the norm with digicams having a harder time indoors. Up close is fine but the back of the room is dark. There are ways around that using the manual mode. The software that came with the camera was very generic. So if you are very into editing, I would buy additional photo editing software.Additional things that I bought were rechargeable batteries and a charger. I drained the batteries that came with the camera in one day of usage. The LCD really drains the batteries. I also bought a 64mb compactflash card from Lexar. The 8mb is just not enough. Especially if you were to go on vacation. The Lexar card came with a jumpshot cable (a memory reader). It was very reasonabley priced. You just plug the cable into the USB port in your computer. Then you take the memory card out of the camera and put it into the reader. This helps out because you don't have to plug your camera in all the time to download your photos and it won't waste the batteries. Plus it is faster than the serial cable that comes with the camera. One thing I might mention about Lexar's jumpshot cables is that they will only read Lexar cards. But for the price of the card that included the jumpshot cable it was well worth it. And it was so easy to use.I still plan on getting a nicer case for my camera. One with more padding. And if you were go on vacation, you would need a spot for the batteries, the charger and also the software if you need to download it to a computer.All in all I am very happy with my purchase.

The only way I could even shut off  the camera was to open the battery bay. The comprehensive manual on CD said  that if this message appeared and a restart didn't fix the problem (it  didn't), the only action was to phone Nikon. Since this was a new camera,  right out of the box, I didn't bother, but packed it back up and returned  it the following day.  There are many good things about the camera, but in  my short time with it, other than the obvious fatal flaw, I noticed that  the battery compartment cover and smartcard cover were both very flimsy  (noted in other reviews).
