I had no idea of its capabilities until after I ordered it. While I was waiting for it to come I decided to watch Youtube videos to see what I was getting.I learned so much from this guy! He explains, and demonstrates, how excellent the pictures are on point and shoot, and shows that the zoom is brilliant! But he also shows you that this is the only point and shoot which you can grow with IF you want to. In other words, if you want to do more than point and shoot with this camera it offers options for you to choose your \"aperture, depth of field and lighting.\" I haven't done any of that, but it is all there on the camera IF you want to learn. I took a photo shooting directly into the sun, looking across the bay, and it came out beautifully! The camera does all the adjusting for lighting, even when pointing into the sun. Shots I took of the Olympic mountain range? Crystal clear and gorgeous! The zoom is powerful. Here is the guy to watch if you want to see all this camera is capable of. Great guy.

It arrived on time (needed overnight).  The value for what you pay is amazing.Tired of point and shoots with no control, and this has plenty of control for many levels of comfort.  The image stabilizing had me impressed.  16MP of quality resolution - not grainy, and the colors you want come through (even that glacier blue ;) ).  Has a fast enough shutter for almost any situation.  With standard 30x lens/120x digital, you get great zoom without needing to buy an additional lens (though that's always an option).  I always stay within the 30x lens zoom if I can help it, though because any digital zoom on any camera will start eating away at quality.I bought this kit because I didn't care to go looking 30 other places for accessories and probably end up paying more total.
