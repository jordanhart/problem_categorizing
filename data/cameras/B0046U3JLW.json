{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good video/ audio but unit needs a stronger magnet", "Author": "Lynn", "ReviewID": "R1U9YRE3PPFRAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm satisfied with the quality of the video-it is clear enough. The audio is fine as long as you remember to speak up a little when you're recording. The only problem with this product is that once the batteries were installed, it did not stay up on my fridge and slowly slide off. The light does blink if there is a new message, but only when the unit is turned on. It automatically shuts off when inactive for 10 seconds so you won't know if there is a new message for you unless you turn the unit on.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0046U3JLW"}}
