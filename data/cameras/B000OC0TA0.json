It's lightweight, and small enough to fit into a pocket. I was disappointed to discover that it doesn't have a flash, however, which limits the camera's use. That point isn't spelled out in the item description, so just be aware of that when considering this camera.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this camera!!!", "Author": "Meme", "ReviewID": "R1RL3W3VYX41EH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not waste your money on this terrible camera. My grandson was so excited to see the Spiderman faceplates, but the is the ONLY thing this camera has going for it, and he couldn't even get one to stay on anyway.the viewfinder is so small you can't see through it.  (No view screen), the camera is so lightweight it couldn't possibly last a day of picture taking with some five year olds!!!! The directions were hard even for grandpa or dad to figure out, let alone my grandson.  Confusing!!!!  Please look elsewhere for a camera for your children.  This one is a HUGE disappointment and I took it back the day after Christmas.  Still looking for a DECENT kids digital.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money", "Author": "Very Pleased", "ReviewID": "RSRT2G6X8QOHW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My 7 year old son got this for a Christmas preset from his grandparents and was super excited to take pictures.  He opened it up and breezed through the 26 pics that the camera could hold in a few minutes.  (He never even noticed that it had 3 removable faceplates but I guarantee that would have added to the excitement.)  We were concerned about the quality of the pics because it doesn't have a flash.  It also suprised me that it didn't have an LCD screen and had a very tiny viewfinder but he didn't seemed phased by that.  I was not surprised but still very disappointed when we downloaded the pics to the computer.  Almost all were either blurry or underexposed.  And the handful that looked properly exposed were still poor quality because the camera's best quality setting is only 0.3MP.  My son was disappointed enough that he said he didn't really care about it being Spiderman if that was the type of pics it would take.There are 2 pic resolution settings and 2 compression settings so you can end up with 4 different combinations... bottom line is that you can take somewhere between 26 and 208 photos.  On the best quality settings, the camera will take 26 pics and they are only 0.3 megapix.  (I gotta think the quality of the pics on the lowest setting would remind us of Atari games from the 1980s.)  I took a handful of pics in great lighting conditions with no camera movement to see if I could get better quality than my son... no improvement from his pics.  I don't know how much grandparents paid but they decided it's going back so they can return it for something that can take real pictures.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wish I never bought it", "Author": "Tiffany N.
