{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DON'T BUY THIS! Misleading product description, overpriced, and incompatible \"combo\" components.", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "RXWDP7RT9OIJG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This \"combo\" includes the Hero 3+ Black (with slim housing) and LCD Touch Bacpac #ALCDB-301 (for Hero 2/3, so housing back doors are not compatible w/ the slim housing). It should have included the Bacpac #ALCDB-303 to be compatible. The description excluded this critical information, so I assumed that surely the \"combo\" would be compatible -- but it wasn't. Plus, if I had bought the camera separate from the LCD Bacpac kit, it would have been $50+ cheaper; I thought that the combo included an extra housing for the extra money (camera comes with slim housing, I thought that the Bacpac came with the older-style waterproof-to-60m housing but it doesn't. It just comes with the back doors for the older-style housing, which don't fit on the newer slim housing). Very disappointing to be misled and overcharged.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E0KV4FQ"}}
