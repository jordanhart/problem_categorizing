I decided to start looking for a family printer/camera combo and came across this one at a local store. I checked on Amazon and found it much cheaper with special offers to boot!! Anyway the camera is excellent with enough features and options for the casual photographer. The size is just right and i can easly put it in my pocket with it being just a little larger than a clamshell mobile phone. The photo process was so simple my 6 year old was printing pictures and the quality is equal to standard developed pictures. Another great feature is when you place your camera on the printer dock its recharging the kodak supplied rechargeable batteries so your always ready to go. I trully was amazed at the quality of the photos and no computer is needed to print out amazing shots. This kit is well thought out and Kodak includes EVERYTHING you need to get going, rechargeable batteries and all the cables needed to hook up to the computer whether just the camera or the printer its all there no need to run to the store and buy anything your ready to go out of the box. You get a 10 sheet sample pack of photo paper and ink which we used up the first day just taking shots around the house. I ordered the PH160 by Kodak off of amazon which gives me a .23 per picture average which equals our local store. The great quality, ease of use with the camera and printer, excellent picture quality with no extras to buy equals a solid value by Kodak right out of the box. **Do not be fooled by other printer combos as many do not include cables, batteries, ink, paper etc. and upon purchasing these items the price is right up to the initial kodak combo price.**", "Date": "December 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier!", "Author": "Gerri S. \"just enjoying life\"", "ReviewID": "R589U368924AT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After nearly numbing my brain researching a variety of cameras and reading all the reviews for each I settled on this particular model.  I received this camera on 11/28/2005 and have given it a real workout taking pix of my grandson who was born 4 days later. With the exception of a few photos which were a little out of focus due to, I believe, operator error the photos have been wonderful. I have not taken any outdoor shots as yet but I can't imagine the quality being any different.  I have not tried out all the different settings which include ones for snow and beach and children and more.The printer has worked perfectly and makes beautiful prints.  As for the ink cartridge and paper - I have never run out of ink before I ran out of paper.  It has been my experience that the \"low ink\" message appears when about three sheets are left but it has printed the remaining sheets perfectly before the message tells you to replace the cartridge.  By the way I have taken and printed approximately 70 photos.  You may or may not consider that limited experience.I took all my photos set on the minimum megapixel setting because I didn't want to run out of memory.  So I decided to purchase more memory. Now I look forward to changing the setting so that I can make enlargements.As for the Easyshare program - it is great.  You can download the photos and arrange them in \"albums\" with dates which makes it easier to go back and retrieve them quickly.  You can email directly from the Easyshare program.  Among the things the program does is let you crop, enhance, and work on any red-eye problems plus other fun features. I have also used the downloading feature where I downloaded some of my favorites including ones I had \"played\" with(as in cropping, etc) to a CD and took to my favorite neighborhood store and made copies using their \"self-serve\" equipment.  Very easy to do.Obviously you may get more features with a higher grade Kodak digital but this camera suits my needs and you can't beat the price.  With the current offer I received the travel case which is great since it holds the camera, the docking station, print tray and all accessories.  This all in one package is perfect for taking to special occasions where you might want to put an album together on the spot for the honoree.Oh, by the way, at the hospital someone picked up my camera and promptly dropped it while handing it to me.  It hit the floor and I cringed but the camera had no external damage and obviously no internal damage either since I have taken about 50 pix since with perfect results.If I ever decide to upgrade my digital camera I will stay with Kodak.  And I will already have the docking station and printer! Guess you could say I am very pleased with the product.You don't have to be a rocket scientist to operate this camera.  I am definitely not a hi-tech person and I don't care for convoluted instructions or buttons and knobs that make your eyes cross, so I found this camera to be perfect for me.Hope you find this review helpful.", "Date": "December 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "A good camera and printer bundle.", "Author": "Vyshtia", "ReviewID": "R5WB7EV64O3OT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good and simple bundle to get as a gift for someone who's more on the technology challenged side.  I bought this bundle for my Mom and it was a perfect gift for her.  The camera is good and easy to use.  The printer was a little bit harder to figure out, but once we figured it out, it's now easy to use.  It's a good bundle gift because it comes with everything you need to get started; camera, printer, and all the accessories you need.  I would buy two additional items with this bundle: a larger memory card and more photo printer.  16MB memory card is too small, and you will burn through the 10 pieces of photo paper that it comes with very quickly.She loves that she's able to take pictures and print them out right away.  She hasn't quite learnt/understand the concept of keeping digital files on the computer, but she understands the concept of taking a picture and then printing it out right away.  This camera is different than many digital cameras nowadays in that it also has labels for the commonly used buttons on the back.  This helps my mom greatly because she can't remember what every little icon means.  This camera also has the look and feel of a \"traditional\" camera.  Sometimes the cameras that would appeal to someone that is more technologically savvy, really intimidates those who are not.  This is a very good package that gives you new technology without being intimidating.I would say it's a good package gift, but if you're looking for high quality, high technology, you'll do better getting separate units.", "Date": "November 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Loving it so far", "Author": "Mspill", "ReviewID": "R38UVTYLNRFEJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from Amazon a couple of weeks ago.

I purchased rechargeable batteries and I would say they lasted for about 70 shots a charge. I would also recommend a large memory card which I got. A good purchase for $200 complete. You can't beat it.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with it, it also replaced my camcorder", "Author": "A. TITUS", "ReviewID": "RC306XJAA8JJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with this purchase in basically every respect. Pictures are of very good quality, the screen, buttons, battery door and memory chip door are fine (the latter of which is of a bad design on the C330), although this is not of the build quality of my old $600 SLR camera, if you are taking 100 shots a day you won't be spending only $155 on a camera will you? Another $100 gets you better build quality but not necessarily a better, easier to use camera. This camera has a decent sized glass lens and enough zoom to cover the 3 lenses I had with my SLR, 35mm to 102mm. The lens has a built in auto lens cover. 2 Ni-metal AA's gets me through more than a day's worth of vacation shooting, at least 50 with the screen on all of the time (then I recharge every evening, so can't tell you how many per charge.) Both the view finder and the screen show the zoom.I administer a small computer network and I deal with complicated computer issues sometimes, which is another reason I like this camera and the software, its so simple you hardly need a manual for it, and that makes it fast to learn and fast to use.Technically speaking, this camera has quite good exposure latitude, being able to turn a dusk photo into a daylight looking one, when on a tripod. Exposure compensation is broad, if you like to play with that, and the various exposure modes will cover all of the situations for normal and travel photography, enough for any one who doesn't require a full manual capable SLR. The shutter's maximum speed is well over 1/1000 sec. This camera like all consumer digi cams has a lag before firing the shutter, but it is much quicker than my 2 MP Olympus, this C340 laging no more than 1 sec., and usually much less, according to the daylight situations I usually shoot in.Unless you plan on making large prints, eg 10 x 16 on a regular basis, or shooting in volume, this is plenty of camera. Frankly if you need more camera than this one, you'd know that already.The Kodak software is very good and very easy to use and learn, and has many practical features.This camera can act as a camcorder and it has replaced my analog camcorder. I get 45 mins of video (with 2 gig memory) at full resolution (640 x 480) with audio and the camera plays back the video with the audio! The quality of video doesn't match a true camcorder but this it is so great and simple having both in one, I don't mind. No more $7 tapes to buy and I can edit the films on my laptop.Now can they put a phone into it?", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Superb pictures, below-par battery performance.", "Author": "Christy L. \"scrappy_mom\"", "ReviewID": "R2M3L0NUAU4EO1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a long-time Kodak fan and user of their cameras and printer docks.  After dropping and breaking my CX7430 (I also reviewed this camera and the 6000 printer dock), my husband bought this camera for me this past Christmas.  Although I am happy with the overall performance, it is not without flaws, some of which could be a dealbreaker.  I much preferred my CX7430 to this model, but I must admit the C340 is growing on me, despite its faults.  I'm an avid scrapbooker, and my toddler-aged son and husband are the main \"targets\" of my photography obsession.POSITIVES:  Thus far I am very pleased with the print quality. It is outstanding, and up to the standards you expect from Kodak.  I get fantastic enlargements from Snapfish, thanks to the generous megapixels for a reasonable price.  The controls are well laid-out and easy to use.  The size is perfect, small enough to easily carry in a purse or bag, yet large enough for a comfortable hold.It performs well in low light, and the screen gains up considerably to give a good LCD view.  The LCD is remarkably bright and visible even on days where the sun is bright and glare seems to be everywhere.  The macro function produces breathtaking results, which we thoroughly enjoyed testing at the Butterfly Conservatory.  Outdoor shots are captured quickly and easily, with very little lag between rapid \"firing\".  The Sport function is excellent for subjects in motion, and captures fast-paced moments in time beautifully.  It also creates really fun shots if you're shooting, say, a child splashing around in mud puddles.  The flash does a great job of auto-adjusting.  The self-timer is also great!  Perfect for quick group portraits.For only $9.99, I was able to purchase a dock adapter that allowed me to continue to use my EasyShare 6000 printer dock, rather than be forced into unnecessarily purchasing another dock.  My 6000 prints quality pictures that I am exceptionally happy with, and from my personal experience are the exact same quality of the newer docks.NEGATIVES:  The battery life on this camera is absolutely terrible.  I use a rechargeble Kodak battery pack and my printer dock as the charging station.  I am able to get no more than 50 pictures before the battery is completely drained.  I have tried everything imaginable to fix this - regular AA's, a new Kodak battery pack, and many different name-brand rechargable batteries.  I *might* get an additional 5-10 pictures from the Kodak pack, but overall the effect is the same.  With my CX7430 I could get an average of 300 pictures before the battery began to blink out.  An e-mail to Kodak Tech Support suggested doing all of the things I have already done (does anyone bother to read what we write?), and no further assistance was offered after I pointed out that these things had been done.Additionally, the main control disc is VERY loose, and the camera is easily powered on when placed inside a purse, bag, or even its custom case.  This drains the battery incredibly, even if only left on for a short time.  Even if you double check the camera after placement into the bag, the simple motion of walking is enough to jostle the control and power the camera back on.  It is more than a little disappointing to leave for a function with fully charged batteries, only arrive there with a dead camera.  Knowing that you have spare batteries isn't reassuring, knowing that each expensive set of batteries will net you only 50 or so pictures, and a lot of time and frustration.Overall, if you are unconcerned with frequent battery changes and charges, you will receive an excellent picture quality for a great price.  However, I can't say I'd count on this model if you're like me, and enjoy taking hundreds of successive shots to capture that one photo you can't live without.  The time is takes for frequent battery changes is a PITA, and more than once I have lost a moment thanks to yet another set of dead batteries.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "Two Blue Hands", "ReviewID": "R1G0MKY5JBTMU5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the bundled after a long research process.

Since I did not get the dock (bought the camera in Istanbul, Turkey), the camera came with just \"start-up\" batteries, AA, which is a convenient idea. But the batteries died after I played with the camera and had taken just 38 pictures and a 14 second video. Next I went through 2 Duracell batteries with 55 pictures taken. Then went on to nearly use up 2 more the same day.The second problem is that unless you use the LCD screen to set up the pictures, you can't use the digital zoom range for images that are really far away. Only the optical zoom range is viewable through the viewfinder. As well, without using the LCD screen, B&W;, Sepia effects are not viewable through the viewfinder. If you have the color settings changed to B&W;, the image in the viewfinder is color but when you take the picture the image is B&W.; Of course a lot of cameras are now coming out without viewfinders at all, and I prefer to use the LCD screen typically, but sometimes you NEED to use the viewfinder.The LCD screen itself is OK, some reviewers had said it was small and did not display images so that you could tell if a picture was crisp or not, but even our Nikon Coolpix E5700 is that way and I think the screen is OK. Some reviewers had suggested upgrading to the Easy Share C360, noting that a larger LCD screen was the only difference in the 2 models.I am very pleased with the speed at which the camera operates. I can whip it out and turn it on and take a picture spontaneously without waiting for more than 5 seconds. The camera has a fast recovery time, both without and with flash, but the recovery time does lag a little with some multiple settings, for example; longer recovery for macro plus flash. The menu is very functional and user friendly without having read the manual.**OK I have been using the camera for 3 weeks now and have one last complaint or two. This camera has a serious case of \"Objects in mirror appear further than they really are.\" This means that in order to take a photo that will appear as the true distance from the camera, you have to use the zoom, otherwise the picture looks like it was taken from WAY further away than it really was. Thus, when you use the digital zoom for objects that are really far away, the picture quality is less. I am going to guess that this is because of the size of the camera and its components.I am really struggling with close-ups using the macro and actually the Kodak Easy Share CX6330 with 3.1 MP did a better job with it. By the way, you CAN use flash with macro, but you have to set the flash manually.I have switched to the Kodak Ni-MH Rechargeable batteries, since I went through 7 sets of AA batteries in less than a week of having the camera. With the new batteries, I have been able to take about 200 pictures (in a matter of a few days) AND get them uploaded each time without having the batteries die. I was recently out for 4 hours in Istanbul taking lots of random shots, turning the camera on and off, using the LCD screen, playing with the settings, took over 100 photos and the \"Low battery\" indicator has yet to appear, so I am very pleased with the switch.I am not much into video, but the video quality is really nice when the lighting is good. You can't use digital zoom for video. The audio is pretty good too providing that the object you want to hear is fairly close to the camera. If a person is standing 6 feet away and speaking clearly, you will get decent audio and very good video. My results from video of scenery at varying distances without using zoom are very good. I have taken video while driving, and just standing and taking panoramic video of my surroundings and both have given great results. You can shoot video in \"continuous mode\" or set the camera to take  5, 15, or 30 second video. The latter is great feature if you want to share videos on the internet with family and friends without having to think about whether or not you have just taken a very long video and not having to worry about long upload times.Overall, for this being a \"point and shoot\" camera, it does its job pretty well as long as the battery issue is resolved. I have taken some really nice quality photographs (some I consider my all-time favorite photos) with the camera already. The owner's manual tips for prolonging the battery life (not using the LCD screen as viewfinder, not reviewing your pictures using the LCD screen) are great but you can't adequately utilize the camera features without using the LCD screen, thus draining the batteries. It's kinda hard to accept those tips and expect great pictures since so much of trying to capture great images is trial and error. Also note that the manual says that Battery performance is reduced at temperatures below 41?F.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Kodak EasyShare C340 5MP Digital Camera", "Author": "K. W.

This is a summary of our experience with them. Overall rating: 'Wish we'd chosen something else'.Pros: Picture quality is OK for our uses.Cons:* While the camera has a USB interface (with cable supplied) it is NOT recognised as a standard mass storage device, so your options are to either install the horribly bloated, insultingly dumbed down and inflexible 'Easyshare' software (which wouldn't even work on one of our older PCs), or, you can buy a flash card reader. Which is what I did.I'll never buy another camera that requires any special software on the PCs it's used with. I just want to transfer the image files to where ever I want to put them in my filesystem, on any PC, with minimum fuss.* Astonishingly, when the camera is plugged into the USB cable, it is still running off batteries. If they go flat during image transfers, file corruption can result. Also, this means you can't use the camera to take photos while 'plugged in' thus saving battery life and allowing lengthy use. Another reason it's best to just use a flash card reader.* Fragility, poor reliability. Of our three cameras, two are now broken and unusable. The third is still OK, due to hardly ever being used. The broken two had similar histories - minor knocks broke the miniscule plastic retaining tabs on the battery cover (causing endless nuisance improvising ways to hold the cover on), and later both cameras just suddenly stopped working. On power-up, the status LED blinks a few times (presumably some error code, no mention of which in the manual), then goes dead. Screen remains black.* Battery life (or rather, lack of it.) As many have commented, this camera chews batteries. It takes two AAs, and with even the best non-rechargables you won't be filling up a 256MB flash card on one set of batteries. You'll be lucky to get 30 pictures. If you want to save money and use rechargables, you'll get even less shots per charge, since rechargables batteries are typically 1.2V, compared to alkaline's 1.5V. The camera seems to have a fairly high threshold for 'dead', and so on rechargables this camera conks out well before the battery is actually flat.  For this factor alone, I'll never buy another 'cheap' Kodak camera.* However, of all the camera's 'features', the most infuriating and unacceptable is the selector knob. Some Kodak product designer needs to be fired for this. (Or shot.) The knob has unbelievably weak detents - it rotates between OFF and the various modes at a feather touch. Since the knob sticks up on the top of the camera, this means that no matter how careful you are when it is being carried (even in a camera bag) it will get switched on accidentally. Often. This combined with the extremely short battery life, means that if you want to be sure to get pictures, you have to carry _several_ spare sets of batteries.Overall, our experience with these was rather disappointing. Sure, they were relatively low cost, but to have two out of three die so quickly, seems very poor.

My previous Kodak was a great camera and perfect for my needs - family photos, eBay, and an occasional creative endeavor like a greeting card. I have had this camera for around a year and a half and have been really disappointed. The photos are generally good quality, but there are several major drawbacks. First, the camera eats batteries like crazy. Be prepared to change batteries constantly. Second, the printer dock works sporadically - sometimes it will not recognize the computer and everything needs to be shut down and restarted. The printer dock is also very \"plastically\" feeling - insubstantial - and the ink and printer paper are pricey. I have gone back to getting my photos through an online retailer. Last, the camera can take awhile to power up - and sometimes won't power up at all, even if the batteries are relatively fresh. The warning light just flashes red then shuts down. This has cost me more than a couple great pictures.

It is easy to use, and the supplied software works well.  It takes great quality photos with good detail and color.  I've found it works well indoors and outdoors, in both low light and bright light situations.  It is adequate for close-up work and works very well for family gatherings and landscape shots.The 1GB SD card supplied with the camera is good for my particular needs, and the camera's optical + digital zoom works well.My two complaints about the camera are:First, the batteries seem to go dead rapidly, even if the camera is turned off and not being used.  I can count on needing new batteries with almost every photo session.  It uses up batteries much faster than competng units I've seen in the same price range, or in higher price ranges.Second, in high-light or low-light situations, it is almost impossible to see anything useful in the digital viewer: the viewer is very washed out or very dark (even though you can be reasonably certain the final image will turn out well).At the time I bought this unit, I felt it was the best quality unit available in its price range.

Kennedy \"Artsy Fartsy\"", "ReviewID": "R15V1FEFL2MAES", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have marginal experience with this product.  I've owned it around 18 months and had mixed results.Overall Ease of Use:So long as it turns on, it's more or less point and shoot.  No worrying about depth of field, aperture, etc, just aim and push the button.A lot of people will talk about the different settings it has...  action, close-up, etc.  It's all crap.  None of these exotic sounding features ever work like they're supposed to.  For example, if you ever try to take a photo of a sunset or thundercloud, you will be very upset, because this camera doesn't understand when you want it to work like a plain old normal camera and not try to bump up the exposure.  So if you do try, you end up with a well exposed foreground, and a background that is pale and washed out.Also, the camera's sensor produces drastically different pictures depending which angle you have it aimed.If you think you see cool clouds, the camera's sensor wants to blow things out, so to get them to look good, you must hold the camera at a bizarre angle that lets the proper amount of light in.Reliability:Low.  If your Kodak batteries aren't just charged 5 minutes ago, you have about 20 shots you can take before it's drained.  Then again, I went to a wedding and wanted to take some snapshots.  I put some relatively fresh batteries in, put it in my pocket, and then found out I had accidentally turned it on and the batteries were dead.  No Auto-Off there or anything, so my girlfriend and I hope we everyone else's pictures turned out well.General Picture Quality:Depends... mediocre to bad.  As everyone says, if you're in a low lighted room, you're screwed... unless you use flash, when you can be screwed because the camera loves to overexpose when you use flash.  I've noticed if you go into the menu and manually turn down the low light compensation you can get your pictures to look better.  Even in this situation, the flash has a tendency to give everything in the room the same amount of light, annoyingly flattening the image.If you're lucky enough to be in a bright situation, you STILL have to be careful, as the camera seems to have a nack for picking up a lot of UV haze.  You'll take a picture and then wonder why everything is so friggin foggy.  Additionally, you will also remark aloud of this when you try to view a picture at its full 5 megapixel resolution.I still have to experiment a bit with the ISO adjustments that can be made to the camera (which sounds like a pretty good amount of control to have for such a dinky camera), but almost all pictures taken with this camera have a ridiculous amount of grain and fog.  It just looks like you've zoomed in 200% on a 2.1 mp photo.  It's my opinion that the camera's CCD provides its best output when you save your pictures at 2.1mp.As a matter of fact, one of the best pictures I've ever taken in my life is the result of this camera at 2.1mp.  Lit from the side with ambient light, it was perfect.Video Function:Like gritty 8mm footage, but not so smooth.  My camera's mic distorts on high frequencies too now, so that anytime I record voice, it makes me sound like I have a lisp.  This is fun for birthday cake blowing out footage, but I can't imagine ever wanting to record anything important with it.Included Software:Installed it once and regretted the hassle it made every time I wanted to look at my photos.  With my new computer, I just use the Windows software.Included Printer:Never used it.  It makes a lovely charger though.Overall Opinion:This camera, if you're looking for snapshots and willing to sift through to find the goodies is good.  It's not consistent, but if you're lucky and careful, you CAN make some gems with it.  Those looking for crystal clear resolution, spend more money, maybe get a Canon or a Nikon... you'll be happier in the end.For more artistic control for less money, go out and buy a film SLR for 50 bucks at a pawn shop.

This was 2005. The trade-in got me 2 more mp and worked the same way. I have the same complaint about the rotating switch--very easily turned on by mistake.Rechargeable AA's were my choice from the start, and I typically carried 6 batteries with me and several SD cards on excursions. I have been very pleased with the quality of the pictures. I recently uploaded several videos of a luna moth my daughter found. The stills yielded many nice close-ups, but I think for this quality of camera, they were above and beyond what it is capable of, as far as very close pictures. The manual said something like arm's length for the flower setting. For a 4- to 5- inch moth, pretty good! The videos are not as high resolution as the close-up pix were [you can see them on the DanniStories Channel on YouTube]. But, they are VGA...adequate for YouTube.The battery door is easy for my daughter to open and hard for my arthritic hands, but you don't want it popping open. Changing sets of batteries and SD cards was a breeze. I take a lot of video, but hundreds of stills daily on trips. I don't travel often, but I like to have a camera ready.My camera has always had the problem detecting the batteries...sometimes I have to rotate the switch on and off several times before it is ready to shoot, and at first, it fooled me into thinking I just had dead rechargeables. Now it is having the problem more and more frequently.I have no experience with SLR's and a bit of experience with 35mm simple cameras before I went digital in 2000. Since going digital, I take as many pictures as my hard drive will hold.This camera has been a good experience, despite the problems. I have missed some shots, but had very good timing mostly, to get the shots I want for the family album.Kodak overall outdid my little HP C200, but the tech was better. HP is a bit on the blue side still with the webcams on my computers. Kodak color is fantastic.My first Kodak got a dent in the lens outer casing and would not retract any more. I should have put it in a case. This Kodak, despite the problems, gave me pictures that I liked. But, I would like to get higher resolution for close ups and better tech. I don't know if I will go Kodak or Canon this time. I am amazed at how far the tech has come, and I am hoping I can find a camera that will last this long.

When it does turn on, you can maybe get a single picture before it shuts off.Second, the USB cable doesn't work.When customer service was called, they told me that they only recommend using the rechargable batteries.

I have found more and more things wrong with the camera and am so disgusted with it that I am buying a different one.  My brother and I both have the same cameras (Christmas gift from our parents) and he is experiencing the same problems.  It is not just my camera that seems to have these problems!First, the flash is VERY bright.  I am constantly having to turn off the flash and turn on a room light just to get a decent picture.  If I leave the flash on, his eyes are half-closed and he looks drunk.  If I do not have the flash on, then the pictures are too dark.  I've tried ALL the 4 or 5 setting for the flash and none of them correct this problem!  I also frequently get red-eyes in my pictures even when I'm using the red eye flash!Second, the batteries!  I have the WORST time with the batteries for this camera! They die within ONE day for me! I don't even have to have the camera turned on and it is dead the next time I try to use it! I switched from using the rechargeable batteries to the regular AA batteries just so I can depend on my camera to turn on when I want a quick picture of my son.  The AA's drain SO fast that I go through (literally) 3-4 sets of batteries in a given month and I do NOT take that many pictures.  My brother has the same camera and he has experienced the same problems!Third, the dock!  Most of the time I have to fiddle with the dock and have the camera tilted in just the right position to get the dock to recognize that the camera is attached to it.  It often turns off, even in the middle of transferring pictures.  I have tried 4-5 different power outlets, and the dock acts the same way in each of them.Fourth, the picture quality only deteriorates! When I first received the camera the pictures were of adequate/good quality.  However, now ALL of them are blurry!  Every single one that I take is blurry whether I'm moving or not, whether the target of the picture is moving or not, and even when using the camera function (sports, I believe) that is supposed to account for movement.  None of it works now and every picture is very blurry.Today was the last straw with this camera.  I put new batteries in it just yesterday since I knew that I would be taking pictures of my son today.  I went to turn it on, and it did NOTHING! I tried 5 or 6 times to turn it on and it did nothing.  I eventually changed the batteries, and tried to turn it on on a different setting, and it still did nothing.  I finally brought the camera in to show it to my husband and it finally turned on after he tried a couple of times to turn it on.In sum, this camera has many problems and it only gets worse as the camera gets older.  I would have expected much better quality on a camera that is about $100.  My camera is approximately one year old and has been performing very, very, very poorly for at least the last 6 months, starting to have problems for at least 9 months, and only worked well for about 2-3 weeks after I got it.  Save yourself the time and money and don't buy this camera.  I am buying a more expensive one and hoping for better luck!", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "battery killer/bad connector", "Author": "Busy Mom", "ReviewID": "R1L6BPBHGXS7LG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to be easy to carry to family gatherings and other good point and shoot events.  I already own a Nikon D70 that I use to take the \"good\" pictures, but it is too heavy to lug everywhere with my 3 kids, so I needed something more portable.I'll give it 2 stars because it did manage some nice exposures in auto mode on a tough day when I was taking pictures of people in the shade with a sunlit snowy background.I picked this particular camera because everyone raved about the ease of use and the price. I guess it is easy to use if you are one of those people who likes the easy button and to let the software do all the work for you, but we use several digital cameras in our family and I like to keep things organized on my computer the way I want them, not the way someone decided the software should do it.a few problems:1. On the first use, I went through 4 sets of batteries in one day taking pictures at a family gathering...ouch! so much for saving money. It really needs more than 2 AA's to run.  I could purchase the dock and rechargable kodak proprietary battery (my aunt says that battery lasts longer) but I don't want to clutter my desk with a camera dock.ALSO, when the betteries get low the delay time from press the button to shutter open gets downright long...2.  All of our other cameras use the same mini usb connector to connect to the computer, we have one cord and it is always out on the desk to hook up whichever camera we need.  This camera uses USB but has some different smaller usb connector and would have required us to keep another cable.  seems stupid, like it is just another wak for kodak to make you use their stuff.I guess if you want the dock and the kodak rechargeable battery this camera would be OK, but I do agree with another review I read that the dial is very loose, so it is easy for the camera to be turned on accidentally if it is in a bigger bag.  I travel with a diaper bag and wanted to be able to throw the camera in, so that doesn't really work for me either.Fortunately I was able to return this camera to where I bought it.  I like the feel of the less expensive canons much better, I think I will try one of those next.good luck out there...", "Date": "December 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Greatest Camera Set Ever", "Author": "A.

This camera was purchased by someone who is no longer here. If you want a reliable camera that takes decent shots, don't buy this camera.  I carry this camera in a bag and it always turns itself on so the batteries get wasted.  It doesn't always turn on the first time you switch it on.  You have to switch to a special mode to get a decent close-up shot.  It can't handle shots in dim lighting so unless it's really sunny out or a really well-lit room, forget about using this camera.
