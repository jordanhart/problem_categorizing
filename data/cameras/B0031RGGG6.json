{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent value for the money", "Author": "Guillermo Ramhorst", "ReviewID": "RTKV84Y5EIODU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've bought this camera for my 12 year-old daughter to go out on a school explorers day, and as well for my 6 year-old daughter. I must confess that I am amazed with how easy is to get good pictures with it. For sure you cannot compare them with other, higher price cameras, but its focus is fast, the Smart Capture is amazingly effective and the startup time to get that instant shot is pretty fast. The operation is very intuitive. The viewer is big, the controls are very well thought out, with all the key functions you'd like to set on a point-and-shoot available at a specific button or one or two clicks away.The only thing I could mention is that it did not came with the TV cable (although it's available as extra).As for the software installation, on one PC I've installed the Easy Share button while on another I've just plugged it in. On the first the Easy Share button software comes up and guides you to download the photos to your PC and gives you the option to erase them from the card. On the second, it behaved as if it were a USB drive, so Picasa automatically dicovers it and you just import with it. The website and manual explain that you have to \"reset\" the option of the share button for it to install on more than one machine, so even that situation was easily covered after a glance through the manual.Runs with 2 AA batteries and battery life is excellent. Buy a box of 4 of NiMH rechargables and you'll have them for a whole weekend.I think it's an ideal equipment if you want to give someone an easy, fool-proof device that you won't regret if it gets lost or damaged.Considering the price, I feel like I did a wonderful buy and definetely recommend it.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera Plus", "Author": "lashlarue", "ReviewID": "RBH3QDV42IVZS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little C142 Digital camera works very well.

Not even close.The pictures are fuzzy and they blur VERY easily. If anything is moving, most often the ENTIRE picture will blur, not just the moving object. I even have to hold my breath on many occasions to keep the picture from blurring.It auto-adjusts itself and focuses on whatever it pleases, not what you want it to, then blurs the rest of the picture except for its focused object.It drinks battery power and lags quite a bit on taking pictures. The zoom is awful and the \"easy share\" option is far from easy.The buttons are difficult to manage and the scene selections are next to worthless.Overall, I would say it's not worth the money and once this one has run it's course, I will not be purchasing it again, or recommending it to anyone.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "M. Sayre", "ReviewID": "RGIWORVJVKU2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is much better than I expected it to be and I feel it is a very good value if you have less than a $100 to spend on a camera. It looks great and fits easily into my hands. The viewscreen in the back is very nice and I'm able to adjust settings very easily. Also, it linked with my desktop computer quickly and the upload process is quick and easy. When you use the flash indoors the photos come out crisp and sharp- in fact I was amazed at the clarity of the pictures. I first used it to photograph items I'm selling in eBay and I got great pics up close just using the zoom feature. I would highly recommend this camera for every day use inside and out and for basic close-up work.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Bubbalouie", "ReviewID": "R3HETT4QZRDRCB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is a good buy for the money. It is knida flimsy and lightweight but it seems to do the job. I have no operational complaints and it seems to work just as described but I expected more out of the zoom. That was my fault for not doing more research.

Hagen", "ReviewID": "R3GO076T69FD89", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wouldn't use this camera if you paid me to. Indeed, I was literally paid to use this camera for work, and experienced not one satisfactory moment with it. It seems to take passable photos, once you can figure out its nonsensical user interface, but good luck loading these pictures onto your computer. I'm a mac user, and maybe the experience is different for PC users, but I highly doubt it. The camera insists that you load some ridiculous Kodak software before you can import your photos, and once you go through these odious steps the camera still fails to load most of its photos onto the computer properly. Just a total waste of time. Absolute garbage on a massive scale. Everyone involved with this project should be fired immediately for lack of imagination and failure to understand the economy in which they are trying to participate. This product is just a total failure in every way. Even the fact that the device turns on when you push the \"power\" button is an awful tease that leaves you less satisfied than you were the moment before you set your eyes upon this cursed plastic trap.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.95", "Features": "10-megapixel resolution for stunning prints up to 30 x 40 inches\n3x optical zoom\n2.7-inch LCD with KODAK Color Science Technology\nKodak's Smart Capture feature; Face Recognition feature\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Kodak Easyshare C142 10 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Zoom and 2.5-Inch LCD (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51otp%2BHC9QL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0031RGGG6"}}
