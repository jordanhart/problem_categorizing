It's pink and is actually pretty cool looking.I really miss the \"triple flash\" setting that i've used on all other Casio camera's that i've owned.I LOVE the feature where i can record video by pushing a button and while recording... i can take photo's!I thought this camera was awesome mainly because of the release date.  This camera is brand new in late 2010, released by Casio.They don't even have it on their website yet to register!  LOL  So, i figured... brand new technology.Anyhow... either i got a dud or there is an issue with this camera.After the 2nd day... the camera started giving BUSY errors between shots.  We replaced the SD card and that did not help.  Then the camera started wiping the SD card... automatically!  I lost several pictures.  I put in a different SD card and it got wiped too!  So, it's going back.  It's just too new and again, either the bugs have not been worked out yet or... i simply got a dud.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Faulty Merchandise", "Author": "Steven L.

Stewart", "ReviewID": "R1ECP4JXPBT2KX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Camera works fine for me I hope as a pocket camera. Very easy to set up or just leave it alone and let it do the work. It has good features if you want to experiment. My only real problem is I received this on march 23 2011 once I charged it up and made sure it worked I followed the directions to Casio to register it. and found that although it is still for sale all over the place. Cassia no longer will register it or provide software updates. You cannot access this model in the web page given to register it. After several emails bouncing me around casio I called the support telephone number and was told this model has been removed and archived. I have to say they did not careless. I was told it was archived and no further updates software or otherwise would be forthcoming. If you chose to buy this save your receipt or invoice as proof you will need to return it to the store. I could not even get any warranty information. So I really I have no Idea what will happen if I need it. The good news is the software stinks anyway pretty much anything that can read a usb port camera will treat it as a usb storage device and download the pictures. Before you buy just remember it is a dead product. The support lady pretty much blew me off. So don't expect much. You may have better luck if it is a technical issue but you will need to call them as you need to give your model from a drop down list and like I said it is not listed anymore. The low rating is mainly I have never bought a product I could not access updates, Manuals, even discontinued (but sold) products.Support Was, Well I will never buy a casio again lets leave it at that.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0041J30SU"}}
