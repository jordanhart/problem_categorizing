{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cheap usable digital camera", "Author": "Steve Ayres \"bearuk\"", "ReviewID": "R3RRVT4HEHF86Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "In brief, if money is tight then this is an ok camera. If you want good quality images then you don't want the FE-46, save for something better.My canon G9 camera recently suffered a lens error which is common to Canon designs, the lens popped out and stuck leaving the camera unusable.I wanted an inexpensive replacement camera in case my Canon was not repaired in time for Christmas, and saw the Olympus FE-46.It's a camera made to a price, and it's priced very keenly.  You should accept that the price means a lot of sacrifices have been made. To begin you will find you need to buy a memory card as Olympus doesn't include one (although they do include a micro SD to XD converter in the box).The LCD display is large and easy to see. There are a number of different modes, such as fully automatic; SCN - which offers portraits, night shot, fireworks, action etc.; iauto - which attempts to guess the type of scene; and the totally worthless 'digital image stabilization'.Olympus apparently aren't alone in blatantly lying about image stabilization in their cameras. Image stabilization is a great feature that allows you to take sharp photos in lower than usual light. This camera doesn't have it. The Olympus 'digital image stabilization' simply increases the sensitivity of the sensor, allowing a faster shutter speed to reduce blur.  Increasing the sensitivity of the sensor gives noisy, unusable images.On the subject of image quality the Olympus is poor. My images (taken at 12MP / fine quality) aren't sharp and lack detail; the colors are washed out and there is color fringing around objects.Admittedly my Canon G9 was a much more expensive camera, but these days almost everyone has a phone with a camera built in, and Olympus has to compete with these devices at this price.  Apart from the pixel count the FE-46 has nothing special to offer, the picture quality isn't good enough to make carrying a seperate camera worthwhile.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's not that bad", "Author": "Snowy Marigold", "ReviewID": "R2HNB16SGGCK33", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't find this camera to be as bad as the other reviewers have said. It's a cheap-ish point and shoot. Given that, it takes decent pictures. They're best in natural light (as all are), but it takes good shots in well lighted interiors as well. It has a ton of scenes to choose from. The zoom is better than most. It's small. It's easy to use, I understand the manual and I like the software that comes with it.Its biggest downfall is low-light photos. Picture quality declines substantially. If I know I'll be taking low-light photos, I grab my big ol' Canon (that I can't just throw in my purse.)All in all, the Olympus is a good little camera.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "What a bunch of cry-babies", "Author": "Darren W. Olsen", "ReviewID": "R2Q9D1DZIRVWO2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is inexpensive, but it takes photos fine. Don't expect Canon body-only quality unless you want to spend at least 500 dollars. Even Sony can't match that.For the money, this as good as a \"Sony\". It will take pictures just like you would expect from a film camera of same quality. If you want professional, then put your money where your mouth is, and shell out some serious money.The FE46 is easy to use, it is durable, and takes nice pictures for a digital camera.As far as the rest of the cry-baby tech-geeks are concerned: go suck on your bottles.I sure can't complain about my purchase. Sure I would just love a professional camera, but I can't afford one.I am happy.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus FE-46, Great Compact Camera!", "Author": "C.T. \"C.T.\"", "ReviewID": "R1RFN5LGISAXD0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for an compact inexpensive camera to use at the NHRA Races and other events.This camera really does take great pictures.

I saw a Nikon coolpix camera that was the same mp and virtually same zoom as this one. Both were the same price. I finally decided on this camera. I will tell you the reasons I bought this camera, first it has versatility it comes with an adapter for a micro SD card that will expand your camera memory that is awesome for me because I take many shots. Now I will say this I am FAR from a professional photographer. I do however know how to use a camera and I know how to take excellent shots. What some of you people that have put negative reviews on this camera is think about what you are using your camera for if its for pro photography don't buy this camera pay more for an expensive digital SLR. This camera is a point and shoot camera bottom line. I have always bought Olympus cameras and I have never been disappointed with the quality of the products they put out. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone and for the price you can't beat it!", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "C.

Every picture comes out grainy and low resolution. If it was 1996 this would be an okay camera but in the year 2011 this thing is worse than most phone cameras. And don't be confused by the 12.1 MP spec, this thing is like shoving sand in your eyes and then looking at a scenic landscape. It is turely remarkable how bad the quality is. If it was $40 or even $50 then it would be acceptable but at $100 you are better off buying $100 worth of paint supplies and painting a picture yourself", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Image Quality is Beyond \"POOR\"", "Author": "Red Rocket", "ReviewID": "R1AQPZYB174DP0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't waste you money..

I've taken some really beautiful pictures with it.  I've taken hundreds and hundreds, perhaps thousands of mostly flower pics, pics of my three cats, holiday and family get-together's, and church functions. The price is great on this camera.  If you are into professional photography then you need to purchase something else, but, I tell you, I've taken some really nice pictures, once I learned how to use it.  It is not hard to use, but I wouldn't take time to know the product.  I'd like to post some pics on here, but, so far, I can't find where to do that on this website.My suggestion is, if you buy this camera, or any camera for that matter, read all you can about the product. Find out all you can about the different settings. Then go ahead and play around with it by taking pictures using the various settings.  That's the only way you will know if the problem is you or the camera.  I blamed Olympus and said I'd never buy another of this brand.  But once I got serious with finding the \"ins and outs\" of this camera, (which, by the way, was not hard to do and did not take long) I realized the blame was on ME. For instance, I did not know that the little flower on the front left of the \"on\" button is for the Macro setting.  With this setting you can bring out detail in flowers and insects, especially. I didn't know this because I didn't play around with the settings.When you want to take a picture using this Olympus fe46, before you click, and with your object or subject in view, give it a couple seconds and then click.  Not knowing this was how the camera works best, caused me much frustration.  If you do not want to take a couple seconds for the camera to read the scene before you, then please do not purchase this camera.  Amazingly, once I learned this, those two seconds seem like nothing.I had to eat my words when I recently ordered a Olympus SP800UZ.  It is due to arrive tomorrow.  It will be my third Olympus camera. I tried real hard to purchase another brand, but, once I saw the SP800UZ, I knew I had to make it my own. I've been reading everything I can online about the camera so that I can take great pics from the beginning.I would not suggest the Olympus fe46 if you are wanting it specifically to take pictures of your grandson as he plays ball and you want to capture fast movements.  But for flowers, scenes, pets, and people, this is a great camera...and a great price.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Point and Shoot!", "Author": "R.

I am happy with it, but the prices are coming down alot on Camera's everywhere. I just saw a 10 megapixel video camera that also can shoot single shots for $35 the other day.However, this in an Olympus. That says it. If you aren't ready to set the exposure, shutter, and so on - do not buy this camera. The others say it's pretty much point and shoot, then another says it gives poor quality. That's because you can set it for maximum number of pictures or maximum quality. If you haven't bought the extra memory to go in the SD card you are pretty much stuck with less than 1/2 a meg of space which doesn't allow much space for good picture detail in the memory for many shots.I do not like the Macro setting, nor do I want redeye reduction, and setting the flash off or on is going to be a separate button again in the future probably{like it used to be}.But it does shoot amazingly good pictures if you have the time to set it up in advance for your shots. I have photos of a puppy that are so good you can see the tiny little drops of dew in the corner of her eyes. Amazing quality. And a great choice for pictures to post online for selling things. It will do best with back lighting, and outside it does fantastic {just leave the Macro off}.Someday they'll explain why they put some of the other strange settings in this thing, but I love it anyhow.", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "not so good", "Author": "NIKOLOZ BAKRADZE", "ReviewID": "RDPL75X1WR4FM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is not bad thing, but the picture quality...  not so good.for price $96 this buy is a mistake.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "fast and good to click at random stuff...", "Author": "slr2complicated", "ReviewID": "R1AZ96A2I4BI1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This item's the easiest camera u will find in the 12 mp range and it does have too many features for its small price.

Second Problem: The screen has gone blank and will not show anything (occured on a holiday weekend, will speak with them after the weekend), however I still was able to take a picture, as I found out when I removed the SD card and (via an adapter) loaded it to my PC. I would not recommend this product to anyone. You get what you pay for (Retail est $70 USD).When the camera did work, the user controls were confusing to learn as were the camera options. The Macro & Super Macro modes were great when they worked, but when you have to take several pictures to get one that is in focus, it's simply a waste of time. When recording video, the image would not stay in focus no matter how centered the image was in the viewfinder. The Autoflash feature didn't work all of the time, creating problems with night shots. The anti-shaking feature did meet my expectations and worked quite well.
