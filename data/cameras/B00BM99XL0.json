My TX30 was easy to figure out, as it does nearly everything for me automatically!!!I use the highest quality settings possible, and still have room on my 32 gig Micro-SD after using the camera for 4 months and even with recording a bunch of 1080i video.This Sony has done everything I have asked of it, and that is a bunch! I've gotten perfect  horizontal panorama shots of Streetcars and rivers, and really kewl vertical panorama shots of Giant Redwoods (my last camera never could do this.) I gotten terrific underwater shots with tropical fish, fish ponds and even a creek! My high speed video of a Jetboat ride in HD is almost as fun as the day it happed.. We even captured great shots driving past a National Monument (while the Govt. was shut down,) and the quality is awesome.  While this camera does not sport a GPS... I was happy for this, as I located a 'secret' grove of trees and was able to share my pictures without worrying about the secret getting out!!!  I love this TX30, and can't wait for vacation, fall colors, and everything else that comes by my view!!! It is weel worth the price, and I consider myself to me a miser by any normal standards.Thanks for reading!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great underwater picture quality", "Author": "Reiko Amemiya", "ReviewID": "R3F2JXD1LEQMQ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this before we went to Hawaii this summer 2013.  Now it's $30 cheaper than what we paid for!  But it was great buy with all the gears.  Float is not as fancy as we expected but it works just fine.  We took it underwater to take underwater pics, use it on sand, my kids dropped it few times on the sand, and it still works wonderful.  Underwater picture quality is very nice and we are VERY satisfied with this purchase.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great sub-compact point and shoot", "Author": "dnlien", "ReviewID": "R2TKN80NAHXBW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second TX, both are outstanding. They have a ton of options, are small and light enough that my wife likes to carry it with her all the time. Point and shoot, this little guy does the rest. This kit is amazing - it is worth it just to get the extra battery (which we needed in Paris on long day trips). The case will get scratched up a little - and the screen can be tough to see in direct sun - but so is my other most-used camera - my iPhone. This one takes better pictures :)", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Met all my expectations", "Author": "Regis", "ReviewID": "R39FZDOU22YXAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good quality and exactly what I was looking for: compact camera, waterproof (didn't  test yet), light and 100% touch.
