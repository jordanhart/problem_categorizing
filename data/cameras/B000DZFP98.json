I think it has to do with the ultracompact design and how closely the flash and the lens are both tucked into the upper left hand corner. And the white spots remain distracting. This is much worse than with my old camera - overall, I prefer pictures taken with my 4MB Canon powershot S410. I would now rate this camera as merely 2-3 stars.", "Date": "January 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great travel camera", "Author": "Tito \"Yalambi\"", "ReviewID": "R27IOLT9CMY06L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has to be one of the most versatile compact cameras ever.  The 3\" display is awesome. It makes it very easy to frame subject and also for editing & modifying pictures. With this one, I own three digital cameras and by far, this is the most convenient and easy to use. The prompts in the menu are very logical and easy to follow. The movie feature is also awesome. The sound quality is the best I've seen in any camera this size.Very impressed!!!", "Date": "April 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony Cybershot DSC-T50", "Author": "D. J.

It has turned out to be very easy to set up. The touch screen menus work smoothly and intuitively. You can almost throw the manual away unless you want to get really technical. The automatic setting has covered just about anything that I've wanted to do so far. Battery life seems good and I especially like the fact that there is no protruding lens to get broken/jammed. I gave it only four stars  because the last item - durability - has yet to be tested.

We took it skiing with us (Whistler, BC) and it took some outstanding pictures, both of persons and of landscape/scenery. It is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere, anytime. Others may disagree, but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive. Fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed (or better yet, use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers, that doesn't leave any marks on the screen). To summarize: this is an excellent camera, very small size but with a large 3\" LED display, takes EXCELLENT pictures, and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive. Most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it. The only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder, but unless you have very bright sun at your back this isn't too much of a problem.", "Date": "January 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Better color", "Author": "Kikujiro", "ReviewID": "R1RJ26CT336LV4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to have a Canon Powershot.

Pretty slick. That is why there are barely any control buttons on the back. I still went for the T30, Im not fond of pressing on the screen, as well as fear of something else breaking.
