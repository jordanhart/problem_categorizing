The cameras that nightowl provides with their kits are not very good. I would suggest better cameras. I have installed two of these. The Falcon and the Lion. Internet setup is kinda tricky unless you are network savy, but it is not impossible. I would recommend you go to [...] and see if your router is on the list. I have AT&T; DSL with a 2-wire gateway. The instructions that come with the dvr for internet remote acess are really worthless. So if you are not \"network savy\" find someone who is or you could post your router make and model and I would do my best to help you. I am able to see my cameras from every computer in my house and at work or anywhere there is high speed internet. To me that is so cool. I would have given 5 stars except for the cameras. In fact dont spend the extra money and just buy the dvr with no cameras. I have these cameras hooked to my dvr.
