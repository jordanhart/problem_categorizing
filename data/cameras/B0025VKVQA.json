{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera at even a better price!", "Author": "K. Gerlach", "ReviewID": "R2HNF8XUANF1VT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera after doing much research for a trip that I was going to be taking to San Francisco.  Our other camera, a Canon EOS Rebel, is a digital SLR and is too bulky to travel with but we have gotten spoiled by the quick shutter speeds and flexibility of the light conditions.  The t1234 was our answer for all of the conveniences of our SLR but in a small package.  It takes fantastic pictures and the camera actually varies the shutter speed for conditions.  You can leave this to the camera or you can actually set the f-stop, aperture and shutter speed yourself.  There are tons of options on this camera, however, I can see how the everyday shutterbug would find this camera to have too many options for a point and shoot.  This camera blends the cool toys of point and shoots (like stitching together a panoramic) with the functionality of an SLR.  The battery life is amazing too.  I went 5 out of my 6 days snapping photos and still had a 1/4 of my battery left.  My only little gripe is that the power button and play button are too touchy and I find myself accidently turning on the camera in my purse or pocket.  It would have been nice to have a power button lock for those situations.  But hey that is pretty minor for such an awesome camera.  Plus it is an awesome color of green that the pictures don't do justice to.  I hate having my stuff the same old dreary colors as everyone else and this camera catches EVERYONES eye!  I heard more cool green camera during my trip.  I did look at buying the t1235 which is the newer version of this, however, I couldn't justify the +$20 difference for the addition of a touch screen which my OCD would fret over the fingerprints on.  The two menus are easy to navigate and once you tool around 2 or 3 times you quickly become familiar with where everything is and what the options do.  The manual is handy for some of the icons, but you could live without it.  I just keep a digital copy of the manual from Polaroid's website on my computer for quick access.  You definitely won't be disappointed in this camera!", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terribly Disappointed", "Author": "photofreak", "ReviewID": "R1W5EA5ZMFOI9A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I requested this camera for my birthday because of all the wonderful features it offered. It worked well for the first 6 months but now every time I try to turn it on it flashes green, then an amber color and turns off. The battery is brand new and freshly charged. I couldn't figure out the problem and the polaroid support site didn't help. I do not recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible digital Camera!!", "Author": "N. Hilario \"NHil\"", "ReviewID": "RTBWR9OJIPGE9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this nice digital camera for my 13 year old's birthday last April and am now very disappointed with my purchase. The camera is now (not even after ONLY 4 months of use!) causing the camera to not properly shut down and the lens seems to be permanently stuck. Of course, she is disappointed and so am I. I will never purchase another POLAROID camera again EVER. I am still hoping that their Tech supoort can help and maybe even offer a refund or a new camera.PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DIGITAL CAMERA FOR YOUR KIDS!!", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Greatest Camera", "Author": "Ann M.

It is easy to operate and takes great pictures she takes it everywhere she goes.  Did a lot of research before purchasing for her and we made the right choice.

I absolutly do NOT reccommend this camera and if you think Polaroid support will help you are wrong. We returned it to Polaroid after it quit working in August, it is now December and we still have no camera. They say they are back-logged with complaints on this camera due to all of them being defective. I have called numerous times and get no where.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty good camera for price.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1T8XOAQBOWI9O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the pink version of this camera about 6 months ago.  This camera is very decent (given the price). The only thing that I noticed is that it's a little slow to respond ( when you are turning it off or turning it on).  The second thing I noticed is the following: When you are taking a video, the sound stops working when you zoom in and out to focus on what you are shooting... but the sound resumes once you are done focusing. Other than that, this camera is great and super stylish.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "awesome camera", "Author": "Jez.", "ReviewID": "R3GVUH91UP33BY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about five months ago, It works really fine, the green color is amazing, 12 MP is more than enough, the best thing about it is the anti-hand-shaking feature, I love the camera, it does what it is supposed to so far, buttons are easy to use, many options in the software, though I hope it was a tough screen but it is okay anyways. Its video is good too. It is an awesome camera.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great starter Camera", "Author": "Michelle N", "ReviewID": "R2INJ9BKC4QNVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered this for my 11 year old after returning a different one that turned out to be a piece of junk.  This Camera is simple to use, but takes great pictures for an inexpensive camera.

However, because the case is made of aluminum, it can be damaged easily.  It does not take much of a hit to dent and disable it from working.  It happened to me on the golf course.  I had the Polaroid in my left pocket after I took some picture.  As I sat down in the golf card the camera hit the arm rail causing a minor dent in the frame but enough to cause the camera to stop working. Actually it still takes picture but the 3.0\" display does not show them.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Polaroid 12.0 Megapixel  Digital Camera", "Author": "C.

Was suppose to come with a year warranty so I got ahold of Polaroid and was told they could not help me because the company that I bought this from was not a Polaroid registered company. Amazon would not help because it was longer than ninety days. Contacted this company several times they were no help and eventually stop responding to my requests. Long story short I through away almost a hundred dollars. The repair would of cost me more than the camera was worth. Beware of this company and this camera!!!!! Also very disappointed in Amazon. I have bought many many things through Amazon and was very disappointed with there response to my problem.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Legal Asst \"LegalAsst\"", "ReviewID": "RCTU27K1QV98G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was a gift for someone else, so I can't provide much of a review.Thank you.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0025VKVQA"}}
