Andrews", "ReviewID": "R1IR96VQRE9EC2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love everything about this camera, except.... it takes a terrible picture.The good:  The form factor is great  I like the way you slide the cover to open the lens and turn the camera on.  Makes turning on fast and easy.  The touch screen is great.  Very easy to change settings.  Screen is responsive. You can touch where you want to focus, which is really cool.  The ability to shoot in 16:9 ratio is nice, but you're limited to 8MP in that mode.The Bad  This camera just wouldn't take a good picture.  Outside in daylight I could get a pretty good photo, but anything indoors was poor at best.  Even indoors during the day when there's decent light.  After taking my first set of shots I assumed I must be doing something wrong, so I read the manual, tried all the different \"scenes\", I tried adjusting ISO, resolution, etc.Granted, I'm a fairly novice user, so perhaps a more experienced pro could get a better picture out of this camera.  I finally pulled out my old Canon SD200 3.2MP camera that I was looking to replace.  I took many photos side by side.  I never took the Canon off \"auto\" mode and I tweaked the Nikon a million ways.  Virtually every time the Canon was sharper, and more color accurate.So, I thouht maybe I got a bad camera.  I went to Best Buy and tried their display model.  You could see on the camera screen that the images just weren't that great. Maybe if I didn't have a side by side comparison it wouldn't have been so noticable, but I really expected this Nikon to be better than my very old Canon.If anyone believes it's the operator and not the camera I'm more than open to advice, because I loved everything else about this camera.  I did return it, but would buy it again if I found out it was just operator error, however, I really don't think it was my error.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Come on Nikon!!", "Author": "M.

Like most Nikon cameras I have owned, it functioned perfectly right out of the box. Having been highly disappointed with the previous S60, this new S70 seems to have corrected all of the shortcomings of the S60 and much more. The new OLED touch screen is a joy to use - sensitive and responsive. The screen visibility and clarity is excellent under all lighting conditions. Nikon also substituted a more robust battery which in combination with the OLED panel should extend camera use between charges. Perhaps more important is the clarity and sharpness of the images taken with the S70. They are impressively sharp and clear under magnification. The menus are intuitive and easy to navigate. The touch screen focus and shutter release function is a nice touch. The simplified and enhanced in-camera cropping and retouch functions are well done and welcome additions. The Easy Auto mode handles very well all of the major camera settings and functions required for a good picture when a quick \"point & shoot\" situation arises. I would have preferred however an out-of-camera battery recharging system as I usually charge and carry a spare battery. I will be purchasing an external charger.I have owned Nikon film and digital cameras for the last 25 years and I consider my new S70 to be a very worthwhile addition. It is stylish, functional, fun to use, and takes great photos. When you need a high quality pocket sized camera, you should take a close look at this one.

The problem, as stated in another review, is that the image sensor does not do well with high ISOs.  I find that setting it to max out at around 800 yields the best photos.  The VR zoom is a huge benefit to keep photos in focus.  I recommend using a fast memory card to reduce (and eliminate) shutter lag.The only drawback is the touchscreen in the back.  When I first started using the camera I found myself touching it inadvertantly and doing things I didn't intend.  With a small amount of experience with the camera I don't do that anymore and I have learned where to put my fingers to avoid the touchscreen.  The screen itself is beautiful - among the very best I have seen on a camera back (I suspect it is similar to the one I have on my D3000 Nikon SLR - although that isn't a touch screen).  The touch sensitivity cannot be altered (as far as I can tell), so it still poses an issue when I you hand the camera to someone else to take a photo.Overall, I really like the camera and it takes nice photos when set correctly.  The touchscreen and lack of quality high ISO result in the deduction of one star - I would probably have given 3 1/2 if I could, but the high quality of Nikon products generally biases me towards rounding up, not down.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Big problems", "Author": "Sandy \"bocagal\"", "ReviewID": "R2G4HGJQZQEE7E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The features are great, the design of the touch screen is clever, but if you default to the touch screen, it is way too easy to mistakenly touch the screen and take photos you don't want.

Lopez \"California Groovin\"", "ReviewID": "R3F7DOG94TTC0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have not tried the S70 yet (so disregard star rating) but I have noticed several reviews with frustrations about poor image quality. I also saw in the CNET Editor's review that they suggested that the user sets the Auto ISO limit to 80-200 for best results in most conditions and 80-400 max under difficult lighting conditions. Anyone who is experiencing photo quality issues might want to try that to see if it makes a big improvement. I expect that it will make a big difference since CNET said the pictures were \"very good for a snapshot camera\" once those settings have been changed. My guess is for some reason the camera is trying to use a ridiculously high ISO setting (1200-6400) and producing predictably grainier photos as a result. As Wikipedia explains regarding ISO speeds, \"In both digital and film photography, the reduction of exposure corresponding to use of higher [ISO] sensitivities generally leads to reduced image quality (via coarser film grain or higher image noise of other types).\" If that is in fact the problem it would still be a design flaw but one with perhaps a simple and very tolerable workaround.From CNET:\"The photo quality from the S70 is very good for a snapshot camera...The camera lets you limit the auto ISO range to either 80-200 or 80-400. If you're in daylight or bright conditions, I recommend locking it down to 80-200. Again, it did perform well through ISO 400, but it's at its best below ISO 200.\"Good luck with that workaround.Also, anyone who has problems tapping the screen by accident should probably set the camera to only use the shutter button.I still like the specs of this camera so plan to check it out at the local Best Buy with my own SD card and I will be playing with these settings and I will update my review once I have.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fine camera", "Author": "P.

As a disclaimer, I should mention that I am a professional photographer and have been since the mid-70s. I know what shutter speeds and F stops are and how they can affect image quality and final look.I do not agree with the reviewers that talk about poor image quality, I do agree with the ones that suggest you learn how to use the camera. It is true that in low light situations, the camera is not always accurate with it's touch screen auto focus. I have found that using the shutter release instead totally solves that problem. I've also taken a few shots of my thumb because of the lens placement, but hey, they were sharp and well exposed.The iPod-like viewing of the photos on the screen with the swipe action is brilliant. I've been using it in my business as my \"Polaroid\" shots to quickly show clients camera angles without them messing with my other equipment. I'm also involved in a construction project now and the camera has been great to create my punch list, way better than writing everything down.I'm not too crazy about the in-camera charging of the battery, so I purchased another battery and external charger; always a good idea anyway.I first looked at the S70 as a toy to just have some fun with, but I have been completely satisfied with this camera and find myself putting it in my pocket whenever I leave the house.

I spent a few hours analyzing the results and overall I am very well pleased with this camera (replaced the Nikon S51.) I've owned many digital cameras going back into the 1990's when they were sub-megapixel, so I am no stranger to strange behavior in any particular model.With the S70, the confusion seems to come with 2 different Auto modes: Auto (Easy) and Auto. When using the \"easy\" Auto mode, the camera makes scene mode decisions for the user and I found results in this mode to be lower-than-expected and on par with many of the negative comments posted. When switched to Auto mode with forced fill-in flash, the camera performed very well in every situation and the picture detail and tonal quality were excellent and the digital 'noise' and artifacts were minimized. Obviously, you can continue to customize the workings of the unit to fine-tune performance and quality as some other reviewers have suggested; but this is a point-n-shoot camera, so over customization will require you to re-tune when shooting in other modes.You are not required to touch the screen to release the shutter; a conventional shutter release button is available.I have not yet taken it outside for action shots and landscapes, but other reviewers have comments in this area.As far as the touch screen is concerned, it takes a little getting used to... some will love it and some will hate it... same as the iPhone love/hate relationship. If you purchase this camera, give yourself the opportunity to fully explore the touch screen over time and my belief is that you will not be disappointed. If you do not like the thought of touching the screen for all the settings and functions, stay away from this model.I plan on buying another one as a graduation gift; the iTouch group immediately fall in love with this unit.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor Pictures.

Not wanting to lug along a large format camera, I thought the Nikon S70 would be the perfect size. Besides, what better brand to purchase than a Nikon? Unfortunately, it proved to be an exceptionally poor camera. Had I read the reviews posted on amazon.com prior to purchasing the camera, I would have chosen something else.  Being a somewhat experienced photographer, I thought I could make good use of the Nikon S70, despite the negative reviews. Of the 1000+ photos I took, more than 75% were fuzzy, out of focus, poorly lighted, or had to be deleted. It was a once-in-a-lifetime trip and I'd hoped to come home with some good photographic memories. Needless to say, I was greatly disappointed. I've returned the camera to amazon.com. While the size of the camera was what I was expecting, the sensitivity of the touch screen and certain other features force you handle the camera with great care to prevent changing various settings or accidentally taking an unwanted photo. The lack of sharp focus was the worst issue with the camera. It seemed confused under certain lighting conditions. Apparently Nikon has discontinued this particular model, which is a good decision.

I read all the reviews and most had the same theme...fun camera, loved the touch-screen but didn't take quality pictures.  I threw caution into the wind and ignored the negative.

I should add that it did take some clear pictures but if I had to assign a percentage I would say 80% of the picture were blurry.  I read every review on how to adjust the ISO & everything else.  I even took it to my buddy the camera tech geek.  He had no luck in getting consistent quality pictures either.  He said the camera was just \"too gimicky.\"  I took the camera out New Years Eve and out of the 20 or 30 pics we took...only 3 were good quality (very dissapointing).  So while I loved the camera for it's options, size & touch-screen...it just didn't take consistent quality pictures.I have since returned the camera and purchased a Cannon elph (dont remember the exact name or model).  All I want is a small portable camera that takes reasonably good quality pictures.  I don't know much about camera's at all and don't really want too...just want to shoot & view, print and most importantly capture memories.

The odds would appear to certainly not be in my favor.  At least one of these according to all the reviews should be a piece of crap camera - if not both.Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  I did review the manual before using to familiarize myself with the controls - maybe that was a mistake.  I also don't judge quality by the camera screen - instead I download to my computer.  That could be the problem there you think?  I don't use the manual controls very often - mostly just the auto modes with the occasional selection of a specific scene to match the conditions.

I have taken some scenic outdoor shots that compare to more expensive cameras that I own. The lens is not terribly fast at F3.9 & the flash is not very powerful so indoors it can be more challenging. I actually found that the \"Easy Auto\" setting which analyzes the shot you are taking and picks the best combination of ISO, aperture and shutter speed works best! This camera is also not meant to be fast as far as shot to shot time, so you would not want to use it to follow fast moving subjects, although I did \"pan\" around and chased down a squirrel with no blur. The camera also has a \"WOW\" factor with the touchscreen & touch shutter. In fact the camera is devoid of buttons except the shutter release which you only have to use once you are in the digital zoom range. As someone who enjoys cameras this was not a necessary purchase, but it is a blast to use, it's built extremely well and is fun to use. Lastly as the old saying goes, \"the best camera is the one you have with you\". I carry this with me most of the time and with a quick slide of the lens cover, the camera powers up very fast and bang, I have captured an image I might not have gotten if A)I did not have a camera with me or B)Had to put my camera in the correct shooting mode & fiddle with settings. There is a niche for a camera like this and even if you are a camera snob or serious photographer, you can still have fun taking photos with a forward thinking, unique camera.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible Camera", "Author": "C.

I have had nikon cameras since the 60\"s and always felt the name Nikon stood for quality; not anymore. With the wide array of picture quality reviews and problems, I have to guess that the demand was so great for this now cool camera, that they outsourced its manufacture to some of those companies that make stuff to fill the 99cents stores.

Nikon never again.Update-4/29 has come and gone and no part arrived. I called last evening and was told by Gabriel (who is in the Dominican Republic) that the part has still not arrived. How can anyone believe this. The camera was received by them 4/10 and 2 days later the status was b1 which is needs minor repair, and it was put on parts hold. An e-mail I received this a.m 4/4 says the parts will not arrive for another 10 days which will make 5 weeks on parts hold. This particular model is a lemon.

I set the camera on the ground with the lens side downward, touched the screen to focus where I wanted, & let the camera take the picture.

I paid $279 new for a black one. I feel it was worth every penny, but I do find it annoying that you can buy a new one today for half that. Buy it, if your looking for that kind of advice. I bought the S70 because I finally admitted to myself that I was never going to take the time, nor did I have an interest in, learning to use all the complicated features on my 'nice but not for amateurs'  Minolta SLR digital, which was big, expensive, and always set on auto anyway. I was attracted to S70 for the style, slim size (think deck of cards), and the idea it had only one button and the large display (the entire back) as viewfinder, (that's it by the way, there is no little hole to peer through), playback, touchscreen functions, etc.  Simple. I bought a cool leather case so that I can wear it on my belt, and have carried it every day since I got it . I have read the bad reviews about this camera, and I have experienced all of the problems others have encountered. Learning to set the ISO properly, whatever that is, is the key. Lower is better. The plus of the large viewing area in playback, becomes a pain when taking photos or videos, as it is ridiculously  easy to inadvertently take pictures or stop. But it's no problem deleting them, and having bought the largest (16GB, the camera won't take a 32GB ) memory card, I have never come close to filling it up. I have 1100+ pictures, and about twenty or thirty minutes of video stored on the card so far, and it tells me I still have room for 1000+ more. When I choose to upload to a computer, it's no problem.  I have taken pictures that are sharp, bright and clear, filling up the entire computer screen with stunning clarity. So I know it can do that. There are a couple of reviews on here by professional photographers that use this as kind of a 'Polaroid' to demo angles, lighting and such. They gave five stars. Both commented on the ISO setting.

My father is an \"early adopter\" type and was interested in all of the advertised features.  In short, the camera has been a total nightmare. When you try to take a photo, whether you are using the touch screen or the more traditional button at the top of the camera, there is a 3-4 second delay between the moment you \"click\" and the moment when the actual photo is taken.  Consequently, subjects move, your hand jiggles, etc.  About 3 out of 4 of my photos are blurry and have to be discarded.

This is a questionable practice as the pressure to take the photo will cause movement that even the best vibration technique cannot over come.  Instant solution.  Use the \"button\" on top.2.  Failing to allow camera to focus - wait for the green brackets, then continue to press the shutter button down.  I have found from empirical evidence that many will press part way, the camera focuses, then they instantly release the button and press it again - many times totally unaware they are doing that.  Solution - press part way, allow the camera to focus then continue to press to release the shutter.  Your care in this process will result in excellent photographs.3.  Picture quality.  Unless you need a high ISO, use ISO under 200.  Anything above that will result in excessive noise.  Note, there is software available that can remove much of the camera noise which appears as black and gray specs in the image.4.  Remember, this is NOT a DSLR.

At first I was a bit disappointed by the picture quality but as I played with the settings I learned how to manipulate the camera in different lighting, setting , and subject.  A lot of reviews blasted the picture quality, but a camera is as good as the photographer behind it. The camera won't turn out amazing pictures just because it is a nice camera.  It is not that easy to use and it takes time to set up a picture.  I was really happy with the camera until my internal zoom malfunctioned and caused everything to be blurry. I sent it to Nikon to get repaired and they are working on it now. I bought the camera when it came out, about full price and I am ashamed to see the price drop so much.  When I questioned Nikon about it they said they were not allowed to divulge that information.  It seems that this camera has a defect and a lot of reviews I found have the touch screen stop working.  I still love the camera since it does what I wanted it to do.. take quick pictures and is compact.  I am just disappoined in Nikon for not working out the issues before they put it on the market.

I also saw in the CNET Editor's review that they suggested that the user sets the Auto ISO limit to 80-200 for best results in most conditions and 80-400 max under difficult lighting conditions. So anyone who is experiencing photo quality issues might want to try that to see if it has a dramatic improvement. CNET said the pictures were \"very good for a snapshot camera\" once those settings have been changed. My guess is for some reason the camera is trying to take a ridiculously high ISO (1200-6400) and producing grainier photos as a result. As Wikipedia explains regarding ISO speeds, \"In both digital and film photography, the reduction of exposure corresponding to use of higher sensitivities generally leads to reduced image quality (via coarser film grain or higher image noise of other types).\" If that is in fact the problem it would still be a design flaw but one with perhaps a simple and tolerable workaround.From the CNET S70 review:\"The photo quality from the S70 is very good for a snapshot camera...The camera lets you limit the auto ISO range to either 80-200 or 80-400. If you're in daylight or bright conditions, I recommend locking it down to 80-200. Again, it did perform well through ISO 400, but it's at its best below ISO 200.\"[...]Good luck with that workaround.I still like the specs of this camera so plan to check it out at the local Best Buy with my own SD card and I will be playing with these settings and I will update my review once I have.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Stay away!", "Author": "Robert Swanson", "ReviewID": "R1OCHF0GO7LYQI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well, reading the reviews should be enough to confuse anyone about the camera. Many people share the same story, that it has been difficult or impossible to get good pictures from this camera. Others declare that they are well pleased with the quality of the photos. One thing for sure, the experiences with the camera are not universal. It's important to note that none of these are professional cameras. They are meant to be a simple to use camera, that produces a good picture. If I hired a professional photograher and he showed up with a compact, I'd fire him on the spot. That said, this is my second CoolPix. The first one, an S60, was purchased in July 09, and works like a champ. It was replacing an ancient Sony Cybershot 3.2 MP that has always worked well. The S60 produces very clear pictures that you can zoom in on or enlarge and still looks clear. It has a variety of easy to use advanced options that allow a more knowledgeable photographer flexibility and creativity. In November I purchased the S70 for use at work. The S70 shares these features, but not the picture quality. Originally, when we discovered how poor the pictures looked, we thought there must have been some setting that needed changed. I guessed that perhaps it was in a minimal dpi setting for email sized photos. Not so. No amount of experimenting could improve it. On the highest resolution setting, photos come out grainy and blurry. No amount of Photoshopping makes the pictures good. I have joked that they put the decimal in the wrong place, that it should be 1.2 Megapixel. Honestly, the 3.2 MP camera on my phone takes much better pictures.It's hard to say why there is such disparity in the reviews. Some certainly is user opinion or experience level. I think it is likely that the cameras are inconsistent from the factory. Perhaps some are manufactured at different facilities or different product runs had different internal components.

Previous to this camera, I had an older coolpix that stopped working a few years ago.  During those few years I had been using cheap disposable cameras.  I couldn't wait to have a \"real\" camera again.  I had planned to use the camera for just my regular family pics. I paid almost $400 for this camera, and this was the most expensive camera I had ever bought.  However, I was never able to take a decent picture.  I would have to take several before I would get one decent picture.  I could take back-to-back pictures and one would be so bright that it was \"whited out\" and the next one be so dark it was \"blacked out\".  Also pretty much all of the pictures came out blurry.  Even the pictures that weren't blurry were not crisp and clear.  Coming from using cheap disposables for a few years, I figured surely I would be impressed with a $400 camera.  Unfortunately, I am back to using disposables!  I just recently had a new baby, and I took several disposables to the hospital with me because I knew I couldn't depend on the coolpix s70 to produce any quality pictures.  I read the manuel and readjusted settings, researched the internet for advice on improving the picture taking quality, and called the manufacturer for advice...nothing worked!  I even asked a very techy camera guru friend of mine to please play with the camera for me to see if it was just me.  We came to the conclusion that \"it is impossible to take a good picture with this camera\"!  My friends and family who have tried to use the camera at gatherings have also commented to me how poor the picture quality is and several have complained the camera is hard to use.

Outside as hard to see in bright light as cell phone monitor.  Hard to manipulate camera without getting finger in way of lens or accidentally pressing shutter-release button while focusing.  Also needs frequent cleaning, since monitor gets smeared with fingerprints from handling camera. The \"big\" monitor might sound good, but big does not necessarily mean better.  I prefer the traditional viewfinder.Furthermore, my Coolpix is six months old, and the monitor developed a green tinge in upper left hand corner so when viewing images they are tinged green in that area.  This discoloration is not there in images uploaded to computer.  I found in the manual under Notes On the Monitor:  OLED monitors are susceptible to screen burn.  I don't know if that is what the green tinge is but may be.  The monitor is my main complaint.

This was not easy to avoid even once I knew it was an issue.  I ended up returning this and purchasing a Nikon S4100, which I would highly recommend.

Gubar \"Sports Car Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R36O0ODQXDGQ4S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera isn't of the quality that Nikon is known for.There are some positives going for it:1. Size: it's small enough to put into either a shirt pocket or pants pocket.  Great to carry around for those occasions when you want to have a camera handy.2. Lens Cover:  Unlike some of the other CoolPix cameras, this one has a cover for the lens.  That might not seem like a big deal, but after having a scratched lens from other things in your pocket, it's helpful.3. Rapid On and Off:  Sometimes you just don't have the time to wait for the camera to slowly turn on or off, or have an available flash.  This camera has a rapid on/off cycle.Cons:1. Picture Quality:  Probably the most important thing that should be considered when buying any camera is picture quality.  The pictures produced by the S70 seems to be grainy whether day or night, using either the telephoto or wide angle functions. Changing the resolution didn't help with the grainy photographs.2. Touch Screen:  While a nice touch (no pun intended), it can be difficult to use. In colder weather, the touch screen isn't as responsive as necessary (Touch the screen to activate the shutter). There can be quite a lag in the time between touching the screen and the shutter going off. Don't expect to get a quick response in winter.3. Slow Speed: Great for posed photos, but for any sort of faster action, most of the pictures are blurry. Again, the speed of the shutter on the CoolPix S70 is great for candid party shots or snaps of buildings or other landmarks while on vacation, but not for sporting events.Bottom Line:While the CoolPix S70 is compact and handy, the quality of the pictures produced are not very good.  To be perfectly candid (again, no pun intended), other than the Nikon name, there really isn't anything here that deserves the moniker.  Smartphone cameras (I have an iPhone 3GS), have the same quality. If you're looking for a cheap camera with the Nikon name, this is it.  Unfortunately, the CoolPix S70, was a good concept that just didn't work.  There are lots of bells and whistles, but the bottom line is the resulting photograph. If you'd like a small camera to take mediocre photos, stick to the cellphone camera.  If you are looking for a better quality, either invest more in a better camera, or look to another brand.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "what a bad piece of junk", "Author": "Mar \"Marinera\"", "ReviewID": "R3KZ8S7LKUU4O3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "horrible, this camera is horrible, takes bad pictures, come out very bad, i change settings, i did everything to like it., but its the wrost camera i have had.the only thing was the 3.5 inch lcd, but i cant believe people like this camera.its slow, blurry pics, what a waist of money. return back. my 4 year little boys spider man camera does a better job .", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "alright camera", "Author": "squeege", "ReviewID": "RAT93880SANXK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera constantly creates picture with dots all over, I think due to the fact that the from lens gets dirty too easily.

I liked all the features it had to offer, but every feature did not work properly.  This camera is inherently flawed.  For every pro there is a con.  I did not want to believe the negative reviews on amazon, but I wish I had.  I ultimately had to return it because it just simply does not work as advertised.Pro (with it's con)- big OLED touchscreen.  ( that's awesome, but the resolution is so poor, it really is an eyesore to look at.  Colors look nice, but they do not truly represent the photo when transferred to a computer)- touch controls, virtually no buttons except the shutter. Controls include iPhone like pinch to zoom and swiping through picture functionality. (this feature would be nice had they either put better hardware in the camera or made the firmware more efficient.  The controls are so slow and unresponsive, it will make you downright mad.  Touch focus is horrific and never works as it is supposed to.  Also, no dedicated power button means you must open the lens up to turn it on, even to review pictures.  Come on, that's ridiculous.)-high resolution sensor capable of taking HD 720p video. (I should live with the afformemtioned flaws above, but it must do it's primary function well, taking a nice clear picture.  This camera does not.  The pictures look simply bad.  My 5 year old Sanyo Xacti digicam takes superior pictures to this camera.  This is not an exaggeration.  Pictures are not properly set up by the camera, and are often taken incorrectly.  Previewing the pictures on the camera show rich vibrant color, but transferring them to a computer show them to be dull, with improper color representation.  Video is no better.  It looks to be captured via motion jpeg format.  Framerates are bad, colors look as dull and misrepresented as in stills.  Also, no optical zoom while shooting video.  Just everything wrong going on here.)A few nice things that I really can't complain about is the build quality is superb.  Also, the all interenal optics is great so if you are storing it in a purse or pocket, the lens will not protrude accidentally causing harm to the camera. This cannot make up for the fact that a) it's primary function, taking pictures is severly flawed, and b) Its main selling point, the huge multitouch OLED display looks horrific and does not Function properly.I honestly cannot recommend this item, and would recommend a comparable camera from another manufacturer.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible!

I also saw in the CNET Editor's review that they suggested that the user sets the Auto ISO limit to 80-200 for best results in most conditions and 80-400 max under difficult lighting conditions. So anyone who is experiencing photo quality issues might want to try that to see if it has a dramatic improvement. CNET said the pictures were \"very good for a snapshot camera\" once those settings have been changed. My guess is for some reason the camera is trying to take a ridiculously high ISO (1200-6400) and producing grainier photos as a result. As Wikipedia explains regarding ISO speeds, \"In both digital and film photography, the reduction of exposure corresponding to use of higher sensitivities generally leads to reduced image quality (via coarser film grain or higher image noise of other types).\" If that is in fact the problem it would still be a design flaw but one with perhaps a simple and tolerable workaround.[...]\"The photo quality from the S70 is very good for a snapshot camera...The camera lets you limit the auto ISO range to either 80-200 or 80-400.

I realize that some of this had to do with the settings and the fact that it was difficult to remember to change the settings for each shot.Another problem had to do with the touch screen. It was almost impossible to take a picture without touching one of the icons on the screen. In some cases the picture taking process was reduced to listening to the camera constantly changing some button or other. Reviews had mentioned this but I just thought that people needed to be more careful. It's almost impossible to be careful with this camera.

Ramsey", "ReviewID": "R38NQ5VH9NMWUD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nikon has some of the best optics around and has for many years.  I also have a digital SLR that was actually less expensive than this S-70.I mainly bought the S-70 for my wife's convenience and lack of tech skills.  Simple aim and shoot with some cool features to review pics and videos.  I also liked the idea of a compact for family events instead of lugging around my SLR all of the time.Nothing could be further from the truth with this camera.  Out of the box, without very good documentation either in softcover or online, it's a bit daunting to figure out all of the symbols without a lot of trial and error on the users part.  You would think the UI would atleast be friendly, however after being lead continuously down the path of dead-end menu structures with no real way to go 'back' to the previous menu, you tend to take the short cut of closing the camera to reset the menu so you can start over.Sound fun?  Wait, there's more!I figured, oh well, atleast there's the super simple mode, tap the simpleton icon, aim and ... tap ... tap ... tap.  The response time of tapping the screen or even using the shutter release button to take a picture is so slow and sometimes unresponsive that your friends and family are already looking at you like, \"Will you hurry the %$*! up so I can get back to what I was doing before.\" \"You paid what?!? for that piece of ...\"  You get the 'picture'.I don't remember quality being a significant point in the commercials and it's a good thing.  With all the anti-motion and such, I am amazed at how much you have to make absolutely sure you're not even breathing when you take a shot.  Close to 9 out of 10 pics come out blurred because your heart beat more than 10 times during the extruciatingly slow electronic shutter release.  And forget low light or even night shots.  Those not only are mostly blurred due to the even slower response to capture more light, but the color quality and flash deciding whether or not to make up it's mind and actually flash is so inconsistant and spotty you and your audience are just hoping this thing will take a decent photo over the last 10 tries so everyone can get on with their life as this camera sucks the fun out of the trying to capture a 'Kodak' moment.And UI to Nikon must stand for Unsightly Icons.  There are more icons on the screen than picture.  And one out of the 2 dozen or so blocking your view actually reduces them by half!  How convenient!  Good luck on finding the one that does that!Well, atleast it's built well, right?  I hope the cheap plastic lens cover that slides in an incovenient way as to make you fumble for a bit to get it open, lasts for a year.  All other Nikon products I've ever had were built superior to most other mfg's, but so is the price.  It's suprising they would even consider putting this product to market, except for  the fact they are trying to greedily capture the 'instamatic' audience they really have no business to be bothering.Next time I really want to shell out some money for a camera, I sure won't be buying sight unseen through the internet. (My bad)  I suggest you go to your local retail camera outlet, try a dozen or so with the helpful guy trying to sell you at MSRP, and choose the one that fits you and your perception of quality, and then buy it on the internet with someone who will take it back due to purely your dissatisfaction of the product.I doubt Ashton Kutcher really ever used it.  And have you noticed he's hawking their digital SLR lately?Save yourself from frustration and dissappointment and pass on this Nikon camera.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "What happened, Nikon?!?", "Author": "julia goolia", "ReviewID": "R2CRYPMLM292K5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been a coolpix fan for years.  However, my last two attempts to upgrade from my S51 have been incredibly disappointing.  This is a nice little camera with a great interface, but the picture quality is really bad.  I had the same experience with the S60.  In both cases, I took pictures with the new coolpix and with my S51, and then compared them on the computer to be sure all the photo settings were exactly the same.  The difference in photo quality is undeniable.  The S70 is getting returned.Note:  For some reason, Amazon is listing different reviews for the different colors of this camera.
