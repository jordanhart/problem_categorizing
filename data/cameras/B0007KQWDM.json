If you take a picture with a flash it will take about 2-3 seconds to write to the memory card, then the screen will turn off while the flash recharges for another 5-8 seconds.  Too many people here glossed over that particular fact and it's really a deal breaker, because for the same price you can buy a Canon elph, one of their S series cameras like the SD200 and the picture quality is better, it uses rechargable batteries not AA's and it doesn't have this ridiculous flash lag.  The flash lag on this nikon 4600 is totally unacceptable, if you add up the numbers you're looking at 7-11 seconds per picture, and if you choose not to use the flash then you won't have a usable picture, because the picture won't come out dark it will come out blurry, which makes no sense but that's what happens.  This camera was a gift and I feel bad i gave it to someone, my regular camera is a Kodak DX7440 and it shoots pictures instantaneously with no flash lag it costs about 50 dollars more.", "Date": "June 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Delay and photo quality are real problems", "Author": "TracyQ", "ReviewID": "R6TMRZHRJ1PF4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I researched cameras and found fairly good reviews for this one, but I soon discovered that I would have been better off with my old 1 MP Kodak.  The flash is weak and I have to lighten nearly all indoor photos.  As others have mentioned, this camera has a long recycle time between photos and you do miss a lot of photos.  I also have a problem with the quality of the photos; a lot of them are slightly blurry and I have to use my photo editing software to sharpen them.  Everyone once in a while, the camera seems to decide that it's had enough and just stops.  I have to move the dial to a different setting and then back to the regular setting so that it will work again.

I bought it only after doing a lot of research and reading a lot of interviews and the reviews were all just stellar.  No one mentioned any drawbacks!  Well the buyer needs to know a few things about this camera.  First of all, I will say that it can take good pictures and it is of a very handy size (maybe even too small).  But there is one very big draw back to this camera: it takes a very, very long time to take a picture.  Now I'm not just talking about flash photography here, which, as one other reviewer recently mentioned, is extremely slow (10 or 11 seconds between pictures) due to the slow write and recharge times.  The slowness I am talking about is for normal everyday (non-flash) photos and this camera takes a very long (read that as unacceptable) time to focus and take a picture.  I have missed so many good pictures waiting for this camera to focus and actually take the photo that I would recommend that you seriously look at other alternatives prior to buying this camera.  I regret buying this camera and giving it to a close friend prior to actually using it myself and determining that it had these problems.  I will say that it can take beautiful pictures and even half decent video clips (with no sound) but what you are taking a picture of better be \"still life\" in nature and you better not be in a hurry to take it.  Please note that I am not a Nikon basher as I have a Nikon D-100 digital SLR and it is the best camera in the world.  Of course it cost about $1,000 but it was worth every penny.  Just think very carefully before buying a Nikon 4600.", "Date": "November 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "Comments from a novice to digital photography", "Author": "Irwin Munt \"irwinm2\"", "ReviewID": "RVWZLVDS28ARC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera after many years of analog photography.  I learned to take pictures on a Bolsey B2.  This was a 35 mm that was fully manual.  The camera may deserve 5 stars, but I do not have a frame of reference to do this.  I do not value real small cameras, but I accept that I cannot fight the popular market demands.I found it very easy to get started taking pictures.  I am working my way through the manual.  The manual is really brief, but complete and understandable.  While there is an automatic mode, one can get best performance by selecting shooting situations from menus.  While I have purchased, and plan to use rechargeable batteries, I appreciated the fact that the disposable alkalines held up while I went through my early learning phases.The software that came with the camera offered some brightness and color control in addition to more basic editing features.  It is easy to work with.  Again, I lack the experience to be critical.I realize that experienced digital enthusiasts may want to skip this review, but I hope to encourage other novices to give this camera very serious consideration.  The literature is very clear and easy to follow (if you have good eyesight or a magnifier).", "Date": "April 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "So so......", "Author": "T.  Coldstone", "ReviewID": "R34DA5TSZXKT4B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is very small and compact, so it can fit into any bag, but this is also something that could become a bit of a hinderance or even a downright frustration to people with larger hands.  The buttons are small and can be difficult to press, and the aesthetics can be a bit unnatural.  It may not feel right or natural when holding it in your hand because of the small size.  It is very slick to the eye, and it takes quality 4 megapixel photos.Although the quality of the pictures is very impressive (when uploading the pictures on the computer, I found the detail to be amazing), the speed of the camera is very slow and pictures tend to come out blurry without the use of a flash, two things that I found very frustrating when trying to take pictures at a family member's wedding.  You could imagine my frustration when I was at my cousin's wedding, a once in a lifetime event, and I was prohibited from using flash.  I had to take the pictures without using the flash and every single one indoors came out blurry, so right into the trash can it went.  I went through their entire wedding without getting one useful photo except when I got outside.  Outside, flash is not necessary and you can take good pictures then without it.On a different note, the flash is incredibly powerful (just use it wisely because after you take one picture with flash, you won't be taking another for a good ten seconds or so, more on this later), in complete darkness, I was able to take a picture with accurate colors, a picture so good that people I showed it to didn't even know it was taken in pitch black darkness.Once we got to the wedding reception, I was allowed to use flash, finally, I could get some decent pictures.  When taking pictures with the flash, the actual light flash occurs for a good five or so seconds, and flashes several times, it is a very obvious flash, one that actually embarrassed me during the wedding when I couldn't use flash and thought it was turned off, but it wasn't.  That leads me to another note, when I turned the flash to off, it seemed to stay that way for one picture, then for the next, it seemed to go back to auto, turning the flash on when I didn't want it on.Besides the five or so second flash delay, there is another delay after you take the picture.  The screen goes black for about eight or more seconds, (HIGHLY FRUSTRATING when you're trying to capture once in a lifetime moments, of course the perfect photo opt occurs during the camera's downtime which appears to be forever!) then you have to switch to the playback mode to preview the picture, yet another delay.  At this rate, you can capture only two or three flash pictures (the flash is absolutely necessary unless you are outdoors or the cam is on a tripod, and who brings a tripod along everywhere they go, that defeats the purpose of having a tiny portable camera, also, if you do have a tripod and lug it around, chances are, you're a pro, and then you wouldn't be looking for a low budget point and shoot like this one) every minute.  Many, many moments can go by unphotographed.  They didn't stop the wedding so I could get the perfect shot.  I needed my camera to be up and ready to go, and sadly, it wasn't.  I guess I'll have to get a more expensive camera to get the kind of quality I demand.Also, this thing can eat up some batteries.  I heard that most digital cameras have this problem, though.  I found I could make them last a little longer though with the old roll the batteries trick.  Works every time :), well at least until your batteries really are dead and it's time to get some new ones.In conclusion, this camera takes great pictures, but you have to wait forever to capture them.  It is so slow, it's frustrating, but the pictures you can manage to take have awesome detail.  It all depends on what you're using the camera for I guess.I do not beleive these are problems specific to this unit, but instead are specific to the brand, or even the entire genre of less expensive, lower end point and shoot digital cameras.  When searching for a camera, I found that most of the less expensive cameras (under $300 or $400 dollars) had reviews that mentioned the same problem of the slow speeds.Hope this is helpful to someone.", "Date": "June 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "great little camera!", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "R3BRES1V4KOF2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "well, heres what i wanted.  a small camera, very small camera (i have a gateway dv-s20, it's smaller than deck decks of cards).  i wanted something that would take great closeup shots.  i wanted something that took at least 3 megapixels.  i wanted something that had auto flash and auto focus capabilites.  something with an optical zoom.most of all, i wanted something around $200.this is what i came up with.whats good about it:good battery life (i use it everyday and i'm on the included batteries still)small, very pocketableeasy as pie to useflash doesn't destroy every picturetakes nice closeup shotsbright displaypicture review navigation is easy to usepicture review incorporates zoom and cut and resize functionszoom is great and easy to useawesome in low light conditionscool red reduction flashmany many built in photo types (scene, portrait...all have several types within)press the button half way to autofocus and see if it will need a flashself timer is easy to useBSS - best shot selector helps you take great picsquick startup timebuilt in shutdown after set timethings i don't like:indoor lighting makes the lcd look junky (pictures turn out ok, but the lcd screen shows off a bunch of random colored fragments - covered in manual, nothing to worry about)i can't cut any of the pictures off of the internal memory (meaning, you can't cut or delete pics from the internal memory using windows explorer because they are copy protected, this means you have to go and manually delete them on the camera)the flash isn't all that great when it's really dark and you want to shoot of pic of something more than 10 feet away (understandable)the flash takes longer than expected to refresh sometimes up to 7 seconds - with scene-underwater because it's the brightest flash)port on side for usb connector seems flimsyBSS does not support a flashaction shot 16 doesn't use a flashit's easy to blur a shot sometimes if you don't have the correct settingsa little heavier than expectedsmall internal memory (14mb)no audio recorded with movies (who cares though, it's a camera, not a camcorder)all in all, you should read the manual to get the most out of this one.  it's excellent for anyone.*** to get rid of the lag after taking a pic with the flash, press the play button, then press it again.  presto! screen doesn't go black anymore!", "Date": "June 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "SLOW", "Author": "Christine", "ReviewID": "RU1138ZJKE8K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This would be a great camera if you have time to wait between shots.

I found it to be a nice light camera to carry in a fanny pack or even in your pocket (if you have cargo pants).  It weighs virtually nothing without the AA batteries that it runs on.  Disposable batteries are good if you're in the woods nowhere near a recharger, but also heavy to carry.  The cheap ones that came with it lasted approx. 20 flash pictures, but with some decent duracells I got to 150 pictures (flash and non flash).  Your mileage may vary.The coolpix comes with a variety of settings for different situations such as for fireworks, indoors, sunsets, etc. but its has a limiting zoom and low ISO rating.  If you are going to be taking any pictures in the dark without a flash (fireworks, inside large buildings that cannot be lit by a flash, etc) BUY A TRIPOD!  One review posted here stated that with the flash everything was bright and it took forever to load the picture, but without a flash the picture was still bright but blurry and \"that doesn't make any sense\".  Here is the reason why: to compensate for the lack of light, you can add light (a flash) OR keep the shutter open longer to admit more light on the film.  When the shutter is open for longer periods of time the picture is more sensitive to your movement and can become blurred.  This is why you need to get a tripod.  But that review was correct in that after a flash picture it is agonizingly slow to load the picture onto the memory card and recharge the flash.AGONIZINGLY.Other stuff: 4.0 megapixels is excellent for a camera of this price, and it can create beautiful pictures in the right light conditions (daylight, outside).  It can take 480x320 movies for as much as the memory chip can hold.The coolpix is an adequate entry level camera.  But I would recommend you spend a little more and get the Canon PowerShot A95.

When you display photos, it does that annoying thing where it displays in low resolution first, and then a couple of seconds later the images quality improves. The most moronic feature of all: when you display photos, it brings up the FIRST picture on your memory card - not the most recent!

The flash is weak, and any night-time shots look grainy and horrible.

It took over 9000 pictures and never once malfunctioned on me. It was done in when the bag it was in was immersed in an inch or so of water. Only the bottom of the camera got wet, so I was pretty surprised when it didn't turn back on, even after drying out. So one piece of advice if you buy this camera: don't drop it in the water! However, it did survive many excursions through humid, misty forests without incident.Pros of this camera-Optical viewfinder (it's a little off-center from where the camera's actually pointing, but it still helps you line up pictures).-Takes great pictures even on the 2MP setting. I've blown them up to 8x10 and pictures still look great, though I'd recommend using the 1600x1200 resolution or greater if you think you will print many pics at this size.-Would hold a charge for weeks at a time on 2500 mA rechargeable AA batteries. I was able to take over 500 pictures on a single charge, even using the flash quite a bit.-Uses SD cards that easily transfer pictures to your computer.-Flash always seemed adequate. It would occasionally wash out a subject, but changing settings would usually improve things.-Easy access to different shooting modes. I switched between \"Beach\" (intense lighting), \"Backlit\", and \"Macro\" often with two or three button presses. The rotating function knob on top was good for switching quickly to action or landscape shots.-Pretty quick focus time (<1 second).-Quick recycle time (1 second) to take another shot, IF you're not using the flash.-Takes decent nighttime pictures of nearby subjects with the flash.-Maintains good color fidelity in high-contrast situations. My girlfriend's Sony DSC-W220 washes out the sunny spots or blacks out the shadows, whereas the 4600 takes a great shot every time.Cons...-A longer startup time than I would like (around 3 seconds). It usually wasn't a big deal, but every once in a while it was.-A long delay (5+ seconds) when taking a picture with flash. I think during this time the camera is writing the image to the memory card. I'd recommend getting a high-speed card, and maybe that problem will be minimized.-Has a really hard time focusing in low-light situations. I have managed to get some good pictures around dusk by playing with the settings (only takes a few button presses), but quite a few images are still blurry. That's the beauty of digital: Even on a cheap camera like this, you can just delete the offending image and try again!I almost bought another 4600 to replace my dead one, but I wanted to try my hand at something that starts up faster and (hopefully) takes better twilight pictures. I went with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS3 if you're curious.I'd definitely recommend this camera to beginners all the way up to intermediate amatuers.

When using flash, there's at least a 13 second delay until you can take another picture. Even on the Museum setting, it's still slow, and images come out grainy. Indoor pictures come out horrible for this camera.  Usually, outdoor pictures come out really well on this camera, so no complaints there. However, on the night setting, there's usually a flash involved, and then objects that are foreground, like trees (when you're trying to capture the sky), are light and vivid, and all that you get of the sky is dark nothingness.  The fireworks setting is amazing for New Years' Eve and 4th of July fireworks, but the delay is more nerve-wracking when taking pictures of fireworks because of the pace.  Just recently, I turned on my camera (after a year and a half of having it), and all I saw was white. I turned the setting dial to Set Up; I saw white. I took a picture, and it flashed but all I saw on the screen was white. I plugged in the USB cord to the side of the camera and the pictures I took while it was white were all solid black, white, or, uh, PINK (of all colors). I'm looking into a better camera, and wondering how I can fix this.  The 'corrected red eye' Isn't really true. I had to correct various cases of red eye in IrfanView.

BTW, My parents have the 3600 which does have video with sound.ALL Point-And-Shoot cameras have the following difficulties:* Shutter delay after you take a picture (you have to wait while the image is read from the CCD, processed, and saved to memory)* Quickly drains battery power if you use the flash and have the LCD screen on the brightest setting (so don't do it!  I hardly use the flash and leave the LCD screen at half brightness level).* you should always use rechargeable batteries with digital camerasSo why buy one over another?  Some have slightly better delays, but more importantly look out for consistent problems, e.g., some Canon PowerShot's seem to have a problem with the lens shutter sticking.I've had my 5600 for over a year now and everything has been great.  However, it has succumbed to a problem that a few other consumers have mentioned, it powers on and takes one picture, and only one picture.  Then you have to cycle power.

They are lighter, however, so it seems as if in that mode it uses the natural light better.  Perhaps the fuzziness is due to a slower shutter time, so maybe unless you have rock solid hands you would have to place the camera on a flat surface or use a tripod. But on automatic it is fine.  I called Nikon and they couldn't give an explanation - the techie that was on the phone did the same thing as me and had the same results.Another drawback is that using the BSS (best shot mode) the camera will not use the flash.

Here's what I found out about my camera:1.  When using the flash it is not normal to have to wait 8 seconds before you can take another picture.2.  The resolution of my LCD is awful compared to the Canon.3.  The 4600 feels kind of cheap and plastic (but in fairness has lasted three years without issue).4.  The 4600 takes far too many blurry pictures.That said, when I was a first time digital user, I liked the 4600.  It is responsible for most of the pictures of my little boy, and has helped me capture some wonderful family moments.  However, in retrospect, I really wish that my wife had bought me the Canon.  For the same price it seems a far superior camera.", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Problems everywhere", "Author": "Victoria Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R2KGUENM5AAYHO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera works fine until you realize that the batteries are down and you change them and still never starts again.

Taking pictures with flash is a big joke, u miss your best moments waiting for the flash to be ready again, it takes forever trying to get the camera to focus in most modes. Was at my little girls graduation and got so frustrated trying to get it to focus to take a pic of her receiving her certificate. I almost smashed it.  Very bad production by Nikon.

The delays in resetting after taking a picture, or the lengthy delays after taking flash photos, are intolerable.  The price is cheap I give you that.

First... to respond to people complaining about how long the flash takes after you take a picture; After you take the picture, push the \"playback\" button and it shortens the time dramatically for the flash to re-load, and it goes straight to the picture. Also, BUY RE-CHARGEABLE batteries. For those who think simple AA batteries are going to last are just plain silly. It doesn't take that much common sense to realize that is all it takes. And that goes for MOST digital camera's. Just think of how much power these little machine's are using!I really, really enjoyed my camera while it lasted. However, after the first time I ever dropped it (about 5 months after having it), it was never the same. I dropped it as the lens was fully zoomed out, and the \"flaps\" that cover the lens broke off, and the outer lens was cracked. Thankfully, it was put back together. Although the \"flaps\" were gone, it still worked fine. It just made funny noises when it was on. Many of the pictures I took with this camera came out very professional looking, and I was very pleased. I took it everywhere with me, and I loved it while it lasted. After a couple more drops, the battery cover will not go back down all the way- even tho it can still turn on, the strap loop has broken off, the area around my zoom button is cracked, and the entire camera won't go back together fully.However, after all of this trauma.. it still held up! It was just earlier this year, when I brought it to Florida with me that it reached it's final days. I was hiking, and taking pictures as I went along, and all of a sudden, I took a picture and there were extreme bright, white lines across the picture. It looked like a very over exposed picture, like I had mistakingly put it on the wrong setting. Unfortunately, there was no fixing this. :( I have figured that something has been knocked off balance after being dropped so much, and it finally stopped working at it's full potential. Ironically enough, I can still take pictures inside with the flash, and get decent pictures. With a little bit of help from paintshop or photoshop, I have been lucky enough to fix some pictures.At this point, the camera is absolutely useless. It saddens me because I had a lot of great luck with this camera. As a photographer, I couldn't complain about the way my pictures came out. It really depends on how you take them and if you can work the camera right. The settings and menu are pretty easy to navigate, the buttons are in the right spots (for me at least), and I could hold this camera in my hand for hours and it'd never get uncomfortable.The Pro's:- when the vivid color option is used, the camera delivers some beautiful, vibrant colors. Especially blues!!-decent size LCD screen-easy to use buttons and menu-good quality pictures when put on the right settings-comfortable fit in your hand, or jeans pocketThe Con's:-cheap, plasticy feel to the camera. Especially with no batteries in it!-the strap loop was the cheapest thing on the camera-very, very bright flash which made it hard to get pictures the first time around. by the 3rd flash (red-eye reduction flash), people would move or squint, etc...-flimsy \"flap\" that covered the lens, could be improved because it broke off instantly when I first dropped it.I'd recommend this camera to anyone who needs a simple, easy to use camera. Mine didn't last as long as I wish it would have, but it was fun while it did. I wish it were $72 when I wanted to buy it!! If you do buy it, just be sure to take care of it... try not to drop it because it will never be the same if you do!!", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "We love it!", "Author": "Paula L.
