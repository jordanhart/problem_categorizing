I was not disappointed.  Being new to a digital SLR, I was worried that I would not be familiar enough with the camera to get good pictures but that was not an issue.  Great pictures of a great trip.  I also bought the 55-300mm VR Lens along with it and that is a fantastic addtion to an already great set-up.  I highly recommend both items.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great!!!
