{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good working tool", "Author": "Brian Matsumoto", "ReviewID": "R1AVW17B30DDU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our Sony a7R arrived five days ago and we, my wife and I, have had a chance to put the camera through its paces. Although, it does not have a kit lens, we also have a Sony a7 that comes with a 28-70 mm lens. Our experience with the a7R reflects using that lens.As we expected the camera works great, delivering consistent exposure in dim or bright light. We have found autofocus speed to be good under daylight conditions. We have used it indoors and have been satisfied with its automatic focusing speed, although in dim light it takes a tad longer. We have used the Sony NEX-6 and NEX-7 and found the a7R's focusing speed comparable to those two cameras. For most subjects, the focusing speed is fast enough and we found it satisfactory.We rely heavily on manual focusing, especially for our scientific photography work. This camera makes manual focusing a pleasure. The camera has two modes for facilitating focus. One is the traditional increase in viewfinder magnification: the center of which is magnified for close inspection of fine detail. The increased magnification sacrifices the field of view. The other is peaking. This provides a pseudo colored fringe around in-focus edges and provides us the advantage of seeing the whole field of view. We have used both and find them to be powerful working tools when focusing lenses manually.The electronic viewfinder works very well with a diopter control for focusing ones eye to the screen and various aids for evaluating exposure. Not only does the viewing screen vary in brightness as one departs from the recommended exposure, but there is a histogram displayed in the viewfinder. In addition, there is a \"zebra\" mode. This causes over exposed highlights to display stripes and is a good indicator of when and where you will lose your highlight detail.We have taken some great shots in dim lighting conditions. For us, we took advantage of Sony's Image Data Converter software v. 4.0 and opened the images into this program; however, we note that this program immediately applies an aggressive noise reduction filter so that in regions with fine detail the image appears \"smudged\". We found it preferable to turn off the noise reduction in that program and save the image as a 16-bit tiff. This picture can then be processed in Photoshop where we used Noise Ninja to reduce the effects of noise without losing fine detail. We were happy with pictures taken at ISO 3200.The a7R's major weakness, in our opinion, is the paucity of full frame Sony autofocus lenses for this camera. While you can use the NEX series of lenses, this will use only the central part of the sensor. When you do so, the camera crops down and provides a 15-megapixel (4800x3200 pixels) image. If you are willing to sacrifice autoexposure, autofocus, and image stabilization you do have the option of using non-Sony lenses. We have used a 20 mm AIS Nikon and while we need more time to check the image files to evaluate edge sharpness and chromatic aberration, our initial results look promising. We used these lenses in Aperture-priority mode, letting the camera set the shutter speed while we set the lens diaphragm. With the camera operating in \"stopped down\" mode, it gave us a real time depth of field display. It should be noted that when using the camera in Aperture priority or Manual mode, the lens is always used in a stopped down mode. So autofocus speed of E mount lenses will be slower when you use smaller apertures. In dim lighting conditions, using these modes will also cause the lens to \"hunt\" for focus when the aperture is closed down or if you are using a slow lens. If focusing speed is an issue, try using P or S mode on the camera..There is a lot more to describe about this camera, but in a nutshell it is a reliable photographic tool. We have noticed that it does consume batteries. We ordered a couple of spare batteries by the second day. We also prefer to use an independent battery charger rather than charging the batter through the camera body.Update 1We have been working with the LEAE4 lens adapter for the a7R and we are very satisfied with the combination. As noted in our review, we felt a weakness of this series of cameras is the lack of full frame autofocus lenses that can be used with this camera. One solution is to buy the LAEA4 adapter that accepts Sony's A mount lenses and maintains full autofocus capability. This adapter is quite complex and as a result it is expensive. It contains a semi-transparent mirror that directs a fraction of the light to a set of focusing sensors. This unit takes over focusing and, essentially, converts the a7R to a SLT camera. In essence it replaces the contrast detection focusing system with a phase detection one. This has a couple of advantages. First, there is an increase in focusing speed over the contrast based system. Second, it appears that this unit has more sensitivity for working in lower light levels. Finally, this unit will work with the older, discontinued, Minolta AF and Konica-Minolta AF lenses. Many of these lenses rely on a focusing motor housed in the camera body and this adapter contains such a motor. So as a consequence, this adapter will autofocus with older discontinued Minolta products and it will autofocus all of Sony's A-series AF lenses.  The adapter weighs only 4 ounces and does not adversely affect camera handling. Also, it is well designed. If you use a Sony A series lens which is designed for an APS-C sensor, the unit will \"crop\" down and use only the center of the a7R sensor to provide an image free of vignetting.With this adapter we have used a 500 m f8.0 Minolta AF Mirror lens, their 100-300 mm APO zoom telephoto lens, and a Tamron 90 mm f/2.8 macro lens. We also used the kit lens from our A77 to test the \"auto crop\" capability of the adapter and camera combo.  With these lenses, the unit autofocuses  the lens rapidly in dim lighting conditions.Although this adapter is more expensive than the LAEA3 adapter, we feel its expense is justified. The former adapter will only autofocus those lenses which have a focus motor built-in the lens barrel while the latter will focus all autofocus lenses in the A line. In addition, the latter unit focuses rapidly.  These two features make the additional expense more acceptable.Update 2:Recently I decided to upload some Apps from Sony's online store. As you may know, Sony NEX cameras and the a7/a7R camera have wireless capability that enables them to transfer images to smartphones and tablets. In addition, this capability can be used to download apps to your camera to provide it additional features. For example, Sony does not have time lapse capability in its NEX-6 or a7R camera, but you can install an App to provide that capability.One of Sony's free Apps is their Smart Remote Control and this useful feature has undergone improvements since its been first released. For example, when I first used Smart Remote Control I was overjoyed that it would work on my iPAD mini. It was tremendously convenient to have a large screen for focusing and composing images. For macro work it was nice to put the camera low to the ground and position it without having to hunch down and get close to view the tilted LCD screen. However, when I found that the first release of that software could not save RAW files to the camera's memory card, I abandoned using it.Well, I revisited the Sony App store and found they updated and improved the program. Most importantly, they allow the saving of RAW files to the camera's memory card. You cannot just save RAW files however. You must save RAW + JPEG and I presume this is necessary so that the smaller size files could be uploaded, wirelessly, to either a tablet or a smart phone. I don't use this feature, but prefer using it as a replacement for a remote cable release.  For what it is worth, while a smartphone can be used, I find the mini tablets and tablets to be preferable since their larger screen provides a larger preview of the subject. For those who manually focus their cameras, the enlarged image is detailed enough to accomplish this task with ease.Although I have the cable release for the a7R, I find that I hardly use it. The Smart Remote Control App will work with smartphones. It seems I always forget to take my cable release, but I never forget my smartphone. Considering that the Smart Remote Control is free, it is well worth getting.Another nice thing about the App store. They keep track of the Apps you have downloaded to your camera. So, if you have to do a total reset of the camera's settings and values (this wipes out the apps) you can download replacement Apps at no charge.One final note, you are not penalized if you buy a new Sony camera. In my case, I had downloaded the time lapse App for the NEX-6. For a time this was unavailable for the a7 series of cameras. Well, it recently became updated to work with these cameras and I was not charged when I upload it to my new Sony camera.Update 3:I loaded the new firmware on the a7R camera so now I am using version 1.02. The camera functions much as it did before and I did not see a dramatic increase in focusing speed or focusing accuracy in AF-S or AF-Continuous under outdoor lighting during the day. But, then I was reasonably satisfied with the original firmware. When using the CZ 24-70 mm f4.0 lens, I felt that the new firmware did improve the focusing accuracy under dim lighting. There was less \"hunting\". The most dramatic improvement I observed was the performance of the Object tracking function. The performance of that was much improved and the camera did a better job of following objects and maintaining focus on the targeted subject.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Believe the hype! But A7R is not for everyone.", "Author": "Wat", "ReviewID": "R1A7TP6A39I1MM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I\u2019ll cut to the chase - the image quality (resolution and color) are the best I\u2019ve ever seen. It truly is ground breaking to be holding such a powerful tool that is so compact and relatively affordable compared to the other 36 MP cameras the Nikon D800 and D800E.What really puts it over the top is that the two lenses I own for it, the Zeiss FE 35mm f/2.8 and 55mm f/1.8 are among the finest lenses made. The 55mm has even been ranked as the top resolving AF lens by DXO mark. They worked great on my A7, but they really explode with their full potential on the A7R.For context, you can look up my A7 review on Amazon under my name. The gist of that review was that the A7 is an incredible all-around stills and video camera that is not quite as good as my Nikon D600 was, but the size and other features made it the best for me at that moment after two months of use. I gave it four stars.I\u2019ve owned the A7R for two weeks and have since sold the A7, but NOT because the A7R is a better all-around camera. Quite the opposite. The A7R is more specialized and requires more patience to use, but as I mentioned, the files just blow me away with detail.What I ShootThe A7R is my \u201cstudio\u201d camera and also for travel. The image quality is fantastic for portraits and landscapes. Like most folks, I\u2019ve dreamed of having the raw power of a medium format camera, but spending ten to thirty thousand dollars was way out of the question. There was a lot of hype when the D800 came out and comparisons made to medium format produced results which were very comparable. Now two years later that level of power is a bit more affordable and very compact to boot!What the A7R is not ideal forThe A7R is not a good all around camera. The autofocus is a bit slow (A7 is definitely faster) so I wouldn\u2019t use it for family shots with fast moving kids. The shutter is quite loud so it\u2019s not ideal for candid shots. My current \u201call around\u201d camera is the Sony RX10. With a superb Zeiss 24-200mm f/2.8 lens and a large 1\u201d sensor, the RX10 is perfect for almost anything. BUT, when I need the maximum resolution and quality, that\u2019s when I turn to the A7R.True game changer\u2026for meThe A7R has really raised my expectations for the type of image files possible. It\u2019s really put my priorities for photography in much clearer focus. No camera or group of cameras is going to be perfect for everything. It\u2019s all about finding the right tools for what you want to do. For me, that search has ended with the combo of the RX10 and A7R. I would love to add something that is truly pocket size, but honestly the A7R, RX10 and the two FE lenses have really stretched my bank account. I\u2019m very happy though and having a great time enjoying focusing on photography.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "The mother of all walk-around cameras !", "Author": "Gerald \"polemicallycorrect\"", "ReviewID": "RD6XWG6DCAYC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a Nikon D4, Canon 1D4, 1Ds3. I'd never owned a pro-level Sony before. I usually run around, say, Paris with multiple pro-bodies around my neck. I still will do that, but now I can also take the occasional stroll with nothing but the Sony A7R.To be sure, this camera, imho, doesn't replace a DSLR. Fast-paced action ? The A7R is out of its depth. But, if you have time to shoot, it is truly wonderful. I have the Zeiss 35mm 2.8 lens which, despite its tiny size, delivers great results. I've used my Canon and Nikon lenses on the A7R with great success. For the first time ever I LOVE manual focus. It's so easy on the A7R - focus magnification and peaking make it a piece of cake for landscape, portrait, street photography. Since I love to shoot at big apertures (1.2, 1.4), this is actually easier than with AF. The precision and ease to achieve it is truly astonishing.Quibbles - the magnifying button is in a stupid location. The plastic covers on the various plugs are gimpy.If you own legacy glass or are planning on buying old manual focus lenses, this is your camera. I could never do manual focus on the D4 with such ease.The EVF is surprisingly great. Sure, its no huge D4 viewfinder, but especially in difficult light situations it's great to see exactly what you'll get.Image quality is unsurpassed. I wouldn't worry about file size, even my 2013 MacBook Air has no trouble, let alone my iMac and MacPro.I'd advise getting spare batteries. I got some Wasabis that work fine. I actually like that the camera can be charged through USB, as I have an ANKER portable USB charger, so I can charge the camera without a power outlet.Another advantage - it doesn't advertise \"professional photographer here!\" No layperson would think the camera plus 35mm lens costs almost $3400 (with tax).There's barely any learning curve either. For every-day photos/snapshots functions such as smile recognition, registering faces etc. come in very handy. The only thing I am missing is GPS.I certainly recommend this camera without hesitation.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "An Instrument", "Author": "Mr. Cody Daniel", "ReviewID": "R35IIFEI78M25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning this camera for a month and running nearly 5k photos through it I feel prepared to make a review.I'll summarize first.  This camera makes an impression.  People will notice and ask \"Is that a film camera?  It doesn't look digital.  Reminds me of an old camera.\"  Which to me means that people have a certain expectation of modern DSLRs, of plastic and bulk and digital menus. In comparison this evokes the feeling of an older film instrument, flush with tuning dials, full of power, and a certain raw pleasure to use.By day I build microscopes and high precision instrumentation rigs.  The A7R is an extension of this mentality.  A very high performance, raw sensor package is coupled to an extremely high performance computer, capable of real time entropy calculations for focus peaking, real time gain adjustment and dynamic range monitoring, and video processing to supply the EVF.  The machine is highly tuned, and when coupled with powerful glass and manipulated by a knowing hand, the resulting images are profound.Most of my shooting has been with adapters to Minolta and Zeiss glass using the myriad array of adapters available on Amazon for $10-15 each.  Between the MD adapter, M42, and Canon FD I've been able to use all of my old lenses with zero problems, including a 50 year old Minolta 50mm f/1.4 ($50 on ebay) and a stellar Zeiss Flektogon 35mm F/2.4.The power to use any vintage lens with an adapter (all your leica glass will easily mate, but so will crazy russian stuff, old vivitar series 1, or my schneider scientific lenses) is to me half the fun!  Grabbing an old lens at a camera shop or online for a couple of bucks and playing around with it is a joy on it's own, but mated to the A7R you have a powerful photon grabbing machine.  Focus Peaking auto-highlights your focal plane in real time through the EVF, meaning I can manual focus faster than any autofocus using that most powerful calculator, my eye and brain.  And thanks to the configurable dials, I have my ISO and shutter speed in convenient locations and can rapidly set up for a shot by simply scrolling my dials, adjusting my focus, and firing that extremely pleasurable shutter.Speaking of, the shutter deserves it's own kudos.  Some complain it is too loud.  I'll say it is louder than the A7.  It is about as loud as a DSLR.  I find it immensely satisfying.  There's a beautiful mechanical \"thud\" that feels like a life-affirming statement from this machine that _that_ was the shot you wanted to take.  Ka-CLICK!Those in the know will ask why the A7R vs. A7?  For me it was about raw silicon power.  I wanted a giant full frame sensor to point at the world, and the A7R delivers.  I rarely use autofocus, and currently don't own any autofocus capable lenses.  As such the lower resolution and phase-detection are both negatives for me.  With the wicked fast focus peaking and EVF, I find little need for AF and am far happier with that extra resolution and noise floor.I'll close with this: Yesterday I was playing around at the motorcycle club shooting people's bikes and their working, when a fellow came up and asked what I was shooting.  He played around with it and told me that he used to shoot for the NYT, and was given a Leica M8 several weeks before they were released to field test it.  At the time it was the finest instrument available and he used it for many, many years.  After playing with the A7R he told me he got the same feeling from this camera as he did from the old M8 he first demoed, and that he would likely be switching over.  He then asked \"what the hell are those boys at Nikon doing with themselves?\"What indeed!  To great engineering, I say thank you Sony.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Image quality", "Author": "Tomoham", "ReviewID": "R2WVX0N44BGWMI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the A7r with 35mm lens in Singapore Duty free at the beginning of December.  I use it on four days in Japan shooting the beautiful fall colors and comparing it with my Canon 5D MK3 with Tamron 24-70mmm f2.8, which up to now has been my best camera when it comes to image quality.  Not any more.  While, I have many lenses for the canon, mostly expensive L lenses, I can see myself now carrying the sony with this single lens about 90 percent of the time.  The image quality of this lens is incredible.  The details and the sharpness are amazing.  With this level of details, I see that I no longer need a zoom lens as I can crop easily and not lose much details.  In the future, I may buy an equally sharp telephoto lens, but for now I am satisfied with the 35mm prime.  The fact that I can take the camera with this lens with me anywhere without lugging around huge weight has big appeal to me.  But not only this, the picture quality of the A7r beats the MK3 hands down for my kind of photography, mostly landscapes and street photography.  The camera got almost everything I want, but I wish it had GPS and flash built-in.  Both are not major omissions but nice to have features.  The built in wifi is great as I now can load the photos in my iPhone anytime after the shooting.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Game Changer?", "Author": "Zachary Long \"Wedding Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "RI35X37ICBLWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a fulltime wedding photographer and was looking for a new \"fun\" camera when I didn't want to bring the full size DSLR with me when I'm just going out with the family. I previously owned the Olympus OM-D E-M5 16MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3.0-Inch Tilting OLED Touchscreen and 12-50mm Lens (Silver) which performed really well, however didn't quite give me the experience I was looking for in the darkroom (Lightroom) or in the field. Not saying that the OM-D E-M5 is a bad camera, I just expected better (though the new E-M1 Olympus OM-D E-M1 Compact System Camera with 16MP and 3-Inch LCD - Body Only seems to solve any issues I had with the E-M5). When Sony announced the new A7 & A7r I knew I had to get one and pre-oredered here on Amazon on the day it was announced. Having the camera for a little over a week now, I've brought it with me to a wedding as well as using it around town with my son, here are my thoughts with the Sony/Zeiss 35mm lens Sony SEL35F28Z Camera Lenses and also using the Metabones Canon EF Lens to Sony NEX Smart Adapter, Mark III to adapt my current Canon lenses to the A7r.Focus is of course slower when comparing the 5D Mark III side-by-side when I was shooting two cameras at the wedding, the A7r you need to be much more methodical with your shots and planning due to the low frames per second and slower focusing time. The positive is that it forced me to slow down as well with the framing and composition of my shots, however during \"high action\" portions of the wedding day I'm not sure I could trust the A7r to lock AF in time to grab a moment when I needed it to. This particular wedding I shot the A7r with was indoors since it's December at the moment, which probably doesn't help the AF speed with the f/2.8 Sony 35mm lens. The 5D Mark III by comparison was much quicker. Outdoors during the day with my son, the Sony/Zeiss 35mm  lens performed better but still not exactly what I would call \"fast.\"That said, even with the slightly slower focusing speed, the ability to do focus peaking on the gorgeous rear screen was a new and welcome experience for me. I could easily maneuver the camera around since it's so light and using the rear LCD compose and grab the shot in a crowded area. With focus peaking engaged, it takes a bit of a learning curve to know where you're going to hit focus but I'm starting to get the hang of it and loving it. Using the Metabones Mark III adapter focus is MUCH slower with Canon L lenses and the focus peaking here really helps. The fact that the Metabones allows for AF to still engage is quite the miracle as well, it's so nice to let the camera do the work as well when it's a static scene like a landscape.Build quality is great as it feels good in my hands. I wish the camera extended about one inch at the bottom so I could really wrap my pinky around with larger hands, maybe someone will make a smaller grip in the future. The current Sony grip for the A7r looks way too big for my discrete second camera needs. Just grab some batteries here on Amazon and you're good to go. I personally am using these Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Sony NP-FW50 and Sony Alpha 7, a7, Alpha 7R, a7R, Alpha a3000, NEX-3, NEX-3N, NEX-5, NEX-5N, NEX-5R, NEX-5T, NEX-6, NEX-7, NEX-C3, NEX-F3, SLT-A33, SLT-A35, SLT-A37, SLT-A55V, Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 and can confirm they work perfectly with the A7r and the charger works for both the Wasabi and OEM Sony battery. The battery does drain pretty fast I must admit compared to Canon's LP-E6 which can go most of the day in my 5D Mark III.The files are a joy to work with in Lightroom and have a ton of dynamic range. Highlight recovery seems to be much better than Canon files in particular. Having to sort of \"re-learn\" how to edit and get a nice look from the files I'm happy with but it's a small learning curve. I would imagine if you currently shoot Nikon things will be much easier for you as the sensors are similar to those found in Nikon cameras like the D800.You can see a longer review with photo examples on my blog, which probably won't be linked here in this Amazon review but I'm sure anyone looking for A7r wedding photography can find it.Overall love the camera and can't wait to get out to shoot more with it! Looking forward to the next batch of full frame lenses from Sony or third parties!", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Photographers Review", "Author": "Jose Armenteros", "ReviewID": "R2VFBO9PB8LPEY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We need more experienced reviewers giving insight on this camera so I figured I would give my two cents on this camera. Not a seller or number of FE lenses out there.Here is what matters it has amazing detail and of course that detail is effected by the glass. I have shot a Leica 50mm .95 lens on it was stellar. Better then that lens on the M9 even... Now I also shoot a Nikkor 50mm 1.4 AIS lens on this and it was amazing as well. No getting around how beautiful this sensor captures images. Even an old Canon 50mm 1.8 looks great on this camera and it only cost 20 dollars. So the sensor is amazing and what the camera does with those images is superb. After all this is the same lens also found in the Nikon D800E but in a much more attractive package and a very convenient size.The camera feels amazing it is built very will with nice attention to detail. It feels like a modern classic and will be one of the awesome cameras that will be a fun camera to pass down 20 years from now to your child if they get into photography.I dont care to much for auto-focus cameras as I usually do not use AF lenses to begin with but the peaking manual focus aid is amazing and makes manual focusing  a breeze. (For those saying they cant focus manually you need to make sure the picture is metered right or else it wont sow the peaks) So stop complaining and understand the camera and also take a well metered photo :)I did get to use the AF lens for a little while and it does well during the day with no real issue per say. I do notice some delays in low light but that is the room for improvement on this camera that could make this a 5 star camera. It is however still very useful though and will work just not as fast as the A7. Again though if you are not taking fast action or moving shots its better to manual focus anyway.If you do not shoot in RAW then I would not get this camera and just grab an A7. The whole point of the A7R is to grab the most detail so that is why the low pass filter has been removed to give you more detail and fine tune the image to pure perfection. I am sure if you are one that would buy this camera you do post processing anyway.Gorgeous camera and truly ground breaking and a camera that will be a historical camera for the books. This is the first and a well executed first at that. Sony is making moves and as a long time fan of Nikon I must say they have my attention. So much that the fumble with Nikon's DF I went straight to Sony with this camera and I love it.Pure photography with this beauty and it has a lot of adapters made for other cameras mount systems makes this a universal camera that can take any lens so don't fret so much with its limited lenses. Trust me the success with this camera will make a ton of lenses come to this FE E mount system. But I love old Leica glass so I will keep using those on this beauty.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product even for a canon user", "Author": "PYang", "ReviewID": "R2Q5FAGG0QGSPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera might be the best 35mm product of the year, period. For the past 4 years, I have been mainly shooting with my Canon 5D Mark II  with a bunch of EF L lenses. 5D Mark II is a great product in many aspects but A7r really beats it in terms of image quality.I have tested this camera with a Metabones EF-E mount III adapter. All of my EF lenses works fine although the autofocus may up to 3 seconds, which is inadequate for moving objects. These includes, EF 24-105mm f/4 L USM, EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L USM and EF 100-400mm f/4-5.6 L. Focusing infinity, focusing accuracy and distance are perfect. Other than those lenses, I tried my TS 17mm, which is a manual lens; still you are able to change the electronic aperture. The 14mm Rokinon f/2 lens has no color shifting issue although bears little distortion.The overall image quality is superb. Attaching my 24-105, the image sharpness is much better than that on 5D Mark II. Bear in mind that motion-shake reduction function on the lens are not working even with the adapter. At 5000 ISO, handheld at night, you can still be able to focus well and reproduce a usable, very usable, photo, even at 100% zoom. Focus peaking is accurate at \"high\" settings, and helps a lot if you are using manual focusing, particularly with legacy lenses or rangefinder lenses. Magnification for manual focusing, however, will not turn on automatically, rather the photographer needs to deploy it manually. But once it's on, it's like the tiger opening its mouth, one shot kill.The camera is light, if you are a DSLR shooter. However, that might be its biggest drawback for some photographers. It is too light that if you attach it to a telephoto lens such as 70-200mm, it is hard to balance it with your arms. As a result, it is harder for this combo to get a steady shot comparing to DSLR. The reason for this is, the small grip gives less contact area between your fingers and palm and the camera. No matter how strong you are, it just feel less comfortable.For the button setup, I don't think one other than a sony user can really judge. If you are like me who have been shooting with 5D Mark II for years, you are just too family with the buttons and menus. So anything new, no matter if the design is good or not, is awkward for you.The built in EVF (Electronic View Finder) is like a mini screen with a horizontal leveler and tilt indicator. It's hard to see your focus area in manual mode especially in smaller aperture (f4 and up) without the help of focus peaking. Again if you turn it on, it will become a beast.The RAW file size is about 36mb, which is not quite significantly large. My 128 empty SD card can hold 3400 RAW 36M pixel photos. But do consider upgrading your SD card unless you are a D800 shooter.Overall, this is a well built, high quality, superb image rendering camera. If you are not sure about it, there are already numerous field test reports and reviews online with many sample shots and parallel comparisons. At present, it is confident for me to say no cameras, full frame or not, can compete with A7r in terms of overall image quality from Canon. And DSLR is no superior than mirrorless system other than built in OVF.Yes, I would recommend this.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "A7r review from a Nex 5n/7 user", "Author": "David Lee", "ReviewID": "R1YNW3NJS5LJ9K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the A7r for about a week now and here's my initial review.  I'm going to try to keep it on a high level since you can dig into plenty of hardcore review sites.Background:  I've owned the Sony Nex-5n and NEx-7.  I mainly shoot landscape and size is a huge factor since I like to hike tounique spots.Build:  It's fairly solid and dense.  From a size perspective, it's significantly bigger than the 5n and in the same ballpark as the 7.  But it's much more solid than either camera.  And this is reflected in the weight..it's roughly 200 grams more than the 7.  But still quite a bit less than a full blown slr.  For a hiker, the 400 gram difference between a slr and A7r might not seem big..but if you add in the space it takes, then you really see the size benefit.  If you've used the NEX7's EVF, I don't see a huge difference but then again I've never been part of the whole OVF vs EVF debate.  I haven't tested the weather sealing other than survive a few rain drops.  I hope somebody tests this fully before I have to.Image Quality:  Coming from the NEX7, it wasn't a mind blowing jump in resolution.  That being said, you still get an extra 12 megapixels so you'll see the differences at 100% or large prints.  In terms of low light performance and dynamic range, this was a significant leap.  Noise reduction processing is still something that needs to be on your mind.  Detail is good up through ISO 3200 but you do see noise at fairly low iso (400+).  For some reason I wasn't expecting to do much noise reduction until ISO 1600.  The JPGs coming out of the camera aren't that great.  I would just shoot RAW and PP in lightroom or equivalent.Ergonomics:  This was probably the biggest negative of the camera.  The grip depth seems too shallow and I don't exactly have giant hands.  The shutter position isn't as bad as some make it but it really depends on how you hold the camera.  The playback magnification control is in a ridiculous position.  I hope they eventually let you remap that.  The menu button, that accesses the heart of the camera, also seems to be in an obscure position.Lens compatibility:  I've mainly been using rangefinder lenses, in addition to the native NEX crop lenses, on the 5n and 7.  Once the A7r was announced, I sold some of the crop lenses and bought a few dslr lenses.  As others have noted, there are issues with rangefinder wide angles.  SLR lenses seem to do quite well and if you look for sharp legacy lenses, you can get them cheap.  The downside being the additional bulk.  As a balance, I have the NEX 10-18 if I need ultrawide (it works 13-16mm on FF).  The 35 FE for wide and rangefinder 50 for standard.  This seems to keep the overall system size fairly small.  I'm using an old Nikon 75-150 f3.5 a zoom since it's relatively small but may try the 70-200 FE when it comes out.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the camera.  There's a slight adjustment if you've never shot full frame but the benefits are pretty substantial.  I view the camera as a tool, and going to full frame just gives you more functionality and flexibility.  Is it worth the upgrade from crop...I think so.  Is it worth more than the A7?  I think that's more of a personal decision based on your needs.Update: Lens Compatibility - I bought a Nikon F mount version of the Zeiss 18mm.  It performed pretty poorly to the point of sold it.  After the fact, I found out wide angles, even for slr lenses, are much more sensitive to adapter tolerances.  Given the high resolution of this camera, I wouldn't skimp on an adapter.  (I used the cheapest one amazon sold).I took this camera on a week long trip across the southwest and it performed great.  I had snow melt directly ontop of it and didn't notice any water ingress past the mount. But the fact it seeped in a little doesn't give me great confidence in shooting extended times in a storm.  But I wouldn't mind taking quick shots in the rain.Image quality is spectacular and I'm ok with using this up to ISO 6400.  If all the FE lenses are designed to the same standards as the two released, this will be a great system.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Resolution, love the compact body", "Author": "MarkABee", "ReviewID": "RCWQWGHJJMQ6S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long time Canon person with 6 Canon mount lenses and a Canon 5D Mk III.  I bought the Sony A7R because I wanted to try the higher resolution that has long been available for Nikon 800E users but not for Canon fans.  I bought the A7R with the Metabones Canon EF adapter but also the Sony/Zeiss 35MM F2.8  and the Sony/Zeiss 24-70mmm F4.0.I am still getting used to the a7R and where all the buttons are located.  Right off the bat, you have to love the size and lightweight of the body.  I think that the a7R and 2 lenses and flash would weigh the same as the Canon 5D and 1 lens.  I have also owned Leica equipment and the a7R reminded me of how easy it is to just have the camera around since it is smaller and lighter.  The programmable buttons are great and I think after set up the camera can do everything I would like.  I feel confident that when I take a picture it will turn out well.I also like the options for wireless controlling the camera from the iPhone app or small wireless remote control.  I have also gotten a small Sony flash.OK, downsides.  The major complaint is the shutter which is a little loud and has a lot of moving parts.  Normally with the 35mm, I just snapped away.  However, I can think of many situations where you might wish it was quieter.  Second, not a real complaint but my adapting to the Sony is the electronic viewfinder and how quickly it goes to sleep to save power.  You have to push down on the shutter button to get it to wake up.  Which leads me to No. 3 - power consumption.  The camera does consume its battery relatively quickly.  I have gotten the grip accessory which lets you insert two batteries.  A good thing to get and it actually makes the camera easier to hold.With the 35mm F2.8, the Sony focuses quickly and the pictures are very sharp  - excellent - from F4.0 onwards.  The 35mm really shows off the high resolution of the Sony 36.4 MP and you can pixel peek all day long.  You can read some of the reviews of the 35mm and you know that this lens is one of the best available at any price.  This is a great lens to leave on the camera all the time.  It is very compact and the combination A7R and 35mm is a great combination for traveling or walking about.  It gives you the portability of a small snapshot camera but the resolution of the most professional large body device.  I just got the Sony 24-70mm F4.0 so I cannot comment.On adapting Canon mount lenses, I have tried the A7R with the Canon 24-70 F2.8 L II - the new one - with the Metabones adapter.  My major issue is that the focusing took a long time with some hunting.  I guess I should be amazed that it worked at all!  The auto exposure worked fine and the Canon lens really showed its great resolution at all focal lengths.  I don't think this is the combination for street shooting but it would work for some carefully composed pictures.  The Canon 24-70 on the Canon 5D III is works beautifully so I think the fault is the hybrid mixing of two systems.  I also used the A7R with several Zeiss Canon mount lenses I have - the 21mm and the 18mm - and they worked fine and are very sharp.  In this case, the focusing is manual.My conclusion is that native Sony/Zeiss lenses work great and focus quickly.  Canon mount lenses do not focus as quickly but it is a cheap price to pay to be able to use your Canon lenses on the Sony system when you want.The bottom line for me is that I really enjoy the a7R.  It is small and compact and is the kind of camera that you will carry on that next trip to Asia or Europe - or to see the kids play.  The light weight and size make it easy to throw in a briefcase or camera bag.  Finally, with the Metabones adapter, you can use your other lenses and see if they are up to 36 MP.  I am happy I bought the a7R and I am still finding out its many features.  Fun!", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "A7R vs  A7 vs RX1R vs EM-1...", "Author": "Radio Man \"yarns13\"", "ReviewID": "RET2CYVGXC8KY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently sold my Sony RX1R in order to afford this Sony A7R.  I love photography but am also a bit of a gear head. :) Hence I have owned all these cameras and still have the EM1.I say that cause there are so many good to great mirror-less cameras out there now you almost can't choose a bad one..it will come down to which one best fits your needs. I actually LOVED my RX1R but hated having to use the external evf, and it was a bit awkward to hold, a bit slippery as it has no real grip. As to IQ with the 35mm FE lens it has been my experience in good to semi dim light the A7R has more pop and 3d and WOW factor to photos than did my RX1R. The A7R DEFINITELY focuses much faster than the RX1s and so for me has been more accurate too, as to auto focus even in lower light...less hunting if any. I generally use auto with manual assist..in that way you just CAN'T miss a shot with this A7R. Though DXo says otherwise, it SEEMS to me THOUGH, the RX1s had slightly better high iso as far as noise goes. BUT if you re-size down a bit with this A7R it has a very nice tight grain in low light and high iso...mostly any grain that was there even if you didn't post process the noise out, all but vanishes once you re-size to a more manageable file size instead of looking at a 36meg file at 100%. The A7R just feels much better in the hand than the rx1 does and obviously you won't be stuck with JUST 35mm, \"my main reason for trading up to the A7R vs the RX1R.\" One other thing, a slight negative here, is that the jpeg engine at higher isos even with Noise Reduction set to low will really mush up your photos. I felt the RX1 processed jpegs better as to NOISE NOT as to color though. If you are spending this much on a camera though, you are going to be shooting raw..or jpeg plus raw..so the jpegs you may get at high ios are not an issue. At lower isos and in fairly good light I have gotten some drop dead gorgeous jpeg files from this A7R by the way..I had purchased the A7 first...and it's a fine camera TOO but it's output just didn't WOW me as the A7R does, it's just THAT simple, and why I wanted something just a LITTLE bit better as to DETAIL and POP in the IQ..I felt my RX1R's IQ bested the A7 ever so slightly. As to the famous loud shutter noises on these A7's maybe its just me but I actually prefer the feel and sound of the A7R over the A7. The A7's shutter to ME sounded almost like some sort of metal scraping sound...A7R sounds like a camera, and it's shutter actually feels very smooth and fluid. I have read many reviews stating one reason to choose the A7 OVER the A7R is that with the 36 megapixels, you will need use very high shutter speeds and or a tripod to avoid camera shake. I'm not sure why but I actually have had LESS camera shake at shutter speeds as low as 1/25/1/30 on the A7R, Better than the A7, weird. In my case I can almost always get tack sharp photos if I stick to 1/60 or 1/80/ shutter on this A7R in low light. Too bad the Sony doesn't have image stabilization in the body such as the 5 axis in the EM-1. Which brings me to that camera.I still own the EM-1 and it's a great, GREAT, GREAT camera, I'd say with a tad better build quality OVER the A7's but it's pretty close. If you need rocket fast auto focus the EM1 can't be beat.Obviously there's already a TON of great M/4 glass another win for the EM1 if you want to use auto focus at least,..I have a few primes and that GREAT 12-40 2.8 Oly ZOOM. Because the 5 axis image stabilization is so GOOD, you can get sharp picture after picture at shutter speeds of just 1/5 sometimes lower on EM1. So NO, the EM1 can't touch the A7R on high ISOS not even close, but you don't NEED to go anywhere near the high isos you will need to on the A7R cause you will need to use the faster shutter speeds on A7R in low light.\"But at the end of the day on the overall..pictures from the A7R will just have SO much more dynamic range, will be so much richer with more pop than the EM1 \"in my opinion\". So if your ultimate goal is the VERY best jaw dropping photos you can keep..to me the A7R is just in another league than the EM1 great as it is.NOT as well rounded though, Em1 is VERY good re: IQ...A7R is drop dead WOW as to IQ if you get it all right. One last thing vs EM1 you MAY just get more keepers though WITH the EM1 than the A7R so again it all depends upon your needs.For me I am strictly talking about THE BEST photo quality and DETAIL when all is right and for that \"in my opinion\" as I have had all these cameras here the A7R is my GO TO camera if I want a photo that will blow me away Forever. I didn't go into all the features here on the A7R cause if you are reading this you probably already know WHAT it can do as to features. My purpose here was to just really rate the picture quality (IQ) vs RX1, A7, and EM1 and for me, and even just about every Pro review out there as to PURE IQ the A7R in my case at least is THE best camera I have ever owned..and you may find you will agree with this if you get one. Keep in mind there is no ONE perfect camera for EVERY need, my review is JUST about the end result...the PHOTO, when all is right I think this A7R is the camera to beat right now...and BTW overall colors are GREAT including very natural skin tones.

I also own a 5DMKiii and the images that come out of this area are far superior and HUGE! I bought this camera and own both the 55mm and the 35mm lenses. Camera is small and easy to carry around, button layout take some time to get used to as my primary camera is a 5D. After a bit it is very comfortable in my hands and I can grab the shots I want quickly.Now the negative. Working in studio with only strobes going, AutoFocus is a huge pain. The AF is slow and because there is low light it has problems with face detect on. It is hard to get in a rhythm of shooting, I was always sitting there waiting for AF to lock on, then take the shot, wait and wait, take the shot. The 5D is quick and locks on, I am never waiting for my focus, my thoughts should be on the photo I am taking not \"is my AF ready?\" Also in studio, the EFV is rough to use, I am more old school where I prefer to use the EFV over the back LCD. So when it is up in low light not only is AF slow but the viewfinder is very grainy, which is to be expected. Here is one thing that is odd to me, the A65 focuses worlds faster and is much easier to use in studio than the newer a7R, which I don't understand.In a well lit environment this camera is great, images are amazing and the AF works quickly and is accurate. Low light gives it some troubles. I am looking forward to using this more in studio and working to find some work arounds, taking this camera hiking with me and traveling.In comparison to my 5D this camera is better and worse. It is nice to have a smaller lighter camera that takes better pictures. The AF is slower and I am not yet to the point that I trust this camera for paying work. I use what I can trust all the time, the 5D.It might sound like I don't like this camera but the fact is that I love it, I have only used it for 2 weeks and it is growing on me fast. There are some things I don't like but it is a solid camera, feels very well built and I cannot speak enough about the image quality. Truly amazing! I don't regret this purchase at all.

Ramsey \"AMRamsey\"", "ReviewID": "R9MKAJXW8XPUL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If it is digital, I have probably used it. I began with a Sony CD Mavica MVC-CD200 2.1 Megapixel camera. Yeah, that was about 13 years ago. Since then, I have gone from the Olympus C-8080 to a Canon 20d to 30d to Nikon D2x to a Canon 5D II, III, Leica M9-P, Pentax 645D, and now finally at the a7R. There was some dabbling in between with 6x7 film, 4x5 film, 35mm film, but I always ended up back at digital due to the convenience. (I live 2 hours from the closest film processing option.) On a side note, I do hope film never dies, as I can see myself maybe going back to a 4x5 along with my current digital lineup. That being said, I am stunned by the quality of the files coming out of this sensor. I usually do not look at a camera anymore unless it is at least FF/MF and has no anti-aliasing filter. Ergo the Sony immediately caught my attention with its compactness and sensor features.I am primarily a landscape photographer, and I cannot put this thing down! I daresay I have had thoughts about selling the 645D due to its new potential as a costly paperweight, however I don't think I'm quite there yet. The sharpness is stunning when used with the Sony FE 55mm f/1.8 and the 24-70 is excellent as well. Sharpness rivals that of my M9-P and is as sharp if not sharper than my 645D. That being said, if I had to break this review down to my MOST favorite feature, I'd certainly have to go with DYNAMIC RANGE. This camera picks up so much micro-detail in photos AND the latitude you get in post is one of those things that cannot be described, only seen. Being a landscape photographer, I was always about multiple exposures in order to be able to combine the most amount of information into a photo in post-production. I am NOT one of those HDR fanatics who make images look like they were put out by Lisa Frank (don't ask me how I came up with that reference.) With the dynamic range of this camera, I can take one properly exposed image and get that HDR look I want with sliders in Lightroom instead of HDR Efex Pro II. Don't get me wrong, those plug-ins still serve a purpose. What I am telling you is I have yet to use it since buying the a7R.I do recall there being a lot of critique with regard to shutter vibration. I know a lot of heavy-hitting review/photography sites that explored this issue in LENGTH, with the forum comment pages stretching to the moon. Subsequent conclusions were drawn up to the effect of each side of the argument: It shakes. It doesn't shake. You WILL find evidence to support each viewpoint. Sheesh, I read so much on the issue that I even started to believe it myself after making this large purchase. But, I had to remind myself that this is simply a high resolution, FF sensor with no in-body stabilization. Basically, it is a film camera. Old rules apply here. To be cautious, I always use f 1/2x focal length AT LEAST on all my shots. If I'm on a tripod, I don't care what I use...I have used this camera both on and off a tripod, and I have only seen blurred images when I did not follow my own rule. I have not seen blurred images on a tripod yet unless my focus was off. When it comes to big sensors, focus MUST be precise as well. Spend time focusing a 4x5 wide open and you'll have a good idea about what precision is. For reference, I see the same blurring issue in my 645D when using slower shutter speeds while hand-holding the camera. This issue was not invented by Sony, but by photography.I will touch upon ISO a little here as I have hitherto had little experience with the a7R at high settings. I did take some photos recently of hotel rooms while testing out this baby without flash just to see what they looked like at 6400...the noise in the photos looked more like monochrome grain, and not that toxic pink blue red artifact-happy manure I am so used to in images taken with cameras that came out in 2009-2011. That helped in maintaining a very decent level of detail that is most certainly usable in professional applications, as well as being easier to eradicate.I guess I wouldn't be honest if I did not touch upon some of the things I wish were changed in the a7R.First, flash sync speed. I think 1/160 is a little slow for 2014.Second, I wish Sony had done more for weatherproofing. Coming from the 645D, I will have to be less brave with this one. While I always insure each individual camera, I'd rather not have to suffer a premiums increase because I put in a claim.Lastly, the button layout is the least \"function-oriented\" layout I have seen on a camera...but maybe that's to be expected with modern-day cameras.Oh, one more thing, I HATE having a green \"auto\" option on the top dial...makes the camera feel less professional, even though this is not the case.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "replaced my 5D MK II", "Author": "Eli J.

Photography is my hobby not my profession.  I have had several cameras over the years from a Canon T1i, to a Sony A55, to a Sony A77, to a Sony A7.  I have just replaced the A7 with an A7r.  I first bought the A7 thinking that the A7r was terrible at focusing.  I was able to try a A7r at the CES show.  I found that the focusing was really not an issue.  So I sold my A7 and got the A7r.FOCUSING - Focusing is really not a issue with me.  I have used the A7r  for a month now.  It focuses quickly in almost all lighting conditions.  The only time that it does not focus well is in pitch black rooms, but then there is nothing to take a picture off.  I took pictures of the interiors of homes with no flash and had no problems focusing.  I have taken pictures of fast action sports.  This camera is a little slow for that purpose, but you can prefocus on a spot and wait for the action.  This works great.  I had a hard time focusing on birds in flight (BIF) but did manage to get a few good shots (manual focus to infinity and capture the bird.)LIGHT LEAKS - I do not normally take long exposures with my lens cap on, so this has not been an issue with me.BATTERY LIFE - This is a weakness.  I have just bought several more batteries and carry them with me.  I have also bought a external charger.  I like the internal charger; this way I can charge two batteries at a time.  I normally drain 1 1/2 batteries during a day of heavy shooting.LENS - There are not many full frame e-mount lenses available.  If you buy the appropriate metabones adapter, just about any lens will work.  I have a TAMRON 18-200 lens (to get image stabilization,  sony has disabled this with their e-mount lens).  I get 15 mega-pixel images.  This is plenty resolution for me.  I also have the Zeiss 24-70 lens to use for high quality work.  And boy the detail really overwhelms me.  Since there is no anti aliasing filter the sharpness is great in the center of the frame.  Images are slightly soft at the corners but I like that.  It brings the viewer focus towards the center of the frame.SUMMARY - There is no perfect camera in all respects.  The Sony A7r is the closest that I have found.  It has excellent image quality for a great price (full frame comparisons).  I would highly recommend this camera to photography enthusiasts.  If you are a pro then I think that one for the Canikon cameras in the $5,000.00 price range may be a better fit.  I would recommend the A7r over the A7.  I have had both.

I spent an hour one the phone with the Sony Alpha rep., very pleasant but unwilling to directly acknowledge the problem, rather saying that their were photographers having good results. That is true, I also had them, but the camera is not consistent, it has a flaw.

I will not rehash what they have already addressed.  I will, however, set straight the lower reviews (3 and below).  There are some rather ludicrous comments that have little if anything to do with the potential and ambition of this camera.The one star review review below is nonsense.  The mere fact that Zeiss/Sony have not released \"enough\" lenses for this camera specifically is both inaccurate and neglectful of the real potential of this camera.  Zeiss/Sony already has a respectable selection of NEX lenses which will mount on this camera without an adapter.  True, you get the cropped view, but the lenses are available.  Moreover, it takes a lot of engineering to produce brand new spec lenses.  If you will recall, Fuji's X-mount lenses came out slowly.  So did the original NEX lenses.  And when Canon moved to the EF mount, it took about one year for the market to be saturated with a variety of focal lengths.Mirrorless cameras are popular for a very simple reason: they now have excellent image quality AND the ability to mount any lens you want.  If you have an old Voigtlander or Nikkor lens setting around, you can purchase an adapter and mount them on the A7r.  Same goes for Leica lenses, Canon, or practically any other lenses you have.  Just as importantly, if you haven't already devoted your money to a particular brand (Canon, Nikon, etc.), and don't really have lenses from prior SLR's, then you can still purchase relatively inexpensive lenses.  This gives you the freedom to purchase lenses that fit your particular shooting style.  For some, extreme wide and wide angle lenses are perfect, and will collect those lenses.  But that is to be said for any mirrorless camera.With respect to the relevant two star review, I empathize with the frustration.  In-body stabilization would have been fantastic.  Some other cameras have it, so why can't this one?  But in the end, what's the real harm?  Any photographer who has used film cameras never had stabilization other than a tripod.  The fact that the camera lacks internal stabilization is irritating but does not take away from the joy and quality of this camera.  It still produces beautiful photos.  I suppose you'll just have to be a more creative photographer and either place the camera on a stable platform or speed up the shutter speed.Finally, the three star reviews are mixed.  A few of them legitimately identify the vibration issue.  I personally have not run into this problem.  I cannot comment on this, other than to suggest you read those particular reviews.  A few other reviews suggest that the build quality of this camera is sub-par.  That is not true.  The A7r is an all-metal casing that is waterproof.  I'm not quite sure what these other reviewers are really after.  If they want a chunkier camera that feels more \"substantial\" in their hands, then perhaps a mirrorless camera is not for them.  Of course, if you throw this camera around, it will break.  Just as a 5Dm3, which is a tank.Overall, this is an amazing camera.  It is a significant investment, but one that may prove just right for you.  If you're already satisfied with your NEX camera, then you may want to wait a year.  If however you want a camera with more features, better image quality, and full-frame functionality, then seriously consider this camera.There is no doubt that other manufacturers will follow Sony's lead.  Some of those cameras will be as good (hopefully better than) A7r.  I say hopefully better because that will push innovation.  Lately Sony has done a very good job with taking the lead.  Their products aren't perfect (here, the shutter release is very loud and the focus is sometimes hit or miss), but there's no camera that is.  I'm not saying the A7r is a \"must buy.\"  If you are a professional or amateur photographer ready to move up to something new, you should consider this camera.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best camera at this time", "Author": "Alvaro Gaviria Cano", "ReviewID": "R38POMZKHJFM1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For me, the best camera in the worldMuch better than my old Nikon D800Light, smart, and full frame \u00a1", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony a7r pure awesome", "Author": "Joe Alarcon \"Joe Alarcon\"", "ReviewID": "R23K5SY9K4X4SQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony a7r and carol zeiss 35 glass, first 10 photos.

There is a lot of technical capability here but it is not a balanced set. A $500 conventional digital SLR is probably a more useful tool for indoor family photography.Separately, the green idiot mode makes ridiculous shutter speed/aperture choices. Indoors at a restaurant with a 35/2.8 lens it would choose 1/160th and f/2.8. So there was almost no depth of field (probably I would have chose 1/50th or 1/60th to stop camera shake and then stopped down the lens a bit).So it will be a great camera for hiking landscape photographers who want to learn the Sony user interface and use manual controls, but if you are willing to carry a little more weight and bulk probably something like the Nikon D610 is a better practical tool.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony a7R - Full frame and portable!", "Author": "Roberto Buttazzoni", "ReviewID": "R10V3AGF0Y04Z2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "High quality, good construction and well made camera!

The sensor is excellent, and a lot of detail can be pulled out of RAW images.  AF performance is generally (but not always) good.  High ISO performance is outstanding.The bad:  Build quality so-so.  Very loud and distracting shutter noise. Not as small as you might think. Weird green dots show up in some frames when you shoot into or near the sun. Not very many Sony Zeiss lenses available.The ugly:  Super-duper-fiddly menu-driven-controls, with endless sub-sub-sub-sub menus.  Incredibly easy to accidentally activate one of the seemingly endless menus while trying to take a photo. I do not know how many good shots I have missed because of this annoying and troublesome aspect of this camera.  Forget about the \"decisive moment\" with this camera. It might not happen because of its mysterious, illogical, overwrought and unintelligible menu-driven controls. Forget about using this camera under difficult environmental conditions (e.g., super cold weather) for the same reason. I took this camera to northern Minnesota recently and managed to get in one shot at -30 F before calling it quits and hauling out my Leica X1 for the rest of the trip.  IMHO, the control menus are a fatal flaw of this camera.Update months later:  Had the Sony Zeiss 24-70mm \"high end\" zoom lens for a few days and was unimpressed.  The image stabilization feature does not work very well, and distortion at the lower end (e.g., 24mm) is pretty pronounced.  Sharpness is not all that great either. That lens was sent back.  The 55mm Zeiss prime lens for this camera is one of the best lenses I have ever used (including Leica lenses).  I have obtained a few stunners with the A7R because of its sensor and the 55mm lens.  Unfortunately, IMHO the user interface on this camera is fatally flawed and really gets in the way of using the camera effectively.  The A7R operates more like a video game device than a camera. Even after extended use and gaining familiarity with the menu system over a period of months, the user interface still proved slow and needlessly time- and effort-consuming.  The poor user interface on this camera undoes all the excellence provided by the sensor and the 35mm and 55mm Zeiss lenses. I'll be selling my A7R camera and lenses in the next few days because of this serious shortcoming, and will spend the proceeds on a Canon 5D Mark III or on a Leica lens or two. I am quite disappointed by how the promise of the A7R turned out not to be a reality.Last update:  Sold the camera and took a bath. Someone who likes extended menu diving can now use the camera.

Or an instruction manual that actually covers some of the camera's functions? Or perhaps fewer JPEG presets (after all, this camera with lens is about $3,000 and virtually everyone buying a camera at that elevated price shoots RAW)?  Or maybe a quieter shutter (one of the first pictures I took was of my daughter -- after the shutter tripped she looked at me and said, \"What was that!\")?  And the autofocus is off just a bit in about one of four shots (it helps to turn off the autofocus light, I've found).  Color balance when shooting pictures in the snow isn't great either, as many have an odd greenish cast to them.One well-known reviewer has labeled the a7 version of this camera \"a toy\"  based on his comparison of image quality and color rendition with the Canon 5D Mk III and LEICA M type 240.  I certainly wouldn't go that far.  It's just got some surprising shortcomings that detract from the overall experience.  I think the next version might be worth waiting for instead.UPDATE:  Some have noted that the camera's instruction manual is lengthy (which it is).  Yet in all those pages there is not a single mention of how the different focus peaking levels work or even what they mean.  Same for the focus magnification feature.  Here's another example of the inadequacy of the user manual: The camera has a \"zebra\" function.  All the manual says about the zebra function is that it \"displays stripes to adjust brightness.\"  What does that mean?  Fortunately, dpreview included the following brief but helpful description of the feature in its recent review of the camera -- \"Shows a zebra pattern over parts of an image that exceed the brightness level you've chosen.\" C'mon Sony, would it be so hard to tell your users a bit more about how your camera actually functions?The more I use this camera the less I like the menu configuration. I think that despite its length and seeming completeness, the manual is completely inadequate.UPDATE #2:  Last weekend I took pictures of my daughter's birthday with this camera using Sony's HVLF20M external flash (the one recommended by Sony for this camera; why isn't there a built-in flash???).  The pictures were taken in normal house lighting, not dark at all.  When I went to look at them in Lightroom, I was surprised to see that the camera had automatically selected three different ISO levels for pictures taken back-to-back in essentially identical lighting conditions:  ISO 500, ISO 640 and ISO 2500.  The shots taken at ISO 2500 have a \"plastic\" look to them when viewed at 100% pixel size, with more noise than I would have expected.  Both the JPEG and corresponding RAW files display this same \"plastic\" characteristic in the images taken at ISO 2500.Many of the comments about this camera suggest that those who are not 100% pleased with it either (a) don't know how to use this camera, (b) haven't read the instruction manual, or (c) for some reason simply wish to bash Sony (after spending $3,000 with lens, go figure).  I am none of these.  I've used many cameras over the years, have read the instruction manual and have no arbitrary interest in bashing Sony.  That said, the more I use this camera the less I like it.  The menus must have been designed by someone in the video game department.  Great lenses and a superior sensor aren't enough at this price point.  The camera is only a tool to obtaining great images.  I've lost quite a few shots while fussing with the \"mysterious, illogical, overwrought and unintelligible menu-driven controls\" (as one Amazon reviewer has put it).  I regret selling my Nikon D7100 and lenses to finance this Sony.UPDATE #3:  I have sold the camera (at a considerable loss) and replaced it with a Canon EOS 6D. I really dislike the way the menu functions work on the camera and could not stand the \"plastic\" looking images it rendered sometimes, even in RAW.
