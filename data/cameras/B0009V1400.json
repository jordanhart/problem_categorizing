{"Reviews": [{"Title": "best camera ever!", "Author": "Krystal Hillsman \"genie\"", "ReviewID": "R3QY7UHL50EBUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third kodak camera and second digital one. I love the kodak line. The pictures have always come out great. I bought this camera to replace and upgrade my 2MP Cx7220, which I loved but scratched up quite badly while in Europe. It still worked fine but I decided to take the opportunity and upgrade.This camera is great. The LCD screen is pretty big for a camera this size. Much bigger than the Cx model. You can also adjust the brightness of the LCD screen to your liking or for certain lighting situations. You can set the screen to go off after a certain time period or not at all and comes right back on with a touch of a button.This camera is very easy to use (there is no need to read the manual to figure out how to use it--no frustration) and I love all the features it has. What I love the most of course is it's size. I really wanted a camera that I could take with me everywhere since I love taking pictures, but I didn't what to have to drag a big bag around with me to do so. This camera fits into my relatively small purse along with my wallet, a PDA, keys, pocket calendar, tissues, etc, everything I consider to be esstentials without making the purse hard to zip or bulky.The camera has several settings for just about any lighting condition, situation, and activity. And the pictures come out just as good on high zoom as they do on no zoom. You can also zoom in WHILE you take videos, a feature the Cx model, as well as a lot of other brand cameras do not have. To make room for more pictures you can lower the picture quality to 4.4MP, 4.0, 3.1, and 1.8. To conserve battery power (which is very good I must say) you can use the viewfinder which takes a picture of exactly what you see in the viewfinder, nothing is cut off.Another great thing about this camera is that it doesn't take a long time to boot up. You can take a picture a second or two after turning it on which can be very convenient.I love that this camera comes with a dock (for recharging and/or transfering) and a very nice one at that. It also comes with a photo printer dock insert, a wrist strap, and a carrying case. It's not the kind of case that will protect your camera if you drop it, which is find for me cause I keep it in my purse, and it's thin enough that it doesn't take up any extra room, while offering some protection from anything in my purse that might scratch it. (I really could have used a bag like this in Europe.)The only downside to this camera is that the internal memory does not hold very many pictures on the 5MP photo quality option. That is not too big of a deal since most people automatically buy memory cards for their cameras. I have a 512MB memory card and it hold 308 photos on the 5MP option, 344 on the 4.4MP option, 379 on the 4.0MP option, 469 on the 3.1MP option, and 757 on the 1.8MP option.There is also some editing that you can do right on the camera before you transfer it to your computer. The Kodak photo editing software is okay; it's basic and fun to play aroung with. I just use HP Image Zone and transfer the pictures using the camera wizard since I have XP. I had the software installed on my old computer but don't have installed on the one I have now because I didn't need it.In conclusion, this camera is well worth it's price and it has everything and more that a non-professional photographer could ever want or need. ^_^", "Date": "July 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "A very nice camera", "Author": "Digital Photographer \"Used to Like Nikon,s\"", "ReviewID": "R7OFZTW6NBHRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a very active photographer, all digital now, had quite a few digital cameras, some good, some not so good, never thought I would see the day I would buy a Kodak digital camera.Now that day has come. this little machine is really very impressive, beautifully made, a delight to use and constantly delivers very good photographs. I have put my other equipment aside and strictly stay with the Kodak, it is a joy to use.Now for some technical stuff, the flash appears is much more powerful then in the Kodak Specs. on most of these small cameras with large viewing windows you can still get blinded, not with the Kodak, you have an optical window, very few have that, it really is a necessity.I am very glad I purchased it, have no regrets at all, nice job Kodak.", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very good \"pocket\" camera with a great display", "Author": "71Stang", "ReviewID": "R253CY8LK7NTQU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you want a compact \"point-and-shoot\" camera that is one of the easiest to use and has a great 2.5\" display, then you can't go wrong with this one. I've had it for couple of weeks and have shot about 200 pictures under various conditions. The display is the best I have seen so far; and in my experience with digital cameras, the display is really important because you end up sharing more of pictures right there on the camera's built-in screen than any other way. (One other Amazon customer is complaining about the display. He must have a bad unit!).The pictures came out quite well for me too. The camera has lots of pre-programmed picture settings. I've tried most of them and they have worked quite well. Another thing that stands out on this camera is the build quality - which is excellent. Almost everyone of my friends who know cameras and who've handled this one, have commented about its high-quality touch-and-feel.There are two things to watch out for if you go for one of these slim, compact cameras: weak flash coverage and short battery capacity. On the former, this camera does very well. Just use the \"party\" setting. On the latter, it does NOT do very well. With the display on all the time, many on-off cycles, and lots of flash pictures, you'd be lucky to take 100 pictures on one charge. Normally, you would want the battery to last through a short (3-4 days) trip. This one may not. So, definitely buy a spare battery and keep it charged and with the camera.If long battery life is very important to you, then don't buy one of these slim cameras - of any brand. Go for the next bulkier class of cameras that use AA batteries. Also, if you want to shoot pictures often with manual settings (aperture, shutter speed, etc.) then go for something else - this camera is NOT intended for lot of manual control.To close, this camera is all about:  ease of use, great display, small size. If these are your top three requirements, you'll love this camera.", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "The future of cameras.", "Author": "Todd Brehm", "ReviewID": "R3OA503EZ19ZBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a trip to Disneyworld this past January, I realized it was time to upgrade from our Kodak CX7530.  It was our first digital camera, and was great.  However, there were some things lacking as far as features go.  So I started researching for a new camera and wound up with a V550.  One reason the V550 was top on my list is because it's a Kodak.  Now having owned 2 Kodak cameras, I can attest to their absolute ease of use.  The menus are extremely easy to navigate and very simple.  The camera as a whole is also simple to use.  Like the CX7530, I never picked up the manual for the V550.  I just started playing and withing 30 minutes was familiar with everything. The appearance of the V550 is very sleek and sophisticated.  I have the black model, and it's very sharp looking, more so in person.  When the blue light are lit on the top....nice!!  It has nice silver accents, and a matching black hand strap.The size is just right for me, compared to some of the more 'squat' cameras like the Nikon Coolpix line.  The camera also feels very solid, almost like it's made out of strong metals.  Our CX7530 didn't.  The battery/SD card compartment is now one, and has a much stonger sliding cover than the SD door on the CX7530.  I recently just started using all the features of Kodak's Easy Share systems.  From the camera, I'm able to mark photos to go into certain folders, be emailed or printed upon transfer.  VERY cool.  I also love the extensive range of modes on this camera, double that of the CX7530.  Overall, I'm EXTREMELY satisfied with this camera, and with Kodak as a whole.  So satisfied, we will be purchasing a second camera, the V570.Some of the things about our CX7530 I didn't like that has been improved on the V550:-Mode selection.  The CX7530 had a rotary on top to move between modes, and power.  This proved to take quite a bit of time switching between modes, especially if having to go past power (the lens would retract in and then back out).  The V550 has 4 'buttons' on the top of the camera (backlight in a gorgeous blue).  You use the buttons for auto, portrait, video, and the 'scene' modes.  Once in scene mode, you navigate with the directional arrows-no delays.-Video feature.  The video feature on the CX7530 was great-used it A LOT.  However, you couldn't zoom in and out.  So you'd have to stop the video, zoom, and start again.  Thus you end up with several short videos.  On the V550 you can zoom in and out DURING the video.  The V550 is also MPEG4.-Dock size.  The CX7530 had a rather large dock.  The V550 has a very small dock, about the circumference of a coffee can and takes up much less space.-Screen size.  The screen on the CX7530 was OK, but the screen on the V550 is positively HUGE.  This makes it very easy to take and also review photos and videos.-Camera size.  Like the screen, I didn't have much problem with the size of the CX7530.  The V550 though is much smaller, and is more convenient to put into a pants pocket.  It's so much smaller that I could keep 2 V550's in the camera case I had with the CX7530!!-Charging the battery.  On the CX7530 we had rechargeable Kodak batteries that recharged on the dock.  When we went to Florida, we had to take the whole dock because the AC cord didn't fit the camera.  Well, the AC cord for the V550 fits the dock AND the camera.  Also, the V550's buttons light up on the top as the camera charges-all four buttons and the camera is fully charged.Likes:Video Mode-zoom in/out, can make photos from video, camera automatically makes 7 photosScreen-HUGE and easy to see and viewScene Modes-the number of them and ease of getting to themExtras-different sounds (normal camera sounds/animal/music/sci fi), Burst mode (up to 5 photos in seconds), Easy ShareSize & Looks-convienent and great looking! LOVE the inset 'buttons' on the top that are also backlit in blue. Also small dock takes up less room.Software-pretty user friendly with useful editing toolsEase of use-Kodak is the reigning champion for the ease of operation in their digital cameras (and I've played around with other brands to compare)Blur indicator-After photo has been taken, an indicator appears telling you whether the photo was blurry or not.Image Stabilizer-Great feature available on the video setting.  Helps reduce the jerkiness of camera movements.Dislikes:Buttons-The top buttons are a wee bit difficult to push, though I think this will get better as I get more used to them.  The directional arrows and ok buttons are also rather small, making it difficult (though not impossible) to use.Video photos-the 9 photos the camera automically takes from video show up as a thumbnail sheet vs 9 individual photos. Also making photos from video is very tidious as you have to advance frame by frame from the beginnging.  You can't just take it from any point.Battery life-I knew the battery life wouldn't be great before I got the camera, so I'm not faulting it.  But if battery life is important to you, this may not be the camera for you.  Using the camera for setting up options, and playing with ALL of the options, I managed about 2 hours of battery life before the flashing battery icon came on (camera didn't die).  Our CX7530 had excellent battery life.  We are just simply going to purchase a couple back up batteries, and that's fine for us.Image Stabilization-There is no image stabilization available for photo modes.  I really think this is a sellable feature for cameras.  We both have shakey hands, and this feature would help a lot.Overall, I love my new camera.  If you are an everyday, amateur photographer, this is a GREAT camera.  Size, features, price, ease of use-you can't go wrong.  For those wanting some a bit less expensive, check out the V530.  Or for a bit more there's the V570 with wide angle lens.  And the upcoming V630.  You won't go wrong with Kodak!", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "So Compact, but it doesn't lack on the Features!", "Author": "Ryan Lynch", "ReviewID": "R1OC2FP66UEJCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just picked up this little gem of a camera today, and Wow am I impressed. I've always been a fan of the Kodak line of cameras, but they were always too big and bulky to carry around comfortably all day.Until the new v550 made it's way in.This thing is so compact! The screen is gorgeous, buttons are well laid out and i love the touch sensitive illuminated buttons on the top of the camera.So many Scene Modes to choose from, Great Optics, and believe it or not, amazing video w/ sound as well.The Camera does have 32mb of Interal Mem. but I'd highly recommend picking up at least a 512mb Sd card, or heck go with the 1gb, and you'll never have to worry about running out of pictures. The 32mb will get you about 20 pics at the 5mp setting.You can also adjust the resolution on the camera: 5.0mp, 4.4mp,4.0mp,3.2mp etc... In reality it's like your getting 4 cameras in one!The Photo Frame Dock is cool, Your all-in-one charging station and computer syncing station. All one button operation.Kodak has a winner w/ this line of incredibly compact cameras, and I hope there future cameras continue to follow this trend.pick one up today, and you'll see what I'm talking about!", "Date": "August 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good But Not Great", "Author": "J.

My dilema was that my Olympus was bulky and slow but took great photos (day and night).  I wanted something small without compromising image quality.  After reading several reviews I decided to purchase the Kodak V550.  Overall, this is a good camera.  I love its small size, ease of use and fantastic 2.5\" LCD.  Picture quality is generally good although the low light performance of the camera is unimpressive and the range of the flash is limited.  Some of my photos were overexposed due to closeness of the flash or high contrast due to the sun.  The video performance is good, no complaints there.  Battery life is low so buy a backup.  The good news is that an extra battery will only cost you $25.Bottom line is that this is a good camera but not a great camera.

It is not as sexy as the Sony Cybershot DSC-T7 but the Kodak V550 sure take much better pictures then the Sony. Both cameras have weak flash for taking indoor pictures, but what more do you want from a camera in this size. Both cameras have worst then average battery life.

McMillan \"CMcMillan\"", "ReviewID": "R3VBSVU3PEI1UJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a general snapshot camera for work (I take photos of whiteboards with diagrams), after-work fun, and family events.  I use some photos to publish on the web or use for company websites so good, crisp graphics for web-display was important.  Also, the camera needed to be very small and portable to keep in my pocket and available.I was not impressed with the Canon Elph digital I borrowed from a friend, nor was I pleased with a Sony Cybershot camera my wife has.  Both were soft or had digital artifacts that I didn't like.  I had an older Kodak DC240 that took better photos for the web.  So, I went with Kodak again for image quality and I have not been dissapointed.Other considerations were that made this tiny camera appealing were the real viewfinder, good quality glass lens, and metal case.It's not perfect but it's as close as I've found.  The 2.5\" screen is a little blurry or 'soft' to me.  It's not as sharp as any other 2\" screen I've seen.  My guess is they just use 2\" software to enlarge the viewing image, thereby losing a little clarity.  No big deal to me.One bonus feature I didn't think of was the video capturing.  It's outstanding and almost as good as a digital camcorder.  It's not great in low light but otherwise it's fantastic and impressive.  You can zoom while shooting video, the audio is great... it's just amazing to me.The only issues I have with using this camera (and may be remedied with a phone call to Kodak or by reading the manual)... are: When you want to review images, the camera defaults to 'favorites' mode.  Kodak assumes you want to categorize your favorite images and that's all you want to review.  This is a poor assumption in my opinion... and I think Kodak is going too far with its 'Easyshare' proprietary system by making me adhere to their organization methods.  It's not a big deal, just a little annoying.  Also, I'd like to see a battery life meter so I know with more warning when the battery is going to die.  I'm spoiled by my cell phone. ;)By the way, when I first got this camera, it blinked out a few times and needed to be turned off and on to work.  It happened more and more and eventually would not operate.  [...] who only has a 10-day return policy... even for exchanges, defects, etc.  I should've bought from Amazon... oh well.  However, Kodak was great at turning around the repair.  I called, got an RA number shipped it, and had it back in a week.  No big deal.... and the camera works great... as it should've from the start.  Everything on it was a little quicker, tighter, and better... and of course no weird problems either.Anyway, I highly recommend this camera to anyone.

My father and sister both have Kodaks and recommended them.  So after researching the v550 and seeing that it got good reviews I bought it as it met my requirements--compact, point and shoot, and no shutter lag.I am very happy with the camera.  It is very easy to use, and my pictures have come out great.  I take most pictures on the auto setting which is truly point and shoot.  There are many other settings such as candlelight, beach ect.  I used the beach setting and it took great pictures as well.I have not had any trouble with indoor low light pictures--when using the flash they have come out just fine.The only difficulty I have had is taking pictures of a dance show in the evening.  I could not get a sharp picture.  I don't know if it was the movement or the lighting, but I couldn't get a decent picture.Another nice feature is that a symbol comes up after you take a picture letting you know if the picture came out or not.  You know right away if you should retake the picture.The display screen is large and has great resolution.Also, the viewfinder came in handy on our vacation when taking pictures in the bright sunlight.I like the kodak easyshare system which makes it very easy to email pictures or to upload pictures to the kodak website and then send invitations to friends to view the pics.Also, once pics are uploaded to the kodak website, you can order prints online with the option to pick them up at your local CVS or have them delivered.I can only judge this camera from a total amateur's perspective, but is really easy to use, really easy to carry, and takes great pictures.  The ease of use comes in handy when asking passerbys to take a picture of you.The one problem some people could have is that the buttons are very small.  Its not a problem for me as I can use the tip of my fingernail, but could be for big hands, stubby nails.

The only drawback I have encountered is not so umch with the camera as with Kodak.  The rubber USB / A/V port cover fell off and got lost after only 2 months.

I knew right away that the cover was a poor design.  I contacted Kodak.  They gave me a name of a company in Illnois (I am in NJ!) that I can send my camera to for repairs.  Very nice, but I do not want to send my absolutely-working-fine camera 1200 miles away so they can pop in a new rubber USB cover.  They do not mention reimbursing my shipping cost, either.

Maybe the pictures do come out dark in indoor places but it isn't 100% of the time (Just clearing up all those other reviews). Maybe 50% and if they do, you can easily take it again or just enhance the picture making it brighter. Pictures do come out great.

I chose the V550 because I wanted a Kodak that's small with a huge 2.5\" high resolution LCD.  The video is great at 30fps.  One of my favorite features is being able to make a still photo from any video frame.  None of my pictures have that red eye problem...a problem that plagues many cameras this size.  The glass Schneider-Kreuznach lens produces clear, crisp photos.  This camera is lightning quick.I love the cool blue lights on this camera.  The dock is a neat way to show off your camera with the slide show and charge the battery at the same time.I highly recommend this camera.

I tend to carry it more often so I am less-frequently without the camera when a good photo opportunity arises.Minus:1- The software takes over your PC and is not flexible to use.2- The camera's video is a proprietary format (Quicktime) and Kodak does not provide software to save or convert the videos to a more standard format that can be burned to a CD or DVD and viewed on a DVD player.  I had to spend over $50 on 3rd party software that is difficult to use and it is a pain to have to do the extra conversion step with each video.3- Kodak does not support the most popular printers in my office (HP color 2500).  It seems they want you to buy their printers even if you already have a printer that is superior.Because of these closed-system, incompatibility issues, I rated the camera package and Kodak LOW.- If you are advanced and can support yourself with other software, it is a great camera.- If you are a beginner and want to just buy all Kodak compatible stuff and have Kodak software always running on your PC, it is also great.- I really dislike that, to allow use of this software, Kodak forces a user to have the software launch on their PC.

The camera has a very large and bright LCD display.  There is also a small optical viewfinder, but you will never use it with the bright display that works well even outside.  The camera has lots of preprogrammed modes, which are easy to access.  This makes it easy to switch from normal to inside party mode.  Like all of my previous Kodak cameras, it is very easy to operate and takes very nice quality pictures.Picture quality is very good.  Being such a small pocket camera the flash is not very powerful which is driven by how small it is.  You either need bright light indoors or be close to your subject.  You can play with a lot of options from ISO settings to burst mode.  The camera also analyses the image after each shot and gives you a green/yellow/red indicator in the corner of the preview mode of how much blur is in the image.  When you are in a busy situation, it is a nice indicator if you possibly should consider retaking the picture.  You can also even crop the image within the camera which makes it much easy later when you upload the pictures and makes you look like a pro, but the original image in the memory in case you get carried away.The V550 records videos with sound in either 640x480 or 320x240.  I use a 1GB card and use the fully 640x480 mode which records at 30fps and is QuickTime compatible. I can get about 30 minutes of video.  It is compressed very well with very little issues of quality.  Action videos of my son's hockey are very nice as long as I lock down the focus. Compared to my older Kodak DX6490, the increased resolution is very nice as a trade off for the decrease from 10x optics from the DX6490.  You can change the zoom during the recording and the recording length is only limited by the amount of memory and the battery.  The camera also generates a 9 picture (3x3) matrix of thumbnails showing a time-lapse of the video just recorded.  It is stored in memory right along with other JPG pictures.  It is a nice picture to put in your album in case you can't grab images from the QuickTime movie.Being a very small camera, it also has a very small battery.  Plan on buying a second battery.  I even have a third now for long trips or numerous hockey games in a single day.  Between the shelf life from the time you charge the unit to when you use it, as well as the actual drain from the camera from compression and flash usage, the battery is going to run out on you.  You can get a lot of standard pictures like for a party on a single battery, only if you charged the battery a few days before and you don't run a lot of videos.  The charger is a travel charger too.  It is used to power the base unit, but can be unplugged and plugged directly in the camera while on a vacation.I give this 4 stars for the quality of the 5MP pictures, the ease of use, sexy style, overall size, and nice pedestal docking station.  It would have gotten 5 stars if the battery lasted longer and the flash was a little more powerful.  I do love this camera.", "Date": "January 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nifty camera but go with the V550, not the 530...", "Author": "Ranger Pat", "ReviewID": "R212MC6KQXXXFT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "...because the LCD screen on the 550 is magnificent. The camera itself is about the size of a deck of cards and the screen fills much of that space. Easy to scroll thru the menu for the gazillions of options. Yes, you need a steady hand when not using the flash; however, I disagree that the pictures are dark. When you download thru Easyshare software and edit a picture, just choose 'enhance' if it seems dark and the result will be excellent. Also, the video is sharp...and it's helpful to have such an inconspicuous video camera. If you keep the camera charged on the dock I don't think a second battery is needed, either.

I also have been able to take some amazing pictures in a short period of time. The scene modes work very well. I have tried about every special setting to my satisfaction. The sports setting works great, no blurry pictures, even with my sons playing and running around. The auto setting works well in about every situation. It is almost impossible to take a bad picture with this camera.Taking scenic pictures is easy as well. I was riding my bike on the local bike trail and caught some great pictures of a train crossing a bridge. I was riding fast while taking the pictures, not very smart, but they turned out great.I have read many reviews stating that the battery life on the V550 is poor. I have not noticed this problem. I have taken up to fifty pictures, including video, and the low battery indicator never showed up. I will be purchasing an additional battery for vacations, but I will not need it for ordinary use.The camera dock is convenient and easy to use.

I take lots of indoor pictures which most of the time turn out pretty dark unless I have it super bright in my house, but that isn't very often. I tried to take pictures at my son's kindergarten graduation in his classroom, but it was too dark to get even one shot. I had to get video of him to be able to see him at all. Not so great for kids in motion either, they are blurry.Video option is great though. I guess I use this option most on my camera. I have had this one about a year, and I am going for a canon with IS (image stabalization) now. I will retire this camera to my husband.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Lens Brakes easily", "Author": "Dogmata", "ReviewID": "RXMP0B2JDH7JV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this camera worked well, until the lens stopped working one day. now it just makes a grinding noise. from looking online, this is a common problem. the outside is metal, but the gears inside are just soft plastic.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor Design and Even Poorer Customer Service", "Author": "faisca", "ReviewID": "R3FCNM5Y9OPTH0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "LOVED this camera until it broke one year later.

Sutphin", "ReviewID": "R3KQD3KZNJG5IS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought the Kodak Easy Share V550 about a year ago because I need the simplest most dependable camera I can find.  Up front, I need to say that I'm pretty much a complete idiot when it comes to photography. While my husband, who is an amateur photographer has gotten some pretty good photos, my experience has been hit and miss.  I find the teeney tiny buttons, some just pressure pads, difficult to use.  Also, I don't think the icons clearly indicate the button function.  The main selection button on the back has so many options, its staggering.  I will say that the warranty service is very good.  The LCD screen wasn't working properly and there were some other problems.  I contacted the service center listed at the Kodak website and received promptly friendly replies.  Camera was sent off, repaired and returned without any charge to me other than the initial shipping. UPDATE: The camera worked okay for only about 2 months and since then I've had nothing but trouble.  Battery freshly and fully charged, but camera freezes after 2-3 photos - lens won't retract, camera won't turn off - have to remove battery to get camera to shut off and lens retract.  Recharge, start over, same thing happens.  Can't turn LCD screen on to use instead of view finder.  Handbook says just press the main control button - no help.  Sister-in-law has an earlier version of Easy Share and loves it.  She can't figure the V550 out either.  Something is very wrong here - I'm guessing there is something wrong with the circuitry.  Apparently, there is a quality control issue, as some people seem to have had great experiences with the V550 and others, like me unfortunately, have had very bad experiences.  I paid over $300.00 plus accessories and only got a few dozen so-so photos.

However there a few things I did not like.  The power button is flush with the camera and very small making it difficult to power on. The battery does not last long at all.  I strongly suggest a second or third battery.  Most importantly, I rec'd the camera and the 1GB SanDisk Ultra SD memory card.  I inserted the card and assumed it was working.  Upon using the camera for about 25 pictures I got a message saying internal memory was full.  Trying to access the SD card via the menus gave me a \"No memory card insterted error\".  The card works fine in other cameras, and in an external card reader.  I called Kodak, who stopped just short of asking for my first born in exchange for them admitting that their camera was the problem. They informed me the camera would have to be sent in for repair or replacement AT MY EXPENSE.  They said if it had to be replaced, it would be replaced with a refurbished unit.  I of course told them that I refuse to pay shipping on their defective product, and would return it for another brand before doing so.  They simply responded that it was my choice to do so.  So I called Amazon.  Let me just say that Amazon customer service was incredible and Kodak should take note.

This one was lighter, smaller, with larger view screen.  The movie is much higher quality, and you can zoom while filming (though at times the zoom sounds like loud scratching on metal on playback, other times you hardly notice even if there's no other background sound).Unfortunately, it has terrible battery life.  This is a fatal flaw; whatever else a camera may offer, if you can't use it when you need it, it's garbage to you.  I have missed a ton of shots due to discovering my camera was dead, or having it die on me while I'm out with it.  Contributing to the problem is that kodak doesn't given a charger (as it did with my prev camera), you have to charge the whole camera, meaning even if you go buy a second battery, how are you going to charge it if you don't also buy a second charger?  Also compounding the problem is that the 7440 accomodated a larger backup, so you could get double life with it; this one takes only a second one the same size, which, as mentioned, is inadequate.Secondly, this camera seems to have a lot of problems with it's zoom.  I had to send mine in for factory repair after 5 months of use; it no longer retracted.  There are posts all over the internet about it.  Missed all the holiday photo opportunities due to this problem; again, if a camera isn't there for you, all the other features are meaningless.Feature-wise, I thought 3x zoom was way too limiting, and odd given the current state of technology, but buyers know this going in, so I guess one can't really complain about it.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera !!!", "Author": "Eduardo", "ReviewID": "R1Y8JMEEQRM9LP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Kodak digital  camera, I love it.

You have to have a very steady hand if you want the pictures to come out good, and that's if the subjects aren't moving.

Frankly, that's not enough to seduce a real photographer to own one of these tricky gagits.  The photo quality was not as good as my old 3.1 Kodak Easy Share product.  The indoor shots were often off color because of the not as powerful flash.  Outdoors, the colors were hit and miss. I did not experience any workmanship problems with the unit, although, one day is not a real test for longevity and quality.One day was enough for me to recognize I should try another digital product.  I currently have the Nikon Coolpix 7900 now and I am very impressed with its capabilities.  My Nikon photos look richer, have greater detail and seem to be acceptable, for a point and shoot travel camera.Naturally, if I want to take \"real\" photos I will still use my 1975 Minolta 35 mm SLR camera that takes pictures that can't comepare to these digital things....One more thing to consider about this Kodak...its very slim and can easily fall out of your grip if you are not aware of it...I think if it hit the cement ground a couple of times...it would be a pile of aluminum and plastic!  The Nikon is much easier to hold on to....and all the complaints about low light focusing problems have yet to materialize in my experience.

This would not matter so much except for the fact that the picture quality is not great either. Indoors, outdoors, nighttime, anywhere, the pictures are fuzzy. As I said earlier, I have gotten it fixed twice in the past month alone, which does not include the other three times plus the time I exchanged it for a new one. Even after all this the camera still does not work. I even have friends who were misled by the reviews and bought this camera, and guess what, they all say the same thing, that this camera is bad.
