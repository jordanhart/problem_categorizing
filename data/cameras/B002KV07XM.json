She loves pink and takes reasonable pictures on my very expensive Canon.  I put the camera together with batteries and 2GB Flash Memory Card, wrapped it, and hoped for the best.  I believe this camera was the perfect item to promote my GD's natual ability.  She opened the package and with in minutes was snapping fairly good pictures.  The camera is easy to operate, comes with it's own software.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Expect An Unpleasant Surprise With This One", "Author": "Book 'Em Danno", "ReviewID": "RTQVXFIH8EF6R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a gift so it went straight to the recipient.  When the recipient showed me this camera I was in shock!  The camera was definitely not worth any price over $10.00.  The view screen was extremely small, your camera subjects will look like ants.  The quality of the picture was grainy and dark.  Even the feel of the camera felt cheap.  There's a difference between a lightweight camera and just plain old poor material.I have since apologized to the recipient of this gift for the poor quality and mailed it back to Amazon as quick as I could.  Do not waste your money on this, if you're going to buy a digital camera there's a much better selection out there.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really", "Author": "Kick_Rocks", "ReviewID": "RRBVX2FI250N0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I first bought this camera back in 2010, I thought this was a good investment.. Boy was I wrong.. For one the shipment was late, the camera was too small then advertised, it took okay photos.. But would constantly freeze up which ended up erasing all data on the memory card.. The seller.. Not much to say about them.. Other wise I would not recommend this product nor the seller due to the lack of quality.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "adequate if it works", "Author": "Andrew R.

Found it adequate - small, acceptably easy to use, and it made acceptable photos (note: with some vignetting in all photos.)  But I'm giving it a 2-star leaning toward a 1-star,  as (1) it doesn't work easily with older Macs.  (Software/set-up is all PC-focused, and I had to jump over a few computer hoops to get the pictures to download to a pre-intel Mac) and (2) defective. After 100 photos or so (and careful handling) mine now turns off immediately on start-up.  Did a google, and it's not an uncommon problem, yet the Vivitar website/'solutions' page has no suggestions on correction.It took acceptable photos for $35, but a 1 month life-span (even for such a cheap camera) makes it too disposable to recommend.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Features: Self Timer, Auto Focus, Digital Image Stabilization, Color TFT LCD Screen\nZoom: 8.0 X Digital , 0.
