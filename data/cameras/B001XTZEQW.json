Hill \"CFH\"", "ReviewID": "R7JY11CC6M1WG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Wide Angle Fish Eye Jelly Lens is a fun attachment for your small cell phone camera or pocket video camera (i.e. Creative VADO or Flip Ultra). It does significantly increase the field of vision of the existing lens, but the distortion is also significant. This is a fairly fun effect for the first few minutes and it might let you get a reference shot that would otherwise be missed, but doesn't really lend itself to much day to day practical use.The lens is attached to your camera via a sticky ring and it can be put on and taken off very quickly without leaving any residue. It is useful to have the camera on and view the placement on the LCD to make sure the lens is properly placed and not obscuring the existing lens.This might not be for everyone but it is small and fairly inexpensive so I carry it with my small camera just in case I ever find a use for it.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "Jose A.
