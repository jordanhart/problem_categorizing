{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great camera", "Author": "Bob C", "ReviewID": "RNR32IWP9FMLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only drawback to the full kit is the telephoto and wide angle lens kit isn't worth it.  Still, the camera is magnificent and the two lenses are great and the rest of the kit is good.  So, I love the camera, and most of the kit, but will knock off a star for some cheap glass.  Cameta camera was very helpful, too.  And I would, and have, ordered from them since.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,319.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 13 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Olympus OM-D E-M5 Micro 4/3 Digital Camera & 12-50mm Lens (Black/Black) + <2> Olympus M.Zuiko 40-150mm Lens + <3> Precision Design PD-C20 Digital Camera/Camcorder Case +\n<4> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card + <5> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <6> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter +\n<7> Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod + <8> PD 2.5x Tele & .45x Wide Lens + <9> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<10> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <13> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Olympus OM-D E-M5 Micro 4/3 Digital Camera & 12-50mm Lens (Black/Black) with M.Zuiko 40-150mm Lens + 32GB Card + Case + Filters + Tripod + Telephoto & Wide-Angle Lens Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5198v-N50OL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00822FCX8"}}
