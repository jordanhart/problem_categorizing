{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "jjrose", "ReviewID": "R3G69UO0I1JQQJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I fell in love with this relatively inexpensive little digital camera and used it for a couple of years before I lost it.  I tried replacing it with a Fuji and, well, there was a cheap little camera in every sense of the word.  Then I saw this one used for a third of the price and I was assured that if it didn't work right that as usual Amazon and the seller would be standing behind it - so I bought it and am so happy with it.  It is a great little camera - when I went through the menus, etc. with the Fuji it felt like a toy - this camera feels professional - easy to understand- and the look and the feel is quite elegant.  I admit as I was looking to replace this when it got lost and I looked for another, I read reviews saying this is not a good camera - I strongly disagree - that was a review that made me wonder what they were looking at.  I assure you this is a fine little camera.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Polaroid 12MP Ready-to-Use Digital Camera bundle includes a CD-ROM software, USB cable, wrist strap, and 2 batteries.\n12 Megapixels allows for pictures with sharp detail; 2.7\" Color LCD screen for previewing images before you shoot\n3x Optical zoom; 5x Digital Zoom; 32 MB built-in storage\nAnti-Shake Image Stabilization, and Face-Tracking for perfect faces in your picture.\nSmile and blink detection; Red-Eye Removal; PictBridge compatible", "Name": "Polaroid 12.0 MP Digital Camera i1236", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41K3n9qxItL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004LLCTLM"}}
