I decided to hold out for a zoom lens and at least 1024 x 768 resolution, or wait.  After a lot of  research, I knew I wanted an Olympus, because of their excellent optics and  their camera-first, digital-device-second approach, and because my Olympus  35mm point-and-shoot had served me well.I thought my best deal would be  on a used or discontinued model; however, because the original price of the  500L, 600L, and 400Z had been so high (in the $800-1200 range), the asking  prices for these had not come down as much as I'd hoped, and what I had to  be willing to pay had crept up as I shopped.  When I saw what the 450Z was  going for, I whipped out my credit card.  Now that I've played around with  it for a few weeks, I can't imagine there's a better digital camera for the  money right now.  I've compared with a couple of friends that have Nikon  CoolPix cameras, and I suppose there's something that's better about them,  but I can't honestly tell you what that would be, and the Nikon is twice  the money!The 450Z is an improved version of the well-received 400Z, but  at a radically lower street price.  Some of this is due to the packaging --  the 450Z leaves out the FlashPath floppy adapter (typically $70-90 alone)  that was standard in the 400Z -- but clearly the manufacturing costs are  coming down rapidly.This camera performs incredibly well on the  bottom-line measurement:  It takes stunningly detailed and accurate  pictures under a wide variety of conditions.We've gotten used to  accepting less than perfection for pictures taken in other than bright  sunlight at normal distances.  The 450Z adds several categories of  picture-taking where you can now get predictable results:  Flash, macro  (including with flash), indoor lighting, low light, etc.  There are just  enough features to make the camera useful over the range of conditions, but  not so many as to intimidate the snap-shooter.  Because of the intelligence  of the autofocus, exposure control, and white balance, it is still a great  point-and-shoot camera.Many features are related to getting the picture  right at the right resolution, such as spot metering, exposure override,  mode (resolution), different flash modes, macro, etc.  Other features are  related to viewing and managing the pictures you've taken.  You can plug  the camera into a VCR or TV monitor (RCA video jack) and give a quick  slideshow of what's in memory.  You can get around the small size of the  LCD display (and this is one of the better ones) by zooming in on one  segment (out of a 3 x 3 grid) of an image, to make sure the detail is  there.One other feature that other reviewers have found important:  The  450Z will store images uncompressed, if you choose (the file size is huge);  most other cameras up to this point perform at least some compression, even  on high-quality settings.The only thing I couldn't do well -- and this  may just take some practice -- is action shots.  All digital cameras have  some lag between the time you decide to pull the trigger and the time the  image is committed to memory, and this takes some getting used to, but the  450Z is quicker in this respect than its earlier counterparts.  One  significant feature is the \"burst mode\", which allows you to keep  capturing images (about 1-2 a second) as long as the shutter button is  pressed, and until the buffer fills up (seems to be about 6-10  images).Most of us get into digital because of the cost and overhead of  dealing with film and processing, only to have to scan prints or pay extra  to the processor for digital images from film.  Depending on resolution,  you can get up to 122 images onto the standard 8MB memory card before  unloading, and that's very liberating -- no more agonizing over whether to  take another shot!  However, once you play around with it a while, the mind  starts to boggle at the possibilities, and film cameras seem like Stone-Age  technology (especially since we are approaching the resolution of film with  the million-plus pixels you can store in an image now).The 450Z is a  milestone in the improvement of digital cameras, a quantum leap in value  vs. features and quality, even compared to other Olympus cameras.  You  won't believe how easy it is to get breath-taking digital photos.  Get one!", "Date": "November 2, 1999"}, {"Title": "Photo-Snappin' Grandma", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1FKQAQG4WVOEZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased the 450Z after a lot of research, have had it for a couple months now and absolutely LOVE it.  Agree with other comments on slow (frustrating) D/L speed using the serial cable, and definitely recommend  the FlashPath reader.  Before you jump to buy a cheaper camera, take into  consideration the features that the 450Z offers that, even if you're a  novice, you'll probably not want to live without, i.e., optical zoom, 8MB  memory card included, and photo settings usually found only on high-end  cameras (overcast conditions, fluorescent lighting, etc.)  One of the best  features I used this week was the ability to take great photos of my  newborn grandson on the delivery table with the flash OFF!  Auto  shutter-speed compensated for the flash off and produced extraordinary  photos!  All digicams are battery hogs, but I was able to take about 120  photos (med res) before replacing them (I rarely use the LCD monitor, and  never use battery power for D/L'ing pics).  You MUST read the manual from  cover to cover before using the camera for the first time, but now I only  refer to it when using a setting I don't normally use.  AC/DC port is not  standard and I was forced to get a converter from Radio Shack that has  several different adapter plugs (cheap).  PhotoShop Home Deluxe s/w  included, but BEWARE -- make sure your PC video card drivers are  up-to-date.  Go to your PC-makers website and D/L the latest updates before  installing this s/w.  I had major conflicts with the video drivers req'd by  PhotoShop and the 18-month old drivers on my Gateway.  All in all, I am  extremely satisfied with the 450Z.  The only improvements I'd recommend to  Olympus is replacing the serial D/L connection with a USB compatible one,  making the camera a little more user-friendly so the manual is not so  indispensable, changing the AC/DC input to something more standard, and  include a FlashPath adapter with the camera.  Unless you abhor reading  manuals and instructions, you won't go wrong with this camera.", "Date": "December 10, 1999"}, {"Title": "Could Not Be Any More Pleased!", "Author": "Peter Shaddock", "ReviewID": "R3C6EM190BTPQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am one who always jumps into new tech stuff during the first or second wave.  I have been holding off on a digital camera purchase for more of a value reason than anything else.  When I saw this camera loaded with  features combined with my experience with Olympus, I knew I was time to  buy.  I was still slightly fearful that the process from taking shot to  downloading it to my harddrive would be cumbersome; however, this was not  true. The software that comes with this camera is powerful yet straight  foward and easy to use.  The images are great and a lot of fun to have  instantly.  IT WORKS JUST LIKE A GOOD AUTO FOCUS 35MM.Cons:  Uses  batteries quick if you use the LCD and during the download to PC process.  It takes a long time to download a 8mb smartmedia card (30-40 pics @ medium  quality).  It does not come with a case.  The LCD is just below the optical  eye opening so your fat nose smudges the LCD screen everytime you take a  picture.FINAL WORD:  BUY IT  --- IT'S GREAT along with:  1.  Case  2.

Get NiMH batteries, for sure,  but you can use it without the screen and save power.  Also, Olympus sells  (and you can get it here at Amazon) a PCMCIA adapter for the SmartMedia  cards, which pretends to be a spare hard drive.  Cool!

I purchased it because itis more like a \"real\" camera than other digicams I haveseen.  I like being able to choose \"film speeds\" and aperature settings as on a 35 mm.  This is my first digital camera, so it took a couple days to get used to all the controls.  However, the camera takes great pictures on fully-automatic mode, so you can start taking snapshots right away.  I also found that pictures in daylight turn out much sharper than night-time flash photos.  Maybe I just need more practice with the flash settings.I would recommend rechargeable batteries (I purchased the less-expensive Kodak NiMH batteries instead of the Olympus brand).  I would also highly recommend a USB SmartMedia card reader (if you have a Mac or Windows 98).  I bought a Fuji USB reader, and it makes transferring your photos to your PC a snap.  It was easy to install, and it appears as a removable drive in Windows Explorer.  So I just use Explorer to cut and paste from the card to my hard drive.The software is also pretty good.  The panorama stitching software looks pretty cool, but I have yet to test it out.\"Every time you close the lens cover, it hits the lens.\" Not so.  You close the lens cover to the half-way point, the lens will retract, and then you fully close the cover.  Second, \"You have to turn the camera off in order to preview your pictures on the LCD.\" Again, not true. You can leave the lens cover open, and \"double-click\" on the display button.  This allows you to preview your pics on the LCD.", "Date": "December 20, 1999"}, {"Title": "Great camera is getting better!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1S4S3CS4Q4DE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In a previous review I stated we purchased this camera before Christmas and had excellent results.  We used only the automatic setting and it produced outstanding results without flash.  This has turned into an outstanding camera for my wife, who refused to focus a 35mm.  Since  initial use we continue to be impressed with the features and flexibility  this camera gives us.  We have been able to produce great shots, and with  the ability to edit, enlarge etc. Several observations and  comments:This camera will eat batteries.  We purchased nicad  rechargeable, and are getting similar life compared to Alkaline.  Save some  money here.Purchase additional smart cards, (memory).  We purchased two  additional 16MB and have found that SHQ is the only way to go.  You can't  improve the quality once a picture is taken, but you sure can regret a poor  quality photo.We purchased Flashpath, and really don't use it.  We found  that the serial download is adequate.  NO, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO VIEW IN 5  MINUTES, but how many times will you need to?  A 16 MB (full of SHQ) takes  15-20 minutes to download.  I set it up, leave it and come back.  We are  blessed with extra drive space and have started designating a separate file  for each photo set. You can do this with Windows Explorer before  downloading.  You can delete the ones you don't like, and by naming the sub  files you create make it easy to locate and use pictures later.We  purchased Microsoft picture it 4.0.  For most purposes we find it much  easier to use than Adobe, and for the price very useful.  To sum up, my  wife originally told me,\" you take the pictures, I'll just tell you which  ones I want you to print\", BOY HAS THIS CHANGED.  The camera and software  are so easy to use that she is taking pictures, downloading, editing,  printing, AND TRANSMITTING FILES OVER THE INTERNET.  She was telling a  friend about an item she saw in a newspaper ad, She took a picture of the  AD, downloaded the picture, and sent it, all in less than 5 minutes.  We  have only touched the surface of what we can accomplish with this camera.

Rice \"kmrice2803\"", "ReviewID": "R3G5LSZGAMPF33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I joined the digital parade after an agonizing 6 months of comparison and indecision.  I liked the Sony Mavica features, especially the floppy disk method of storing images.  I've used my work's Mavica 91 and loved its  simplicity and great ability to take indoor pictures without a flash.  I  also loved the rechargeable 'smart' battery which Sony sells with its  product; it actually tells you how much time you have remaining before a  battery change is required.  It could also do short MPEG motion pictures -  with sound. The big negative:  it's huge and weighed a ton.  It's  resolution wasn't sufficient either.I finally ended up with the Olympus  450z because of its high resolution, its available floppy adapter, its many  features for the price, and its compact size -- its virtually identical to  my old 35MM model.  It takes great pictures, but isn't as capable in low  light conditions as the Mavica 91.The Panaroma picture capability was a  feature which I never thought of using -- until I saw the software demo  which was included with the camera.  It's like magic -- it puts together a  panarama of pictures into a single composite image.  Truly amazing.In  summary, the 450 is a great camera, albeit only slightly better than the  400 - and doesn't include the floppy adapter as the 400 did.  Great - yes,  but the price really hasn't dropped as I had hoped.  Finally, if you're  thinking ahead, you'll order 8 or 12 NiMH batteries and a recharger, a 16  or 32 meg SMART Card, and the Floppy adapter.  You've suddenly got yourself  a $700-$800 camera outfit.

I shoot mostly slides, adore my zoom and macro lenses and expect a lot from my images.  I was looking at the high end prosumer Olympus (C2000) and Nikon (950).  Drooling is more  like it.  Then I started reading reviews of the D450Z on  [...] and others.  Sounded like a near perfect  compromise.  While the images won't stand up to extreme enlargement, how  often do we really do that with our pictures.  I got the camera a couple  days before heading out on a trip and was delighted with how easy it was to  carry and use.  No more rolls of film to manage.  The images were sharp,  good color balance and I took night time images, hand held, without flash  that would stand up against commercial postcards.  The zoom isn't as long  as I'd like but you can't expect that of a point and shoot.  Get an extra  smartmedia card, NIMH batteries (though I did 56 pics on just over one set  of batteries - with the LCD on).  Olympus' new Smartmedia reader rocks.  Downloads become a matter of seconds.  I couldn't expect more from this  camera.  I'll still keep my SLR for those National Geographic trips but it  might be just a matter of time before it'll be replaced too.

It's loaded with features seen only on more expensive digital cameras (changeable ISO values, great low light capability, a true optical zoom lens with the ability to add 2X digital zoom on top...I could go on and on  about the *pros*.....there are so many!Here are the *cons* I've picked  up so far:1. Camera does eats its four AA alkaline batteries quickly,  especially if you use the LCD a lot. THE FIX: I purchased rechargeable 1400  mv NiMH Nexcells and a Maha C204F charger for under $40 online and neatly  solved this problem.2. Not the most intuitive menu and button system.  THE FIX: reading the manual before trying to use does help. A *quick guide*  sheet comes with the camera...keep it handy to figure out those features  you don't use often. Now I know how to use the features that are important  to me and don't have to refer to the manual any longer.2. Manual is  confusing with three languages/page. THE FIX: English is primarily on the  left-hand pages so look there first. Dog-ear the content index page so it's  easier to find what you are looking for later, and keep the one-page  \"quick guide\" that comes with the camera handy.4. If you are  going to take panoramic photos, ONLY THE ***OLYMPUS*** SmartMedia CARDS  WILL SUPPORT THIS FEATURE! If you purchase less-expensive brands like  SanDisk, you won't be able to take panoramas. THE FIX: Purchase Olympus  SmartMedia cards on auction sites or at bidding sites online...I bought my  Olympus 32 mb card for $45 under the Olympus website price.5. Slow photo  download rate. First of all, I didn't find the serial port download overly  slow, especially compared to other digital cameras. However, since camera  has to be on during the download, I recommend purchasing an AC Adapter  (doesn't have to be Olympus brand) to save on batteries. But if you're a  speed freak, then THE FIX: Purchase either the USB or FlashPath Floppy Disk  Adapter....either will speed up download time considerably.

The floppy adapter works well to transfer files to/from  the smartmedia card, and a usb smartmedia card reader works even better.

The other thing I love about it is that I can take night pictures with it.

Take it from me, I'm no stranger to digital photography. I was using my Sharp digital camcorder to take digital still pictures but I was not very impressed with the results. Moreover, a camcorder is too bulky to haul around. So I decided to go with a smaller camera. I did a lot of research before settling on the D-450 camera from Olympus. It is feature rich, looks very cute, and delivers pictures with a punch. It works effortlessly on my Windows XP. My favorite feature is the 3X optical zoom (digital zooms are generally useless). The LCD screen is crisp and clear, although it's use should be limited to preserve battery life (Use the LCD only to review already taken shots. Do not use it for taking pictures - use the viewfinder). The video output works great. I could go on and on. It's comnpatible with SmartMedia which, in my humble opinion, is the better storage medium.Overall, I am quite impressed with the D-450 Zoom. It's simply a wonderful camera. I wouldn't expect less from Olympus. Regarding complaints about lack of a USB port for downloading: Just get a SmartMedia card reader. A good card reader costs less than twenty dollars and simplifies your life a lot. I personally use PNY SmartMedia card reader but any good card reader should do. Not only does a card reader download your pictures at blazingly fast speeds, you also save your batteries by not using your camera to download the pictures.PS: If you are looking to save money, consider getting a refurbished camera. They come with a 90-day manufacturer's warranty and in most cases are essentially brand new cameras. I should know.
