Haven't used them alot yet, so can't tell if they'll last as long as the original. But on the surface, it looks like it was a great value buy as backup batteries. Very little downside I would think, so I would cautiously recommend this as worthwhile buy if you're looking for alternatives to the overpriced originals.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "cheap but they actually work in my nex7", "Author": "Gregfl \"Gregfl\"", "ReviewID": "R3JACWMESQOCJL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "They are much lighter than the stock battery of my nex7, but they charge right up and work.

I rated this item two stars because the image that the seller uses on Amazon does not reflect what I recieved. I own two Sony OEM batteries, and those batteries resemble those used in the sellers image. The replacement batteries are lighter in weight than the Sony batteries, as mentioned in a previous review.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony Nex5N replacement batteries", "Author": "jan \"rock 4 ever\"", "ReviewID": "R2T8ZGW5U8R8WC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the 2 pack of batteries as back-ups for my Sony Nex-5N.  The first one charged just fine and lasted as long as the original. I gave it to my friend with a Nex at a concert and told her to keep it.  The second one would not charge -- it was just dead.  I messaged Amazon and the seller sent a new battery within 2 weeks.  The new one is just fine and I alternate the two.  The Nex is very easy on batteries unless you use a lot of flash (which I normally do not).  I take a lot of photos and videos at concerts and usually one battery lasts at least for the evening -- last concert was 300 pics and 4 vids.  I have only had this battery for 2 months, so I cannot comment on its longevity. This battery fits perfectly and looks exactly like the one that came with the camera!  I think it is an amazing value for the price!!!  Almost choked when I saw the Sony price of $69.00!!!", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "good buy and great price", "Author": "Rock Beaver", "ReviewID": "REMGLM2JJSW9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works well, esp. for the price (I paid about $8 a piece). I seems to discharge itself in NEX-7.

They hold perhaps 2/3 the charge of the Sony, but that is of little importance because they still allow hundreds of photos and are perfect as back-ups.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony Nex5N replacement batteries.", "Author": "AlexF", "ReviewID": "R1XJ4RQH727X93", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the 2 pack of batteries as back-ups for my Sony Nex-5N.
