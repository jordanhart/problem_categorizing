{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Buy For Just Starting out", "Author": "Bryan Swaffield", "ReviewID": "R18ROR0Z9BZWLS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera just came in the regular Canon Kit so that's a different review. The bundle is what I want to focus on. I instantly got rid of the SD card reader as I looked up reviews online and some said it just crashed there computer or deleted their photos; it's also 7 dollars if you buy it by itself. Go ahead and buy a better one if you need to. The T5i comes with a cord to attach the camera directly to a usb port so its not necessary.The battery charger is also kind of redundant because you get one with the kit, although the one in the bundle comes with a car charger, also not really necessary.The remote clicker and SDXC card are both good products. The card is class 10 which is not too good not too bad. Just right for general photography and videoing.The tripod is like 30$ and pretty unsturdy. Ive seen some reviews about cameras falling off of it and almost breaking or the connection point being pretty insecure. So far it seems like the camera is right tight in there and wont fall out, I jostled it around a little. Unless you accidently hit the quick release but even then its not like it just slides right out so easily. Good starting tripod but upgrade if you are going to be serious with landscape and other photography like that.The cleaning kit is pretty standard but has everything you need, and ive ended up using it more than i thought i would.The filters i havent opened but ive felt them and they seem pretty good quality. Heavy glass.The backpack is also pretty standard but its awesome. Three main compartments with some hidden extra little pockets here and there to fit everything you need.Another problem i have is that the kit didnt come with an eyecup like the canon website says it should. Going to call cameta and see if its their fault or canon discontinued this or something.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "kevin michael huffman", "ReviewID": "R2HRVCHU6P9NYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought for my wife for Christmas , she had a old canon rebel for several years, need less to say ....she was blown away,", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "this is realy good deal", "Author": "Rey C", "ReviewID": "R390ICTGOIDI04", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this bundle is already complete and you gonna love it fa sho .. and you can start photography at this bundle and really easy to use", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first DSLR", "Author": "Juan S.", "ReviewID": "R3JEVW4DWDLMN5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR, so, i have not idea how can i use, but let me time and i will get the best photos!", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,014.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens + <2> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card + <3> Spare LP-E8 Battery +\n<4> Battery Charger for LP-E8 + <5> Precision Design 67mm (UV/CPL/ND8) Filters + <6> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control +\n<7> PD DSLR Sling Backpack + <8> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <9> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader +\n<10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens with 64GB Card + Battery & Charger + Backpack + 3 UV/CPL/ND8 Filters + Remote + Tripod Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zhTTZVxhL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CAUQDNG"}}
