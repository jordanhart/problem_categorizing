This is a very easy camera to use and its small size makes it easy to have along.  I have always been happy with Canons and my PowerShot S2 IS has been a great camera.  It is just a bit bigger than I wanted for traveling.  The new A2100 takes equally great (or better photos) and there is not another small camera around that had those four requirements listed above.  Zoom is important to me and getting 6x in a small camera is hard to find.  The only very small drawback is that it takes awhile to be ready for the next photo when the flash is used - a small price to pay for all the other great features.", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Best in Its Class!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3GM85NNAAQOEH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I take pictures of meetings and wanted a pocket camera with good low light handling because some people in the meetings don't like to be disturbed by flash.  I have owned and still own many pocket size digital cameras.  But I end up having to carry my bulky SLR to the meetings because the pocket cameras don't handle low light well.  Another feature I want is the convenience of AA batteries instead of those special types.  A2100IS meets both of my needs.Other features, such as face detection, auto white balance, and button locations, are really great too.Why did I remove one star?  The low light pictures are still noisy, though acceptable (for the price).  The flash does not reach far enough, so when I got a chance to use flash for a group of 8 people today against light, the picture turned out to be less satisfactory than the one without flash.  You would normally expect dark faces without flash since it was against light, but the low light handling (along with face detection) turned out to work better than flash shooting.This is Canon's cheaper model, so they delay applying the more recent technology.  A larger CCD like the one they use for SD990 (1/1.7\"), plus a larger lens (f2.8 or better) would make this camera a dream. If SD990IS uses AA batteries, I would have already bought it.Still, this camera is the best in its class and price range.  If you don't care about AA batteries and rather have a smaller and lighter camera to carry, and don't mind a spending little more money, consider SD990IS.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nothing but good things to say about it.", "Author": "David H.", "ReviewID": "R1K6IUEDGTSUBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my last digital camera way back in 2003, so it has been a long time coming.  I've only had this new camera for 2 days, and so far I am really impressed with it, and only have good things to say about it.  I'm not really a camera expert and really don't use the Program mode, but rather just keep it in Auto for now.So here is the list of a few things I like about it so far.It takes 2-AA batteries, so no more expensive specialty batteries.The camera literally boots up in about 1 second, and you are ready to take pictures.The 3\" LCD display is crisp and clear.The 6x zoom really brings in those far away objects.In Auto mode it can automatically adjust to Macro if the object < 1' away.You don't have to turn on the camera to view your pictures, just press the Playback mode button.When in Movie mode you can zoom while in the middle of filming.There is so many more good things to say about it, but the kids want me to go play badminton with them now.I have no regrets buying this camera, and would recommend it to anyone.-David", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Richard Sherman Sandmans Co", "ReviewID": "R1Q690H58GHGR6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are a lot of cameras out there, so I went directly to consumer reports for help on my search. This camera had all the whistles and bells for the buck! I also purchased a Transcend SDHC 16GB card which holds about 5000 pictures, or almost 3HRS of video! I use the camera for my construction before, during and after photos. Blowing threw a couple hundred pictures a day the space was needed. The camera was very easy to learn; just read the manual first and understand the funtions first, and soon you'll be on your way to some incredible photos! I used to be a point and shoot guy, but not any more. With a little practice, this camera could be your next best friend. P.S.

However, in less than 2 yrs, the camera mode dial stopped working (only Auto worked) and now the LCD screen has gone almost completely white so you can't use it as a viewfinder.  I expected more from Canon.  When I inquired about getting it repaired thru canon, they wanted $110.  So I'm looking for a new camera.**********************************************************************************************************************I wasn't really in the market for a new camera.  I had a nice Lumix FZ-20 digital SLR that took good pictures, although it was falling behind current technology, being only a 5MP camera.  However, after spending a wedding taking pictures with the smaller Lumix TZ5, I was hooked.  I knew I'd be doing a lot more photography, and having a lot more fun, if I could carry a camera in my pocket, rather than having to strap on a camera bag.  I sold my SLR the next day and started reading the reviews for compact cameras in the $200-250 range.It seemed clear from the reviews that Canon had the edge in this market, however I still had some loyalty to my old Panasonic Lumix, and had liked the compact Lumix I had shot the wedding with.  The decision came down to either a Lumix TZ5, or the Canon A2100.  Both were high resolution cameras, and both had image stabilized zooms, although the Lumix had a longer zoom range than the Canon.  After reading literally 100's of user and pro reviews, I stumbled onto [....] and found examples of full resolution pictures taken with both cameras of roughly the same subjects.  The clarity and color rendition of the images taken with the Canon, especially when enlarged, were startlingly superior to the Lumix.  The Canon pictures captured detail, texture, and a superbly natural color rendition, whereas the Lumix appeared grainy, darker, and flat.  The A2100 was able to capture the clear edges of metal structures photographed against a bright background, while in the shots taken with the Lumix the details were completely washed out.Another great resource was the CNET review site.  CNET uses a standardized test for all their cameras to determine how clear the image is at increasing ISO values (for the non-technical, this directly relates to what your photos will look like when you shoot either in low light or when you need to use faster shutter speeds to capture things in motion).  Here again, the Canon was VASTLY superior to the Lumix.  Print on a book page and the smallest markings on a tape measure were easily legible even at an ISO of 800, and the white balance was perfect.  By contrast, in the exact same shots taken with the Lumix the white balance was off, turning the white page a dirty beige, the print on the page is virtually illegible even at ISO 100, and the hash marks on the ruler are almost invisible by iso 400.  I was convinced.I've had the Canon A2100 camera for a month now, and really like it.  The images are clear with very little noise or grain, color rendition is stunning, and the camera is exceptionally easy to operate.  Face detection works well, as does the i-contrast system for ensuring that faces are appropriately exposed.  On Auto mode, the camera almost always selects the correct mode for the shot, but you can always override it and choose the mode you want.  Having the Program mode available allows those of us who have been shooting for years more leeway in setting individual parameters for special shots.  The camera seems to have an exceptional ability to capture shots without using the flash (which I hate to use unless absolutely necessary).  Even shots taken outdoors at night on the special ISO 3200 setting are clear and show almost none of the grain or noise you'd expect at this high an ISO value.Some users have expressed concerns about the battery life with this camera.  Admittedly, when I used standard alkalines, I got a low battery alert after about 65 shots.  I then switched to Energizer \"Ultimate Lithium\" batteries, and have taken over 500 shots- and they're still going.  I consider this very good performance for both the battery and the camera.  I heartily recommend this camera for those who want an easy to take along, easy to operate camera that produces excellent quality photos.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great little point-and-shoot", "Author": "ExcitableBoy", "ReviewID": "RCWGU1AXSIZFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent point-and-shoot in the $200 price range. I bought it last week to get some extra features over my two-year-old Nikon Coolpix L11 without spending too much money. Two year's evolution in technology and about $60 extra bucks over the $150 L11 has given me a new camera that greatly improves on what I had in every way. One thing I want to mention is the \"digital tele-converter\" feature.This is unlike \"digital zoom\" which merely crops a portion of the recorded image and reduces the size of the image below 4000 x 3000 pixels. The tele-converter feature increases the effective maximum focal length of the optical zoom from the 35mm film equivlent of 224 mm to 432 mm without reducing the size of the image from 4000 x 3000 pixels. I have only tested this in good sunlight, but I see very little reduction in image quality like I would expect had I used traditional digital zoom.I can think of only one down-side to a camera like this that uses two AA batteries and that is for people who want to take flash shots in rapid succession. Those folks should look for cameras with a bigger battery pack which will take less time to recharge the flash unit. This is not a problem for me, and I like the convenience of the commonly available batteries.In short, I am very happy with this camera.ETA (8/30/09) This camera sold from Amazon in early July for around $210. Now, it is being offered here though 3rd party resellers at more than the Canon suggested price of $250. It's still a good camera, but I would refuse to pay more than retail for it, just on principle.ETA (10/20/09) Gee, this camera has been discontinued (Canon seems to be phasing out the A-series) and replaced by something better at the same price point, the Canon PowerShot SX120IS 10MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom. I don't own the new model, but it ups the zoom to 10X, and more importantly, adds aperture priority, shutter speed priority, and manual exposure modes. Even the reduction from 12MP to 10MP is a plus in my book, since I would expect this to give some improvement in dynamic range.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Camera I've Owned", "Author": "C.

I was torn between it, a Lumix, and a wide angle Cannon that had 12x zoom.  I am so glad I chose this one.  I just used it on a trip the MI UP and took pictures of the kids, scenery, Lake Superior under sun and fog, sunsets, the full moon, foliage, you name it.  LOVE the macro, colors are really gorgeous, landscapes (I took the same shot with the auto and landscape to compare, color obviously better on the landscape mode) and moon shots amazing.  I had some blurring on my action shots of the kids in motion when it was on auto (I didn't switch to kids/pets since its supposed to adjust on its own).  The zoom was great, needed a tripod for the full moon, but made due with propping it on a can that was handy.  A couple times I was annoyed to wait between snopshots for it to set again, but it was faster than any I've used previously.  My family has been nothing but compliments on the picture quality that resulted from the trip, and I agree there was definite improvement compared to my last camera, the Cannon A1000.  So, for a busy Mom that wants quality and ease, small size/portability, this was it.  Great versatility, and I'm looking forward to investigating its other features like b&w; and sepia exposures, etc.  Oh, after all of a 4 day weekend, my batteries were still good; I used it the following weekend at the Renaissance festival, still charged, and only regular cheap batteries.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I was looking for", "Author": "Justin Hanson", "ReviewID": "R81UY4HA6TWQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a Canon Rebel and love it, but because of it's size I hardly never had it with me when I was out and about.

Some of the reviews that I read were critical of not having a view finder. The only time I missed that was in bright light on the beach.

I bought a new sim card for this camera and formatted it immediately and have had no issues with it yet. Downloading images on to my computer could not have been easier. The quality of pictures printed is far superior to the Kodak EasyShare this camera replaced. The video quality is decent as well too. I like that you can zoom while taking video.

This camera fit the bill, and the price was within my range especially on Amazon. It is a little bit larger than what she wanted since most girls like little petite cameras to hold in their purse, but it fits in her clutch so that's all that matters. What really made her like it after she started using it was the quality of the pictures, especially the ones outside. It's almost annoying now how many pictures she is taking; I almost have to hide from her at times!Overall, I think this was a great buy for what I was looking for. She doesn't have to fiddle with the different camera modes, which are worth checking out when I'm playing with it because it's fun to me, but she doesn't really care about. Oh yeah, one more thing, I also bought it because it runs on AA batteries because she is always losing her cell phone charger and I figured that would carry over to a camera battery charger. The ease of using AA batteries and being able to just go buy new ones if she doesn't have any rechargeables was a big plus. The camera will run through a couple AA batteries in one night because she and her friends have to review every single picture that is taken to make sure they all look good in it, but its easy enough just to bring along two extra AA batteries, then charge them all overnight.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera and more", "Author": "J \"Jaxnapier\"", "ReviewID": "RE2QZQYO98L2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera right before my vacation.

I'm very glad I bought this camera.  It was reasonably priced and had standard AA Nickel metal hydrate batteries, instead of a special propriatery battery and memory card, like the Sony.  I was very interested in the image stabilization feature, as I can no longer hand-hold a camera steady enough to prevent blurring.  Although the manual settings are not complete, one can tweak some of the features to allow for full manual operation.  I took a great photo of the full moon, with a tripod, and I was able to tweak the settings into an exceptionally clear photo.Yes the camera is a little bulky, but having standard AA batteries is worth the inconvenience.  Getting the 8GB HCSD card, with a reader, was a great deal.  I like the feature of creating a folder for each month.  I never directly download pictures via the camera because of the slow speed.  I only download via the card reader and Windows Explorer, which is very fast.  I like the 3\" large screen.A great camera that I highly recommend, provided you take the time to experiment and tweak the settings.  Taking time exposure with a tripod and the shutter delay allows me to take great pictures, just like my old Canon AE-1.Obviously, I would prefer a digital SLR, but for the cost, this camera was well worth it.  I have learned that it is not worth it to invest heavily in an expensive camera since the technology curve is so steep that the camera becomes obsolete so quickly.  An extended warranty is worthless, because most electronics will fail within the first year.  After that, it is unlikely to have problems (except with a Sony) for quite a while.  When the camera finally dies, it would not be worth fixing, but rather buy a new camera with the latest technology features.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera at a Great Price", "Author": "John B.

Picture quality is crisp yet not too digitally sharpened or saturated.  Movie mode takes some decent movies too but it doesn't focus properly when you play around with the zoom amidst a video capture, so set your zoom before starting the video and try not to zoom in and out during a vid shoot.  Don't get me wrong, the video still comes out decent but the finer details (like scoreboards and Christmas lights) will not be as clear if you adjust the zoom during a video.  My only complaint is battery life.  Since it only uses 2 AAs they do drain quickly, sometimes with very little warning.  I got around this problem by purchasing an energizer universal power cable for a few bucks from amazon.  I couldn't be happier with another point and shoot camera.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Morrell Jacobs III", "ReviewID": "RUW3E9EC1HNGS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with the camera - pictures are excellent.

For example, I was shooting a scene in a French square at night.  It was fully lighted and I was videoing the dancing.  In the middle of the screen where the light in the distance was part of the composition, the pink vertical line came down through the middle of the video - both on the screen and in the actual footage. Also, if you shoot any video, the batteries are gone in a flash.  On my vacation I had to be very conscious of them and make sure that I had plenty of extras. Even if I did not shoot any video, I couldn't always make it through a day of moderate use. I have since changed to rechargeable Sanyo eneloops, which I hope will make a difference, but it would be much better if I didn't have to think about it so much.  Apart from that, the pictures are great - clear, excellent color, easy to shoot. Unlike its predecessor, it has more flexibility in terms of settings. The large screen is definitely a plus.", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost perfection", "Author": "Ken Zemach", "ReviewID": "R1RSOOC9QXZY92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:  AA batteries, image stabilization is fantastic, great zoom, great pics.Cons: I miss having the small optical viewfinder that was on prior versions.
