{"Reviews": [{"Title": "New Player In Point & Shoot Realm", "Author": "JDP", "ReviewID": "RT8N4VI5TYWO4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As with all new electronic toys, I had to take this particular model for a test drive before wrapping it up as a gift for a family member who is absolutely sold on nothing else but point and shoot cameras. Myself owning several Nikon & Canon film/DSLR systems over the years, I have to admit that I've never been a huge fan of point and shoot cameras. Surprisingly I did find that the Nikon P90 was definitely worthy of a second look. By far, this camera is a step up over the much maligned Nikon P80.Packed with a 24x optical zoom (26-624mm) lens, the 4 way Vibration Reduction system incorporates Optical Image Stabilization to an ISO capability of 6400. In Sport Continuous Scene Mode, the P90 is capable of 15fps high-speed shooting at up to 45 frames per burst. When shooting outdoors in various transitions I was pleasantly surprised that the P90 operated smoothly without the usual demons associated with the older P80 system. It delivered an array of great outdoor photographs in both auto, sports and manual modes that required absolutely no editing.Shooting indoors can be another story. Like all point and shoots the P90 does have its limitations in low light conditions. For me the long shutter lag in between shots is annoying. If users want to shoot in auto mode alone and don't have the time or patience to work the settings for indoor shots, this camera is probably not for you. However, the P90 can be tweaked to deliver indoor photographs.The bottom line is taking the time to know the camera and making the proper settings. A basic fix is the VR (Vibration Reduction) feature. This should be activated, especially indoors. For those that insist on shooting in auto mode and in low light situations, the noise gremlins are indeed going to be noticeable due to a higher preset ISO. This will undoubtedly lead to dark and low quality photographs. To alleviate that scenario I suggest that if auto is the preference, try shooting in a stationary, programmed auto mode.Another unique add on is the 3\" tilting LCD screen. The LCD screen has a protective anti-glare coating. The tilted screen is a nice tool especially for shooting in the prone position. I only question the durability of the extension arm over time. Add in the Best Shot Selector (BSS),Red-Eye, Smile and Blink Proof features and you have the whole package.In video mode, average quality is produced at 24 frames per second at 16:9 aspect ratio. HD would have been a sweet addition. As with all new digital cameras it comes down to memory card speed and top shelf batteries. Use of no name batteries can easily short out the system or leak. I recommend that buyers spend the extra bucks on SDHC cards and a durable tripod. The Nikon Coolpix P90 comes packed with (1) EN/EL5 Li-ion rechargeable battery, battery charger, USB cable, audio/video cable, strap, lens cap, one year warranty and software cd.Even with its limitations indoors, seasoned point and shoot owners will undoubtedly enjoy all the bells and whistles that are packed on to this camera. As with all point and shoots the bottom line is convenience. Overall, for the price tag the Nikon P90 brings a lot to the table.", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Like a Dream", "Author": "Malachi A.

The zoom issues described in previous reviews are easily solved by tweaking the iso, aperture or shutter speed. The camera also has several settings such as aperture or Shutter priority modes to assist with evenly regulating exposure making it easy to use for 1st timers. After reading the manual every picture i took came out in amazing quality. The tilt screen makes taking pictures at impossible angles easy. The 24 inch zoom lets you take close ups from impossible lengths. it also comes with Vibration reduction to stabilize said zoom shots Noise reduction to help when high iso is necessary.

L. Smith \"Back Country Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R1UKQSGOBGX2I1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon Coolpix P90 is what it is, a Point & Shoot Camera.  It is not a DSLR and was never designed to replace a DSLR.  Duh!I do a lot of back country travel both in 4X4 vehicles and on foot and the P90 is a dream come true.  It's light and packs easily on my belt, it's versatile and the super zoom lets me frame shots without climbing all over a mountain.  It has easy to use controls and I can shift in seconds from a macro shot of a cactus blossom to an action shot of a javalina running along the river bottom.  I would love to take the DSLR guy on some of my hikes and let him pack a camera, tripod and three or four lenses around for the day.  I wonder who will get all the shots and who will still be several miles back trying to shift lenses!Honestly, I've been the whole SLR/Darkroom route and I have eight film cameras and a dozen lenses sitting in a box in the closet.  I started using digital cameras back when you paid a lot of money for a 2 megapixal camera.  I bought a Coolpix 4500 and took almost 3000 pictures with it.  I banged it around, dropped it in the dirt and it never stopped taking really good pictures.Nikon knows how to make great cameras and the Coolpix P90 is a great camera.  Don't let the \"flamers\" fool you with their horrific reviews.  They buy a Point & Shoot camera and complain bitterly that it doesn't do the same thing a DSLR does.  Wow, I suppose the same person buys a Saturn and complains because it doesn't handle like a BMW M6.I've been playing with my new P90 and have over a hundred pictures in 5 days.  It's going to be a great camera and a fantastic travel companion.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Seattle Reader", "ReviewID": "R2KHQXIVI193T9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several Nikon Digital Cameras and was considering an  SLR when I read the reviews on this camera. It is everything and more than promised. I just returned from a trip to Italy and the pictures are the best I have ever taken.  The wide angle is not quite as wide as my old Nikon 5000 with a wide angle lense and adaptor, but more than sufficient.  In Paris I was able to photograph the entire facade of Sacre Cour standing in front of it.  The sports feature is incredible. I used it to take pictures of my grand daughters little league game. I got every step of her bat swing and each picture was clear and in focus. It took 15 pictures in less than a minute.

I have always been a Canon person. My first choice the Canon SX1, but it was going to be expensive, and no one seemed to know the actual release date, so I decided against it.  Then, there was the Canon SX10, but it didn't seem like much of a jump from the S5. I not only wanted lots of zoom, I also wanted to be able to take continuous shots rapidly. The S5 IS is really slow in this respect. This was to be my Mother's Day present, and I wanted to make sure I got just what I wanted!After doing a LOT of research, I began to think the Nikon P90 might be a good choice for me.  I had looked at the many pics taken with it on Steve's Digicam web site, but I always struggle to know if they have been photoshopped, or manipulated in some way. I went to a local camera shop, to try out the Canon SX10 against the Nikon P90, and they made my job easy, because they didn't have the Canon model in stock.  Oh yes, and I also tried the Panasonic Lumix, but it was just too light for me, and the zoom on it is only 18X.  I tried the Nikon P90 around the store, and it seemed like a good fit.My first shots had a lot of blur to them.  It really frustrated me, and I was concerned I had made the right decision. It seemed that no matter what I took a picture of, it was blurry.  Also, we have a clear view of Pike's Peak, and I love to get those early morning shots of the mountain, and they just didn't seem to \"pop\".  Our 16 year old son, who really knows his way around a camera, gave me some tips, and now, I really think this is an awesome camera!  My early morning shots of Pike's Peak still aren't the best, but just about anything else I take a picture of, comes out awesome!  The colors are true, and it is a LOT of fun to use!  I just got a tri-pod today, and not having really used one before, I am learning how much it helps steady shots!There are maybe two downsides to this camera, and to me, they are small ones.  First, is the back LCD screen. It doesn't swing out like the Canon cameras do. One real plus to the swing out idea, is that when they swing back in, they can be flipped over, against the camera, so as to protect the LCD screen. I am just used to that is all.  I need to get a protective screen cover for it, and I think it will be fine.  The other 'downside', is that if I really use the camera most of the day, I pretty much use up my battery.  This camera uses the Li-ion batteries, so for me, it was imperative I get an extra.  I found a seller on Ebay that sold two of them at a really good price, and they came fully charged, and in small plastic cases too! Now I have 3 camera batteries!So, if you are looking for a really fun, point and shoot camera, with lots of zoom, I highly recommend this camera.  I almost didn't buy it, because I saw some reviews of it that weren't stellar.  For once, I am glad I didn't listen to the crowd!", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing photos in daylight, fast zoom and fits in some pockets", "Author": "A. Vancleave", "ReviewID": "R1KHZELOWNM2OS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the P90 since my wife has a compact P&S; and I wanted to fangle with manual settings.Picture quality:  Simply beautiful.  Overall the camera takes amazing photos in daylight and cloudy lighting, they are spectacular in auto mode and even better with slight tweaking.The zoom and lens: I've taken stunning shots in full 24x zoom of skiers in action shots with chunks of snow flying sharp and detailed.  The optic stabilization is perfectly adequate to hand hold the camera taking shots in full zoom - and I disagree with the reviewer \"E.C. Bummer\" and am highly suspicious of that review.  So I gave this a 5 instead of a 4 to balance.  I've also taken some very nice macro shots of tulips and the focus has been very cooperative and speedy.Learning curve and manual settings:  Getting familiar with adjusting the manual settings for aperture, shutter speed and contrast and white balance does not take long.  In about a week and 100 photos I was fully familiar with dialing in the settings and modes.  It takes some patience if you want to experiment out of auto mode and be comfortable changing the setup; and you will take some awfully exposed shots in the process - but that is the point of this camera.  I do like the overall layout and the menu for changing manual settings - fast and logical with 2 programmable profiles for preset settings.Lowlight and indoors for any digital camera is a challenge - just a nature of the beast.  I've had good results but you will get the usual noise if there is not enough light.  You will get very good results indoors relative to the technology, price and less expensive P&S;'s and even more expensive cameras made just a year ago.Video: Honestly would have expected more from this.  I took a 5 minute vid snowboarding down a mountain.  Perhaps this was an extreme test but the video was unwatchable pretty much.  I have seen much better results with compact cameras with video recording.  No HD.  Likely in good lighting with minimal shake the video recording probably does nicely for online video uploading.LCD and viewfinder:  I do agree the LCD does not seem to give a fair representation of the images and there is a delay once an image is displayed in play mode before the processing adjusts the image to high resolution.  My high-end gaming machine did the same thing - so not sure if it is because of the 12MP images or something else.  I prefer the viewfinder in daylight anyway for taking images.Size: I was able to fit the camera in the hand pocket of a Columbia jacket.  It is large for a P&S; and I could certainly feel the weight in my unzipped jacket while snowboarding with it.  In your hands it is light and comfortable however.  I do like holding it.What would make this camera better:1. Ability to go from 'off' to 'play mode' to review pictures.  Instead the camera has to wake up the lens and the lens cap must be removed.2. The camera can be turned on when the lens cap is on.  The lens will try to force itself out against the lens cap, eventually giving up and the camera provides an error.  Just does not seem this is good for the optic mechanics.3. I wish there was a lock for the stabilization of the optics.  When traveling I can feel the parts moving in my hand.  Seems like the ability to lock everything would preserve the life of the optics.4. No screw for filters.  Would have been nice have thrown a polarizer on for bluer skies.  The camera does have many digital settings to try to get to filter type results.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Manual Is My Friend", "Author": "Morgan C. Valley", "ReviewID": "R1FOTYJSMMPXKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon's P90 Hybrid Point And ShootMy turn to weigh in on this camera!  First, I was pretty surprised at the mixed reviews, most of which I read after ordering my P90. Even the negative posts didn't scare me though, as I have owned a Coolpix 5700, another \"hybrid PNS\", for about six years and have had nothing but great luck with it. (Many thousands of photos later, I still love it.) And, hats off to Nikon ... five years into my 5700, it came up lame and Nikon USA fixed it and had it back to me in a week at no charge.To be fair, I AM a user's guide reader, which is one thing everyone should be doing with a tool that offers so many features. Once you've been through a few manuals, it gets easier to understand. Trust me; your manual is your friend.The accusation that the P90 takes terrible pictures is absolutely absurd. Incompetent photographers take terrible pictures. The camera is perfectly capable of taking excellent quality pictures that will be satisfying to all but true professionals. There are reasons that those National Geographic shots are so impressive ... starting with the fact that few of those photographers are using a three hundred dollar point and shoot for the brunt of their work, and ending with the fact that those people behind the lens are far more trained in photography than the average person, or me for that matter. (And remember, we see the best of their work.)Getting on with the P90, I am perfectly smitten. The monster LCD screen is just terrific, but it still has a conventional viewfinder with a diopter adjustment. You can switch between the two in an instant with one button. It's a wonderful camera that has so much control at the fingertips, and can be adjusted so quickly, there really isn't any reason, aside from user error, that great results can't be achieved.  White balance, exposure compensation, metering, ISO and shooting mode setting are all of general note here, and they are all quick and easy to get to via the menus or the mode dial. And then, a reality check is in order.White balance used to be corrected with filters on conventional cameras, but now it is done digitally. When you scroll to the white balance menu on the P90 and make a change, feedback is visually immediate on the screen if applicable. For instance, setting it to incandescent will get rid of the orange hue of indoor lights. You should adjust for white balance depending on your shooting situation and think of it each time you shoot.Exposure compensation is available on the multi-selector with just one push of the button. As you then adjust the exposure by click, again, you see the change on the screen. Although you can also use an auto bracketing feature, I really like this feature when I see the first shot on screen and want to decrease or increase exposure fast and easy.Four types of metering are available. I happen to like the spot meter for most shooting. One trick (useful with all digital cameras that offer spot metering) is to meter various things in the shot. You will see the exposure change before your eyes. Metering something dark will lighten the shot or, the reverse, metering something light will darken the shot. For instance, I have two black dogs with white paws and briskets. If I meter their faces directly the shots are always overexposed. I often meter the white brisket by pushing the shutter release button half down and then recompose the shot to take the picture. You can do this in all kinds of shooting situations, provided your subject remains in focus.As in film photography, the most useful ISO speeds are probably 64 through 400. Expect shots at 800 and 1600 to be digitally noisy, just as they would be grainy in film. Again, the P90 allows for almost instant changing of ISO settings, something you couldn't do with film.As for shooting modes, all the standard modes (aperture and shutter priority as well as program auto) are available on the mode dial, including full manual, and lots of other bells and whistles. A good many people will treat the P90 like a pocket camera and just go full auto, which is fine. That will yield many good results. However, for those who are more inclined to an artistic eye or more control, the camera is feature rich enough to offer almost limitless possibilities. And, that is the reason to digest the manual fully.  Remember, it's digital, so you can delete failed shots (and just imagine the waste and money if it was film and prints).Listen, there are a hundred other added values on the various menus. Voice recording, time lapse movies, continuous shooting at 15 frames per second ... blah, blah, blah. I won't even go there. Suffice it to say that it's a lot of value for fewer than three hundred bucks.Now, let's address the reality check. Much of the hype about the 24X zoom is just that, hype. Few shots can be terrific at full length on a zoom of this quality, so don't count on using it for bald eagles a quarter mile away, let alone off tripod.  As stated above, don't hope for magazine quality shots at ISO 1600, it just can't happen. The built-in flash is standard fare.  Straight-on flash can be flat and unflattering in portraiture on any camera. It's also easy to wash out a shot ... so expect to bracket if the shot is important to you.Some have stated that the camera feels cheap because it is so light weight. I actually love that it is light and easy on the neck. Personally, I don't think it looks or feels \"cheap\" at all.Finally, I do have a few minor complaints. I cannot for the life of me understand why Nikon won't thread these cameras for filters. Sure, most filtering is digital these days, but I would kill sometimes for a polarizing filter and would very much have liked to keep a UV filter on the camera for lens protection, just as I always did on my old conventional cameras.  Further, I hate rechargeable batteries. I so wish that they would have gone with AA or AAA batteries which you can always find anywhere.Having stated that, I am giving the P90 five stars, because it's been an amazing, wonderful camera for me, and it's taking some killer good pictures, especially since I took the time to understand its potential.

I loved that little P4, but not its big restrictions. Like many other reviewers of the P90, I too am a \"Nikon Guy\". I have owned Nikon's film based 4004 and 8008's, and used the N90 over the years with great success. I researched the P80 and saw many unhappy and disatisfied reviews, so I held off on buying that, then I saw the P90. It is just a point and shoot, but it's a point and shoot on performance enhancing drugs. This thing can do it all, but not if you want to pull it out of the box and set it on AUTO. I understand this camera and I have read the manual, but even when I use the AUTO mode (green camera icon on the top dial), my pictures look horrible.This camera needs you to understand aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc... if you want crisp, clear, professional looking shots. I honestly have to say that even using some of the SCENE modes, will not necessarily produce the pictures that you might be expecting. That is why I gave it four stars and not five. That being said, when I select A on the top dial for Aperture priority, then I go into the menu and deselect Auto ISO, adjusting it for the light and subject matter, then turning the thumb dial to an appropriate F Stop, BAM! I get a magazine quality shot.It's a couple of steps, it takes a little know how and even a bit of effort, but you don't have to be a professional photographer to make it happen. Even when using a scene mode, you can still adjust the exposure manually by hitting the +/- side of the menu wheel on the back of the camera. A little up or a little down will make even a simple shot brighter or give it a dramatic feel if you darken your shot a notch or two.Another easy way make a good shot a great one is to use the view finder as opposed to the LCD screen. Granted, the big swiveling screen is a great option under the right circumstances, but Nikon gives you a choice for a good reason. Most point and shoots have dumped Viewfinders to save space, but even Consumer Reports will tell you that most people want and like them. A view finder will help you see what you are really looking at without the less-than-accurate influence the LCD will give. It's not unlike the way that when you are printing a picture from your computer, rarely does the printed image look exactly like the one on your monitor.If you are looking for National Geographic type pictures right out of the box, then the P90 is not for you. There are plenty of fairly priced point and shoots that will give just that. But if you want more than the typical Auto everything, (but with the option of Auto everything), and you will educate yourself even briefly on crafting a photograph by both reading the manual and understanding F-Stop (Aperture) vs. Shutter speed and using the White Balance and ISO, based on your conditions and situation, you will indeed see the P90 for what it is: an Advanced Mega-Zoom Point and Shoot Digital Camera that needs a little coaxing, and a small amount of patience and learning by the user.I have run 1300+ shots through mine and I'm constantly surprised at what the P90 can do when I try something new with the settings and gamble with some creativity. If you have a P90 and didn't like it at first, embrace your investment and give it another try. If you are thinking of buying a P90, commit to your purchase and know the camera before demanding perfection. I really like my P90. I am keeping it. I know it will never be a Digital Single Lens Reflex camera, but for just under $400, it's the closest you will get.

I have had two Nikon Coolpix during the last 4 years and loved them, so I was excited to upgrade to the P90. I had read all the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites, and assumed that the people who were writing bad reviews of the camera just didn't know how to use it.  I was wrong.First, I know it's a point and shoot camera and not a DSLR. But the quality of the photos the P90 took was terrible compared to my old Nikon Coolpix P5000. Unless I was outside with lots of natural light the photos from the P90 were all slightly blurred. Inside, I experimented with flash, no flash, Auto mode, P mode with ISO down to 64, reduced flash, heightened flash, adjusting the manual settings for the aperture, shutter speed, white balance and contrast. Could not get a good photo! And I've been using Nikons with the same features for years with no problem. Also, colors were too orange indoors, even with the flash.  Another reviewer said the photos looked like they were taken with a cell phone.  I thought this was exaggeration, until I saw some of my shots! Then I would take my old P5000 and shoot the same shot and it would come out perfect! I took over 400 photos with the P90 in two days, trying to see if the photos improved under any circumstances.  They didn't. I'm returning it to Amazon tomorrow.

And at smaller picture sizes, the optical zoom becomes MUCH greater, maybe 1000mm or more. And on the other end of the scale (26mm), the P90 gives a wider field of view than my prior Nikon, the P5100.But the P90 is not a one-trick pony. In fact, it can do a number of great tricks. Like the P5100, it has panorama assist (my favorite feature, though combining vertical and horizontal panning for large pictures would make it even better) with automatic stitching software, easy selection of different types of scenes (e.g.: fireworks, portrait, etc.), a wide range of camera/picture controls.I uploaded a picture of a flag taken inside, hand-held, at 1/15th second exposure with VR, with side-by-side comparison of the P90 and the P5100 and the P90 actually seems to be the better picture with less noise in the blue background. I'm sure you can find a camera which takes better low-light indoor pictures, but can you find one (in this price range) that does that PLUS takes 24x zoom pictures?I also find taking macro pictures (such as of flowers) to be much easier with the P90, especially with the tilting LCD. I had no trouble getting the P90 to focus correctly in macro mode - something the P5100 had problems doing. The P90's new manual focus is also a welcome addition, as is the much larger LCD monitor.This is the first Coolpix I've had (of 4) which has an electronic viewfinder, which gives you through-the-lens viewing plus lets you see all the camera settings, etc.Another reviewer complained about having to pop up the flash to use it. I'm just the opposite. To keep the P5100 from flashing when I don't want it to, I have to do a bunch of button-pressing to stop it, versus pushing one button to pop up the flash when wanted. To each his own.There's not room to list all the features I love, such as being able to crop, rotate, and/or retouch pictures in camera while reviewing them, as well as the real-time red-eye correction, blink warning, etc.On the cautionary side:(1) This is NOT a pocket camera. When the camera arrived in the mail, I was really surprised to see how big it is. I uploaded a picture with the P90 and P5100 side-by side from an angled overhead view so that you can see the difference. The P90 is about 20% wider and maybe 4x deeper (with lenses in all the way).(2) Even with VR, you cannot expect to take a picture handheld with a 624+mm zoom and get it perfectly sharp. Expect to use a tripod for such pictures, making this even less of a casual camera. If you order the P90 and don't have a tripod, you may as well order one at the same time.(3) No hot shoe. Again, I'm not getting a 24x zoom camera to do wedding photography, so it's not a big deal for me.Bottom line: I do not consider this a general-purpose camera. You either want/need the 24x zoom lens or you don't. If you do, there is nothing about the P90 which will make you sorry you got it, especially if you already have a camera which does other things you want, such as doing portraits, putting it in your pocket (though phones are taking over that role), etc.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Digi Cam....

Well at least till I see what they do next year.One gripe would be the video. It's almost like they have a deal with the video camera guys that says it will be the worst possible thing to do with this camera would be to use it for a video clip.  I don't think it could get much worst and still have the option on the dial.  Fix the video Mr. Nikon.If you do the point and shoot thing get this one.

This camera is not the smallest and does not easily fit in a small bag, definitely not a pocket. But I had to sacrifice size for features and optical zoom.Lets start with the pros:1. Great control, from shooting for dummies to full manual. The PASM dial mode is great. The closest thing to an SLR you can get in a non SLS2. Optical zoom is wonderful, the range is awesome 24X is quite amazing in a small package like this. But there are drawback, read in the cons section3. 3\" screen is great and has the smart variable angle to allow shooting from down low or up high. Thats all you really need, all these screens that swivel and rotate are just more fragile stuff asking to be broken. Nikon really did what a photographer needs.4. Image quality is OK, I have seen better on a 10MP camera. The color accuracy is good and noise level is great up to ISO 800. They have ISO 1600 3200 and even 6400 but forget it its way too noisy and useless. I setup my Auto Iso limit to 800.5. Manual focus capability is great to have but it comes with a baggage, read cons section.6. The usual Scene modes are available but not so easy to navigate and select. There are 2 programmable user modes that can be set for the most used scenes. Its a nice helpful feature.7. Quality of the camera feels good and solid but there are issues. Read on.Now for the Cons:1. Macro mode is just OK, it does the job but I have seen better. If you zoom out the feature is too small and if you zoom in you need to be feet away.2. Manual focus is slow to operate and once you invoke manual focus there is no simple one click to go back to AF. You actually have to change camera modes. Very annoying as I use MF a lot and wan to be able to switch back and forth easy.3. Strong lens vignetting at full zoom if the light is not perfect. Dont be tempted to crank up the ISO cause the noise will be even worst with the strong vignetting.4. Battery life is not great when using the screen, if using the EVF the battery last long.5. EVF is very useful but could use a higher resolution.Overall after taking about 3000 pics in all modes and conditions I can summarize that this is a great overall camera, its not the smallest one but if you need the huge zoom range, the manual controls and the view finder that is about as good as it gets. I strongly recommend having a second battery and have a decent tripod cause this camera is not the smallest and for a good night shot you must have a tripod.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Somewhat Disappointed", "Author": "John C.

I wish I had waited longer to purchase this camera and had the insight of the earlier reviews.To the other reviewers' points, I waited months before sharing my opinion so that I tested it vigorously. I READ the instruction manual several times to improve my user experience which did help to a certain extent.In many ways it is a sound performer, but please know the limitations. The Nikon Coolpix P90 is excellent for outdoor photography, especially on sunny days. In fact, no better pictures have I taken on any other camera SLR, digital or film. That laid out, I have not been able to push the full zoom to its maximum capacity without blurry results. Disappointing.Indoor photography is a mixed bag, ISO levels in the 400-800 are pretty usable when used in close proximity to the subject, and a flash or adequate lighting is used. This camera is not so good with any extreme zooms or action shots. I guess that is to be expected with this class of camera. I was hoping for a little better performance here though.The macro function is not what I hoped for. It takes several manual adjustments to get a decent shot. The same goes for any experimentation with depth of field shots. Granted this is a \"point and shoot\" classified camera in the $400 range, but I have had better luck with more basic point and shoots from Canon.Also, I find the video mode not too impressive either. Once you have set the focal length, it does not vary to allow proper zoom ins or outs.I really wanted to like this camera more than I do!So that is one person's opinion on this camera. I recently purchased a Canon PowerShot SX10IS to replace this unit.

The LCD and Viewfinder work well even in sunlight.  Shooting is very responsive for this price range bit a slight shutter lag reminds you that you didn't pay $1000 or more.  Controls allow you to go from point and shoot mode to full photographic freedom.The P90 provides the owner with a very portable yet powerful camera.  A similarly capable SLR camera would be very heavy, much larger and cost a great deal more.  Compare the P90 price, size and weight with a 26-624mm 35mm lens for your SLR and you will see why I love this camera.  Chances are you will need two or more lens to cover that range and each one that is \"Nikkor Quality\" will cost more than the P90.Finally, a few words for those that want something negative (or proof that I do not work for Nikon;-).  The LCD has a limited tilt range that hinders my ability to shoot at full arms length at any angle.  In low light focus time is about 1 to 2 seconds.

I researched for 3 months to make sure which camera I wanted. I came to the conclusion that the Nikon P90 had every single feature I wanted and within the price range I had. I read some bad reviews but I figured it couldnt be that bad and I would give it a shot. I recieved this camera for my birthday last week. I have never been so excited.This would best camera ever if not for one thing.... It is absolutely horrible at taking a picture. I read the manual twice and figured every feature out. I am not an idiot and not a pro photographer, but I have educated myself over the past few months studying eveything I can on photography and using manual settings on a camera.Over 2 days experiemented with just about every setting and different types of lighting. Most were on a tripod. After taking 500 pictures I could only got 1 of what I consider decent to high quality ( and I am not pickey either). Every picture was grainy, blury, or really bad quaility. I was shocked. The camera did everything bad that people have written about on here plus some. I couldnt believe how it could be this bad. This camera seemed to do what it wanted no matter what you set it on. every setting seemed to do the opposite of what it should do (ISO, shutter speed, Etc..). The worst part is that the auto focus constantly is thinking and never actually focuses. 3 days in a row the camera after 50 or so pics, the focus just stops and kept giving me the red blink. changing modes and powering off would not make it work. I had to let it rest a few hours then try again. The LCD Screen is so grainy and you can not tell what your pictures will look like until you load them in the computer. I really wanted to make this camera work because I loved it so much. A family member couldn't believe it either and went outside (sunny) to do some test shooting with it. He came back and said, \"Take it back\".Even if I was somehow able to make it work to photograh my art under perfect conditions, I was to afraid of how unreliable it would be to take any snap shot on trips to the museum or the zoo. Seriously my Iphone and my old 4MP HP Photosmart takes better snap shots.I was so upset to take it back to the store, but I did. After returning it I went over to the demo model in the store. Now that I was well versed in using this camera I picked it up and tested it. The one in the store did the same things, so I am sure I did not just get a bad one. I tried it against several models and the difference was amazing. Every camera, even the cheap mini cams took a better snap shot right in the store and focused fast and easy. You can see the difference in the screens too. I am glad I am rid of that hunk of junk. I can't believe Nikon hasn't pulled it off the shelf it is so bad.If you buy this camera, Please beware that at best it will be very difficult to get the shot! Save your receipt.

I am really happy with the upgrade.  The p90 takes excellent, sharp photos both indoors and out.  I have had no trouble with blurry images of poor quality as other reviews have stated.  I press the shutter button once to focus on the area I plan to shoot and then again when I am ready to snap the picuture.  I am no professional and my pictures with the P90 have turned out with just as good quality as DSLR cameras can take.

This is an excellent camera for the novice photographer who doesn't understand all of the tech specs of shooting with a DSLR camera.  The camera is light and easy to travel with vs. taking the DSLR on a family vacation with all its lenses and extra weight.  The rechargeable battery lasts a long time even with heavy shooting and I have a spare so that I can re-charge one and have it ready when the one in the camera runs down.  This is one advantage that Nikon has over other super zoom cameras.  I don't like having to use the rechargeable AA or AAA batteries because they just don't last as long as the Nikon rechargeable battery does.  The Nikon batteries also take up less space in your camera bag.  I am very satisfied with this camera!

Yet we really did not want to carry around a DSLR with an extra lens and then spend hours learning how to use all the features -- and use it correctly. We talked to a lot of folks and ended up with the Nikon P90 - and we are thrilled. It offers a lot of control if you want it, yet works very well as an intelligent point and shoot.We ended up taking over 1,300 pictures and except for a dozen or so shots(and mainly our fault), they are fantastic. Everything from very bright daylight/beach scenes, to sunsets, indoors at museums, cloudy days, a few Aussie Rules Football action shots, to a few pictures of the night sky all were handled by the camera. We will have a lot of work narrowing down the pictures for a book.A few highlights: The two modes for saving user-settings is easy to setup and a real time saver. I used the auto-bracketing a lot and it worked beautifully. The sports mode does work well, although the pictures are only 3 megs. We actually found the camera to be fast enough in most cases to capture the action in Fine mode also. The 24X telephoto lens is incredible. It's wide angled enough for indoor shoots yet the 24X telephoto is more then enough for anything we wanted to capture. The 12 megapixels captures very fine graduations of color. Some of our sunset pictures of Ayers Rock are just as beautiful as anything we saw selling in the stores from professionals. The body is well-shaped for your hand and feels solid.If you don't want to lug around a DSLR and extra lenses, nor spend the money for one, (which will easily run you twice the price of this camera), and want something that is easy to learn yet gives you a lot of creative flexibility, I suggest you take a good long look at this camera.THIS IS AN UPDATE (Feb 1 2010): Now that I have had the camera for about 6 months, I am even happier with it then before. I have found that the video, while not HD, to be very sharp and the sound clear. I have found that in some cases I don't bother with my HD video camera.

Klasmeier", "ReviewID": "R32G1Q36N90D9O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have spent about 1 month now with my Coolpix P90. I have taken about 2,000 photos in every condition I can muster to try it out and to give you the most information possible with my expirence. Unfortunately, I have made a bad purchase. Let me give you some background, I am moving from a 10 year old film camera over to digital and I am trying to keep the same quality of film, while using a digital camera. I am an automatic guy. I just want to take a photo and have it turn out right w/o me having to focus or perform any settings. I am not pleased with this product and here is why:1. The camera does not understand how to automatically focus on a subject.For example, I have my daughter standing 10 feet back in front of me with her positioned in the middle picture and the camera chooses to focus on the countertop behind her. If you have multiple subjects standing in front of you, the camera doesn't understand that you want all of them in focus....so it will pick one or two and focus on them, and then leave the rest out of focus, even if they are within a few feet of one and other. This is my biggest gripe and the reason why 1/2 of the photos I take have been unusable. The auto focus on this is horrid; the facial recognition is essentially nonexistent. I am not an engineer, but this seems to be the most basic fundamental requirement of any camera for the past 30 years and Nikon sure missed the mark on this.2. Horrible red eye - even with redeye reduction turned on, about 15% of all of my photos have red eye.A bizarre thing I have noticed a lot is that on my subjects one of their eyes will be red the other eye will be black. I don't understand why this is the case or how this could even happen, but it does. Another thing I have noticed is when you have multiple subjects, one or two will have red eyes and the others will not, making the entire picture useless. I have never seen red eye before in my 10 year old film camera and find it ridiculous that this newer technology on the P90 has red eye, and consistent red eye for that fact. This just doesn't make any sense to me. I know, I can buy software, blah blah blah, but who wants to hassle? I just want to take a picture and have the camera do what it is supposed to do.3. When having my digital photos developed, they lack the brilliance and crisp results I would expect.The images are so soft. For example, the hair on my daughter's head appears to be blended together as if I am watching standard definition television. While at the same time, getting my film photos developed at the same place yield cleaner more defined results. The hair on my daughter's head using my film camera is as I would see them in real life (or I guess you can relate them to high definition). I have taken many taken pictures side by side and they don't compare. About the old time I can get them to compare is when I am in brilliant daylight or considerable indoor light. I am using the maximum quality setting, BTW.4. The flash does not pop up automatically, before you take pictures, you have to click a separate button to pop up the flash. If you don't do that, your photo will not be useable.I hope this helps you understand what you are getting before you drop your hard earned money to get it. I cannot recommend to you what you should get as I only have this one to compare.

I take a lot of shots along the Lake Superior shoreline, and I have breathtaking pics of waves crashing on the rocks--you can see individual droplets sparkling in the air.  So for scenery and nature shots, this camera's great.  I also do a lot of \"artsy\" close up work (flowers, leaves, etc), and the results are really beautiful.

I haven't gotten one good dusk or night outdoor shot, no matter the setting, and indoors when it's all artificial light, the results are bad.  Either a strange red/yellow glow or poorly focused.

The continuous shot mode is great; shooting at around 12 frames per second...this makes getting that perfect shot during a sporting event or dance recital very easy.The camera has a great weight to it and is very comfortable to hold. I love that it has a flash release button so if you don't intend on using the flash you just don't open it.  The menu is easy to use.  Battery life seems to be around 4 hours and only takes about 2 to fully charge.  The camera comes with a lens cap and a neck strap, usb cable, tv cable, battery charger and battery.  I purchased a spare battery and recommend you search for a true Nikon EL-EN5 battery...I got mine for under $20.  The mfg recommends only using their brand, I concur.  From past experience I have seen off brand batteries mess the ports up so the camera becomes unusable.All in all if you are looking for a point and shoot with a lot of the manual capabilities of a SLR camera this is a good choice.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Highly recommended camera", "Author": "Robert D.

The pictures are extremely sharp even when cropped and enlarged.  Most of the time, it is best to put automatic and let the camera to it thing.  However, it also work wonderfully on both aperature and speed priority for those times when special treatment is desired.The only two drawbacks is that one cannot readily attach filters to the lens (for instance a UV filter to protect the lens) and the picture on the viewfinder and screen is not nearly as clear and sharp as what the picture actually.If one wants something a bit better than the simple point and shoot cameras and particularly with a great telephoto lens, this is the one to buy.

It is definitely worth spending the time to go through the manual for the finer performance details, however, it is not essential if you simply want to put the camera in auto mode and zoom into all of those shots that you wanted to take with your point & shoot but were just too far away.  No problem with the P90!  The clarity/color of the super-zoom shots you take are simply breathtaking.  Unless you are the type willing to pay, and knowledgeable enough to figure out, the $1500 + digital SLR, you will not notice the subtle improvements the digital SLR will provide.  The zoom, sports \"burst\" mode & panorama assist are the features I love the best.  This is an incredibly versatile camera.  The only drawback, if you can call it a drawback, is its size.

In other words, what would be a major criticism is really no problem because the resolution is fantastic, even hand-held at the far, far, edge of the 24 optical zoom (which doesn't have the abberation because it has only ocurred when I engaged the digital zoom).

I love them dearly and will always use them as my cameras of choice.I had purchased a Coolpix 8800 a few years ago and gave it mediocre reviews.  It is much larger, again, with the vertical grip, but it is rugged and works well, although it has a relatively small file-size, dimmer eye-level viewer and smaller screen.  It allows me lots of versatility, but I wanted something smaller, with larger file-sizes.The P90 offers that, far better movie choices and many more options for shooting right out of my purse.  This is a camera that can give me professional quality and versatility in non-flash situations that are unmatched by other grab cameras without the bulk of my professional systems.The lack of range of f-stops loses versatility in important areas.  It has no hot shoe, so it can only be gerry-rigged for complex flash situations.  I really don't plan to use it on that level.  It uses 4-1 compressed JPEG images, which take the quality down a bit and has no option for RAW images or uncompressed TIFFs.  The zoom seems jumpy, but that may just be a situation where I need practice.At extreme optical and digital zoom, combined with the best VR system I have used, it produce some very nice results hand-held.  I can hardly wait for my next encounter with the red tail hawk in the marsh next to my home!  It's also nice to have an actual wide-angle option.One of the main reasons I purchased this unit is that I love Arches and Canyonlands NPs and last year when I was there, in the high desert, the winds howeled!  The downside of that was dust on the sensors in my D-SLRs, even the self-cleaning D90 and DX300.  There is no worse feeling than getting back to a motel, uploading hundreds of photos, and finding that you have to retouch virtually every one.  Welcome back to film!  With a sealed system,I can wander all over and not worry about dust!So far, I've only had the camera a few days, I haven't taken any spectacular shots to share.  I still haven't taken anything I would want at 20X30, so I'll reserve judgement on compressed JPEGs.  They may be better than I expect.  I found that I love the \"food\" scene mode!  It has a color temperature adjustment right on-screen.  Since this will be an available light camera (I despise on-camera flash), this will be a useful mode.I will probably update this report after I've done some meaningful shooting.  A 4gig SD card holds almost 650 shots, so quality is going to be a big issue.  The battery has a limited life, so I will be purchasing extras.  I just have to remember it's a backup!  If it's a good one for me, it will be the best camera the average amateur will ever own, and that is not ego talking.  I am just uber-picky...1-2-10  I've had the camera long enough now to find some features I really like and also some that are very irritating.  I have to remember it is just a backup!I found that there are some great quick adjustments in scene modes, such as a color temperature adjustment for the food mode.  I love the 15fps feature in sports mode, be be aware that the file-sizes are greatly reduced.  The movie modes are fine, despite having limited zoom options.  You can still zoom long ahead of shooting or stay wide-angle, depending on the situation.  Not HD-quality, but I am not a videographer and for my purposes, if I see a UFO, I will be ready to shoot!  I CCD-based vibration control is great and the digital zoom is actually pretty decent.On the down-side, I feel that the zoom is hard to control precisely, and can really be a disadvantage.  Because I like a lot of control, I hate the on-camera flash with no option to use external flash via a hot-shoe.  I can still slave other flashes if needs be.  As I feared, not having a RAW option is a disadvantage.  Compressed JPEGs show degredation of images and 12.1 MP ends up being about the same quality as my old 8.1 MP Coolpix 8800 set for TIFF. I have not been impressed with the color correction and graininess of the images in low available light.  Going into this purchase, I knew I wouldn't care for the LCD eyepiece.  It's better than the one on the Coolpix 8800, but doesn't come close to the optical finders in the DSLRsI just have to remind myself that I bought the unit to carry in my purse or daypack as a grab camera and it is not for general use!  Once I take some better photos, I'll put them up.  Right now, we are in the grey part of the year and there isn't much I want to shoot.  In another month, the snow will be great, and my dog and I will be traveling the winter trails.  Hopefully, I'll be traveling several pounds lighter!9-16-11  I have found that the only time this camera exposes well is when I am using daylight with manual controls.  It vignettes more than I at first thought, which is really annoying.  The compressed ratio of 7 on JPEGs  reduces the shadow detail to the point that it is often so muddy that a good shot is wasted for serious use.I can't really use it for anything serious, although I have to say it does a pretty decent job of shooting time-lapse scenes, which is fun, but not overly useful unless I decided to produce some low-budget Koyaanisqatsi.  I liked the food mode to start with, but it's incredibly difficult to balance light, again, not for serious use.  It's just a well-featured point-and-shoot, with no real use for a professional.One more thing, and it is now happening fairly often.  I am getting ther dreaded lens-jam and system-freeze.  This is not easy to fix, although I have been able to bring it back to operational with some fiddling each time.  This is not accptable.  I used to haul around an F5 and two F3s, and even being beaten ceasely by me in the field, the never failed.  They were real Nikons.  This is just something they threw out so point 'n shooters could pretend they had a Nikon.  I don't know what this, but it's not what I consider a real Nikon.I just purchased a D5100 which will replace it as my grab camera, another mistake.  I had hoped I could use it on a professional basis because of size and weight, but it doesn't have a depth of field button, which I need, the controls are more like point-and-shoot, and even with small hands it feels like am awkward grab-camera.  I'll upgrade it with a D7000...fell for the swivel screen and cheap price...my other bad.I've decided to give the P90 to my daughter.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Beginning Photographer!", "Author": "Edgar Flores", "ReviewID": "R1OSY41T9ZM59E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: It has incredible zoom capabilities, and it takes some of it's best pictures in natural light and at night.

The P90 handles focusing much better though I still encounter out-of-focus pictures more than I'd like.  I've set sharpen in the custom settings to help but the challenge with the camera is (1) where the focus point is and (2) in less than well-lit scenes, getting a meaningful focus point.I have owned a wide range of film and digital cameras over the past 40+ years.  Nikon, Minolta, Canon, Pentax, Olympus, and more.  My inclination is toward Nikon after owning an F5 for several years.  That said, while continuing to buy Nikon digital cameras (S6, P80, and now P90), they are admittedly challenging to use.  Focus, as mentioned, and lighting.The P90 seems to be the best so far.  Still not perfect, but an acceptable improvement.  I am finding that Shutter priority at 125/sec is working out nicely for many pictures, with and without a flash.  But I'm still experimenting.The P90 has great zoom capability from wide to telephoto.  Skip the back LCD display and use the eyepiece for steadier shots.  Better yet, just like the old days, USE A TRIPOD!I have not found, as have other reviewers, a problem with the lighting of the LCD display, nor am I troubled by the quality of the eyepiece display.  Both are very functional and the resulting picture is more a concern.I am bothered by Nikon (and other digital camera manufacturer) lack of lens threading to allow for a lens filter.  I have angst over carrying around an unprotected lens.Having to remove the lens cap to download pictures is a nuisance but a minor one.  If you have the camera already plugged into the computer when you turn it on you can leave the cap off.Battery life is short so I absolutely recommend at least one spare battery.  I typically carry two.  The battery and memory covery is oddly not self-locking.  You have to slide to lock cover to secure.I have taken a number of video shots and found the quality acceptable.  I'm sure it is not as good as my video camera but I do not take many and am not comfortable offering detailed commentary on it.Overall, this is a good camera, I'm not rushing out to look for a replacement (which was the case with the P80).

It boasts a swivel 3 inch LCD screen, a host of slr functions, can do 15fps at 3mp resolution, and, of course, has the 26mm to 624mm zoom lens, which is amazing in anyone's book.I bought the P90 after spending about 3 weeks debating whether or not I should have bought a dslr. Ultimately, I decided to save some money and go with a megazoom point and shoot instead. My rationale was that I was quite happy with the photos I've been taking with my Nikon S4, and then S10. I never print, so size wasnt an issue. While a dslr would be nice, it wasn't essential.I've taken about 200 photos and a short video. Initially, the photos I took were as horrible as I read- grainy and to be hoenst, crap. But the next day I put aside about an hour to take another 100 photos and by taking the time to actually frame a decent photo, I produced some pretty decent results. The focusing was reasonably quick, the swivel LCD screen is useful and the zoom was amazing. My photos had reasonable sharpness and detail (of course not dslr perfection).I'd like to make a few comments about comparing the P90 with dslr's and prosumer cameras.I've had some experience with 3 levels of digicams- point and shoots (Nikon S4, S10), prosumers (Sony dsc 828), and dslr's (Canon Eos 350D, Sony alpha 300).Regarding the quality of the photos, you can usually see an improvement in the detail of the photo as you go from point and shoot, to prosumer, to finally, dslr.From my viewpoint, I'd regard the megazooms like the P90 and Sony HX1 as point and shoots with a long range zoom lens attached. If you think about it, it makes sense.Imagine one of the multitude of 1cm thick point and shoot cameras out there. Then add on a huge zoom lens, thicken the grip for better handling of the extra weight, a dial for some slr functions, and hey presto! a mega zoom point and shoot.Now look at the body of the P90.The body's about 1cm thick- same as all the other point and shoots out there.Now look at the serious prosumer cameras and dlsrs. Their bodies are much thicker, and also have larger sensors. HEnce the quality is better.So while it's easy to assume that megazoom means mega quality, look at the other aspects of the camera to see if your expectations are realistic.If you've made it this far, thanks for reading :)July 30th, 2009---------------I've taken over 1000 photos now, as I've been sightseeing in Singapore and Guangzhou, China. To show you what this camera can produce, I've uploaded a handful of photos in a Flickr set. It shows how awesome the zoom is, but, unfortunately, may not satisfy those who claim lots of noise, as I'm using the free version and it wont allow viewing at full res. Nevertheless, a picture is worth a thousand words, so I'll let them do the talking:[...]", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Terrible purchase", "Author": "A. Faber \"Stamper\"", "ReviewID": "R1V7K7S8MB2LMP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I researched this camera, read the reviews and decided it sounded good despite the negative reviews.  I received one camera a couple of weeks ago, took pictures and LOVED it!  So I uploaded the pictures into my computer and they were terrible.  They had chunks of the picture that were discolored and looked like they were not in the same place at the rest of the picture.  So I tried all sorts of things to figure out if it was my computer, the camera, the card, etc.  I printed them at the store... fine.  I uninstalled the software and uploaded the newest version and I called customer support.  They told me to send it in for repair.  I did not want to that because it was BRAND NEW, so I returned it.  Amazon shipped me another one super fast and I received it a few days later.  Uploaded my pictures... same problem.  The computer says they are corrupted.  I call customer support and they tell me that the memory card I am using is not authorized for the camera and that's the problem.  So they recommend I take out the card and use the internal memory of the camera to take pics, upload them and it should be fine.  So I do this and they are the same as the other bad ones.  So I call customer support again and they tell me that \"this is strange\" and that I need to send it in for repair.  So I have two of these cameras and they both do this.  I want to keep the camera because I really liked it, but two cameras in a row doing this has made me lose all confidence in the camera.  Could the problem be in my computer?  Maybe... they don't know, but they don't think so.  The only way to find out is to send it in for repair and if they can't find anything wrong, it must be something in my computer or software but they don't know how to tell me to check that or fix it.  And by the time I get it back from repair, it is past the return deadline for Amazon, so I'm stuck with it if it doesn't work.  I'm bummed because it was a very promising camera.  Wonder if anyone else has had this problem??

So I went over to get it but it was unavailable. I decided to take a shot and get it. I have never been happier with this camera. I can take far away pictures with great quality but I can also take close ups of flowers with near SLR quality. The picture quality in any picture is great. Some complain about 24x photos inside...thats because thats not the use for it. I have taken pictures of flowers, orioles, the moon, and a lot of other things. I would invest in this camera and an 8 GB memory card. You'll need it. The wide angle lens is a HUGE plus.The only cons to this camera is: its kinda big and heavy.

I walk a lot about lakes where thee are a variety of Eagles, Ospreys, hawks, and water fowl. I can whip out my P90, and fill a frame with an eagle on a limb and freeze it.  I've decided to make the P90 my main \"carry along\" camera for my walks where I might see a bird or animal I want to capture. I highly recommend it. One thing I was caught off guard by is that it uses the newer HC SD cards, which won't work in the Nikon D50 and may not work in older memory card readers either. I found that out quickly trying to import pictures into my computer to edit. Get a new SD card reader when you buy the camera. The camera also does NOT come with a memory card, I assume to hold down the buying price. A 2 GB card is plenty of capacity.

I am studying the manual today to learn how to use all the other features and capabilities and I am sure it will be a joy to use. My previous camera was a Kodak DX6490 which is a great camera but began acting a little flaky. So, it was time for a new, upgraded camera. The P90 has an excellent \"feel\", very solid and a bit hefty which makes it seem like a \"real\" camera. I took a few sample pictures and they look great. I got it from Amazon at a very good price compared to the local retailers in my area. Included are the battery, charger, lens cap, neck strap, A/V cable and USB cable. I had a 2 GB SD card which, according to the display, would hold about 350 pictures at the highest quality and resolution. I have ordered an 8 GB card and extra batteries so I will be prepared for the little league season coming up.

It will actually take about 1500 + on a charge using sports mode, but that's probably because it just zipping away, and you take 20-30 photos in the same amount of time you take just one under normal circumstances.Get a camera bag and tripod with grippy legs.

It is also very handy when taking photos when you have to hold the camera above your head to view over brush or branches in the way.Two things I was disappointed in were night shots without flash and the software provided.  The camera has the capability to operate at very high ASA settings which should allow better pictures at night, but the camera doesn't automatically adjust this way when in the program mode - I need to study further to make it work.  The software supplied is basically a transfer program, no editing functions that I could find.

Once downtown to test drive the camera. Loved the 24x zoom. Stood on the 16th floor of the hotel and took shots of downtown New Orleans. Picture quality was awesome. Second test drive was to my daughters fashion show. The outdoor shots were amazing. Indoor during the fashion show was horrible. Not sure if it was me, but I couldn't get any of the settings to give me a decent shot. Let me state this, I am a novice photographer at best. I'm sure skills may play a major role here. The third test was taking the camera to Disney World. Again, the zoom and tilt screen came in really handing when trying to get a good shot of the characters during the parade. I was able to raise the camera above the crowds and just tilt down to aim my shots. The zoom switch was great for one hand handling. The auto focus or anti-shaking function (whatever it's called) saves the day. Having said all that, I always returned the camera to the carrying case when it wasn't in use which made it a bit of a hassle to try to snap something when I was on the rides.

I really wanted to compare this camera's zoom capability to my Nikon D200 with its 18-200 lens. At times I crop the shots taken on the D200 at a high magnification. I didn't want the weight or the cost in a 600mm or greater lens for the D200. This camera was able to fill that need.

I had been considering a digital SLR (Nikon D80), but after using one from a friend I decided that the weight and size might deter me from carrying it very often.  There was also an issue of cost.  The P90 costs from 1/3 as much as the digital SLR.Features I like:1. Sturdy feel and smooth functioning. Controls are convenient with many functional options.2. 12.5X optical zoom. I don't use digital zoom.3. Image stabilization4. Ability to switch from screen to viewfinder to view images (the viewfinder shows the same digital image as the screen).  I have been using a viewfinder for 60 years and I prefer it to trying to look at the screen, especially in bright sun.  I wouldn't have a camera without a viewfinder.5. Quick focusing compared to other digital cameras that I have used.6. Uses SD cards (which I prefer to xD)7. Large screen that tilts.  The tilt is a great feature.  The screen can be tilted up or down by 90 degrees.  This is particularly useful when trying to hold the camera up over a crowd.  It also makes \"wormseye views\" convenient and painless.Features I don't like:1. Uses proprietary battery (however, I found an aftermarket battery on Amazon for $5.00 instead of about $30 for the Nikon battery).  The aftermarket fits perfectly, but I haven't used it enough to comment on lifespan and durability.2. No provision to add filters to the lens.3. No SD card included with the camera.  However, the camera does have some internal memory.All in all, I think that this camera is a very strong upper level amateur performer.  Except for using some very specialized interchangeable lenses, it can do most things that the digital SLR can do and do it faster and with less bulk.  Tamrac makes a case that fits almost exactly (like the camera, available on Amazon).  Not everyone feels that a case is necessary, but I find it handy for carrying the camera and a few accessories when not in use.All in all, I am very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is an outstanding point and shoot and a great backup.", "Author": "Richard M.

And if you turn on the camera and leave the lens cap on, the lcd screen says you have to turn the camera off and take the lens cap off and turn the camera back on. kind of annoying.Besides all that, it really does take great pictures. My wife was jumping up and down with how fast it shoots. We got a picture of our 8 year old in mid ollie (skateboard jump), they were both totally stoked. We have 3 little kids and you have to take a picture really quick sometimes if you want a cool picture.

Packaging: I bought mine at a \"box\" discount house, requiring a membership fee and home to the $1.50 Hot Dog & Drink!  The camera came with a case, 2 gig memory card, battery & charger, instruction book?, and software for about $350. A great buy!  I am a 67 yr. old, retired (film) wedding photographer. I own two digital cameras, a small \"shirt -pocket\" and a Fuji S-20 Pro. First let me say, SET THE WHITE BALANCE first! I read a review of the P90 where all the pictures came out washed out with an \"over-exposed\" look! That reviewer then returned the camera. Had he set the white balance he may still own the camera. I have no doubt this is a fine camera, but as with all the digital cameras of this day, the mfr's pack too many features into one camera. This is the case here. To get back to the book, had Nikon hired a USA-born \"tech writer\" I might have keep the camera and struggled to learn all its features. I like to photocopy certain pages of the book and make my own \"reference\" book,with LARGER type,  which I have spiral bound @ the local big box stationary store. The way the book is bound made it difficult to do this. I went to Nikon's web site and downloaded the instruction book but was unable to print a few pages. Nikon put some \"blocks\" into their program which prevented me from doing this. I did take a few pictures outside and rushed them to the local quick photo place. The color was GREAT! However the sharpness seemed a bit soft. The layout of the \"menu\" button  is better than with the cameras I own in that it is basic  two button affair, but how to access it and use it is a mess to try & understand. I give up, packed up the P90 and will return it today! I love reading the reviews because I pick up some good tid-bits. One other point, in evaluating a camera. I make a 11 x 14 print of one of the test pictures! AT $4 or $5 dollars I find out pretty quick if I should keep the camera!

It was my intention to use this camera to replace my Digital Canon SLR.  I loved the idea of everything it offered.  Seemed to be a perfect replacement and would give me more and easier to use.I played with it for about two weeks and each time I picked it up I had more questions about its capabilities.  Yesterday I tried it out at a \"Cheerleader\" competition and decided it was not for me.  It simply did not return the results that I felt it should return.  Focusing was slow, the pictures were grainy, the LCD was not clear, neither the \"Movie or \"Sport\" worked to my satisfaction.  Actually I did not get a usable photo or series that I thought was up to par and most were just short of terrible.  Since I really purchased it for these things - I decided it was not for me so I am returning it.  I believe the problems are with the P90 as a whole and not a problem of this individual camera.Now it may well be a really perfect camera for the average person who was using it for the run-of-the-mill photos.  The long zoom, etc. would be good for these enthusiasts. However I would put myself more into the expert category expecting certain things out of a camera and this one did not deliver to my expectations.At the same time I was shooting with the Nikon my wife was using an older model of a competitor with a 18X Zoom.  In all areas of taking the pictures, which were basically the same for both of us, her camera gave better clearer pictures - now when the competitor comes out with a 24X zoom - I will take a close look but may not be so quick to buy until I see reviews and results from others.It really hurts me to return this Nikon camera as it was the camera for me to love - but it just wasn't for me - but I will keep looking for that perfect camera mate.

I was actually considering a Canon SX10 or SX1, but I chose the P90 because I wanted the time-lapse movies and timed-interval still shots. Neither of the Canons has those two features. My pictures look fine for a less-than-$400 camera, and under all lighting conditions. I know I could get less noise and better detail at ISO 1600 with a camera that costs two or three times as much and requires me to change lenses to get the focal length range of the P90.

Not in a good way. I tried the camera in low to moderate light - it took a long time to focus, and many shots turned out blurry. The camera was working hard to take the pictures. I tried the camera in bright daylight. Near shots were overexposed, and zoomed shots again took a long time to focus, and still turned out blurry. And the insidious red halo returned on the white patch of a duck's face. In addition, I couldn't really tell if the pictures I was taking were in focus, or even on the screen completely, when I was at max zoom. On my Canon, at max zoom I didn't have the images clear before I snapped the shot - but when I looked at the screen the resolution was much clearer and the image stabilization more effective.Yes, I know the soom isn't as great - and that comparing the max of one to the other isn't a fair comparison. Yes, there may be settings internal to the camera to help resolve these issues.
