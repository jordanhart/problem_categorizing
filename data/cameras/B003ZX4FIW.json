I really feel this camera has been made to my taste. It's impossibly tiny, lightweight and has sexy interchangable lens. The photos from this camera capture a lot of details and with 14.2 megapixels you have plenty cropping options. Image quality was at first too soft to my liking, but this can be easily fixed with some manual adjustment of the Sharpness/Contrast/etc setting. Just look up which setting works best in some online forums. I also have to confess that 95% of the time I rely on the camera's iAuto mode (intelligent Auto) - the camera has been able to correctly focus and apply all the appropriate settings, very quickly. So I'm now merrily shooting away whatever I fancy. The Sony lens are really fun to use. Between the 16mm pancake and 18-55mm zoom, i prefer the former. As said, because this camera captures such amazing details, I can afford to absorb everything in a wide angle then crop later. The wide lens is slightly flawed with a bit of barrel distortion if you look hard enough, but honestly I'm least bothered because it's not so evident that it ruins my pictures. Nonetheless I plan to invest in some NEX adaptors for better (and more expensive) lens (cos i'm in love with the body!). The camera comes with a detachable flash and a shoulder strap, very thoughtful Sony. The flash piece is secured by a hand screw, so if you like having flash it can stay there on the camera with no worry of falling off. Because this camera takes great low-light pictures and I like the natural look of things, I never used the flash piece. Lastly, the body of the NEX-5 is so sturdy and sexy-looking. It has suffered bumps in my travelling bag and falling off a 3ft height once, and it's still working fine (thank God!). And oh I can't end without saying I'm just blown away by the Sweep Panaroma function.A tip: I updated the firmware to version 03 and the battery seems to hold longer than before. It lasted me a full-day in snapping frenzy Vegas.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,285.86", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony Alpha NEX-5 Digital Camera Body & E 16mm f/2.8 Lens (Silver) with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS Zoom Lens", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/319CXZvBW3L.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ZX4FIW"}}
