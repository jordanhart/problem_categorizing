Geary", "ReviewID": "R1PAJSE0YR67ZN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to rate the Lytro camera highly based on how neat and innovative the idea behind it is, but in the end I just can't figure out how this camera is something other than a novelty. This camera is essentially a cute 3D-Instagram-camera, and it can post nifty 3D photos to Facebook, and that's about it. However, the product is still in development so it at least looks promising that future software updates could do a lot to improve the experience. It is clear that the camera captures much more information in the 3D-lightfield than the current software setup is capable of processing or making use of.The Lytro camera captures 3D light information, and this 3D-image is processed by using computationally intensive software (it takes several minutes per photo), generating a \"living picture\" in which you can refocus the image at will on your computer. The final image is only 1080x1080 pixels. Your images also must be viewed in either a web-browser or in the included software through a smallish 500x500 pixel window. The desktop software currently has no image editing capabilities other than rotate 90\u00b0, and does not have the ability to adjust white balance, contrast or brightness.The software does include the ability to export a refocused image to JPG format, but the JPG compression leads to some blurring. The software currently lacks the ability to output to any other file format options. It is possible the developers will have future updates addressing this issue.Another limitation that is noteworthy is that the fastest shutter speed is 1/250sec, which means that it can be difficult to get sharp photos by hand-holding the device.In the end, I sent the camera back. I think it's a really innovative idea, but the software really isn't ready for the masses and the product doesn't yet have the right features that would make it worth the expensive price tag. I really wanted to like this product, and I tried to like it, but it's clearly not for me.

So do your research!", "Author": "Grzegorz Tokarski \"GregT\"", "ReviewID": "R1J30H7HAJH0V5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned a Lytro for about 5-6 months now, after eagerly pre-ordering it last October. I am big into taking pictures of my 2 kids (4 and 6) and am starting to do more photos of insects, birds, nature stuff I notice... I am not anywhere near a \"professional\" photographer, or even a very proficient. I take a lof of pictures with Canon sx230HS, but I got very impressed with the new opportunities when I read about LYTRO technology. The ability to refocus, hence have \"multiple pictures in one\", the possibility to unlock new possibilities with the future software releases (like 3D, \"allinfocus\"), as well as adding functionality to the camera with firmware updates, like just added manual settings mode - the technology seemed very exciting. This is something that has never been done before.I do get frustrated sometimes with the light glare on the LCD, and the inability to really evaluate the images on the camera due to the small LCD. Also the processing time required on a PC can be annoying at times... but this is a new way of thinking and an opportunity to be a part of something groundbreaking.The quality of pictures, as compared to digital photography of even point-and-shoot cameras, is certainly not there, as you can only get a static image of 1080x1080.. but that is NOT the point of LYTRO.. The point of it is to \"tell a story in a different way\". Once you get over that and actually think in the way Lytro enables you too, the fact that the images can be shared only through Lytro's website (which you get access to, and storage on, when you get the camera), as well as the \"insufficient\" megapixels, and noticeable grain in the images when lighting is not perfect... that all dissolves when you adjust your thinking - but only then. It's really not even about the initial \"wow\" effect of the abilities of the camera.. it's more about the \"image revolution\" that this device may create in the photography world.I am actually learning about photography and becoming more interested in it because of this camera.Being able to take part in few Beta evaluations for Lytro was quite an experience as well.. and simply keeps showing me that comparing it to, or attempting to replace a current camera with this one, is not the goal here.. Which seems to confuse a lot of users who were considering or even ordered the camera and then decided to return it due to image quality or just not meeting their expectations...Also realize you HAVE to have a MAC with certain level of OS or a Windows7 64bit PC to use the software. The memory is not expandable, the battery not replaceable... cannot attach filters and lenses \"as is\". There are more and more accessories, like a tripod mount, wall charger, people have made \"LED lights\" for it... so the market \"around it\" is growing.So make sure and look through Lytro's web site - support forums, knowledge articles, how tos, galleries, whether Lytro is right for you! But, if you decide you want to try it, you will probably not be disappointed. If however the photo size and the quality are huge for you - hold off till the future hardware releases - in case they do manage to put a larger CCD in there and add other hardware improvements.Definitely DO NOT buy it blindly only reading the Amazon description and specs.. that will not give you the full picture of what you are getting and may skewed your expectations big time!Oh, and if you get it, prepare for a relatively high learning curve.. that goes for the way of thinking even more than the actual skill to use the camera in a \"technical\" sense of the world... although, that is a part of it too ;)I hope this review is helpful to you, and that if you do get the camera - you will enjoy it!Happy decision making and have fun if you get it!", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing, but with one small problem", "Author": "S. M. McCroskey \"Mia Mc\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZEHPCAQ6UQF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I read about the Lytro its coolness factor made it a \"must have\" addition to my hobbiest photo bag. As another reviewer pointed out, when you point this red rectangle at subjects in public you attract attention. The non-photographers glaze over quickly -- it's often difficult to see the refocusing effect on the viewfinder, and they just don't get it. But I've also heard \"you mean the light field camera exists? I thought it was just theory!\" and \"you've got one! Can I see it?\"The Lytro is not an easy camera to be successful with. Go skim the public gallery at [...] and be amazed at the depth-of-field tricks. Then try to duplicate those fantastic images. Keep trying. Try different subjects. As someone else said, you have to change your composition thought process for this camera. You have to look at everything, and look for contrasts. My impulse is to shoot rows of similar things -- a row of terra cotta warrior statues, a bush covered in flowers. But many of the more striking images are of contrast -- the thing in the foreground provides commentary on the surprising thing in the distance, once you refocus. That kind of composition is much harder. Also, what about the lighting conditions? When it's bright, the Lytro can capture everything in sharp focus at once -- at least that's my experience.Originally in this review I had said that you can't export your images to a common, \"flat\" format. It turns out you can: In the desktop software (not on the Lytro web site), pick a focal point in an image, return to the library view, and right click to select Export JPG. Unfortunately, the resulting image is not very big -- about 3.5 x 3.5 inches at 300 dpi. You won't be able to make a big, beautiful print to frame. But it's suitable for social media and email.So what's the problem? You're going to lose the lens cap. It's this totally cool magnetized rubber square that falls off at the slightest nudge. An A+ for sleek design. An F for utility. Check the support forums -- you'll see that so many early buyers complained of this, Lytro sent out free replacements. Lytro says they'll do a redesign, but we early buyers can try a piece of duct tape along the bottom edge of the cap folded onto the camera. Then it can flap down for shooting. Effective, if ugly. Or put a lens cap leash on it (and use some extra strong glue, because the stick-um comes detached from the rubber).That negativity out of the way, I'll conclude that I love this thing for making me look at things differently. It's always with me, even when I leave the big Nikon behind.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fun gadget but not a real camera", "Author": "Marcelo W. De Brisac", "ReviewID": "R5T22EEU52427", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a Nikon D-90 that I never expected to replace my my Lytro. I also have an Olympus Z1 mirror-less SLR that I thought would be replaced by my Lytro, but not really.After the fact focus is a nice feature and works perfectly, with kids at home, every now and then you miss that perfect photo because the camera auto focus feature selected the wrong spot and that is it, not only did you lose a few seconds before the photo, but by the time you realize the problem the kids are gone. With Lytro you can take pictures in less than a second and be confident you can fix the focus later.Unfortunately, that is all the camera does. Even though Lytro claims the camera does not have a flash and can handle several light conditions, that is not true. The camera just takes extremely grainy pictures inside and if the subject moves a little, you'll probably have a blurry image.For outdoors, the camera tends to work well, but of course, since you do not have a flash, you cannot compensate for light backgrounds, so the limits what you can do a little.If that was all, I'd still be happy with the camera, knowing it is for outdoor use only. But there is more, you can only download the pictures to the Lytro software (which is reasonable since you still have to adjust the focus), but you have no editing capabilities on that software. But that is still not a huge issue since you'd still probably export the images after you set the focus to put them together with your photo library and share them in your TV or iPad.And here is the major problem with Lytro, it exports a low resolution (1080x1080) JPEG with a lot of compression (each picture takes around 100k) which makes the photos pretty useless, you cannot print them, you cannot show them on your iPad, the most you can do is post them on facebook, but most cell phone photos will look better than yours. Add to that the fact that the Lytro program doesn't let you batch export the photos or batch delete them and you will have a lot of headaches.The camera is well build (the display is too small) but the form factor does not make it nice to carry in your pocket for instance, and pretty much everyone has lost the magnetic lens cover at least once (but the very nice people for Lytro support have replaced them for free).But I still use my Lytro a lot, because it is so simple. I'd give it four stars if the final resolution of the exported images were better and five stars if it had a flash (which does not seem to be an easy thing, since the camera does not focus on the image, it does not know the subject distance and therefore cannot set the flash intensity), but I'd still like to have a flash, even if I had to set the focus before shooting in that case.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lytro is the future of the camera!", "Author": "K.

I was attracted to the camera by the reviews and the galleries on its website. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make the camera do the wonder it said it would. It could totally be me --- being busy and impatient and so on. Nevertheless, Lytro is far from being \"aim-shoot-and-wow\". For example, I could only get multiple focus effect if the objects were sufficiently far apart AND at least one of the them was fairly close (less than 3 feet away). Even the best Lytro pictures, they lack of the clarify (resolution), contrast, color saturation that I expect from mainstream aim-and-shoot cameras. And the image quality deteriorates fast when lighting condition is subpar. For example, a picture taken in a cloudy afternoon in a sunroom turned out very grainy. All in all, I may not talk people out of buying if they are interested in new toys.

Second is the software and the web posting feature.  I got my Lytro last April and all you have to do is plug it into your computer.  The software is in the camera and is downloaded automatically.  And you get updates.  Both my camera and my laptop software have been updated by Lytro multiple times, seamlessly and always adding on new features and controls.  The software is designed to make sharing via web posting, social network, and email really easy.  They gave me a web space to post to and my friends can go there and play with the pictures.The reason to buy a Lytro is strictly for fun.I'm a professional and a collector so I know what I'm buying.  Lytro photos are only about 1080x1080, so they're not huge and maybe not so good for a large print (I print them as 3x3 in).  And if you do want to print one you have to export them out of the desktop software as a jpeg to do it.  The lens cap isn't all that secure and I'm concerned about losing it.  There is no flash, and no it doesn't shoot video.  The camera doesn't do as well in low light or high key situations.  But I took mine to a Galactic show in a dark club and still got some really cool shots of the band even though some of them were grainy.  (I was standing right up front against the stage mind you.)Despite what some would consider drawbacks about this system, many, many wonderful photographs have been made with these cameras.  Just look at their website.  But the way I approach it is that the camera is for fun.  The photos look great, they're fun to play with (they now have filters and perspective shift to play with too), they're easy to share on line, and you can be creative with some manual control capability and other features.  I like that the format is square.The Lytro shutter release is on top along with a very cool and nearly invisible zoom control, there's no focus time so you can shoot away like crazy, and the viewer is a touch screen where you can review photos with a swipe or access the other controls.  The design and construction materials are just cool.I'm learning new things every time I use this camera and it does some voodoo on you that forces you to find ways to be creative.

I got really excited when I read about the refocusing capabilities of light field cameras even before the first Lytro was shipped. The Lytro has certainly lived up to expectations in this aspect. Taking pictures that are interesting to refocus is a new skill to be learnt, and I must say that I had fun experimenting with it. The software is good, and I really appreciate the firmware upgrades that added new features like the new manual mode.

The picture quality is far from acceptable. You could buy a pretty good point and shoot camera for its price.

I also work selling cameras to hundreds of people every month at one of the department stores. I bought this camera in February of 2012. I didn't buy this camera to replace my main camera, a Canon T3i, or to even replace my secondary camera, a Canon EOS 5. This camera goes along with my AE-1 and my large format Pony Premo No.1; they are fun and exciting cameras that I use from time to time. This camera, for me, was a unique piece of photography history that I wanted a piece of. To tell the truth, I bought the camera for two reasons; to have the first model of the technology if it becomes popular, or to have the only model of a failed experiment if it fails in the photography world.If you are considering buying this camera for its uniqueness and ability to refocus after the photo has been taken, then I say get it. If you are thinking about buying this camera because you want to use it soley to take pictures with on a day to day basis, consider a more traditional camera that will perform better.In the end it matters whether you will regret if you did or didn't get it.

I love cameras, and I've had a Lytro for a while now. Basically, what this \"light field\" camera does is the same thing that used to be done by cinematographers in the \"old days\" of changing the focus on a fixed stationary scene while running at a high frame rate, thus making a series of \"identical\" stills each of which had a different focal point. You could do the same with a modern digital camera. You can then use that series of stills, in whole or in part, to do what the Lytro camera + software does, namely, post-capture dynamically refocus all or part of the field of view. The difference with the \"old way\" is really that you had to know what you were doing, and do a lot of work, in a darkroom or (in the digital version) with software you wrote yourself. The Lytro camera does the equivalent via a different (and optically parallel) method, but it's basically the same stunt. The \"old\" method was slower but allowed full use of the resolution of the film (or focal plane array sensor). The Lytro optically parallel method is faster but trades off optical resolution as the image sensor has to be divided up in a manner too complicated to describe here, but the result is that a many megapixel sensor in a Lytro camera only produces a one megapixel image at any focus. The net effect is that the Lytro is a very expensive equivalent of a Kodak Instamatic with the additional feature of allowing refocusing of lytro's proprietary image files, via Lytro's special software, after the snapshot has been take. But make no mistake - any JPG's you create from the Lytro camera will be pretty mediocre 1080 x 1080 pixel snapshots. So is it worth the high price? That really depends on how much you value novelty. I like my Lytro, but would I take it birding? No, I take my Canon PowerShot SX50 HS birding. Would I take it to the beach, skiing or kayaking? No, I take my water proof Canon Powershot D10 for those things (lesson learned after destroying a few non-water proof Nikons).

The Lytro makes this easier, as focus can be achieved after the fact.  I provided a thorough review of the Lytro here (campus.albion.edu/wjwilson/2012/05/10/initial-thoughts-on-lytro/), including some sample shots, so I will not repeat myself in this review.What I _will_ say here is that the Lytro grows on you.  The quality of jpegs pulled from the images is low (about 1 megapixel) but the ease of shooting without focusing, the speed of shooting because the camera does not take time to focus, and the capability to focus after the fact make up for this.  Plus images can be edited (brightness, contrast, cropping, etc.) in your favorite photo-manipulating software once a jpeg has been saved.The camera is very user-friendly, both in its functions and in the desktop software.  Plug the Lytro in to your USB port and it loads the desktop software automagically.  Lytro is constantly updating the software to improve usability.  Manual control exposure was recently added to the camera - this feature was added to my camera when I plugged it in to the computer and was informed that an upgrade was available. It seems that the Lytro folks are working hard to provide the user with an experience that is easy.So why no 5-star rating?  Perhaps I expect too much, but I would love to see a higher resolution in the jpegs that can be produced.  I expect that future versions will allow this.  Also, as some have suggested, the zoom slider is easy to move by accident, and it is relatively slow to zoom.  These are not serious issues, and should not deter someone who want to experience this new technology.  Unlike other reviewers, I think it does pretty well in low-light settings -- yes, there is \"grain,\" and a Lytro-specific artifact that reflects the light-field capturing array of lenses inside the camera, but I have shot musical performances in outdoor night-time settings with poor lighting and have gotten usable shots.This is a camera worth having, and you will discover that you look at photography differently once you get used to the idea that you can focus after-the-fact.  I find myself using it expressly for this purpose at times, and for the convenience of rapid point-and-shoot at other times.

(Remember there is no flash, and it gets really grainy without enough light.)Although you don't need to focus you need to think about the shot in whole. The Lytro I believe, forces you to take more interesting shots, so in a way you may get better both while using the Lytro and with your other cameras (like the one on your phone)Pros:There is a cool factor in having an emerging tech before the masses.The shots are really fun to play with and have almost a tactile nature to them because you can change the focus.The pictures are really crisp with great lighting.The Lytro contains the needed software and auto plays the first time you plug it in to your computer, and has updates to improve the camera functionality.(I imagine a lot can be done through the updates without buying the next version.)The Lytro is fairly easy to use one handed once you learn the simple interface.Well thought out shots pay off and really impress. (again there is a cool factor)Cons:You need enough light to get a shot, but this is with anything so plan ahead.Moving objects are hard to capture.There is a VERY long load and processing time once pictures are transferred to your computer, so expect that. ( but then again try to wrap your head around huge amount of data is being processed)The LCD display is lacking in resolution & brightness, but it gets the job done. You are not going to blow someone's mind with the \"Living Picture\" aspect using the LCD display.In all I would say that not only are we keeping the Lytro; we will be using it a lot more that we use our cyber shot.

The photos tend to be very grainy, unless you're out in broad daylight, which we only get two months of in Seattle.2. It's hard to set up a scene where the light field actually adds something, so the scenes you end up staging have a lot of whiz-bang factor. You won't get a really good light field of something that happens organically - you have to stage it.3. The software is clunky and confusing. I was expecting to plug in my camera and have scenes pop out of it automagically. Instead you wait several minutes for your pictures to download into the software, several more while the software does some heavy processing and your computer's fan spins up to keep the processor cool, and then you come back to it later to look at all your failed shots (and one or two okay or good ones).The excessive processing time on a real computer is startling, because you can kinda look at the photos right on the camera, and you can process them in less time on an iPod Touch and share them in some neat ways, like some kind of wiggle gif, or a sliding refocus gif (can't do that with the software, nor with their cloud platform - iOS only). They should have put all the processing into either the camera or the cloud and made it as fast and pleasant as possible. Instead they made a camera, and they made some software that kinda does a job, if you don't mind waiting.4. They did WiFi exactly completely wrong, and as an afterthought. They could have implemented something akin to EyeFi, or WiFi Direct, but instead the camera can become a wireless access point, and you can pull your iPhone off the Internet while it connects exclusively to the camera to do one thing only - download your images. I can't imagine a worse way to use a WiFi radio.I really want Lytro to succeed - it would be so cool to snap a shot, have it look great, even in low light, and share it on your favorite social network immediately, but Lytro falls far short of that. I hope they do make it soon, but they'll have to do it without my money.

We noticed that this camera gets mixed reviews and they seem to based on user expectations and desired end products.  After holding back more than a year while considering mixed reviews, we finally took the leap and got one.  We have been AMAZED at the fine detail in the macro shots we have got so far. The Lytro does have a bit of a experimental learning curve of taking photos and seeing the results, then taking more photos, to get to a place where you can visualize the shot with confidence before seeing it on a computer screen.  The 3D, refocus, and perspective features are novel and easy to use.  We have also figured out how to make some great 2D 10\"x10\" enlargements using the Resize tools available in Perfect Photo Suite software (found that tip on the Lytro blog site).  One of the best things about photography is using creativity to see everyday things differently and appreciating the beauty around us.  This camera is perfect for that and easy enough for my kids (9 & 11) to use too.

It allows you to take \"live pictures\", that allow you to select where you want to focus at after the picture is taken. It also allows one to slightly change the perspective from which you see the scene, so that you may move up/down and sideways slightly changing the angle in which you see the scene. That gives quite a 3D view of the scene. If you take two of the views (left/right for instance) you can easily create a 3D image (using an appropriate display that is). This version of the camera has 16GB of memory,which is rated to hold 750 live pictures. While the 8GB versions of the camera hold around 350 live pictures, the price different makes this version worth it. It would be nice if we could choose the colour we prefer though (as of now the 16GB camera is only build in Red Hot colour).You get better results if yo utake pictures that include some object(s) very close to the camera and some other(s) pretty far from it. If you have three or more distance layers things get even more interesting. You can see your live pictures in your computer or publish them in the Lytro website, from where you can share it with friends.

Winton \"cwinton\"", "ReviewID": "R115OBDNJWMAW9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The concept of this camera is decidedly cool, but at this point in time the reality of what it produces comes up well short.  I was able to shoot pictures with it as soon as I had it out of the packaging, so it gets high marks for being intuitive.  Setting up the software for my desktop was equally simple, downloaded from the Lytro website the first time I plugged the camera into a USB port.  The software is pretty minimal, but does allow you to pick the part of the image you want focused, and you can then export that frame as a .jpg file, probably comparable to what you would get from the worst digital camera you've ever used; i.e., export is an almost worthless \"feature\".  Just remember that your typical flat panel display has more than the one megapixel resolution of this camera's images.  The image data for each picture takes up about 17Mb, indicating the camera collects 15 frames of data for each picture.  At 8Gb of storage, the camera can hold over 350 pictures, which should be ample for most needs.  As you import images to your desktop, you can have them deleted from the camera, or more painfully, delete them manually from the camera as you view them.The camera itself is physically interesting in appearance and provides easy to use controls.  Others have commented on the limitations of the viewfinder, the rather insensitive touch screen, and the easily lost lens cap (which will come off and stick in the supplied case, incidentally), so I won't comment further on camera design.What I do find interesting in the software is the ability to set perspective shift for an image, which provides means for the software to bring everything in the image into focus, something truly entertaining (think in terms of the proverbial garden gnome in the very near foreground with the Eiffel tower in the background all in focus and you get the idea).  This feature also enables 3-D viewing on devices that are 3-D capable.  The software is too dumb to render what you see this way as a .jpg, but by going to full screen, doing a screen capture, and cropping the image out using a photo editor you can get a good 1 megapixel .jpg image.  If the software were only a bit more intelligent, you could select which parts of the image to have in focus.If your interest is serious photography, spend your money elsewhere.  If you want something a bit novel, and don't mind the price tag, you will find you can produce some kinds of pictures you simply can't do with a conventional camera.  Just keep in mind the camera does poorly with moving objects and needs reasonably good light.  Even for casual snapshots you should think first in terms of using your phone camera or a point and shoot, although it's easy to visualize settings where this camera would be the better choice.One more thing, there is no Android software yet (almost a deal breaker for me).  The current software release is for iOS, OS X and 64-bit Windows 7 or 8.

But as a camera, it is largely impractical and the software lacks elegance. Following is a summary of my observations.Upgrading to Windows 8 after you load pictures on your PC may hide your lytros pictures. The files are hidden on your computer in the c:\\windows.old\\users\\[username]\\appdata\\local\\lytro folder. There is no way you could know this without me or calling support. Reinstalling them is another archaic chore.Images are small. Due to the technology, the files are huge but the actual pixels up and down is quite small. You can get a bigger photo from your iphone.Can't transfer images. The file format is proprietary and doesn't import to anything else on your computer. So they won't show up in Windows photo gallery, photoshop, or any other image display or manipulation tool. So what you see is what you get. You can export them to low res jpgs and work with them, but they are pretty low res.Printing the images is possible, but cumbersome. You can export to jpeg only from the library view by right clicking. Its unintuitive. Then you get a pretty low res image which you can crop, print, or send to Walgreens.The camera is weak. The lens seems to be nice, but only works when the camera is held really still and in great light. Yet the camera does not offer a tripod connector or a flash option. So most photos taken look horrid.The effect is weak. When it works its badassed, but an object has to be less than 3 feet from the lens for it to work. That's not the way we generally take pictures. IN general, photos of people look and act exactly the same as they do with your iphone.In the end, this is a toy for gadget guys and not a camera for using in any camera necessary setting.

What?!)The coolest feature is, obviously, being able to focus after the fact.  The sensitivity is very poor, so that rules out action shots, and therefore the time saved from not having to focus really isn't relevant.  Regardless of the post-capture focusing, the camera still does need to perform a pre-capture coarse focus so that the focal depth is at least reasonably close to the subject.  If it matters to you, it's pretty quick.If you want to imagine what the camera is really capturing, it is analogous to taking many identical pictures while changing your manual focus - this camera does it all simultaneously.  By analyzing what is blurry or focused in each image, the software is able to determine how far away each object is, which allows for rudimentary 3D-space computation, such as the perspective shift and depth-based image effects.The zoom feature is nearly impossible to use - I haven't figured out the trick to get the touchscreen to handle it reliably.The PC software is quite oversimplified, but it lets you fiddle with focus and various depth-related filters.  While these filters definitely can improve your photo, it's far from the kind of filtering you can get even from cheap Photoshop knock offs.  And then, it makes it easy to post to Facebook, but I can't find any kind of \"save this picture\" menu item.  It seems easier to capture a screenshot.After all of the above, your final Lytro pictures are the low-quality equivalent of photos taken with any other camera.If the camera is good for anything, it would be its ability to perform focus stacking, where multiple focal depths are combined to form an image that is not just perfectly focused, but focused on everything in the scene simultaneously - something that is impossible to do optically.  This is almost never relevant; the quality is too low for professional photographers, but perhaps people who need the macro feature would be able to get everything in the shot fully focused.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Proves the concept, but it's still a beta", "Author": "Shane O.

It would definitely be a poor choice as one's only digital camera. You're not going to be able to take 'normal' shots of portraits, landscapes, etc., with it. But the simple fact is, you can do things with this camera you cannot do with any other.The camera itself (nor the price) hasn't changed in two years, and only now in the Christmas 2013 shopping season have they started to drop the price. The good news is that they are clearly still actively developing the software: the additional of their mobile app / activation of its built-in WiFi, and the addition of the 3D mode both within the past few months, is very encouraging.Also, I can think of absolutely no reason in the world to possibly get the 16gb version. As other people have said, the built-in touch LCD is simply too small to notice the refocusing effect and the Lytro needs to be used in conjunction with a laptop readily available for the desktop software. Since you can do very little without connecting the Camera to a mobile device via Wifi or to a Mac/PC, even 4 gb would be good enough.It's an awesome creative tool, but it's not great with sharp lines, large bland uniform-colored areas, or in normal light. Outdoors, nature closeups, and being creative with the shot with something both for near and farther away is the way to go.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable, magnificent.", "Author": "Anthony J.

The true depth is most noticeable when there's a big contrast (something in the foreground and background) and if the contrast isn't there it looks a lot like a regular old 2D picture.  It's true, if you're looking to just take snapshots, then this probably isn't the camera for you.  But if you're looking to explore your creativity in 3D, or if you are someone who loves having unbelievable technology before your friends, then this is a magnificent device.  Those who review it and find it difficult to use are likely complaining that it takes a long time to move the date from camera to computer and then from computer to online.  Sure, and a sportscar requires more maintenance than a beetle.  The pictures are 3D data, not a single slice of 2D data, so the data files are massive, and there's no way around that which still preserves true 3D.  So it's not for everyone, it's for the enthusiast.  And it takes MAGNIFICENT pictures that are simply impossible with a different device.  But for taking a snapshot, it's not the optimal tool (although a snapshot can be taken and rendered to a much smaller 2D version without difficulty).  For snapshots, it's like using a Ferrari to run your errands and drop off six kids at school.  Amazing technology that unleashes new boundaries on what can be done with photography.

The most important is the composition of objects - one of them has to be really close to the camera. Actually, one of my pictures (grapes and the church in the backround) was even rewarded.The camera is really nice, and is relatively easy to handle.The drawbacks are the LCD screen, which is difficult to see in bright light, and also sometimes difficult to operate, the zoom, which may be activated by mistake, and the lens cap, which may be lost easily. Also, this is the first camera of this type. So, it is reasonable to expect some 'child diseases'.However, this is a great gadget!

Get one or get left behind.", "Author": "Aaron C. Logan", "ReviewID": "RNOUG78KRE4J5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Lytro truly breaks the mold of present-day camera design and wisely allows its form to be dictated by function. What you get is a comfortable-in-the-hand, lightweight, squared tube that takes radically different photos. Refocus-after-the-snap isn't just hype -- it's the real deal -- and it will change the way you think about photography. Whenever I look at a 2D photos now, I want to be able to click and refocus! (And as light field photos become more commonplace, the absence of refocusability in 'standard photos' will become even more maddening, I'm sure.)The results you can get out of this little, reasonably inexpensive (as far as camera equipment goes) light field camera are downright amazing some times. Its only weakness that I've noticed so far is that shots tend to be a little bit grainy in very low light, but so too are those from every other camera in this price range, so I'm willing to live with that.For everyday use, the Lytro is simply fun and easy to use (instant on, no focusing time, etc.) and the photos provide opportunities for interactivity and discovery after your take the shot. In the short time I've had my Lytro, I've already taken many photos that I love to go back to and interact with through refocusing the light field. It's brilliant.I've had my Lytro for a few months and while I'm still learning to use it to its maximum potential, Lytro has just given me even more room to learn and be creative by releasing a firmware upgrade to enable more control over exposure settings. The steady release of firmware upgrades is a welcome sign that Lytro (the company) cares deeply about enabling consumers to get the most out of Lytro (the camera).Although I tend to be an early adopter, I can recommend a Lytro camera to anyone who enjoys taking and looking at photos without hesitation. I also think light field photography will have many industry-specific applications, so it's worthwhile to start working with this novel technology now -- for instance, I'm a physician and I see potential applications for light field photography in medical care for anatomic lesion documentation and other things.So, in summary, definitely lots of things worth exploring with the fun and very capable first-gen Lytro camera, and it will be very interesting to see how others explore their creativity with this and future Lytro devices.Like I said in the title, Lytro is the future of photography.

Shame on Lytro for releasing  a junior-version camera that lacks features that will provide for good images (no flash). While it's possible to argue that images modification is a software issue through Lytro's software, there is not a lot of ways to manage their images. An Adobe pulg-in should have been considered in the premarketing of this device, along with other ways to manage the images. When I bought my camera, there was not a Windows version of their image management software.As someone who works in high-end digital SLR formats, this camera is underpowered, lacks credible optics or a processor that permits digital photography as it is practiced today. After a few test shots, I was disappointed with the camera and sent it back to Lytro. My Lytro lasted less than a day, before it was returned.Lytro certaily has an opportunity to get out of the toy camera business and develop a credible photographic system of camera and software versus the pathetic release of its current device.
