I got the panasonic 14-140 HD OIS lenz with the camera. Pictures are mediocre with this lenz. Camera and lenz not much lighter than my old DSLR and picture quality is somewhere between a dlsr and a cybershot cam. I got this to replace the DLSR that i lost! during an oversee trip. Bought this from Pancam thru amazon and although it said brand new the first one was leaving green haze on the picts. I contacted Pancam and they replaced the camera and the lenz pretty quickly. Service was great but never felt that the items were actually brand new!", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best DSLR in all terms  I Love it", "Author": "Umardilse", "ReviewID": "R2FSBVUMF3SI0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply the best.
