{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very cheap merchandise!!  Not what is pictured!", "Author": "Randall Flaherty", "ReviewID": "R1U0A0H9009FQ8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all the \"tri pod\" is very small and cheap!  I would never put a $1,000.00 camera on it.  The rest of the stuff is very cheaply made and off brand, looks like it came from the Harbour Freight store of camera gear.  The small tri pod is even worse, maybe big enough fro a toy camera!  For what purpose does it serve??? The \"case\", rediculous.  Too small to carry hardly anything and does not match what is shown.  I also did not get a 16 GB memory card but they were nice enough to send me two 8 GB cards.  THANKS SO MUCH!! Everything came in a package the size of a show box to give you a clue. RETURNING IT ALL!!!", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "All items are good", "Author": "Siva Gopal Varma", "ReviewID": "R16RQNTHZ66V23", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Digital Video Flash was not received and all the rest are Good and Delivery's Fast, Hope the flash was also sent", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005IGZHJ0"}}
