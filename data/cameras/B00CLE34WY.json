After 8 days I noticed that price dropped nearly a $100. I went to my orders and clicked \"return item\" and mentioned the reason. I immediately got an email saying Return request closed and the reason being \"Refund without return\".  Next day I got Refund on order for $120. I had researched DavisMAX before buying and based on the reviews, I purchased this because of positive reviews and also it was the best deal i could find. Completely satisfied with the professional handling of the customer query.Now, as far as the product is concerned, The instant i opened the box, i found all the canon products in their original packing. Unboxed them and immediately registered the product on canon website with the serial numbers (body and both the lens). Overall satisfied with the cannon stuff I got. As far as the other bundled items go, the bag is of a good quality, I liked the compactness of the big tripod, i never had a chance to test out the effectiveness of the 3 filters or the 2 extra lens attachments(wide angle and 2x). The additional battery with car charger was a plus.Regarding the cons, I would have preferred an USM lens for the 75-300mm. It is hardly $40 more and i would have definitely paid that extra $$$. The bundled 75-300mm is not USM but i bought it anyway because if i buy them separately the cost was going to be around $1000.Another thing this bundle is missing is the 40mm pancake lens, it about $135  but worth the price addition because it would really compliment the worlds smallest SLR body with the smallest lens and u would literally have point and shoot camera size which gives an amazing quality. I am buying the \"Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM Lens\", will check if DavisMAX has it or else will order from some other vendor or amazon.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon SL1", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R7C78VXP00JRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is my first DSLR and it exceeds my expectations.I had avoided buying a DSLR  in the past because I was afraid of the weight.

I took some pictures at night, I love them. It is my first DSLR, I am not an expert in photography but wanted to take some good pictures for family memories. The auto focus and image stabilization options were very helpful in taking those shots for a fast moving roller coaster where I had to move along from one side to another and take quick shots. Didn't have to worry about focusing. Light weight, but when the lens is added, it is a little heavier. Normal I guess since it is not a point and shoot camera", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Enter a new world", "Author": "palaeologus \"nipponophile\"", "ReviewID": "R3P52NDZ82JHMA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A great choice for first-time DSLR users -- start with program modes and work into using manual settings as the art of photography takes hold.

The camera functions wonderfully. I am not having any issues with the lens that come with it. I love  the quality of the pictures this camera takes. I have smaller hands, so I also like the size of the camera as well. I like how it has a built in flash and also a mount for a larger flash.I like that it comes with the three filters for the lens. I just got to learn how to use them.I like that is comes with an extra memory card because I filled my extra for my point and shoot camera right away.What I didn't like was that the tripod is of very cheap quality, both the mini and the large, so I will not use it for this application, I'll just use it for my video camera. I would recommend that you do not rely on the large tripod for your camera. And the mini one, don't even bother using it. the camera with the lens is too heavy for it, so it's pointless.I don't care for the quality of the extra battery. The life of it is half to the life of the Canon battery. It is good for a spare while you are waiting for the Canon battery to charge again. But I would do your research on getting a better quality after you get the camera for spare if you do a lot of picture taking.The bag, well, lets just say it's good for just getting by until you get one that has more storage compartments and dividers. I will use this bag for my video camera once I find I more suitable bag for my growing collection on camera equipment", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "lanie decamara", "ReviewID": "R39TFP7V69GIE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i went to SAMS and found this camera for 799 with only the two lens and a case!! so i was really happy when i found this but wasn't to sure!!! well i am absently happy with this package deal!! everything i needed in it!!", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lightweight, excellent camera, great price!", "Author": "Todd A.
