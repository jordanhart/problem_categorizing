Pretty easy to use and good build quality.  Definitely use NiMH batteries -- but in any case I prefer these to LiIon because the latter are [spendier] and lose capacity after ~300 cycles.  NiMH can be charged 1000 times before they degrade!

I am very pleased with the crisp clear pics I'm able to take with this camera and just love the ease of use.  I feel the only drawback  is how fast you can go thru batteries, so I highly recomment using rechargeable (NiMH) batteries and keeping a few sets charged and ready to go.  This camera is just plain fun to use and that makes it outstanding!", "Date": "July 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "A BEST BUY", "Author": "E. E Pofahl", "ReviewID": "R3069SOWWVTM4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For persons unfamiliar with digital photography who do not wish to be limited to a \"point-and-shoot\" camera as they learn the digital process, the Toshiba PDR-4300 is an excellent choice. The camera combines Toshiba's superior digital imaging expertise with a high imaging sensor into a camera that is easy to use. After the beginner has mastered \"point-and-shoot\" techniques, the PDR-4300 with a 4-megapixel resolution and a full set of professional-level manual options, they can readily progress to more advanced digital photography. The camera has a built-in flash and an all-glass quality Canon lens with a 2.8x optical zoom and with digital zoom provides 6x total zoom. The camera has several other features all of which makes for brilliant resolution and excellent photos. Finally, the installation software is \"user-friendly\" and excellent.The camera battery life is poor. Battery life can be improved by adhering to the camera manual's instructions to turn off the LCD screen and use the viewfinder when taking pictures. However, the buyer should purchase a battery charger and buy rechargeable batteries that have a much longer life. Also, the 16 MB SD memory card limits the camera's picture file capacity and should be replaced by a 32 or 64 MB memory card. Nevertheless, the 16 MB card is adequate during the beginner stage in digital photography.My major criticism concerns the camera manual. The manual is readable, comprehensive and well organized. Unfortunately, the manual, in four languages, is very poorly bound. I had not finished reading the introductory sections before the pages in the English section became unbound. Either the binding should be improved or each language section should be separately bound.The camera is a \"best buy\", and is lots of fun to use.", "Date": "February 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Best set of features and qualilty for the price", "Author": "Phaedrus \"Phaedrus\"", "ReviewID": "R224ZP1XGR8JJF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had always used a manual 35mm camera, and wanted to get into digital but did not want my first digital camera to be a really expensive one (since I am learning the digital side and have not yet built enough knowledge to know exactly what I will need in my final, expensive camera yet).  I chose this camera based on its price, megapixel count, and ability to switch to a full manual mode.  After getting three sets of NiMH batteries and a charger, I have been well satisfied.  With an ISO equiv of 100, 200, or 400 and a shutter speed of 1/1000 down to 1/2 and then extended as far as 30 secs with an internal processing stage, I was able to take a still life shot in almost total darkness by setting the camera on a tripod and using f2.9, 30sec exposure.  It does love daylight.  The digital zoom comes out a bit grainy in low light situations, but with daylight you can zoom all the way out optical and digital and still get good crisp images.  I found the flash to be a bit underpowered, which means that closeups are too harshly lit and distant shots dont get enough light.  But there are tricks I have learned to use to get super quality flash pics:  Back up from the subject and then zoom in a bit rather than zooming out and being physically close to the subject (at too close range, you get harsh flash with uneven flashlense lines on the subject).  Also, holding a small piece of tissue over the flash will make really nice pictures because it softens and diffuses the light -- no more shiny spots on foreheads.  I really like the ability to choose standard or vibrant color, and the choice of color, b&w;, or sepia.  The timer works well for eliminating shaky hands even on handheld shots because you are not pushing the shutter manually and can concentrate on a still handhold.  The only manual feature it doesn't really do completely is focus.  There are settings for 1m and 3m and infinity.  The closeup macro and the AF are both autofocus and will need a bit of good lighting in order to lock on.  I sometimes shine a bright light at the subject while going to the half-pressed shutter and then turn off the light to actually snap the picture (only works if setting exposure manually - otherwise the extra light will cause the autoexposure to choose the wrong settings).  So if you want to experiment and have fun with digital photography and dont want to pay a lot, this is an excellent choice.  If you are not that interested in the photography of it, and only want the \"soccer mom's point-and-shoot weekender for occasional birthday parties etc\" then there are other cameras that are faster to start up, have bigger flash units, and use less battery power.  But then they dont have all the settings that this one has for really creative photography on a budget.", "Date": "February 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "too cumbersome", "Author": "S \"amazon16611\"", "ReviewID": "R2SY8L2PBRWKOT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While the picture quality is good (too red actually, but can be fixed with software), there are too many drawbacks to rate it above 3 stars. The battery drain is very high when in photo mode, so using high-drain regular or rechargeable batteries is essential, as regular ones die after only a couple of shots. The built-in flash isn't bright enough, so I'd only recommend it for outdoor use. Manual locking of the battery compartment where SD card is located is a hassle, as is the manual lens cover. Basically, it takes about a minute to get it ready to shoot, OK for prepared shots, but too slow if you need to catch something quickly. Does not come with a charger and rechargeable set of batteries. Also too bulky, especially since you need to carry 4 extra AA batteries, just in case. No webcam, movie mode is OK, but no sound, unlike other 4Mpixel cameras. In this case, definitely, you get what you pay for, maybe even a bit less.", "Date": "May 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Serves its purpose well enough but I could have done better", "Author": "C. M.

It lasted through college and I continue to use it to this day!  I don't know how many times I've dropped it, yet it's continued to work just fine - even after quite a few hits to the lens housing!  Just got some crystal clear pictures of the aftereffects of the ice storm yesterday.  I continue to be amazed at the quality of some of the pictures I get.  The only drawback I notice besides battery life is lots of noise and shadow in low lighting - but this camera makes up for that by how well it performs in ample sunlight.  Also, if you're an avid movie-taker this camera may disappoint - frames didn't come out too clearly and it does not have audio capabilities.  But I've used the video feature perhaps twice in nearly four years, so it didn't bother me.  I would definitely purchase from this Toshiba line again - with a Canon lens, knowledge that I can depend on this camera to hold up for years and the fact that this was my first \"real\" digital camera, I'm too taken to want anything else for a loooong time :)", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Toshiba PDR4300 4MP Digital Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3VYGMRW2XUA58", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I find the camera takes great photographs and easy to use.
