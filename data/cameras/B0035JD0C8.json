Fox \"Jolando\"", "ReviewID": "R22DAINXGRJFMM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a camera that does it all, this might not be the camera for you. If you're looking for a low budget, beginner or second camera with features and zoom in a compact size, I would definitely recommend this one, as long as you know its limitations.To the positive. This is definitely a pocket compact: small, weighing just 5.5 oz, it slips easily into purse or pocket. It's also a fast P&S.; The focusing is extremely fast and the shutter response is quite acceptable. The printed results without editing and taken outdoors in sunlight are sharp when printed in 8.5x11 size, although the colors seem pushed a bit rather than natural. However, I didn't find that to be unpleasing and the photo can always be toned down in a photo editing program.Another plus  is the camera shoots HD video, but a computer program like Picasa, which will show the video, shows it in very poor quality and resolution.This camera is very much a P&S.; If you're looking for simplicity, it fits the bill. The anti-shake feature is negligent. The printed instruction manual tells you to hold the camera steady with your elbows pressed to your sides to take the picture. Not an encouragement for macro or low light, hand held photography. However, the zoom does go out to a full 10x optical with good results in bright sun. I haven't tried it on a rainy or overcast day yet, but did try shooting in the direction of the sun with good results and no noticeable purple fringing.Indoors with flash is acceptable. The flash distance is 1.6 feet. Any closer than that, the flash does go off, but it gets the shadow of the lens in the lower right corner.Most of the features such as sunset, beach, snow, etc. are built into the F1 setting on the top wheel and through the menu system. The camera has face detection and flesh colors come out fairly well.I've only had the camera a day. I bought it as a second camera because I wanted a 10x or better zoom in a pocket camera I could take along everywhere, including bicycle rides. For $200, this fit in my plans. I have other cameras I can use for macros and hand held night shots.

The neat thing with this camera is the dial has sp1 and sp2 you can program from 13 different programs. I had good luck using the nighttime mode indoors in lower light and the colors and contrast seem more accurate. The dial has a scene recognition auto mode and a auto mode, again using it indoors seemed pretty inconsistent in lower light. I don't consider this camera a beginner camera just because of the program functions. The zoom is amazing, like most cameras at high magnification must be held still to get a sharp picture. Don't know if it has a stablization program, seems like it doesn't. The dial has 8 functions; natural flash, natural, scene recognition auto, auto, program, sp1, sp2, video. It doesn't have a AV mode for the more advanced user. Although iso can be set all the way down to 3200. This camera was a replacement for my Fuji F30 and it surpasses it everyway. The F30 was friendlier to use indoor. Blew some of the pictures up I took at full zoom and was amazed how they stayed sharp. Video I haven't used much, its sharp, also the zoom can be used in video. If your having problems in the auto mode try one of the program modes and I'm sure you'll find something to work. This pocket camera has alot of features for someone who likes to have the ability to adjust for the conditions the camera is being used. One more thing helps the focus from hunting is I'll push the shutter button half way on the image I want in focus on then frame the picture and it holds it pretty good, even if I release the button. So if your looking for a simple point and shoot this isn't it. Pick the right program and it will blow away the other point and shoots.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "updated 9-20-10 so-so videos, but indoor photos not good at all", "Author": "violinmom", "ReviewID": "R3CNOANBAVB3UP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not pleased at all with this camera. I bought it to replace an older Fuji camera. That one took great photos, inside and out, but it only took 1 minute long videos. So I decided to get another Fuji camera and this new one takes much longer videos. I assumed the photo quality would be the same, if not better, than the older Fuji camera I own. I was SO WRONG.No matter what setting I use I get grainy indoor photos. At times, if I'm sitting close to the object, I will get a good photo. But typically the photos come out grainy. I even use the setting where it takes two photos back to back, one with flash, the other without, and still both photos will be grainy.I am not happy AT ALL with this camera. Yes, I get longer videos, but I have to carry both cameras with me when I visit the grandkids. The old Fuji camera to take still shots. And this new Fuji camera to take videos. Kind of a hassle, taking both cameras, but I can't get good still shots with this new Fuji camera.UPDATE 9-20-2010Ended up replacing this camera with a Canon (PowerShot SD1400IS, which I love so far). At first I had decided to keep the Fuji JZ300 to take videos, since it seemed to do a decent job. But the Fuji has this sound sensor which turns off the recording of sound if the camera doesn't pick up any noise. This turned out to be a real problem! It would not start recording sound quick enough, so you missed the first two or three words a person said! There would be complete silence during playback, and then you'd see the person in the video start to talk, and then the camera would start back up recording the sound. Very frustrating! Also, I got tired of hearing the camera itself zooming in and out during the taking of videos. In the middle of filming something you'd go to zoom in during a critical moment, and you'd hear \"zzzzzzzzzzip\" Zoom back out and again you'd hear \"zzzzzzzzip\". You would hear this while filming AND during playback, so of course you'd miss any of the conversation or sound you were wanting to record. My new Canon has a digital zoom that is silent, both while filming and during playback. I can't believe I lived with this Fuji JZ300 so long, now that I know something much better is out there. My husband gave me this Canon camera this past weekend for my birthday (probably because he got tired of me complaining about this Fuji JZ300 so much!). :-)", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title":

The photo quality was a huge disappointment.  Outdoor photos were average.  Indoor pictures were terrible..grainy, mottled, dull color and not crisp.

If you are looking for a camera that will take easy, quick snapshots on an auto setting that produces clear, crisp shots...this is NOT it!  Also, the dial that you select the mode with turns very easily, and would not stay on the mode I set it on.  The face recognition feature was not very effective...if the subjects have on glasses or a hat, or have long hair, it often will not work.

Roman", "ReviewID": "R13DFFCVG83HSD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My Samsung L100 died last week, and despite being over a year old and \"just\" 8.2 MP, it was a great camera. I got this Fujifilm JZ300 as a replacement, and I can't believe how much worse it is in every department aside from size, compared to the Samsung. I'm no professional photographer, or even a photography student by any means, but I have an eye for detail, and there's no way you can convince me that this is a real 12 MP camera with HD video capabilities.I've went through all the settings on this thing after taking a few pictures to make sure it was set to 12 MP, and sure enough, it was. Then I set the quality from normal to fine, and it honestly didn't make a difference. If anything, it made the file size bigger and that's it. So what's so bad about the image quality? I'll put a picture up in the customer images for you to see. Everything is grainy. At first I thought that it might just be that the images look better when you view them in a larger size, but they looked worse. Even my old Canon Powershot from 2005, a 4 MP camera, put out better quality images than this. As for the video quality, that's grainy too. I will say one positive thing about it though- the audio for video on this camera -is- better than the Samsung's. Everything is nice and clear and loud with this JZ300. But really, is audio as important as video when going over features on a camera that's supposed to be HD?Don't even get me started on the other features of the camera, like face detection, the smoothing option and even my beloved Macro, which I'll admit- I use for damn-near everything. If I had to say anything else nice, and I'm really grasping here, it's that you really can just point and shoot without waiting a second or two for the image to stabilize. That and the audio for video are the only pros aside from the size/weight.What else can I say? I'm severely disappointed by this thing and will be exchanging it for a different model.

When I'm done, I just put the memory card in my Mac and store, E-mail them, post to Facebook, etc.  I found the battery life to be more than sufficient (though I bought a spare).One thing that I LOVE is that it automatically takes out the red eye.  With my Canon and my Kodak I had to depress the shutter until it beeped, so if I asked someone to take a photo of me and my wife they often did not understand this extra step and voila--lots of photos with red eye.

After narrowing the field to several Canon models and a Panasonic, I chose the Fuji because of positive experience with the brand, its metal body,  and mostly because of the 10x zoom. In this price range and category, the best I could find was 5x and to get the 10x feature I was willing to compromise on other features.The Fuji is a small camera, perfect for pocket, purse, or glove compartment. Finding a small generic case for this camera model is easy; we got one made by Kodak that fits better than OJ's glove.In the automatic mode the camera identifies the scene leaving the user only to decide between flash or no flash. I like the P mode which allows the user to set white balance, picture quality, and shutter speed.The scene modes are not extensive, but most of the typical modes like snow, sport, landscape,  beach, fireworks, night, flower, portrait, etc are listed in the menu. I like that on the dial are two SP settings for which the user can preset two frequently used scene modes.Picture quality for this little camera is pretty good. I own three other cameras, all costing at least twice as much as this one;  overall sharpness is better on pictures taken with the bigger cameras  but not overwhelmingly so. The pictures taken with the Fuji and enhanced with a photo program are more than acceptable. Most of the colors on the Fuji pictures are quite vivid; this can be modified on the computer, but I prefer the intense, saturated colors for most applications.Final thoughts:Image stabilization works well.Like the 10x zoom a lotTo get out of the menu settings just lightly depress the shutter buttonFace recognition works wellSmall recessed on/off button can be tricky for big fingers.Comfortable in the handSmall dial is not the easiest to turnThe Fuji JZ300 is worth considering.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst camera I ever had", "Author": "mamabear", "ReviewID": "R28T80FKRKZL1W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this camera after careful  research but we are so disappointed.

After about a month it developed a dead pixel on the viewscreen. Within three months half the screen had gone black making it difficult to see exactly what the picture looks like. After about a year the rubber came off the lens. I'm not sure precisely how long it will continue to function after this (perhaps the damage is mostly cosmetic) but I feel like the camera is on its last legs. I'll use it 'till it goes for good, but it really shouldn't be falling apart yet. I took good care of it and kept it in a nice case secure from physical damage. Certainly I used it a lot but not enough for this, and the screen damage started before I had really gotten the chance to do more than just try it out. Perhaps I simply got a defective one, but that just means that if you get this be sure to watch carefully for any problems before the warranty expires. One dead pixel isn't a problem, but a few hundred is.As for the camera itself, it's decent enough. I really liked it until it started to fall apart. Even then I was able to take my pictures no problem. As some people have noticed it doesn't take very good low-light pictures. They tend to come out very grainy. Nonetheless when I learned how to use it I took some quite exceptional nighttime shots of illuminated buildings at night. I even managed to use the zoom while propping myself against a wall (ie: no tripod) and the pictures came out perfect. I think that a lot of the negative criticisms of the camera overstate the case. While the low-light shots were grainy, they were rarely terrible. If mediocre indoor functionality of a camera is a dealbreaker then this may be a camera to avoid, but otherwise it isn't a major problem. I took most of my photos during the day in any event, and they came out beautiful. No grain at all and very crisp.The battery life is alright. I wish that cameras like this could just take AA batteries when your main one dies, but I guess that that isn't gonna happen. I ended up buying a spare battery and even being an atrocious shutterbug the two batteries lasted me all day. I'm not that familiar with digital cameras (my last camera was a 30mm SLR) so I can't say whether that's good or not. All that I know is that it was adequate for my needs. The only time I had a problem was when I accidentally left my charger at home while I was in the middle of the Jordanian desert. I actually had more of a problem with the SDHC Cards. The 4 GB one that the camera comes with just doesn't cut it. You are going to need to buy a bigger one at some point.You can actually do a surprising amount with this camera for just a simple point-and-shoot. The zoom is amazing for its size. I don't think that any of the models of comparable price can compete with a 10x zoom. The various settings take a little while to figure out, but once you get them sorted you can take very good pics. Obviously this can't compete with a more advanced camera, but then few of those can fit in your pocket and none of them are cheap. All in all this isn't a bad camera for basic shots, provided that you get one that isn't defective.
