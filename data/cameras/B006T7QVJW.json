{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Little Point & Shoot Camera", "Author": "Eva Pauline Scott \"Eva P. Scott\"", "ReviewID": "R1YRYEUDAOSIUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband chose this camera for me after doing extensive research. He chose it for the price and ease of function.I wanted a camera that was intuitive to use and didn't take looking in the manual to take a simple photo. I love taking photos, but I don't want to become a professional photographer.This camera takes beautiful detailed photos and is easy to use.It has a button near the top of the camera to move the lens closer for long-range photos.You can turn off the flash and still take fairly decent indoor photos in places you can't use a flash.You can switch between viewing the photos you have taken to taking photos with a separate button on the camera.It has an energy saving mechanism, though, that you will need to understand. If you are waiting for a perfect picture, the camera will turn off to save energy. So, you will either need to increase the time setting or move the focus in and out so the camera will not shut off.This camera has many other features within its menu; but if you don't want to deal with all of those and just want to take photos, this camera is the one to buy.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera.

Great photo quality and I am very happy with it.  Packaging was awesome and it arrived sooner that I thought.  Eventhough the camera doesnt have an internal memory, it is not a big deal because SD cards are everywhere.  Just pop it out and load to your computer for whatever.  I am very happy with this camera and the online deal is greater than the ususal store like Bestbuy.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Phillip", "ReviewID": "R7OSOG0WQA2VP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first thing that caught my attention was the small size and weight of this camera. of course having 16 megapizels and 10x optical zoom are a few of the main reason I purchased the camera. There are a lot of things you can do with this camera, just look through the menus and start shooting. My first photos of some flowers (still life) came out amazing.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great until it breaks!", "Author": "lynfrommaine", "ReviewID": "R3NZX0ZUX9U8U2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved this camera.  It takes great close up shots for selling items online.  Then, 8 months after purchase, the message \"Turn off the camera and turn it on again\" appeared.  Rebooting it did nothing to help.  Fuji will fix it free.  Here is the problem:  They will have my camera for 4 - 6 weeks in order to fix it or send me a new one.  If you use it for work or anything important, don't buy this camera unless you can return it somewhere locally and get something that works ASAP.  Really, a month plus?Edited after replacement came in the mail:  Well, I got a refurbished or new T400 camera in the mail in a week, not the 4-6 weeks I was quoted.  I guess I will sell the Panasonic I picked up.Edited after using another camera: The T400 takes great shots and is easy to use. I guess if it is going to break occasionally, I should just rotate 2 of them.  I missed it dearly.  It takes great pics for selling on line.Grrrrr! Editing again! 2 refurbished replacements are defective. I am sending a 3rd T400 back under warranty.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Photo Quality", "Author": "Mark R. Rouleau", "ReviewID": "R1VMW1A3SJGCEV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very disappointed in this camera.  I'm no camera expert, I wanted something good but compact to take with me everywhere to capture all those spontaneous moments with my daughter.  Quality of pictures is fair with ideal conditions and the pre-programmed settings don't seem to help much.  For instance, even with minimal movement and on \"Sport\" mode, I haven't been able to take a single non-blurry picture.  Focus time is relatively extensive and I've missed many great shots waiting for it to focus.  Low-light shots are just about not worth bothering to take.  Perhaps I just go a lemon, but if my experience is representative of this camera, I would not recommend this camera to anyone no matter the price point, find something that will at least take reliable, everyday pictures.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Wayne O. Norvell", "ReviewID": "R935Y06OM3S6C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Impressed with quality of pictures and user friendly.However, I don't think it is a \"true\" 10x zoom as advertised unless there's a technical feature that I don't understand...I have an older Nikon that is a 5x zoom and takes closer shots than the Fugi.  Overall performance is excellent nonetheless.

BUT, it didn't come with a memory card, so now I have to wait til I get to town to pick one up.

I just ordered new battery extra for back up.. also the higher and best settings the less battery life  and lets not talk about hd video even shorter time also zoom and viewing pics drain battery real fast.. when photo taking I set mine manually for scene or regular auto the SR auto setting sucks because when sometimes recognizing a scene it picks the wrong one and you'll end up with blurry pics..", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Keetnik38", "ReviewID": "RQQKIBH8MP42V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera does so much, im still finding stuff!

Dogs and children move very quickly and I found with my old camera there was invariably movement after I clicked the shutter and before the camera actually took the picture.  It is a learned skill, I guess, but I do find that the pictures I've gotten with this camera come out pretty nicely.  It is not the smallest camera, but there is a 10x zoom on it.  It has lots of nice features, and it is pretty easy to learn how to use this camera.  I've gotten lots of nice shots with this little gem.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought Two; Both Were Defective", "Author": "A. F. Pacela \"PapaAlan\"", "ReviewID": "R35ZWXZRAEPDIW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received one free on a Mattress sale promotion at Macy's.  It had a permanent dull spot in the sensor which produced a spot in every photo (yes, the lens was clean).  But, I loved the camera, so I bought a replacement from Amazon.  This second one had a defective flash.  It worked a couple of times, then quit.  I tried resetting to factory settings, various program modes, recharged the battery, inserted a new battery, and tried forced flash but still no flash.  Now, my problem is this: I love the size, 10X zoom, 16 Megapixels, and weight of the camera. The photos were fine; no issues. So should I buy another one or not?  I am thinking to look for a newer model, if it exists.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money", "Author": "Brandi Simon", "ReviewID": "RLBBBT98DECR9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was looking for a decent quality camera to replace my DSLR while I'm saving for a replacement lens for it. Boy I should have played around with this thing more before it got too late to take it back. Picture quality is very poor (I have to take 4 shots just to get one good one). I will admit that I'm used to my DSLR auto focus which is almost instantaneous and being able to take photos in rapid succession but this thing is just horrible. The auto focus takes forever and it's horrible with movement. I needed something that was good to use to take pictures of the kids, who are in constant motion, this is NOT the camera.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst Camera, Dont buy this one", "Author": "KB", "ReviewID": "RQRTYQZ5RD6WB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was looking to get a small digital camera to take pictures of my deployment to send back to the wife and this camera seemed to fit the bill. Well I was in for a big surprise. The first camera worked for about a day before it would no longer power up or charge. Ok, back to the store. They thought it was a battery issue and tried a known good battery, but that did not fix the problem. So they exchanged the camera for a new one, round two. This one worked for a while but now displays a warning message telling me to power down and back on again. I am unable to clear the message and since my deployment was so long the store I bought this at wont take it back. Thanks Fuji for ripping me off.
