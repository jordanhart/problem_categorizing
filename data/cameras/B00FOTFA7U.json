I strongly disagree with the way Nikon \"handled\" the D600 problem, but people should know that the D610 is truly a fantastic camera.  I was motivated to write this review after I saw numerous people writing poor reviews of the D610 based on their disapproval of Nikon's actions.I don't think it's fair to criticize the D610 based on the shortcomings of its predecessor, so I wanted to take the time to say that all of the problems I had with the D600 seem to have been solved with this camera.  My D610 produces absolutely fantastic images and there hasn't been a hint of the dust or oil problems that plagued the D600.For detailed analysis of this camera and its image quality, check out DXOmark.com; they do a much better job of objectively reviewing cameras than I can.  But in my opinion the D610 is an excellent camera.  I highly recommend it.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice upgrade from D90", "Author": "Ran Xerox", "ReviewID": "R2E74V2VRJGHBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you own a D600, and have an issue with spots on your images, search the internet for \"Technical Service Advisory for Nikon D600\".  Nikon is replacing all of the defective shutters.I have had the D610 since Oct 22 and I am very impressed with everything about this camera.  This is my first FX format camera and I love it.  A friend of mine has the the D600 and he has never had an issue with oil on the sensor so I was never worried about it with the D610.  I purchased through Amazon and the packing was awesome, just make sure someone is home to sign for it : ) .  I own the Sigma 35mm F1.4 DG, Nikon 50mm f/1.8D, the Nikon 85mm f/1.8G, and the Tamron AF 70-200mm f/2.8.  Nikon SB-600 flash works with it fine.  It does have a DX crop mode that you can use on a non DX lens, might help with the the long end of a zoom for sports to make a 200mm equal to a 300mm.  Nice big viewfinder image helps me with focus issues I had on the D90.  I loved the D90 but the D610 is on a different level.  I use this for high school and college sports, orchestra and band.  The quiet shutter mode has helped with the indoor events.After using it this weekend, I have noticed that there is a big improvement with low light focus on the Tamron AF 70-200mm f/2.8/D610 over the D90. It did not \"hunt\" like with the D90, I think because it could find contrast easier. I tried shooting in the shadows, even though it found contrast in very low light it was not always in focus but did not hunt all over - and it was a usable shot instead of no shot. It correctly did not auto select DX with the Tamron. With the D610 the \"70\" end of the 70-200 is now much more usable. Essentially with the D90 I was carrying a 105-300 lens. Now I don't need to bring a second lens if I can stand 5 or 6 feet back to get waist to head coverage shots. I did not notice color or corner issues in the shots I got, I was expecting to see problems.Shooting an indoor swim meet I noticed the corners where very sharp with no perception of light fall off. There was no focus hunting at all, and I took over 100 shots. Because of the higher resolution of the D610, I was able to crop to get a lot closer to the subject. For sports this combo is awesome, use the 3D mode for auto focus.The Sigma 35mm F1.4 DG is amazing.  I will probably use this lens most of the time.  The only lens I will need to take along with is the Nikon 85mm f/1.8G . Between the two lens and switching to \"DX\" mode, I will have essentially 35, 50(dx crop), 85 and 127(dx crop) in primes with me.I hope this helps someone switching from DX to FX.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Come on over, the shutter is fine.", "Author": "R.

Evans\"", "ReviewID": "R2UMCI1O3KO05D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't usually write product reviews, but I feel like there are a lot of people who may need a little encouragement before deciding to purchase this camera. Reading through this product page can certainly drive one crazy trying to filter through actual reviews and the bitter remarks about D600s and sensor debris. I owned a D600 and it did have problems with oil spots on the sensor. I understand that not all D600s have this problem, but mine did, even after it was refurbished by Nikon. For those of you who have a D600 with no problems, you lucked out and have no reason to upgrade to the D610. For those who DID have problems with a D600 and are feeling apprehensive, come on over to the D610. I'm happy with mine. And finally, for those who have not owned either camera and are wondering if it is a camera worthy of purchase, maybe you're considering going from DX to FX, I highly recommend it. I also own a D7000, which I love, but I wanted to make the jump to an FX body. The D600 was the natural choice for me with its \"affordable\" price and overall fantastic performance. Oil issues aside, I really liked the D600. And since the D610 is virtually identical in specifications I know it will perform amazingly.I do a lot of long exposure photographs of stars out in the desert. The low-light capabilities of this camera have been nothing short of impressive. The amount of noise in the images at higher ISOs (1600 and 3200) has been dramatically reduced from the shots I was taking with the D7000. My other focus is wildlife photography, for which I will still primarily use my D7000, but the D610's 6fps burst rate is a really nice feature in case some Bar-Tailed Godwit(rare bird) flies by while I'm taking some seascape shots.The Nikon D610 is a great camera that I highly recommend. I hope this information is helpful.Happy shooting!", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great FX camera - No oil problem (I owned also the D600)", "Author": "Andrea", "ReviewID": "R1BICZI0SN0212", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the D610 since December 14 2013, and I wanted to wait for some time and after a few thousands pictures  before I'd write the review.I owned 2 D600s that I loved for the image quality and its features but they had the dust/oil problem - I managed to sell them and I bought the D610, that I can confirm does not have the oil issue. The D610 behaves as the D600 that I consider a great camera and one of the best on the market.For the people that are complaining in this thread about the D600 and Nikon customer service, I must also say that my experience with the Nikon NY service center has been more than satisfactory - they have been very professional and helpful when I sent the D600s for the shutter replacement; After the shutter replacement, the D600s did not present oil on the sensor.With the D610 I decided to do the following test to make sure that if there was dust on the sensor it was not generated by the camera.The camera arrived with a clean sensor, so I mounted a prime lens (50 mm F/1.8) and I made about 500 shots without changing the lens; then I checked again taking a white picture at f22/ISO 100 and the sensor was still clean as the first \"check\" picture.Then I changed the lens and I mounted a zoom lens (28-300mm) and shot a few hundred pictures before I checked the sensor that a this time had a few dust spots  (~10) spots - they had the same pattern of the D600 on the left top corner and also at the bottom right corner of the picture - I continued to shoot other 500 pictures before I checked again and at this time the sensor had about 40 spots also at the right upper corner.At this point I cleaned the sensor using a dry method (not wet, needed if it was oil) and I was able to fully remove all the dust/spots from the sensor.After the cleaning I mounted the prime lens and I shot again about 500 pictures before checking the sensor that was still clean.From my experience, the dust appears to find a way from the zoom to the sensor, even if I'm very careful making sure that the zoom is clean inside - the dust may cluster to the corners because of the whirl generated by the mirror.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Intro FX Camera", "Author": "Seacrash", "ReviewID": "R3TCD1UA8XP4OD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in the process of starting a photography business and had big decisions to make when it came to which brand and model I was going to go with for my 1st SLR.  I like to be different than the masses so I was leaning towards Nikon over Canon.  I was looking at purchasing the D600, but then read about the oil spot problems and decided to hold off.  I couldn't justify buying the D800 for the money, but didn't want to throw my money away on the D600.  With no good options left, I reluctantly decided that Canon was my only good option (although I definitely would have considered Pentax if they were producing an SLR at the time).Just as I was about to make the purchase, I saw that Nikon released the D610.  I was ecstatic--thinking that timing is everything and that this might actually be the one for me.  Positive reviews started flowing in--other than unhappy D600 owners.  I will say that I sympathize with D600 owners because I would be mad as hell too after spending that kind of money.  Needless to say, I don't rush out to buy something the day it hits the market.  Especially, for $2k--I want to read a good sample of reviews first.  Even though it's tough to support a company that left it's customers high and dry, I decided that this D610 was the camera for me and hoped that Nikon had learned it's lesson on the D600 so that a debacle like that doesn't happen again.On to the camera itself.  I've owned it for about 2 months now and have to say I'm very pleased with the purchase.Pros:*** Picture Quality--has been phenomenal.  It's amazing the level of detail 24 MP can provide.  The RAW files are big--so I mostly work with the JPEGs.  Make sure you have a big enough hard drive and fast enough computer to handle these files.  I have the 27\" iMac and it works seamlessly.*** 6 FPS--is plenty fast unless you are shooting extremely fast moving subjects*** Quiet shutter--is definitely quieter than regular shutter, but I wouldn't say it's close to silent*** Dual Memory Card Slots--huge feature--you can use the 2nd slot from backup or solely for video or 1st slot for RAW / 2nd slot for JPEG (what I use)*** Built-in Flash--I will mostly be using an external flash, but it's still a very nice feature to have in case you need it*** U1 and U2 modes--these are customized settings that you can manually program to be able to use with the flip of a switch--certainly a nice feature to save time when shooting events such as weddings, etc.***Low light photography--is exceptional.  Photos end up being much brighter than they are to the naked eye--it's pretty unreal how much light this image sensor can pick up.Cons:*** As others have stated, the 39 point auto focusing system is by no means terrible, but it does \"hunt\" at times--especially in low light.  That's one of the main extras you're paying for in the D800, D4, etc.  I imagine there is much faster reliable focusing on those models.  Still the focus system is good enough for my purposes.I also highly recommend using Lightroom 5 as your photo editor--it's way better than iPhoto and some of the others.  And do yourself a favor--to take full advantage of this camera--invest in good glass.  I have the Nikon 24-70 f/2.8 and 70-200 f/2.8 and both combine with this camera for stunning detail.  If you're investing this much money in a camera, don't go cheap on the glass.  I also recommend buying the battery grip, if for no other reason than the camera feels much better in the hands.  I can get 4 fingers on the body instead of 3 which makes me worry a lot less about my grip slipping.And lastly, I've had no oil spot sensor problems after about 2,000 pictures.  I hope this review is helpful.  I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about this model.  Cheers!UPDATE (03/2014): I've now owned the camera for 4 months and have taken over 4,000 pictures.  There has been no dust/oil spot issues whatsoever.  I continue to be extremely happy with the camera and am always discovering new settings/capabilities.  I purchased the book, \"Mastering the Nikon D610\" by Darrell Young.  It has really helped me understand the full functionality of the camera.  The user's manual is not the easiest/most helpful reading material as you can imagine.  I continue to get compliment after compliment about the quality of the images this camera produces (even from Canon owners of the 5DMIII and 6D).  Once I decided on Nikon, I know I was torn deciding between the d800 and this camera.  I feel confident in saying that this is the best bang for your buck in the current Nikon line.  In fact, I like this camera so much that I've decided to purchase a 2nd one (being a wedding photographer--I need two full frame bodies).", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best proSumer Nikon DSLR to date", "Author": "Robert Cozzi", "ReviewID": "R1CR8XJG0G5WUD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned the D600 and replaced it with this D610.I had the spots on the D600 and was hopeful this model corrected that issue. More on this later.Pros:Improved and noticeably better White Balance over the D600. My in-door \"people\" pictures now look as good as my friends photos who use Canon 5D or 6D DSLRs. This is a great new feature.Good speed for multiple shoots--not Nikon D4s fast, but good enough for everyday things or the occasion soccer match.Scene mode allows you to take great sunset pics when you don't have time to adjust the camera. I don't use the rest of those \"scene\" settings so I can't comment on how good or bad they are, but most cameras have a pretty good set of these I would expect this one to also support them.Full-frame sensor (great depth of field shots using my 50mm lens).Built-in flash is great (my Canon friends are jealous) for most short barrow lenses. Use an external flash for longer lenses.Seeming better LCD color than the D600/D800, but remember that image is not the image recorded, just what is displayed on the camera's LCD so (for example) you could set the LCD to B/W in theory, if you preferred.AE-L/AF-L button can be reprogrammed to AF-ON if you're like me and like to focus and then shoot.Good photo buffer size. I can shoot 12 images in both Raw+JPEG before it starts buffering.  Then get another 3 off in only a second or two. The recording-to-card speed is depended on the SD cards you're using.Cons:Slow Expeed 3 CPU. The Nikon Expeed 4 is out in the new DX format camers, this one could have used it as well. I'm guessing Expeed 4 will be in all new models this year, so if they once again update the D610 to D620 it will probably include Expeed 4 which would help (slow to start up the Menus).Would really like the AF-ON to work in conjunction with the shutter release. Here's what I mean: I would like the camera to use AF-ON when I press AF-ON. When I do not press AF-ON, I would like the shutter to work normally; meaning focus, then shoot. Today I have to toggle between these two modes. Perhaps a dedicated AF-ON button would provide this kind of feature?Recommendations:If you want an FX camera, get a D610 or if you're a megapixel freak, consider the D800/D800e. If you can wait \"5 minutes\" there may be an updated D800 coming out in 2014 that would probably use the Expeed 4 chip; that might be cool.  While there could potentially be a D620 in 2014, I would say if you need a camera buy this one. If you don't then wait a few months and see what happens.Dust Spots: [EDIT: I forgot to include this in the original post] All DSLR cameras have spots on them. It is just that most people moving from the compact \"PowerShot\" or \"CoolPix\" to DSLR FX notice the spots for the first time. The D600 had a shutter or mechanism defect that caused particles of something (some say oil, some say dust, some say grease) to appear in photos at F8 to F22. Most notably on bluesky or snow landscape shots. I too had this issue, a friend of mine also owns a D600 and he did not experience that issue.The D610 has dust on it, already. Do I notice it at less than F8? No. Is it as severe as the D600? No way! In fact it is what I would term \"normal\". Meaning it is the same as you'd expect to see on the D800, D4, Canon 5D, 6D and all the DX format cameras that have a shutter. D610 is probably a bit better and certainly no worse than the \"cleanest\" out there. A few puffs of air with the mirror locked up and the spots are gone.[Update: Dust spots are returning after more and more photos, Nikon support notified me to send it in to someone specific rather than the general support address. \"We've not seen this in this model before.\" said the support supervisor. So I'm sending it in. Fortunately I do not think this is oil or whatever was on the D600, it appears to be only dirty/dust particles probably from metal on metal during shutter release. I'm sure it'll be resolved.]", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Camera is great -- Amazon was not that great", "Author": "Whitedoves", "ReviewID": "R25MCYT7GB70FQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is great, captures a lot of detail, a couple of notches above the D7000 that I had.However, I was quite disappointed by Amazon.  They initially shipped (as I fortunately discovered later) a used camera.  I was a bit suspicious as the camera came with the language, date, and time zone already preset.

I'm a portrait photographer and just a few years in.  I've been shooting with a d90 and have wanted a full frame camera.  I've been eyeing the 800 for six months.  When I saw the 610 was coming out it was less money for the same features I was looking for I got it, but I got so much more than just a full frame camera.  I GOT EVEN SHARPER PICTURES!  My pictures are tack sharp.  Same lens, but my pictures look so much better.  Everything that frustrated me before (fuzzy eyes despite doing everything right with focus, shutter speed and light), has now magically been fixed with the 610. Noise is reduced, low light options are better...The 610 has taken my photographs to a whole new level.  I thought getting another Nikon would be an easy learn, but I did have to re-learn the in's and out's of this camera, but all in all it only took a few days.  Also I was frustrated to find out that my photographs would not load in Lightroom as the camera is so new Lightroom has not come out with version 5.3 to support it.  However that is not Nikon's problem.  After much research I did find out you can download the 5.3 beta version and that pretty much saved me.  I LOVE this camera.  I'm so excited I got it.

Moving on.I've had the D80, D700, and Sony A7 (briefly) before this camera.  I thought I wanted to move away from dSLR's and moved to the A7 for a more compact system with what I thought would be equal performance.  I was entirely wrong.  The A7 focus system is nowhere near as sophisticated as the D610/D700 or even D80 for that matter.  So, I returned the A7 and went back to my good old faithful nikon lenses and the D610 and I'm so happy I did.  Coming from a D700, the image results are just as amazing.  I needed a camera with video, and this thing certainly fills  that role nicely.  There are two things I would change about this camera if I was forced to nitpick.  First is the mode selector dial, it's a pain to use compared to my D700, second is a slightly larger AF focus area (for those rare shots where you need to focus/compose on something towards the edge of the frame.  That's it.  Everything else is perfect.  Battery life, customization, menus, FPS, everything.  Yes it isn't forged out of a rhino skin, but it is still tough/weather sealed.  Unless you are a (clumsy) full time pro who needs a tank of a camera, this should suit you.  I did tons of research and reading on all cameras available at the time I bought my D610.  Let me save you from doing that as well, just buy it.  You'll love it.

Just got my D610 two days ago and started shooting. Picture quality is awesome and second to none. Auto focus is fast and accurate. I am very happy with the autofocus speed of this camera and it makes taking portraits so easy. I was able to shoot up to 5000 ISO with minimal noise. Shot around 800 pics so far and I do not see any issues with sensor spots so far. As it is predicted, they might have fixed the shutter and sensor dust/oil issue.Dual memory card slots is nice and I dont have to carry additional cards with me. I put 32 GB in each of the slots and is more than enough for shooting raw all day long. It is heavy compared to other DX format cameras and heavier than 7100 but feels strong and comfortable to hold using a single hand. I am planning to take advantage of the CLS system and upgrade my strobes to use nikon flashes so that I could use TTL mode all the time. Continuous shooting speed of 6f/s is not much higher than the d600, but I think it would suffice my requirements.Autofocus system is fast. One issue is that most of the 39 points are at the center of the frame. It would have been great if it had more focus points such as D7100. I think the autofocus system used in both cameras is fast but not the same. I own a couple of DX cameras. But I never expected the performance of FX in low light would be this good compared to my previous DX. If you are planning to upgrade to FX and have been thinking for a while, this is the one to get. I am still testing it and have couple of other shoots lined up. I will post more details after this weekend.One issue is that adobe lightroom does not recognize the RAW files out of this camera. We might have to use some exif tool to hack around the camera info in raw files to get them to work in lightroom. Nikon provided their software along with the camera that recognizes the RAW files of D610 but it does not compare to lightroom in functionality. Eagerly waiting for adobe to release their update so that D610 pics could be edited.  I am hoping they will release the update in next few weeks as I have few shoots lined up and do not want to hack around the raw files to process them. Overall its a great camera. I do not see any issues with oil or sensor so far at 800 shots.Update:HSS sync mode on this works great with my SB-700 and I am now able to take pics in broad daylight. Battery life is great. I was able to take 600 shots in RAW and still had enough battery left for another 200 shots. I am using Exiftool to convert the pics metadata to process in lightroom. Lightroom 5.3 should fix this issue. It is already out on beta release but I am waiting for the official release. I used 35mm 1.8g DX prime lens  and 24-85 FX lens on this camera. Camera automatically recognized the lens and worked in crop mode while using the DX lens. Even in crop mode, images had amazing detail and I was able to crop and still get a pretty decent picture. For all those who are familiar DX cameras, this camera is heavy and considerably heavier than the other DX models but is built like a tank. If you plan to use a tripod, this camera would require a very sturdy tripod. I used it on my old tripod ( my mistake:)) and almost dropped the camera.No sensor issues at 4000 shots so far.

The D800 seemed like overkill at 36MP, and the D600/610 lacked some of the pro features that the D700 had. But after a lot of research and agonizing, I decided to take a chance on the D610 and, so far, I'm really glad I did.I shoot weddings, events, and portraits professionally, and also do some freelance photojournalism. Low-light capabilities are really important to me, and the D700 has a well-earned reputation as an absolute beast in low light. I also like to use a two-body combination to avoid having to change lenses. For several years I'd been using the D700 with the 70-200 f/2.8 VRII, along with a D300S fitted with a Sigma 17-50 f/2.8. The combo served me well, but I was getting increasingly dissatisfied with the image quality on the D300S and tried to avoid going above ISO800 whenever possible. I seriously considered getting a second (used) D700 before ultimately deciding to go with the newer technology and higher megapixel count of the D610.These are my unscientific impressions, pro and con. If you need a detailed and/or technical review, there are plenty of them out there, and if you're about to spend two grand on a camera you should read them.The image quality is fantastic. Some friends described the D700 as \"magical\" in terms of image quality, and I agreed, but the D610 is even better. The colors and white balance seem more accurate, the tonal gradations more subtle, and while I used to think 12MP was more than enough, I can definitely see the advantage to having 24MP at my disposal. I was a little worried that the larger files would slow down my processing (I always shoot RAW), but I've got a pretty fast i7 Windows machine, and Lightroom5 works just fine. Yes, it takes longer to import and export and build previews, but the increased resolution and detail are worth the tradeoff. As one of my pro friends says, it's always better to have more megapixels than less. You can crop away or downsize if you need to, but you can't add them if they aren't there.It's a low-light beast -- just as good as, and maybe a little better than, the D700. You can shoot clean images at ISO1600 all day long; ISO3200 is no problem; and even 6400 is completely usable with a little noise-reduction in Lightroom.The autofocus system is very capable. This was one of my concerns, since the D610 uses only a 39-point system, compared to the 51 points in the D700 and other Nikons. According to the spec sheets and some reviews, the D610 wasn't supposed to perform as well in low light, but I've found to work just fine, especially when you have the AF-assist lamp activated. It's fast and accurate, especially when using the center point, which I do most of the time. It's not perfect - but my D700 isn't perfect, either. As many reviewers have said, the 39 points don't cover enough of the image area, but I haven't found this to be a serious problem.The body, while lacking some of the external controls of the D700 (and nearly identical D300S), is \"pro enough\" for me. It's a little smaller and lighter than either of those, but feels robust enough and comfortable in my average-sized hands, and it balances well with heavier lenses. I would prefer to have the other models' dedicated switches for focus mode and metering method, but I'm finding that I actually like the D610's position for the ISO button (bottom left on rear of the camera) better than the top position of the other two. Some users will also miss the separate AF-On button of the pro models, but you can program the D610's AE-L/AF-L switch to serve as a back-button focus if you like. Still, it's a little farther away from the command dial than the dedicated button on the other models. I'm not a big back-button focus user, so it's not a problem.This may seem like a small thing, but I love the shutter sound on the camera. It's somehow smoother or more muffled than the others, even when you're not shooting in \"Quiet Mode.\" The D700's shutter sounds like the crack of a rifle shot in comparison.All in all, I'm very happy with the camera. I still use the D700 a lot, but with every shoot, I'm finding that I'm ending up with more and more images from the D610, which I usually pair with the very good (though also not perfect) 24-120mm f/4.

Because of this, I passed, as should everyone else.  I was even considering spending the extra money on the D800, but they couldn't seem to get the left-side focus issues resolved, so I passed on that one too.

I'm picking up photography after 30 years away, and I wanted a good FX format. The first camera came, and I could not get the viewfinder to come in focus. I thought I just didn't know how to work the viewfinder - and I shot 300 frames before I figured out the diopter didn't work.So, I returned it (AMZN did a good job here, though I had to do the shipping myself). Second camera shows up the next day. First thing I did was unbox it, power it on with a lens, and you guessed right - same problem. It went right back in the box - I didn't shoot a single frame - and I'll return it when AMZN and I work out the how (the first camera hasn't even made it back to them yet).But what prompts my review here, is that the online research indicates this is a very, very common problem, which includes the D800. My measure of \"common problem\" was finding more than five other instances like mine where I was shipped two consecutive cameras with the same problem. That's either manufacturing problems or it's poorly engineered and gets broken in shipping.You can find out what a working diopter looks like by searching on YouTube for \"Nikon D610 Diopter\". I should have shot some video of what a broken version looks like, since I've had two of them, but suffice to say that on the first camera - I didn't even know there was a status line at the bottom of the viewfinder with the speed/fstop etc.This WAS the right camera for me - if the viewfinder worked, I'd recommend it with five stars.

My mother in law, who is a very advanced photographer was starting to use some of my shots for her desktop wallpaper, etc. After about 1500 clicks, I started to notice the specks on certain photos. After doing some research, I learned about the oil splatter issue, and returned the camera to Nikon for repair. They kept it for over a month due to a parts delay. Upon receiving the camera back from Nikon, it immediately had the oil issue again. First frame out of the box. I don't even think they did anything to my camera except possibly clean the sensor. I returned the camera once again, and this time the turn around was only about a week and a half. Again, spots on the sensor. So, I sold the camera to a friend of mine who is adept at sensor cleaning, and didn't seem to think it was that big of a deal. Next thing I know, the D610 is announced, and the word is that the shutter oil issue has been addressed. I decided to give Nikon one last try because I already had Nikon FX lenses, and the  PQ with the D600 was so outstanding, but promised myself that this would be the last chance they get due to cost. Well, I have had the camera since launch day, and I'm happy to say that it has been superb! So far, so good!

There seems to be a \"depth\" to my images now I didn't see so much with the D7100 (usually with a very good 16-85mm on it.) The dynamic range seems greater than the D7100 had (I can't quote specs on this, just saying I noticed a real-world difference in Lightroom right away.) I cannot imagine why I'd need more resolution (say, a D800) for the work I do, which includes the occasional 24x36-inch print of landscapes, which look fantastic IMHO.

The D610 is a great camera and the 24.3 mp sensor is much more forgiving than the D800's, especially for hand-held, natural light macro. And; my 65 year neck is very grateful; it's quite a bit lighter than the D800. Coupled with my 60mm micro-nikkor \"G\" lens, it's turning into a superb \"walking around\" camera. So far, after about a week, I've found the image quality to be excellent and my images are very sharp with the micro-nikkor. It's also very quiet. I'm used to the D800, which has a really noisy shutter release guaranteed to scare all the wildlife away.I only have two minor \"gee, I wish it would do this\" comments.  The auto-bracket function limits you to only 3 frames, at 0.3, 0.7, 1, 2 or 3 ev; not a deal-beaker, but I like to do HDR and I wish Nikon had designed the camera to do 5, or better  yet, 7 frames. The D800 will allow you to auto-bracket up to 9 frames but at no more than 1 ev increments. A little consistency, Nikon, please! Second, there doesn't seem to be a way of programming the multi-selector center button so that pushing it in playback mode immediately brings up the luminance histogram. You can do this with the D800 and I find it very convenient. Still the D610 costs a third less, so again, no deal-breaker.BTW, a bit of advice: If you want more objective reviews on the D610, go visit the product page on the B&H; Photo's website, in addition to Amazon's.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, despite what the D600 trolls are saying", "Author": "Mike G", "ReviewID": "R22072BNC0CFDJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I know it's crazy talk but, I think Amazon should only allow customers to review here if they actually own the camera.

This was definitely an overkill upgrade but I've always wanted to take professional grade photos.  I took the Michael Maven online D600 class which shows all features and settings (highly recommended) and purchased a few FX lenses: 1.4 50mm prime, 28-70mm 2.8 (refurbished), and a 70-300 4.5 VR2. I specifically waited until this camera came out due to all of the reported dust and oil issues from the D600.  After about 2000 shots, no dust or oil issues at all.As expected, picture quality is excellent.  There is a noticeable difference in contrast from my DX, even in auto mode.  The colors just seem to pop.  Also as expected, low light shots are brighter and can be shot with lower ISOs.  I'm not super impressed with the low light auto white balance but it's possible that it's on par with every other DSLR.  I just shoot in RAW so I can modify the white balance and exposure after the fact.  The auto white balance was supposedly modified from the D600 so not sure if it's improved or they made it worse!Overall it's a great camera and probably was a smart decision vs. the Canon 6D.

I urge everyone with a defective D600 to contact Nikon and and see about getting a replacement D610. The dismal handling of the sensor problem by Nikon has precipitated a class action suit against them for not properly addressing the D600 shutter box failure before now. Perhaps that got their attention. They had already replaced my shutter box and it did not adequately solve my problem so I again contacted them and they decided to replace my D600 with the new D610. Even if they have not already replaced your shutter box they may want to cut to the chase and offer to let you send your bogus D600 in and they'll then send you a new D610 within a couple of days. I guess I should give them some points for that but they dropped the ball big time waiting this long.Anyway, for those only having heard of the D600 problems don't let those reports discourage you from buying the D610. I received my new D610 from Nikon last week and am happy to report this camera generates the same high quality photos I got from the D600 when I purchased it over a year ago except without the dreaded spotting.I'll forgo effusive stories about the great images I got with the D600 when the spots were not visible because there have been countless other excellent reviews of the D600 and the D610 is identical in that regard MINUS the spots.

The WU-1B device does not connect to PC using a router, only mobile devices. I bought Nikon 1.8 and 2.8 lens. Aperture mode doesn't appear consistent in exposure level from wide opening to smaller apertures. The image taken at wide open appears to be always slightly darker than the rest. It's only slightly but no big deal. It can be fixable by adjusting shutter speed or ISO. I tested aperture mode range using D300 and D7100 and it appears to produce the same results so I would guess it's the general Nikon camera itself. Nikon probably thinks it's no big deal fixing this little problem that no one has complained about or notice. In White Balance, it has incandescent and no tungsten like Canon camera has.

My first forray into the world of FX.  Granted that it will be my bday/xmas presents for the next 5 years and then some, but it was worth it. I have taken close to 120,000 shots with my old D80 and D7000.  I thought that I have gotten some sharp pictures.  I was wrong. One thing that attracted me to D610 is the fact that most functions and dials are very close to D7000.  I was able to adapt to the camera without much effort. That was the deciding factor between the D610 and D800.  The D610 with the help of the 24-70mm lens is allowing me to be able to take shots in low-light condition that I have not been able to do with the D7000.  The D610/lens combo has allowed me to take very sharp pictures of my youngest at full speed during one of his recent soccer game.  The 6 frames per second seemed very responsive.  Comparing to my D7000, the D610 performs much better, producing much sharper images.  So far, I have not had to use Lightroom 5.0 to correct many pictures.I have not had a chance to test the video, but then again, call me old-timer, but I use the DSLR for still pictures.  I use my Sony HD video recorder for the specific purpose of recording motion!  If by chance I need a quick recording of the current event, then I use the video portion of the DSLR with no expectation other than to capture the moment!There are only two regrets that I have: 1) I miss my 18-200mm DX lens, much more versatile and lighter.  The zoom during a sporting event is needed, but it will have to wait until after I have recovered monetarily wise.  I am, however, eyeing on the 70-300mm f4.5-5.6.  That will complete the 24-70mm and 50mm 1.8 that I already have (can't afford the 70-200mm f2.8 ... had I won the mega millions on Tues ... the world of photography would have been mine!),  2) The second is letting go my four DX lenses and the D7000 which are being passed down to my son.  They are in good hands with him!  His \"hand-me-down\" D80 is being passed down even further to his younger brother.I currently own Nikon D610 as well as Canon Elph 520 point and shoot and Sony NEX-5R (not to mention my trusty Canon AE-1).  I love them all.  They each have their own unique strength.  Btw, for those who will try to goat me into the \"debate,\" I will respectfully decline to answer or comment.  This is my review of the product that I own, how I feel about what I bought, and how THIS product has performed for ME! ... and yes ... this is my first review ... and no ... I don't spend time to review all of the items that I purchased from Amazon.  It takes too much time!Update: Jan 1, 2014Took 952 shots (10.92GB), varying locations and venues, daylight to night time.  The D610 performed as well as its user's ability (me).  I got great shots and then some that are not so great (mostly due to low-light without a tripod).  I poured over the pictures by enlarging them in Adobe Lightroom and there were NO oil spots as indicated by a couple of the reviewers.  Perhaps, I am such an amateur that I don't know what an oil spot on the sensor looks like if it hits me square on the face!  Now, there were four shots that have spots (water spots), but there was a light sprinkle of rain during our outing.  Side-by-side with my sons' D7000 and D80, the D610's shots were sharper.  My third son was using my Sony NEX-5R. In the low-light, I had the ISO up to 3200 with no noise (f2.8). The D7000 was able to keep up.  The Sony NEX-5R struggled with the low light without the flash.  The D80 could not stay clean that high of ISO.  In the bright daylight, I like the Sony NEX-5R colors the best, then comes the D610 and then the D7000.One other interesting note that I didn't include before (due to the fact that it might cause controversy), an old friend bought the D600 about 7 months ago.  I did ask him about the D600's problem(s) during my 6 month research of the D600 and the D800 (while saving up the $).  To date, he has not had any.  Perhaps, he is one of the lucky ones.  I have seen his pictures of his daughters during their volleyball tournaments as well as his son's theatrical performances.  They were very sharp even under low light conditions.  He uses the 70-200mm, f2.8 lens.  These pictures were reasons why I decided to upgrade from my D7000!I will update if things change with my D610. As of today, I still love my new D610.

Now, let's talk Nikon! I have been a Nikon shooter for over 40 years. I guess I haven't found a compelling reason to use anything else. If you are thinking of making the transition to an FX (full frame) camera, you might want to have a look at the new Nikon D610! I have been shooting with DX cameras and hadn't made the leap to FX due, entirely, to their price tags! But, as with all things digital, the prices will eventually come down.I decided on buying the FX format D610 camera because of 1) price and 2) similarity to equipment I already use. Allow me to explain. When the D7100 was released for sale back in March 2013, I pre-ordered one to backup my D300s. The D7100 turned out to be my primary camera and the D300s became my backup! When Nikon announced the D610 I discovered that it uses the same battery as the D7100. And that the controls are nearly identical to the D7100. That's what did it for me!I already owned 2 FX lenses which I've been using on my DX cameras, so the upgrade was less painful. FX lenses are expensive and the ones I already had were perfect for the D610 and the type of photos I make. Having said that, my DX lenses will work well on the D610 - which gives me the option of an auto-crop function (1.5X factor)  to accommodate DX lenses.The controls are in the same location as the D7100 which made for a short learning curve on the D610. I have just started making photos with the 610 and so far, I am very happy with the results. The overall pixel dimensions are only slightly larger than the 7100 - 4016 X 6016, where the 7100 is 4000 X 6000. The real difference is the FX format is that the pixels are larger on the larger FX sensor and the file sizes are about 8 mb larger. That doesn't sound like much until you need to apply a major crop to an image - in that case, I'll take all the pixels I can get.The D610 is a speed demon! 6 high resolution RAW frames per second! A word of caution tho on FPS ratings. You need to be using an extreme SDHC card with a write speed of 94 mb/sec or faster. Not all UHS-1 rated cards are equal. You'll find them rated as UHSC-1, Class 10 with speeds ranging from 45 mb/sec to 95 mb/sec. The higher the card speed, the faster you can shoot! Amazon sells some Sony 16gb SDHC card, twin packs (2 cards) for around $35. (see my review on these cards posted elsewhere)I'll be updating this review as I make more photographs with this amazing camera. I decided to give my first impressions if it'd help someone who is debating on going to the FX format. Go for it!______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________MAY 2014 UPDATE on my D610...I have made just over 5000 images since I bought the camera 6 months ago. Guess what? I LOVE THIS CAMERA and, NO, there aren't any sensor spots which plagued the D600. Nikon solved this problem by redesigning the shutter in the D610. It's my understanding that Nikon will replace the shutter in your D600 at no charge and you'll find info on that at the NikonUSA web site. Now, back to the D610...IMHO, this is the best bang for the buck! As I mentioned in my earlier review, the D610 and the D7100 are very similar in form and function, with a couple of minor diffs. The ISO on the D610 will go down to 25 ISO and the D7100 has a minimum ISO rating of 100. Not a problem. The ISO settings button on the D610 is located one button lower than the D7100. I have recently decided to shoot using the Auto ISO setting and it works very well. The image quality is what I've grown to expect from Nikon - superb! In fact, I purchased the new Nikkor 105 f-2.8 Micro lens, which I can use on both bodies. It's the first Nikkor Micro that has VR (vibration reduction) and when I mount it on the D7100 it becomes a 157 mm f-2.8 which is great for shooting things that can do you harm and the additional distance can get you out of the way of the available light.The D610 is great camera! If you don't have a few extra thousand $ to spend on the D4s or the D800e, this is a no-brainer for getting into an FX camera.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Images!", "Author": "seamus", "ReviewID": "RMDDOSYV5VXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon D600I didn't buy my camera from Amazon-got it as a surprise gift from wife who knew I wanted it.

Very happy with it, had the automatic sensor cleaner on at both start up and shut down, and it looked like the pictures were clear. I went on a two week vacation the day after getting the camera, NEVER changed the lens (so doubtful much dust would have gotten in via lens changing), and was pretty happy. Then, I got home where I was able to download my pictures onto my home computer w/ 21\" monitor and start doing some conversions to B&W;, that's when I saw it - a multitude of sensor spots on the image. Sensor clean and blowing w/ a Giotto blower did no good. So I packed up the camera and returned it. I think that the spots probably would have disappeared w/ a wet cleaning, but here's the catch - Nikon requires that only a certified Nikon facility clean the camera, or warranty is voided. And I just didn't want to get on the carousel of sending my camera to California every time I had sensor spots that could not be removed by regular means. I clean my own Nikon D70s with a swab with no issues, and if Nikon didn't have warnings to consumers about the D610 needing to be returned to Nikon for cleaning to keep the warranty, I'd probably have cleaned it and kept the camera, But better to send it back while I can still get a refund.As for the 28-300 lens - loved it.Shoulder bag - great, and worked wonderfully on my road trip to carry my camera, computer, power cords, etc.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Glad I waited for the 610", "Author": "Matthew McLelland \"outdoor guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2O33U7X6DXVUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted - really wanted - to buy the 600 a year ago but like most of you, was scared by the thousands of negative reviews for white balance issues and dust spots.

I hope Nikon suffers because of this - its a classic example of how not to respond to a flawed product.

Certainly more fair than the other D600 owners who flamed this new version in other reviews below. To be clear, I don't own the D610 also, but have put the D600 (same exact camera/sensor, but with different shutter) through the paces.I moved up to full-frame after using a Nikon D5100 APS-c camera for a few years. First trip out with it was to Zion NP and the Grand Canyon. The controls are easy to use and certainly a step up for me having more buttons on camera with direct access to ISO, WB, and more. As others have and will mention, the RAW image quality just blows you away. Even after 7 months, when I import files into my MacBook, I still can't believe how good the dynamic range, detail, and colors are. Furthermore, if you really want to play with the images in Aperture/LR, it's amazing how far you can stretch them without degrading the image quality. Lifting shadows or dimming highlights if necessary expands the already great DR. The Sony sensors that Nikon has been using in here and in others really are the best on the market right now. I can't imagine needing anything more than 24 megapixels unless I were a pro making wall-sized prints.Since I wasn't heavily vested in the Nikon system before, and had used and enjoyed Canon cameras in the past, I took several months debating between the D600/610 and the Canon 6D. The Nikon seemed like a clear winner but was still hesitant because of the dust/oil issue (and Canon does have a nice lens offering). Now that the shutter has been replaced in the D610, I really think it's no contest. Unless you're heavily vested in Canon glass, the D610 is the way to go. The 100% viewfinder coverage really seals the deal. After using 95% coverage in my old D5100 (the 6D is 97%), I couldn't stand 'guessing' at what was going to be in the edges of the frame and really didn't want to have to live with that again in a $2k camera.I bought a new 18-35G lens with mine which has been great too. It is unfortunate Nikon has kind of screwed many of the D600 owners by not originally addressing the dust issue, but for what it is the D600/610 is an absolutely phenomenal camera.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera - lousy Nikon customer loyalty practices", "Author": "Gene Piatigorski", "ReviewID": "R21ZA4HBDD9X1F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to get into the FX format. My current camera is the D7000 (that I love too). My previous camera was the Nikon D80. Before that I owned various Nikon film cameras, that I no longer use.I sympathize with those that purchased the D600, and I am just as pissed off about Nikon's lack of customer loyalty by not providing a remedy for the D600 fiasco. My recommendation to those that still have the Nikon warranty and their state laws allow it, to claim 'lemon' law for the camera after the 3 sensor cleaning attempts from the Nikon customer service and the re-occurrence of the spot issue after the cleaning has been performed.I tested my D610 for the sensor spots by shooting at F22 as soon as it came out of the box. My camera does NOT have the issue. The sensor appears to be squeaky clean - first out of the box, and then after the many test shots.I was considering the Canon 5D Mark III because of the D600 fiasco. Since I am a long-time (decades) Nikon camera user, I have a collection of lenses and that tipped the scale for me towards the Nkon D610 given the multiple reviews that informed me that this camera does not seem to suffer from the sensor spots issues. I also considered the Sony A7 (and A7R), as well as the Nikon D800. Sony was ruled out for the same reason as the Canon. Although, I was intrigued by the smaller form factor in a full frame package. However, the current lack of body-specific lenses for the A7 was another reason I wound up eliminating the Sony. Since the lenses that fit the body currently were not designed to be physically smaller to match the body size. The D800 was too much camera for my needs and was too slow for my most frequent use cases - sports/action photograhy. I did not want to deal with the size of the files coming from the D800 (I typically shoot RAW to be able to post-process). I also considered getting the D7100. If I did not own the D7000 already, I would probably have settled for that. However great the D7100 features are, that camera is not significantly different from the D7000 for my needs, tipping the scale towards the D610 (since I wanted a full frame camera in the first place).The D610, for me, represents the best value for my purposes. Part of me wishes that I could have the budget to invest into the Canon lens market and purchased the 5D M3 just to keep solidarity with the D600 customers who have been treated very unfairly by Nikon. Unfortunately, at this time I can not. Given the opportunity in the future, I will likely move away from Nikon.

Bear in mind that others that are coming from a Sony might find this more helpful or anyone who has never used a Nikon.I am coming from 7yrs of using Sony Alpha (700 & 77)and the reason I changed was the noise performance on Sony's is dreadful.Now, I can see the weight being an issue from hand-holding this all day (same I used to do with the Sony). The grip in comparison is smaller so there isnt the same comfort level when walking or moving about. I did this throughout the day but I was more aware of my grip then normal.There are a ton of features/options on this camera so that takes some time to understand them and find the right mix. I was a big fan of the in camera enhancement on the Sony for vividness but have yet to dial that in on the Nikon.At the moment I am not a fan of the selection method for such things as ISO, WB & Metering - the need to perform this with dual buttons is cumbersome and tedious.I can also say from when the moment that you take a picture, it saves to the memory card and is ready for viewing - the Nikon is much slower then the Sony.All in all I am neutral at the moment on this purchase - in the back of my mind I am wondering if the Canon 6D would have been a better choice. Time will tellPS - I did forget to mention that it appears as if I already might have spots on the sensor...I am not as forgiving on products as the cost increase so at the $3K range - not pleased.**UPDATE 4/6/14**Ok, I am uploading two pictures from a series of tests that now unfortunately make my decision to send this product back.

When you are doing a long exposure shot, make sure you use your eye piece cover or else light will leak into it and onto your sensor. In addition, I have read that this issue happens to other nikon's higher end cameras, like the d700. Still, I think this is really poor designing on nikon's part. Why does my entry level nikon d7000 have no issue with light leaking into the eyepiece yet a more expensive, semi pro d610 have this issue is beyond me. Maybe it was a marketing strategy. Maybe they want the inconvenience of placing on that eyepiece every time we shoot long expo so it will annoy us enough to buy more expensive nikon cameras like the D3x or something.

I became an early digital convert and have been waiting patiently for a full-frame digital camera that made sense for me to buy and leverage my base of full frame lenses.  i've never liked the DX format when it comes to wide angle shots.  The specs of the D600 and D800 are outstanding and both cameras feel great, but I watched in disbelief as Nikon let this D600 shutter issue play out on the Internet.  Now it appears to be addressed with the D610 and my experience with the camera has been excellent.  My concern now is that a company that manages product issues in such poor fashion with their loyal customer base is probably going to fail in long run.  The market is too competitive.  Canon and Sony and others have great products.  Nikon needs to treat its customers better if is going to survive as a company.  The D600 issue was such a basic product/PR issue and Nikon seemed clueless about doing the right thing.  I would have bought the 600 or 800 earlier if this issue hadn't played out over the past year, but I am hesitant to invest further in such a poorly managed company.  Nikon should be doing something for its d600 owners --- trade-in, credit, rebuild --- and should start by admitting and managing the issue straight up.  Product issues happen --- Nikon needs to show that it has the integrity to do the right thing to maintain its brand and customer base.  I can assume from Nikon's past history that if there's a problem with the D610, then they will burry their heads and focus on a D620.

I feel horrible for anyone that kept the D600 and now has a faulty camera out of warranty that has (essentially) been decommissioned from Nikon as a faulty product they don't want to fix. Thus the D610: a Nikon D600 with no dust and oil issues.For those who didn't get caught up in the D600 disaster, the D610 is a great camera in almost all aspects. For photographers, it offers great performance and features in a full frame camera. For videographers, you may want to skip the D610 as you can't change the aperture while recording or in live view making changing your exposure just about impossible. It's a bummer because the quality was very good but this made it unusable for me. Back to photographs, I'm in awe by the amount of dynamic range in the camera (shooting RAW) and love dual SD card slots and the heavy duty body (although it has a more plastic feel than the Canon 7D). It is a great all around camera and I love the photo quality I am able to achieve. It feels and operates more like a pro camera than the Canon 6D and has a good (but not unbelievable) AF system.However, a DSLR is more than just a camera because you are buying an ecosystem. You will be investing in a company with lenses, batteries, bodies, and will likely be sticking with that company for a long time for future cameras as you will be stuck with proprietary gear. As a result I have a difficult time recommending the D610 for those not already stuck in Nikon gear. The D610 is a great camera in many respects but Nikon has fumbled the ball big time and failed to stand up to a widespread product defect that I had. Nikon is a professional brand and a pro needs to be able to rely on their equipment and the brand behind it to fix/solve every issue. Thankfully my D800 has not had as many issues (though has had some that Nikon will not address) but I can no longer recommend the D610 for anyone not stuck with Nikon at this point. For those heavily invested in Nikon gear, The D610 is a great camera but I would not rely on it for a long term investment.

Nikon neglect their clients who have put faith in them in the form of their hard earned money, and decided to re-release the D600 with a new shutter mechanism and name it the D610. All while still not addressing us the D600 owners and early adopters.

Why did I give them a 1 star review?  Because I was very upset with Nikon's handling of the D600, the camera that's nearly identical to this one.  They never admitted a problem, gave simple \"have you tried not changing the lenses in a dust filled area?\" responses, and after attempting to fix my D600 a few times, I have simply given up on that and came to an understanding with Nikon.  That's all I will say about that.The D610 on its own merits is a solid 4.25 star full frame camera.  Why not 5 star?  because it's still using the same sensor as the D600 which came out last year.  It's a year old sensor being sold today for $100 cheaper than the D610 did initially.  The AF points are still somewhat centered in the middle but in the real world, very usable.  I should know, I've used the D600 for a year.  The sensor is still one of the best full frame ones out there so having used the D600 and spending some time with the D610, it will likely be my next camera.I wish it was't like this.  I wish I would have just bought the D600 and there were no issues and Nikon would have offered a recall but they didn't.  Still, I don't see myself ever going to Canon (that was a bluff) - Sony, maybe but not Canon.  No need to bash Nikon anymore.  They have learned their lesson hopefully.  They have brought dishonor to themselves with the D600 so maybe now they will follow the righteous path.Update *March 2014*I was looking for a camera to replace my D600 and decided to buy the D610 after the first price drop.
