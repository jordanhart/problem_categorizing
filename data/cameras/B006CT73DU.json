{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not the real deal!", "Author": "Tamara Quandt", "ReviewID": "R1ELDCRV870ZCN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When someone is selling a product for $20+ less than everyone else - buyer beware. This camera (box) is the Australian version, and not the one manufactured to be sold in the US. This would be fine, except I'm not sure the camera in the box is the real deal because it did not come with the Mac software installed that the box and instructions clearly said that it had. It also appears to be missing some other key features.....possibly a fake made in China? I will hopefully be able to return this piece of junk, and happily spend the extra money to get the real one at Best Buy.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006CT73DU"}}
