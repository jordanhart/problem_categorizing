The accessories are crap. The tripod fell apart upon removing it from the box, it wont even support the camera without tilting or collapsing the legs.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just buy the camera and accessories ala cart", "Author": "J. Mcginnis", "ReviewID": "R35QIMFJ3MXJC7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am new to DSLR so I bought this \"kit\" which had many things I just didn't need or want. The camera bag is not very impressive; it's okay but I bought a real Nikon one instead. The tripod is not that great; small and unstable. I ended up buying a different more stable tripod. When these items are purchased as a \"kit\" you cannot exchange or return just some of the items; you are stuck with the whole thing. I didn't really consider this at the time as I was very excited about the new Camera. The extra lens is a good lens, however, you might want to price them separately, as with the other items.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hard to take a bad photo", "Author": "D. Cox \"little hands\"", "ReviewID": "R3F44AHHVEWZS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The D3200 is a great DSLR for beginners or advanced. The kit was great. The bag was smaller than I thought. It holds the accessories sent with the kit but if you have more than two lens and one flash, you will need to go buy a much bigger bag like I did. The tripod is a little weak but I didn't need one - I already have 3 more professional grade. I actually looked for kits that did not have a tripod and replaced it for some other needed accessory but it seems like everyone wants to include a tripod with a kit. I'll probably give this one away to someone who doesn't have one because the ones I have are so much better.Overall, for the price I give this a 5 starts because the things I needed were there and it arrived ahead of schedule. I absolutely love this camera. Buy an external flash, wireless flash, or flash kit. The built in flash will work in a pinch but I don't recommend using it on a regular basis.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera + kit nikon", "Author": "kakario", "ReviewID": "RJ24YKEC6TXRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything arrived as ad.

Should have shopped around a little more. The camera is great. I'm sure if I got into photography very seriously I could think of features it doesn't have that I'd want, but for an amateur like me it is outstanding. It's the only reason this got 3 stars instead of 2. The accessories that come with this camera kit are bottom tier quality. The tripod is sufficient, but rickety, the memory card is off-brand (we'll see how soon it fails, I only hope it doesn't have precious pictures on it when it does), and the bag is a bit smaller than expected. The package might be worth it if the second lens was the 55-300 instead of 55-200, but the features of the 55-200 don't exceed the stock 18-55 lens enough for me to consider this purchase a good deal.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Kit", "Author": "Matias Castro Cancino", "ReviewID": "R2G9VBTQE16ZN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome kit, great pieces, great camera and zoom lens... it has everything you need to start in the photography world", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,149.99", "Features": "Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera Body - Black (Includes manufacturer's supplied accessories)\nNikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens - Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor Lens - Deluxe Lens Care & Cleaning Kit\n32 Gigabyte SDHC Secure Digital Memory Card - Secure Digital USB Card Reader - Universal Memory Card Wallet - Pack of LCD Screen Protectors\nAdditional EN-EL14 Reachargeable Lithium ion Replacement Battery - Well Padded Multi Compartment Gadget Bag with Pockets & Strap\nFull Size 59\" Tripod W/Case - Jumpstart Guide to Digital SLR Cameras - BONUS!!
