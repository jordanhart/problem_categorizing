I remained loyal to Sony because I like their products and this DSLR camera was the best I could afford.  As a strictly amateur photographer with zero ability, the A65 is very forgiving.  I am enjoying learning all the new features it has to offer.  The HD video and mirror less lens technology in the A65 is stunning.  Well done Sony, this is a great product.I bought my package via Amazon.  My order arrived early, nothing was missing, so I rate everyone in the supply chain 5 Stars for a job well done.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Chris Hefner", "ReviewID": "R1GIXI2LULTK74", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this camera a few weeks ago and took it on a trip.  We shot mostly in automatic - no flash mode and the majority of the pictures came out beautifully.  Some looked downright professional!The one complaint I have about is the menus feel a bit scattered to me.  You really have to dig around to find a mode or operation you are looking for.  And when you find it, it isn't a simple matter of remembering next time.  I find myself struggling to recall the right buttons to repeat simple procedures like simply viewing the stored images.Whilouby's was great.  The spare battery they included in the package did not work so they sent a new one immediately.  They even included a prepaid padded envelope to return the defective battery.All around I am very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding camera and lens", "Author": "Setter Dog \"Jack\"", "ReviewID": "R35U7UNW450EPX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this kit to go along with my a57 camera. I'm not much of a lens changer and like to have two cameras on my frequent trips to Yellowstone and Teton.I can't imagine a better all around camera and lens than the a65 with the 18-135mm lens. Personally, I prefer the EVF of Sony DSLRs to the OVFs on the other brands. With the EVF, you can see everything about the picture before you press the shutter button.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008MMKOE0"}}
