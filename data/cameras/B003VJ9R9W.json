The camera uses BNC connectors.The package was mailed from Schenzen, China and arrived in 11 calendar days.  To be fair, it arrived before the projected date.The first problem, a big one, was the power adapter had a European plug (two round prongs) instead of a U.S.  So I went to Radio Shack and overpaid $11.00 for a European-to-U.S. adapter.  A U.S. CCTV seller sells an almost identical converter for $90, so the less than $23 I paid for this converter plus the $11.00 was still a bargain.Second, one of the toggle buttons, the one marked PP, was stuck.  After about 30 minutes of jiggling and pulling on it, I got it to work.Those problems resolved, it worked OK.  It does what I wanted it to do.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Display", "Author": "Disappointed Customer", "ReviewID": "RPBHR3TLIACY5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Once everything was connected the picture would fade in and out or disappear completely.

We had a goofy document image camera that needed conversion from just video to VGA and this thing did the trick.  However, I did notice if the video became too hot ( over 100 units on the scope ) it didn't seem to be able to handle it very well.  Also I notice on some monitors a thin line down the left side like horizontal blanking was off a bit but that did not appear on every monitor so it may just be with some.  For the price and what it does - you can't go wrong.  Just don't expect the highest quality image output for broadcast quality commercial use but for personal and some industrial applications this unit is a life saver.  Also it has still store on it so you can load up a black frame or something else and have it send that out - in case you need to be able to send some type of signal down the wire when you are using a ABCD switcher and keep your monitors from flipping out or shutting off because you aren't feeding them a signal.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good unit with poor documentation", "Author": "Karen Holmes", "ReviewID": "RGXLAXIMCT2ZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used this device to convert the BNC video-out jack of a security DVR into the analog VGA signal needed by a cheap PC monitor.

It's almost as if the manufacturers of the Security systems know they can make a ton of money by selling their own monitors.

All you need to do is input the BNC signal into the box and then output your VGA signal to a standard computer monitor. There is a power source for this box, but it is one simple plug. This is the bottom line when the monitor that came with your system dies.Short and Sweet: Don't be fooled!

I do, however, have an extra monitor that takes DVI, VGA, or HDMI.Turns out it is quite hard to connect these two devices. Who knew?After looking around and trying out some S-Video and RCA to VGA adapters I discovered that these adapters seem to never work. I was reminded after a quick trip to Google that S-Video uses a completely different separation of data than VGA and RCA. To have any conversion take place between S-Video and VGA you actually have to have something with a microchip to make the switch-over.Found this, bought it (it comes with an S-Video cable!) plugged in my cable box's S-Video into this converter, then connected the converter via VGA to the monitor. BAM. I don't have to buy a TV to watch Law & Order re-runs.NOTE: my monitor also had in-build speakers. I hooked these up with a splitter that converts RCA Red+White male audio into a 3.5mm male headphone jack. They are super cheap on Amazon ($1-$2).
