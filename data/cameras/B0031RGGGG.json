Having owned many Kodak digital cameras over the years (probably 6 or 7), the current point and shoot models just don't cut it.  Why, then did I buy another Kodak?  It was for my son's 6th birthday.  His Grandmother bought him one of the kid digital cameras with something like .5MP and he showed a knack for using a camera (he would place his toys or stuffed animals on the floor and lay down on the floor to get a eye level shot).  I only purchased this camera based primarily on price with the secondary reason being brand.  For this price, there aren't many choices from brand names and the other brands were \"off brands\" or weren't much better than the kid camera we were replacing.You get what you pay for.  I don't expect much from a $70 camera, but my son has already figured out how to program it to use the scene mode and has used the video.  He likes it and that'a all that matters.  I wouldn't be satisfied with the quality and surely wouldn't use it for preserving familiy moments, but it will get put to good use and hopefully will get my son interested in photography.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "outstanding value and quality", "Author": "Rockkeeper \"Rockkeeper\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q3NAF6WI537Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a great camera, at a great price....cool color, there was a clicking type sound at initial use but I have used for 3 weeks and it has gone away, uses 2 AA batteries.....still on my first set so it does not \"eat\" batteries.

This camera is powered by 2 AA batteries, with an Alkaline pair being included, but Kodak does sell rechargeable AA batteries with a charger- \"Kodak Mini-Charger\" which I found on an auction site for $15.

We've owned more expensive \"cheap\" cameras that didn't feel as nice as this one.  Sure, it isn't as nice as my point-and-shoot, but for what you pay, you get a great camera!  It is also surprisingly durable.  My daughter doesn't abuse the camera, but she is a kid, so it gets tossed in her bag, bumped around a bit, and it is still working great - after over 9 months!!Now, I'm looking to buy another of these cameras for my other daughter.

So its nice not to have to take time to to adjust the settings, you can just point and click! I haven't used the share feature yet to upload to facebook, flick, ect. But I have heard good things about it and will once I get an eye fi card.Also, one thing almost had me returning the camera. When I would be looking at the display before taking a photo, the screen was noticeably pixelized. However, reviewing the photos they appeared clear and was clear when uploading them on the computer. A few days later I got some new rechargeable battery's ( I had been using cheap ones from the dollar store)and bam! The pixels where gone! As the battery's got lower the pixels would reappear, but its not really an issue since the photos still take very clear and it doesnt interfere with taking the photos.
