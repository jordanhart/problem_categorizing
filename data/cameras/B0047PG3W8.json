The camera stand is not very good.

The tripod is just ok and has limited usability, but it was essentially free so not a big deal. If you plan to travel much, this bag my not be sufficent for protecting your expensive equipment. If you're looking for a light, backpack style bag to carry on you for the day, this is a good deal.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0047PG3W8"}}
