{"Reviews": [{"Title": "COMPATIBILITY ISSUES", "Author": "ECHO DUDE", "ReviewID": "R2OJCMVWUQETF9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before you purchase this thermostat make sure you know what kind of heating system you have. The TSAT-100 is not compatible with HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS. The instructions that come with TSAT-100 states that if you have a heat pump system you should order the TSAT-300. The TSAT-300 has the ability to control the reversing valve in the heat pump system while the tsat-100 does not have this capability. I had a great deal of difficulty trying to find where I could purchase the 300. Finally, I contacted the manufacturer (interlogix) directly. They produce the 300 for GE Security. What i found out is that the 300 is produced sporadically. Sometimes its available, sometimes it is not; and you have to order it from one of interlogix\"s distributors. They (interlogix) will not sell it directly to the consumer. Also, i could not find the 300 on amazon, and surveillent (the distributor from whom I purchased the TSAT 100) doesn't carry it. As a side note, if you order from Surveillent, don't expect a warm and fuzzy experience from their customer service department. After receiving the product, I found their response to my initial request for just basic additional information to be somewhat combative.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0043L70T6"}}
