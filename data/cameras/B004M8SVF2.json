Welsh", "ReviewID": "RP8CJA8UYBV0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera with alot of fun features. I had a hard time deciding between the s8100 and the s6100 because the s8100 takes faster pictures, 1080 video, a better sensor, and bigger zoom.The features listed below are the reasons I chose the s6100.Touch screen--can use your finger but it can be a little tricky to move it just right.  It does come with a stylus that allows you to move through the screens quickly. Makes it very easy to get through the menus.  The menu on the left has the options for flash, self-timer, macro, and exposure compensation.  The menu on the bottom has the options for touch shutter, image mode, movie options, and settings. The battery levels are always displayed in the left hand corner so there is no guessing how much battery is left.  Above that the scene mode is displayed.Scene selection--There are 19 scenes to choose from plus the scene auto selector.  When you push the scene button and all 20 options are listed there is a question mark box in the upper right hand corner that will explain the different modes to help you choose the right one.Filter Effects--It has the ability to draw or write on photos, add decorations, cross screen, fish eye, selective color, black and white, sepia.  I have messed around with a few of these features, I will try to upload a few pictures.  It also has glamour retouch and skin softening.Playback button--Has options to star a photo as favorite, delete, slide show, protect, print, draw, retouch, voice record, and settings.Charger--This camera can charge through your computer or it also has an adapter much like most cell phones now do so you can use the USB cord to charge using an outlet.  There is a light on the back that flashes to let you know it is charging.The dedicated movie button makes it very simple to record videos. Unlike the 8100, you cannot take a photo while you are recording with the 6100.From the opinion of a hobby photographer, I think there are alot of features nicely packaged into this pocket-sized camera.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Point and Shoot Camera", "Author": "stepheroni090", "ReviewID": "R2ECY2EUTGUWUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera while looking for a small yet high quality point and shoot style camera.  This camera has great features in a small enough package to bring on the go.  The optical zoom works wonderfully.  Touch-Panel LCD is a nice feature.Only complaint I have with the camera is the image review after taking a picture lasts a seemingly long time. If you are trying to take multiple pictures quickly it can be annoying as the previous image takes up the screen so you can't preview your next picture.  Also, the touch-panel LCD isn't as responsive as you'd like it to be, but if you use the included stylus on the wrist strap it works just fine.  Just don't expect iPod Touch-quality responsiveness.Bottom line:Purchase this camera if you are looking for a point and shoot camera with good features, optical zoom, and a decent MegaPixel rating that come in a small package.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "There must be better cameras", "Author": "pfe", "ReviewID": "R3EDG12H5O0LB7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for 3-months and waited until now to write a review because it was a gift and I really wanted to like this camera. But the more I've used it the less I like it. To be fair, it can take a descent picture under optimal conditions if you are careful, but so can a 1968 Kodak Brownie in the right hands. I really expected more from Nikon and modern electronic technology.Let me give you a little more background... I'm 63 years old and I've been taking pictures since I was 8 years old. Last winter I suffered a stroke which affected the coordination in my left hand and I found it difficuly to operate my Nikon D50 SLR. My wife, trying to be nice to me bought an S6100 for my birthday because she assumed that a point-and-shoot would be easier and less frustrating for me to use than my D50 SLR. I was excited to get it and try it out. The Nikon S6100 was smaller, lighter and easier to carry. As far as being easier to use,it is NOT! A person would expect an automatic point-and-shoot camera to be just that, point it, press the shutter release and get a fair picture most of the time. That's something this camera can't do with any regularity. A pox on Nikons house for the damn touch screen controls! Why have a touch screen shutter release function that duplicates the function of the shutter release button? While you try to hold the camera with your right hand you are almost forced to touch the screen while trying to frame the image and push the \"real button\". This more often than not activates the shutter resulting in a picture of the ground, your pant leg, or shoe. Then while you wait for the exceedingly slow electronics to store that image on the memory card, you miss several oportunities to try for a good shot. Would that this was the only problem with the touch screen. Nikon designed this cameras controls so the ONLY way to control various camera functions is through a menu system controlled using the touch screen. If that were not bad enough the screen itself is not sensitive enough to respond well to a finger touch unless you use a long finger nail or the little stylus hung on the wrist strap. This almost insures that you can't make any sort of quick option changes while you try to shoot. You may wonder if that screen does anything else. Yes, it shows a fairly bright image to use as a viewfinder or to review pictures of your shoes taken by mistake. Of course it is constantly smugged and dirty because you have to be touching it all the time.How about the overall function? The S6100 is as functional as most of it's competitors in the crowded point-and-shoot field. It's a snapshot camera at best loaded with difficult to control features and totally unecessary post shooting editing functions that are much better done on your computer after you download the pictures. I expected better from Nikon and I certainly thought that a 16 megapixel sensor would capture better quality shots. Again I was disappointed. My 6 megapixel D50 captures better images and it's over 5-years old. In anything other than optimal light, the automatic functions of the S6100 bump up the ISO a few clicks and once that's happened the image quickly gets grainy without gaining good exposure. Again I sure expected better from the newer class of sensors and software. The S6100 can also take Quicktime movies with a single press of the movie button on the back. This would be a nice function if the movie button were not small  placed directly below the right side thumb grip, almost ensuring that you will take some short movies you didn't want, again usually of the ground, your shoe, or the sky.Oh, and then there is battery life. Not too good. I can get maybe 200 shots and a short movie before the \"battery exhausted\" message pops up on the screen, and then you are done since the only way to recharge it is to plug the whole camera into the charger or a computer USB port, you will be out of luck in the field unless you invest in a second battery, keep it charged and in your pocket while you'r out shooting.Do you think I've been be too negative about the S6100?Here are the good things about it:1. It's small, light, and fits easily in a shirt pocket or purse2. The zoom lens is Nikon, and they do make the best optics and the wide to full zoom is all you will probably ever need.3. When you manage to get a snap shot it's usually of adequate quality, at least for your family album.MY RECOMMEDATIONS:If you want a point-and shoot Nikon, check out the S8100 or S9100, both much better cameras at only a slightly higher price.If you want great pictures and care about control of your camera functions get a Digital SLR and learn how to use it.If you want a touch screen get a smart phone. Most of those will take pictures and movies too, and might be easier to use than this camera, plus when you get frustrated with the smugged up touch screen, at least you can use it to call someone who cares.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "great mid level point and shoot", "Author": "mg", "ReviewID": "R1LV27C170DU37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about 4 hours now, so I am obviously a professional here.  But I am amazed at this camera.  I'll try and keep it short.  The camera pictures are great indoors, great outdoors, great macro, good 7x opti zoom, Good white balance, great low light.  Functionally, it is a simple interface, fast start to shoot time about 2-3 seconds, no noticeable shutter lag, flash is good for very short range, poor after about 7-10 feet and tends to not illuminate the entire photo, unless subject is very close.Unless you are well schooled in SLR cameras, this will take as close to a perfect photo within a near range of subjects.  If you want to zoom in on a players nose hairs from the balcony of the stadium, this camera will not do it.  If you want to photograph your kids in normal light to dusk at 1-60 feet away.  I don't believe you could improve upon this camera.  I have not used it in bright outdoor light yet, so no opinion there.  Unless you need a stronger zoom or flash, you cannot go wrong with this camera.  It is simple fast and takes near magazine quality photos.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't waste you money!!!", "Author": "Darren O'Hooligan \"Darren O'Hooligan\"", "ReviewID": "RDD55XSXLN7J9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We have a Sony DSC-W100 and after vacationing with some friends decided we need a new camera. The Sony had some REALLY bad shutter lag, therefore causing us to miss shots. After using a friends Kodak, i realized that my 7 year old camera was not cutting it. I spent weeks deciding what P&S; camera to buy. The catch is I didn't want to spend over $200. I have a Nikon DSLR so naturally i looked at Nikons first. I did look at Fuji, Sony, cannon (i know i know) Kodak and Olympus. Not being in the camera market for years, i was amazed at how things have changed so much. I'm accustomed to my SLR and was not willing to give up much. My old Sony has quasi-manual settings, and great control over the camera for a P&S.; After looking at the s4100, i noticed that there was too much shutter lag. I then looked at a cannon, and thought this is the one. For some reason I kept gravitation towards Nikon. Then, I found an absolute steal on the s6100 so decided to go for it. Right out of the box, the Nikon was ready to go (after a full charge of the battery). Downside is there is no physical manual. What am I supposed to read in the bathroom?? This is a very common occurrence with almost all electronics nowadays. Besides, it's good for the environment. Being a \"tech geek\" who needs a manual anyways, isn't that was playing around is for?? My first impression of the camera was very positive. Lightweight, very fast start up time, and ready to go (in daylight). The touchscreen is very easy to use overall use is very intuitive, however might be too much for a first time digital camera user. Picture quality is amazing. DPI at full resolution (why would you do anything else?)is at 200. Compare that to my old sony which was 72 dpi. Higher quality and resolution. There are 3 shooting modes. One is automatic. This mode is pretty self explanatory. Now move to the scene mode shooting. Here's where this camera really shines for me. I took a low light picture in auto mode, then switched to scene mode and selected \" scene auto selector\" The second picture in auto scene selector was MUCH better. I'm not sure which scene it chose but the background as well as foreground were lit properly. Something not achievable on my Sony... EVER. I'm used to being able to light a scene properly with my SLR and external strobe, so I was impressed. Something else that turned me on to the s6100 instead of the s8100 was the static flash. I know it's a minor complaint, but it's less moving pieces for me to worry about. Then theres' the tracking mode. Touch something on the screen (providing it stays still long enough for the camera to lock in) and it tracks the subject. Great for kids moving around! IT has many more features such as blink detect, face recognition and even a touch of the screen shutter mode. Movie mode has a continual focus mode and the ability to zoom in and out, all while recording in 720p HI DEF!! Granted the s8100 does record in full 1080P. I don't use the video mode enough to care to be honest. An to top it all off, it includes a full version of Nikon View NX2 which is a great importing and light editing program. It also includes a file transfer program as well. Absolute seamless integration with windows 7! The size is perfect. Small enough for a pocket, and to be taken anywhere and not be a burden. While still feeling substantial in your hand. 3 weeks later and I still love this camera and it's ability to take great pictures. The only thing i really gave up with the s8100 is 3x more zoom, and full 1080p recording. For the money I paid for the camera I couldn't be happier.Pros: Picture Quality. Ability to take great pictures on low light. 16mp at 200dpi at full resolution. Size. Fast start up. Very little shutter lag if any. Nikon view NX2. Seamless integration with windows 7.  Ease of use.Cons. 7x zoom instead of 10x. only 720p in video mode. No flash compensation for low light situations or zoom.Update: I'm not sure exactly what I was thinking when I wrote this review but after using this camera for a while, this camera ended up being a huge waste of money. This camera took great pictures in daylight, but in low light situations this camera failed miserably. The final draw was a missed picture of my son and his cousins on the back of a fire truck and could not take a picture no matter what I did. Granted it did take some good pictures at times, but after upgrading to a new sony, I really got an idea on how bad this camera really is. so bad in fact that after reading reviews on newer nikon cameras, I will probably never  buy another Nikon P&S.; (this is coming from a die hard nikon SLR user for the past 8 years)", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Touch Screen Needs Improovment", "Author": "SonicOrbStudios \"SonicOrbStudios\"", "ReviewID": "R3BI7C70UEQ5SL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The touch screen is the only thing keeping this camera from being a full 5 star review.

I have been a professional photographer for many years. I used the Nikon F5 for many years and then stepped up to a D700 with a battery pack. The reason I got this is because my rig (camera & all my lenses) is so heavy and cumbersome that I don't carry it around unless I'm going out on a shoot - and I end up missing many shots that I wish I had gotten. So I opted for an inexpensive point & shoot to throw in the car and take with me when I'm going to the store, running other errands or walking the dog.This little thing is just what the doctor ordered!When I fired this puppy up I was amazed! It was.... just plain fun! The focus metering blew me away and the flash was amazing. I was expecting harsh over-blown, too bright images, but what came out were very nicely lit, even exposures.Makes me wonder what the higher end point & shoot models can do. But since I have an excellent higher end Nikon, I felt that would be a waste of money. This camera does exact what I wanted it to do.

This camera requires a couple touch screen interactions to select a mode, which is inconvenient if you want to get a quick shot.

I compared every camera I could find in the $150-$250 price range. I was set on not going over $250, no matter what. After being on the fence between the Sony Cybershot a Kodak touchscreen model, I decided to go with the Nikkon. Short version is this is a wonderful all around camera with very very crisp clear pictures and some nice features.Touchscreen- 8 out of 10. I will note sometimes you need to add a little more pressure than you might add on say a TomTom or other touchscreen device, but nothing too earth shatteringCamera Picture Quality - 9.5 out of 10.

I would say you are NOT going to get any better quality from a camera under $170..Picture Viewer/LCD - 9 out of 10. Clear, no huge delays between photos, sunlight friendly, and very good in terms of resolution..Video 780P - 4 out of 10. Here is where the camera looses hands down.

I did not need this as i have a kodak playful (i bought on amazon as always) which is small, and takes very good resolution videos.

The Coolpix worked wonderfully on our vacation, but the pictures were mostly outside in the daylight.  But I found that when taking pictures indoors, they either came out clear, but with a strong yellow color cast, or normal coloring but fuzzy focus.  I know in many of the situations, the problem could have been easily fixed with a flash, but the camera wouldn't allow it to be turned on.  This was true as I switched between scene and auto modes.  All of that aside, the placement of the buttons on the back side is very unfortunate.  It is way too easy to accidentally press the buttons (causing scene mode changes or switching to video mode when it is not needed).

I've used many DSLR cameras and still use one on a regular basis.I wanted a small, quick point-and-shoot camera to use for fun purposes, like parties, road trips, etc. Something that I could shove in my pocket and take a quick snapshot.Having used a Nikon DSLR for years, I came to expect a lot from the brand. But after playing with this camera, I'm pretty disappointed. The biggest problem I have with it is the touch screen. It is a pressure-sensitive screen, unlike a smartphone or an iPad. You can't gently slide your finger around or tap on icons. You really have to PUSH on the icons to make menus work, and you have to really press and drag to look at your photos. Not only that, if you aren't familiar with a certain icon in the menu, there is no way to read the title without actually pressing it and using that setting. So the only way to find out what these mean (short of memorizing the manual) is trial and error. The camera does come with a stylus that works fairly well, but if you're anything like me, you aren't going to want to have to make sure you have the stylus with you all the time and you wont want to take the time to find the stylus and use it every time you want to use the camera. The whole point (for me) was to have a quick camera. I don't need to waste time playing with a stylus.Another problem I have with this particular camera is the fact that despite \"image stabilization\" you get blurry photos in adequate lighting situations. I turned the flash off because I was in a well-lit room, and the photo still came out blurry. If I were able to adjust the shutter speed, maybe this wouldn't be a big deal. But as far as I can tell, I can't. Even if I could, the menus are so frustrating that I gave up. There are very few words in the menus.

I loved the display, ease of use, and compact size, but I am not impressed with its performance. The camera takes fairly decent photos if your subjects are in good lighting and are perfectly still, but if there is movement of any kind, the pictures often come out with ghost-like blurring. I tried using the action setting to see if that would help with the blurring, but it did not appear to make any difference. Many of our vacation pictures came out blurred, and I missed a lot of photo opportunities because I could not get the camera to focus in time to get the shot IF it focused at all.While waiting for our flight in an airport terminal, our sons were sitting on the floor a short distance across from us as they charged their laptop with a wall outlet that they had found. I tried to capture the moment, but no matter how many pictures I took, I could not get the camera to focus even though I tried different settings, flash vs no flash, and distances with the zoom. I don't know if it was because of the lighting in the terminal or the reflection of the shiny polished floor that they were sitting on that was causing the issue. I had the same problem at a family member's home one morning during breakfast. Most of the family was standing around talking, while other family members moved about. Once again, almost all the photos blurred. I'm pretty certain that the camera was having a hard time focusing because of the lighting in that instance. Another time our kids and their cousins were playing in a family member's front yard. The time of day was perfect; it was early evening with lots of natural indirect light. But every single photo blurred except the ones that I took of people that were standing perfectly still. Some of the photos came out with one person focused, while another right next to them looked ghost-like because they were in motion.

She wanted a nice camera to learn how to start taking digital photos. At first the camera was nice, the photos it took looked good and it worked well, especially for beginner. That changed when she tried to use it around October this year. She had used it a few times, for Christmas, New Years, and a few birthdays, but when she attempted to use it last month (October 2012) the camera wouldn't power on and the battery wouldn't charge. After obtaining a second battery (one from a friend's same model camera) I verified that the battery must be the problem as the friend's battery powered on the camera and charged.I decided to call Nikon as naturally the camera was still under warranty and I was unaware that the battery was excluded from the warranty. Upon calling them I was instructed to send the camera in alone (and pay for shipping out of pocket), without the battery or any accessories (they failed to inform me then that the battery was not included in the warranty). After receiving the camera back, which I was informed was fully functioning (as I already knew), the included paper stated that I should have sent in the battery and charger. The camera, when returned, was badly packaged, the box was damaged and the touch panel covering the screen now has a bubble in it. Upon calling back I was told that the person I had previously spoke to was mis-informed and that I should have sent in the battery and charger along with the camera. Upon asking if I could receive a replacement for what is obviously a bad battery, the representative finally informed me that the battery is not considered an \"accessory\" with the camera and thus it is excluded from the warranty.This exclusion from the warranty makes little sense and I have filed a complaint with Nikon because of it. After speaking with other Nikon point-and-shoot owners, it seems that bad batteries are a fairly common problem and that the batteries should not be trusted to last. Thus, since the original battery failed (and others have experienced the same) it makes little sense to purchase another Nikon branded battery.Overall the camera was a nice one while it was functional, the lack of adequate support on Nikon's part is really horrible and the reason why I gave this camera only one out of five. Be aware, however, that the battery exclusion for the warranty is true for all Nikon cameras (at least that is what I was told by the representative).", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective", "Author": "Ltejeda84", "ReviewID": "R22A203M0FFPMB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My husband bought me this camera for Christmas by the end of February the camera wouldn't charge.

They said repair should take appx 2 weeks so we'll see.........So to recap - yeah the camera is great when it works", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon Lover", "Author": "Liz - Austin TX", "ReviewID": "R2MLIEYCS525T1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am already a Nikon fan so no selling needed.

Even arrived a little ahead of time!", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera -- as long as you read the CD manual (4- stars)", "Author": "Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "ReviewID": "R3KYAV5X4BXSX2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although it looks like a typical point-and-shoot camera, the Coolpix S6100 requires a little more finesse than some to operate at its best.  Sure, it can do automatic point-and-shoot photos, but unless you understand the two-step focusing process, the multiple focusing windows that appear, how to fix the disappearing screen, how the touchscreen works, etc., you may struggle.  The quick start manual that comes with the camera provides little help.  Once I figured out most of the features, however, I came to really like this camera.First, the good:  it takes excellent 16 MP photos, with a 7x optical zoom.  The lens quality is above many competitors'.  You can focus on a specific object or person, or take a quick photo, just by tapping the screen.  The large LCD screen is easy to see, even in fairly bright light, and the on-screen menu displays are readily visible when activated.  I like that I can take a picture with a touch of the screen rather than depressing the shutter button, although I have taken a few accidental pictures this way when handling the camera.  (This feature can be turned off.)  Switching between still pictures and video is easier than on most cameras since there is a specialized button right next to the screen.  Battery life is about average for a Li-On; my husband goes through two sets of AA batteries for his Sony in the number of shots I can take, with more on-time, on the S6100.  If you point the camera into the sun, a red circle appears in the viewfinder to alert you to a potential exposure problem.Next, the bad:  the time to write to the memory card is too slow, even when you select Continuous mode.  The touch screen, while generally responsive, sometimes lacks sensitivity, especially when using the lower tab.  The included stylus, which you can attach to the strap, works much better than a finger.  Autofocus doesn't work if you are using the zoom and have disabled the flash.Last, the neutral:  the included CD that contains PDF versions of the manual in several languages provides ample detail on how to use the camera and its advanced features.  The camera maintains the last settings used from power-on to power-on.  Although the factory settings direct the camera to sleep after 30 seconds of non-use (a real pain, especially if you're sight-seeing!), you can change the length of time to sleep (I use 30 minutes).  Make sure you buy an SDHC memory card since the camera does not come with even a low-capacity card.  It's a little on the bulky side compared to most of today's point-and-shoot compact digital cameras, an inch thick at its widest, but it's still much thinner than my old Canon Stylus.I like this camera despite some of its shortcomings.  On a recent trip, 95 percent of my photos were sharp, with good color reproduction.  The rest were either accidental shots, failed attempts to shoot a moving object, or, in a very few cases, unfocused shots.  That's as good as any digital camera I've owned.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon CoolPix", "Author": "Mary E Ellis", "ReviewID": "R2U8QBNWMYVL3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.

It is now March 2012, and I've had it in my possession for a total of about 2-3 months. The rest of that time, it has been in repairs. I sent it back post Christmas after the lens jammed open. I was instructed to send the camera minus all accessories and battery. When I got it back from them, not only would it not work at all, it had a brand new scratch down the face, about 1/4-1/3 the size. I called the company,explained all this, and requested either a totally new unit, or a full refund; and was told by the supervisor to send it in and be advised of the \"next step.\" Now, the reasonable person in me understands it could just be a faulty unit in an otherwise stellar line, however the costumer in me recognizes that this is seriously unacceptable, reflects badly on their product AND service, and that it is their role to correct this. I expressed to the supervisor that my fear was receiving back the same troublesome unit, AGAIN, THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAD DAMAGED and was told basically to play ball and see how it goes. I also wrote a letter voicing my extreme dissatisfaction and again a request for a new unit to turn this experience around so that I could be able to write a favorable review. I just now have been informed that the problem has been fixed to \"factory standards\" and will be sent back to me. Not only has this camera been defective, it was damaged by their own repair staff. And in the 6 months that I've owned it, I have only been able to use it less than half the time. I let them know how they could repair my confidence, and was utterly dismissed.

I would not recommend it for complete beginners, as it has many features that are customizable, and a beginner might not know what to do with them all.

It does what you tell it to so, learn your way around it before you go to that party or whatever you don't want to miss shots and memories. Practice makes perfect and this is not hard to figure out. The video camera is the most stable and HD res that I have ever had in my hands. Testing around, I took some video of the pets and house. I played it back on HD TV and WOW!! This S6100 is only 720p compared to Nikon S8100 and higher that does 1080p but, I don't mind. Like I said, this is the best res I have owned yet and it is still nothing to frown on. I like pictures but, I'm no photographer. I will be taking a lot more videos and pictures now. The effects are fun too. If you want you phone to be a camera, go for it. If you want a camera for a camera, you might want to really consider this one. 16 mpix is how you say,.. very nice...Recommend using stylus. It's just easier and more precise than your finger.

It was easy to use, had a lot of features, and took good pictures when it worked. Unfortunately we went through three S6100s through initial purchase and replacement and none of them lasted an entire year without a problem.Our first lens cover issue happened two weeks after we purchased.  The original retailer swapped the camera for us.The second time it happened the camera was still under the year warranty and Nikon sent us a new one(after a month long wait for parts that never came to fix the camera we sent in).Finally, just past the 6 month warranty period on the \"repair\" which was actually a replacement, we had another error.  This time with the lens itself, not the cover.  Nikon wanted $120 to fix the problem.  Since the listed price on Amazon as I write this review is $109.00 I obviously won't be doing that.We used the S6100 like you would expect to use any point and shoot.  It lived in my wife's purse or my backpack. We never dropped or abused it.  Apparently it needs to be treated with kid gloves or live in a clean room to keep working. The only comparison I can make from personal experience is a trusty Canon Elph that isn't near the picture quality but has been going strong for 5 years without an issue.  In fact, we gave it to our young children to use and it's withstood all the abuse they can dish out.I won't be buying another Nikon.

So i needed something small and had some good zoom that i could stick in my purse and leave there for use when needed. this camera is perfect for that. i purchase a hard shell camera case for it so it wont get ruined in my purse.

It also allows you to draw on your pictures with the in camera writing tool, which is pretty cool.the only cons that i have about this camera is that it does take a little long for the camera to come off of just taking a picture. the load time is a few seconds..i wish it could be a little faster, i did turn of the picture playback that all cameras have where you can see the picture for a second after you take it, i turned that off so it helped a little, but not to much. its is also a little slow when you push the \"playback\" button to review your pictures, and i found nothing that can help with that, just have a little patience i guess. this reason is the only one i have for giving it a 4 star review, if thy had 4 and a half stars i would give it that because its not to to big a deal.All in all, it is a nice camera and the pictures look real good. im a camera junkie as i have had all different type of cameras, so a camera that takes nice photos is pretty important to me. i would recommend this camera to anyone who wants this to be an ad on camera, something that you can throw in your pocket or purse and just leave it there.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "CJP", "ReviewID": "R3IOMVRKJ5T3TQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an amateur photographer, got this camera for times where its to difficult to carry around a bigger one.

There were many things he liked about is so after looking at the other comparable cameras in this category we decided to buy it.  It is smaller than our Panasonic bridge camera which makes it more convenient for much of our daily picture taking yet we will keep the Panasonic as there are many things it will do this one will not.Picture quality is pretty good from what I can tell.  The photos inside without the flash were better than the ones using the flash in an office setting.  I used it during our office party and it captured good photos even when people are moving.  It will automatically focus in on faces and there has been no red eye challenges, etc.  We have not used the movie mode yet so I canont say how the quality is for that.You cannot ask for a much easier setup and the menuing system is easy to follow.  Use the stylus that comes with it, just hook it on the strap and it will be much easier than using your fingers.  Overall it has nice settings and options.  One real feature it is missing is the number of pictures left based on the card size.  You can get estimates from the web yet I expected it to be on the camera like most of the others.  It is a small thing yet the small things are important sometimes.Overall we will enjoy this camera for much of what we want to capture.  It has a really solid feel compared to some of the others I have looked at.  This is the first Nikon I have had and for the category I believe it was a good purchase at a good price.  It was on sale and I added it to the cart and then went to view some other cameras just to make sure it was the one I wanted.

I was very excited when the camera arrived in the mail. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected. The touch screen was somewhat unresponsive or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, too responsive and would take pictures when I didn't want it to or would go all over the place. However, I will say that the rest of the features that this camera provided were great. Taking a picture (minus the touch screen) was a breeze and the pictures were always vivid and always captured what I wanted it to. However, after about 3-4 days of trying the camera out, I decided I needed to return the camera to Amazon so I could get a better one and I did. I got the Canon Powershot A2200 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom (Black) and it was a better value. It has many of the same features as the camera being reviewed does and some extras while also being less expensive. If you're looking for a good quality camera where you get more bang for your buck then that's the camera I would suggest.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon vs. Canon - and the winner is...", "Author": "Amy Weierman", "ReviewID": "R2J3D0NK9WYG58", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a 5MP Canon Elph (which I've never had a problem with since purchase) that I bought six years ago came with an AC plug-into-the-wall charger for the battery that came with the camera.  This is great for charging extra batteries and doesn't require any additional ridiculous cord.  This Nikon comes with a plug and USB cord that plugs in to the camera to charge the battery.  Inconvenient. This is, however, a great way for Nikon to make extra money on accessories. In addition, as far as I can tell, the USB cord that comes with the Coolpix camera is a proprietary type, not a standard mini- or micro-USB, so you HAVE to have the Nikon cord to charge and sync your pics (if you don't have a card reader), so if you want a spare, be prepared to spend more money here too.  Right now, the battery is still charging, which according to specs, can take 4-6 hours.  So a spare battery that I can charge outside the camera sure would be handy to have...  I'll be sure to purchase off-brand so that Nikon isn't profiting from their tired old marketing scheme.  I'm old and I don't like change but I thought I'd try Nikon again, my first camera was an N2000 which I loved.UPDATE July 24, 2011:  I got this as a gift for a picky family member with arthritis so unboxed it and tried it out a bit. I don't like the touchscreen menus and HATE the touch scrolling to view photos!  In theory, to delete one photo takes four taps, but on a touchscreen that isn't sensitive enough, you may have to tap six or eight times.  I find the photos on the viewfinder look red, but once downloaded the color is fine, and it really does take very nice photos.  The video is OK, but if you're looking for great quality HD video, this is only 720p - I'd suggest finding a 1080p device.  I just don't enjoy using this camera.  Overall, I find I'm taking less photos because I reach for the camera less often, and that that's no good.UPDATE August 14, 2011:  I was taking photos at the birthday party today and after about 20 photos, I suddenly got a \"This card cannot be read\" error on the screen!  Changed out the Transcend Class 10 SDHC 8GB card for the spare I carry, same error.  That ended my photo-taking for the day.  I got home, was thankfully able to load the photos I took onto my laptop, then formatted the cards.  Still no joy.  So I checked the user manual, which tells me that the four 'tested and approved' brands of SD cards are Sandisk, Toshiba, Lexar and Panasonic.  I happen to have a Sandisk SD card for my Canon EOS Rebel XSi (which I've never had a problem with in 3 years).  The card worked fine in the Nikon.  I checked the two Transcend cards in the Canon and they work just dandy.  Verdict:  Canon wins, I'm taking the Nikon back and getting a new Elph!  I wouldn't inflict this type of frustration on an enemy (but maybe an unruly family member...).UPDATE September 29, 2011: We exchanged the Nikon for a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH24.

The camera itself is a 4/5 (IMO).First, The Camera box was covered in a plastic bag with Adorama written all over it. When I received the camera, the box was extremely pretty banged up (it was even punctured). Sure, you could blame the carrier (UPS) for the damage, but I blame Adorama. They could have at least boxed it up to protect it. It IS an electronic after all. Would you want to buy a camera if you saw the box that holds the camera was bent, punctured, or smashed? No. Therefore, I am extremely disappointed on how horrible my product was packaged. Second, The box was opened. When i took the camera out, there was a big fat finger print smudged on the screen. I believe this product is labeled \"New\". It's not new when I get sent an open boxed item. To back up my belief that it's an opened box is because the wrist strap is missing.Now, about the Camera.The material feels pretty weak, I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks if I accidentally sit on it while it's in my back pocket. The touch screen is pretty responsive. It's pressure sensitive, so you do have to press on it, and not just touch it like how the ipod touches are. Think of a Nintendo DS or the old palm phones. That's why it comes with a stylus that attaches to the wrist strap (If only I received one).The Vibration reduction works pretty well, I tried to purposely blur the picture, and it comes out pretty clear. Though, the more you zoom in, the easier it is for the picture to blur, which is normal. Speaking of zoom, you do end up losing a lot of quality when you zoom all the way. The video camera does produce noise in low light situations like indoor house lighting, but it's not terrible. Has a pretty strong flash, it doesn't wash out the pictures at all.Over all, It's a solid camera for the price. If you're on a budget, this Camera is perfect, but you could get MUCH better ones that are about $20 more.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!!
