{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Super snapper!!", "Author": "Nse Ette", "ReviewID": "R3MM3XQP845VMV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Fujifilm faithful ever since my first digicam, the FP1300, seven digital cameras ago in 2001. With the Z10fd, it's easy to see why; tiny, sleek eye catching design (curvy and retro looking), intuitive, easy to use interface, and great image quality.The Z10 is a 7 megapixel camera with 25MB internal memory. I made sure I got a large memory card, a 1GB XD card (the camera also takes SD and SDHC memory cards) which stores 294 images at the highest resolution, and 18.7 minute movie clips (640x480 at 30fps).Having owned two cameras in the Z series; the Z1 and Z3, comparisons are inevitable. The first thing of note is that you no longer require the cradle to charge the camera, or download photos/movies/sound clips. It was quite a pain having to lug that around everywhere.As with those two, the camera powers on by sliding back the lens cover. One gripe I have though is that there isn't a dedicated button for movie mode anymore. You must now go into the menu to access it, but I can live with that. There's only one button on top of the camera, the shutter button, everything else in located on the back, beside the LCD.The 2.5 inch LCD display is toughened and scratch/break resistant. The resolution is excellent. The camera has 3x optical zoom which it does without extending out of the camera body, like most other cameras.The battery charges in about an hour, much quicker than the 140 minutes stated in the manual. Camera start up is very quick too, just under 2 seconds from my timing.The menu is even further simplified. If, for example, you select one out of the 18 shooting modes (i.e. Manual, Auto, Natural & Flash, Natural light, Party, Sports -for moving objects, etc. There's even a mode for Text), the screen displays text explaining what each mode is, with crystal clear sample images to illustrate. Each mode makes life easier for people like me who aren't into much tinkering to achieve great results. Natural & Flash is one of my favourites as it takes two images; one with flash, and one with natural light near simultaneously, and you get to select one, or keep both. Most times, the photo taken in natural light comes out tops.Movies are shot in 30fps, TV quality mode, which is becoming standard in digicams these days. You can select either the higher quality of 640x480, or lower quality of 320x240 (which gives longer clips). Quality is very good, and it's amazing the way the camera adapts to changes in light intensity while shooting (e.g. moving from a darker indoors atmosphere to a sunny exterior).Then we come to the major feature, face detection mode. This is a welcome feature for people like me who while handing my camera to strangers to \"please take a photo of me\", hope and pray that the photo taken manages to come out focused and okay at least. In this mode, the camera locks onto facial features, up to ten faces at a time, and automatically selects the best exposure for the shot as well as eliminates red-eye, enabling great shots to be taken every time. You can also use face detection mode with the self timer, ensuring those shots you take of yourself come out great. You can still use AF/AE lock as well.You can edit photos too; clip, rotate, and even send or receive images with other IR enabled cameras by infra red. I tried it with my PC (which is IR enabled) and it didn't work though, shame!The camera comes in a range of colours; black (my favourite), red, green, pink, blue, and orange.There's an AV cable to connect to your TV to view images or movie clips (it uses the same port as the USB and has a nice little cover for the port), and as ever, the Finepix software is first class. Photos up to A3 size can be printed in crystal clear resolution.This camera will not please those who are used to extensive manual settings and loads of tinkering with ISO levels, white balance, and other photographic jargon, but if you're like me, and just want to be able to whip out your camera, and without much fuss, capture the moment, this camera is for you. My current favourite gadget along with my iPod classic!", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Poor low-light performance in an otherwise great camera", "Author": "Dave Nat \"dave_nat\"", "ReviewID": "R4XKRDMCYBSAJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like the camera, but it failed woefully for my needs. The low-light performance is very poor, with significant noise present in any shots over ISO 200. Most small cameras have trouble in low-light, but after the success of the Fuji F20/F30/F40 series, I was hoping this camera would perform better. As it is, the Sony T-Series even though not great in low light, is worlds better. If you want to take indoor shots without flash, that's very important.Almost everything else about this camera is very good:-Nice construction-Easy to use-Good feature set-Good image quality in brightly lit environments-Nice \"grid\" option in viewfinderOne other issue - the \"anti-shake\" does not work very well, it is not true mechanical image stabilization, but rather a shutter-speed and iso boost.So, if you shoot only in bright environments, go for it. Otherwise, look further!", "Date": "October 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "A cool camera for a cool price.", "Author": "Steve Wilson \"dewtwinkle\"", "ReviewID": "R2CHKGYGTWIIUD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Buy this camera because it is tiny, looks cool, and you think the price is low enough not to be bothered if you tire of the image quality.The first thing to be aware of is that when the camera is set to Auto mode, flash pictures are taken at ISO 800 and look very grainy.  In any mode other than Manual, the ISO is set to Auto ISO and you will see plenty of grain if the ISO is higher than 100, which is almost always the case.  To get the best image out of this camera you need to set it to Manual and set the ISO to 64.  The downside to this is that you will then need to hold the camera very steady or use a tripod to avoid blur, which totally negates the reason for buying such a camera in the first place.  Alternatively, you can use noise reducing software such as NoiseNinja and get quite decent results from ISO 200 or 400 images.Barrel distortion from the lens at wide angle is extreme.I doubt that most people would really notice the image quality issues in a 4x6 print.  It's a fine camera if you suddenly want to take a snapshot of people somewhere and post it on the internet.  Everyone you are taking a picture of will think the camera looks cool and they'll probably tell you the picture is great, too!Functionally, the camera works quite well and there's very little lag between pressing the \"shutter\" button and taking the picture.  It is a decent camera for the price.", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "fun camera, worth the money", "Author": "Alicia Meyers", "ReviewID": "R1KG6RR1HOIZ30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the camera is fun.  It takes decent pictures.  It has lots of features.  What it will not do is allow you to zoom in while taking video.  The camera works well for a camera but it's only okay as a video maker.Don't let other venders try to convince you to purchase an extended battery.  I tried to order this camera from 2 other websites that had it for a cheaper price.  I got an e-mail soon after I placed my order saying to call them persoanlly.  I called them because I was told that it was for my own security against fraud.  I was soon told that I should buy an extended battery because \"this camera came with a battery that would only last 20 minutes\".  When I refused the battery my order became cancelled.  After argueing with these poeople for about a week (& in 1 case told my camera wouldn't arrive for a month) I ordered it from Amazon.  I got the camera in about 3 days.  The battery is fine.  I had to charge once after about a week of normal use.I recommend this camera.

If you are going for a sub compact camera then size should be your biggest consideration. This little Z series is about as small as they come. I got mine in Sunset Orange and love the bright color. I mean its so small you could almost put it on your keychain. I have a Razor cell phone and this little camera is slightly thicker, slightly shorter and ever so slightly wider.The weight is about the same, I can actually put it in the Razor's leather case and snap it shut!  The picture quality I am sure will continue to get better in the future but its pretty good now. Those who are reviewing this camera, remember its the size of a cell phone and it still delivers pretty nice pictures. The design does not allow it to be quite as good as the larger cameras. I mean the Canon SD1000 ELF series is the best in this category, and it is more expensive, considerably larger and the lens has to come out when trying to zoom. I was thinking of a camera I could slip into a cell phone case to carry with me just like my phone. I think I've found it here. The whole reason in my mind for a camera this small is portability. Thats means alot to me in that I will always have it on me and no more of this \" if I had only had a camera with me \" thoughts. The best pictures always come when we are not expecting them. I will no longer miss those shots. There are several really cool features on this little camera, one of which is really great macro shots, even has a text mode for taking pictures of script like all the spy movies used to have for photograghing secret documents. please be very careful to read the full description as I have only discussed the reason I feel this camera should be considered, SIZE.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fuji Z10fd Has the Wow Factor !", "Author": "Elizabeth V.

My usage may very from yours, but what I use it for and what you may use it for are probably not that far off. I use this camera a lot to take pictures of small items like action figures and small detail objects for my Amazon reviews. I rarely use it for taking pictures outside or during life events as my cellphone does a good job with that.For fine detail pics and small object photos I need a camera that can focus well, resist shaking, and capture the very fine aspects of the object I'm photographing. This camera does a good job in achieving this need. With a built in anti-shake feature and an impressive zoom ability this little guy is capable of capturing very fine details.The only set back I have found is that the camera has some difficulty with low-light-level situations. With the flash off the camera can blur an image if not enough light is reflecting off the object being photoed. With the flash enabled an object that is being photoed closely by the camera can be overwhelmed by the bright light of the flash. If the object is farther back from the flash the object comes out okay, but the surrounding environment is dark do to the narrow coverage of the flash.Video presentation contains some pics of things I have photoed for reviews.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "overpriced", "Author": "chella", "ReviewID": "R2SO7GONR871LS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this product when I was back in high school, at least 4 years ago.

It's worthy to note, I am not an expert when it comes to photography either. So now, obviously, I am shopping around for a new camera. I used to have this: Fujifilm Finepix V10 5.1MP Digital Camera with 3.4x Optical Zoom (Orange) & I LOVED it. It was by far the best camera I have ever owned. When I purchased it, it was on sale for a little over $100, what a steal! Unfortunately, a friend dropped it, & it broke. By this time, the promotion was over & she wanted to replace it. Not wanting her to have to spend more than I originally had, we saw this Z for around the same price my original was. I thought because I loved my other finepix so much, that this would be a solid replacement, as I had developed trust in the name. Wrong.First, what is with this hiked price? I purchased this cam over 2 yrs ago for around $100 & now it's basically $200? Don't do it.Why? Well, the first finepix I had was just perfect in every way for a casual user. The orange was great, it really stood out, people always asked about it, was easy to find in a bag. It had a rechargeable battery, so you just plugged the cam in & voila, charging!... no extra attachments, no removing batteries, replacing, etc.There was little to no delay when taking photos, so easy to use. The buttons were conveniently placed, so no thumbs in the pics. The pictures were really crisp & clear. It was a well made sturdy cam, (however, you wouldn't think so, given mine broke haha). But the construction was so much better, than the Z, which feels more flimsy.With this Z, it just doesn't compare. When you turn it on, by sliding the front, of course you have a brief waiting period for it to load. THEN you may find yourself & your subjects holding your/their 'poses', for what seems an eternity, when you just want a quick, catch the moment, kind of shot. After you finally get your shot, chances are it will be blurry, or people having moved awkwardly, due to the wait/delay, so then, you have to take more. You will find yourself holding the button halfway, to fullway, just sort of bending to the camera's will, not vice versa. It is a fickle camera. The only time a delay would be nice, would be if you want to 'time' a shot, maybe something of a portrait nature. But for vacationing, random shots, this cam is a pain. It sort of shudders, acting as if it is going to take the pic, then it will stall, confusing the person attempting to take the pic, like 'what is wrong with this thing? is this normal?' side glance to me, leaving me just kind of shrugging, as if to say, 'yes, it is typical & a pain, please be patient.'I think the first finepix I had must have spoiled me, to read all of the glowing reviews on this cam. While I am not crazy about this cam, & would not recommend it, as there ARE better point & shoots out there for equal value or less, it is still better than a cheap kodak or something along that range.I probably should mention the video, it's ok, the sound ok, but again, just ok.I say if you are wanting a 3x (but why? upgrade now to 5x) & are willing to shell out $200, get the V10. Everything about it is better, & they are basically the same size. The V10 is constructed better, easier to use, little to no delay, nice video, no extra pieces to lug around & just overall > (greater than) the Z.BTW- When I say easier to use, it's like comparing a website that is easier to navigate, versus a website that is all clutter & annoying. Yet a cluttered annoying website, would be better than no website or a website using ancient script & cheap design.So, that's it, hope it wasn't too painful to read. This cam = 3 stars, wavering in the middle, it isn't the best, it isn't the worst, so keep looking, you can get better for the current price.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great intro camera, but has it's flaws", "Author": "Raine T", "ReviewID": "R1C57PSY9A17M7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera a little over two years ago, and promptly lost the manual. I actually picked it because of the beautiful pink color it came in. I knew nothing about photography, so I just used the auto and other preset settings until about a week ago. I'll start with prior to using the manual shoot function.The construction of this camera is impressive. I'm a clutz, to say the least. I've dropped it a few times, both on carpet and hard flooring. It's had things spilled on it, and traveled all over. Aside from a few scatches near the function wheels and a weird scratch/smudge on the display, it's fine.Portability is fabulous! I take this camera literally everywhere I go, it's always in my purse. It's less than an inch thick, and 3-4 inces long. The battery lasts a considerable amount of time, and charges fast.Video quality is ok. It's not the best, but it's better than nothing for sure. I have taken videos at concerts that did not turn out well, one at Disneyland that turned out great, and a few of my dog that are great as well. The sound is very good. They take a very long time to upload onto my computer though. Also, if you shoot them holding the camera sideways, the video will remain sideways once you upload it. I haven't found a way to turn them the right way yet.Pictures...have been hit and miss. Sometimes I can get very good images, some VERY poor. The worst are in low lighting or at night, especially outdoors. I've tried using the \"night\" function, which results in streaky, odd looking photos EVERY SINGLE time. Not worth using. Another problem has been the zoom. Sometimes I can zoom in and get clear pictures, other times you can hardly tell what it's a picture of. If you use the \"sport\" setting, that works fairly well for anything that's moving, though they still don't come out perfect.The preset settings are cool. It has auto, snow, beach, sports, flower, natural, auction mode, portrait, landscape, sunset, museum, party, text, and anti-blur. They all have very clear descriptions displayed when you scroll onto them. I wish there were more, though.NOW, i've finally started learning some things, and messing around with the manual settings. I've been getting pictures of a MUCH higher quality, and more consistent. I wish I had learned to do this earlier. I have not tried this yet at night though, so don't know if that can be improved or not. I do still plan on upgrading to the FinePix F70EXR soon, but am happier with this one in the meantime. I would recommend this camera for someone that wants to learn but doesn't feel ready to jump into a DSLR or spend a lot of money.

The pictures look okay on the camera, but when uploaded to a bigger monitor, there is so much pixelation it's incredible.

Blacks look blue/purple. Even outdoors the pictures come out pixelated and noisy, even at the lowest ISO settings in bright daylight. It just doesn't get any worse than that when it comes to cameras. I shipped it back the very next day I got it.
