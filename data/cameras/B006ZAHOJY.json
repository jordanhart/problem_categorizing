I took pictures in the water, under the water, around the water...even let the kids take pictures of each other in their tubes. All my pictures turned out great, even in the shade and inside the house (once I figured out how to use the various settings).I made sure to rinse the camera in clean tap water and dry it off with a towel after we got back from the water everyday to make sure river gunk didn't mess with any of the seals.I also love that the camera uses a charger instead of batteries. Batteries never seem to last long in a digital camera.Since that vacation, I have taken the camera to our friend's backyard pool and to the waterpark. It has preformed beautifully each time and remains waterproof. I would definitely recommend a float strap for use with this camera. There were a few times in the river when we were tossing the camera to each other and missed (It was either let the camera fall or spill beer!) and the float strap saved the camera from getting lost in the river.I have posted a few of the pics I tool on vacation so you can see some examples of what the camera is capable of...just keep in mind that I'm not a professional photographer! :)", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "The only way to go", "Author": "Ben Cornelius", "ReviewID": "R2HYT6H1RORM4W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Up front, I'm a professional photographer with other very nice cameras.  I had considered more expensive options...larger aperture, cmos, whatever, but am glad that I saved the money and went with this one.  If you want all that performance stuff, just get a dslr and call it a day.  These weather/impact resistant cameras are the only way to go with point and shoots.  I've ruined a couple others with only the slightest usage...a complete waste of money.  Also, who wants to dangle a $300+ camera over the edge of a kayak, or freak out about every grain of sand on vacation.  Since this doesnt' have a retractable lens, it's MUCH less prone to problems that inevitably kill other fragile models.  Compact with a very usable zoom range.I just got back from a trip up the Oregon coast: kayaking, swimming on the beach, hiking, and SO many times I congratulated myself for the wise purchase (leaving the other cameras at home and bringing this tough little guy).  I still got some very cool shots.  The quality of the image was better than I had expected.  By the way, I LOVE LOVE the panorama feature.  It took a sec to figure out how to use it properly, but once I did, I got some stunning images.  They look like fish eye shots cropped to ultra wide screen.  Very cool little camera at a fair price.  I have every reason to believe this one will last.  Only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is because no camera is perfect.  They're all a compromise in some way.  For getting out there and getting some cool shots to remember, all without being up tight about your gear all the time, this is perfect.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok Camera with a major flaw - proprietary USB cable", "Author": "ThatGuy", "ReviewID": "R19G4TDS73GVM3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Enough has been written in other reviews on the performance of this camera. However, no one seemed to notice a flaw that to me is not acceptable anymore and customers should not put up with this.The camera uses some type of proprietary USB cable. I ma perfectly happy taking one full size USB and one micro USB cable on my travels. I have a number of each, I keep one set in my travel suitcase, one set in my office, one set in my car. I have always a set connected to my computer both at the office and home office. This make life much easier.However, Olympus has decided that making life easy for customers is the wrong way to go and the USB cable, even though it is pretty much the size or regular USB it is nothing but a regular USB. Worse, the camera does not come with a battery charger. To charge the camera you have to use this cable. Adding the very poor battery life means that you will be searching for this cable a lot. And if you forget to take it with you on a trip, you will be screwed completely. And this, my friends, upsets me very much.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Camera for the price.....", "Author": "Maintyper", "ReviewID": "R1V4G6TTF08EVB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for an upcoming trip to Legoland Ca. where my kids would probably spend most of their time at the waterpark area. So for fun I thought it would be nice to get a waterproof camera.I am not a camera expert by any means, I currently own a Sony HX5V which is my primary Camera and without a doubt the best one I have ever owned.The Olympus is a good product, and the pictures came out a lot better than I was expecting. They were clear and impressive. The video was pretty good too. I have not had the time to try all the setting, or my pic's and video might have come out better.Was it waterproof? Yes, it was. I had to recharge it several times during our trip and not once did it fail. I have also used it at our local waterpark since then and it is holding up fine. One issue it to be extra, extra careful not to get anything on the glass lense or water droplets will stick to it, causing some pictures to come out bad. I really enjoyed not having to worry being splashed or having the camera fall under the water. Once out of the water, the HX5V did the job.... :)I did take some shots underwater and they came out fine, in fact a few of them were really good. Got to get my kids to be able to hold their breath longer though so there is more time for the bubbles to float away, but they are only 4 and 6 so it will take time. I am sure as I get used to it, I will learn how to use the various settings better to enhance my picture taking experience.My only complaint and I know I am not the first to mention it is the battery life. I am used to getting 250+ shots and video out of the Sony with no issues (and many of the videos are well over 5min). This camera probably gets slightly above 90 day shots before the camera starts to die (and what few videos I took were all under 4min ea.)I will post a couple of the pictures I took with this camera when I get time.Would I buy this camera again? I would, it is a good camera for the price,and my family spends a lot of time in the water, just make sure to have another camera handy for all land shots, becuase you have to soak it 10 minutes in tap water, let it dry out before you can even begin to charge it. So there is not really a reason to buy a second battery since you cannot change it when necessary. Probably why many people have trouble with the waterproof failures.I hope this review was helpful. Sorry I do not have a lot of technical stuff to compare and review.UPDATE: 6/16/2013The Camera is still doing great. I have taken great care to follow the instructions and we have not had any leaks. This camera is still waterproof. Although now I must admit that I have gotten a lot more confident and will be purchasing a spare battery to make up for the short lifespan. With summer upon us, I have been playing around by drying the camera with my beach towel, giving it about 5min in the sun, and would open and close the carmera. NO ISSUES! I am sure I can change the battery without worry. I would not attempt if we were at the beach or someplace that something could get lodged in it.Anyway, the camera is still a great deal for the price. :)", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not waterproof!", "Author": "Sage Lady", "ReviewID": "R1UO186MLHQAWT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for snorkeling in St John. I was meticulous about following instructions and rinsing in clear water etc. It failed on the 3rd day! Water had seeped into the battery compartment! Very disappointing purchase!

I wanted it for a boat ride and for when I'm at the pool. I didn't use this for diving or anything other than walking in the water to and from the boat and while on the boat. I walked in water waist high and of course the camera fell below the water line at some points, but I never left it submerged for more than a minute. What I absolutely love is the image stabilization. I was on a small boat with a lot of vibration and all my photos came out crystal clear. I was nicely surprised and that in itself was worth the money for this camera. What I didn't like is the zoom. It will not zoom at a soft touch of the T. I had to push the button harder than a normal camera, and this is probably just because it's encased in rubber. You'll have to remember to push harder on that feature or lose some shots, which I did. But now I know to use a little more force than normal. The zoom isn't that great, but isn't just terrible either. It met my expectations for what I wanted. The zoom is internal because it's waterproof, so remember to get closer to your subjects with this camera. I put it under the water for 2 shots just to see how the camera would hold up. No water on the lens that I can tell, when I took the memory card out, there was just a drop of water on the card, nothing major and like I said, for what I want, I can live with that. I'm not gonna be taking it under water for any length of time, just walking to and from the boat and splashing around in the pool. It will definitely hold up to that. I don't how this will do in dim lighting, as I only want it for day use, but I did take some practice shots in dim lighting and I wasn't impressed with them. But that could just be the screen on the camera because my day shots looked way better on my computer monitor than they did on the camera. The buttons are kind of small, but there aren't too many that you won't be able to figure it out if you ever picked up any camera before. You can pick your own settings for this camera, which is a bonus since I've seen some waterproof cameras look like kids cameras. However, I just used \"auto\" and it did automatically pick bright sun as the setting. Over all, I'm very happy with this camera.Wanted to add that after this initial review I used the camera in the pool. And I mean I really used it. Under the waterfall, in the fountain, under water, everything. And it worked beautifully. Not even a drop of water on the memory card as I mentioned when I used it on the boat. Maybe I didn't have it snapped shut completely the first time. As I mentioned, the image stabilization is wonderful. Pictures came out perfectly. I noticed a reviewer was upset about the charging cable, but to me that is a plus. Just plug it in and let it charge. But if that is bothering you, I got a wall charger for the battery here on Amazon for $12.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Waterproof!", "Author": "BillB138", "ReviewID": "R2JKNDHU8YDU8I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for a vacation in Tahiti, and it worked great and took very nice pictures until I tried to take it snorkelling (which of course was the point of getting this camera).  After 10 minutes in no deeper than 3 feet of water, the camera leaked and the electronics inside were destroyed.  I had checked before going in the water that the battery door was closed and locked, so it was definitely a product issue and not user error.

Smith", "ReviewID": "RY0CB9BVARKED", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I rarely write reviews, but this camera simply does not live up to its performance claims, and potential buyers need to know of my experience.  I bought a TG-320 on Amazon for a white water rafting trip down the Grand Canyon, and shot dozens of outdoor action pictures with it.  Once I got home I was quite dismayed that the image color and quality was noticably lacking in comparision to photos taken by my Olympus VR-330 14MP camera (used as a backup for less risky/wet shots, which utilizes the same battery).  While it handled the splashes of the Colorado River well, it later failed after using it to record my grandkids frolicking in a swimming pool.  After brief submersions of around two feet, I took it home to find moisture droplets on the SD card and in the battery chamber.  I left the battery door open to dry out, and all was well; but clearly this camera can never be used for its intended purpose again.  I have always been very careful to keep the battery door gasket clean and double locked, but apparently to no avail.

The camera works great, and I have had no problems with water.  I have taken mine on many wet hikes, and my sister has taken pictures while swimming in a pool.  However, both cameras ruin the pictures taken on them.  Lines and discolorations mar the pictures, or black areas will cover half the picture.  At first, I thought it was just my camera, and I assumed it was my own fault; I have always been rough on electronics:  leaving it in the car on a hot summer day, leaving it in a wet backpack, dropping it, etc.  My sister is the opposite.

Aside from the horrible battery that let us down early on our first day of capturing the kids first surf lesson, the lack of water integrity failed us on the snorkeling trip the next day.  Max depth the camera experienced was about 3 feet.  Took 5 pictures and then died.  No more.  Got home and see that there is significant moisture on the inside of the back screen.  Really hoping Sears will take this thing back.I do not recommend this camera to anyone looking for a waterproof feature.  If however you are looking for a way to waste some money and time, this camera may be just for you. I was with a friend who has the TG-1.  Sure it is more than twice the cost, but crazy thing is that it is waterproof (like advertised).  It also happens to take really good pictures, really good!!!.

We also had a Fuji like this and I have to say this a bit better and cheaper. I do photography for a living and to be honest have no real use for a point and shoot camera, I bought this for my wife. And I actually like the picture quality you can get from it if you know what your doing. The controls and menu navigation are very simple, has some fun features like 3D photos etc. and the video is pretty good for doing little clips of the kids and what not. We have a lot of kids and they have managed to break all her other cameras so far, with it being water and shock resistant I fell like this would be a good choice for some one who has kids around that may get a hold of the camera. And now that I am thinking about it even if you are a serious photographer and you don't feel like taking your DSLR into say a kayak or out in the rain you can get some pretty decent shots.

My camera is relatively new, and when received it, my initial thoughts were that the battery cover seemed really flimsy and it honestly didn't look like it would protect the camera. I decided to test it out in the bathroom sink, and noticed a few tiny water droplets on the battery. Even with this, I thought it was really minor and just thought to be extra careful ( I only needed it to work for one underwater trip, after that I will just use it as a normal camera). I recently took it on a trip to the Bahamas and decided I would be extra careful and not keep it submerged for too long whilst snorkelling. That didn't help at all. The screen stopped working completely and now the orange light that tells you when its switched on, keeps flickering. Apart from this major design fault, it does take very good quality photos.The pictures I managed to take underwater before it broke are very good, I even took an underwater video and it was crystal clear quality. If you want a good resilient camera for your travels then i suggest buying this camera, but DO NOT buy it for underwater trips. The olympus series has other good quality underwater cameras, although they are much pricier, at least they will function properly. On the trip I went on, most people's underwater cameras broke, so I guess you really have to invest in a good quality camera if you don't want it to break.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera IS NOT WATERPROOF", "Author": "Candace Cook", "ReviewID": "R23X8DBD1CPTO8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned two of these cameras and each one has been destroyed by water seeping into the internal compartment. It has been such a disappointment on both occasions as I was on vacation and left without a camera for the remainder of it.

Schultz", "ReviewID": "R9SLL0QBX2624", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this for a snorkeling trip, but I was curious about the negative reviews that said it performed poorly out of the water.  I think it does a pretty good job for the price.  I've added some \"customer images\" to the product page from a trip to the zoo, as well as a couple macro test shots.Nearly all the zoo photos were taken at maximum zoom, which is limited on this camera due to the waterproof, internal lens design.  I also cropped each photo - a lot, in some cases - so that details might be seen better (The red panda example includes the uncropped original).  I deducted a whole star off of my rating for poor battery life, though.  Although it never went dead, the battery light started flashing at me after just 30 photos and 10 minutes of video over a 3-hour period.I think the photos in full sunlight are just fine.  In full sun, it even took a reasonably sharp picture through a chain link fence, where many cameras would have autofocused on the fence rather than the subject.Fur, feathers and whiskers are not quite as sharp in shade or partial shade.  Because of the combination of shade and the maximum zoom used, the shutter speeds for the shade photos were all less than 1/100th of a second, most around 1/60 or 1/80.  So camera shake, not the camera, is likely responsible for some of the slight blurriness on those (red panda example).  This will probably limit underwater photos to sunny days and/or flash.You could certainly get better quality by using a tripod, or buying a more expensive camera with a brighter lens.  Also, if you don't need a waterproof camera, a camera in the same price range with an external external focus lens should get you some improvement.  However, my experience in this price range is that they're all about the same, and quality problems are often due to operator error... camera shake and incorrect focus or exposure settings.April 7, 2013.  Returned from Akumal, MX and I was generally pleased with the underwater results.  I took it to a maximum depth of about 5 feet and it remained waterproof.  However, because of the way the access door is designed, I could see how someone might get water into the camera when they open the door to charge or remove the SD card.  Use caution and common sense.Underwater video and image problems I experienced were mostly operator error... image blur, poorly focused, or jerky video. HOWEVER, the \"underwater\" white balance setting (good luck finding it) randomly results in photos that are very heavily red-saturated. Even with that flaw - for the price - I would have happily given it a +4-star rating if the battery life were longer.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fun camera", "Author": "Marcos Valls-Martin", "ReviewID": "R6K4WS1AVR2IF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fun camera to use under water and with kids (shock proof).The quality of the pictures could be better.

The photo quality is good, I'm no expert, but I took several photos of a fish my friend was reeling in with the camera underwater and they turned out great, even though the fish was thrashing about. It's a great camera for the price. I wouldn't go scuba diving with it, but if you're just taking photos under the surface of the water, it's plenty good.

I assume this would eliminate the ability to bring it into the water, as it was no longer sealed.  It was flimsy, at best.The next break was the LCD screen.  I had the camera in my pocket for about 15 minutes and when I pulled it out the screen on the back was damaged and broken to the point where it doesn't register pictures.  The camera suffered no shock nor pressure, I literally walked from one side of the mall to the other, so I have no idea what happened.

When it finally began to go wonky, I knew I wanted another Olympus.  The Tough series had been the 'newest greatest' thing when I'd gotten my Olympus, and had been more expensive than I'd been willing to spend.  Since then, the price has dropped substantually so I went in for it.  It is very intuative, easy to use, and does not have the sliding shutter that sometimes got clogged a little during mudruns. The quality of video is definitely improved from the Stylus, and we are very amused by not one, but TWO \"pet modes\" where apparently it will automatically take a picture if it detects a cat or dog face.  I'm not sure I'll ever need that, but if you want a worthy rugged little point and shoot to go on all your adventures with at a reasonable price, this is it.

It took great photos on sunny days and under water with the reefs and pool/beach.I had no issues with water leakage in the battery compartment like other have had. The camera was fine while i was running it in about 2-3 feet of water, and i'd always try to keep it above water if I could just in case.
