Nothing compares with that, however this is the closest to that quality that I have ever found in a small camera. I recommend it to any friend that cannot afford the amount of money I have spent in photography. You sill get so much for so little and I have two of these. I have one for work and one for play with my three kids. I have 38 employees and have  been in business as the owner of Duren Roofing Inc. here in South Florida for just over 15 years since I started my company from scratch, so I know quality when I see it and this camera has it and for a great price for what you get.  Enjoy it. :)", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.00", "Features": "Alpha SLT-A58K 20.1 MP Digital SLR Kit w/ 18-55mm Lens\n32 GB SDHC Memory Card - Class 10, Compact Deluxe Gadget Bag - DC74\nInfoLithium H Series NP-FM500 Camera battery, 55mm UV, Polarizer & FLD Deluxe Filter kit\nHi-Speed SD USB 2.0 Card Reader, High Speed micro-HDMI to HDMI A/V Cable 6 Feet\nScreen Protectors for LCD's (pack of 3), Dust Blower, 3pc.
