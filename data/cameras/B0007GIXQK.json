There were no real reviews available because it just became available in the US the end of March.  I am replacing a Finepix A310 which for the price was a decent point and shoot but was damaged beyond repair in an accident.For features and picture quality I believe the price is hard to beat.  After experimenting for a week, I have found the photos to be excellent both in doors and out doors with various modes available such as portrait, landscape and even a night mode.  The one thing that plagued other cameras in this class was underpowered flash..the flash is more than adequate for a camera of this size and I am extremely pleased with the results.It is smaller but more solid than my previous finepix and very intuitive controls and miserly on battery usage while most others are simply battery hogs.  It even does video with amazing good quality however the sound is monoraul and leaves something to be desired.If you need a point and shoot with some manual adjustments available, good battery usage, compact and occasional video then this is the camera for you.  Again..proof is in the photos themselves.  Oh..this thing powers up ready to shoot amazingly quick...Enjoy..you can't go wrong with this one..latest technology and usually can be found up to 30% off its list price.", "Date": "April 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "The Best of them ALL!", "Author": "Marsha L. Mcginnis \"Marsha\"", "ReviewID": "R2RG6VKEVIOH82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as an upgrade to a three-year old Finepix 2600Z that I noticed was slow compared to the newer ones. The pics were still excellent - so I figured I'd stay with Fugi. Since purchasing the A350, I've become increasingly interested in taking more professional \"LOOKING\" photos. So, I've tried the Nikon Coolpix 7600, the Cannon SD500, the new Cannon Power Shot S2 IS, the Cannon PS A10, and the Finepix F10. (Sending three of the above mentioned back). And, I keep coming back to this little no-nonsense, non fidley, point and shoot wonder. It is the easiest and the best of them all.At first some pics were blurred, until I learned the secret of standing against something to brace myself, holding my breath as I shot the photo, and just using the focus feature like it says in the manual. And behold! Great pictures! I'm a big fan of natural light, and shoot most of my pictures without a flash, and try and fill the frame. That's what works for me anyway. Some people love to \"set up\" the shot, and that's fine - but I've learned that's not for me, I don't have time to fiddle - espicially when it's catching children in unaffected and natural states of being. I love spontaneous shots. And with this camera, those are within my reach.It looks as nice as the \"upper end\" purse/pocket sized Cannons, (same size - but a tad thicker), it's much less complicated to use, and the price is unbelievably reasonable. Everyone should have one - even if it's just to have as a back up. You'll find yourself using it more than the one it's backing up. :)", "Date": "September 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera,= terrific pictures", "Author": "Leon Photo", "ReviewID": "R2B3PASN04MPDH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my seventh Finepix..A205 A210 A330 A340 A345 and A350  in addition to Finepix s602.

When I move up to the next model camera, I usually give the older model to my niece, nephew, or granddaughter. Many of my former students aremaking great photos with various digital cameras because theyare: Holding the camera steady, pressing the shutter releasehalfway so the camera focusses and sets the exposure.

Unlike a reviewer below, I took some time with it before writing this review. I also don't care what the camera looks like. Sure, its small and sleek, but I prefer that over big and chunky....Anyway, I have had a generally good experience in the 60 -70 pics I have taken with it. One thing I really like is the menu system is very intuitive. I didn't read the manual at first, just started messing with it, and I was able to take good quality pictures, and figure out the movie mode. It has a simple menu system for those that don't like reading the manual. (read the manual anyway, there's good stuff in there) Another feature I like is the macro mode. I took some VERY close shots of my pets and various car parts and they all turned out excellent. Flash has worked well. Not perfect though, as I've occasionally had to take the pic again when the pic showed too dark. I picked up the 1GB memory card for more memory, as the 16MB card it comes with will only take about 20 pics at the best quality. 1GB will let you take a little over 700.My only complaint is the LCD is a little dark and slightly fuzzy. The pics turn out much better than the LCD screen shows, but you sometimes can't tell in preview mode if the pic you just took was great or kinda crappy.....Overall, I'm happy with it, and my wife got it for a good price. If you're looking for a no fuss, easy to use camera, find this one on sale and you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "January 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "FujiFilm Finepix A350 5.2Mp Review", "Author": "Ashkan", "ReviewID": "R1T3B8JPVA4RBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's an outstanding Digital Camera . its size is small to compare other Digital Cameras but its features and options are so vast , it doesn't have many functional bottons or arrow keys on the body of the Camera but it has many features ,options and camera control Functions through Menus appearing on the LCD , you can scroll , move , select and manage the menus on the LCD by the Simple Arrow Keys and bottons implemented on the body of the camera .

We are happy that we now have a small camera that you can take to any function by clipping on your belt, putting in your purse, or in my fly fishing chest pack--just in case... We have taken most photos on 3 MP, and find that they look excellent on 4 x 6 format.  Haven't done any enlargements yet.  We have another Finepix camera we use when we plan to get 8 x 10s or larger, anyway.  Sticking with the same brand makes it easier to learn how to use the camera, as the logic is similar.  We like that it uses AA batteries.  Based on our past experience with rechargeables (negative), we just use off the shelf throw-away (oops, recyclable) AA alkaline batteries.  Since they can be obtained cheaply and the charge does not diminish when you take them on a trip.", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great little camera.", "Author": "John Ml.", "ReviewID": "R3MKMR8WREH9UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is tiny and gives great pictures and all features you would find on these camera size.

The pictures are blurry far more often than not, even when resting the camera on a table or solid object.  Additionally, it's so slow at taking them that ANY movement (eyes blinking, etc) looks like a massive blur.  And the video skips all the time.  It just misses entire parts.

Robinson", "ReviewID": "R1BX1ZKU4IBXLL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model Fujifilm camera, reviews here, price and functions. At the same time, I also purchased the larger xD card. Almost out of the box, this camera has given me nothing but grief. What others had said about the blurry photos I can certainly echo. A month or so after purchase, the lens would not open, or it would not open totally. I first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause....after changing the batteries, the problems still existed - SOME OF THE TIME. Not always - just sporadically. Just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities.In addition to that, now that I'm looking at other brands of cameras I find the xD card I purchased is not transferable so I'm out the cost of that as well. Another malfunction of this camera is after \"erasing\" all photos on the xD card, taking more photos and uploading the new photos, I found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones? I don't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera.I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone....it's a total dud. I'm very disappointed with Fujifilm and am now looking at Nikon and Cannons.

However,I found a simple solution.Simply press up on the zoom button to come back into focus! It was that easy,though it took me quiet a way to figure that one out. For some strange reason the A350 quits auto zooming after so much use.At one point my camera did fizzle out on me and refused to open the lens. I believe the problem stemmed from a particular incident in which I dropped the A350.Though my warranty covered the damage and it was returned as good as new. Since the incident,from time to time I run into a little mechanical trouble,but not enough to call it a habit. The zoom works good,though a full on zoom of any particular object is almost futile,due to the fact zooming in the A350 to its full capacity causes the batteries to die very fast.In that regard this camera fails but that doesn't cause it to falter completely.The highlight of this camera is the simple construction along with an easy to use interface,with the ability to take quality pictures. I've managed to snap a few I still can't believe  was capable of being taken on this little camera.If you're reading this review now,most likely you're in the market for an affordable camera that takes good pictures. This camera does this and a little more.Another feature of the A350 is the ability to record video. The quality isn't amazing but i've found it to deliver decent video considering the fact this device is primemarily a camera. It's a nice extra for the low price. By todays standards this camera is eclipsed by more modern creations but that doesn't mean it isn't without charm.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "a350 fuji . I guess ok for price.", "Author": "S. Nelson", "ReviewID": "R1OJBJ8FUMQFAY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a nice used fuji a350. IT's good for the most part. Software is good to use, if you know anything about draging highlighted stuff over to a folder. It took me some time to figure it out. The camera in the first few weeks, the telescoping lense somehow got cocked out of possition, and would not slide back in. I don't know if it was bumped or jumped gear? I very carefully, examined it, and did some chriopractic bone snap and got it back in place and seems to work now. The pics turn out nice for the most part. , but can be blurry probably due to movement?. Im not happy with very close up's, but maybe there is a manual setting?? You must stay away about 18 inches for it to not be blurry. The flash I think is alittle under-power, so night shots should be with normal talking distance. The Video mode sucks. sound and video skip about every 10 seconds. Sometimes making the sound off track of the video for quick split second or cuts out. I don't know if this is normal or is my camera bad? but im figuring from my research it very well could be normal for this model. But the video does come in handy if your not worried about little skips or missing words due to audio cutting as well. I dont like the delay when you take a picture. THis is my first real dig. camera, comming from a kodak dc20 win.3.1 type. so I will know what to look for when i get a different one, but for now, I think 5mp will be fine for my picture taking.

It just won't focus close up (under 2 feet) very well.  Trying to get fine detail on smaller objects is impossible. I am buying another camera for close up pics.

For the price I paid it takes good pics.I didn't have the blurry picture issues that some folks have complained about.  I suspect a lot of them were taking pictures indoors and had turned the flash off.However, both of these have had problems with the lens sticking.  The first one was an A345 and it's lens failed after about 13 months, i.e. after the warranty ran out.I bought the A350 as a replacement about a year ago because I liked the layout of the controls on the A345 and the optical viewfinder, great for action shots.  I love the continuous shooting mode, if you're trying to catch a good shot of a duck coming in for a landing or taking off, or any other kind of action shot this feature works great.Now the lens is starting to stick on the A350.  From the other reviews I've seen this appears to be a basic design flaw.I like to carry a camera with me all the time in case there's a photo opportunity.

It's way too tiny and flimsy for my taste and has a very female look and character to it. I gave it to my sister who agreed it wasn't a very masculine-looking camera. However, she claims it's the perfect size for her purse, lol. All the pictures I took with it came out either DARK or BLURRED. You really have to play around with it to achieve clear, bright pictures and I don't have the patience for it. Also the LCD screen easily scratches - again cheap. I've dealt with many digital cameras in the past and while I could have settled for this one, I'd much rather get something I feel confident about its quality of pics, features and appearance. The camera is perfect for the young teen crowd with little experience with a digital camera. All others be forewarned!!!", "Date": "December 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "fuji A350 digital camera", "Author": "Kathleen M.
