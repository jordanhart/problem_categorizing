{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Louie J", "ReviewID": "R3DV2A8DD10XEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this wonderful camera for my wife. It seem intimidating when I first took it out of the box with all it's features but when I tried it out it was very easy to use. My wife easily got the hang out of it . It takes very clear pictures and the zoom is outstanding. But be aware going to close magnification requires very steady hands. The WIFI feature too is something to rave about. Take a picture and email it to whoever...amazing! Of course you have to be connected to the internet. For the price, I highly recommend this camera. I am seriously thinking of buying the WB850F for myself. FIVE STARS!", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent camera with a lot of features!", "Author": "Charles Gunawan \"Charlie\"", "ReviewID": "R3DZLT5SDKRXWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera from \"Beach Camera\" fulfilled by Amazon. It is about $20 cheaper than Amazon and it comes with a bundle (memory card, mini tripod, camera case, lens cleaner, etc.). This camera takes really beautiful and clear picture. It has so many option, you may not even need Photoshop to edit your pictures! Make sure you are connected to your router before you transfer your pictures. If you happen to be able to share your picture with the cloud, make sure you reduce picture resolution to 2 MB.Pros:- Built-in internal memory card.- Beautiful white camera (if you choose white instead of black).- Multitude of photo filter and \"Magic Frame\" (black/white, cartoon, silhoutte, picture in picture, panoramic, split shot, artistic brush).- Smart mode.- Programming mode lets you adjust aperture, exposure, brightness, color, white balance, and other stuff.- Built-in red eye correction.- Automatic face detection.- HD quality 720p movie recording.Cons:- Wifi takes a long time to set up.Overall, it's a decent camera but not the greatest.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung WB150F", "Author": "Terri", "ReviewID": "RW0WI54DAJQPB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice package deal and shipping was fast, I got it the next day. You are really getting alot for the price, so I was excited about this camera. I thought it was very cool with Wifi and all but sadly I haven't had any luck with picture quality. I don't know if it's just the one I have but it's been taking really poor pictures and I don't know why but it keeps stamping my photo's with a 2010 copy write statement which is annoying when you want to post it online straight from the camera.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "covered info.", "Author": "linda anderson", "ReviewID": "R22PVRR9XRT98", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It did'nt excectly cover what I needed.
