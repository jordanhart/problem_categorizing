I like vivid colors, and when set to \"vivid\", the Nikon S570 produces photos with beautiful vivid colors and excellent contrast. The wide angle lens has great edge to edge sharpness.  The Nikon S570 performs well, probably not the fastest (shutter lag and start-up time), but good nonetheless.  The only thing that it's really slow in is the wait time between shots, which seems to be an eternity. I've missed a few shots waiting for the camera to be ready for the next shot.  Otherwise, I really love this camera.  It's small and light enough to fit in you pocket, and it takes great pictures.

My wife does not at all find this camera slow between shots..no way  Some also say its blurry when you playback the photos.. Ours is not blurry at all and I played my photos back on my 32 inch HD TV..they come out clear as a bell. But some people DO have that problem..here is a solution that my wife says to do....DO NOT in any way ROTATE your photos from the camera..this could damage the memory chip you have so what we always do is Hook the camera up to the computer then load the shots on to that ..then you can rotate all you want..you will see the difference .I hope that helps people.Also..we have no need to use the software for it either.. we just plug the camera to the computer and take my shots off the camera that way  (just open the file) ..then I use my own photo sofware .. and Again not a problem at allThe Video is also cute on it..I wouldnt film \"important things\" such as one time events..but just for quick things..then its good .but thats not what my wife wants to use it for. so we dont mind it .All in all we are very very happy with this camera.Thank you", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Coolpix S570 High Value for everyday use", "Author": "J. Hofstetter \"MOAshooter\"", "ReviewID": "R3PETI3H05UUZC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are many good cameras in this category to select from, and all have Pro's and Con's that ultimately are reported in these user reviews.  These are personal opinion's, and mostely not scientific.  This review for the Nikon S570 tells you why I chose this camera over the others.Since I was looking for a camera that was portable and easy to use I chose to look at these \"pocket\" style cameras.  I've owned Canon, Olympus, Kodak and Nikon.  I've found that what I consider important is the ability to get to the picture taking mode quickly.  The next most important feature I look for is a menu system that is intuitive so that I can figure out how to do the things I want to do on a routine basis, like transfer pictures, delete those I don't want and perform a little in-camera editing.  Lastly, I look for a camera that has some automatic modes that make sense on daily use type cameras, like night mode, portraits and landscape modes.For the price I got this camera for on Amazon, this one is tops in speed and easy use.  It get's you to taking picturs very fast, from the time you open the box, until your a pro with it and just need to capture a quick shot.  No matter the situation, from family gatherings to landscapes, or low light shots to skinging movies, this camera rises to the challenge.I recommend spending the extra money for a large SD card to go along with the 12 MP capability and movie action.  If your going to keep it handy, It's worth the extra expense to get a slim case. (something that is easy to open)  Finally, even though this camera is not a professional type instrument, I've attached it to a tripod and have taken some photos over a wide exposure range to process as high dynamic range images.  This camera worked pretty good for this function. (I consider this a little more advanced function for this type of camera, but the situation called for a small portable unit like this one.)Get one for yourself and buy one as a gift.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "TEXAS12 \"TEXAS12\"", "ReviewID": "R3L2GV9M73YKRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before buying this camera, and I am quite pleased. I am a pro photographer who uses the Nikon SLR system, and was looking for a point and shoot. Although I am a loyal Nikon shooter, I realize that Nikon has not been the leader in the point and shoot market. However, this model has a great feel to it, sturdy and solid. It is small enough to take anywhere, and makes amazing photos,I love it. I think that a lot of the negative hype about this camera is from people who do not read the user's manual, and who do not have any skills in the area of photography. In my experience with this camera, it performs exactly as I expect it to- because I read the manual!

There are 17 different sene settings quick to get to. The CD ROM that came with the camera gives you lots of options to play with your pictures.

When you first take the pics, it's hard to see the clarity, but after they're on the computer they look great. My mom has an $800 camera and wants this one for mother's day. Great for the price.

Yoshimitsu", "ReviewID": "R1Q4PLZDVL2YWY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera due to its size (dimensions) and 5x optical zoom, and price range. We've only used this camera one day, but have discovered that even in auto mode, it works quite well. The photos generated by this camera have been crisp and clear, even subjects in motion were captured with little or no blur (digital zooming revealed some blurring). This is my first Nikon, so I haven't been comfortable with the navigating the menu; however, when working in auto the camera seemed to perform well enough for a Point and Shoot experience.The video performance has been the most impressive feature thus far. The image quality has been outstanding - motion is clean and not jerky and images are crisp not pixelated.I took this camera to my niece's birthday party and put the camera in my pocket while I chased my daughter on, over, and through inflated jumper, slides, and obstacle courses and didn't feel like I had a brick in my pants. In fact there were a few times, I had forgotten I even had a camera with me. Gotta love the small compact size.This one is a keeper.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ok Camera For The Price", "Author": "bz", "ReviewID": "RHR9V4WHNTWTR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am looking for a camera for less than $200.  I am looking for either a Canon SD1200 or a Nikon S640. No body sells the S640. So, I pick the S570 instead. My main reason for the SD1200 is the Optical Stabilizer.  Main reason for the S570 is the f2.7 lens. I finally pick the S570 instead of the SD1200.The S570 is the size of a deck of cards. It is very small. So, it is difficult to hold steady. The buttons are well placed and easy to use though. There are 4 options: Auto, Scene, Smile, and Movie. There is no option to adjust the shutter speed or anything whatsoever. I can only set the maximum ISO to either \"80-400\" or \"80-800\". That is the only option. If I need a longer shutter speed, I need to pick maybe one of the night scene instead.  The S570 doesn't have optical stabilizer either. So, I am not expecting any steady shot. It does have 4-way VR. It increases shutter speed and the ISO automatically.The S570 has a bigger lens (f2.7). So, it rarely fires the flash. Most of the time, it opens wide the lens (f2.7) and let the 4-way VR kick in to compensate the lighting and movement. The color may be a little grainy but the picture is a little bit sharper. You can turn off 4-way VR. If it is off, it doesn't increase the ISO. So, the picture will be fuzzy if thing is moving.I try the Smile option. It looks for faces in the picture. After it focuses on the faces, it takes the picture automatically. I don't have to press the button. This is pretty cool. However, it doesn't work all the time. People need to have a big smile like a pug before the camera can see you smiling.The S570 has a wide angle lens. So, everything looks far far away even the guy is close. So, I need to either zoom in or stand closer... in your face kinda closer. This is so strange standing so close to the guy to take the picture.My S570 comes with a standard Sandisk 2 gig SD card and a small case. Start up time is very fast but shot to shot is kinda slow because of the size of the picture. I set the S570 to the highest quality (12M with 1/4 compression). It takes 2 to 3 seconds to save the picture to the SD card (about 5meg). If I set the S570 to lower quality, it saves the picture much faster. The S570 also doesn't get a good focus all the time. I always need to try couple time before the S570 can focus indoor or outdoor.The case that comes with my camera doesn't use a clip or zipper to close the flap. The flap use a pretty strong magnet. Many reviews say they have lens error or whatever. I guess this is what happens. The magnet may damage the camera. So, I take out the magnet first thing. Hope this help.The camera is cheap and nothing special. I give the S570 3 stars.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't believe the hype", "Author": "Cowboy Jeff", "ReviewID": "R3VGQRDF9FJ50U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am not a professional photographer, I take pictures of my kids primarily. I was looking for a point and shoot that takes good still pictures for vacations. I was tired of hauling my heavy Nikon D50 and associated accessories everywhere. Well, after one 4 day trip of average to useless pictures, I am sending it back. I am in disbelief that all of these reviews are so favorable for this product.1. The picture quality is NOT GOOD: It takes ok outdoor pictures, but they lack depth. Indoors - the flash is useless. It will either add no light, or wash out the light colors and the subject's faces, even in portrait mode.2. S-L-O-W: If you don't mind waiting 5 full seconds between pictures, this camera might be for you. I used a class 4 memory card and it still takes 5 seconds to write to the card and focus again.3. Battery life is average at best and you cannot charge the battery in the camera.4. Actually something positive: the menu and buttons are really easy to use, the LCD is nice. The power button is finicky though and too small.5. BEWARE turning it off too quickly: I ruined at least 10% of my pictures by turning the camera off too quickly after taking a picture. It will write the picture to the card but will overlay the colors causing it too look like an old film shot that got double exposed.In short, I highly advise not buying this camera unless you are going to take still shots outdoors in good light and don't care about actually seeing the eyes of your subjects.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix", "Author": "William Alisauskas", "ReviewID": "R15TJ3LQY6GWEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i just love the camera.

Overall, the S570 is a good little compact camera: picture quality is ok and there are a plethora of functions (so many that most have not yet been used).  Two most useful functions to date are the \"quick retouch\" and \"D-lighting\" functions, both of which adjust the image so you retain both the original and the retouched image in the memory card, allowing both photos to be uploaded to your PC.  Processing is a little slower than expected as the S570 does need some time to save the image before allowing the next shot to be taken (partially linked to choice of high quality images).  Also, a bit slow to start-up but appears to result from the fact that S570 is the budget version of the S640 which has \"super fast startup\" which the S570 lacks.  The S570 is bulkier than the EX-S600 which it replaced but lighter, possibly due to lack of the optical image stabilization available in the S640.  Battery life appears less than the camera it replaced and the battery level display is not particularly helpful as it does not show battery life until the battery is low or completely out.

Rodgers", "ReviewID": "RRI9WB819TB8X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera looks cool but, it takes too long to focus between shots.There is a 3 to 5 second pause between each picture that is taken.  Once a picture is taken, it initially  appears out of focus...requiring you to view the pic in playback mode to see it in focus.  So you can't tell if you need to retake the picture until several seconds later.These 'few seconds' add up and can prove to be quite time consuming and annoying, especially for the people who are in the picture and are instructed to hold their poses like frozen snowmen until you can confirm that the shot was good or not.  In the meantime, bright, wide, happy smiling faces are reduced to impatient grins as they wait for you and your camera to 'get your act together'.  So capturing true \"Kodak Moments\" is almost impossible with this camera.Also, the camera has to re-focus the picture during playback mode so you have to wait 2- 3 seconds to view each photo.  Reluctantly, I plan to return this camera and am dreading having to start my research on a new model all over again.Then once the photos were downloaded to my computer I was amazed at how many \"adjustments\" needed to be done for color corrections, sharpness, color contrasts, lighting and etc.  Practically none of the photos were okay \"AS IS\"... they all required some tweaking.

I hesitated about purchasing this model because of the few bad reviews but I decided to go with the Nikon because the five-star reviews were more convincing and furthermore the camera had all the features I wanted at the right price. My first digital camera was a Canon Sureshot and I was so satistied with it that I wanted a another Canon. I have to admit that my the only problem with the Canon was the rechargeable batteries do not work! So having learned my lesson I realized I needed a digital camera with its own ion-rechargeable battery and charger. I have been reviewing the digital cameras for over a year now, and the Canons were just always out of my budget. So when I saw the Nikons were on-sale I started to review the various models. I was impressed by the look of the box it came in; to me, it had quality written all over it. I was not disappointed. I read the complete manual before using my new camera. I am very pleased with this Nikon model because: 1. The manual is very user-friendly  2. The camera is compact with a large display that has large writings, and the buttons are not too small.  3. Very Easy to use. 4. It  has lots of neat features.  5. It takes great pictures.  6. It took the photo without any delays.  7. The ion-battery recharged in 30mins when the manual said it would recharge within 1hr.  8. It came with a video cable that enables me to view the videos on the TV.  9. I can download the photo to my laptop or download to a printer and print the photos.  10. The Software installed successfully. 11. The Softwares are user-friendly.  I took photos right away and downloaded without any problems. I will be taking some outdoor photos next week and I am sure I will be pleased with all the photos.

The one think I loved about it was it RARELY ever took a bad picture. The s570 I thought would add on the already existing greatness of the s210. While it does take good pictures, every now and then I get shaky/blurry pictures.The biggest complain would be that for a point and shoot it does not automatically pick the best mode to take a picture in. Even when I do pick modes, it doesn't work the best. Maybe I need to get better at picking the right modes for a picture but lets just say with the amount I've tried, its not obvious exactly what mode you need t be shooting in. The image stabilization isn't very great in it. The Camera itself was a little bigger than I thought it would be, but it looks great though.The wide angle picture is great, you can capture way more with this up close than compared to other cameras (my reference was a Cannon sd1200. Although, I had to take the picture twice to get a good shot. The battery life is very good.

My son bought me this S570 for Christmas.  Two days later he returned it for me.I wanted a small camera to stick in my purse, my large SLR being inconveinent to lug around constantly.  I know I can't expect the same quality as my D50, but out of the approximately 2 dozen photos I shot inside, I will keep probably 4.  The quality of these photos,(I tried several settings) was worse than I got from disposable film cameras. They were just not sharp, the closer up photos were washed out, the wide angle just would not focus for me and the flash wouldn't come on in a large room lit with florescent lights, resulting in a grainy, unfocused photo. Maybe I could have played around with the settings a bit more, but I just feel for the 200 he payed I could get a camera that would be a literal point and shoot.I did some research and decided to try the Panasonic DMC-ZS3 that is a good price on Amazon at $240.

On the Canon, it was much quicker start up time - didn't realize how important that is.2 - When I want to \"view\" my pictures, the lens is extended - why is that? in the canon, i could review my photos without having the lens extended out of the case.3 - Switching from camera to video mode is a pain. On the Canon it is right next to the shutter button. On the Nikon, you have to go through the menu, then switch to video.

It didn't seem to help when I manually selected a mode.Once the camera did focus and I was able to take a picture, they often ended up blurry or soft-looking. The stabilization & motion detection didn't seem to make a difference.It took me a minimum of 3-4 attempts to get a picture that was in focus.Playback mode takes 2-3 seconds to bring the picture into focus; before that, it looks blurry on the screen even if it actually is in focus.The times I attempted to use Macro mode, the camera never was able to focus. Why have a macro mode if it can't be used?The camera also had difficulty with white balance in both incandescent and florescent indoor lighting situations. Some shots were okay when I manually set the white balance, but the auto was always terrible.Overall, it was a very long process to get a picture that was in focus, and the camera did not work well indoors, so it was not at all what I needed. I took approximately 50 shots in 3 different lighting situations, and none of them were worth keeping.I have used several other digital point-and-shoot cameras in this price range - Sony, Nikon, Canon, and Panasonic brands- and all of the other cameras have taken better pictures than this particular model.

The biggest problem I found is kind of dumb, but really really annoying. For me or at least on my camera the photos in the view screen NEVER look focused, even if the photo that was taken was in perfect focus. So it drove me nuts because I constantly thought the pic did not focus. Then there is the lag between photos, holy mother of god it takes FOREVER. I like to stitch together photos to make panoramas but making them with this camera takes an eternity. I had to bump the quality down to 8MP to make it almost tolerable, but what's the point of a 12MP camera if it's so slow at 12MP? My 2MP canon S110 from 2001 wasn't this slow. Lastly the autofocus was horrible, it takes forever to focus on anything.

I'll just talk about what I like and don't about this camera.Previous to the s570, we had a coolpix 880 - 3.3 M - state of the art at the time. It was sort of a crossover between point-and-shoot and more technical photography. It was always a bit to bulky, although it was pretty standard sized for the time. After having the 880 for several years, we faced the fact that we're point and shoot people, so after a lot of research, we settled on this one.About the 570:In the description of what comes with the 570, it doesn't mention a carrying case. There is one, and quite nice at that.It is very compact, and will easily fit even into your shirt pocket.No separate lens cap like the 880, always a nuisance - a door over the lens opens and closes automatically.Controls are easy to use, a little small for clumsy hands, but thats all of the space that there is to use.Finally, a good sized viewfinder!I takes up to a 25 minute movie (avi file), and records decent sound, not the best, but decent. It is not, after all, a movie camera.It has all kind of smarts that I have yet to master. Over time, and a bit more time with the manual, I'm sure that I'll be taking advantage of more of the features.It has sound effects, such as a shutter sound. I find this feedback to be helpful.Maybe I'm not critical enough, but I think that it takes great pictures - good enough for a point-and-shoot person.I have yet to go through a battery charge, unlike the 880 where I always had a spare ready.When you order the camera, be sure to order a memory card for it. Its internal memory will hold something like 9 pics. I got an 8 gig card - not much price dif. from a 4 gig. This will hold over 2,300 pictures. That is, of course, excessive, but I estimate that a 25 min movie will use up around 2 gig, so in that light, it makes sense.I found there to be a very short latency between pressing the shutter button, and the picture. This is contrary to other reviews that I read about it.Dislikes:Errr, I actually can't think of any.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, because I'm sure that a camera in this price range has some drawbacks.

It seems to have the 2 qualities that make Nikon different than other cameras.1. It seems to have a fairly good quality glass lens. (keep in mind this is only a $129 camera)2. It has a very good logical system for taking pictures that is very easy to learn and has all its features arranged very well. Nikon has always been superior in its design of features for ease of use and only putting in logical features for taking the best pictures. Many other cameras over the years would put in features as selling points but many had little to do with taking good pictures. When I got this camera it took me about 20 minutes to find every feature without looking at any of the documents that came with it. Better yet, everything was arranged logically and easy to find. This is what sold me on Nikon 30 years ago when I bought my first Nikon SLR. Mind you, this is an inexpensive pocket camera but it has more features than I expected.For those that give it a low rating for picture quality I suggest that they spend some time reading the user manual. Practice using the 17 preset scenes by pressing the green scene button. Also, small pocket cameras are more sensitive to steady in low light or zoomed. If you are in low light or zoomed in you might want to use a mono-pod or rest against something firm. Better yet, change the setting. If your camera was defective when you got it or soon after this is not the place to take out your frustration. Send it back and get a working one before you write your review, it's guaranteed. Reviews are for working items.I give it high marks for a pocket camera in its price range.

I replaced my old Sony DSW50 with this new Nikon. I was thrilled with reading the capabilities of this camera but alas it has let me down.1. Red Eye - I have a 17-month-old that I am photographing (usually in action) but he will squint or blink the minute the flash comes on. So, I either get squinty shots or red-eye. If I use the red-eye reducing feature, I get NO shots with his eyes open and forget about retouching - not an option unless you have computer software.2. Ease of Use. I can't quickly switch from mode to mode with this camera. You have to use the menu to go from photo to video and whatnot. That does not make it easy to capture a little one!3. The picture quality is not all that great. I love Nikon and have used an film SLR in the past and it was fabulous. With digital, I prefer Sony. Sony cameras take better pictures.4. Another point about picture quality...if you want to use the highest quality available on the camera, it takes too long to save and I miss another photo op. Not good. So, I have to accept lesser quality photos to get more of them.5. Lastly, battery life is not all that long. It isn't terribly short, but when you are say using this for a holiday, I wouldn't probably get all the pictures I would want on a single charge.Overall, this is a good camera. I am not trying to slam on Nikon. I do like this camera minus the points above. For my next purchase (replacement), I will be going back to Sony. I strayed from Sony because my last camera went on the fritz with the mode control (maybe it was a known issue) but the pictures and simplicity of use were far superior to this Nikon.

Like many of the new slim generation of digitals, this camera requires you to charge up it's lithium battery to get the camera to operate.  Charging time is excessively long taking several hours.Strangely, the LCD viewing area is 2.7\" which might be the new standard but is smaller than the 3\" area of the L series Nikon has discontinued.Picture quality is not a visible improvement over either of my 8 mp cameras and certainly not as good as the 6 mp (but larger sensor area) D40.  Facial recognition is hit-or-miss, that is, sometimes it works and others not at all.Most disappointing, however is the fact that this camera was only able to transfer photographs the very first time it was attached (via cord) to my computer.

The flash sucks and the delay between pictures is ridiculous! If your getting this camera to take pictures of your kids or pets or stupid things your friends do, DON'T! Those moments are instantaneous and you need to find a quicker camera to keep up with moments like that! I don't really know what's up with the screen either - whether your picture is in focus or not it ALWAYS shows up blurry on the screen.The one thing I am relatively happy with is it's video-taking ability.

Overall the style and ease of use are fabulous but the picture quality is absolutely horrible. In the past I have had Canon point and shoot cameras that were AA battery operated but I wanted one that had a rechargeable battery because the flash reset on the Canons was very slow. I chose the Nikon because it had the 5x zoom and a rechargeable battery. The only Canons that I could find with the rechargeable battery in my price range had 3x zoom and I had always had ones with 6x so I didn't want to give up that option. I chose the Nikon. I have never ever taken so many blurry pictures in my lifetime. I am by no means a professional photographer but I have taken lots of pictures and the quality with the Canon's was far better than the Nikon. Also after taking a picture the review mode takes forever and there is no way to adjust the length of time to review the picture which my Canon allows me to do. So basically I went from slow flash reset to slow picture review and I am still missing some good shots.

Fischer", "ReviewID": "R1NDP3J6YZHBT7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To address some of the issues other reviewers have had:If your saving to the memory card is slow, get a better class memory card. The class of the memory card impacts how quickly it will save, and bargain bin memory cards aren't going to work as well as better ones. On my first set of test shots, only one picture took the dreaded 5-6 seconds to save, and it was way over-exposed with flash.The LCD screen on it is a joke. It LOOKS like all your pictures are blurry because the LCD is so terrible- but once I got them onto a computer, I'd say about 90% were actually usable. Unfortunately the bad LCD makes it impossible to tell ahead of time which are good and which aren't, but memory cards are cheap. Take lots of shots and delete the bad ones. The LCD by itself was worth knocking a whole star off the rating.To also address the focusing issue: If a little red dot pops up, that means the auto focus has failed. If a little green dot pops up, then it thinks the auto focus was successful. Change the zoom or change your angle on what you're photographing to get it to re-focus. Also, it wants to focus on the closest thing it detects- so if, say, there's a giant plant between you and the person you want to photograph it'll preferentially choose to photograph the plant. Lots of cheap point and shoots I've used have that problem. Look for the green square as well. If it's focusing on someone's foot, for example, if their face is far enough away it will be blurry. Move your composition until the green square finds their face.

Sometimes you have to wait up to 20 seconds for the camera to finish processing a picture before taking another one. Another problem I have consistently had with Nikon Coolpix cameras is that they break very, very easily. Previously, I owned a Nikon Coolpix 7MP which suffered a light fall and the lens misaligned, resulting in a permanent \"Lens Error.\" The repair costs would have surpassed the cost of buying a new camera. I then purchased this Nikon Coolpix 12MP, which who would have guessed -- broke because of the exact same issue. I dropped this camera and received another permanent Lens Error. It is just my bad luck that these Nikon cameras break conveniently after my 1-year warranty expires. I have permanently switched from ever buying Nikon products.

I am confused as to why the focus system does not stop when maximum contrast is achieved- bad design.  At any rate, now the camera simply will not focus at the long end of the zoom range. You will watch the screen, see the focus pass your intended subject, then keep on going and quit, with everything out of focus.  It will not focus at infinity, and there is no method to get it to focus at infinity.  It is maddening to watch it continually refuse to focus on even a high contrast target set up on a white board.

I had an opportunity to shoot a little bird close-up and could NOT get a properly focused picture out of this camera.  I set it on auto and then when I was not able to get a good shot, I tried adjusting it to close-up and still was not able to get a properly focused picture.My old I-Palm did not have the 5X zoom, however, it was able to focus clearly on close-up shots and for distance shots the auto-focus was flawless!  I got some great pics with it.I purchased this camera to carry with me and have ready for unexpected shots.  The size is great:  it fits in my purse and is lightweight so I can carry easily when hiking.It does advance very slowly between shots.  I am sure the 5X makes it take longer for the memory to record the shot.Regarding color - things tend to skew to yellow.  I have tried adjusting it and get some improvement, but not much.

I wanted a camera that was compact, came in a variety of cool colors, and looked \"cute\".

Under outdoor light, the screen is useless, I cannot see anything on it and without an optical range finder, you'll never know your composition.The worst about this camera is that it takes forever to take a shot if at all!  As such, it is only good for still objects if it manages to find the focus and that is a big IF. It is a good thing that it has a tripod mount but only if I am doing landscape or still life. It is always hunting for the right focus as well and every shot is a missed opportunity. When it finally takes a photo, like after ten trials, it will then take an eternity to save the file onto the SD card. One could take a photo with a large format camera Ansel Adam style faster then this thing.One last nail on the coffin. The zoom motor is  completely uncontrollable. It goes to the extreme ends too rapidly and I could never get it to give me anything in between, so I ended up just walk back and fro to compose as if I have a prime lens on it.
