{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A powerful, compact, state-of-the-art camera", "Author": "Snap, Crackle and Pop", "ReviewID": "R2F63BFH0CZ03L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony's DSC-P9, released in June 2002, is the state of the art in terms of resolution and features in a very compact camera, with point-and-shoot ease of use.  At just 4-1/2 x 2 x 1-1/2 inches in size and 7-1/2 ounces with battery, this is a camera you can take anywhere - so you will have it with you and take more pictures.  It's smaller and lighter than many less powerful cameras, and smaller than earlier generations of Sonys.  The camera and features give you that feeling that they have really been carefully thought through and designed for ease of use, though it does take some effort to learn to use.  Features include:- The 4 megapixel (million pixels, or MP) resolution (2272 x 1704) is at the high end of consumer cameras, and should allow very good enlargements up to about 8x10.- The 3x optical zoom will help you compose good photos and make the most of your pixels.  The zoom lens is the equivalent of 39-117mm on a film camera, so will go from slight wide angle to moderate telephoto.  It's a very versatile range, though not wide angle enough to shoot wide shots in small rooms.- The lens aperture (opening size) is rated (max) at F2.8-F5.6 (depending on zoom; low numbers are better). This is fairly \"fast\" for this type of camera, making it better in low light than some.  The autofocus illuminator and the Twilight modes also help for low light situations, which challenge all digital cameras.  However, you will find it much easier to get crisp shots when the lighting is good (or the flash is used).- The DSC-P9 takes great pictures without requiring much thought.  But if you want, the camera gives you several white balance options; light sensitivity (ISO) settings of 100, 200 and 400; pattern or spot light metering; multiple focus modes (3-point, center, manual at pre-set distances); shutter speeds down to 1/2000; and a macro focus setting for great close-ups from as little as 4 inches away.- Other features include video out, to show pictures on your TV; and a metal case and metal tripod mount.- The computer drivers should allow you to use a wide range of PCs and Macs with this camera.  (Windows 98/98SE/ME/2000 Pro, XP Home/Pro, MacOS 8.5.1/8.6/9.0/9.1/9.2)For most users, this is all the digital camera you will ever need, in a compact package, with easy to use features.  It's not for everyone, though:- If you want maximum control over your photos.  Direct manual controls are limited, though if you use the features wisely you have some control.  Also, there is no option to save photos in uncompressed format; and no lens thread.  Consider the Canon S40 if these matter to you; the S40's image quality is also slightly better.  The Sony DSC-85 will give you even better photos.- If you mostly shoot snapshots, and never print enlargements, you probably don't need 4MP.  You can save some money by getting a 3MP camera like the Sony DSC-P7 or a 2MP camera like the Canon S330 or the Sony DSC-P2.  But having the extra pixels does give you more options, and allows you to trim the picture and still have good clarity.This camera shares many of the issues all digital cameras have:- You will have to buy more memory.  A 128MB stick will get you about 75 photos at maximum quality, and 2-3x more at snapshot quality.  Sony \"Memory Sticks\" are more expensive than other formats.- Start-up and shot-to-shot times are slower than film cameras.- The flash on a camera this size cannot match an external unit, but it is rated up to 13 feet, better than many compact cameras.- The viewfinder (for when it's too bright to use the LCD, or you're saving power) takes some getting used to, as far as what is in and out of the actual photo.- The MPEG movie feature is low-resolution (320x240), so of limited use, though this Sony can record audio and shoot any length (limited only by memory stick capacity).- Battery life is very good for this type of camera - you can get 100-200 shots - but the battery must be charged in the camera (unless you buy the Sony charger, extra), so for very long days you may want a second battery.", "Date": "July 8, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "GT", "ReviewID": "RCDQS6M7JBEAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing a lot of research on digital cameras to replace my aging Fuji MX-1200, I decided this seemed like the best one for the money.With the 4 megapixels you can even use the digital zoom without worrying about sacrificing too much picture quality -- though the 3X optical zoom will suffice in most cases.  The picture and movie quality are both very good (sound quality is also surprisingly good), though movies tend to come out dark if you're shooting indoors without a lot of sunlight (though, for a still camera, I haven't seen much better).The one thing you'll want to familiarize yourself with is the manual brightness settings.  Pictures indoors with sub-par lighting will also come out a bit dark on normal settings, but if you adjust the brightness manually (using Sony's easy-to-navigate menu system) it won't be a problem at all.The camera also has both USB and A/V out jacks for displaying pictures/movies on your computer or TV -- which are both pretty much plug and play processes.One last thing -- as is the case with all digital camera -- is that you'll want to buy a bigger memory stick than the one it's packaged with (16 MB).Overall, an excellent camera.", "Date": "July 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "Amazing Pictures - the BEST ultracompact digicam", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RSKOY2I491GXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very impressive indeed!. I spent a long time going through the reviews, trying them in the shops and found that NONE of the cameras currently on offer is perfect! This, however, is the **best** ultracompact around. This one provides excellent, sharp images even in low light. It is also very easy to use and is robust.The white balance on this camera is dead on - unlike many others than cant adjust properly under fluorescent or regular lights, and so the colours on pictures taken are exactly right.I like the fact that you dont have to take out the battery every time to recharge it - and that the info-lithium system tells you exactly how much shooting time you have leftAnd that the red-eye problem is negligible, compared to other ultracompacts.And you even get a bonus email-able picture every time you press the button : no more resizing in photoshop...A camera to grab and take with you anytime! This one has a strong flash as well. I printed out my A4 size (8x10) pictures and friends thought they were from a shop! I like the skin colours, and you can adjust the sharpness for a softer look on portraits. Nice sexy body as well....:)Treat yourself and get one for Christmas! I did , I also got an HP 130 photoprinter! Just select which photos to print on the canera, then stick the memory stick right into the printer, press \"print\" and hey presto : lab quality 4 x 6\" photos right away!

Mendoza \"princeneil\"", "ReviewID": "RGZQ20BKY5U5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my camera for over a month now and almost everything about it is incredible. The picture quality is outstanding and you have a range of resolution choices. The camera is very small...just smaller than the size of my hand, and features including picture editing on the camera(like zooming in and cutting on that zoomed-in part) is handy. You can also record mpeg movies(about 3 mins. w/ a 128mb memory stick), but you don't have light from the camera while recording. The battery time is over 1 hour fully charged, which is more than enough with the memory they give you. I purchased another battery because I'm one of those that has to have everything perfect.Only cons w/ the camera is that it only includes a 16mb memory stick(which only takes 8 pictures on the highest resolution), so I purchased a 128mb one. The wait-time between shots could be shorter(about 5 secs.), and the zoom could be higher(6x optical). Lastly, they do NOT provide a program to do more enhancing or editing. My uncle has a Canon and it came w/ a good editing feature program(photostitch) that will combine a number of pictures together and form 1 big one. Its good for taking big pictures/big families and panaromic shots.Overall, I'm impressed with the size and features of this camera, but the price may be too steep for 1st-timers.", "Date": "October 8, 2002"}, {"Title": "GREAT LITTLE CAMERA !!!

I got the Stamina Value Kit (soft case, memory stick holder case and one battery) for a great discount using this offer.  Don't pass it up !!!

First I would like to mention that digital cameras are still a long way from matching quality of the better film cameras using 35mm slide film and no where near the potential quality of medium and large format cameras, so you need to take that into account and consider what you will be using it for.  When I purchased this camera in June 2002 it was the cutting edge CyberShot.  I immediately dumped the 16mb memory stick and picked up the largest available (and still to this day) 128mb Memory Stick as well as a couple extra lithium batteries.  The great part is one of the batteries lasts right about as long as it takes to fill up a 128mb card!The pictures are outstanding for a digital camera, the other thing that is really cool about it is you can capture mpeg format video with sound.  Dont toss your video camera yet though, its dark light performance is hideous and resolution is not even close to a digital or tape video camera, but it is a neat feature when used under the right circumstances.My biggest grip is Sony never came out with Memory Sticks larger than 128mb and doesn't appear to ever support it.  They've produced a smaller MemoryStick version thats half the size but has an adapter to make it work but still none of larger capacity.  I recently read on their web site that they are comming out with a total new format that isnt going to be compatable with any current MemoryStick device but will have capacities in the future exceeding 1 gigabyte.  At max resolution 2200x something, you can get 65 still pictures on a 128mb card.  The pictures are in fact so good that you can stand 30 feet away from a soup can and snap a shot of the label, view the picture and zoom in to the point where you can read the ingredients.  You can also set it down to 640x480 and get like 1500 pictures on to that same 128mb card so theres a lot of flexability depending on your needs.Its a great camera if you need something compact and good enough to take pictures of things in every day life for instant digital gratification.  If you dont plan to blow up prints the size of a poster you will have no problems with the resolution and find that the max setting is many times too much for your standard birthday party or trip to San Diego.", "Date": "May 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "Very washed out pixelated pictures in low light", "Author": "D.

I have owned a Canon S110 for a few years now, so that is my basis for comparison.If you own a DSC-Px, you can try this test for yourself.  Try taking a picture of a friend indoors with low light.  Have the friend stay about 10ft away from you.  When you view the picture on the computer, you'll notice that your friend's skintone is very pixelated.  This does NOT happen with other digital cameras.  It definitely doesn't happen w/ the Canon.  I thought I had a defective camera, but not anymore as I've had this happen with two Sony DSC-Px cameras now.  Someone who has never owned a non-sony digital camera probably won't notice the problem.  I do admit that the Sony is a great looking digital camera, and it seems to be the only camera which allows for nealy unlimited full motion video.

It is compact, takes great photos with high detail, and it is not hard to use. While there are some downfalls (average close up focus and poor low-light capabilities), I find that these are not things that routinely prevent me from acheiving great photo quality. As for reasonably close-up photos, I use this in my dental office to take close-ups of smiles, and they turn out great. That should give you some idea of this camera's abilities. Many reviewers have hit the nail on the head regarding this product, so I will use my review to give you guys some great tips I've found.1. Buy the 128 Mg card, the carrying case, card reader, and an extra battery.2. Dont buy the charger. I find that if I have an extra battery, I usually get all the photos I need by just popping in the fresh battery when the first is low. Later, I charge the batteries with the camera's built-in charger. I actually bought the stand-alone charger, but it seems to take longer and is pointless since I am not using my camera at the time anyway.3. If you are like me and want to carry your camera in your pocket try this trick to protect the LCD: get some of those Palm Pilot screen covers and cut out the size of the LCD, and then place it on your camera's LCD. The screen can get knocked by keys in your pocket and not get permanently damaged. Plus, you'll never run out of covers because one palm sheet can make 4 lcd covers. 4. If you have a still shot to take in low light and don't want to drown out the subject with a flash, use the SCN feature to recover some detail. But it only works if nothing is moving.If you are looking for something to have on your vacations, birthday parties, and in the home that takes high res pics without the complexities and hassles of bulkier digitals, don't hesitate to buy this one.

It uses a proprietary Sony MemoryStick and a tiny rechargeable removable battery pack (which you can buy on ebay for cheap).This camera has many functions that even a die-hard photographer will go nuts over: EV, aperture focus, white-balance, spot meter, iso, picture quality, image size, sharpness, flash brightness, & record mode ie video, email, voice & more!I'm the dummy so I keep most things on default, and it still works well.It also features red-eye reduction, flash on-off, and video recording (but the quality is very poor so I advise from using it)You can choose from among 5 picture sizes:2272x1702 (4 megapixels)2272(3:2) -- I call this the widescreen, my favorite setting1600x1200 (2 MP mode, quality like 4MP, use if cramped for space)1280x960 (quality is ok, use for auction pix and shrinking later)640x480 (quality not so good, for email or low bandwidth use)All in all, in today's day in age, I still think that 4 megapixels is overkill for an ordinary Joe.  2 Megapixels is the best bang for the buck today.  But if you're into taking high quality pictures, want ease of use, want a decent fair price, AND want bragging rights, then this camera is for you!", "Date": "May 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Rodrigo Suarez R", "ReviewID": "R1HQZEFFRJADA9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Camera is better than advertised, you can take great photos on ALL resolutions plus as much video as your cad holds, buying a 128MB card is a must, but the size, weigth and 4.0MP definition ake it one of the best cameras around.", "Date": "March 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RXU95JDE7B75V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for approximately 3 months now.

I couldn't be happier with this camera.  I am not an expert photographer or anything like that -- just a guy who wants to get great pix at his family events.  This is a great camera for this.  One thing I need to note is that I have a very nice printer, cost more than the camera.

The Canon S10 took photos without my having to worry about lighting conditions and focus.  The Sony, on the other hand, takes really bad photos when the light is not perfect.  And it does not have a good autofocus if the light is a little low. It is not able to focus if the subject is nearer than 20 inches, even with the macro turned on.I sold the Sony after only 3 months and bought a Canon S40.

I did a lot of research and I chose this over the Nikon or Canon because I wanted an underwater housing for it and one wasn't available for those at the time. ... I have tried to get one from Sony but have been unable to do so because I live outside the US. The quality of the pictures is great and I often crop and blow up sections and the quality is still great, although I don't have other brands to compare to. My main problem with the camera is that so few of the features that I want to change from picture to picture are available manually (i.e. on the menu screen)e.g. high, normal or low level flash; Center focus or multipoint focus etc; portrait, macro or landscape mode; twilight, full-sun or shade, most of these features cannot be manually set by the dial on the trot. While scanning through menu features on the screen you miss your picture moment. There is loads of space on the manual dial for these features to be added on the next model of this camera and then I would give it 5 stars. I think if you change settings often another camera might be better. I didn't think that so many basic settings would be unavailable by manual dial. I am still trying to get the underwater housing.I would now add that I was finally able to get the underwater housing from Amazon and love it.  I am finding the lack of quick change from flash: (off, on, auto, red-eye, low, normal, high) a particular irritant especially since, as I have now realised that low light pictures are not that great.  Outdoor pictures however, are superb, especially pictures in and around water, which given where we live are the majority of my photos.  Red-eye is turned off and on from the setup menu, a major pain and so I rarely, if ever use it and choose to correct red-eye by software.  Low, normal and high flash levels are turned off by the menu, again a pain!  I think they should all have been alterable using the flash on, off, auto button on the back of the camera. I am still working on finetuning the manual controls to get better indoor/low-light shots.  I hope the new DSCP-10 has improved on these things.Unlike another reviewer, I have been able to take excellent macro photos of orchids and butterflies, I'd say as close as about 10 inches.", "Date": "January 27, 2003"}, {"Title": "A Camera you can count on.", "Author": "\"prodigy-sage\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q05O152HAA39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very good camera.
