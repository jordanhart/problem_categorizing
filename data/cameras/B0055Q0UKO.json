If the battery goes out on one,  I have the second one to use. If I misplace one battery charger, I have another one.  I have a sign shop and am always taking pictures of vehicles and buildings, either for work that has to be done or work I have done. In this business, I cannot be without a camera.  It is so compact, yet takes such nice pics.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera Fun", "Author": "Stardd", "ReviewID": "R1WJCA9IXWMIT3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Daughter used this as a backup for a European trip--Photoes were excellant and size was easy to carry and pack/handle---Her only complaint was that it couldn't do as much as the more expensive, intricate camera she also had(which was to be expected, but as a back-up for short runs, it was great!!--particularly if battery power or space ran out on the larger camera. Amazon was great on the delivery of the item too! It arrived sooner than expected! Thank you!", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth anything for anyone who has owned a better camera.", "Author": "LovePhotography!NotThisCamera!", "ReviewID": "R29LX0EA3VQKK7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My first camera was a Canon Powershot A520. We were about to have a baby and decided to retire it. It had been battered and abused and minor things were starting to annoy us (like shutter sticking). So we went to walmart and didnt want to break the bank on a camera. We found this Sanyo camera. It seemed like it would create better pictures than my other camera and be easy to use.Boy I was SO SO WRONG!!!!I HATE THIS CAMERA! We just resently took my now 10 month old to the aquarium for her first trick or treating experience and It failed me for the last time. It was set to auto (actually we tried every setting even manual) and every last picture that it took was washed out or way too dark. My husband is in public relations and works everyday with a camera and I took photography for 4 years in high school, you'd think we could figure this thing out.Its probably awesome for someone whos taking them in well lit places and who doesnt know that theres anything better. The camera on my phone is easier to use and takes way better pictures even with the lens being dirty. This isnt even worth giving to a kid whos just learning how to use your basic camera. It sucks and I wish I could return it.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA", "Author": "Caro", "ReviewID": "R1DWPWNBD1IUN4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these cameras to give to my family members, one at 12 months and the other one at 9 months after being purchased stopped working.  They never turned on again, they charged but they will not turn on.  I call the 1800 number and was told to do a lot of things and after 15 min of conversation was told they cant do anything.  So I will be responsable to get them fix.One camera is ok but both with the same issue, it is not acceptable.Both of them were rarely used.Send a little more and get a good camera or be prepered to by another one in just a few months.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera,good value", "Author": "rainedayz", "ReviewID": "REHS603AJKVTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is ok for vacation shots or shots of large groups of people or landscape shots.However,it doesn't work well for close ups or if you are wanting to take your own picture.I can't use it for that,have to use my Canon Power Shot A520 for anything like that.It's very light and easy to carry.It's also easy to use & it will explain what each setting does when you select it,so that you know what you are getting.The video feature is super easy to use and can all be accessed easily.I like the fact that it charges using a electrical outlet & also can be charged from a computer.So that way if you don't have a laptop you can still charge it away from home.I bought it because of the fact it uses the SDHD memory cards,which I had two of and it enables me to take literally thousands of pictures now.The HD memory cards are cheaper and hold far more pictures so that is the BIG plus for me.All in all it's not a bad little camera and the price is great.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "One drop and it's done", "Author": "Jess", "ReviewID": "R2IQJ21SWGTUUE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I previously owned the Sanyo VPC-S1070W. It was a great point-and-shoot and had great photo quality. It wasn't the best in action shots or hd video but the price was good for it. However, this camera fell short of the older model-pictures were just \"eh\", and after just one 4-foot drop the camera was done. Never again.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0055Q0UKO"}}
