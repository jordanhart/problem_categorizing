{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful System", "Author": "Donald Autrey", "ReviewID": "R1AUMOM3PF3PIJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product is very good and support from USA Security has been excellent. I basically wanted cameras to film the wildlife around my cabin (bears, racoons, cougars). I do not get a lot of people out where I am at, so I was not too concerned about facial recognition.First off, it came as advertised. Plus everything worked. I had to run longer lines than the 65' that came with the system. I found that cat5 with baluns works very well for at least 300 feet.The setup was easy. I am running things on a Mac and found that the software that came with the system did not work. However, support at USA Security emailed me the Mac program. The support was very fast and very friendly. They put up with some very lame questions since this is my first experience with CCTV.The cameras come from China so they of course come with mounting screws that are not worth a darn. I cannot understand why the Chinese will make a decent product and then add some junk to it. So toss out the mounting screws and use some decent ones. The actual camera mounts are sturdy enough. The manufacturer just saved one tenth of a penny by including mounting screws that are worthless.Using the system is a breeze. My wife and I can playback at will at the same time from our laptops while the system continues to record. That is really cool! I have not tried the telephone feature.I did not want to place the unit in my living quarters so I bought a Logitech 310 wireless mouse Logitech Wireless Mouse M310 (Silver) to control the DVR. The mouse works great going through at least one wall. The system does come with a remote and a mouse but I wanted a more hidden installation.The motion detectors are very sensitive (good!) and are easily programmed in the DVR. You can easily control what part of the camera view will trigger an alarm. This makes it very easy to eliminate false alarms from foliage moving. The 500 gig hard drive gives ample room for recording since all eight cameras are always recording. You can even customize the resolution of the recording from each camera.Anyway, my wife and I are very happy with the system and are glad we ordered the eight camera system rather than the four camera system.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "CIB 8 Cam HD Sony CAM  (4 Bullet with HD res -  4 Domes with Regular CIF res.
