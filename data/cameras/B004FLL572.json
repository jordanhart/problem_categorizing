{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exactly what I wanted", "Author": "sweetiebabe05", "ReviewID": "R2ML1UJN91WPI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera only because buying a new memory card and an extra battery for my Sony Cybershot that I've had for 4 years was going to be almost as much as buying a brand new camera so I opted to just get a new camera. Oh em gee...am I glad I did. I love this camera. It has everything I've ever wanted in a camera and more. The touch screen is so nice its like using my iPhone only with better quality pictures. All the different modes such as retro colors and old time photos and sepia along with classic black and white are also included. You can edit your photos right on the camera and crop out or colorize anything you want and add borders and text and even tag people for easy upload to Facebook. Basically its like photo editing right on your camera.I had a really old Kodak Easyshare when they first came out. It was clunky and silver and one of the first digital cameras to come out as as a point and shoot. That thing is probably close to 10 years old and it will not die. Its been dropped, beaten, wet, hot, cold, everything and it still hasn't quit working so I'm hoping for the same durability in my new camera but of course I hope I don't drop it anytime soon.As some people on forums have complained of course the directions aren't \"complete\" obviously its 2011 and most companies expect you to have some working knowledge of how to use a camera by now.My only complaint is that the battery has to be in the camera and the camera plugged in to charge the battery which is aggravating if you want to be able to charge a battery while using the camera. The usually the point of buying an extra battery is it not? So for that its kind of annoying maybe I'll find an adapter somewhere but for now I am extremely happy with the new camera. Not to mention its totally cute.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera for me!", "Author": "911Kaitlin \"Little Ham\"", "ReviewID": "R2ISONNJM3DXQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera on Amazon, of course because it was cheaper. I used to have a Panasonic camera that I purchased around the Thanksgiving sale 2010 for $88. I thought it was a great deal, but it has only lasted me this long. It was time for a new camera.I take hundreds of pictures at a time - I have a 1yr old son that I enjoy taking pictures of. When the pictures were getting fuzzy, I decided it was time to invest in a new camera. I did lots of reserach, and I decided on this Kodak Touch Camera. I am so happy with it so far. As I added in the attributes above, I give the picture quality 5 stars. They are so clear and crisp. Sometimes I take a picture and my hand will shake, and the picture still comes out perfectly clear. I love it for that aspect.Initally using the camera, the internal memory only held 4 pictures. I completely forgot to order a memory card to go along with it. I ended up ordering a 8GB memory card, and now the camera holds 1700 pictures, and 30 mintues of video! Speaking of video, it takes great videos! The camrea picks up the right volume and great picture. You can keep going consecutively with the video - some other camera's I've had only allow 2 or 3 minutes at a time, then you have to start all over again. The pictures up-load to the computer very fast. You can use the Facebook app to directly upload them to your accout. Also, mine automatically uploads to my snapfish account which is nice too. Overall, this camera is 4 stars to me -- I definately recommend it.There are just a few flaws: Another attribute I added with only 3 stars was the Performace Speed of the camera. When you take a picture, and it shows you what it looks like, it takes a very long time for it to clear off of the screen. I'm not sure if there is any way to get past looking at it for so long, but I've tried a few different buttons to speed it up and it doesn't work. Also, it is very slow when you try to delete a picture right away after taking it. You press the garbage can symbol, and then \"yes\" that you would like to delete it. It takes approx 7 seconds to clear off of the screen. That may not seem like a long time thinking about it, but when you are sitting there with a picture perfect moment, and it is taking so long to clear, you will get frustrated too. My way around that; if you are taking mulitple pictures, and you have a bad one... wait until you up-load them on your computer, delete it then, not on the actual camera. I will edit if I have any further comments/ and knock on wood any problems!", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Lilly Nelson", "ReviewID": "RHL2OYY3C3GK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had this camera for 1 day, but so far I love it. It was super easy to set up, and all the required software is right in the camera memory (no CDs to deal with!) It takes MUCH clearer pictures than my old camera (a Casio Exilim, which, admittedly, sucked!)  I take a lot of pictures of my active toddler and so far all my photos have turned out nice and clear.  I also take photos for my Etsy store, and the photos with this camera (and the right lighting) are much brighter and clearer straight from the camera, so require less editing.I like the touch screen, it's a little frustrating sometimes if you have \"fat fingers\" and want to change a setting quickly.  But should be pretty easy to get used to, and it's definitely more intuitive than a button interface.I haven't used many of the \"fancy\" settings yet but I will update my review later once I've tried them out.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to using this camera for a long time.Edit: February 12, 2013 - After over a year and a half I still love this camera and it's still going strong!  I was afraid the touchscreen would not hold up well over time, especially with small children around, but it is still working great.  I also have taken a ton of videos of my kids with this camera and actually ended up getting rid of our \"real\" video camera because it was just so much easier to grab this one instead, and the video quality is just fine.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing!!!!", "Author": "eyelashes", "ReviewID": "R2ILLY4XK1LLJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little nervous to buy this camera after reading a couple bad reviews, but I'm so glad I bought it! It has the coolest features and editing options I've ever seen! The touch screen is very responsive and easy to use. I haven't even looked at the manual yet and I don't think I will need to. This is the best camera I've ever had and I definately reccommend it to anybody.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Second Kodak", "Author": "Joanne M.", "ReviewID": "RYRWHQ4Q4U35H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera after having a 5MP Kodak which I was very happy with for several years and was disappointed with the new Kodak.  Let me first say that the picture quality is very good on this little camera in both day and night shots, however the fuctionality leaves much to be desired.  The touch screen is just OK, You have to hook up the camera to the USB cable then plug the USB cable into an A/C adapter to charge the camera, a real pain.  You cannot put a date stamp on the pictures when you take the shot, you have to first take your pics then go into review/edit mode and individually select the pics you want to date stamp and the camera goes through each pic seperatly and adds the stamp.  A real time waster and battery waster, and if you are like me that love the date stamp, especially if you take a lot of shots of your kids this becomes simply unacceptable.  My camera also froze up on several occasions and the only way to unfreeze it was to remove the battery and reinsert it.  So needless to say the camera went back and I went with a Canon instead.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this thing", "Author": "SaxGoddess", "ReviewID": "R3OITPMWKSFFOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera specifically for a last-minute road trip.  I also have a larger Sony HandyCam, but I didn't want to have to fly with it since it takes up so much room.  I have to say I was very impressed with the capabilities of this little thing.  The touch-screen at this price level was a really nice (unanticipated) feature.  Plugging the camera into your computer was a snap and all my pics were downloaded automatically.  It was pretty foolproof.  While I did have some trouble getting the right light in some bright indoor settings (museum), overall this is a pretty perfect little point-and-shoot for someone who doesn't want things to be overly complicated.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Tenswim", "ReviewID": "R15BPPLC8W6OCP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This touch screen camera takes excellent pictures.

It has been nothing but trouble from the beginning. It is slow to process things, to the extent that often when you're trying to take a picture, the moment has passed before the camera is ready. The camera also freezes, and the only way to fix it is to take out and reinsert the battery. The EasyShare software is the only way to transfer photos from the camera to the computer (you can't just use the Windows camera wizard or do things manually through My Computer), and never was a piece of software worse named: it is the LEAST easy piece of software to use! I have also had problems with the camera freezing when it is connected to the computer, which means that although I can take pictures, I can't do anything with them once they're taken, because I can't upload them from the camera to the computer. The customer service on the Kodak website is terrible; it always ends up telling you to check the owner's manual (which doesn't have the answers), and when you try to use chat or email, either no one is available to help, or the scripts on the page don't function correctly. I wish I had realized all this earlier; I would have returned the product and bought one from a different company.

Easy to program, it's instant on/instant off and easy to use. The LCD touch screen is crisp, bright, and Ipad like - pictures are reviewed with the simple flick of a finger. Battery life in screen saver mode is excellent.  Photo review on the LCD screen is a snap.  In smart capture mode, the 28 mm German SCHNEIDER-KREUZNACH VARIOGON wide-angle lens produces crisp daytime and even night photographs - all without flash while capturing brilliantly vivid colors.  Images are crisp and sharp. A host of special film effects are offered.  All this in a lightweight 5.3 oz package that easily fits in the shirt pocket.  A nice feature - battery charging is easy through the micro USB port, which enables \"in-camera\" charging, so need to remove the battery; simply plug into any wall socket or even the USB port on your computer (the latter requires an optional USB to microUSB cord); either will charge. It seamlessly synchronizes and uploads photographs to our PC, again via the micro USB port.  Not your usual point-and-shoot, this is a great value.Great things sometimes do come in small packages.

When it was in transit to my address I saw this M577 model on clearance at Target for $75 but I figured this model was being replaced by Kodak. The camera was disappointing from the start no matter how much I adjusted it's settings for specific photographic conditions. It just performed no better than a disposable 35mm camera. My friend has a 10mp 4x optical zoom Canon point and shoot that is several years old and does not know anything about ISO or EV settings yet his photographs from bright daylight to sunsets to stars at night were all sharp and without noise. The M577 actually took it's best photographs in Smart Capture mode with sufficient or outdoor lighting but there was to much flash indoors where a higher ISO capability would have been preferable.I returned mine and would strongly advise against buying this camera unless you just want something to take acceptable (though noticeably blurry and over/underexposed) photographs.

We were a little curious as to how this one would work having the touch screen because my husband has big hands, but he has no problems with it because the buttons are decent-sized and responsive.  The only SLIGHTLY negative thing I can say is the review time after taking a pic is a bit long and there's no way to turn it off - BUT you can 'dismiss' it quickly by tapping the shutter button, so at least there's a workaround.Nice little camera and a good price.

You know how older people are, the stick to a brand swear by it. Grandma was happy to just see the box, grandpa was a totally different story. Lol, he wanted to see the features, how many Mp's did it have, the works. This from a man with a 5mp camera! Lol! He was funny, acting like he knew what the features were looking at it with his \"reading glasses\". As soon as I told him about the one touch movie button for taping the babies, he was interested. When I said it was 14mp and a touchscreen, he was impressed. The icing on the cake, the added 8gb memory card that I bought with the camera, I can do no wrong for the next 6 months :)The camera takes beautiful pictures. In a dark room the flash will light up the subject but not the background so much. It took a little time to get used to the movie button, kept hitting it by mistake, it's right next to the shutter button. I've never been a fan of having a touchscreen on a camera (thats my preference), but the grandparents love it.

So I was looking for a cheap camera to replace the Canon and this camera meets my requirement: wind angle, HD video and charging battery in camera by USB cable with home or car charger. Also can be charged by connect to a computer.Put an 8 GB micro SD card in, fully charge the battery and turn it on. I Immediately noticed that the camera shows I can take 29 min video. I replaced the 8 GB card with the Transcend 32 GB class 4 card. It still shows can take only 29 min video. I charted with Kodak tech support. The tech did not have any idea and just told me to format the card. After format the 32 Gb card (it only took few seconds). It still shows can take only 29 min video. I just gave a try. After 29 min recording, the camera stopped automatically and showed the message \"for HD video only allow 29 min video...\" Now I understand why it shows 29 min in HD video mode. 29 min video occupies 1.7 GB memory space.
