{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great day light cameras, but watch your cable length if you want functional night vision", "Author": "Erik Okerholm \"some normal guy.....\"", "ReviewID": "R1OGMHJUBTYYIO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Cameras work great during the day without issue. I have multiple of these cameras set up at my house (front and back). At night some of the longer runned lines will not work at night. Not enough juice gets to the cameras. I called Nightowl and they told me max was 150 ft. I disagree.  I even went out and got a 15v 2Amp plug and tried powering locally and from the main unit without success.  Very cool product and interface. Really cool to see the cameras on your phone with the free app, however keep your cable runs to 120 ft or below. The 15v 2A plug does help some if you have power degrade on your line.I have a custom covered patio so retrieving/replacing the lines was not an option. They were pre-wired during construction, which might be the issue, might not. We tried multiple steps to get it resolved.3 stars just because some of my cameras don't work at night.Also don't believe the hype on the resolution. I have been unimpressed with the clarity of images at night. We did catch some vandals on camera one night, but resoultion was too poor to recognize.Good detterrant, but if you need crisper imagery and night vision, I'd go with something else more expensive and thorough.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "Easily connects to any TV (RCA) or DVR (BNC)\nIndoor/outdoor metal housing\nLED Array technology.
