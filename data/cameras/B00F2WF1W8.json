The main problem was that it was not exactly \"pocketable\" (even less so with the EVF attached) but more of a \"big coat pocket camera\". My venerable LX5 had seen a lot of use and was getting a bit long-in-the-tooth. I'd been looking for a replacement and had been looking carefully at the Panasonic LX7 and, when it was introduced a few months ago, the Panasonic LF1. At the time, the most striking thing about the LF1 was the reach it had for something that size - 28mm-200mm (full-frame equivalent)!When Leica announced their version of the LF1 recently for a reasonable $200 mark-up, it was a no-brainer as the body style was much nicer and I needed another copy of Lightroom 5 (which is normally about $150 by itself). Plus, I preferred a warranty through Leica rather than Panasonic as they've been so very helpful over the years with my M8, M9 and M lenses, often going that extra mile for me.I've been absolutely loving the C! In my opinion it is certainly a step up from the LX5 in terms of telephoto reach and photo quality. It's no M9 obviously but, turned off with its lens collapsed, it is exceedingly tiny and really can live in my pants pocket 24/7. Being able to tether it to a tablet or phone is also a welcome bit of utility.I love the macro capabilities, the decent low-light ability, the RAW file capability and the presence of a EVF on something this tiny. For what it's worth, the EVF won't win any prizes but it certainly does the job in bright light and that's all I need it for.This is a camera that you can always have with you and it's capable of stunning, high quality images, especially if you shoot in RAW format.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera", "Author": "HARRY", "ReviewID": "R2N5KVCGVZKHQJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally get Leica!!Hardware is solid, there are so many adjustment I can make, auto mode is super nice as well.I can not complain any yet.This is better than all DSR and compact system camera (D7100, NEX-7 A3000, NEX-5, GX-1), except D600, that I have had.I do not need to carry large heavy camera bag any more.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.00", "Features": "Fast Leica DC Vario-Summicron lens\nLarger Sensor 1/1.7\" with effective 12.1 Megapixels\nManual lens ring control allowing high flexibility\nHigh resolution 920,000 pixel viewing screen\nFull HD movie", "Name": "Leica Camera 18489 12.1MP Digital Camera with 7x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Dark Red Burgundy)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l4TwF931L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F2WF1W8"}}
