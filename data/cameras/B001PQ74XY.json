This TITANIUM edition is spectacular, even by Leica standards. The D-Lux 4 is a truly great point and shoot, with all the freeedom one would need to control the image being recorded. The TITANIUM version is unique as only 10,000 are ever going to be made and for $995, one has the chance of owning a Leica limited edition at a fairly affordable price point. This camera is chic, stylish and a gotta have for all those people who want to own the best of the best! The only difference between the TITANIUM and regular version is its collectibility...to me that was worth the extra $300. EVERYONE asks to see it and hold it - it is that cool looking!

If you have the money...just do it...splurge a little, you won't be disappointed. Filled out the warranty online, which gives me 3 years total.  Updated to the newest firmware 1.20 which was very easy using my SDHC card. The average person doesn't know the beauty of this camera, but those who know will instantly praise this beauty.  Beautiful pictures and surprisingly really good HD video in 16:9 aspect ratio.  There are many settings that are easily accessible with the quick user interface.  A large and bright LCD makes taking pictures very easy. Compared pictures with this and my fathers Olympus, this blows it away, the light that this lens brings in is truly amazing.  With it's matching case this is CLASS all the way around, you will get compliments from those that know.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Shmeg McGee", "ReviewID": "R3BOQUB75K095P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looks Amazing and build quality is perfect.  Even in snapshot mode the photos all look very good.A few minor issues though.1. You'll have to get a cord for the lens cap.  Putting it in your pocket every time becomes a hassle.2. When shooting video, the camera will constantly adjust the exposure.  So if you pan across an area with shade and sun it will go up and down as you pass different areas.  This may just be a setting I have not figured out yet though.Apart from that this camera is perfect.  I haven't even used my SLR in months.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "emk", "ReviewID": "RFDACHRQSYHNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Things you need to know:1. This takes INCREDIBLE pictures.  i can take professional quality pictures and have to lug around.... essentially nothing.2. The learning curve was a little rough but once you get it, everything is perfection.3. It is beautiful.  stunning.  it was worth the extra money when I bought this.mine was stolen from my house during a home invasion.  I got it back because in searching craigslist and ebay, etc., when the limited edition popped up on my end of the state, i gave the cops the serial number and had them pick it up.  i had had tons of stuff stolen (laptops, jewelry and so on)and it was the one thing i actually had cried over.  I was elated to have it be the one item that was ever recovered.i loooove it.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "Andrew Eisen", "ReviewID": "R3TYE5BH911BNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is simply wonderful. The quality of the images captured belies its size and format.  Highly recommended.  I can shoot fully manual, RAW.  The bokeh of the lens is sublime.  I have a full Canon SLR setup with all 'L' lenses and a 5D mark II, and as much as I like that, I will often take this one out because of the way the camera draws the images.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Beautiful, limited-edition titanium gray color\n10.1-megapixel resolution and 24-60 Summicron lens f2.0\nSmall, compact design with 3.0-inch TFT LCD screen\nRecord HD-quality video; 1280 x 720 (24 fps), 848 x 480 (30 fps)\n50 MB built-in memory; capture images to SD memory card, SDHC memory card and MultiMedia cards (not included)", "Name": "Leica D-LUX 4 Digital Camera Special Limited Edition (Titanium)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Lr654ceNL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001PQ74XY"}}
