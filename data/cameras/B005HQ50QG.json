Cawley \"Coffee freak\"", "ReviewID": "RTCJ7BC0BXN23", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was looking for a decent digital point-and-shoot with wi-fi capabilities, because frankly, I never seem to get around to wiring up my old P&S; and downloading all the pictures and videos, than uploading them to Flickr, Facebook, or youtube. I wanted a camera better than the one on my cel phone, but with the ease of uploading my cel gave me. Unfortunately, the Lumix misses the mark on all those requirements.The camera takes ok pictures. Better than my cel phone, but not as good as my older Canon Rebel P&S.; It's terribly slow to capture a photo in the slightest low light. I mean, in a well-lit room where it needs flash, it can't seem to find focus in less than 2 or 3 seconds. Pretty much pointless for any kind of action, like kids moving.But the worst thing about this $300 waste of money is the wifi. The software is terrible. The setup is so far from intuitive, I felt like I needed training in linux programming just to get the thing to talk to my wireless router. Then when I did get it set up, I realized you have to upload everything through the Lumix website. All well and good, if it worked reliably. But it doesn't. Sometimes the website is down. Sometimes it will talk to Facebook or Youtube and sometimes it won't. Sometimes, the remembered password works, and sometimes it says it can't connect.Worse yet, the movies that you shoot with the camera can't be uploaded wirelessly and they're locked down on the card, so I can't even move them manually through my card reader. The intructions are so poorly written that I still haven't figured out how to download some of the longer videos from the camera. I sent several requests to Lumix for assistance and have received nothing but automated responses saying someone would be back to me soon. Two weeks has gone by and I've given up. Sadly, the videos of Christmas may be lost forever on the camera's card.Please don't waste your money on this mediocre camera. Save $170 and get the Samsung wireless camera. I picked one up from a local store and it works like a charm. It's still not the best camera, but the wireless works. It's easy and intuitive to use and it takes decent pictures... all without making me want to throw it out the window like this.Amazon, you'll be getting this piece of garbage back shortly.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sent it back", "Author": "Timothy Crump \"Sandwiches make poor bookmarks\"", "ReviewID": "R354MWS4F70CKT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought it for my wife because it is supposed to upload photos to Facebook via Wi-fi. It wouldn't connect to the Wi-fi in the store, but we wanted to try at home.....wouldn't work there either....finally gave up, and bought a different brand, which worked very well, and was more user friendly.No doubt a good camera.....just didn't work for us.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera with a ton of extra features", "Author": "Stephen Scouten", "ReviewID": "R1GZ7W6P4S15GQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had this for about a week now and think it is a great point and shoot camera.
