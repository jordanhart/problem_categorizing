{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great in low light", "Author": "L. Filip", "ReviewID": "R3HNF1WTVCW2F0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm impressed with the camera capability in low light. You can get professionally looking photos(no noise) in dark rooms up to ISO 3200. It's easy to use and you can play with the manual settings while you see the results on the screen, before taking the picture. The wi-fi apps work great(smart remote control, upload to devices, upload to Facebook, although for FB I can upload the photos only in 2MB size-maybe it's a setting in my FB account). I also like the time lapse app(you need to download it separately), and the picture effects. The only minus point is the battery life (maybe 3 hours of use with power save and darkened display, limiting the number of pictures you can take in time lapse mode for example) and its quite expensive to buy a spare battery.I warmly recommend it for the semi-professional user.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is almost new :)", "Author": "kaeun kim", "ReviewID": "R3J4IQ257UM62C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like it cuz it is zlmost new one and has everything in the box from the flash to the guidebook.Everything is perfect, except the guide book is in Spanish.
