{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good quality point and shoot camera", "Author": "moviefan", "ReviewID": "R2O18QSFKEN9HH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great point and shoot camera. The 20X optical zoom is very effective because the Image Stabilization kicks in and keeps the zoomed in shots very steady. The CMOS sensor is great in low lighting. Also, the kit comes with a 32GB SD card, which has lots of memory to hold high res pictures and 1080P video. It's very convenient to finally have great video and still picture capability all in one unit which slips into your pocket. I can highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "rxtwo83", "ReviewID": "RNS6RZR2M3S39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome camera that takes great pictures. It's the perfect 'step down' from a SLR or bulky bridge camera. It has a great zoom, can take live action shots, all while small enough to fit in your pocket.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$257.49", "Features": "12.1MP High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor\nDIGIC 6 Image Processor\n20x Optical Zoom Lens\n35mm Focal Length Equivalent: 25-500mm\n3.0\" LCD Monitor", "Name": "Canon PowerShot SX280 HS Digital Camera (Black) 32GB Package", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Eo6yYlZ8L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C7UL708"}}
