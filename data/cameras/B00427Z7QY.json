I've played with it for a few hours and can say that this is a user-friendly, nice pocket budget camera. I've taken several pictures with it in several different light settings and I am more than pleased. The menu system is easy to use and straight forward. There are some different setting modes that allow for better pictures of different subjects (kids, pets, close ups). I dont plan on using this, as I just want to take pictures without messing with the menus, but it's there for those who want it.The HD video recorder is what initially attracted me to this camera. The quality of the video is great as viewed on my Macbook and it looks just as high quality on Youtube.This camera is certainly worth the low price. Give it a shot. Would make a great gift for young photogs.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good camera if you are not expecting the world", "Author": "Marbles", "ReviewID": "R5JMF2CX4STYK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera on a Cyber Monday deal and was skeptical right from the start. I take a lot of pictures and was looking for something that was small, quick, and good. The first hour I had it I regretted the purchase, mostly bcs of the aesthetics. I didnt like the housing, the battery cover slides out easily and is plastic so I can see it breaking easy. The screen is not great and makes pictures look over saturated. I thought the skins were a cute idea but not worth keeping the camera so it almost went back into the box for a return ... but I had an event that night and decided to bring it along. After a night of use I decided that I really liked the pictures it took, it was quick to start up, and while I wasnt keen on the lag between hitting the shutter button and the actual picture being taken, once I got used to it I was able to compensate.All in all Im pretty happy with it. I took it to my dear friend's daughter's first birthday party today and was really satisfied with all the pictures I took. The only ones I deleted were due to uncooperative babies, not an incapable camera. That says a lot. So, if you arent expecting the world, this is a pretty neat little camera. I just worry that it wont withstand every day wear and tear. ::shrug:: We'll see.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty good", "Author": "Heather J. Mitchell \"heatherj\"", "ReviewID": "R29RMPF0HKEG3B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like Pentax, so I decided to get this camera because not only does it have like 14 MP or so, but it was only $99. Now that we got it, it does take pretty good pictures. In low light sometimes it has trouble focusing completely, but we have yet to discover all the little features in it so that might help if we do that. Overlal it seems to be a very good quality, compact, small, inexpensive digital camera.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good at half the price.", "Author": "Pogopedia", "ReviewID": "RWS4SBNTC2CAH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera produces sharp images relatively quickly but the process is made awkward by the LCD's extremely narrow viewing angle and an intense flash that washes out near subjects. EVEN IF you can live with such weaknesses, don't expect ANY service from Pentax or their Authorized agents - the company disowned this apparently disposable model as soon as it was dumped on the market. A slightly improved design followed it by weeks. Even simple requests like replacing the designed-to-be-lost faceplate screws just pissed off the elusive Support Department. Check your vintage loyalty to Pentax and skip these disappointing low-end offerings.

It offers a fairly good number of light settings and options, and the menu is easy to figure out. The picture quality is decent.  Compared to other compact cameras I've used, pictures taken in natural light setting are not as blurry.  Of course, you can't expect DSLR quality pictures.One negative is that it feels somewhat cheaply made, especially the casing and the buttons in the back.  It's a little bulkier than I expected too.  But neither of these really bother me so much.  I was just looking for a cheap camera I could use to take pictures with when I go out.I'm not much of a video person, so I can't give much input on that aspect.Overall, it's better than I expected given the price I paid.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "cant buy a better beater camera", "Author": "bkzk100", "ReviewID": "R2M2K4WG3Z0739", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "for the price you cant find a better camera to carry around in your pocket. carry it every where and if you break it you are only out $60.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "maybe the worst camera ever", "Author": "Fernando C.

It is made of cheap plastic which in this case is good based on price because it is light as a feather, it is tiny enough that it will easily fit in a shirt pocket and you won't even know it's there,but the best part is it will kick the holy beejezzus out of any cell phone camera out there. Outdoors in decent light it produces sharp true to color pics, and indoors photos still come out pretty good. Even the HD movie mode is pretty good outdoors. If I could change one thing I guess I would rather have it use two AA batteries because it is cheap enough to keep in the glove box of the car,so that is always there, this way when you are half way to the wedding you are going to and you both realize you left the \"good\" camera on the kitchen counter you won't feel so bad if you have the little Pentax ready to go.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "tank6192", "ReviewID": "R2RMM8GG4L5EX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could hardly wait for this to come in. im in afghanistan right now, and all of my friends have cameras to take pics with, so when i got this it was exacatly what i had expected!", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera...

Unfortunately the camera didn't work (it wouldn't turn on), so I returned it and got another.  The second one worked great, I was extremely happy with the picture quality, the size, and even the amount of pictures I could take per charge.The camera is very straight forward, the screen is a good size, and the buttons are adequate and clearly labeled.  This camera makes it hard to make mistakes.The downside was the fact that I didn't have a camera on my trip and also the face that you can change faceplated.

Reven \"Walt Reven Jr\"", "ReviewID": "R2NSA32QGWP4ON", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got this for someone as a christmas gift and tested it before hand. First off I will say this is not geared for a man or someone with large hands! Being a man I found it very hard to find the buttons or hold the camera. Now with that said I will say for a quick point and shoot camera it does what it's supposed to do, snap quick pics. Its geared more towards a womans hands or a teenager. Also dont expect this camera to do it all because it will dissapoint you if you buy it expecting it to do everything, it has its limitations.One other very very important thing to point out was this camera is supposed to come with a free $14.99 skinit dot com gift card and while it does ours came expired not once but twice! Amazon was quick and friendly to try and correct this mistake, pentax on the other hand forget it they still have not responded to my emails! Amazon shipped the second camera out extremely fast hoping the skinit gift card in that package wasn't expired but it to was. I am and always will be extremely impressed by amazons customer support and willingness to correct a mistake. Because the second card was also bad they decided to just reimburst us the cost of the gift card, again top notch customer service! Now for the pros and cons of the camera itselfPros----Small and built very wellFocuses very very fastExtremely accurate color reproduction, this camera amazed me with how good it picks up on colors and reproduces them!!!!Decent zoom for the size720p hd video recording, with one con(see below)Lots of fun and neat creative modes that actually work wellGood pictures if you use the flash, make sure its on!Decent hd video quality if in a brightly lit area onlyNeat how you can change the front faceplate with your own or bought designs!Decent flash fillCons----Horrible lcd color and qualityCannot zoom while taking a video and the mic location is in a bad spot, dont cover the mic with your fingers like I did!Pictures come out very blocky and grainy unless you turn the flash on or in a extremely well lit area! If you turn the flash on the pics come out fineBattery cover pops open way to easily and gets in the way!Not very good in low light and has problems focusin, again this is a budget camera so this is expectedThe buttons are tiny!

It felt like a toy camera - but that was ok.  The problem was that the pictures were fuzzy no matter what setting I used.  The 'auto' setting consistently took poor pictures.  The video was great.  I was trying to replace my canon 170 which is bulkier.  The video was better than the canon (due to being 720p), but the pictures were nowhere near as good.

The tiger skin did NOT come with this purchase.

Looks like one of those cameras that are offered in a \"get a free camera\" promotion.Thirdly, wish the cord to download the pics was a bit longer, it doesn't reach the top of my desk.Pros:Takes an OK picture very quickly and is very compact.
