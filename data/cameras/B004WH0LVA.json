{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Can be improved", "Author": "BWare", "ReviewID": "RBVV5SD8S775O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As far as daytime viewing and recording this unit is perfect: Very good image and various motion detection settings. Nevertheless, this model is rated for 0.05 LUX minimum illumination in the manufacturer's specs, which sounds very good for night time viewing, but that is somewhat deceiving; this model does not work without additional light sources (i.e. flood lights) and it's motion detection function is useless because the image is so low quality without that illumination. Also, setup of this unit is not for non-technical inclined; one of the main issues is that the units are shipped with an old firmware version and upgrading it takes a bit more than desired. The manufacturer's customer service is mediocre, and the worst part is that they do not have a clear warranty defined anywhere. One of the units had a faulty wifi adapter and kept disconnecting from the router, my repeated questions to the manufacturer for their warranty policy and to try to get an RMA went unanswered, both by phone and submitting tickets in their website. Nonetheless, the vendor came to the rescue after I explained to them that the manufacturer refused to acknowledge any warranty policies. They were very polite and offered to send me another unit in spite of having been more that their 30 days return policy. Not sure I would buy more units like this, but for sure will buy other brands of products from the vendor Avcomm Solutions.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004WH0LVA"}}
