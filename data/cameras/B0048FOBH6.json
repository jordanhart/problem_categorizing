{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pro Aluminum Hard Case for DSLR Camera", "Author": "Jeremy Polickey \"jlp\"", "ReviewID": "R3K2MLCYYR31BJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product seems to be well made, and is endlessly customizable with 5 partitions and a generous amount of foam for dividers.  The size is good, easily holding my Canon Rebel T3, a lens, and my Panasonic DMC ZS8 point and shoot camera, with space left for quick release plates, memory cards, cleaning supplies, etc.  The weight is good and the carrying strap is nicely adjustable.  I great buy for the price which, in my mind at least, offers more protection than a camera bag does.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$34.99", "Features": "Designed To Hold A Digital SLR Camera Or Camcorder along with 1-2 lenses and plenty of room for more accessories\nProfessionally Constructed From Reinforced aluminum With PVC Side-Panels And 2 Heavy Duty Hinges - Superior Protection\nPre-Cut Adjustable Foam Allows You To Custom Your Layout.
