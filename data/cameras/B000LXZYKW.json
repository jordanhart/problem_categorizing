{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great waterproof camera!  Above-average 'digital' camera", "Author": "Nemeo", "ReviewID": "R1YKS7SI3ESKGT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All the reviews & manufacturer hype the water/dust-proofness of this camera, which is fine, because it does a great job, is easy to use, and is fairly sturdy.  However, we used to have a Canon SD400, but we wanted a waterproof camera.  This W30 is a good camera, but I think we were spoiled with the picture/lens-quality of the Canon.Good: Water/Dust proof with not much fuss.  It just works!  Easy to use. Compatible with new SDHC cards (my current card is 8GB!!!). But 16GB and 32GB are on the way.  This allows a HUGE number of photos and video to be recorded on ONE CARD.  Just make sure to keep spare batteries.  One battery will 'roughly' last about 1 hour of video and a 100-200 photos (some with/without flash).There are no external moving parts (such as lens extension)to get trapped with dust/water, since the lens 'extension' is internal.The menu/capture-speed is good, but not 'quite' as fast as Canon's Digic II cameras (like SD400, or later).USB connection is a standard USB mass-storage device, so it should work on Windows, Mac, or Linux with no problems (thank goodness).Also, this camera seems to be pretty durable/tough.  I dropped it several times on CEMENT/concrete, and it got a few cosmetic scratches on the case, but all operations and the lens were fine.  But I might put a plastic screen protector on the 2.5\" screen to prevent scratches.  Another recommendation is to get a silicon skin for pool/underwater use (to prevent case scratches from the pool/rocks), or a neoprene case to keep the lens intact while traveling (since there is NO LENS COVER).Bad:  Video uses Quicktime-MOV files, which is good (potentially), but it's a bit grainy, and the compression is not great.  But I can fit a 'rough estimate' of maybe 2-3+ hours of video on an 8GB card.Ugly: Lots of grain/noise in low-light or even some normal daylight photos.  You can workaround this by manually changing the ISO speed to 64, 100, or 200 to reduce noise, but then you may get some blurry shots (due to camera/object motion).OVERALL:  If you don't need a waterproof camera, get a Canon SD-series (they're EXCELLENT).  But if you need/want something more 'safe', get this camera.  It's easily the best water/dust-proof camera on the market.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not very waterproof at all!", "Author": "Oliver \"Weagle\"", "ReviewID": "R1BR8SMCQ1PSHX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "While initially impressed with the camera, my enthusiasm waned when I took it snorkeling. 20 minutes later the camera was rendered inoperable as water had entered the battery compartment.

Gray", "ReviewID": "R9ZOXSFYLGM5E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE:  (I wanted to make this one-star, but the edit function won't allow me to change the rating...)My experience with this camera took a 180 degree turn when it leaked (while submerged about 2 feet for 20 minutes) in saltwater and failed.  Bummer, since it was on day 2 of my vacation, but Pentax would surely make good on it with a new unit (it was only 4 months old at the time).My real reason for the one-star was Pentax's HORRIBLE customer service.  Six weeks of waiting and a number of calls to relatively useless support people about when to expect the camera would be returned, and I finally got the camera back in its box from Pentax.  Great.  Put the battery in and nothing.  So I called back to support, and when I did, they simply said \"Oh, we found water damage in the camera so we didn't repair it.  It would have cost more to repair than the camera was worth\".  They insisted that I had 'misused' the camera (on my word, it was 2 feet of water for 20 minutes...) an effectively told me to piss off.My beef with Pentax is threefold: (1) the camera didn't live up to its specs (not even close!), (2) they advertise aggressively for action sport usage (see full page ads with famous surfer Kelly Slater holding his W30), and (3) a total lack of any sense of customer service.  They didn't even have the courtesy to include a note in the return box explaining that it wasn't fixed and why.I replaced it with an Olympus, and will never buy another Pentax product in my lifetime!INITIAL REVIEW:After reading the reviews of the W30 and the Olympus SW770, I decided to go Pentax for the better picture quality, taking somewhat of a chance that the waterproofing would work reasonably well.So far, so good!  I use the camera mainly for surfing (tuck it inside of my wetsuit) and was worried about the waterproof-ness given the sometimes rough crashing waves and dunkings that mother ocean gives.  I've taken it out 3 times now, and no problems yet.  The LCD screen is hard to see when it gets wet (and nearly impossible underwater) but the pics are always much clearer in real life than they seem on the LCD.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "do not touch this camera", "Author": "Patricia V.

I returned it to Pentax who (eventually) claimed the warranty was void because it had sand on the battery cover which has compromised the waterproofing. This is nonsense. How it could have worked under water with sand on the battery cover was beyond the Pentax technicians ability to explain. Also, the possibility that any sand on the battery cover had lodged there after the camera failed was also too much for the Pentax customer service (an oxymoron if ever there was one) to explain.So, lousy camera and even worse customer service.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "So-So, I own it, cant recommend it", "Author": "YeahSoMaybe? \"computersandmusicperson\"", "ReviewID": "R38F1BMMFGNY2B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "PREFACE/BACKGROUND:I previous owned an early predecessor to this camera (the WR33).  I * LOVED * it. It took wonderful pictures - quickly.  I was very happy with it even though it was sort ofhomely and had a tiny LCD.  After a few years, the WR33 stopped working.  I decide to get another newer water resistant Pentax that would be similar.NOW (2007) -  THE W30I bought the W30 a few months ago.Pros:* Big high quality LCD view screen.* Very sleek styling, slim camera, pocketableCons:* WAY long shutter lag* Noisier than all get out considering it's 7.1 MP.  My older 3.1 MP Pentax took better pix than this with better color.(I'm not picking on Pentax per se as I have noticed this trend in reviews of other camera brands.  Somehow in the megapixel arms-race for prosumer cameras image quality has taken a hit.)*  No optical viewfinder.  Which doesn't seem like a big deal with that gorgeous large LCD.  However...I was at the beach in august and found that I couldn't see a blasted thing through the LCD.  It was all washed out in the bright light.  I found myself craving any kind of other point of reference, even a spartan optical viewfinder. (NOTE:  This was an 80 degree day at the Oregon coast in late summer, not the mojave desert..).*  Overall processing lag due to too many modes/slow auto-focus.This camera has SO many modes and seems hell bent on wasting a lot of precious time thinking / processing / delaying taking the actual damn picture! ahhaha.  I'm NOT kidding.  All digitals have this to some degree especially below $400 mark but GEEZ.  My primary mission is to get a photograph within max 1 second of pressing on the shutter.My solution?  You'll laugh.  The only way I can seem to get quick response is to:  1. Put it on basic program mode with manual \"Pan Focus\" and I'm always manually setting flash to full on or soft as needed.  THEN I get an OK response.  Sheesh!  Also...the color and picture quality is \"OK\" - it ought to be great.  Subjective opinion:  I have the sense from reading the other reviews that for an everyday camera, the Canon's are doing a better job for color rendition in this price range.  For a water resistant camera, you might look at the other company that deals in this market niche:  Olympus.  Only complaint about Olympus is they use a more non-standard memory (XD card) but that's not a total dealbreaker.In closing:  Good pictures can be taken with this camera, but I have to \"coax\" them out of it.  I shouldn't have to do this and I certainly didn't before.Hope this helps.  P.S.  I have fantasized about writing Pentax to have them start making the WR33/43 again or to find the design team for that model and have them do their next one.  I can't picture that the same design team produced this fussy mediocre picture quality camera.", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Works as advertised", "Author": "K.

I used it on vacation and was happy with the picture and movie quality, battery life, reliability, and auto-focus.  I did find that other people unfamiliar with the camera had a hard time taking pictures for me, but then later I learned the camera has a special mode for just that situation :)Features I particularly like are the time-lapse and two different delay timers, plus the fact that each of the two dozen different modes has an on-screen description which pops up so you don't just have to guess by the icon what the mode does, like on so many other cameras.Waterproof is a real plus, as is SDHC (Supports 2GB/4GB/etc SD cards)It takes a little while to get used to the lack of an optical viewfinder, but other than the reduced battery life from having to use the LCD all the time, I don't miss it.", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware!", "Author": "D.

It's definitely slower and noisier than I expected, but it has some decent features, so we could live with the camera's limitations. HOWEVER, the camera leaked badly the third time we took it snorkeling. It started with water noticeable behind the LCD, and by the time I got the camera cleaned up, it was a goner. Completely dead. Please understand, we're exceedingly careful with our cameras. We actually have an underwater housing for a Canon Powershot that we've used dozens of times. I peruse the manual every time I use it, and always use the product in accordance with the instructions and recommendations. Same with the Pentax Optio. I read the manual three times before using it. In other words: Not my fault. The camera was defective. So now I'm off to attempt an exchange - for a different camera.My recommendation if you want an underwater camera - buy a good Canon or other make and shell out the big bucks for an underwater housing.

I took a leap of faith in the good reviews though and so far haven't been disappointed. I've plopped the camera in a glass of water several times and took pictures with it while submerged. No problems. I haven't been swimming with it yet but I did read an interesting piece of advice in the manual: avoid holding it in your hand while swimming as it may be momentarily subjected to water pressure beyond that covered in the guarantee and water may enter the interior of the camera. I take it this means wear it around your neck so that the motion of your hand doesn't cause undo extra water pressure on the camera. Beyond the question of watertightness, it takes great pictures. I've especially been impressed with the macro function which generally lacks on other point-and-shoots. I am not rating it as a five as I find the user interface to be too simple-minded for its own good. Yes, it is very easy to navigate, but I feel a little foolish scrolling through smiley faces, puppies and other over-sized, feel-good icons. I am also still wary about how it will preform while snorkeling, as by the time I get in the water I won't be in a position to return it if it malfunctions.Why did I choose it over the Olympus?

That camera gave good service and met its waterproof claims. It was used extensively for kayaking, skiing and snorkelling and eventually failed after being taken too deep.The W30 is now about 15 months old and has been used for skiing trips and travel in Oman but had not been used in water. I have been very happy with image quality and ease of use. I take mostly landscape photos so tend not to use a lot of the alternative settings. Reading other reviews I see a lot of comments about problems with use in water and I want to concentrate mainly on this area, especially as it is the distinguishing feature of the camera.Last week I took it snorkelling and clipped it onto the diver flag bouy I was towing. This put it about about six inches below the surface. after swimming out to the reef I unclipped the camera and found the LCD screen was half full of water. Returning to the shore I found the battery compartment was wet as was the USB compartment. I had carefully checked both were closed correctly before starting into the water.After drying out the camera was still not functional so I took it apart and did not find any obvious damage to the seals although water was still present in the main body of the camera. A check with a magnifying glass found no faults with the seals. It was not apparant where the water had initially got into the camera. I reassembled it making sure that the seals were installed correctly and took it back into the sea. This time the camera flooded before I even had my mask in place, again the camera was clipped on to the float. Water had penetrated battery compartment, screen and the main body of the camera. Again on strip the seals were in place properly.At this point I conclude that assembly is correct, the design limitations were not exceeded. It would appear that there is either a manufacturing issue that results in some cameras with good seals and some with bad ones or the seals have degraded since new. As the camera is now useless I plan to carry out some more tests using additional sealing to see if I can determine the origin of the failure and to explore whether temperature is possibly an issue (hot camera going into colder water for example). I am buying a W60 to replace this one but I think it will be treated as a 'splashproof' camera rather than a waterproof one.

IMHO the Pentax Optio W30 sucks big time. I sent the first camera back for repair because of the loud clicking sound the camera made while trying to focus in movie mode. It made so much noise that it would drown out any audio you were recording at the time. I asked if this was a problem they had heard of before and the tech on the phone said \"No, you will have to send the camera back so we can check it out\". Spent $34.17 sending the camera back overnight shipping because I was heading for the Grand Canyon in about 2 weeks and I bought this camera specifically for the trip. I found out later that this is a problem that goes back to the W10, continued through the W20 and is still a problem with the W30. A different tech I talked to later said \"That was supposed to be fixed with the W30\". They WILL lie to you. They will not reimburse you for shipping even though the problem is with their camera design. None of the techs would let me talk to a supervisor or anybody else in their food chain. There were many other issues I had trying to get the camera shipped back before I left on vacation. Made a bunch of phone calls and sent a bunch of emails trying to get my questions answered. Pentax has the worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life - period.The camera ingested a large amount of water about halfway down the Grand Canyon run and quit working altogether thereby depriving me of the pictures I would have taken had I bought another camera.After leaving the Grand Canyon, I was heading to northern Colorado to do some paddling so I called Pentax and told them that I was on the way to their headquarters in Golden and I wanted my money back. They could keep this water filled hunk of junk and use it for a fish sinker. I called them again while I was in their parking lot to let them know that I was there. I sat in their reception area for nearly an hour before anybody, besides the receptionist, would talk to me. I thought about getting arrested while I was there, then decided against it. Finally, two guys came out with a new W30 and after a half hour of talking I finally figured out that there was no way I was ever going to get my money out of these jerks - so - like a moron I took the new camera. It has the same problem as the first camera with the video.As to the ability to see the screen, nothing you can do will make it were you can see the screen in bright sunlight. You will be reduced to pointing the camera in the general direction of what you want to photograph and pushing the shutter button.If you own a Pentax, I wish you the best of luck. If you don't, I would recommend that you keep it that way. I don't like the camera and I really don't like the people that work for Pentax. There is a lot more to the story but I don't need to sit here and type up another couple of pages, just let me reemphasize - the worst customer service I have ever encountered. As a matter of fact - I think I'll take another stab at getting my money back today. I'll let you know how it works out.As it turns out - the second W30 was as big a hunk-O-junk as the first one.

We were going on a trip around some beach areas and rivers, so I thought a waterproof model would be a good choice. Also I have a Pentax DSLR and it takes great pictures.  However overall I wish we had gotten a compact Canon camera instead (I have an A-640, and it takes great pics underwater with the extra waterproof housing, which goes down to 100+ feet, unlike this Pentax which only goes to 10 feet!). This camera is \"compact\" but not super small, a little bulky still for a pocket.  The biggest problem has been the focus and exposure... it always takes so long to focus, and often picks strange exposure settings. Also being used the the Canon, it's so difficult to get any kind of manual control (e.g. exp compensation) to override the auto settings on this camera.  There are just a ton of little icons for every auto/scene mode you can imagine! Many shots come out too light or dark, or very grainy because the camera has picked a very high ISO. On the good side, we haven't had any problems with the camera leaking at all, it still works fine after a number of (not extensive) uses in and around fresh and salt water, as well as the occasional drop in the water glass as a party trick.Anyway, the short of it is if you have extra money and really need a camera for the beach or rafting or snorkeling then this might be a good option.

(another one in favor of Olympus - they have DiVX format, nice and small)Autofocus - if you turn on autofocus in Movie Settings which is very neat option speaking of the concept, you are going to have a constant noise from focusing lenses while recording. You will find out about it only during preview of your material.
