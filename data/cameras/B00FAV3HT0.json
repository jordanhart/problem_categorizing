It's not perfect by any means and isn't absolute top quality. But so far, it has served for my intended purposes.Case: Overall, it's a decent quality and looks nice. The metal snaps (to attach the 2 parts) seem like they're attached to the material pretty securely and it doesn't seem like they're going to tear off anytime soon. As other reviewers have mentioned, the case has two parts: one which covers the lens and the front and back sides of the camera and the other attaches to the bottom. It's fairly easy to handle but you will need to remove the top part completely to take a picture and the bottom piece to access the battery compartment as well as the side port compartment.Auto-lens cap: Works ONLY without a lens filter, otherwise the \"triangle/prongs\" which cover the lens will get stuck and won't close. Also, the cap triangles -- while not loose by any means --  could fit a little more snuggly when closed to better prevent dirt/dust from getting to the lens. I haven't had any issues with this but I also make it a point to leave the case on when not in use. Other than these 2 things, it works out well and is more convenient than having to deal with a manual cap. Note: instructions on how to remove the lens ring in order to attach the cap are NOT provided. But you can find demonstrations on youtube.comScreen protector: Not much to say here other than it fits the screen perfectly.Mini tripod: Works with the case on and screws into the bottom. I haven't really used this much but it seems fine.Lens cloths: These are also decent. Although the cord on the keychain one got loose on me.Overall, I would recommend this set for another LX7 user.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera case for Lumix LX7", "Author": "Igor Kundel", "ReviewID": "R2OCENWEBLHW2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just a few words to praise the product and service.

Cowart", "ReviewID": "R1FP22OHSJ1H3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this case. It seems to be well constructed and looks very expensive. While it is necessary that the camera be removed  from the case to swap batteries, I don't see that as a particular disadvantage. The battery door on the bottom of the LX7 doesn't look to me to be very robust and I'd actually prefer for it to be shielded from the possibility of damage. One reviewer mentioned a problem with the tripod socket on his particular sample breaking apart. I certainly don't dispute his word, but can only assume that he received a defective unit because the tripod socket on mine is made of metal and appears to be very solid.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid old school style case.", "Author": "wombat", "ReviewID": "R1TTLJIOFA3MD8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The case does a great job fitting and protecting the camera.

A. Carlson \"Herr Direktor\"", "ReviewID": "R4M3L5JZRF7TH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Its okay for a case in this semi retro-style but these types of covers really dont work all that well with today's LCD composing.  Just one man's opinion.  If using the Live Viewfinder in the hot shoe it obviously wont close at all.  BUT ... it does do what it says:  It works with the auto open lens in place (and filters) whereas the more expensive ones do not.  Also the base plate around the mount hole pretty much fell apart when I screwed the camera -- thru the case -- onto my monopod.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera case better than expected", "Author": "Walter", "ReviewID": "R3QP6ZEBGHQRSX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this case for my Panasonic LX7. I'll admit that I'm normally a leather snob and steer clear of \"pleather\" or plastic cases, but I couldn't find a decent leather case. So far, I've been quite pleased with the Goja case. The case looks nicer than in the picture. The soft lining on the inside protects the camera from scratches. The circular area that protects the lens is stiff and seems like it would protect it from minor bumps.  I am using the standard lens cap on so I didn't have any clearance issues. I noticed that some people don't like not being able to access the battery/card compartment without having to remove the case, but I don't mind since the bottom part of the case is what holds everything together. Too many openings and holes in the bottom case could weaken it and potentially allow moisture to get in. Granted, the case is not water proof, but the bottom of the case is the part that would most likely be placed on the ground or some surface that might be damp. To remove the case, all you have to do is turn the large screw which is easy to grab. So far, I've been contacted by the seller via e-mail to follow up on my seller review and to make sure I'm happy with my purchase. I imagine that if I have any issues, the customer service will be outstanding. I have not used the magic fiber cloth that came with my purchase, but it looks like a decent product as well.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quality, good price, fast service.", "Author": "D.

So far so good and I am glad I got it. Use it a lot", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect fit with an auto open lens cap", "Author": "K. Fortier", "ReviewID": "RRLHQFRO2UUIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This case fits my Lumix LX-7 perfectly even with the EZFoto auto open lens cap installed, which is the main reason I bought it.  The case states that it is 44% leather and 16% PU.  It appears well constructed, is attractive and looks a lot more expensive than it is.  The inside is a soft gray suede type material -- perhaps it is real suede, it's hard to tell.  The case is comprised of two parts. One part  screws onto the bottom half of your camera and can be used with or without the top part, which covers the top and lens part of your camera and snaps in three places to the bottom part.  There is a space on each side for your camera strap to come out so that you can still hang it around your neck.  You can use the camera without completely removing the top part of the case by just unsnapping it in two places and kind of twisting the case out of the way.  I can't imagine any reason that anyone wouldn't be very happy with this case, at least if you have the Lumix LX-7.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good bag that will fit with your Panasonic Lumix LX7 + Autolens", "Author": "Exia", "ReviewID": "RTFKUDKR579Q4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a case that would fit my Panasonic Lumix DMC LX7 with the Autolens Cap that is 4.7mm deeper(Model:ALC-LX7BK) Auto Lens Cap for PANASONIC LUMIX DMC LX7 LX-7, LEICA D-LUX 6 (4.7mm deeper for use with Filters) + MagicFiber Microfiber Lens Cleaning Cloth. This case fits the camera and autolens with relative ease. It doesn't come with a strap, but the LX7 does provide a pretty good one by default. It comes in two parts and the top part is removable by 3 buttons (one on the bottom and one on each side). So you can remove the top part off and it will leave your lens and screen exposed for some quick point and shoot. The bottom half attaches to the camera by turning the screw on where the tripod mount belongs.Pros:-Able to fit my LX 7 along with the larger autolens cap(4.7mm deeper)-Interior has suede-like material which offers decent protection-Able to remove the top half to allow ease of access to camera controlsCons:-Annoying to unscrew the base constantly to access the battery/sd card slot. I believe the official Panasonic camera cases had a opening for the battery/sd card slot which made it much easier.Note: I purchased the Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black) which fits well with this camera case.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera Case for Panasonic LX7, Digital Goja item model no.

The diameter of the lens cap portion is such that it accommodates an auto lens cap such as the JJC ALC-LX7B (Digital Goja Item # KM0147) or JJC ALC-LX7W. Didn't have the 4.7mm deeper lens cap (intended to accommodate filters) such as the JJC ALC-LX7BK (Digital Goja Item # JC0297) to test, but it might fit.
