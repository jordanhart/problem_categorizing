{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Innovative elegant camera, best buy", "Author": "M. Zhu \"Frank\"", "ReviewID": "RAAQJLDF6G5F2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony T200 is a best buy.  I have owned several Canon A series and SD series cameras up from 3MP, and this is the first Sony camera I bought, so here is my opinion comparing Sony T200 against Canon ones.1) Adjustable flash intensity: T200 offers three levels of internal flash intensity: soft, normal and strong, user selectable.  I haven't seen it on my Canon yet.  Soft flash is particularly useful for taking pictures on my kids.  Their eyes are so precious to protect.2) Smile face scene mode:  Sony innovation.  No Canon has this yet.  It makes life easy when picturing my little kids.  With other cameras, I have to shoot 10+ pictures in high speed mode and hope that one of them would come out with that beautiful natural smile. Definitely Sony advantage.3) 3.5\" LCD touch screen: another Sony innovation on camera, (only Apple iPod Touch has a similar size). As I measured, 3.5\" is the screen horizontal dimension, corner to corner is about 3.75\", no Canon has this LCD size at this moment.  Bright, clear and beautiful.  LCD surface has special coating, so no light reflection found on most other cameras.  Plain fun to frame a picture and review photos with this Large LCD.  Touch screen replaced those many traditional tiny navigation/select buttons, very nice to me.  Big Sony advantage.4) 5X optical lens: most Canon SD series cameras have 3X or 4X lens, but Sony T200 has 5X.  Lens quality is very good, as the pictures are sharp and clear.  Sony advantage.5) Anti-vibration: Sony uses Super Steadyshot feature which is a sensor based floating feature to compensate for vibration.  Canon SD870IS uses lens based stabilization feature.  They are both quite effective on this kind of compact cameras.  I don't see much difference on pictures.6) Face detection: both Sony and Canon digit III have this new feature, very good for taking portraits alike. Sony and Canon equal.7) Simple, easy to use menu: without even looking at the user manual, I can touch through the menus and start taking pictures in minutes. Canon has a good menu system too, I don't see either superior than the other however.8) Battery: Sony T200 has a relative small 680mAH battery and is rated for 250 shots, it does run down fairly quickly. Canon SD870IS cameras is rated for 270 shots, not any better.  Generally speaking, compact cameras using LITHIUM ION rechargeable battery requires frequent charging because their tiny size has usually less than 1000mAH in capacity.  If you are looking for cameras with long lasting battery, buy a Canon A series which uses AA NiMH battery with 2500+mAH capacity, you may then totally forget about charging issues.  It's bulkier though.9) Picture quality: nothing above is important if the pictures doesn't turn out great.  In side by side comparison, Sony natural color mode is close to Canon vivid color mode.  Sony color saturation are great and close to life. Canon pictures is more earth and natural.  I personally prefer Sony color as I most often take family pictures and sightseeing pictures and would like a rich looking color scheme.10) Picture noise: outdoors, both Sony and Canon did a good job, no visible noise.  Indoors, Canon does a better job in noise reduction than Sony. Canon indoor pictures may be printed directly without noticeable noise.  Sony is slightly worse than Canon, although much better than Panasonic FX9 which produced horrible noise.  However, T200 doesn't bother me, as I have Neat Image software to filter out the noise.  After filtering, Sony T200 pictures turn out to be even better than Canon unprocessed pictures, noise is completely gone.11) Video:  Sony uses MPEG codec while Canon uses motion JPEG codec. For same time duration and 640x480 fine mode, Sony video file is half size of a Canon video file, so memory card may store twice the videos on Sony because of the MPEG codec.  This is Sony advantage.  In outdoor environment, video quality between Sony and Canon are comparable.  Indoors low light, Sony seems to automatically switch to higher ISO to keep higher shuttle speed, the good side is the higher shuttle speed the better image quality (less ghosting like on Canon), the bad side is the higher ISO the slightly more image noise than Canon. Nevertheless, none of Canon or Sony camera-based video can match to an average camcorder.  They are both good for day-to-day quick life snap, for best video quality, go for a camcorder.12) Some reviewer complains about Sony T200 auto mode performance at indoor low light shots.  It is true, but this is not just Sony.  Like all other cameras, including Canon, auto mode is only suitable for outdoor shots or well lite area, unless you don't care of the picture quality.  Tips: for good indoors shots, use T200 program mode where there are more choices in ISO setting, white balance etc for fine tuning to get a good picture.In summary, given that the current market price for Sony T200 and Canon SD870IS are similar, and all the points above, I consider my Sony T200 is a best buy, without regret.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Packs enough b(i/y)te into everything that u shoot with it ;)", "Author": "Ankur Verma", "ReviewID": "RJHN17F8USN3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Starts up at once with no noticeable 'boot up' time. Touch screen is cool and navigation is smooth, I actually am not missing those physical buttons, not even those dials. But I wish there was a way to lock it away at times when you don't want the settings to get changed by unintended touches while shooting. You need only shutter and telly/wide buttons while shooting, right? Kids just might find it hard to operate it without disturbing the settings.One of the things that its 3.5\" screen has made possible though is that it displays a good amount of info about your shot while keeping all the setups/presets/menus available on the screen at the same time.  While you are focusing, it tells you in order the shutter speed, aperture value, sensitivity and exposure value, which is cool.Enough maneuverability with great many presets for WB (white balance), ISO (sensor sensitivity); an EV(exposure value); etc. for the professionally inclined to get the best out of this camera. In PGM mode (program mode) WB, ISO, shutter speed and aperture can be played with but they are all given in the forms of presets to choose from (with the exception of EV that's given in the form of a scale).  I have a stand with me, I took some photos of far off objects using zoom to its limit, and keeping the sensitivity low (ISO 80)- a way to tell the camera to prolong the exposure, I really got good details, I think I got more that what I expected as it is not a professional camera.Night mode worked well, but its not outstanding.Smile shutter is an interesting feature but I found holding the shutter button pressed a bit tedious for continuous shots, if only there was a way of integrating it with timer.Macro mode gave pretty good pictures of rather close by objects.Back and white photographs were cool but don't expect too much. it aint flexible there as it provides no way of optimization. The grey tones are rather limited.Sepia mode is cool so are color mode and vivid color modes.It doubles up reasonably well as a camcorder (zooming works really well while shooting movies too), just that mic and speaker quality is a bit of an issue. It's a still camera but the length of the movie is only limited by the size of the memory and quality is great (you can choose from three quality presets, I shot the movie at Fine) which tempted me to suggest that it would actually be great if it had some sort of mic attachment provision in it. Speakers are weak too but the movie sounds well when played on TV. Its not a camcorder but the overall out come looked simply great on TV.When you run slide show on the camera, the music is hardly audible. But you can add better quality music files to the camera from your computer.Face detection is good, automatically focuses the faces and adjusts the exposure etc to best depict them, when multiple faces are being detected you can also touch a face to keep it on priority.Super steady is handy but doesn't help when there is a real and unavoidable shake.Computer and TV connectivity is painless. Movies play directly on TV or on media player.I think the interface has been kept simple, I cribbed a bit for a while for no textual names for most of the menus but now I actually think that I would myself had turned the text names off after a while. Although the features are numerous the camera is very easy to operate just that you would need to keep the instruction manual with you for a while initially, the camera keeps you abreast of the things its doing for most purposes.In-camera touch up software is fun. Good many frame types and clip art to chose from. You can draw on the snaps with the paint pen, but one thing that I missed while playing with a snap was `thought balloon' in the clip art. ;). Time to get creative !With so much, the battery had to take a toll. It is sort of lagging behind. The camera promises 250 shots per charge but I don't think with so many features you would use it in a disciplined manner. I personally played a lot with it and I had to recharge it within 4 hours of fully charging it. When, however, I use it `reasonably' the battery did last long enough, there is room for improvement there still.Overall a great camera for the price.", "Date": "September 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "An example of form over substance!", "Author": "Sinclair Cohen", "ReviewID": "R1NH66VO7BDPU8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been using a DSC-T30 for a year, everything about this camera is just fine. But I was seduced by the beautiful look of the red DSC-T200, and its large touch screen, so bought one as soon as I could. I returned it after a couple days of playing with it.Sony has added marginal features to the T200, but has downgraded the important basic features. The T30 has a rather large 4.4Wh battery, the T200's is a puny 2.4Wh and runs down very fast, especially with the LCD turned to its most bright setting. With the T200 you're going to have to carry spare charged batteries. This is annoying.Worst problem is indoor 'point & shoot' photos with the camera on \"Automatic,\" most images come out grainy and noisy. Heck, that's what an ultracompact camera is for. I don't know why this is, maybe because the flash lamp on the T200 is much smaller than the T30's flash? I open every photo I take in \"Photoshop\" and try to improve them, but these take too much work. Outdoor photos are better, but not totally wonderful, just OK.The LCD on the back of the camera isn't all that great. Instead of glass (like my new iPod Touch) the T200 has a somewhat flexible plastic membrane cover which requires a pretty firm 'push' to activate. When I push it to set the focus point while taking a shot, for example, the camera moves a bit.I've always hated having to remove the battery from the T30 to charge it, (because of the flimsy plastic cover), so was hoping the T200 might have a charging base accessory. Not. Oh, enough. I could go on. The T200 touch screen menus are very clear and simple to understand though, let me at least give Sony credit for that. And it's such a pretty camera!", "Date": "October 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing Photos and Touchscreen Trumps Minor Flaws!", "Author": "John Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R1X6MVD58V3V8K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing! It takes great photos and the 3.5\" widescreen touchscreen is very fun and functional at the same time (let the jealousy  begin!). I have had no problems selecting options and such with the touchscreen with my finger or the little \"stylus\" attachment that comes with the camera that attaches to the wriststrap. I was very impressed with the Slideshow mode, which has different style and music options for you to choose (e.g: the \"nostalgia\" mode plays photos in sepia toning and has slower music). Slideshows also look great when you connect the camera to a a TV. There is also a fun option that lets you draw and put stamps onto photos that you take. Even though I love the camera, there are a few issues that made me give it only 4 stars. The first is that the screen is not very sharp when you are taking photos. In comparison to a Canon Powershot 750 (3\" non-widescreen), the viewfinder is a lot more blurry and pixilated, although the photos become much more clear in photo preview mode. I've read that the T200's widescreen has the same amount of pixels as the old T100 3\" screen, so maybe this explains the blurriness. Another issue is that as a touchscreen, fingerprints get all over the screen and dust tends to collect at the edges of the screen. Since the back of the camera is all screen (which is awesome), this makes it sometimes awkward to hold the camera when shooting (while also trying to avoid fingers blocking the lens). I used to hold my old Canon a certain way and I had to adopt a whole new way to avoid touching the screen while shooting.  I've noticed the screen is easily cleaned though, so it isn't too big a deal if it gets smudgy. Overall, this is a devastatingly stylish camera that you may have to guard with your life when friends come by!", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "GOOD CAMERA BUT BATTERY POWER GOES FAST", "Author": "Mr. M.

Battery was dead by 2 PM.  On my other compact sonys battery lasted days. Next day I nursed it throughout the day but suggest to have extra battery on hand if you are on vacation.2- having to recharge battery you have to remove it from the camera- so easier to just pop in fresh at the same time3- camera is very small and lens is at top left corner where your finger wants to be around- so for large hands you must be aware at all times to keep finger away from lense.  On initial days use I had many picts with finger blur.4- bottom line pictures were good- I thougt they would be better being 8.1 pixel after using higher priced big older digital cameras by sony.  But probably the best they could be considering size and convenience.5- Video was exceptional far surpassing my expectations.6- focusing was fast,7- Yes a fantastic camera considering size and all.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "A wonderfull camera for the average user.", "Author": "Hector Munoz", "ReviewID": "R1HVGWJQKM3SXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion. As a previous owner of the T5 model, I find it to have many improvements over the T5.I have had a chance to use this camera and it has been simply wonderful. The touch screen menus are very easy to use after a few minutes of practice. Photos are also very clear and crisp. The smile shutter feature is also very innovative although is more for fun than practicality, but still a nice feature. I specially love the very large display. It is very convenient when showing the photos. The lens as usual for the Carl lenses, just fantastic. The ability to have 5x zoom in an internal zooming lens is absolutely fantastic. Also the ability to edit the photos in the camera is great.If you are looking for a compact, full of enough features, simple to use, everyday home or vacation camera, look no further, it is worth the price.

So it got a great workout right away. I am not a camera freak. I just want to take some pictures without the burden of carrying around a trunk of camera gear. The camera is easy to use and the pictures come out great. The widescreen really helps get the picture taking right. I love that I can take videos and pictures on the same device. The videos may not be of the quality some demand but they are perfectly fine for me. They capture moments that still pictures cannot and I don't have to carry two devices.

It has very cool features like the face detection, smile shutter, slide show mode, paint and many more. My husband was very skeptical about this one at first since we have been a Canon fan for years. However,he is very impressed with T200. Sony is known for its style, but not picture quality. This camera delivered on the style and features. As far as picture quality goes, not the top notch. But we certainly can live with that because we enjoyed the huge screen, interactive touch menu and shooting 16:9 pictures sooo much. I would say go get it if price is acceptable to you. For us the extra dollars are worth it. I didn't wait until it is on sale to buy because red seems to be more popular and run out of stock quickly- plus I have been tracking the prices for T100 -- the price didn't drop much even a year after it came out. Anyway, after researching for months for a high-end stylish camera with cool features, I am glad I finally found the match.I must admit that the indoor pictures leave much to be desired. It is not unexpected though,given the size of the sensor. Canon really gives much better indoor shots but come on, after years of buying Canon ( I have bought more than six, either as gifts or for ourselves), I am losing interests becasue of the dated design of Canon. Why can't they use some colors?? I have had six silver Canons and I am done with it. This time, I am choosing style and features over photo quality. You just can't have it all. I really wish Canon could step up to the plate to spice up their camera a little bit. How hard can it be, to produce a red camera?An update- we just took some outdoor pictures with this camera. They are very nice photos with astonishing colors. The white balance and the colors in the pictures can not be beat. Sharpness might not be as good as the Canon ones but I can say I really love it and found the outdoors pictures are much better than I expected.", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures, Great Features, Cool Camera", "Author": "Beth G.", "ReviewID": "R3ED7DSLQNXQJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have found the LCD to be very clear.

This camera does not even come close to either of those two.  I have taken hundreds of pictures with each and the Sony DSC-T200 I thought was defective but it was just the quality you get from a Sony I guess.  I think the Nikon S51C is the best photo camera on the market.  It takes awesome indoor photos in low light and superior outdoor. The Sony is you take an indoor picture you will see darkness all around the photo except for the object you are focused in on and that is fairly dark and grainy as well.  My advise is simply dont buy it. It is a very sharp looking camera I love that about it.

So I have had the opportunity to travel to Europe for this last Christmas 07'(;P, and was quite dismayed at the flash/indoor and low light capabilities of this camera. Outdoors it shines and has good zoom, and with enough daytime illumination, it is actually pretty good and right on with most DAYTIME applications.Now if you are trying to take pictures in the evening, inside with flash under normal lighting conditions, and/or nightime with flash, there are some major fallbacks and this needs to be addressed by Sony, they are not exceptable. For upons my excitement to utilize this camerea and then have so much problem and discontent, that I am taking it back as we speak to Costco, yah that red one you see. I spent two weeks snapping around 3000 pics (no joke) in and around London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, etc. Outdoors with sunshihne....beautiful. But espcially indoors at museums which has a fair amount of light, this camera failed on most accounts...period!  The battery issues were one thing, HAD to get a second backup battery due to the already mentioned battery sucking LCD screen which you NEED to take the pictures and operate this little gem. So for the most part, as well, one must continually change either focus modes, or fiddle between AUTO, Progam or SCN modes, to gain even a modest amount of capability in twilight, evening outside with flash or with ANY attempt at inside situation unless your are pretty close or if you stabilize or tripod mount this camera, is the only way to get a large prospective photograph out fo this little darling. So if you think about buying this for parties, meetings inside, don't waste you time. I mean the point of these little digicams are for convenience at the moment shooting, and with ISO settings up to 3200, Sony conveys promise as one would think they would have an edge on ANY light sitution within reason with such stats, but I can show you the proof, I have over 60% of my pics that were completley out of focus, grainy, even with the designated low light, firework, twiglight, twilight panorama program settings, believe me I tried them all, dismal at best in this particular area of useage, due to this camera's inability to do it's job, Sony has Failed on this.Don't believe me, well try to find drivers and/or firmware on Sony.com support for this DSC-T200, they yanked their support on everything.....so either take this back or ignore the temptation...just my little contribution to save you all some precious time...As for my once in a lifetime Christmas Holiday...60% ruined by this Sony catastrophe...BTW, I am an avid photographer, have lots of experience behind me, just wanted to tell you like it is without a bunch of useless verbage....good luck!", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beware: terrible pictures, wasted reputation", "Author": "X.

You wont see that on the LCD itself but once you transfer that to the computer and view it the actual grains and picture quality is seen. I tried all the options auto/PGM , EV, modes etc...but still the indoor pictures dont stand upto the mark. Outdoor photos are nice and crisp but all cameras can do that mostly. So if you are having party at home and this is the only camera that are using to capture the fun moments, once you transfer that on computer, your momemts may be ruined.

The Sony T-200 is considerably smaller and more convenient to carry around.Do not expect a mini-compact to compare with a D-SLR type camera - they don't regardless of pixel count.To get the best out of the T200, use the \"Program\" (P) mode and set the ISO to 100.  Do not use \"Vivid\" or other in-camera settings (do your adjustments in software).  Use Auto only in daylight settings.  The grainy, smeary pictures in low light are in auto mode, with an ISO of about 800 or more.  The results are not satisfactory.If you take command of the T200's settings in Program mode you can take excellent pictures in just about any situation except flash pictures.  The flash (I call it a peanut popper) is good for about 8' to 10'.  After that, since light falls off rapidly, it will not illuminate an auditorium at school or theater.  In those instances you may have to accept grainy smeary pictures in lieu of no picture.  Sometimes an auxiliary flash tripped by the camera flash can help in large rooms.I gave the camera a rating of 4 as I think it's pro's outweight the con's for me.Pros:  Excellent close focusing, 5X optical zoom, Small and pocketable, best styling - colors (I love black), When used wisely, excellent, noise free pictures, great color and sharpness. touch screen (recommend a pda type screen cover), plethora of controls including flash intensity.  Great face detection (and smile) and optical stabilization (vs. digital correction)Cons: Battery life limited.  Noise and quality not very good above ISO 600, a bit pricy, but the T70 offers much of the same features for less $$$$.I would definitly recommend a \"buy\" rating, but be aware you have to think for the camera.  If you want just a \"point and shoot\" camera, still use the \"P\" scene mode or perhaps try the Canon or Nikon.  Make sure you purchase your camera from a store that allows a reture privilege regardless of the brand you buy.

I didn't want to go for the touchscreen versions: T70 and T200 for the obvious reason of less battery life.Fortunately, Sony had stopped production of T100 and the ones in the market were as expensive as T200.I ultimately made up my mind for T200 thinking that if I'm gonna spend so much on a camera, why not get the latest one.I'm totally satisfied with the camera.I would like to clarify certain facts about the camera:1.Battery Life: It is obvious that a large touchscreen would drain the battery fast.But my experience has been really good. Once on a full charge, it doesn't run out that quickly as people say.And I'm a person who would take random pics of anyone and no one.So my usage is pretty high and I've never run out of battery.Its more about battery management than the actual battery life.2.Smile Shutter: This is the most amazing feature of the camera.And it really is efficient.The pictures are clear too.3.Indoor Pics: Some people complain that the pic indoors are very grainy.Although thats true for all the ultracompact cameras, but this one does a good job comparatively.I have rarely had tht experience.I don't need to write about the other features as people have already written so much.Conclusion: Its a great ultra compact camera and I would buy it again if needed to!!", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony Cybershot DSC T200", "Author": "Damon F.

I decided to upgrade from my Pentax 5MP because the flash was weak and the Sony T200 8MP just had too many good sounding features to ignore.  From the very first indoor shot I took (in auto mode), I knew there was something wrong. The image colors were distorted by the indoor lighting with an orange cast, and the flash over exposes the center picture subject (blew out the highs).  I even had a group photo taken in a room at mid day with large windows, in the auto mode, that should have had no problems, but the image turned out very washed out and grainy, like the camera had to choose a very high ISO - I couldn't believe it.  I spent a week playing with the Program functions (not in Auto mode)to get a combination of settings to take a decent indoor picture, with no luck, although the pictures were better.  Even after post-processing in Photoshop they were not near as good as my 4 year old camera takes without editing.  How can a company like Sony produce a compact point & shoot that doesn't work in point & shoot situations, that's the purpose of an Auto mode!  I returned the Sony today and bought a Canon SD870 for about the same price and immediately took several great indoor shots (in the same situation) with no special adjustments.  The Canon is great.  Note that the Sony did take very good outdoor pics, but most camera's do. I liked the special features of the Sony, although the menu system was terrible.

I wanted to get photos in the pub, in houses, out in parks, wherever. The photos would then sit in my Windows Media Center and play as slideshows (on my TV) while my Music is playing.The T100 was great. While the focus wasn't ideal (a bit 'soft'), it took great snaps with 'actual' representations of where I was without the use of a flash. So the indoor/evening shots were a true reflection of what it was like to be there. I fell utterly in love with the camera without realising it. Until I dropped it into the Irish Sea.I was devastated. Gutted. Really gutted. I missed that last set of photos (sailing around the south coast of Ireland over four days and there were some amazing scenes in there - now they sleep with the fishes) 'cos they were irreplaceable but I was going straight out to buy that brilliant camera again. It was superb.Unfortunately, I then found that I would not be able to buy another one as they were end-of-line and none of the local stores stocked them. So I figured I'd go for its updated brother, the T200.It's now 6 months later and I'm really disappointed. The OS has changed so the three basic presets that I used to use are gone and the new versions don't deliver photos that are even good, let alone near the quality of it's predecessor. I used to 'wow' people with the photos it took. Now they're blurry messes, overexposed startlers or underexposed duds.I have spent a few mornings, afternoons and evenings trying out various settings, using stands to prevent blur on low exposure settings (which I never needed to do with the T100) and experimenting with the new OS features to no avail. So unhappy overall.I'm stuck with it though, so I have learned to enjoy some benefits. Both cameras tolerated rain and water well but being touch screen the T200 feels more waterproof and, surprisingly, more robust. The touch screen works even when I've got my gloves on. The large screen is nice but don't be fooled: the 'widescreen' is actually a zoomed and cropped 4:3 so a nice viewfinder picture actually means a poorer quality resultant image! The focus is still more 'soft' than I would like but that wasn't a realistic issue for me before (but I should mention it because what's the point of 8.1 Megapixels when they give the focus quality of three or four megapixels).One thing that both the T100 and T200 still impress with is the video. Taking video with the little jeans-pocket sized gizmo is brilliant. It's a much better video camera than I had counted on (as was its older brother).So for me, great video and nicely waterproof but a disappointing camera in much the way that I find most cameras out there disappointing (I want something that takes true, good photos of my life). Better than most but can't fill the shoes of the T100, which was - to me - groundbreaking.Oh, and the gadgets are fun but never seem to work properly at crunch time - before the moment is lost. I did have a lot of fun one night in the pub, turning on the smile feature and telling people not to smile. It kept going off taking photos and they laughed harder each time, making it take more and more photos. Actually got some good shots that time... so not all bad.

In a way this was wasted on me back then, when I hadn't bothered to read the manual leaving the camera to its own devices, relying rather on its auto sensors.  As a result of which (fault mine) I had missed out on a gamut of features which are really rather good even impressive by todayish's standards. On auto mode, I had found the sensors to be a tad slow during the trip and had kept missing shots due to significant fire up time, something I had found rather annoying (but I couldn't possibly have expected DSLR performance).

Young \"ontheweb\"", "ReviewID": "R1RSFSRG0YBP3J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went to buy a Casio EX-V8 to find a compact camera with decent video and decent pictures that had more than a 3X zoom. Prices dropped a lot on the previously-unaffordable DSC-T200 so I played with it at the store. Ended up buying it.The touchscreen takes a little getting used to. Where's the record button? How do I switch to photos? Where are the settings? It takes a little mindset change and practice to get up to speed.  There is a 'Home' button to let you get at certain functions quickly, it just isn't obvious at first.Like many compact cameras, the weakness is indoors. Don't use the Auto mode. Set it on Program mode, with a reasonable ISO (400 or less) and shoot that way. The metering and focus setting also have a big effect on your photo, so if you learn how to use those features it helps.Macros are great, and there are the typical macro mode and the super macro mode to get within 1 centimeter. I have good results with both.The video is decent, I rate it 7 out of 10. Just straightforward 640x480 resolution with no bull. MPeg format instead of MOV.  You really only can change the framerate, but its simple and works well. A 2GB memory stick will hold about 1.5 hours at standard framerate or about 25 minutes at high-quality. The white balance settings have a big effect on video quality indoors. Choose the correct lighting style and the video comes out accurately. By the way, the sound pickup is excellent. Not sterero, but very decent.  I've heard some concert video and the sound is not all blown out like it does on many cameras.  It picks up surprising sounds in the room like breathing and other nuances.Focusing is quick. Very bright autofocus assist lamp. Maybe too bright. Easy to change the metering and focusing modes (When in the Program shooting mode).The flash? Well, its a compact, not a DSLR. Its ok.  I have great results with the slow synchro flash - it really lights up the room well.Full speed USB 2.0 means fast transfers.28mm wide angle accessory lense available.  Two different docking stations are available (actually 3).  The CSS-PC1 is for your computer.  The CSS-HD1 and new CSS-HD2 are to hook the camera to the TV for hi-def displays.  All the docks have faster chargers than the charger that comes with the camera (30% faster).Outdoor images are great. The 5x zoom is just right - I didn't feel that \"not quite close enough\" feeling you always have with a 3x camera.My expectations were to get a camera with decent photos (above average) and decent video that didn't make me have to work too hard, and can be put in my pocket, and this is it. You do have to work this camera a little indoors if you want better than average shots.  I have gotten decent no-flash results up to ISO800. ISO1600 and 3200 are not useable.I would buy this camera again. I love the touchscreen, and whoever thinks its grainy or said they would be ashamed to show someone pictures on this screen are simply wrong. There are better looking screens (very few), but this one is certainly on of the better ones.Cons:Big touchscreen does not automatically gain up outdoors. You have to brighten the display manualy (come on, Sony) but at least you can brighten the display.No viewfinder. Would be nice in a few cases.Its expensive. Proprietary memory sticks. Battery life sucks. Get the docking station because it charges the battery 30% quicker than provided charger. Learn to not put your finger over the lense.Could use a bunch more scene modes. The 10 or so provided are pretty basic. They should have one for indoor shooting, and one for doubleshot (flash/no flash) like Fuji has.The camera cables are special (not standard USB), but if you use the dock its not a big deal.", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera few misses here and there", "Author": "Scarlett Shao", "ReviewID": "R1DBABKZ9KUKOV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not bad overall.

Make sure to check out picture samples for this camera indoors, don't be fooled by the outdoor shots, anything taken in normal or even bright un-natural light looks noisy and grainy, even when viewing at small resolutions.I wanted this camera to take pictures at conventions, which are mostly indoors, and this camera was awful for that.  I can't stress enough how horrible the indoor shots are.  By changing the ISO level, you can improve the noise problem, but by doing so, you reduce the flashes effectiveness, and need to be closer (like closer than 5-6') to your subject, and you'll get some blurriness that way too, but it does look somewhat better.  For an entry-level consumer camera though, it's not very user friendly.Also, the battery life isn't nearly what Sony claims, even on lowest LCD backlight setting.  The touch-screen is pretty, but doesn't respond all that well, and anyone with larger hands would find the zoom toggle and other buttons frustratingly small.  My boyfriend couldn't hold the camera without smudging the screen really bad, there's virtually no space on either side of the screen, just a little silver bar on one side, which works okay for small hands, but otherwise, it'd be very aggravating.Also, since this camera obviously is at it's best taking outdoor pics, the lack of viewfinder is obnoxious, but par for the course for ultra-compacts, but the screen is hard to see in sunny weather, very hard, making framing up a shot and reviewing shots a pain.The video mode would have been nice, were it not for the 10 minute recording limit, that's annoying, and not present on any other Sony camera I've owned, even the much cheaper ones.For $400, this camera was a complete disappointment.  I returned this one after Christmas, and recently purchased the Sony W120, which, while a cheaper camera (MSRP $200), takes much better pictures, has better battery life, is much more user friendly, has a viewfinder, and is overall a terrific deal for the money.The T200 may be pretty, but don't let it's sexy touch screen suck you in like I did, it does not perform well at all, and is certainly not worth what it retails for, it's honestly not worth half that, unless you never take pictures inside, or have another camera for that purpose.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "retured!", "Author": "tutu's mom", "ReviewID": "R3F3DWU1JRXCAC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a sony fan, especially when it comes to their camaras.

What led me to purchase it was the large screen - I enjoy looking at my photos and displaying them as much as I enjoy taking photographs.In a nutshell, the problem is that this camera will not display those photos taken by certain other camera makers - certainly Nikon, based on my experience. Nor will it display any photos previously uploaded using computer programs or those photos which have been cropped or digitally altered. Of course, because all of my other cameras use SD cards, there's that hassle, as well.The DSC T200 seems to dislike any photos with tag marks that have an underscore. Photos taken by a Pentax are tagged with CIMG. They upload to the DSC T200 properly. So do photos taken on a Casio. But no luck with cameras taken with Nikons (they are tagged with a DSC_). The photos will upload but then show up as a 'file error'.When I called Sony, the representative pointed me to the section in the manual which states that Sony does not guarantee the ability to upload photos. He suggested changing the pic identifier, but it didn't work. You have been warned. If there's something I can do to fix this problem, please feel free to let me know.Picture quality of those pictures it takes is good, but show up on the screen as alarmingly pixellated.Battery is weak and will need to be re-charged frequently.
