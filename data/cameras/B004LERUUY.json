{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I had this camera to review for Olympus.  Here are my quick thoughts.", "Author": "Kirk Tuck \"Kirk Tuck\"", "ReviewID": "R32S08W72E63GR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I asked Olympus if I could review this camera.  I had written reviews for them before.  To preface the review I will mention that I own several of the Olympus EP2 cameras and the EPL1 camera.  While the EPL series cameras don't come with the accessory finder, VF-2, I consider it the reason to buy this camera and this family of cameras.  More on that in a second.  I gave this camera five stars but you should be clear that all ratings are contextual.  It's not a better camera than a Nikon D3 or a Canon 1dsmk3 but it is a wonderful and very capable camera for $600 (with a lens).  I consider it an $800 camera because I want to be able to use the 1.4 megapixel finder.Reasons not to buy one: 1. You shoot sports and need super fast autofocus and a very fast frame rate. 2.  You rarely see daylight and want a camera that shoots noise free from 3200 ISO up.  Nope, this one is not your camera.Reasons to buy one:  1.  The files right out of the camera (as jpegs) are very nice.  Rich and accurate color and nice balance of sharpness and contrast.  2.  It's a very stealthy package that flies under the radar, masquerading as a point and shoot but fully capable of great results.  No one will guess that you're a serious photographer.  3.  With adapters there is a very wide range of lenses from other manufacturers that work well with the camera.  If you want to try a Nikon or Leica lens for some street shooting this would be the camera to try it with.The big question I got over and over again in response to my review on my blog was whether this camera has better image quality that the EPL1.  No.  I find them identical.  But the newer screen and newer controls are better.The HD video is limited to 7 minutes per take but the quality (720) is very good and the camera has full manual controls for every facet.  You'll need to buy an Olympus adapter if you want to use external microphones.Why do I like these cameras?  Because they are quick to operate and very, very lightweight.  I like to spend hours and hours walking thru city streets shooting and the cameras are light enough to make this an enjoyable thing.  Not a job-like task.Now, on to the finder.  I'm old fashioned.  I just don't like composing a scene at arm's length.  it's a very compromised technique.  Olympus makes a great electronic viewfinder that works with all the Pen cameras and also the new xz-1 compact camera.  It's a 1.4 megapixel finder.  It's very detailed and makes the camera a wonderful tool.  I wouldn't consider buying any of the Pens unless I budgeted for the finder as well.Bottom line?  Great camera for the money.  Just make sure you are buying it for the right reasons.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "A seriously good camera for its niche", "Author": "Michael McKee \"mystic cowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R1C0RNFBBV7HS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am quite surprised at how good the images are that I'm getting, especially jpegs. I'm used to shooting raw because I get better files and can squeeze a bit more juicy goodness out of my photos that in-camera jpeg processing does. Surprisingly, this camera does a great job with jpegs in good light situations. That's the important idea to keep in mind, good light. Kirk Tuck gives this camera a fine review, but realize that he's a lighting pro, who has written several (good) books on the subject.IMO this camera is targeted toward two markets. For those moving up from a point and shoot, it's wonderful. It's familiar and less intimidating than an SLR. It can create better images than even the best point and shoots. The price is reasonable. It's attractive and it's a lot lighter than an SLR. Those people wouldn't consider shooting in bad light without a flash. They wouldn't consider deliberate long exposures to smooth motion effects. Those last two areas are not the camera's strengths as Brad R. points out. From the things he's asking the camera to do and not getting satisfaction he is a more knowledgeable photographer and demands more than the main target market for this camera. If you want low light capability or low ISO speed then this isn't the best camera around, though it isn't that bad, either.The other market is more experienced photographers looking for a light and compact second or third camera. They have cameras for low light or fast action shooting. But there are reasons for not carrying around a big, heavy, professional looking camera but still wanting quality image files. That's my reason. My aging back hurts lugging around a fully sealed and rugged SLR. I've also found that I've been questioned about photos when in many tourist places: No pros allowed. Pros need to pay a fee. I don't want a reporter taking my picture. Guess what? The EP-2 doesn't get that kind of response. It looks like a tourist camera and tourists aren't as intimidating as professional looking photographers, pro or not. Stick a big camera with vertical grip in a room and people tense up. Hold your camera a foot in front of your face and few people care. I love that about this camera. I guess you can tell that I like street photography with it.How much do I like it? A lot. It's tolerably light, fits in a smallish fanny pack. handles great, takes great photos in good light, has well though out controls, and works fine with flash systems. Will I be shooting at night with this for available light? No. Is it a great camera for portability? Absolutely. It's light. Its lenses are lighter than any larger sensor camera's. I can take excellent quality images when I work with rather than against the camera. All in all I very pleased.The other nice thing about this camera is that it will take accessories and a remote shutter release. You can, and probably should add the attachable viewfinder. It will also take external microphones, which helps with much higher audio when recording video. That sounds strange, but it's true. As a video camera, it's pretty equivalent to current entry level SLRs.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ideal size, easy to grip, great image quality", "Author": "Richard Sanders", "ReviewID": "RNWAYCWQB8X9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used the Oly Pen e-PL2 for over a month now (update: over 6 months) and I like it very much. I'm going to try to highlight some of its best features and also recommend some very useful accessories. And I'd also like to show you how to navigate quickly while avoiding unnecessary problems. My review will be long and detailed but will ultimately save you time. I'm a pro fine-art photographer (Dick Sanders) and I shoot medium format film cameras for \"the look,\" but I have numerous other photo needs, and I found myself using my Nikon F100 film camera for everyday apps, which was inconvenient. I didn't want to buy a bulky DSLR for non-pro work, but I also didn't want (even the best) point-and-shoot camera with its tiny sensor. The Oly Pen e-PL2 gives you a quality four-thirds sensor in the ideal body size. And because it has both a front grip and a rear thumb rest, it's easy to hold and shoot, even with one hand. Granted, the Oly is not pocketable (except for a large jacket pocket), but that's not important to me, especially after getting the perfect case, the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 (more on this great case just ahead).A great feature right off the bat is that the Oly e-PL2 comes with a 100 page printed English manual (see page references for various features ahead). It also has a CD ROM with a detailed manual, but I haven't found a need for it. The camera has vast capabilities and can seem daunting at first with so many menus and choices, so expect to spend several hours with the manual and camera exploring, but this is fun and you can customize the settings for your preferences. Before buying this camera, I had read a couple of reviews in which the users said the camera had confusing menus and difficult navigation, but this is not true. Spend a little time with it, and you'll see that it's actually quite logical, and while there are many choices, once you learn what you want to do, you can do those things pretty quickly. There is a small dial that you can spin to navigate and make changes, and some people complained about it being too sensitive (it is), but you don't even have to use it, as there are arrow buttons as well. I find the arrow buttons plenty fast and rarely use the dial, but it is handy for \"more quickly\" scrolling through pics during review.In any case, right out of the box, I found I could use the iAuto and get beautiful photos effortlessly (see my sample pictures here of a white rose and my white cat). The large-fine jpg files (be sure to set it for that, pg 42) open at 10.08 by 13.44 inches at 300 dpi, and the quality and colors, even with the kit lens, are very good. With today's high quality enlarging plug-ins for PhotoShop (I use OnOne Software) you can easily enlarge the 10.08 x 13.44 to 30 x 40 inches and get very good results, but mostly I wanted this camera for 5x7s, 8x10s and the occasional 11x14 (and of course for various online pics). I prefer the 4/3 format over the others, because it easily makes 5x7s, 8x10s and 11x14s with minimal cropping. But you can also change to other formats, including 3:2, 16:9 and 6:6, although it'll crop the full 4032 x 3024 sensor accordingly. By the way, I think it's important to note you're getting 12 megapixels on a fairly large four-thirds sensor, which is the reason for the good image quality. Typical P&S; cameras cram 12, 14, and even 16 megapixels onto tiny sensors and that's a recipe for poor quality.Right off, I took a picture handheld in my living room on iAuto, at ISO 1600 and a 1/15 second shutter speed, and with the image stabilization, the picture was sharp, with natural colors (just slightly warm), and no visible noise in an 8x10 print. It was quite good right out of the camera, and I made minimal PhotoShop adjustments to make it perfect. Anyone can use this camera on iAuto and the results out of the camera will be very good and ready to use. Some noise was visible in the shadow areas of my living-room photo if blown up larger, but a quality noise reduction program would take that out. So, there is probably no \"general need\" for the external FL-36 flash, which I bought with a bounce-diffuser then returned (the camera does have a pop-up and tiltable built-in flash and more on that just ahead). In low available light I can shoot at 1600 and print up to 8x10, and probably larger with a noise reduction tool such as Nik Dfine or the one in Lightroom.If you're a novice or moving up from a P&S;, this is a great camera because you can start on iAuto and always revert to it in an emergency. If you press some buttons that take you somewhere you don't want to be, all you have to do is press the menu button twice and you'll be instantly returned to the basic iAuto shooting mode -- a lifesaver when you need to act fast to get the shot (my wife likes this feature). Another great feature is the \"Live Guide\" which is quickly accessed in iAuto by pressing the central OK button (pg 18) and from there you can make the scene lighter or darker, warmer or cooler in color, more or less saturated in color, and also change the depth of field (blur the background). You'll see your adjustments live on screen. Making the color temp a little cooler indoors without flash is usually necessary, but Oly makes it easy. And because you see exactly what you're getting as you make the changes, the Live Guide is of immense value. Also, if you get deep into the menus and feel lost, Oly prompts you how to \"go back\" and also labels or explains everything on screen (very helpful in the beginning). And then as you learn more, you can begin to use more functions and choose your settings. But I should warn you that this is not a camera to hand off to somebody at a restaurant for a group photo. There are several small buttons on the back that do different things. Your thumb definitely needs to go on the thumb rest. When I handed the camera to a person who volunteered to take our picture, he accidentally pressed a couple of buttons and somehow got night mode with a long exposure and flash and the pics were worthless, but this was my mistake.Another feature that's easy to access is exposure compensation, which I've used all my photo life, and I like that I can access and change it quickly in Program, Aperture or Shutter Priority (pg 36). The same is true with adjusting white balance (38) or changing ISO (43). There is also a manual mode, but I haven't found a need for that yet. There's a movie mode, too, and the movie button is positioned just to the right of the thumb rest, so you can hit it easily to start filming. But you can also trigger it accidentally. Since I have a good quality Canon Camcorder I customized my Oly to disable the movie button, and the advantage here is that you can assign this button another function (pg 84) and still make movies by turning the mode dial to \"movie.\" The camera has six push-button art filters. I'm not a fan of digital gimmicks, and I see many photos today that are over HDR'ed or otherwise hyped and made ridiculous, but I confess I found the art filters, including pinhole, grainy black and white, and especially the dramatic tone to be fun, and you can even combine these effects in multiple exposures (pg 51). The dramatic tone gives you a pseudo HDR look and it's a bit over the top, but I found I could dial the effect back in Photoshop and make a dramatic and interesting photo that looked only slightly unrealistic, and for some pictures -- for example, flowers against a sky with clouds -- the results were improved without looking terribly unnatural. The effects you get with sky and clouds are especially good here. I also got some funny pics of my cat with the pinhole filter, so there are definite uses. The grainy black and white is a little too contrasty for my liking, but I can remember when such a look was popular in the 1960s (think high-key fashion or gritty rock documentary). There is also diorama, for a miniaturization effect, plus pop art for dramatically hyped colors, and soft focus for portraits or dreamy effects. In addition, there are about 20 different \"scene modes,\" including panorama (pg 50) for stitching several photos together. Basically, this camera is good for novice to pro. It'll do a lot for you, or you can do a lot with it, or you can limit what you do. Let's face it, you'll mostly use 5, 6 or 7 favorite things, which you'll learn to access and use fairly quickly. The other 101 things the camera will do can be ignored or serve as fodder for experimentation. And you can also use the MYSET feature, which will give you your favorite settings as the default (see page 31).Unfortunately, the camera does not focus well in very low light and there is no focus assist lamp (Olympus, please add this for the e-PL3 -- Jan 2012 update -- Olympus has disappointed with the e-PL3; while they did add a focus-assist lamp, they made the camera smaller and ditched the grip, making it much harder to hold. They did add a tilt LCD, which is good for low angle shots, but not fully articulating so you can't do self-portraits, and then they raised the price. They did improve the back control layout some, but if you're buying the e-PL3 you will need to buy an accessory grip that you can attach to it, otherwise you'll never be able to hold it with one hand: Google Richard Franiec grip for Olympus Pen e-PL3). I don't think the hotshoe FL-36 flash unit provides the focus-assist beam feature, either. But you can customize the fn button to toggle between manual and autofocus (pg 33) so in low light you can hit the fn button, zoom in, focus manually, then zoom back out to get the shot. There's also a way to hit a couple of buttons for a quick zoom-in for close focusing, but I found it faster to manually zoom in and focus. Of course, in the old days we all did this just fine. Sadly, autofocus has made us lazy and I can say it's let me down on many occasions. But if you're dealing with a really dark scene, you can also set the screen brighter (pg 75), and then zoom in and manually focus, so there are good workarounds here. On tiny P&S; cameras, you have little buttons or levers that make zooming slow or awkward, but here you just grab the lens, twist, and you're there. Zooming and manual focusing is fast and easy. Of course, you can choose the focus mode and target (pgs 32-33), and you can customize buttons for focus and exposure lock (pg 83). I like to use a central target which locks when the shutter button is depressed halfway, then I recompose and shoot. But for portraits, you can set the camera on face detection with \"closest eye detection,\" and it'll track focus on a moving face, which is good for pics of your kids (it even worked on my cat) or just when you want the focus on your subject's eyes. I will definitely use this feature, especially with the Panasonic/Leica 45mm lens (90 macro) which I intend to buy next along with the Panasonic 20mm f1.7. But I've been using the 14-42 kit lens with good results, and I like that it focuses to 9 inches, which at the full zoom 42 (84) gives you big closeups.Two must-have accessories in my opinion are a 37mm to 46mm step-up ring and the B&W; brand 46mm collapsible rubber lens hood. This combo will attach to the 37mm threaded kit lens, and with the rubber lens hood in the collapsed position it'll work very well for 14 to 17.5mm (28-35) and in the full extended position from 17.5 to 42 (35-84). The B&W; 46mm two-position rubber lens hood is much more practical than a fixed hard lenshood and is really helpful outdoors. Also, this 46mm lenshood will fit and work well on the Panasonic/Leica 45mm f2.8 macro lens (90mm), as well as the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 pancake lens (40mm). Now, if you add a 46mm filter to the step-up ring-lenshood combo, you'll get a little corner vignetting at 14-17.5mm, but none thereafter. But the step-up ring and lenshood offer protection for the lens, so you can go without a filter, unless you specifically need one for special effects (ND filter, for instance). I do use a 37mm UV filter on the camera when indoors for general lens protection. And I have a 46 UV filter I use outdoors sometimes, but I must remove either it or the lenshood for 14 to 17.5 wide angle, unless using the 16:9 format, in which case the corner vignetting isn't an issue. Note: I want to use the 46mm filter and lenshood with the Panasonic/Leica 45 and 20 lenses (both threaded for 46mm), otherwise I could get a 37 to 52 step-up ring, 52mm filter, and B&W; 52 rubber lenshood and there would be no vignetting whatsoever. This is an option if you know you're only going to use the 14-42 kit lens, and in such case you can even get a very thin 52mm filter. Another advantage of the B&W; lenshood is that if you're wearing the camera around your neck, and you stoop down and the camera swings out in front of you and bangs something (while hiking, for instance) the rubber lenshood offers good protection, which is why I prefer collapsible rubber lenshoods for all my lenses including those for my big film cameras.The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 camera bag is a perfect small bag for this camera. It'll hold the e-PL2 in the main section with some extra room, and it'll hold the 37 to 46 step-up ring, 46mm filter, and 46mm B&W; lenshood (combined and ready to use) in the front pouch. The front pouch also has two small compartments that can hold two extra BLS-5 batteries (a good idea since the battery life is a little short) and/or more SDHC cards. You can also fit an SDHC card on either side of the bag behind the shoulder-strap rings (nice design touch). You'll find that for a long day of heavy shooting, or a 3-day travel weekend, carrying 2 extra batteries is a good idea. And you can now get an off-brand BLS-5 battery at Amazon for a very reasonable price. By the way, since I'm not shooting HD movies, I bought the Delkin 4 gb Pro Class 10 SDHC card for this camera and it works great and holds over 500 pics, unless you're shooting raw. Raw and movie shooters should get the 8gb class 10 SDHC card. And if you're going to get serious with raw, you should know the raw converter Oly provides isn't very good. Lightroom is much better, and the 3.4 upgrade will convert the raw Olympus .orf files, and it also has the noise-reduction feature. But back to the case -- in the main section of the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 case, you can put the Panasonic/Leica 45mm macro lens at the bottom and the Oly e-PL2 on top, and the lid will still close. You can also put the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 pancake lens in the front pouch, if you don't use it for the lenshood, in which case that will easily fit with the camera in the main section and can be left on the camera. It just depends what you're buying and how you want to use the case. But this is a high quality, small, lightweight bag with both a top handle and adjustable shoulder strap, which can be made long enough to swing the bag comfortably behind your back. It has a secure quick release latch on the front which is also adjustable to make both the lid taller and the front pouch bigger. This is ideal if you're carrying the camera with two extra lenses, 2 batteries, and the \"step-up ring, filter, lenshood combo.\" And if you're carrying less you can tighten the strap and shrink the bag. You can also remove the shoulder strap and attach this case to your belt. It'll be a little bulky that way, but the back of the bag features a quick-release velcro patch with safety snap that is so secure you can comfortably rest your arm on the bag. And to top all, the bag is even bargain-priced for its high quality. Whatever you do, don't buy the Olympus Pen casual case because it was made for the eP1, eP2, and e-PL1, all of which are slightly smaller than the e-PL2 (although I understand it will work for the e-PL2 with the Panasonic 20mm or Oly 17mm attached).The 3 inch LCD screen is of good quality (460k dot) and after a month's use I don't have a single scratch on it. It's also adjustable in brightness, and you'll find it easy to zoom in and move around to check focus. But you'll be surprised at how much better your pictures look when you open them in PhotoShop. I can't stress this too much -- the quality and colors right out of the camera are very good. So, if you're a beginner who doesn't have good PhotoShop skills, you need not worry. You can shoot on iAuto, make quick adjustments with the Live Guide (pgs 18-19), and you'll get great pics right out of the camera, ready for Flickr or Facebook or instant printing. The same goes for the art filters and scene modes, all easy to use. And as you learn more about photography, you can start to set your aperture, shutter speed, ISO, exposure and flash compensation, color temperature, shadow-highlight balance (pg 36), etc. You can really grow with this camera. In my own case, after a lifetime of photography, it gives me all of the options I want and many more. If it has any weaknesses, it would be sports action and low light work where you need quick and accurate focus. In both cases you'll need a DSLR.The built-in flash is surprisingly powerful, but I try to avoid it, since you just get that \"blasted flash look.\" But because it's fairly strong, adjustable in intensity (pg 55), and can be tilted up, I'm going to see if I can rig up a mini bounce-diffuser for it. Also, because of the tilt-up feature, you can bounce it off a \"low white ceiling\" and get improved results. Don't try it on a very high or dark ceiling. UPDATE: I did succeed in fashioning a mini bounce diffuser out of white construction paper, modeled on the Lumiquest Promax Pocket Bouncer, and it worked quite well to soften the flash but only at fairly close distances. Of course this is when the straight flash is the worst, so this is an option when you need more light and don't want it to look harsh. For sure, there's an advantage to using the pop-up flash outdoors in the shade, in a backlit situation, or at dusk as fill flash, especially since it's adjustable and you can dial it down for a more natural look. But if you do, you'll have to remove your B&W; lenshood, as it will block some of the flash. By the way, you can customize your Oly to synchronize the exposure compensation with the flash intensity, so these will work in tandem if you prefer this arrangement (pg 55).Regarding HDR, which is both very popular and overused today, there is a practical use for it that even Ansel Adams (the inventor of extended dynamic range with his Zone System) would likely approve, and that's to shoot in Raw, take 3 images -- one exposed normally, one underexposed, and one overexposed (a tripod will be needed here) -- and then combine all three in camera as a single image. In post processing, you can then create a realistic photo with an extended range that shows more detail in the highlights and shadows. In the instruction manual, look up RAW plus Overlay (pg 51 and also 63).I like the four-thirds format because the quality is very good and it's an open format, so you can use both the Panasonic/Leica lenses and the Oly lenses, and myriad other lenses with adapters, and very likely more lenses will be coming. I'm excited about trying the Panasonic Leica 45 and 20 micro four-thirds lenses (90mm and 40mm respectively) because these lenses have pro quality. And specifically the 20mm f1.7 is ideal for low light work. If you plan on doing a lot of indoor shooting and don't want to use the flash, this lens can be very helpful. I have a friend, also a pro street photographer, who uses the Olympus 11-22 f2.8-3.5 ED four thirds lens on this camera with an adapter, and he routinely produces excellent results. In fact, I've noticed a few have said that this is a great street camera, since it's neither obvious nor intimidating. UPDATE: Panasonic has just come out with a new Leica 25mm f1.4 aspherical lens that could prove to be the best lens yet for this camera. This \"normal perspective\" prime lens (50mm equivalent on full frame) will also be excellent for low-light work, and is just long enough to also work for portraits. Conveniently, it also has a 46mm filter/hood thread.I should mention this camera feels solid. It's got a little weight, which I prefer, and you get the sense of a fine piece of equipment, and yet it's smaller, lighter and more comfortable to carry and use than a DSLR. One important thing, because of the front grip and rear thumb rest, you can shoot this camera with one hand, which will allow you to do something else with the other hand. Believe me, this is absolutely necessary sometimes. For example, you can use your hand to shade the LCD screen so you can see what's on it outdoors in bright light (unless you're buying the hotshoe viewfinder). Or you can shade the lens, when you need to remove the lenshood. I once used my left hand with spread fingers to create dappled sun/shade falling on a white rose (see it in sample photos here). And sometimes I use my left hand to hold a 22 inch Photoflex translucent litedisc above a small subject to diffuse the sunlight (creates soft light), which is a miniature version of what pros do on location. On Amazon, look up Photoflex Translucent Lightdisc, and you'll see 12, 22, 32, 42, and even 52 inch circular sizes. The 22 and 32 sizes are practical for holding with one arm. These discs also come as dual-sided reflectors for reflecting white, silver, or gold light, so pay attention to what you're ordering.A few people complained about the quality of the kit lens, as if they expected pro quality. Why? I find the kit lens to be quite good, but I don't expect pro results from it; that's why I'm adding the Panasonic/Leica 45mm f2.8 and 20mm f1.7 lenses. One person said the pictures were washed out. Really? In some cases, I've had to slightly reduce the color saturation, but you can also set the camera for vivid, natural, muted, monotone, etc (see pgs 40 and 41). Or in iAuto, press OK for Live Guide and adjust \"color saturation.\" Remember, the color tone, saturation, and white balance are all adjustable. You can even choose the exact color temperature (pg 38). One person said the pictures came out with a yellowish cast in iAuto indoors with no flash. Sure, that's common because of tungsten or mixed lighting or even the color of the walls. But the fix is easy: In the iAuto mode, press the OK button to get Live Guide, then choose \"color image\" and make the color cooler (pages 18-19). Or under Program, Aperture or Shutter Priority, press OK for Live Control, then toggle up to WB and select \"incandescent,\" which will balance the color temperature to your indoor lights (pg 38). Even if you have your Oly set for \"auto white balance,\" there's a white-balance compensation feature for fine-tuning the color (pg 39). And you'll see all of the adjustments I've described above \"live\" on screen. Another person said the camera was signaling it was in focus when it wasn't, but I wonder if he failed to choose a \"default focus target.\" If you don't select a target (pgs 33 and 77), the camera will choose one of 11 targets for you, which obviously will often be wrong. And here's something that will save you time: in iAuto, the camera wants to choose a focus target for you (a face if you have it set on face detection) but if you want to choose your own target, simply press the [...] button (note: that's not deleted copy, the symbol is three dots) and select from a grid of 11 targets and press OK. But if you switch from iAuto to use Program, Aperture or Shutter Priority, and then back to iAuto, the camera will revert back to choosing its own target, and you'll have to press the [...] button and select your target again (a 3 second manuever). Remember this and you'll avoid aggravation and lost shots. In any case, why send the camera back because you're unwilling to read the manual and learn how to press two buttons? I just don't find these complaints realistic, unless the complainers got a bad copy (it does happen), in which case they should return their cameras for a refund and buy new ones.A cool feature for black-and-white shooters is that once you choose \"monotone\" under Picture Mode (pgs 40-41) you can go on to choose a filter, including neutral, yellow, orange, red, and green. The yellow filter will add a little contrast. The orange and red filters will add more contrast, making a blue sky darker and highlighting white clouds. The green filter will lighten green foliage and darken red objects and can accentuate facial features in portraits. The red filter will lighten red foliage and darken the sky. I like the orange filter for black and white landscapes that include sky and clouds, and sometimes red for maximum drama. You can also choose sepia, or add a slight bluish, purplish, or greenish cast. All useful effects.All in all this is a great camera, especially for its size, features, and fine quality at this price. I'd say you can't go wrong, unless you want fewer features, a smaller sized body, and are willing to sacrifice some image quality (the small Sony NEX excluded since it has an APS sensor). But I found the camera perfect for the myriad everyday apps I need, and it will also make an ideal travel camera. Well, that's about it. Sorry my review is so long, but I find that when I'm looking for new gear, the detailed reviews are more helpful. I hope I've answered some of your questions and also suggested some useful accessories.

It doesn't draw too much attention due to its size, styling and small lenses. The in-body image stabilization is fantastic as is the built in flash.  The flash is designed in a way that allows it to be bounced off the ceiling, allowing for a more natural look. The wireless flash support was a key seller for me...I don't have an olympus flash unit but plan on picking up the FL-36R for travel.  I have this camera with the kit 14-42 and a panasonic 20mm f/1.7.  The 14-42 is silent and is sharp, but the lens construction is on the cheap side and it is slow (in f-stop, not autofocus).  Autofocus is fantastic with both lenses and comparable to a GF1 in focusing speed.  I love the image quality and the high iso performance is pretty good; images are usable at ISO 1600.  The noise that is present has a film-like quality....Overall, this is a fantastic kit at a great price....its not going to replace my 7D for shooting motorsports or wildlife but it definitely does well in all other scenarios.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "E-PL2 Is On Par With A DSLR Plus A Ton of Funs To Use.", "Author": "Neo Lee", "ReviewID": "R1NN51SC8YB8N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought an Olympus PEN E-PL2 w/ kit lens and with a Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 lens separately last week and since then cannot let go of it. I take it everywhere I go, and I shoot everything, anything that moves and doesn't move, day and night, outdoor and indoor. The photos blow my mind away. Upon seeing photos, people are keen to ask what camera I use.* Portability *This camera is incredibly small, about half the size of an entry-level DSLR. It's about the size of a bridge camera except E-PL2 is thinner. It could not be slipped into a pocket, but it's so portable that I have no trouble taking it everywhere I go.* Low Profile *E-PL2 having such a classic low-profile design is a perfect quality camera for candid photography of kids and people who get intimidated by pro-looking DSLR. I don't know but people tend to get too serious when faced with professional camera gears. The purpose of candid photography isn't really to spy on them but to capture them in their most natural poses with genuine smiles. The retro-looking compact design seems to avert their attention away. People don't seem to mind having photos taken as much. When I'm out on the streets, this camera doesn't scream for attention. People won't stare at you. They won't come asking.* Image Quality *I find noises very acceptable up to ISO 1600. At ISO 3200, the noises get very noticeable although quite acceptable for general use in a family album, blog or Facebook. At its highest ISO, 6400, the image quality gets degraded so much you would have to be desperate to use it.E-PL2 reigns supreme in blurring out the background, isolating the subjects. Ideal photos that look awesome define where the eyes should look at, by giving tack sharp focus on where it matters the most. This would be incredibly difficult to achieve with a typical compact, as everything is always in focus. Not that you can't shoot great photos with a P&S; compact, but E-PL2 opens up a new dimension to photographers, a dimension that allows the viewers to visualize depth in 2D photos.* Night and Indoor Photography *E-PL2 performs wonderfully in low light. I find I'm able to shoot away at ISO 1600 at night and at ISO 800 indoor with a few bright lights. The photos are very acceptable.The noise sensitivity is almost on par with an entry-level DSLR (such as Canon Rebel T3i or Nikon D5000). E-PL2 has a 4/3 sensor with an area of 200mm\u00b2 when cropped to 3:2 aspect ratio. That is about 55% of 370mm\u00b2 area of an APS-C sensor inside a modern crop DSLR, and in comparison, E-PL2 sensor gets only about half the amount of light at the same shutter speeds. To make up for the loss of light, Olympus makes a design change. Firstly, the pixel density of E-PL2 in 3:2 aspect ratio is reduced to 10MP from 15-18MP of a typical DSLR. Lowering the pixel density gives space to making larger photodiodes on the sensor which allows more light collection per pixel. The reduction of the megapixels keep signal amplification power only marginally higher, and that will lead to only a slight increase of grainy noises in the photos.E-PL2 sensor may be smaller than that of a DSLR's APS-C sensor, but it is still five to nine times the size of  sensors found in typical compacts. As the larger E-PL2 sensor gathers much more light, E-PL2 will have considerably less noises. It matters a lot whenever it goes dark.* Built-in Flash *The built-in flash is conceptually new in a way that you pop it up and can hold it upright to bounce the flash off the ceiling, and it works pretty good too, granted that the ceiling is not too high. You should however expect to get an external flashgun for the job if you're serious in getting plenty of light on the subjects.For night portraits, I usually underexpose the flash by two stops (by setting the FEC to -2). By underexposing the flash, the camera will use the available ambient light as the primary/key light, and a bit of flash will fill in the shadows and lighten up the faces, giving a more natural look.* Sensor-shift Image Stabilization *For handheld shots, E-PL2 sensor could shift to stabalize the shots by about two stops, even if the lens doesn't have IS.A few things you should note though. The sensor-shift IS works only for still photos and only during the exposure. It isn't activated when you press the shutter button half-way and when in movie mode (which is the standard behavior of lens-based IS).It is pretty loud but also such a beauty to observe a shifting sensor while shooting lensless.* Focus *It's a mirrorless that relies on contrast detection to focus on subjects, unlike DSLRs which have dedicated AF phase-detection sensors to do the job. While contrast-detection AF is generally slower and less acurate than the phase-detection AF, I find that E-PL2 focuses blazingly fast and accurate. In low light, the AF hits and misses (which is also an issue for phase-detection AF).* Conclusion *If you own a DSLR, you will find E-PL2 a great complement for fun and professional uses. It takes awesome photos in shallow depth of field and in low light. The real loss over a DSLR is the loss of pixel density but E-PL2's 10MP is good enough for large prints.UPDATE: 05/29/2011* Cons *After using for another month, some limitations are getting more apparent. Firstly, a video clip is limited to 2GB in size. Since E-PL2 records videos in the outdated Motion-JPEG format that consumes much higher bandwidth than the newer AVCHD/MP4, a clip can last only for 7 mins 30 secs. It however doesn't stop you from recording more clips till the card is filled up. Secondly, while ISO can be changed in the video mode, only ISO 400 to 1600 are selectable. I have no idea why the ISO 200 is not.* Issue *The issues apply particularly to this unit I bought. It might say something about the build quality.Apparently, after two months of use, the built-in flash went dead. It's probably a mintor electrical contact problem since it pops up and down like that. External flashgun still works with it though.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great, except for the red dots...", "Author": "Peter Chenoweth", "ReviewID": "R1QIKCXWDMO0S2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The E-PL2 was my first micro-four thirds camera and my first Olympus.  I've had a succession of Nikon DSLR's over the years, along with a rotation of higher-end compacts from most of the camera manufacturers.  I currently have a D90, and it's never let me down.  But I wanted something smaller and more portable but with better-than-P&S-IQ;, and the E-PL2 looked very promising.  I was really looking forward to it.  It is a great camera, and after a couple of hours of shooting I was even thinking that it might replace my D90 for all but the most demanding situations I encounter (very low light, very fast action, etc).  The E-PL2 is a fun camera to shoot with, and IQ up to ISO800 was nearly indistinguishable from the D90.  The Art filters offer a lot of creative potential.  Great!I was *thrilled* with E-PL2 until I shot a sunset and got home to review the results.  When I got home & viewed the photos on my Mac, I noticed a distracting grid of red dots around the sun in several of the shots.  It doesn't look like any kind of lens flare that I've ever seen in my 10 years of shooting digital.  It looks like some sort of internal reflection on the imager.  Thirty minutes of searching & reading, and apparently this is something of a known 'feature' of the E-PL2.  There's a lot of heated debate about it online; whether it's the camera, the photographer, incorrect composition, poor choices of aperture, lenses, etc.  I'd strongly encourage anyone considering this camera to read up on it.It isn't a problem for everyone, nor may it affect every E-PL2, but mine (with the latest v1.01 firmware) with the kit 14-42 II & 40-150 f4-5.6 lenses definitely had it.  It was visibly distracting on not out-of-the-ordinary photographs of a typical sunset.  IMHO, not acceptable from a camera of this price & caliber. I got up early the next day and shot some photos of the sunrise to see if it would happen again and to do some tinkering.  Sure enough, the red dots were there, and much worse this time.  It was a clear & bright sunrise, so that may have something to do with it.  I shot in iAuto, \"Sunset\" mode, P, A, and full manual.  Wide-open apertures do seem to lessen the problem, but it's still distracting to me.  Anything above about f8 and it's a real mess (which is what the \"Sunset\" mode wants to use...).So, with some sadness, I returned it.  Great camera, I just need one that can reliably capture a sunset.  I will keep my options open, and I'll eagerly await the \"E-PL3\" that will hopefully have this problem resolved.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "The \"Small\" System I've Been Looking For", "Author": "David L.", "ReviewID": "R38YTGRULY1F4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got into photography almost 3 years ago.  Took lots of pictures with various point & shoot cameras for many years before that but not really paid a whole lot of attention until said date when I purchased a DSLR and went on an oversea vacation.  That's when it changed from taking snap shots to a hobby.In the last couple years my young son started showing keen interest in photography particularly in close-ups of bugs and flowers.  I've been wanting to get another camera that's capable of macro and portraiture to complement what I have, something not as heavy or \"obvious\".  This Pen EPL2 fits the bill and is much smaller and lighter.  Photo quality wise, IMO it matches the DSLR in some regards and lags a little in others, partly a function of the accompanied lenses and how much I'm willing to spend to close the gap.  And partly my skill.  I love the skin tone it produces which is gorgeous and flattering.  Photo opportunity wise, the little guy sometimes surpasses due to its readiness and stealthy nature.Here are the lenses I use to maximize the varied styles of photography we enjoy:  a. Oly Kit 14-42 lens with Oly wide converter for general photography plus the occasional wide angle shots (to 11mm).  b. Oly 40-150 lens with Oly macro converter for telephoto and up to almost 1:1 macro on the long end.  This is sought after as I get to zoom during close-up framing.  c. Panny 20mm f1.7 for street photography and low light situations.  The 35mm equivalent focal length due to the 2x crop factor is 40mm, making it an ideal all around fast pancake.  Combined with the in-body image stabilization this is quite the app.  d. Oly 45mm f1.8 for portraiture and short telephoto.  This combination produces very sharp, luminous and detailed photos plus the great ability for shallow depth of field to give you the separation of in-and-out of focus subjects.  If you are curious, yes the bokeh is lovely.I'm delighted by the large selection of M43 lenses and accessories available.  Frankly with just one lens, you can do alot and some may argue that's all you need.  But I'm extremely happy with how far this system can take me today.  The camera itself looks retro, comes from the stellar Pen lineage, and is equipped with many manual adjustment buttons and dials which I like.  One of my favorite features is with the ease in which one can adjust exposure compensation + or - and see in real time what the photo will look like on the LCD before clicking the shutter.  Focus comes in Single or Continous, auto and auto/manual, as well as face recognition, plus get this: tracking.  Easy to capture the shot and stay in focus. The focus speed and accuracy are more than good enough for me.Another benefit is that all this equipment fits into a small/medium sized bag and combined weigh very little.  I can carry it for days and not get sore at all.  One negative is that at this point, Olympus only offers one external flash, and it's not very good.  But I guess newer and better ones will be coming.Finally, the HD video feature.  When the optional viewfinder is mounted, I can shoot video in a dark theatre without bothering patrons nearby as the bright LCD is recessed.  Both the HD video as well as the mono audio are quality stuff, especially in a pinch.  The 720P shown on my 25 inch monitor is very sharp.  I used the EPL2 and the Panasonic 20mm lens combination the other day for my daughter's ballet performance, and it turned out better than what I could ask for.  Until I get a dedicated camcorder with a large sensor, in most situations the EPL2 will do fine.  Did I mention it's discreet?  Highly recommend.--------------------Over Christmas I brought only this camera for a Disney trip, and it was perfect.  I still think that each the M43 and the DSLR formats has its pros and cons.  When it's time for a smaller outfit, this is really fantastic.  If I'm doing a photo shoot where I need the ultimate in photo quality and accessories, I'd stay with the DSLR.Finally added up the weight: the EPL2 body plus the 20mm f/1.7 lens combined weighs roughly 360g to 380g.  That is less than the weight of the Nikon 60mm prime lens alone at 435g, or close to the Tokina 35mm lens alone at 350g. That's really amazing if weight is a factor.Found here at Amazon on 2/28/12 a wonderful third party flash unit: Nissin Speedlite Di 466 FT Four Thirds Digital Flash for Olympus and Panasonic Cameras. Yippee!!------------It is July 2012 and I've sold the EPL2 and replaced it with the EP3.  EP3 has a metal body and wow that feels completely different, very solid hunk of a tool. Images are about the same, maybe just a tad better.  The overall speed is faster and the touch focus and shutter screen works nicely.  I love the PEN series.  I've sold a number of lenses in my pursuit to become more creative with photography and now have just 3 prime lenses:  Panasonic 14mm and 20mm, plus Olympus Four Third 50mm f2 Macro.  I have placed an order for the wide angle lens converter (part # DMW-GWC1) for the 14mm which will bring the FOV to 11mm for more dramatic view.  We'll see how it works out.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great mirrorless camera", "Author": "Laurentiu Cristofor", "ReviewID": "R3FW6IK31UG1EL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are two reasons you are looking at this camera:1) You have been using point and shoot compact cameras and want a camera that delivers better images2) You have been using higher end cameras but are looking at a micro four thirds camera to complement your existing kitIf reason (1) applies to you, then I'll be brief: the E-PL2 is going to provide you with the expected boost in image quality compared to any compact camera. It will provide quality similar to a DSLR in a slightly more compact package. Compared to a DSLR, what the E-PL2 is offering is a slightly easier learning curve and simpler controls. So get it, use it, and read the manual when you have time so that you can learn more of the things you can do with this camera. Also, keep in mind that this is not a DSLR, it is a representative of a new market segment that sits between point and shoot compact cameras and DSLRs - it is called mirrorless, because it differentiates itself from DSLRs by lacking a mirror and the optical viewfinder supported by it.If you are here for reason (2), then I'll be brief again: the E-PL2 is a very well built camera. Its main size advantage results from the elimination of the mirror - in other words, the most important reduction in size is in the thinness of the body. Width and height are not much smaller than a DSLR, but depth is about half that much. What this amounts to is that mirrorless cameras are generally not pocketable. If you want a pocketable camera, you should look at a compact model such as Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD or its successor, Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black). Or the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 12.1 MP Rugged/Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Orange) if you want a waterproof camera. Or maybe the Pentax Q 12.4 MP CMOS Sensor Kit with 8.5mm 1.9 AL [IF] Prime Lens and 3x Optical Zoom (White), if you want a camera system with multiple lens choices. I picked the E-PL2 because I like having in body image stabilization and also because the E-PL2 has the highest ISO performance of all Micro Four Thirds cameras, as tested by dxomark (even better than the newer E-P3 model). I also liked the Olympus styling to Panasonic's one - the kit lens, for example, is much smaller.Now for some general comments:I found the menus and controls of the E-PL2 to be easy to figure out. A few things were uncovered after reading the manual. For example, there is an important camera customization menu that is hidden out of the box, to keep the options less confusing. It can be unlocked in the initial menus, but you need to know about it, to do it in the first place. It allows enabling a manual focus assist mode that is extremely useful, as well as performing the pixel \"mapping function\" to avoid stuck pixels (don't use it without knowing what you are doing). There are a bunch of other settings too.Autofocus was fast and accurate. You can guide it to focus on a certain area in the frame. Manual focus is also surprisingly good, mainly because of the good quality of the LCD screen - even though it's just 460K pixels. I liked the small details around the design of the body (the small grip on the front, for example) as well as the design of the kit lens.The kit lens is quite good. It is supposed to be least sharp at long end, but I used it wide open at 42mm and I was very happy with the results. It is light and small. This is the second version, having a better build and, I assume, optical capabilities as well. The only disappointing thing is that a lens hood was not included.The body of the camera is very well built and all buttons work great. The only exception might be the rotating wheel around the D-pad - it is very easy to turn around inadvertently. On the other hand, the features attached to it are great - you can use it to cycle through images while zoomed into an area, which is very helpful when comparing the focusing accuracy of a burst of shots.The camera software (Olympus Viewer 2) works without glitches and it permits the upgrade of firmware in both body and lens.It might be interesting to note that a number of users are already complaining about newer PEN bodies as being less featured than the E-PL2.In conclusion,the E-PL2 is a greatly crafted photographic tool. It is not extremely compact, but you wouldn't want it to be so either. IQ is on par with APS DSLRs, so the E-PL2 can indeed replace a DSLR.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful images even at high ISO", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R2N98S1RFVM948", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very impressed with this camera. It exhibits no visible noise at ISO800 and still pleasantly looking photos at ISO1600 where it retains the color and contrast quite nicely even compared to entry-level DSLRs. IBIS is very effective, using shutter speed 1/5 is a breeze - no more blurry pictures in low light. Together with Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens E-PL2 can sustain even the most demanding low light conditions with no flash. WB presents are very accurate. Use AWB most of the time except for artificial light conditions - switch to \"incadecent\" and you're good (in rare cases \"fluorescent\"). No more yellow cast images. Metering is very accruate; you wouldn't need to make any exposure changes in most cases. The color rendition of this camera is similar to that of Canon's but does even better job with skin tones rendering. Great portrait camera. I've been using it for a few weeks now (bought it from B&H; Photo though) and, honestly, it doesn't even have a lot of cons to brag about. I don't shoot videos so I don't even know if it's good at all. The camera is great for P&S; folks who are not comfortable to do any tweakings - E-PL2 works right out the box just like P&S; delivering beautiful, professionally looking photos (just don't forget to switch WB from AWB to \"incadecent\" in artificial light to avoid yello cast). If you currently own Canon S95 or anothe rtop of the line P&S; - you've seen nothing yet. S95 doesn't even come close to breathtaking \"bokeh\" or \"out of focus\" backgrounds you can easily achieve with E-PL2 not to mention extremely sharp looking photos.

The bottom line is I'm extremely pleased. For me small size and light weight matters.  At the same time I need a fast CCD and lenses.  I was considering a high end compact when the Olympus PEN E-PL1 caught my eye in a store. I was not considering an interchangeable lens system until I saw the PEN. I did my research and ended up with the newer E-PL2.  Additionally I purchased the Zuiko Four Thirds 70 to 300mm zoom and the micro Four Thirds adapter ring.  I picked this lens over the micro Four Thirds 70-300mm because it is faster.The combination of the standard 14-43mm zoom with the 70-300 is great.  I don't miss the gap in between one bit.I have been a fan of Olympus Cameras for over a decade and this camera lives up to their high standards. Overall the camera is really great, allowing me to to control whatever I want to control. I have found the controls to be easy to learn, and with practice they do become intuitive.  The color and image quality are fabulous.My only negatives are the lack of a macro feature in the standard 14-42mm lens (Olympus offers an adapter lens) and the overall length of the 14-42 mm lens when it is in the unlocked position. It gets in the way when I am hiking and it gets smudged because it sticks out so far.I was concerned about the lack of a viewfinder, especially with the 70-300mm lens, but I have found the LCD screen to be adequate 90% of the time.  Yes it is very hard to see in bright sunlight but I quickly learned to look over the top of the camera to get pointed correctly,  then there is enough of an image to compose.  But if you can find the slightest shade the screen is very visible.  I  probably will eventually buy the add on electronic viewfinder, but I am doing fine without it for nowThe body and lens are rugged.  I carry the camera hiking and it is doing just fine even though it is already been knocked around a bit. Although it is all plastic, it does not feel flimsy and I like the lighter weight and the fact that scratches will not show.What I am especially pleased about is the speed of the CCD and lenses.  Most of my photography is in the woods in the early morning.  I have yet to find a time when the system has been challenged by low light.  I often step down the ISO and aperture and shoot at a lower shutter speed.  With the 14-42mm lens and the built in image stabilization, everything is nice and clear at 1/15th or 1/30th of a second.For transport I could not go with a shoulder strap type bag as it would interfere with my backpack. My whole kit: body with 14-42mm lens, 70-300mm lens, remote release etc. all fit into a 7.5\"x 4.5\" x 6.5\" belt mounted case and I don't notice the weight hiking.As I said at the beginning, I'm extremely pleased", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "A+.

Although this is a nice camera, I found many aspects of the camera to be somewhat disappointing. For example, it's kit 14-42mm kit lens was painfully slow in terms of autofocus, and sometimes wouldn't focus at all when the lighting conditions were less than optimal. There were many times I had missed out on photo opportunities because the lens couldn't focus fast enough.I also didn't like the overall design of the camera body on the E-PL1. It's grip was to small for my large hands, and as such never felt comfortable in use. It's smaller screen was also recessed, allowing for dirt and dust debris to get caught in the edges and make cleaning  it annoying.The screen on back having a half the resolution of the E-PL2 made it a requirement to buy a EVF. I often struggled in bright light to manually focus something sharp enough because of the poor screen on the E-PL1.So how did the E-PL2 compare? Well, in my opinion it's better in just about every regard.The E-PL2 has a revised kit lens that not only is as sharp as the previous model, but contains only one moving part, and this less likely to break. This design change also improved the focusing speed dramatically, in both well lit environments, as well as poorly lit environments.The body design was also much improved over the E-PL1 in my opinion. Although it's a little thicker, the new grip feels less awkward and instead more natural when shooting or  just holding the camera.The button layout seems more logically placed as well. The addition to a scroll wheel is a nice touch. I'll add kudos to Olympus for resisting any temptation to go with a touch screen design, I feel that this decision gives the E-PL2 a handed advantage over competition like the Panasonic DMC-GF2. Of course that's just my personal preference.The new screen on the E-PL2 is great. The higher resolution and size, make manually focusing so much easier. It's also much easier to use in brighter day light conditions, when compared to the E-PL1. I also love the fact that the screen isn't recessed into the body, it makes it much easier to clean smudges, or dust from it.I'm so happy with the performance of this camera and the image quality, I'd recommend it over many entry level DSLR's I've used over the years.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small camera that will surprise you", "Author": "savirien", "ReviewID": "RF5O7188AER33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera from amazon about a month ago in an effort to rekindle my photography hobby... it worked!

Not entirely unexpected with a kit zoom lens. I highly recommend picking up the Panasonic 20mm pancake for anything that requires a decent shutter speed in light comparable to a sunset or dimmer.My second complaint is that the neck strap included is a coarse woven nylon strap that feels like it wants to take my skin with it every time the camera shifts during basic walking.  If you plan on using this with a neck strap, look into a neoprene based strap.I chose the E-PL2 over the E-PL3 mainly because of body design.  The E-PL3 is just a smooth block that doesn't offer much in the way of grip; It's just not comfortable to hold something like that for any extended period of time.Overall, the E-PL2 is a pleasure to shoot with.  I find that I simply can't put it down.  If you're thinking about buying the Panasonic GF2 you should take that into consideration.  The GF2 is just boring, it feels too plain.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great IQ, fun to use and looks good", "Author": "Ronn Abueg \"Ronnbot\"", "ReviewID": "R13UAP56A2D9DX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been using mine for almost a year (since Feb '11) and loving it. Friends and family (who are beginners and enthusiasts w/ D700/5DII) whom have tried and seen the results from my camera ended up buying/considering the same or similar m43 camera.As for the camera itself, the upgrades over the E-PL1, such as better LCD, scroll wheel, improved kit lens (14-42mm II) and redesigned body, increased the fun and usability factors. With the stuff (below) I've bought for use with the E-PL2, I think my set is pretty much complete:- Panasonic 20/1.7 - lowlight and 'normal' like (40mm equivalent) pancake lens for almost any situation- Olympus 45/1.8 - lowlight and portrait- Olympus 9-18 - UWA, also a good walk-around lens because it goes to 36mm equiv.- Olympus 40-150 - small and light tele zoom- Olympus VF-2 - bright, high-res EVF for better MF and usability during bright sunny days- Metz 50 AF-1 - powerful, full/wireless TTL, high-speed sync (up to 1/4000s) flash with upgradable firmware via USB- a bunch extra batteries (from 3rd-party manuf.)I can fit all of that in a small satchel, but I normally just bring the E-PL2 w/ the 9-18, 20/1.7, 45/1.8, and VF-2 with me.That said, the E-PL2 and kit lens alone are more than capable of producing great results. As kit lens go, the 14-42mm II is actually pretty good and is worth keeping. It is very sharp, and has fast and quiet AF. Unlike your typical DSLR kit lens (from Nikon/Canon), it is internally focusing, with non-rotating front element (good for polarizers) and have a decent focusing ring. Also, it is very small and light.The reason I picked this over competing mirrorless are...- IBIS (in-body image stabilization), so practically any lens I mount, including vintage SLR ones, are stabilized- hotshoe and built-in popup flash - NEX 3/5 don't have these- wireless trigger off camera flash with TTL from the built-in popup flash- m43 lens selection- accessory port to attach stuff like the high-res VF-2- expansive menu system and customization, so you can set the auto-iso range, reassign button functions, create presets, etc.- off camera JPEGs - less time doing PP = more time shootingFinally, some minor gripes:- proprietary usb- off center tripod- no AF assist lamp nor does it use the AF assist lamp on my flash- 720p only and no efficient video encodingIt should be noted that the E-PL2 (and other CSC) is not meant to be pocketable like a P&S; although I routinely put mine in a coat pocket. But, the E-PL2 plus a couple m43 lenses are very portable indeed; way more than a comparable DSLR + lenses. You will always have this with you and you wouldn't attract much attention to yourself since you aren't pointing a bazooka at people. Not only that, you don't need to get a big camera bag, heavier tripod, larger lens filters - basically more expensive accessories that you normally would with a DSLR as the entire system is smaller.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent image quality, reasonably good ergonomics", "Author": "Joseph L.

Sharpness is outstanding with excellent lenses and noise is reasonably well controlled up to ISO 800.  If you do a comparison with the DPReview RAW image comparison widget, you'll see that noise and sharpness are very similar to the Canon 7D up to ISO 800 or better, but in a much smaller, lighter package costs only 1/3 the price.  The 7D is superior to the E-PL2 in some areas, but low to medium ISO image quality, cost, and compactness are not among them.There's no question that the E-PL2's ergonomics are not optimum for the enthusiast user but they're more than adequate in the hands of someone with a reasonable amount of photo knowledge.  The convoluted menu system is certainly among the areas that the E-PL2, and all Olympus cameras, fall short of the best.  (Canon's shooting menu accessed by the center OK button is far superior in that regard.)The E-PL2 and E-PL1 are very suitable for casual users.  The green full auto mode setting produces, on average, some of the best JPEG files that you'll find without the need for much user input.  It's easy for highly knowledgeable photographers to sneer at less sophisticated users but's that not only mean but short-sighted.  Any camera that can produce good large sensor RAW images for knowledgeable users yet capable of good results by novices is a good camera.The revised 14-42mm Mark II lens is definitely sharper in my own use than almost any other kit lens that I've used or reviewed, especially at the usually troublesome wide angle settings.  Check out the review of this lens at[..] for a quantifiable evaluation.Two of the prime benefits of any PEN series Micro Four Thirds are the in-camera image stabilization and the ability to mount other lenses while retaining full autofocus and auto exposure functionality.  As a result, you can use some of the very reasonably priced and truly excellent Olympus Four-Thirds lenses (35mm/f3.5 and 50mm/f2 ) via Olympus's MMF-2 adapter.  You can also use the excellent Panasonic Micro Four Thirds 20mm/f 1/7 prime lens while retaining full image stabilization (something that's not even possible when that same Panasonic lens is mounted on a Panasonic camera!)I bought the E-PL2 with the two lens kit that includes a lightweight 40-150mm telephoto zoom.  The included MN.Zuiko telephoto zoom is compact and sharp enough, but the older ED Zuiko 40-150mm zoom, which can be used on this Micro Four-Thirds camera via the MMF-2 adapter, is sharper.  Sadly, the older ED lens and adapter kit, which was a fabulous value when selling for under $200 including the $130 MMF-2 adapter, is now substantially more expensive and no longer nearly as good a value.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great transition!", "Author": "Jane", "ReviewID": "R2YRD4CP66IN9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm coming from the bridge cameras that have been popular lately, point and shoot cameras with settings and options like DLSRs- with better picture quality and bigger sensors but low price tags and no lens options.I've had this Olympus Pen E-PL2 for about a week now and I love it.  The picture quality and color vibrancy is wonderful, and I am having those covetable DLSR photos without reading the manual completely.  I've barely touched it, and I realize that the intuitiveness of changing options is very good.  The autofocus is wonderful.  WONDERFUL.  Spot focus?  Wonderful!There's even an option for those of us who are afraid to change some settings that simplifies the process.. options like a bar with blurry background on one side and full focus on the other.  There are art filters, and scene filters that take the guesswork out of creating good looking photos.The lens kit the camera comes with is not bad.  It doesn't operate spectacularly in low light, so I am going to purchase the Panasonic 20mm and the Oly 45mm.  Since this is my first \"real\" camera, the lens seem especially pricy for me, but I'm aware that in order to have great photos in all situations and great speed I will have to get these lenses.The camera feels good in your hands and if you hold it like you used to hold cameras you'll find you don't even miss the viewfinder that isn't present.  I don't find the record button to be in the way of my natural hold, but I can see where if someone did hold their camera just a bit different it would be a problem.  I like the feel of it.  I -love- the feel of it.The included flash is pretty reasonable considering it's an attached flash.  You have to manually raise it even if you have the settings set to flash.  Flash intensity is easy to dial down, though I haven't found the option yet for timing the flash.  I suppose I'll have to pull that manual out after all.Again, I am no photographer- but I do enjoy taking good photos for posterity's sake and this camera fits the bill wonderfully.

Love the quality of its photos and the quality of the Olympus lenses. The Olympus FT system is slightly smaller and less expensive than other DSLR's of the same quality and speed. I have not owned a point and shoot camera in years although my wife gets some very fine shots with hers.As I added lenses to my FT system, the weight/bulk became considerable, especially on trips. So when the e-pl2 was released, I sold off my e620 and all but two of my FT lenses to buy a micro four thirds system.The e-pl2 adds features to the Penn line that earlier models needed, IMHO. I think it's the same sensor as the one used on my e30 with perhaps a more advanced jpg processor. I am well pleased with the camera for the reasons others have mentioned: small size, unobtrusiveness, quality lenses, quality of the photos, in-body image stabilization, etc.Every camera system is a compromise involving size, quality, and cost. I am quite happy with the size and quality of this system. As far as cost, you get what you pay for -- although I think Olympus charges too much for the lens hoods, which didn't come standard with any the mFT lenses, Olympus or Panasonic, that I have bought. Also the price of Olympus batteries is a bit much as well.For low light action shots (for me it's grandchildren at field sports or recitals, plays, important family parties, etc.) I still use my Olympus e30 and the 12-60 or 50-200 lenses, sometimes with a good flash. My e-pl2 with a zoom lens struggles in those conditions. For everything else I now use my micro four thirds system.The pen e-pl2 really needs the quality VF-2 viewfinder when shooting outdoors, especially when using the 14-150 or 75-300 zoom. I find I use the viewfinder most of the time for that reason and also for the added stability when shooting. Also, it's an excellent viewfinder; I don't find myself missing the view provided by my FT DSLR. With this viewfinder eyeglasses are not a problem.I have not used the 14-42 II kit lens much yet although I have been well pleased with the photos I have taken with it so far. I am very pleased with the Panasonic 14 and 20mm primes. Most of the time with those two lenses I don't need to use a flash in available light shooting. I could go around the world with the Panasonic 14mm, the 20mm, and the Olympus 14-150 although I would hate to leave the 9-18 behind. I am also quite satisfied with the Olympus 75-300 lens but that's more of an occasional shot lens and it does do best in good light.Unlike some critics above, I don't have any issues with the Olympus menu system and controls, probably because I was already familiar with them.You can get very good shots with this camera set to full automatic in good light situations. However, when the lighting gets tricky, it really helps to know how to make adjustments. Several good point and shoot cameras are quite adjustable as well so if one is moving from that type of camera to a micro four thirds camera, there shouldn't be much of a learning curve.This camera might not be good for someone who doesn't like to fuss at all before taking a picture.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than a DSLR and cheaper too.", "Author": "A G", "ReviewID": "R3DZ8SCHNSBDYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a long time comparing the reviews between this camera and some of the other DSLRs that came out at the time. Some of the review sites lets you compare identical images side by side from different cameras at the same ISO level and it always felt like this one came out sharper than any of the big names.  Maybe it's because it's mirrorless, or the anti-shake mechanism is built into the sensor instead of the lens, or some internal sharp-filter algorithm.  That's all up for debate and I don't know, I just know what I see. And if having a sharp photo is not your thing just widen the aperture to max and you can still get a very shallow depth of field and a pleasantly blurry background if you're taking portraits.This was also my first large sensor camera and in comparison my old compact cameras with their 1/2.3\" sensors just looked so grainy I got rid of them completely and just walk around with this in a small Case Logic carrying case about the size of my wife's Prada purse.Overall great camera and excellent low light performance, and if you are shooting in really low light just turn on the RAW+JPG format mode and make some minor adjustments in Adobe Lightroom.

Although the kit lens I hear is slower than the E-PL3, but at least it's faster that the E-PL1.some cons:- in dim/dark situations, with the kit lens, it does have a slow focus, and you can tell it's searching for the right focus.  I like to set the focus to Single - but allow Manual Adjustment, then I still have control to tweak the initial focus.- the video record button placement, i wish were closer in from the edge or on the top as it sometimes can be accidentally pressed, especially for self-portraits.pros:- picture quality is much better than my Panasonic ZS7 point and shoot, it just seems more dynamic, less flat.- the auto setting for the flash seems to do pretty good on it's own.  Adding the ability to tilt the flash helps when flash is needed.  It would have been nice if the flash would have been able to stay tilted, but it springs naturally back to forward.  I found zooming the lens to 25mm with the tilt flash looks the best as then you don't see as much of the lighting contrast.- the kit lens is collapsible.

The automode is absolutely fabulous and you can take very nice pictures, but using the same settings, as the automode, in the manual mode it is impossible to produce that same image colors or white balance.

My 4 star rating would be 5 stars because the camera does take some trial and error to use properly.  If someone is used to a Nikon DSLR with it's simple operating controls and functions, then the E-PL2 is going to frustrate them.  It's not a big clunky Nikon that everyone sees the pros using at weddings.  No.  It's a small(ish) and tech geeky sort of critter, and very fun to take with you whereever you may be going, instead of dragging the big monster Nikon with you.

Get the 45-150 lens and you will not be sorry, that's for sure.  I am adding a final point that I am now in process of selling off my E-PL2 in order to purchase an E-PL5 camera.  I will use the same lenses, but I really wanted the moveable rear viewing screen, not to mention that the E-PL5 is a step ahead in having a larger chip.

Very versatile and a great foundation for anyone looking to get into more manual control or as an excellent alternative to larger dSLR.I use this camera with the 14-42mm MKII kit lens, a Konica Hexanon 40mm f1.8 legacy lens, a Konica Hexanon 50mm f1.7 legacy lens, the Olympus VF-2 viewfinder, and a Metz 44AF strobe.  A great buy overall!!", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "E-PL2=A Good Time", "Author": "Zachary Wagner", "ReviewID": "R1MOKTSVTNH1O7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are just my initial thoughts about the E-PL2, which I have been using for about a week.  I will add to this as necessary.I gave this camera a 5 star rating, mainly because it's SO enjoyable to use.  There are a couple things that would keep it from being a 5 star camera, but those are overshadowed by the sheer enjoyment of its use.One of these things is the lack of an AF assist lamp for low light.  Contrast AF has a bit of trouble in lower light situations, forcing you to (at times) either aim at a light source to get the AF to work properly, or manual focus.  The XZ-1 offers an AF assist lamp... why not the E-PL2?  Seems like an easy thing to add to a body that's bigger than the XZ-1.  It would be a welcome addition, but the lack of it is by no means ruining the camera.Also, C-AF isn't great.  I'm not sure if this is a facet of the contrast detect system, but it's not all that useful in tracking moving subjects, at least in my limited trials.  Sure, you can use the tracking AF, but that can be slow and a little tedious.Shutter delay could also be improved just a bit.RAW processing time isn't great at all.  I could be wrong, but the XZ-1 seemed faster in this area.  Luckily, the jpegs look amazing, so I'll likely use RAW only sparingly.Other than these things, so far I LOVE this camera.  It's incredibly fun to travel around with, and I take it EVERYWHERE, which is something I never did with my D300s and all my lenses.  The kit lens is pretty good for what it is, has a decent range (could use just a bit more tele), reasonable macro, and is quite sharp.  AND it's tiny, which is one of the best things about this camera... the TINY lenses.I had the Oly 17mm 2.8 and returned it for the Pany 14mm 2.5, which so far I LOVE.  Very fast AF with this lens (which focuses internally), and it is sharper than the Oly.The sensor in this camera is stellar.  For what it is, it really excels.  IQ is very good from this camera, much better than the XZ-1 (which has much more noise at lower ISOs).  I do wish the ISO started at 100, and that the camera had a built-in ND filter like the XZ-1, which is simply an amazing tool to have.  I have ordered an ND filter for bright days (which happen all the time here in Albuquerque NM).The bevy of lenses available spans a pretty good range, though I think both Panasonic and Olympus could be offering more fast prime lenses.  Many of Olympus' lenses really aren't that fast... even their fast ones.  With a Panasonic 20mm 1.7 running around, you'd think Oly could have at least made their 17mm a 2.0.Minor complaints aside though, this thing is a joy.  It has literally inspired me to take more photos, and in many more (and varied) situations, than ever before.  LOVE the micro 4/3 system.  I hope they keep releasing great accessories and lenses for me to enjoy.(Update)  Well I've been using the camera for a while now, and I find that I love it more and more every day.  I now have the Oly 9-18mm and the Pana 20mm lenses for it, in addition to the kit lens.  ALL lenses perform very admirably.  The 20mm AF is a little slow, but the lens is very nice.  The 9-18mm is great, very fast focus, and really sharp, especially in the center.  And the kit lens?  That little thing is a wonder.  The focusing is fast and accurate, and it's bloody sharp for a kit lens.  One of the best kit lenses I've used.Okay, now for the bad.  I considered dropping the rating of this camera by a star, but figured it's not claiming to be great at this particular feature, so I'll leave it alone.  Getting pics of fast moving subjects is a chore.  More than a chore.  It's a frustrating experience.  Why?  Well, first the 3fps isn't stellar, but that's not really the main issue.  There are two real problems: One is the slideshow that happens in the evf while you're bursting (meaning you get to see each photo as it's taken, instead of just the continuing view of your subjects).  Now, this is an issue with most point and shoots (maybe all of them), so I can't knock the cam for it too much, but this camera being positioned as it is in the market, I would expect better.But the deal killer?  The continuous AF.  It sucks.  Bad.  I kid you not when I say it will move in and out of focus on a non-moving subject, so getting it to stick to one that's all over the place?  Forget it.  And the tracking AF is terrible as well, unless you've got one subject, moving relatively slowly.  I've resigned myself to using the single AF, and just being as opportunistic as possible, which as you can imagine yields pretty lackluster results most of the time.Does this ruin the camera?  Nope.  It's an amazing little piece of hardware, and the lens line is great, and just getting better (Oly is coming out with both a 12mm f2, 75mm 1.8, and a 60mm 2.8 macro).  Photos are pretty clean up to 800 (though a small amount of noise is visible as low as 400), and still usable at 1600.  3200 is pushing it.  But for a sensor smaller than APS-C, that's pretty great.  Colors are awesome and Oly jpeg processing is amazing.  There's a lot to like about this camera, and I think for what it is, it still deserves 5 stars.  But be clear- this camera is not for sports, and even grabs of your fast moving little ones and pets can prove to be a chore.

The SLR is too big, and the Leica is too expensive not to mention it's not user friendly to strangers.  The Olympus is not pocketable, however it's okay...I just put it in my purse or carry bag.  The camera is customizable so you can set it up for your preferences (nice). But right out of the box, I found I could use the iAuto and let the camera think for me, and I immediately produced beautiful photos effortlessly. Anyone can use this camera on iAuto and the results out of the camera will be very good and ready to use. Some noise was visible in the shadow areas of my living if blown up larger, but a noise reduction program would easily take that out.I use Elements or Aperture to process my photos, so no review about the included software.

It is a very well built nice looking camera, and felt substantial in my hands. I have been using both full-frame DSLR and compact cameras. E-PL2 is one of the new class of cameras that fills nicely in between. It is small, but not too small for holding with two hands. The sensor is smaller than full-frame but much bigger than ones in compacts, thus takes decent pictures under wider range of conditions. My compact camera has more pixels than E-PL2, but E-PL2 takes much smoother and realistic pictures. As the matter of fact, there is no comparison in terms of the picture quality.I do not use scene and art modes, or movie feature. So I do not know anything about them. I rarely use full automatic mode, because it disables controls I need, but my wife appreciate the convenience as well as the quality of the pictures it takes. We both like Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 on it so much, and we will probably not going to use the kit lens as much. The combination takes beautiful pictures. By the way, f/1.7 makes the rather weak built-in flash useful. Focus is on the slow side though.It took two days to set up the camera to my liking. Once set, the camera started working as I expected except for the white balance. I still need to pay attention to the white balance. I think it is too sensitive or over-compensating under compact FL and some other lighting conditions. I hope Olympus makes it right with a new firmware in the future. I need to either post-process each picture, or keep adjusting the white balance manually while I take pictures. That is a minor inconvenience to me though, and it is totally eclipsed by the fun I am having.I got Canon EF mount adapter and tried with 24-105mm, 16-35mm and 70-300mm EF lenses. Of course there is no AF, but the pictures are nice and so much fun. FLM of 2 makes 70-300mm a 140-600mm super telephoto. Not practical, but fun. $6 Zuiko CP filter works well. $49 Polaroid flash is compact enough and gives good amount of light and bounce, but manual mode or auto-focus assist lamp do not work with E-PL2. Still, $49 is reasonable.I should go get the view finder, super wide lens and telephoto zoom.

Cope \"Alan\"", "ReviewID": "RDDGQEUFFA1O0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to upgrade from my Panasonic DMC-FZ50 (a very good camera with a Leica designed lens). I did a lot of research. My criteria: higher quality pictures, which meant a larger processor, portability (if possible lighter than the Panasonic as most of my photography is on vacations and I did not want to lug around heavy equipment) and a good viewfinder (which meant ruling out cameras which only have LCD screens like the NEX5 - in daylight I find LCDs useless for serious photography). Some DSLRs are reasonably compact, like the Sony A55 or the small Pentax, but remember telephoto lenses are still big and heavy. So the field narrowed to micro four thirds cameras which have processors close to DLSRs in size but still remain easily portable although not pocketable. I ruled out the GH2 as too expensive and the G2 and others as still too large. I settled on the Pen EPL2 and have not been disappointed. Straight out of the box on automatic settings it takes great pictures. A not-too-critical family member recognized the improved picture quality right away.Purchasing the optional electronic viewfinder is a MUST (at $275 it is not cheap) but is really excellent. The LCD is no good outdoors. I am happy to forego the DSLR mirror view. The LCD cannot be tilted but the EVF can be rotated to 90 degrees to make it easire to take low down flower pictures.It usually takes me at least a year to get completely familiar with a new camera and I expect the EPL-2 will be the same, especially as the menu options are complicated and the manual is difficult to parse. I am waiting for \"EPL-2 for Dummies\" to be published. Meanwhile I will enjoy the great pictures using mainly automatic settings but will dock my rating a star for excessively complicated menus and a poor manual.

I held off buying serious digital camera until I felt they were good enough to equal or surpass 35mm film.  I had a couple small sensor SLRs and pretty soon ended up with a D700 for low light and a 5DII for everything else.  I never thought I could put up with the size and weight of these monsters but when I look at the images, man, its worth it.  Of course I still needed a pocket camera and through various Canons, Lumixes and Ricoh GRDs, I learned to live with the image quality in exchange for the small size.  But what if I could have both--a small, lightweight camera that produced images that were first rate in any situation and not too noticeably lower in quality than what my SLRs produce.  Well, not yet, I'm afraid.The new Pens and m4/3 in general have a lot going for them, both for the user who gets access to interchangeable lenses and the manufacturer who gets to sell interchangeable lenses.  My first impression of the photos was very positive but when I looked closer I saw very oversharpened jpegs (white line or halo around all edges) and with the sharpening turned down or with RAW, things looked a bit flat and soft.  Not terrible by any means and with Olympus' very punchy colors a casual user would probably be delighted.  The next step was to try a lens other than the kit lens.  I tried the Olympus 9-18 and the Panasonic 20mm.  The 9-18 was a little worse than the kit lens (but lots of fun) and the 20mm was a little better.  But still, the images still looked very similar to what I got from my tiny LX5.  Pretty good but not great.  Less noise with the Pen, of course, but still a lack of fine detail.  This is a subtle thing because you are literally looking for what isn't there but the fact remains.  Other Olympus models or Lumix m4/3 cameras may do better if they have a lighter anti-aliasing filter, which I have found really does make a big difference but that's another topic.I don't usually do these pros and cons but since they are so pronounced with this camera, I think it makes sense:Good:  Size, weight, price, ease of use, versatility, built-in stabilization, extensive menus with clear nomenclature, built-in flash with high elevation, kit lens is pretty sharp at 14mm end, extremely punchy color (if you like this), tons of lens options.Not so good:  Image quality a little better than much smaller cameras, LCD not visible with sun behind you, short battery life, fairly frequent difficulty focusing (or just slow), use of old lenses sounds like fun but in practice is rather awkward and they don't always perform that well (Olympus has a good explanation for this on their site).  If you accumulate enough lenses, add the electronic finder, etc, you have pretty much built a small SLR outfit--not a bad thing, but you're taking a long route to get there.So, if your current camera is an Elph, an LX3/LX5, Ricoh GR, S95, etc, run, do not walk to get a micro 4/3 camera.  You will see a definite increase in photo quality especially in low light.  If you have a lot of old lenses and like to experiment this is a fantastic, low-cost way to do so.  (Just $20 for an adapter!)  However, if your regular camera is a D90 or a 7D, let alone a full frame camera, be aware that you'll be giving up a lot in exchange for a m4/3 camera.  I know, everything looks great at 72dpi and with all the interest these cameras will certainly improve (more expensive ones are probably better right now).

Swope", "ReviewID": "R2YXXZAS08PQNH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read roughly a million reviews and looked at a broad range of cameras before purchasing this a few months ago.  I was looking to move up from a Lumix TZ1 which while fabulous for what it is, is quite old (at 7 years) and does not have high megapixel count or manual features.  I was looking for a tough combination of high image quality, a good macro and good zoom in a relatively inexpensive camera.My primary use for this is shooting art glass, a tough subject to capture well.I chose the Pl2 primarily because of its image quality.  The in-camera noise-reduction and availability of a mount which allows me to use my Minolta SLR RainbowImaging Minolta MD MC Mount Lens to Micro 4/3 Four Thirds System Camera Mount Adapter, Olympus PEN E-P1 E-P2, Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1, GH1, G1, MSRP USD24.99 is ultimately what sealed my decision.I find the camera easy to use in auto mode, and versatile in terms of options for manual control as well as special effects.  It is not, however, without its quirks and drawbacks.  i think if I had the option of playing with it for a few weeks before purchase I would have opted for something else (though not all of the issues became apparent immediately).  Count on missing a lot of shots.  Had I not purchased this primarily for shots of stationary objects I would have returned it immediately.1. This one is obvious out of the box: lag!  It takes longer for t5he shutter to reset than any camera I have ever owned, by a wide margin.  The shutter is also LOUD!  I actually find it cute in a nostalgic way, but it is not altogether a good thing.I hadn't considered the draw-backs of 9 focal points (most current cameras have a lot more) until i tried to take a picture of a flower in my garden, and... literally could not get it to focus on the flower!  The lighting was challenging because of the time of day, but... no matter how I moved, or moved the camera I could not get the flower in one of the focal points.  I have never had this issue with any camera I have used before, from cheap Poleroids to high end slrs, and many in between.My biggest issue (and I still have not figured out what went wrong) is it's losing pictures.I took it on vacation shortly after purchasing it, a trip where I went to visit family and then went on to a class.  On the first leg of my trip all of the pictures I had shot the prior week just disappeared.  I reluctantly reformatted the card, set up day, date... (which I had not done previously) and managed to get a handful of shots before I left.  The following day I spent at a museum, taking dozens of photos.  The following day they were all gone.  I weighed reformatting and losing whatever might still be on the card vs. not having it for class, and reluctantly reformatted again.  Over the course of the next week I shot hundreds of photos and some video, and once again it all disappeared :(  Not knowing whether the the problem was the camera or the card I hastily tried to replace lost shots on my last day, and to my surprise, they were all there when I got home (but were rushed and pretty awful photos).  It did, however, give me a chance to try the editing software it is packaged with, which is the best I have seen yet (in terms of software which ships with a camera), and which enabled me to save some of those awful shots ;)  Several months later, I have not had those issues again (the disappearing photos) and do not know what caused it, BUT still would have gotten something else just because of issues focusing where I want to.  It is very puzzling.  I have an inexpensive Lumix Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Screen LCD (Dark Blue) which allows me to focus via touchscreen, and which, in my experience, never misses.  Why is it so difficult to find a focal point on this camera?The software it ships with is terrific! It likely provides enough control in terms of editing that most people would not need or want a more complicated package (like photo shop).  It also makes downloading, uploading, labeling a breeze!I also like that they included extensive documentation, 2 print manuals and one on disk.I am still thinking about swapping this out.  At this point it is nearly new but past the point where I can return it.  I am however, considering selling and replacing it as I am not only dissatisfied with it as an all around camera, but I am not sure it is adequate for the 1 simple thing I purchased it for (stationary art photos).

I'm not anything near a professorial photographer. I do, however take tons of photos.I've had this camera for a little over a month now (I've taken hundreds of pics with it already). It was a long road getting to this purchase- weeks of research, I even bought a $200 point n shoot camera that I was simply unimpressed with... the pictures were no better than my $80 camera that I wanted to upgrade from. Then, I stumbled across this one. At first, I found the 'body only' version, but seeing as I know nothing about lenses, I sought out the kit instead.I'm very happy with the camera and the pictures it takes. The basic settings are intuitive and easy to use once you've discovered them. I haven't noticed any artifacts from pictures that were taken in less than ideal lighting (and then brightened on my computer), which was my biggest problem with the old camera.The included lens covers an acceptable range for my needs. If you want to take pictures further than 20 feet away from a subject, you may want another lens. Also, you may want another lens for macro photography (the included lens does ok up to a point, but you may have trouble getting pictures of makers marks in jewelry, for example).Good news is that macro attachments are available pretty cheap. Zoom lenses on the other hand, not so much, but there are adapters that let you use many brands of lenses (you lose the auto focus, though) I've been looking for an inexpensive, clean looking lens to show up at my local second hand store, but no luck yet.The LCD does leave something to be desired, but they sell an eyepiece that is supposed to remedy that... it's kinda pricey, so I don't have one just yet. The built in screen is ok, but you miss a lot of fine detail, such as background blur, which, if you were trying to take amazing photos, you'd want to see clearly. Without it, you just have to hope that the focus is where it says it is/where you want it, and that the blur is right.. or take several pictures. It's not like you're wasting film.So the screen isn't amazing. This is really my biggest gripe, but I don't think it comes down to the quality of the screen, it's more the size, and they couldn't have put a much bigger screen on the camera, so there you go.I recommend getting a screen protector right away.

It has a micro 4/3rds sensor which is smaller than the size of an APS-C/APS-H that is found in DSLRs and bigger than the sensors in digital cameras.  While some men say it's possible to get excellent photos with cell-phone cameras and digital cameras that have a 1/2.3\" sensor, this is in fact untrue.  One can indeed get similar results from those cameras but the amount of time and labour required is much greater (post-processing, optimal lighting, optimal subject, etc.).  However, a very basic DSLR costs about 200 dollars more than this Olympus camera.  And so how is this camera alike and unlike a DSLR?  List:Like a DSLR:  Changeable lenses, reasonable size sensor,  good kit lens, lot of options, takes photos in succession quite rapidly (almost 1 every second, which is very slow compared to DSLRs but faster than most digital cameras),  one can control shutter speed, aperture, ISO.Not like a DSLR.  Note that a difference doesn't always mean it's negative:  As mentioned, the frame rate for taking pictures is much slower than a DSLR.  One medium-level problem with this camera is that it doesn't come with a viewfinder.  The body is much lighter and smaller than a DSLR but very well made, good quality.  The lenses are much smaller but again good quality.  And of course the most important difference is the image quality.  The images from a cheap DSLR are usually 85% of a professionally shot image that used an expensive DSLR camera ($1250).  This Olympus camera gives about a 90% quality image compared to a cheap DSLR, meaning about 80% quality compared to an expensive DSLR.  For men who want to take DSLR photos every time they press the shutter, an entry-level DSLR is better.  However, this will get good very good results 5 out of 6 times and for the layman who needs a much better camera than his $150 digital camera, this is very acceptable.Overall an EXCELLENT camera for the price!!!!!", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera.", "Author": "Gs", "ReviewID": "R211LGDI73ERKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's cheap.

I've photographed weddings, charity events, and have been paid for my work, so I know how to use a camera.  Never before I have owned a camera so frustrating to get a picture in focus.  I've read the manual for this camera and understand how the contrast detection autofocus works, but the in-focus shots with the kit lens comprise no more than 40-50% of the pictures and video taken so far, no matter what mode it used.  Other digicams I've owned have been slow to autofocus, but if they couldn't lock on, they told you so.  The E-PL2 is a liar, promising that the AF has locked on, but more often than not it's focusing on the background.  The shallower depth of field from the larger sensor makes the problem worse.  Unfortunately, without any kind of viewfinder, I don't see any fix for this.While the camera feels very nice in the hand, be aware that cheap materials have been used to build the camera to a price point.  The rear LCD screen has a cover that is plastic, not glass, and it scratches if you so much as look at it too hard.  I've had 2 other cameras with a similar cover design - but they both used glass and survived years of use without a scratch.  It does not bode well for this camera's long-term durability.The positives of this camera come from that larger sensor - it has low-light capabilities for still pictures and video that far exceed other digital cameras, and when the focus does work you can produce a nicely defocused background to highlight the subject.  It comes with better-than-average software to process RAW images, and there is a nice ecosystem of accessories and small, light lenses that take full advantage of the Micro 4/3 format.Perhaps my kit lens is defective since other reviews are so positive, I don't know.

I don't have a lot of experience with removable lens cameras, but the lens seem very high quality and easy to use. I have been using the camera for about two days in all different conditions.If you are capable and willing to adjust and optimize settings for certain photographic situations, then this camera will be fine.  If you intend to share the camera with your wife that expects good indoor pictures in iAuto mode, then pass. The quality and color tone of the pictures in iAuto mode did not please my wife and I.  Using iAuto mode indoors with overhead lighting without the flash we found that pictures had a distinct yellowish-beige hue.  With the flash tuned on the colors were better but a bit washed out.  In movie mode, there is no flash, and the indoor movies always had a yellowish-beige hue to them.  Some of the advanced settings corrected this problem a little, but my wife did not want a camera that required setting adjustment in iAuto mode, and we take a lot of indoor pictures.  Simply put it was difficult to render true white colors with this camera in an indoor atmosphere with moderate lighting conditions.In natural outdoor lighting the pictures are excellent.I question why people think Olympus JPEGs are so good.  The JPEGs do not accurately represent colors in many conditions, especially moderate to low light. There may be some conditions where the Olympus JPEG \"processing adjustments\" works, but sometimes it makes pictures worse.  It seems like Olympus is too often trying to \"process and enhance\" the JPEG instead of just rendering the RAW file with JPEG compression.I am still looking for the perfect, small, DSRL quality camera.  I do believe Micro Four Thirds is the future.Update:The \"warm\" look of the Olympus images are just too yellowish for me.  Its a preference I guess.

I've never scratched a screen on any of my digital cameras or cell phones before. This camera was brand new and stored in a a brand new camera case when it wasn't being used. The monitor screen ended up with a bunch of tiny scratches during normal use during the first few weeks I owned it and brought it on vacation. It shouldn't be possible to make tiny scratches as the screen should be hardened to the extent where only a major impact puts a scratch on it, and that would create a deep scratch- not a bunch of tiny ones that are more indicative of the plastic just being too soft.In my situation, I realized that the screen was just too soft- likely defective. The screen obviously sticks out and rubs against your shirt when it's being used and it needs to be able to rub against things like shirt buttons. They designed it so that the screen is the outermost part of the camera back- so it will always be resting against something when in the case of hung from the neck strap.Anyway, Olympus failed to honor the warranty on the screen despite the fact that it was defective and became scratched way too easily during normal use. They don't even allow for two-way communication with their warranty process. They simply state that the camera needs to be sent in and they'll make their own determination as to whether it's a covered repaired. It's interesting to note that the only way to make that determination would have been to contact me and ask me how I used the camera in order to determine how the scratches got there. They never contacted me other than to send a repair estimate without explanation. They aren't interested in customer feedback at all.The second item has to do with the fact that the movie button is located on the back right side of the camera right near where your thumb normally goes when gripping the camera. This creates a situation where the button gets inadvertantly pressed on occassion. You really have to be careful to not to accidently press it during normal use. It especially happens because the camera normally gets pressed against your thumb during normal holding of the camera- the weight of the camera pulls it downward and to the left, and your thumb naturally prevents the camera from falling out of your grip. So despite being careful with the movie button, it is still way to easy to accidently press it. I can't believe they didn't figure this out during testing.The photos are nothing special and the placement of the movie button really makes it a hassle to quickly a picture.

The pictures look washed out, kinda cheap, flat, point and shoot look. This lens reminds me the kit lens sold with all Canons back in the day. Pure garbage.3. ISO base for stills 200? Yes, I knew before I bought it but I only realized how mandatory is ISO 100 when I started using the PL2.4. ISO base for video 400? This must be an Olympus joke. Even ISO 200 on a P2 is a stretch, but 400? One needs a ton of ND's to get the speed down to 1/30 outside.5. Noise at base ISO. The level of noise in dark areas at base iso is unreal. Blotches and spots. Horrible. And it's not the kit lens, I tried both cameras (p2 and pl2) with the Panasonic 20mm.

Maybe 3 if it comes down around $300, though the lower price doesn't make it a better camera, it's only the feeling that I didn't spend that much for a mediocre device.Again, you can call me anytime an Olympus fanboy, and I wouldn't mind, but the PL2 is not a keeper.

We leave for a long awaited family vacation to Disneyland this Saturday and will have NO camera to record the memories!! I am crushed.

If you have high blood pressure, the attempt could be deadly.I just got back from a safari in Africa with the epl2. My results were spotty owing to the lack of a viewfinder.The camera is largely useless without one. In even moderate sunlight you cannot see the screen. Without glassesyou are completely out of luck. There will be no composing and little hint of the final shot until you get intothe shade with your glasses on. All you can do is point the camera in the general direction and hope for the best.The viewfinder is $240 bucks. Put that into the purchase decision.I am also not convinced that I would ever use any of the various \"art\" settings as I do all of that sort of thing quickerand better on my computer. I would trade all the bells and whistles for a proper viewfinder. If you are a Mac user the offeredPenPal is not compatible.

Fletcher", "ReviewID": "R1KEA619POMGME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off let me say this is still a okay camera, Its handling is nice, however as someone who had a Sony Nex 3 beforehand; there are some major points of contention that have to be said that the brand sheep here are oblivious to.1)Crop Factor. Ultra wide angle? Forget about it, its not happening with this tiny 2x crop sensor and is massively more constricting than the 1.5x crop factor APS-C cameras.2)low light ISO performance. Likely for the same reason as above; the low light performance and resolution suffer badly from the small sensor. Strongly improved over the E-PL1 its still lacking next to the now old Sony Nex cameras.3)Price! Micro 4/3rd cameras would definitely have a niche for around $400 and would revolutionize smaller sensor compact cameras. As it is; it's squarely in Samsung, Sony Nikon and Canon entry enthusiast territory, all with bigger better sensors.4)Size, it's not so small. With the 16mm pancake lens my old Nex was a true pocket camera, not nearly so much as with the Olympus and its atrociously narrow frame pancake lens.Still I will be keeping this camera till I find another 1.5x sensor camera. The hot shoe and design of the camera is nice, but honestly I hate Olympus for making this camera half frame just for higher profits and to 'honor' the old PEN cameras.
