{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful little digital camera--Very small and lightweight!", "Author": "Pruitt Hall", "ReviewID": "R132I6CE7HNQNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony really got everything right on this little camera.  My wife and I already own the higher end DSC-717 5 megapixel Sony.  That camera is unbelievable in its own right, but I do home inspections and wanted something I could slip into a shirt pocket.  This little Sony does that well, but it does so much more.  I still can't believe all of the features they packed into something this small.  It's 3.2 megapixels which is more than fine for 95% of the shots you'll take; that will print up to almost 8x10 with no noticeable loss of detail.  Flash works very well, offering red-eye reduction if you want to use it.  Zoom is very good, offering both digital and optical zoom modes.  I personally don't mind the digital zoom, although some people prefer the optical only.  In the >3x zoom mode, the digital only kicks in for the last tiny bit of the zoom, so I don't see it as a pro nor con.  Battery life is amazing, as it has been for the past two years with all Sony digital cameras.  The new Lithium batteries just last forever; well over 100 shots, easily.  As we already have one Sony digital camera, I didn't have to install a thing; everything from the software to the transfer cable to the PC worked from the older Sony.  Thankfully, Memory Stick prices are coming down; a good 128mb stick will likely be all you'll need.  I'm using 64mb sticks and with the resolution set at 2mb, that's over 30 pictures per stick.  And since it's digital, you can instantly delete what you don't like, so, literally, all of your shots, in the end, are keepers.  Has an incredible movie mode; even better than the over $1,000 DSC-717; it eats up a ton of memory sticks to do it, but I'm thinking about tossing the videocam; it's really that good.  Menu options allow filters for sepia (so nice to see interiors in sepia; makes them look turn-of-the-century), solarize, black and white, negative, etc.  Plus it offers seven 'scene' modes, such as the beach (which corrects the balance to show the ocean in its correct shade of blue), fireworks, distance shots, etc.  Also has a very good macro capability if you like shooting flowers in close detail. All in all, I spent some two hours with the camera when I first got it homeand was truly taken back by how many features it offers.  And don't forget the biggest feature:  IT IS SO SMALL!!!!  Not so small like the new cell phones that are TOO tiny; just the right small so that you can put it in your shirt pocket.  It doesn't weigh a thing either (it's in the ounces category).  Just a real tour-de-force of what can be packed into a small package, still remain user-friendly, and put a true grin on your face when you use it.  There are a ton of under 5 megapixel cameras out today; Sony, Canon, Olympia, Kodak, HP, Panasonic, Leica, Epson, etc.  all make cameras that compete with this Sony.  Yet I don't see any of them offering all of the features this camera has.  I don't give out many 5 stars on products, but this one earns it in every way.  If you're just starting out in digital photography, you'll appreciate getting this many features in such a small package and one that doesn't need a PhD in Engineering to operate.  If you're a seasoned pro in the digital world, you'll love having this little guy in your pocket, just so you don't have to lug around the bigger equipment.  Highly recommended in every way.", "Date": "July 8, 2003"}, {"Title": "So much better than Canon", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3RACYDM1AVFQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was debating between a Canon S400 and this Sony P8 so Idecided to play with both cameras at my neighborhood bestbuy.  The Sony P8 produces better image quality and color than the Canon.  The guys at BestBuy let me print out images taken by the cameras so I can compare the results instantly as the print out quality is very important to me.  To top it off, the sony has a much user friendly interface and I was able to master the camera navigation w/o asking questions nor looking at manual.  I couldn't figure out the Canon at all.I took some amazing photos from my recent trip and blew some up to 8x10.

The battery life is excellent (second only to the DSC-P72/92). The 3x zoom is suitable for 95% of travel shooting situations. With the addition of a 128mb Memory Stick (which are very cheap after rebates, see Lexar/Sandisk), this camera - at full 3.2 megapixel resolution - can fit tons of shots. The video mode is what sold me! Imagine taking 640x480 resolution video, with sound, for as long as the Memory Stick can hold... (Heck, I returned the DV camcorder I just bought, and waited for a month for this camera to be released.) Good selection of accessories (although pricey). Best accessory? Two words: Underwater Housing. The controls are VERY easy to use! I haven't look at the manual yet... but I will soon... there are probably many new tips/tricks to learn.Quality of photos: The wonderful thing about this camera is that on full-auto mode, the shots are outstanding. Are you in a tricky shooting situation? Take control with \"Scene Modes,\" making those snowboarding pictures come out awesome! The camera does lack fully-manual control over exposure, whitebalance, and f-stop, but my wife does not have the patience to learn photographic theory, nor does she have the patience to wait for me to tinker with the shot. Most of the photos I've taken have been in full-auto mode, and I'm very pleased at the results.Misses: No remote control... I love this about my Canon film camera. You don't realize how handy this is until you don't have it. Also, the add-on lenses require a plastic snap-on adapter. But that's the price you pay for unbelievable portability.Slow focusing in low light (especially outdoors). Sometime you have to hold the shutter release button down for five seconds before it will fire. Set to (P) program mode and manually set the focus distance to speed up the process.Conclusion: Excellent camera for the price. Resolution is more than adequate for my shooting situations, and it fills up the Memory Sticks slower. Video mode is the best out there.

It produced great pictures and I used it a lot but it finally broke after 2 years. I did some research and I saw good reviews for this Sony camera and liked the compact size and the set of features. I bought it and did some pictures indoor of my daughter. Next day I connected it to the PC and downloaded the pictures. Big surprise. The pictures were grainy, yellowish and out of focus. Way worse than my old Fuji. I tried to play with the settings, do some pictures outside, read again the manual. I got better results outdoors but still not quite right. Really disapointed with this camera. I returned it back to the store and I ordered something else.

Ok first off, if you are not planning to enlarge the picture greater than 8\" by 10\" [inches], then you dont need a camera with more than 3 MP[mega-pixel] resolution. The greater the MP, the more you can enlarge a digital picture without causing to blur. Just for comparison, the 'old' film [35 mm] camera took a 1 MP picture, so practically with a 3 MP camera, you can enlarge it about 2-3 times without causing it to blur, so make sure you keep that in mind before going for the 8 MP camera. Next, the zoom....consider only the optical zoom of a camera to get a great picture. The digital zoom, is a computer enhanced image, which is not so great.Having said all this, this camera is unbelievable! The results are incredible. It allows you to take pictures in an email mode, which stores two copies of the same picture, one for emailing and one for printing[full size]. Also the flash is quite extraordinary. The best is the result with movie mode. The movie is with sound which is also incredible. However you would need at least 128 MB memory stick to get a 4 and a half minute video. Dont get fooled by the 90 min video advertisement, that is only in VGA mode, and quite unacceptable for viewing or showing it to friends. Other than that, the camera works great, results everyone will enjoy and you will cherish.

It has SCN modes, that takes amazing pictures at night, snow, beaches, and in very bright condition. Live Histograms helps in taking good pictures and setting light focus. The camera also shows shutter time for its current setting. Its a good feature for doing good photography.P8 has MACRO mode that takes superb closeups. For the naive photographers, it has auto option. You can take movie of 640x480 with sound till you fill up your memory. It is a superb option. The movie is very clear in daylight.No other camera with this specification, in market can take better quality of indoor pictures as Sony Cybershots.The camera is small and light in wieght. Sony has once again come up with the product that rocks in the market. I think its worth paying for this camera.Camera comes with lots of options that helps in taking good pictures at different times.

I'm now back and must tell you the only problem I had with this camera was trying to get night shots - really need to have the tripod for a serious shot.

One of the smaller camera that Sony manufactures, but it also provides lots of features usually not present in cameras of this size. MOVIE MODE: The MPEG movie quality is just as good as my bigger SONY, the only downside being you can't use the zoom feature while recording. On the other hand, there is also another movie function, 16 frame burst, which my bigger camera doesn't provide.STILL IMAGE: Since my other camera was a 5.2 megapixel, the lesser picture quality on the DSC-P8 was very noticable, but they are still quite good. Considering the photographer is not a professional, this camera has VERY GOOD pictures for a small point and shoot camera.SIZE: This camera is both light AND compact. It's designed well enough to fit comfortably in one's hand, yet compact enough to be carried in a persons pocket or purse. The only downside with the size is that with one hand shooting, it's easy for your fingers to accidentally press the buttons on the back. INDOOR SHOOTING: Differences in lighting and distance has negative effects on this camera. The subject or objective you're trying to shoot may not always recieve the type of lighting you wish with the flash on this camera. The flash battery recovery time is VERY GOOD though, pausing only one or two seconds before you can take another picture.OUTDOOR SHOOTING: Taking pictures outside with this camera is GREAT. If the flash is not needed, the camera takes care of everything, providing sharp, colorful pictures.OVERALL: This camera is exactly the same size as the DSC-P10, only SLIGHTLY lighter, both in weight and in color. The DSC-P10 also has a bracketing feature which takes 3 pictures with different settings for you, so you can pick the best, but most people do not need that. If you're planning to get a small digital camera and don't need extreme quality, buy the DSC-P8 and save a hundred bucks.", "Date": "November 27, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great camera, time delay", "Author": "Phillip", "ReviewID": "RRZ9NKRGVH5H4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched around for along time.  I bought this camera  and liked it alot.it has everything that you would expect from a camera at this price.  it is a compact design.  \"3.2\" (actually 3.1)is a perfect resolution.Cons- there is a little time delay between pushing the button and when it takes the picture, just about every digital camera has this and you will learn to live with it.  the indoor quality is pretty good just some times it turns the flash on automaticly and that can get a little anouying.I would recommed this camera to anyone who has the money.

Before making this particular purchase for myself, I've purchased it for someone and was particularly attracted to this camera's compact size and lightweight. Beyond that, everything including the menus and navigation were OK although I still find that Canon's operations are much easier. However, the most attractive feature of this camera is how silent the operations of its lens, particularly when zooming in and out, as compared to Canon's S330 noisy lens operations.

I must say it is very much comparable to the P9. Battery lasts 90 minutes and when you turn off the LCD, even when the battery is almost flat, you will still be able to make at least 20-30 pictures. The menu is easy to use. The only problem I feel with this model is that when using automat sometimes the pictures come out either too bright or too dark so it is actually better to use manual otherwise the pictures are a very good quality the same with the video. P8 makes excellent pictures in dark - flash is quite strong.The zoom is sufficient - I am only using the optical and switched off the digital zoom.

For that, you don't need all those megapixels.So, I bought this camera.  One selling point was the lithium ion battery versus the nicad other models in this price range have.  Also, I have other Sony products and have never been disappointed as the quality is high.  This is a great little camera, with the emphasis on the word little.  It was easy enough to learn how to use in an hour or so with the owner's manual.

I read a lot of reviews on the net and in magazines and decided this would suit us best. It has taken some fantastic shots, and the battery life, and ease of media (memory sticks) is very practical, although the memory sticks are a bit expensive.Unfortunately I broke the LCD display last month when I fell on the camera whilst snowboarding. The camera still works fine but the LCD is useless. I telephoned Sony UK to see if it could be repaired but the quote they gave me was more than the camera would cost to replace. This seems like such a waste, as essentially the camera still does what it should do, but with out the screen navigating the menu's is impossible. I'm desperately trying to track down a new LCD screen for the camera, as it is very easy to remove and will try to fix it at my own expense and calling our insurance company if it still doesn't work. I find it so frustrating that companies would rather throw things away than try to repair them at a reasonable cost. Even with the engineers time there is know way it would cost the figures they quoted me. After all I managed to remove the screen (6 screws and two cable sockets) in less than 5 minutes! Add another 5 minutes for installing the new screen, if I ever get one, and you'd need to be on a very high hourly rate to warrant the money they're quoting.My advice, look after your stuff, don't snowboard with a camera (in a case) on your belt, take out good insurance, and put pressure on companies that would rather replace than repair.", "Date": "March 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "If you've been searching, this is the camera you want!!!!", "Author": "Jack Bristow", "ReviewID": "R3KD4LZ11D489U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a digital camera and ran into this one.

Following are some of the problems that I observed.1. The image editing software that comes with camera sucks..!! Menus doesn't have written descriptions and very difficult to understand/use.2. Night shots in automatic mode were a bit dull. I encountered the red-eye problems too. Red-eye reduction mode is pretty slow.3. LCD screen is too small to judge the quality of the photo. Sometimes I thought that the photo was good whereas after seeing on computer it was shaky.4. When you watch images in playback mode, it takes sometime (around 1-2 sec) for the LCD screen to display the image with proper resolution. This reduces your playback speed. Sony says it is pretty normal. 5. In movie mode, you can not use zoom which is pretty bad.I haven't used all the different modes and options. But,Following are some of the nice things.. 1. The image quality is very good and colors are pretty sharp. I have printed photos upto 8x10 size and I haven't faced any problem with the resolution of the image.2. The camera has 3:2 mode which can reduce the problems of cropping when you develop the photos in 4x6 size.3. The auto focus speed is very good. So, you can take more pictures in less time.4. Camera is very cute and handy. You can keep the camera in your pocket and take it anywhere you want.5. Menus in camera are very intutive and you can get used to it pretty quick.6. Camera comes with AC Adapter and batteries also which is very nice. Other companys' 3.2MP cameras may come for less price but you have to spend additional money on rechargable batteries and adapters.Overall I was only disappointed with software and in all other respects it is a nice camera to own. -Raja", "Date": "February 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "This camera is GREAT............", "Author": "Igrar Huseynov \"postix\"", "ReviewID": "R2P6FHSG1SJ8TM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its about 16 months , im using this camera.

This summer I made a promise to myself to buy a digital camera and a digital camcorder.  I purchased the camera first and selected Sony because of goods reviews and because I have a Sony VAIO computer.For someone who knew very little about digital photography, it was surprisingly easy to learn how to operate this camera.  All of the controls are easy to get at and to understand.  The camera takes very good pictures and is not large and bulky like the DSC72,92 etc.  However, it is not too small either.  The software that is included makes it very easy to transfer images to my computer via USB.  Using USB was not my first choice but I have to use it becuase my one year old Sony VAIO can only read regular memory sticks and not the memory stick pro format.  I have found that pictures taken at the highest quality usually take up about 1.3 to 1.8 megs per picture.I really like the movie capabilities of this camera.  You can take movies in two image qualities:normal and email.  The normal .mpg file will be quite large.  A 256 meg memory pro stick can hold one 10 1/2 minute movie and this file will be approximately 240 megs in size.  You can transfer these movies to your PC or watch them on your tv with appropriate cables.  The camera comes with a USB cable and an S-video cable for the tv.  As you are watching the movie on the TV or viewing pictures, you can zoom in/out, pause, fast forward, rewind, etc using the controls on the camera.  This has worked so well for me that I am no longer going to buy a digital camcorder.I purchased an accessory kit with the camera that included an extra battery (even though I have not needed it yet), a case for the camera and a case for memory sticks for another $79.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this camera to everyone.  You may also want to look at the DSC10 which is a 5 megapixel camera for only $50 more and is the same size.  I did not get that one because I had to buy a new printer and other things at the same time and had to stay on budget.", "Date": "September 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good features but very pricey!", "Author": "superman2k3 \"superman2k3\"", "ReviewID": "R10XRK5QRZ02V4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all the image quality from P8 is very good in day light. The battery life is about average. The infolithium also shows mins remaining, this makes up for shorter battery life. The zoom lens is very good and so is the smart zoom feature. The movie are good but still very grainy & take up lots of space on the stick.The problem with the camera is its expensive and proprietary battery. The extra battery from Sony is priced very high. The expensive memory sticks make it worse. Just check out the price of sticks versus the CF card and you will realize the premium Sony charges on each of these sticks. Most other accessories are also priced very high. All these things add to cost of the camera substantially, so keep them in mind.Finally the camera isn't as small as Canon Elph's and neither does it offer any good shots at night or indoors. All in all its a good camera if you want to pay for its Sony label, otherwise there are many better compact cameras.

It is the right size, takes excellent pictures, even videos with sound (quite good for a Cybershot, but it is not a video camera, though) and reasonably priced.Nevertheless, it lacks of some more manual control, especially needed for pros.

Most features are accessible in a turn of the wheel and a button press, without hierarchical submenus or cryptic incantations. Although the feature set is rich, Sony's engineers prioritized the needs of the user over the needs of the engineer (or the needy ad copy). This is Sony's traditional strength; they aren't the leader in consumer electronics for bleeding edge innovation or gold-plated transistors.2) The matchbox shaped compacts suffer usability in their small footprints. I don't have especially large hands, but hitting the shutter with my pinky without smudging the lens or dropping the camera reminded me of early laptop trak-balls and PDA keyboards.

I would have to say I didn't know how great this camera was until I was on those vacations taking snapshots of everything! First was the response I got. Almost everyone in my campsite or tour group said, \"Whoa, nice camera!\" No surprise though, this IS a nice camera! On top of it, when I compared the camera and photo quality other people had on their digital cameras, I noticed mine was sooo much better. Not to brag, but the P8 really did the job and impressed others. This camera is worth every penny, and works like a dream. In a way, it has kind of spoiled me. This is my first digital camera, and really makes me optimistic about digital cameras, when in reality, not all cameras are as good as this one.

Just take a look at it, and then take a look at the price for what you get. I personally like this product also because it's by Sony, and they put a lot of work into thier cameras. It's so detailed, sleek and cool looking!!! That's my main point. It's also very high quality and durable. On top of that, its most important part, its loaded with all the features for an average person, who wants to take simple pictures! You wanna take advanced pictures and movies with your camera also? SURE! It can do that to! It's packed basically.Why to get this camera:1) Beats all the others on the market! (ok, that might sound a little redundant)2) You get so much with this camera!3) It looks so stylish!And there are more I'm just too tired now...Bottom Line: If youre shopping for digi cams, go out and check all of them out and then take a look at this one (P8).
