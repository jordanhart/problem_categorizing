I originally bought the Linksys WVC54G and now have the Hawkings NC320W. Both are very good for senior monitoring purposes. I now prefer web cameras which use Java applets (NC320W) instead of ActiveX (WVC54G). There are situations and browsers that simply can't use ActiveX and thus can't display images. The quality of both web cams is suitable for senior monitoring. Expect image quality to fall off in low light. The WVC54G has a wider field of view. This can be important in situations where you'll have to buy two NC320W to see everything whereas only one WVC54G is needed. I am now using three NC320W and viewing using Firefox browser. Warning: setting up a router to handle multiple web cameras needs a near router expert. The NC320W may soon become obsoleted by the newer and cheaper HNC230G (not released as of this date). I recommend setting up the cameras using static IP addresses so power outages won't cause new addresses to be reassigned.True Story. Everyday I check on mom to make sure she's ok. While on vacation in Australia, I tuned in at the very moment she fell off the couch in Chicago. Using Skype, I called the senior home to have someone help her get up. Although she could have slid over to the phone and called for assistance, the important thing is that I learned she falls and can't get up by herself, and she hasn't been telling us. The WVC54G works well for this application. I can even see which DVD she's watching. I had to open port 1024 to get it working so it's not plug and play. Once running, it has never gone down, very important. My only complaint is that the auto white balance isn't true. Colors and lighting are somewhat off.", "Date": "December 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "Works fine if you are careful and methodical!", "Author": "C. Blakely", "ReviewID": "R3BA4SVU64UFQ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[EDIT]Ok, 3 weeks after setting these cameras up, I do have a few negative comments.  The cameras will sometimes spontaneously stop working.  I haven't been able to figure out why.  I'm on the other side of the country from them now so I can't physically see them.  Eventually they come back online.  All 3 are just sitting there plugged in, in an empty house.The video is fairly choppy if sound is enabled, even at 320x240.The lighting plays a huge role in the quality of the image - bright sunlight in a window makes the image almost unusable.  The image is very poor in dim lighting as well.The field of view is pretty narrow and there's nothing you can do about it - I wish there was a wide-angle option.I wish the interface to the camera was editable, and that you could show multiple cameras on the same page.Other than that, they cameras basically work as advertised, but I couldn't recommend them for anything other than a novelty because of the image quality concerns and the reliability issues.  It's fairly cheap and is good for casual monitoring.[/EDIT]I just set up 3 of these for my father-in-law (all the kids gave them to him) in his vacation home.  He wants to be able to check on the house when he's not there.  They worked fine, as advertised, as long as I was careful and made sure I had the right firmware.  This is how I did it, without using the setup CD (which is confusing and was unnecessary for my setup).If you've got a Linksys router and you haven't messed with the IP ranges like someone else who posted has, it's really easy to do - the most important thing to do is set it up WIRED first!  I plugged the included ethernet cable into the router and into the camera.  Then I powered on the camera.  It booted up and showed 192.168.1.115 or something as the IP address in the little LCD window.  I opened up an Internet Explorer window on my PC.  Went to [...]  The configuration utility for the camera came up.  Clicked on \"View Video\", installed the ActiveX Control I was prompted for, and up it came - the camera worked.  Clicked on \"Setup\".  Default username and password are admin and admin.  Under \"LAN Settings\" I chose \"Fixed IP Address\", and assigned it the value I wanted.  For my 3 cameras, the IP address I chose were 192.168.1.150, 192.168.1.151, 192.168.1.152.  Subnet mask was always 255.255.255.0.  Gateway, Primary DNS, and Secondary DNS were all always 192.168.1.1 (the router's IP).  Tested each of those by opening Internet Explorer and going to the IP address for the camera (i.e. - [...]) and made sure they worked under the fixed IP address.If you have a non-Linksys router, or have messed with your routers' IP range, it's more complicated.  D-Link and Netgear use the 192.168.0.xxx range (0 instead of 1), and I presume to get these working you'll have to plug the ethernet cable from your pc into the camera, use IE to go to the address it shows in the LCD window of the camera.  The you should be able to change the IP address of the camera to an acceptable value (like 192.168.0.150)  Gateway, Primary DNS, and Secondary DNS would be the router's IP address (i.e. - 192.168.0.1).  Then you plug the camera into the router and you should be able to access it through IE on your PC at that new address.Once I was sure that worked, I set up the wireless settings.  Typed in the SSID the router uses, chose Infrastructure, clicked \"Enable\", and hit \"Apply\".  If you forget to hit Apply it won't take.  Then I hit \"Edit Security Settings\" and in the popup window chose the Default Transmit key from the router, and the key from the router.  Kept it on \"Open System\".  Then hit Apply and exit.Now I unplug the power from the camera.  Then unplug the ethernet cable from the camera.  Then plug the camera power back in.  The lights will flash and the indicator for wireless should come up, along with the IP address I chose.  Open up Internet Explorer again, type in the address again ([...] and it works.Did this with all 3, then placed them in the house where I wanted them, and tested them again.  All worked.Then I went into their configuration utilities and set up the Email Alert feature.  This is the only part that gave me trouble.  Basically what I figured out is that the 2 cameras that had Firmware version 2.07 worked fine, and the one that had 2.11 never worked.  I downloaded the 2.07 bios at ftp://ftp.linksys.com/pub/network/ (the file is called WVC54G_fw2.07.zip) and flashed the 2.11 camera back to 2.07.  Then the email notification worked fine.Oh and another confusing part was the \"Outgoing Mail SMTP Server\".  Turns out you pretty much have to use your internet provider's mail server, which I was able to find on their website.  He uses Charter Cable, and I found out on charter.net that the server is smtp.charter.net.  I also just set up a new GMail account specifically for these cameras.To make it easy to view the cameras from the internet, Linksys included this SoloLink DDNS thing which they charge for.  I opted for a free option, and made a new dynamic DNS account at dyndns.org.  I set up port forwarding on the router to forward alternate ports (I chose 2000 and 3000 - and set up the cameras \"Alternate Port\" to these values) to two of the cameras.  So now he can get to the three cameras by going to[...][...][...]That's it - works great and I'm happy with them.  I give it a 4 because the fact that I had to flash backward to an older bios in order to used an advertised feature is stupid.  Other than that, it's great - and no more difficult to set up than most other wireless networking devices.", "Date": "January 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Some pointers for ppl having configuration issues", "Author": "Sabrina Veksler", "ReviewID": "R23CIG9TZR9TR6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hi, I noticed that a lot of people are having difficulty setting this product up. I just wanted to offer 4 pointers.1: Configuring your router: In your router's configuration, you should assign this device a fixed IP outside of the range of DHCP addresses. This is so that, the next time you reboot your router or cable modem, DHCP doesn't assign the camera a different IP. Remember, DHCP hands out IPs on a first-come, first-serve basis unless you tell it otherwise. So, if you defined your router's DHCP to start with, let's say, 100, when you set up the camera, you can give it a fixed IP of 192.168.1.99 (or whatever) and know that it will persist.2. Opening your port: Be sure to choose a port number greater than 1024. Also, check your port forwarding page before deciding so that you don't conflict with other applications/services you have installed. When you pick your port, enable it to forward TCP requests to the IP you've specified, in my example 192.168.1.99.3. Accessing from outside: You will need the external IP address, which you can get from your router's status page. DON'T FORGET TO APPEND THE PORT NUMBER TO THE URL! That's a common mistake. If your public IP is 60.99.60.100, then your camera's URL would be [...] ://60.99.60.100:9999. NOTE: If, when you look at your router's status page, you're confused because your WAN (external) IP begins with 192.168, then the next step probably applies to you...4. IF YOU USE VONAGE or some other VoIP, there's an EXTRA STEP! Don't forget that the Vonage box sits between your cable modem and your router, acting as its own little firewall. Not only do you need to open the port here too, but also this is where you'd go to obtain your external IP! For Vonage subscribers, the configuration tool is accessible via [...] > Advanced Configuration. In this menu, forward TCP requests to the desired port number at your ROUTER's IP address (Vonage customers: 192.168.102.100), NOT your camera's. Your router will then proxy the request to the camera, so it's like this:[...] -> Internet -> your VoIP -> your ROUTER -> your cameraalright, that's all I got.

I had no difficulty at all setting it up for either wired or wireless operation.  The included software worked flawlessly allowing me to record sessions.For my purposes, my intention was to supplement a surveillance system I currently have in operation using two high resolution Toshiba network cameras.  I was hoping to be able to get half-decent quality from a camera costing 1/3 of the cost of the Toshibas.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for.In general 640x480 does not provide sufficient resolution for surveillance as you cannot make out features in any detail.  For example, you may be able to see someone entering your home, but you'll never be able to identify that person, especially with this Linksys.  Overall clarity was so poor that I still can't really determine whether or not this is a color camera (and if it's B&W;, I guess that's why).  Also, this camera is fairly useless in low light situations.  For example, if you had only a single 40W lamp on in a room, this camera displays mostly noise (white static).Finally, this camera is not supported by the surveillance software that I use.  The camera does ship with software, however, for surveillance use I need the software to not simply fill up the harddrive, but to make room by deleting old files and continuing to record.  The included software does not include any such functionality.All in all, for the price, it does what it advertises.

In short, nothing works.  The products are incompatible.  Here are details:First, the range expander:  After an hour on the phone with Linksys customer service, I was told the range expander is compatible only up to version 4 of the router.  I had purchased a brand new version 5, meaning I needed to DOWNGRADE the router in order to use the range expander.  Customer service told me to return the new router, gave me a barcode number for the old version 4 router, told me to search local stores by reading barcodes on each box I could find, and good luck...I might, just might, get lucky.(Note:  I have version 1 of the range extender, which does NOT have an Ethernet jack.  Version 2 apparently does, located right below the antenna on the front panel.  Good luck trying to figure this out on your own...the box claims compatability with the router)Second, the webcam.

Instead, it brings up my router's web utility.Yesterday, I spent close to three hours on the phone with various technical support and customer service people.  The last step:  a 2PM follow-up support call was scheduled for today, in which I was promised the problem would be addressed.  No one has called me.I just called Linksys support again.  After another 30 minutes on hold, I was given another promise that someone will call me \"at some indeterminate point in the future.\"This \"service\" is unacceptable.This has been the single worst customer service/technical support experience I have ever had.  I have wasted many hours, most of it on hold listening to the same annoying song.  I have been accidentally disconnected TWICE, once yesterday and once today, forcing me to call back and wait on hold until another support person became available.  Worst of all, the appointment for 2PM today was not kept, and I had to reschedule business appointments to accomodate Linksys.I have been very polite with all of the support people.  I understand that this is not their fault.

I had this camera up and running in under an hour with a static IP address on my non-Linksys wireless G network.  Video quality is acceptable but bleaches out with bright sunlight.  The image also gets grainy in low light but is still usable. Overall, I'm pleased with the image quality though I did feel the focus ring on the camera was a bit over sensitive.  The slightest adjustment dramatically changed the focus of the camera and it was hard to fine-tune the focus.  I was able to set up the free 90-day SoloLink DDNS service rather easily, including configuring it to work with my non-Lynksys router.  No complaints there though I'm not sure I will stay with it.  I may switch to one of the free DDNS services out there and save the $20 a year.  The email/motion detection function simply doesn't work. While I don't require such a function, it would have been nice to have.My main goal was to add it as a second camera for my personal weather station that already has a USB camera connected. The weather station software has supporting imaging software that overlays weather sensor data over the camera image.  I ran into problems getting this camera to work with that. Partly due to the camera and partly due to the weather station imaging software.  The first problem is with the camera being a network camera, it doesn't show as a local device on the PC so I can't select it as a capture device in the weather software.  And while this camera's software is capable of capturing still images, it can only be done manually.  There are no provisions for automatic still capture like with my USB camera which is configured to capture a sequentially numbered frame every 1 second. If it had that functionality, I could have made it work with my weather station software. However, the Linksys strictly streams a video.asf file and still capture and recording functions are controlled by the very limited software included with the camera.  My second issue was while I wanted to share camera video via the Internet, I didn't want visitors to my webpage to directly access the camera's web interface, only the video feed itself.  I used an ActiveX control within my own html to stream the video directly on my own webpage.  While I was able to code that into my own html documents and everything looked fine to me, I later discovered visitors to my page were not able to view the streaming video. As it turns out, the embedded ActiveX control would generate a TAG 45 Windows media player error on many systems when visiting my site.  With a bit of research I discovered this was due to a codec error.  The video.asf file the camera generates utilizes an audio codec that is not installed by default on most Windows systems with MediaPlayer 9.  To resolve this, I had to provide a link on my webpage for visitors to download the required codec as well as an additional link for users to connect directly to the camera's web interface (as an option for those who do not want to download the codec).  My third issue was discovered when I used the camera software's own record function to record some video. The resulting 58-second .asf file was over 10MB in size at 320x240 resolution at only normal quality. Typically, I am able to encode .wmv/.asf files at that resolution and quality at about 3MB per minute with my video editing software. Also as noted in another review, the video is a bit choppy with the sound enabled. While I was able to view the video files generated by the camera software's capture function with Windows Media Player, when I attempted to open them with standard video editing software, I received an error that stated the file was not properly indexed. I was unable to open the files none of the 3 video editing packages I have.  Ideally, I wanted to be able to open the files and resave them with better compression to reduce the file sizes and then make them available for viewing on my website.While I couldn't get the camera to do exactly what I wanted to do with it (I've given up on getting it to work with my weather station software), I am happy with the camera and will probably keep it.  With some minor work, visitors to my West Hartland, CT weather website can view the streaming video from the camera.", "Date": "January 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Does not work - not worth $40 much less $170 !", "Author": "R.

What I expected was that there would be software that would be able to start recording video when motion is detected for a period of time (e.g,. 2 to 10 minutes, or perhaps until no further motion is detected).

J. Simicich \"Gadget Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R15HMEWPTXSMSS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A couple of inaccuracies in other reviews:This camera presents a standard mpeg4 stream on a standard web interface - and if you have the codecs (they are around and common) you can watch the video from any system - Windows Media Player, or Linux using mplayer, or your Macintosh. Please see my comments on security of the Hawking below - if you have to have Java viewing, I strongly suggest the D-Link over the Hawking - Hawkings have no security.If the data stream really was only viewable with the Active-X control, that would be a reason to find this camera unacceptable. If there was a jpeg available via the built-in web server at a certain url (as the mpeg data is available, and as is the case with the D-Link, the camera would be a real home run).These are a new generation of \"webcams\". These cameras have a built in web server. They connect to your home net via ethernet, either wired or wireless. Management programs can display the images from the cameras on your computer screen.I recently examined a Hawking camera, and have also looked at a Linksys and a D-Link. Superficially, the Hawking seemed to have security, but there were only two official ways to get an image from the camera.  One was by using a facility where the camera e-mailed you an image. This image was tagged as spam by my provider because it used the big5 character set, even though it contained no text. But the other way was to use a java applet which was automatically downloaded from the camera, the same way any applet would be loaded.This was the only image data displayed on the camera's web interface.I wanted to get a still image, so I traced the applet's data stream.  The applet simply connected to a port on the camera and then presented four characters and a newline. The camera responded with a four byte header and a jpeg. I was able to use echo, sleep and netcat to pull jpegs out of the camera - but I did not have to present the password to pull jpegs out of the camera.The instructions that come with the camera tell you to open this port to the Internet via port forwarding from your firewall.  You also open the camera's web port.If you do this, then a hacker can see that you have this camera and then they can look for other open ports, and if they find the camera port, they can easily pull jpegs out of it with no password.This is OK, though, since the camera is so incredibly bad that all that anyone will see is sort of a flesh shaped amorphous mass.  I took this camera back to the store.There are two other products on the market. One is the D-Link DCS-900W, and the other is the Linksys Wireless G. Both are comparable to the Hawking and way better.The Linksys presents both sound and video as an MPEG4 stream. I know of no way to get still images from this camera (other than by having the camera e-mail you one).  There is an active X control that allows you to view the video on a windows system, or, with the right codecs, you can use Media Player or Mplayer to view the stream.  However, only a Windows user using Internet Explorer can access the camera through the web interfacr and see full motion video. Everyone else can go through multiple layers of frames to determe what the url is for the mpeg4 stream - then, that URL can be fed to a regular media player that can play (or record) an mpeg4 stream.The Linksys can be connected to a 10 or 100 wired ethernet, or to an 802.11b or 802.11g wireless net.  It supports WEP.  By default it is configured to run at a fixed address - but it can run on WEP.  A unique feature is that it has a small LCD panel and the LCD panel displays the IP address that it uses. It can look for motion within the camera and send out alerts by e-mail if motion is detected (that is, no external program is required to deal with automated motion detection from this camera).  All data is presented on the web interface, and basic authentication (userid and password) is demanded if the camera is set up to require it before the video stream, or any data other than the base screen is presented. There are two levels of users - those who can display the video stream and one user who can administer the box.I have not installed the Linksys management software - it seems to be unneeded. If I could find an open source solution that would allow me to convert mpeg4 to a still jpeg, then this would be the winning solution. But the conversion stacks I have found garble the images horribly. I believe that there is conversion available in the support software.The D-Link has a URL where a jpeg can be accessed.  All interaction is via web - and all interaction requires basic security.  There are two levels of users - One user who can configure the camera and those who can just display pics.The D-Link has a Java applet and an active-X control - take your pick - that allows you to view motion pictures - and it also has full motion video - so you can view full motion video from any browser that supports Java applets, or, if you are an IE user who has not installed Java, you can use the Active-X control to look at the video. Thus, the full motion video should work for almost everyone - I know it works in Linux and Windows. The D-Link has the best low light capability. It also has the clearest picture, by far.  It does not have 802.11g and it does not have sound. It does support WEP. Internally, (to the applet) the motion data is presented as a series of jpegs, using a standard http stream format. All video or jpeg data is presented only after successful basic authentication.The management software for the D-Link camera works reasonably well, but there is no reason to use it other than, perhaps, for upgrading the flash - although the \"lite\" software can present a very high quality full screen full motion video.  All motion detection recording on the D-Link is done in an application on a connected windows PC.These cameras cost a few dollars more than the Hawking, but they actually have a modicum of security.The Linksys is a winner if you need sound, or if you want to get the extra performance of an 802.11g device - if you do not have any 802.11b devices, you might well not want to introduce the first one.If you need motion detection in the camera, the Linksys devices also win.  Linksys cameras and a wireless router would obivate the need for a computer onsite, and, with a DSL connection, say, would allow for the accumulation, at a central site, of images where motion was detected.If you do not need sound - say, for a manned security setup, the D-Link cameras would allow you to put 16 cameras on a single screen - no wiring cost, and you could have motion detection and recording. That would be expensive, but probably much cheaper than any other solution.  Considering that you could avoid wiring, it would be a winner.", "Date": "February 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Bad Really Bad", "Author": "Ahmad A.

Given that I have very shallow understanding of computers, I would think that if I can do it, most people can as well.I agree with many people here that the support at Linksys is ineffective.  The help desk person tried, but in retrospect, he did not ask the right questions to get to the bottom of the problem.Now that the camera is working, I realize that this is exactly what I was looking for.

Croston", "ReviewID": "R2303CPA6YXH7A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I went to buy a webcam I wanted the following features the two major features: Wireless and Sound. I wanted to find a camera so that my family in other parts of the country could see and hear our Christmas celebration. I am a computer geek so when I saw this camera and thought the idea of a wireless device with its own web server would be cool, and I have a LinkSys 54G wireless router running my network at home so I thought it would be a snap to get this working at home. The first thing that really annoying thing was that when the setup software tried to scan for a wireless camera it couldn't find it. It turned out that I had to turn WEP security off, set the wireless to a different channel, and change the IP address range back to the 192.168.1.X(I changed mine to the 10.X.X.X when I first got the router). In short the instructions said I need to configure my router back to a basic out of the box router to get it to detect the camera. It never did detect it and I ended up having to use a network cable to configure the device. Once I got it setup and running I was not very pleased with the quality of the output that my family could see. The manual stated that this was due to network bandwidth problems but I have a fast DSL connection and my parents have a fast cable connection. So the band with problems had to come from the speed of the camera wireless connection, and I could not change that. To get a decent frame rate I had to turn the video quality to Very Low at 320x240 and the sound quality resembled that of a skipping record. There is a setting for a tiny 160x120 video image but there was no way I was going to do that given how much I paid for the camera. I bought it Christmas Eve and returned it the day after Christmas. I was very disappointed with this device given that I paid as much as I did but if I purchased the camera for a third of the price I MAY kept it thinking \"You get what you pay for\".", "Date": "December 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good for a fixed lens camera", "Author": "R.
