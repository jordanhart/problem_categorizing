{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A wonderfully full-featured camera at an unbeatable price", "Author": "Rimesh Patel", "ReviewID": "RUHDJ0ZTSDGVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the T1i for about almost week now and after some extensive use, here are my thoughts:1. 15.1 megapixel sensor. Yes, the high megapixel count is impressive, but keep in mind that, as you approach higher resolutions, you need to ensure the lens on the SLR can resolve that much detail. Sadly, the included 18-55mm IS lens is functional, but the high resolution really shows the so-so quality of the lens. Even if taken at the proper focus, pictures can appear soft with this kit lens. Shots I have taken with Canon EF-S 17-85mm and EF 70-200mm L lenses are crisp. I don't have any gripes on image quality. There are some issues with noise on the higher ISOs that don't seem to show up on the Nikon digitals, but overall, the quality is amazing for the price. Skin tones, textures, colors are reproduced very accurately.2. Digic 4. The Digic 4 processor appears to process/save the 15 megapixel images in the same time (if not faster) than the Digic III processor on the XSi (even in RAW+Jpg mode). I have also noticed that at higher ISOs, the sensor and the Digic 4 produce images with less overall noise compared with its predecessors.3. LCD. The 920,000 pixel LCD screen is large (3\"), crisp, vibrant and fully visible even in bright sunlight. In comparison, the Canon XSi SLR (which the T1i replaces), also has a 3\" LCD, but with 230,000 pixels. The viewing angle is great as well and the LCD can easily be seen nearly 180 degrees around.4. ISO 12800. Canon and Amazon are correctly identifying that the T1i maxes out at ISO 3200. Some less reputable dealers are listing an ISO 12800, which you should disregard. The ISO 6400 and 12800 settings are expanded ISO settings. The pictures taken on these two settings are ISO 3200 images pushed to ISO 6400 or 12800 by the Digic 4 chip before saving to the memory card. These pictures are extremely grainy and contain a lot of noise to the point of only being usable as for snapshots or adding an artistic effect to certain compositions.5. Penta-mirror. That Canon is still using one in the T1i is disappointing. The penta-mirror viewfinder image is functional, but still noticeably darker than that of the penta-prism viewfinder in the Nikon D90 (which is the T1i's main competitor). I really would have preferred if Canon had kept the XSi's 12.2 megapixel sensor, forgone 1080p video altogether, and maybe upped the cost of the camera slightly to cover the production cost of using a penta-prism in the T1i. Honestly, unless you are massively cropping your images, or creating large photos, the difference between 12.2 and 15.1 megapixels really is negligible.6. Size. This is the same body as the XSi, and therefore a bit on the smaller side compared to other digital SLRs. I have small hands, so the T1i is comfortable for me. If you have big hands, I can see this being a very difficult camera to use over an extended period of time. If you haven't handled a Canon XT, XTi or XSi, I would suggest you go to a store and hold the T1i yourself before purchasing it online. (I will upload a picture of the T1i in my hands to the user gallery for a size reference.)7. HD Video. Yes, the Canon marketing department made a horrible marketing decision and pushed the T1i onto shelves limiting the 1080p recording to 20fps (frames per second). Recognize this as a marketing gimmick that allows them put a 1080p sticker on the camera box. The 1080p @ 20fps is fine most times, but seems a choppy if you have a lot of action in the frame or are panning quickly. The T1i's 720p video is recorded at 30fps and is clean, smooth, and sufficient for all but the most discerning consumers. One major criticism though is that the sound is recorded in mono, AND there is NO input for an external microphone.A lot of pre-production reviews of the T1i criticize its inability to automatically autofocus while recording. I wouldn't put much weight in this criticism, mostly because neither of the other two SLR cameras with HD recording capabilities (Canon 5D Mark II and Nikon D90) can automatically autofocus while recording either. What you can do with the T1i is pan/zoom the lens and then press the AE lock (*) button to make the camera autofocus on the new subject (all while recording). A problem with using the AE lock button to have the camera autofocus is that the microphone for the camera is on the front upper left of the body near the lens mount. Therefore, the lens motor noise is picked up just as much as ambient sounds. Even with my quietest Canon USM (ultasonic motor) lenses, this lens motor sound is pretty loud in video playback. Although, remember, you can always manually turn the focusing ring on the lens to get your subject back into focus. It's not easy, but after a little practice, it's not all too hard, either.Ultimately, you shouldn't let the HD recording limitations sway you one way or the other. This is an SLR camera -- not a video camera. The HD video is a great feature, but if you're looking for something primarily to take video, look elsewhere. There are much better, cheaper VIDEO cameras out there which can record true 1080p.8. Record button. For some reason, the record video button is next to the LCD screen (the same button used for direct printing). The first few times you take video, you'll intuitively find yourself using the shutter release button used to take pictures. The reason for this switch is that you can take a still picture while recording video, although, doing so will interrupt the recording.9. Battery life. My first fully charged battery only lasted about 250 shots (no flash), but all charges since have given me in the range of 500-700 shots per charge. I'm guessing the first charge had such a short life because I spent quite a bit of time learning the camera, its menus, and settings.10. Live View. I honestly can't review this as I haven't used it too much yet -- I prefer using the viewfinder. One feature I can say is nice is that, on the LCD, you can digitally zoom in (up to 10x) on a section of your shot to ensure it is properly focused. This, and the fine focusing, can really help if you're into macro-photography.11. HDMI cable. The T1i has an HDMI Type C output on the body to allow you to directly display pictures and video on an HDTV. A minor criticism is that the HDMI Type C cable is not included in the box. You have to buy it separately. It would have been nice if it were included, as it's not an expensive cable.Conclusion. The T1i is a bit on the light end, yet the construction still feels solid. For the camera's price point, you'd be hard pressed to find any digital SLR out there which gives you all the capabilities and growth range of the Canon T1i. The camera is intuitive enough for those new to photography to pick and learn easily, yet configurable enough for advanced amateurs. If video is not a big deal for you, then get the Canon XSi. There is very little the T1i has (other than ISO 3200 and a sharper screen) that the XSi doesn't. Plus, with the release of the T1i, you can probably pick up a used XSi for a great price on eBay. My wife recently gave birth, and I'm not looking to record endless (never to be watched) tapes of video footage of our son, but I do want several minute clips of him as he grows through the years. I've always been more inclined towards photography, so this camera gives me a very versatile digital SLR that I need with the wonderful capability of recording HD video that I want.", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "First hands on experience...Very positive!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R2M7E7CR8M2IEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's a quick, first impressions (from hands on shooting) of the Rebel T1i.  Although we'll need more scientific examinations to determine ultimate image quality and usability, I'll try to give a hint into the camera's potential.I'll not go in to any real detail on the kit lens, which has been well reviewed.  Let's just agree that $100 for a good quality IS (image stabalized) lens is a very reasonable value it you don't have another option.  There are no obvious reasons this kit lens should make or break your choice of this camera over a competitor's.Styling and build wise, the T1i is an XSi made over, which is not a bad thing.  Some found that camera to be a bit on the small size for their hands, or a bit lacking in weight, but most like the size and weight (include me).  It uses the same, proven battery and accessories of the XSi.  I've already used some generic batteries that worked well in an XSi, with similar good results, but I do not want to lump all generics in the \"good to go\" category.In using the camera, the first thing you'll notice over the previous Rebels in the marvelous LCD screen.  Yep, the images look much cleaner even at the original size.  Don't get confused if you compare this camera side-by-side and think it's images are all that much better.  They just look much better on such a sharp LCD.First looks at IQ (Image Quality) were very impressive.  I tried using the camera in a variety of situtations (biased to how I would use it), and got very good results throughout.  Focusing was typical for a better Rebel, and images looked good throughout the ISO range, based on reasonable expectations.  I thought the Auto White Balance is a very good job compared to previous results I'd had with Canons in general.  They weren't perfect, but the tungsten areas seemed to look better than average.  All in all, I'd say Canon made reasonable progress with the jump to 15 meg, but probably no reason to trade-in your XSi.Live View never has been one of my biggest thrills, but the sharp LCD makes it a bit more enjoyable.  If I was still shooting macros, I would like it much more.But the biggest advantage of the newer screen for some will be while shooting videos.  I only did videos in the 1080p mode, and was impressed by the quality.  Sound was OK, and I was a bit disappointed that Canon doesn't have an option audio input (ala the 5D mkII or camcorders with intellegent shoe).  I'm also not sure how practical the videos will be, considering they aren't using a \"direct to HiDef player\" format like AVCHD or AVCHD Lite.  Also, 20fps is a bit odd for 1080p, but their software does support frame grapping, which should give nice 4x6 prints (there's a bit more than 2meg per frame).  The 720p is recorded in a more standard 30fps, which should also help with moving subjects.  You can also shoot a full 15meg image while recording your videos.  You videos are interrupted for about a second (you'll see a still image for that length in the video playback), but the high quality image will be recorded in its own file (no need to frame grab).  BTW, autofocusing did work during this recording, but the noise was picked up by the mic.OK, so I liked the camera, but how would I rate it compared to the competition.  Well, compared to the XSi, it's better, but maybe not worth the money.  The LCD is grand (that alone would get my money), and it's a no brainer if you need video or shoot lots of macros.  But with resent price drops and combo deals from Canon, the XSi should still be strong based on value.I've also had a bit of experience with the new Nikon D5000 (but even less so).  Although initial pricing is about $50 higher on the T1i, I thought the Canon was clearly more interesting.  I like the way Sony incorporated an articulated LCD, but hate it on the D5000.  I was constantly setting the camera down with the LCD back being the first thing to touch.  You might never break it, but you'll surely scratch the cosmetics.  The D5000 doesn't have the motor built into the body, so there's a bit of a limitation to lens.  However, the biggest drawback was that the D5000's built-in flash doesn't support their wireless flash system (with their new lineup, we'll have to move up to the D90).  The D5000 really needs to be lined up against the XSi, not the T1i.The 14mp Sony Alpha 350 might be a good value oriented competitor (when Sony offers bundles), but the IQ of the Canon's CMOS sensor is probably better in most moderate to low light conditions.  I think you'll be seeing something soon to replace this model.Thus, it's prime competitors should be Canon's own XSi, the D5000 (especially if they drop the price about $100 more), and for those with a bit more money, the Nikon D90.The T1i carries on the tradition of Canon Rebels with a lot of \"curbside appeal\" matched with solid performance.", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Video Problems with some sdhc cards (especially Kingston), You may miss some good shots unless you use sandisk extreme lll.", "Author": "smithnwesson \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R11VM8GH42SIY5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "**see update below, now give this camera a 4 star**** Video Test memory consumption rates and max minutes per clip  contained below.I couldn't wait to my hands on the new Canon T1i. It was a stretch for my budget but had most of the 5d mkll features. I was excited. I pre-ordered a body (I already have 2 xti's and lenses) but the only the kits are/were available so I upgrade to get it before a SciFi convention I attended.Higher iso and video, for the less than optimal lighting in the hall where the Celebs were speaking, attracted me.I tested the video for memory consumption rate the day I got it, no problem for a 20 minute test run. I saw a little white bar on the right side of the screen appear get a little bigger, then disappear. I figured it was a buffer level. Next day at the convention during Jeri Ryan's appearance I took a few stills and flipped into the video mode, nice.... until it stopped after a few minutes. Set it back up, pushed record again a few minutes later stopped, no warning, no beep, just stopped. Try again, now I notice the buffer bar reaches the top, it stops. I am using a kingston 8 gig class 6 sdhc, freshly formatted by the camera. That sucks! I missed a lot of good video because this new marvelous camera can't write fast enough. This occured on 2 different but identical cards so I thought the camera was having problems. It was on the 720p mode, 1080 mode could only go 8 seconds.****Update---I talked to Canon, to make a long story short, this camera is a bit finicky about which cards you put in it. Both kingston class 6 (fastest class) had problems, tried a kingston micro class 4 (slower) 4 gig and it worked fine, tried 2 Polaroid/pny 8 gig class 4's and they worked fine with only 1 buffer bar appearing occasionally, even on 1080. Canon guy seemed to like the sandisk brand. This begs the question of how can a class 4 work better than the class 6? I have a sandisk extreme III on order and will update this info if I have more problems with that.My wrath now turns to Kingston, who service has been xlnt.***update kingston- I returned a card to kingston, they sent a new one just as bad as the slow originals, which indicates ALL this type kingston are mot going to work in this camera for video.******Another update, with a Sandisk 8 Gb Extreme lll card the video worked fine, no buffer bar at all. Perhaps there should be a recommended list of sdhc cards so others don't have the trouble I did.That said, I was able to test the video as follows:I have tested my T1i for memory usage in video mode, here are the results using a Sandisk 8 Gig Extreme III:T1i Video Memory Usage Rates for a 1 minute file.1080 mode 282 MB720 mode 194 MB480 mode 131MBFollowing is for 5 minute file1080 = 1,383 MB720  = 988 MB480  = 638Any 1 clip can be 4GB max, so the following is an approximate max clip length1080 about 14 minutes720 about 20 minutes480 about 30 minutesThese figures are approximate as the content of the video will affect the compression and amount of memory actually used but these are pretty close to an average time you should expect. I did a little rounding so these are probably the on the low side you may get a little more time, but not much, maybe a minute.You can shoot as much video as the card will hold, just any 1 uninterrupted clip cannot be longer than 4 gig.Shooting Video also eats the battery, buy extras, one Battery per every 8 gig card should be about right.Bottom line-MAKE SURE you thoroughly test and 'season' the memory card BEFORE counting on getting complete videos. The first cards I tried did work on day 1 for 20 minutes but the buffer bar got to 3 or 4. Day 2 (the convention) was a different story, you read it above. DO NOT use KINGSTON CARDS.Stills are pretty good but I noticed on blowing them up the noise almost looks like dusty distorted scratchy marks on the sensor, not just the colored freckles. My XTi is better, My Nikon d200 is better, my Nikon d40 is better in the noise department. I cranked up the iso to speed up my shutter and some of the shots looked like very dirty/dusty slides I have from the 70's. I guess you can choose between the noise or slow shutter speed with the movement blur, or both. See the customer images for a sample of the noise at 6400 iso.****update on stillsStill shot Capacity on 8 gig cardLarge + RAW =286Just RAW = 359Large = 1375Medium = 2334Small = 4175* if you shoot any video mixed with the stills these numbers drop very fast.Other review sites had a pre-release version of this camera and they had the same video problem, (they did not name the sdhc card they were using, but I'd bet it was a kingston). Unfortunately there were not any reviews of actual cameras when I ordered it, just press releases. Now you have been warned and now you have this review. When you lose the video as the couple says 'I do' or other critical moment, you'll curse too.***I currently put a SanDisk 8 gb sdhc extreme III rated at 20 MB/Second, far and above the minimum class 6 rating of 6MB/sec, it seems to work flawlessly today, we'll see about tomorrow, but this showed no signs of the buffer bar on the side, looks promising!***update SanDisk still working xlnt.If you are going to do Video, and it important at all, I can only recommend the SanDisk 8 gb sdhc extreme III at this point. Just be warned that the video mode is very demanding and picky about the performance of the card, just the class rating is not to be counted on, as I found out the hard way. Some class 4's may work, even class 2's but that buffer bar will start showing up.>>>>>>>> Be Safe Buy the Sandisk Extreme III.>>>>>>>> Another user says Transcend 16GB Class 6 SDHC is performing well in video>>>>>>used A-Data class 10 sdhc 8GB card with no problems>>>>>>WARNING ---Centon Class 6 16GB SDHC crashed and as slow as Kingston DO NOT use CENTON cards, they do NOT comply with the speed rating.>>>>>>Polaroid/pny 16GB Class 4 cards work OK as long as you do NOT take a still pic while videoing.***Notes on Video File format generated by the t1i-This camera saves the video in .MOV files, which is fine if you have an apple/mac, BUT if you run xp, you must convert this format file to something else (avi, mpeg,...etc)in order to make a dvd with the commonly found software. Canon DOES NOT provide any software to deal with .mov conversion or transferring to a dvd to be played by a dvd player. This makes life a lot more complicated. Sure you can search around, get a file converter, then import to a dvd maker, then burn a dvd. Why should I have to search for these utilities and go through all that? Why couldn't canon have just put a simple dvd transfer or mov converter program in the bundle? Or have I just not found it yet?Canon, please remember, K.I.S.S. is a good principle.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera - Canon Rules", "Author": "H. Lakshminarayan \"Harish KL\"", "ReviewID": "R3EXKDQ5JB7L3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Requirements for a DSLR were as below:1. High Resolution LCD Screen.2. Great/Easy to use - User Interface.3. HD Video - 720 (30FPS) - (1080 was optional for me).4. Live View.5. Amazing Image Quality.6. Comprehensive Software Package.7. Large Variety of Lens options.8. Performance.9. Obviously, Cost (<1000$).In the curent market, i narrowed down to 2 cameras - Canon EOS 500D/T1i or Nikon D5000 (Since i trust both brands for amazing image quality).Canon EOS 500D Scored over Nikon in below areas:1. LCD Screen 3inch 920,000 dot compared to Nikon's 2.7inch 230,000. For me high resolution screen is very important to enjoy the pics in the camera itself and obviously for better judgement of the focus. I bet, you will fall in love with T1i, immidietly after seeing pics in its brilliant LCD screen.2. I verified both Ti1 and D5000 user interface and i felt T1i's user interface/menus were well organised keeping in mind of the entry level DSLR users. Again i love this on T1i.3. I have seen many people complaining about T1i's 1080 (20 FPS) HD video. But Nikon doesn't even have this feature. And T1i has HD video 720 at 30 FPS which is a treat to eyes when you see it on HDTV. But Nikon provides 720 at just 24 FPS.4. Both has Live View - Here T1i has the advantage of better resolution screen and D5000 has Lower resolution vari angle screen. My preferenece was high resolution screen.5. Image Quality, I am very very happy about the Super sharp images of Canon T1i. My interest is mainly Macro and Landscape. And T1i gives me Amazing Quality images (I don't believe much in camera reviews) combined with Canon's brilliant lenses.6. Canon's provides the best - with camera software package. Digital Photo Professional, EOS Utility, Photostitch and many more are very simple to use and powerful tools and provides necessary inventory for more than basic image editing (Don't compare this with specialized photo editing tools like Adobe Photoshop).7. Again Canon has the most comprehensive Lens set to choose compared to Nikon (Again don't bring in the theory of 3rd party lenses). I own the kit lens, Canon 100mm Macro, Canon 10mm super wide angle. And these leses combined with T1i produce breathtaking images.8. When it comes to performance, T1i has got very great start up time, fast focus and good continious burst (9RAW/170 JPEGS at 3.4 FPS) which satisfies my needs. Nikon D5000 can shoot at 4FPS.9. Cost wise, T1i is cheaper than Nikon D90 and Canon 50D.I have read many reviews comparing T1i and D5000, saying Nikon has better Low light performance. It may be true, but T1i produces brilliant pics till ISO3200 (Nikon may produce little better than this at same ISO range), but I use my  camera very less for low light photograpy and Canon T1i's JPEG quality in normal light is a very sharp, captures more detail due to its 15MP resolution and it is better than that of Nikon D5000.Handling wise i never felt T1i as bad. It has a great grip and due to its less weight, it is very portable compared to Nikon D5000.Final word:For my use/requirements Canon T1i fits perfectly and it produces Amazing Super sharp images with market leading feature set for an Entry level DSLR. T1i has many improvements compared to that of 450D XSi keeping the similar (Better JPEG quality - compared to both 450D XSi and 50D) image quality and it is way ahead of Nikon D5000.Hats off to Canon for giving a Brilliant Entry Level DSLR again.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not Too Shabby...", "Author": "AmazonBox@theDoor4Me", "ReviewID": "R3SICBTFP3L98Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this two days ago and was really unsure about the T1i. I've read what scant reviews existed on Amazon and became somewhat concerned about the complaints of soft images. In the brief time I tested it I noticed my shots were coming out soft as well compared to my S3. Then after toying around with the settings I found that the \"Standard\" profile's sharpness was set on low. Not having dug that deep into the menu system, I believe it was the default setting making the images really soft. I now have it on max, or near max, and am more satisfied with the images. While increasing sharpness, images remain really smooth even at high ISOs. Overall, I'm more satisfied with the unit now that I've got the image sharpening down. With that said I still have more deliberating to do.A note about video: I do enjoy having the video capability on the camera only because you can set the WB, unlike a Flip. I can't squeeze 1080 out of my system anyway so 720 works just fine. As others have pointed out, the autofocus is a bit odd to get used to but manageable in video.

They are essentially equally great with respect to image quality.2) Megapixel Count - 15 megapixels is indeed qualitatively better than 6 megapixels, but 15mp (t1i) and 12mp (5000D) from similar sized sensors is again not much real difference.  There are point and shoots with higher megapixel counts on tiny ccd sensors, doesn't mean they are better.  Again, image quality of the d5000 and t1i are both great and is no reason to pick one over the other.3) 1080p video - The t1i has it at 20fps, the d5000 doesn't have it at all.  But the 20 fps on the t1i renders this essentially pointless.  The human eye needs about 24fps for the illusion of smooth continuity.  If you will be using video, you can consider both 720p.Now for what I believe are valid but minor reasons to pick one over the other:1) LCD difference:  canon's is almost double the resolution and bigger, nikon's can swivel out.  I prefer the higher res and bigger size to the swivel.  The higher res is very important as you will be able to tell if a shot had problems that you couldn't at lower res.  This is really an important factor that is hard to emphasize in words but makes a huge difference once you see it.2) movie mode differences:  nikon d5000 is fully manual here including for the focus.  the canon is fully auto here including a pretty slow and disruptive auto focus.  For an SLR you WANT manual control, especially of aperture so you can control the depth of field to make videos that are less home video looking and more 'artsy'.  If you wanted full auto, get a point and shoot that does video.  Fortunately for canon, there are workarounds to be able to control aperture, but they are a hassle.  But my opinion is to get the Canon based on the auto focus.  It is not really useable during movie capture (loud slow and disruptive), but you can atleast use it before hand to get focus.  It brings quite a bit of convenience.  And you can look on the web for hack ways to manually control the aperture.  The Canon is also 30fps at 720p compared to 24fps at 720p for the nikon.  You can get a 25% slow motion effect with the canon without going under 24fps, where as with the nikon doing any slow motion will mean choppy frames (under 24fps).Everything else I feel comes down to personal factors like form factor, feel in hand etc.", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best technology for the money", "Author": "J. Retika \"jazz addict\"", "ReviewID": "R14Y5QM4E99BU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider myself an above average amateur, and I want to share why I decided to buy the T1i. I know the concept of white-balance, aperture, speed, and metering, and I've experimented with them on my Point & Shoot camera (Canon G2).My budget is in the $800-$1000 range, and I narrowed down my selections to Canon T1i, Nikon D5000/D90, and Pentax K20D. I wasn't worried too much about who has the best image quality. I felt that all 4 cameras (should) produce excellent results for most cases.I'm a big fan of technology, and I'm willing to spend money to get latest technology (well.. as long as it's within my budget). I mean, if I just want good quality image, I'd go with Nikon D40/D60 or Canon XSi.I based my decision on user reviews and professional reviews, dpreview.com and the like.Pentax K20D has weather sealed body and in-body image stabilization, but they're not must-have features to me. It's reported to have slow focus, which is a deal-breaker.Nikon D5000 has the same CMOS sensor as D90's, which has better DxOMark (better dynamic range, better low-light ISO) than Canon's 50D sensor, the same one in Canon T1i. But it only has 2.7-inch/230-kpixel LCD, not to mention 0.78x viewfinder magnification (compare to T1i's 0.87x).dSLR buyers be warned: you just don't use LCD for focusing, it's too slow. D5000's swiveling LCD is a hard sell to me.Nikon D90 has better sensor, and pentaprism viewfinder. It can capture more frames/second (4.5 vs T1i's 3.4). It also has more AF area (11 vs T1i's 9). I mostly use single-focus point, so more focus points is not that useful to me. I plan to experiment with RAW capture, and Nikon charges extra for its RAW converter software (NX2 $180 MSRP).For $799 (body only), I feel that T1i gives the best & latest dSLR technology for the money:3-inch 920-kpixel LCD, fast focus, free RAW converter software, latest DIGIC4, HDMI. 1080p/720p video is a bonus.I'm not too crazy for the 15-Mpix, but now when I take pictures,I don't worry much about zooming on my subject,knowing I can crop the image later.Again, all 4 cameras take excellent pictures.

Esquivel", "ReviewID": "R3KDXE5XCVM318", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The T1i (500D to me and the rest of the World) is my first DSLR camera. My digital cameras previous to the 500D consisted of Olympus' 570UZ, Canon's Powershot S70 and the (almost vintage!) Powershot S110. Given my  absence of experience with DSLRs, I obviously would have no real world basis to compare the 500D to other DSLRs.With that disclaimer out of the way, let me unequivocally state that I am absolutely thrilled with the quality of the pictures taken by the 500D, especially at night.I love night photography and it has been a continuing source of frustration for me that point-and-shoots, even advanced point-and-shoots like the 570UZ or the S70, have singularly so-so night photography performance, even on Manual mode where one is allowed to choose the ISO, shutter speed and aperture. The 500D convincingly erased that frustration. In fully automatic mode it takes absolutely goregous night photos at high ISO (usually 800 and occasionally @ 1600) and a very quick shutter speed with nary a hint of noise or blurring. (A guy I talked to concerning the night photography capabilities of the 500D and Nikon's D5000 commented that he found the Canon a more capable night shooter. I took his word with a grain of salt. Now, I absolutely believe him!) If there is one problem with the 500D's night capabilities on Automatic, it's that it tends to overlight the scene, which may not be what you want in certain situations. (For those kinds of photos, may I recommend \"Manual\" mode?)(Note: I have finally gotten around to posting sample night pictures taken during a recent trip to Madrid. Please do view the images to see what I mean.)I consider myself a mid-level amateur (I understand the concepts of shutter speed, ISO, aperture, white balance, etc.) but have not fully learned how to manipulate the different variables to great(er) effect. The 500D, however, makes it easy to learn. The menu is (more-or-less) intuitive and worded in plain (non-technical) English.  The \"Creative auto\" mode provides a good example of the use of simple, descriptive English.The LCD screen (@920000 pixels) is stunning. I compared the screen on the 500D with that in my 570UZ (@230000 pixels) and the difference between the two are indeed worlds apart.The 500D, however, is not as comfortable on the hand as my 570UZ. Also, the kit lens that comes with the 500D lacks the close-up and zoom capabilities of my 570UZ. (The 570UZ can take crisp pictures with the lens less than 1 cm from the object being photographed. Try that with the 500D equipped with the kit lens... you can't.) Which leads to one drawback to DSLRs... having to purchase separate lenses in order to do truly close-up and/or super zoom photography. Finally, the 500D is, of course, much heavier than an ordinary point and shoot.I have not used the video mode (for video, I'd recommend that one buy a dedicated video recorder not a DSLR).To sum up, the two main reasons why I love this camera:1. Stunning LCD; and2. Equally stunning night photography capabilities, even in full automatic!", "Date": "May 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "First time DSLR Buyer- Chose over Rebel XSi", "Author": "B. Stubblefield", "ReviewID": "R2T6ZAYJYXQ2QQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a first time DSLR owner. Took about three weeks to research before finally taking the plunge. If you are like me, you probably read about a hundred reviews from amazon, [...], cnet, consumer reports, and the like. Your head probably hurts by now. I'm going to try to make it as simple as possible. If you are in the market for a great entry level DSLR that you can grow into, and you don't have a budget that equals the gross domestic product of a small country, then you've probably been looking at the Canon XSi, some Nikons, and this guy.Why you should choose the T1i over the Rebel Xsi or Nikon:1. The screen is way better. There are 920,000 color dots on the 3\" screen. Your pictures look awesome even before you load them onto your computer. This is better than either the XSi or the Nikon 5000- both have 230,000 dots. It may not seem like it makes a difference, but it's like comparing a shiny new HDTV plasma to a CRT television of the 90s. There is a difference and you won't want to go back.2. Movies! You can record really high quality HD movies with the T1i, but you can't with the XSi. The Nikon has movie capabilities, but it stops at 1280 x 720 (24 fps). The T1i does 1920 x 1080 (1080P, 16:9) @ 20 fps (which is probably way bigger than you need). There have been some complaints about the microphone placement and overall ambient noise being caught in the video recording capabilities, but I've had the same problem making movies with my movie capable point and shoot. If you want to make a full length film, you probably need a camcorder. But this is more than capable of capturing things you happen across- like waterfalls, grandchildren playing, or puppies falling asleep. I found the movie capabilities  convenient (it's not hidden in some menu screen- there are dedicated buttons) and you can even take pictures in the middle of recording a movie if you see an awesome shot in the middle of filming.3. HDMI output. I didn't think this would be a big selling point, but it's pretty neat to plug the camera into your HDTV and see a big version of your pics and videos. The HDMI makes a huge difference in showing each hair on your dogs face; each leaf in a landscape scene. Could also be pretty impressive if you have to show a slide show at a party, etc. The HDMI cable is not included, but it's relatively inexpensive. There is an included cable that plugs into your television if you don't need the HD capabilities.4. Finally, and this is more a personal preference, but if this is your first DSLR you are buying into a whole family of products when you choose a brand. I was dead set against the whole idea of lugging all those lenses, accessories, and bodies around. But ultimately I was hitting a wall with my \"prosumer\" point and shoot, and needed to get to that extra step. There is a satisfying \"snappiness\" to the rebel series, and the t1i is an incredibly well built camera that will last a long time. It feels great in your hands, is the lightest of the three cameras mentioned above, and has technology that should stretch pretty far, considering that it was announced only a few months ago.It's worth the extra hundred or so dollars to get the t1i vs the xsi, since this is the newest model in the rebel series and makes enough improvements (movie mode, better screen, and the obvious 15.1mp vs 12.1 and 12.3) to warrant the step up if buying your first DSLR.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "I Love This Camera", "Author": "Tampa Dave", "ReviewID": "R1WE802DH8EW0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to go over the technical merits of this camera as they are well detailed in other posts.  I can speak only for myself.  I was really waiting for an affordable full frame D-SLR to come out.  However, this camera came out with great reviews and it has a great looking LCD screen as well as HD video and the latest DIGIC 4 image processor onboard.  So I went for it.I do not regret that decision at all.  Now, I may still get the full frame camera later, but in the meantime, I am enjoying this technological marvel.  My last camera was the Canon G6 and it served me well for a number of years.  But this T1i is the kind of camera I have been dreaming about owning for the past 40 years.I bought the EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS USM and EF 85mm f/1.8 USM lenses and I am now taking photos I never dreamed I could shoot.Oh yes, about the kit lens.  You either love it or hate it.  I am definitely on the \"love it\" bandwagon.  For many situations it does an excellent job.  Of the 3 lenses that I have the kit lens is the most versatile for shooting HD video because of it's wider FOV.  It can't match the other lenses I have for stills, but if the kit lens is all you have, it will do an excellent job for you.  Just give it a chance.There are so many little features on this camera that come in handy, like spot metering and mirror lock up to name a couple, that it becomes hard for me to believe they call this an \"entry level D-SLR.\"I like that the Mode Dial has Basic Zones like portrait, landscape, etc.  They come in handy when you need to shoot NOW and you can't remember fast enough what aperture, ISO or other setting is best for a shot.  When you have the time to think you can use the creative zone to fine tune your shots.The HD video is fantastic and it looks great on a HD tv.  The mono sound is o.k.  It works for me.  After all, I am not trying to make a Hollywood blockbuster or music video with this camera.  The video really is good.The included Digital Photo Professional software is fine.  If you don't have Photoshop you still can do some pretty decent basic photo processing with the included software.So what's not to like.  Well, I wish the live view would work in the Basic Zones.  It can't fetch the newspaper from the front yard, but I'm working on that. ;)Wish List:  Full frame image sensor  Higher continuous fps  Weather resistant sealing  More metal, less plastic in the body.I guess I could shell out another $1800 or more and I can get these wishes in the professional models.  But is it worth it?  You be the judge.All in all, this is a great camera package because it has great flexibility, tons of features, great video and adequate software for basic photo processing.  The Rebel T1i is an amazing value considering price and features.  And it does takes great pictures.I love this camera!Edited July 25, 2009", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with Video Capability", "Author": "Brad B. \"Brad\"", "ReviewID": "R3C1M66VDA0TLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ever since I was a Freshman in High School and even before then, I was interested in photography. I will never forget taking my first summer school class as an incoming freshman in photography and really falling in love with the art and the mechanics of it all. Naturally I borrowed equipment from my Dad (which I am sure was from the 1960's), and soon after was able to invest in my first SLR after mowing enough lawns. I really learned the art through Black and White photography, and then decided to minor in it in College, where I tried my hand at large format Black and White. Soon after graduation from college and making even more money, I bought my first New SLR, the Canon EOS elan IIe (I am looking to sell this if anyone is interested). This was 1999 and still the era of 35mm film. Digital however was making its ways into the scene, but I just bought what was a revolutionary eye tracking SLR camera. (I wish I had waited a few more years). A few years later I have a family and am on my second house now. Money isn't flowing like it once was as a bachelor, so research was king in my decisions when looking for a new SLR, now a DSLR. This brings me to the actual point where this past weekend I bought what I hope to be the camera that will help me revitalize my love I had for photography.For those who do not know, the T1i has two close cousins in the Canon Family, the 50D and the 5D Mark II. The 50D being the closest cousin to the T1i. Originally right before the news of the T1i, I was looking at purchasing the Canon XSi in which a friend of mine had purchased earlier. However, the news of the T1i peeked my interest for several reasons. First, it was new, it had to be good right? OK, it was the fact that this camera was the first sub $1,000 Canon DSLR with the DIGIC 4 image processor, which has lower noise, faster frames, and the capability of doing high definition video. Second, was the price point. I wanted a camera kit (with lens) for less than $1,000. Sad to say, but the 50D was out of my price range from the start, and that was without the lens, plus no video. Third, 15.1 mega pixels. I know, the marketing hype does work somewhat for me. The more mega pixels the better right . . . well, in this case, it is a larger sensor, so I was OK with a couple more mega pixels. Last, it was a Canon. I looked at all the competitive models, Nikon, Panasonic and Sony, but came back to the Canon, because I knew the interface from my previous job, which had a Canon EOS XT, and the fact that I had one previous Canon EF Lens from my Elan IIe days. To me, research showed me the Canon T1i was my next camera.Images ReviewLet me start this section with a little background. I think the first photo on every camera should be a picture of a flower, why, well, is shot decently, it will look nice, show the camera's tonal range, image sharpness, show depth of field, lens bokeh, and in my case let me know that the camera is working properly. In my case, after close review, I noticed several red dots on each and every photo I took, and in the exact same spot. After a lens change/cleaning, and numerous sensor cleanings, I realized the red dots were due to dead pixels on the sensor. All said and done, I was able to return mine for a new one with little questions asked.After all said and done, the images are were very clean with the auto focus and manual focus working very well, even in lower light conditions. I tend to shoot in aperture priority as I like to be able to compose my shots more than one with a point-and-shoot camera would. The camera was quick and responsive, as well as accurate when using the auto white balance. Some people have complained about soft images, and reporting that the lens is not that great for such a high mega pixel camera. I am not sure that that is a sound argument in that, One, there are smaller sensor point-and-shoot cameras with tack sharp images, and might I add, smaller, and cheaper lenses. And two, depending on the AF mode you are in, and a whole host of other variables, sometimes manual focus is just better.In all, I am extremely pleased with the images I have been able to make with this camera and lens kit. Even when testing this camera in several ISO ranges, the images showed little to no noise, and vibrant color.The VideoI will be the first to admit that the Video feature is an extra for me on this camera. I wanted the camera more for photography than video. It is in an essence, and extra feature that when I need it will be great to have it. That being said, the Canon shoots two different rates of HD video, 1080p 20FPS and 720p 30 FPS video. The problem is, the 1080p at 20 frames per second is practically unusable and a huge disappointment once the action or camera moves. There is a lot of jitter once something happens to move. I guess this would be great for still life or slow life movies, but then, why not use a still image if nothing is going to change? I think Canon in their infinite wisdom missed out on the \"Full HD\" idea. It needs to be usable. I would wish for an update to 1080p at 24 FPS, but I will not hold my breath on that.The 720p at 30 FPS video on the other hand is sharp and very usable video. I think the average video user will be more than happy with this configuration. I found very smooth panning was able to be accomplished, and moving objects did not have the same jagged, stuttering feel to them as in the 1080p video.Some overall drawbacks I noticed was the auto focusing noise on the video and the lack of an audio input jack. To start, The auto focus is a bit strange coming from a camcorder. Each time you want to focus using auto focus, you need to press and hold a button. This then makes the lens motor activate, and become a noise on the video because the microphone is placed near the lens. I have hear that if the lens were a Canon USM (ultrasonic) lens, this might be less of an issue. In any case, I think manual focus is a workaround for this for the time being until I test some other methods and/or lens configurations.As for the sound input methods, there is only one, and that is the mono pick-up microphone that is on the front of the camera. This comes to a little disappointment to me, because like I said the video feature is a nice odd-on feature for me, not the main reason I bought this camera. The sound is, well as good as mono sound will be. It works, but could and will be better as future camera versions evolve.In my overall viewpoint, the video features need some work from Canon. I would not buy this camera for the video. This is first and foremost a still camera with video capabilities. If you are looking for video first, look elsewhere.Final ThoughtsThe Canon T1i is a great camera with extensive options for the amateur to the pro. With the wide assortment of EF and EF-S lenses able to be used, one could go broke quickly. The camera is a little light for my taste, but adding a vertical grip to the bottom gives a weight that is more hefty. The lens that comes with the camera kit is a basic intro lens. I wish that it was a USM lens, because this lens is a bit noisy audibly. The lens is however image stabilized (IS) which is great for those without a steady hand, or shooting action. The camera will also work with several other Canon IS lenses giving you options galore.The color reproduction is accurate and vibrant and with the new DIGIC 4 image processing chip, low in noise. I find that shooting indoors at iso 800 and no flash will still produce great looking natural images. The white balance also works fairly well, but has some limitations. This is where the custome white balance feature shines. With a few clicks you can have every shot looking closer to the actual lighting you see through you eyes.Finally, I think Canon did a great job in making a sub $1,000 camera a hit. Personally I love it, and plan on keeping it for some time as I get back into photography. I would consider this a pro-sumer camera that isn't too hard for a knowldgable amateur or professional in need of a lighter street camera.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, but needed service twice within 2 months of ownership", "Author": "Marty Z", "ReviewID": "RTAHCG4K3ZFO1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera takes stunning quality photos.

It was, of course, a considerable increase in price ($350 to $700, body only), but seems well worth the cost. Along with the camera I also bought the Canon 18-200mm lens because I did not want to be constantly changing lenses.My overall impression in the last 6 weeks has been very positive. The photos are full of deep, rich colors, the images are clear and do not seem to have much distortion. I find I can take pictures at ISO 800 without any really noticeable noise and, when needed, even at 1600. The camera has a rich feature set and, in general, I have not been disappointed by much. On the positive side I found the following:1) The camera fits in my hands well and the buttons are all easy to reach and use when taking pictures,2) The auto-focus using the viewfinder works well (OK, this is a function of the lens, not the camera, but when taking pictures I tend to group both together),3) As I stated above I find the pictures up through ISO 800 to be clear and 1600 more than just usable,4) There seems to be much less shutter lag with this camera compared to my previous point-and-shoot,5) Write time to the memory is much shorter than with my Olympus,6) I love the ability to bracket my exposures so I can be reasonably sure I will actually get a decent picture,7) I have had a chance to use the continuous picture setting and it works very well,8) The HD movie mode (1280 x 720) takes excellent movies. This was important to me and was the reason I bought the T1i instead of the Olympus E-620,9) I like the ability to create and use my own set of menu items for most of the functionality I usually need,10) The battery life for the included battery is very good. I can usually take 600+ pictures without having to change the battery.There are, however, some things about this camera that I find disappointing:1) When taking panoramas using the optical viewfinder Canon provides a way to lock the exposure setting so subsequent pictures will be taken using the same setting. The manual tells you to push the * button and use it for subsequent pictures. This works well, but since the * button is co-opted as auto-focus when using Live View, there does not seem to be any way to lock the exposure when using Live View. Canon's suggestion is to use the fully manual mode and set the shutter speed and exposure that way. However since there is a way to lock the exposure when using the viewfinder it seems reasonable to expect there to be a way to do the same when using Live View. And there is not,2) The camera seems small to host the 18-200mm lens. The lens is so heavy that the camera ends up facing toward the ground all of the time when carrying it around. The lens has a lock on it to prevent it from \"creeping\" out to its full length and I use that all the time, but the weight of the lens for the camera seems high. Again, I know this is a lens issue, but it seems hard to separate from the camera,3) Auto-focus seems to not work as well when using Live View as when using the optical viewfinder. In low light situations when I have no trouble getting a focus lock with the optical viewfinder I often cannot get a lock when using Live View,4) As much as I like the videos that this camera produces, it uses the LCD screen when taking videos and I often find that the LCD to be almost useless in daylight because the LCD is so washed out by sunlight. Thus unless I am in some shade I cannot see the scene I am supposed to be taking making a movie of. And I have to trust that it will come out OK,5) The 15 MP picture size on disk is typically greater than 5 MB by default. This seemed a little large and I wanted to set the size slightly smaller. However the next smaller picture size is 8 MP. 8 MP seems small and 15 MP seemed large. I was hoping for something in between (perhaps 10 or 12 MP), but there is no intermediate size. I currently have the picture size set for 8 MP but I would like something a little larger than half the full size.While these items are somewhat of a disappointment for me I have to say that overall this is a great camera. It takes great pictures that are sharp and full of color, it handles well, focuses quickly and takes and writes pictures very quickly. I am glad to have bought it and recommend it to anyone who, like me, is moving up to their first DSLR. And, as large and heavy as it is, I also recommend the 18-200mm lens. Its size is more than made up for by the convenience of not having to change lenses all the time.I would have liked to give this camera about 4 1/2 stars, but since I cannot give partial stars I am giving it 4 stars because of the items I listed above.

I've been eyeing the Canon 50D and was so close to buying one when I heard of the T1i. So I compared notes and found the T1i was nearly identical to the Canon 50D minus a few things I couldn't really notice (or care about) since I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about photography.After reading what few reviews there were on the internet because this item was new, I decided to take the plunge and buy this camera and lucky me, I ordered it the day it was released to the world so it came quickly!The results? I LOVE IT! But before I say more...Now, if you're a big guy like me who has BIG HANDS, YOU WILL WANT THE BATTERY GRIP that is extra. TRUST ME... It's a no-brainer... get it because it will make the camera feel so much better and make it look even more professional!That, and the battery grip comes with 2 extra 1800mA batteries which will give you a total of 3 batteries all together. I've been playing with it for several days and still haven't made a dent in draining these batteries!How's it operate? GREAT! Let me go into more detail...It's got several settings that I will sum up for you in Regular English, not Geek speak because I wish more people would speak this way instead of beating around the bush...It's got old fashioned digital camera settings (you know the little icons of the flower or mountain, sports guy, etc) so if you know how to use these settings, you'll be able to use this quickly and comfortably.It's got a full auto mode (which I like to call \"No Brainer Mode\") because this feature is a no-brainer! You just shoot and let it think for you! It will do EVERYTHING for you and do an incredible job! (NICE  :-D)And it's got the Advanced Modes so if you are a pro or want the controls of a professional camera (you know, to change the ISO settings or F-stops, etc) You can do that too!They really put a lot of thinking into this camera and its nice, inside and out. One of the things I've discovered that's extra credit is the software that comes with it called Digital Photo Professional.If you've read some of these reviews that talks about a picture maybe soft somewhere or the ISO noise (for whatever reason)... Digital Photo Professional has some sweet settings that will get rid of that for you and enhance your pictures to STUNNING!There's so much potential in this camera and remember, it's made by the same folks who made the 50D and all the other versions! So what if its got minor tweaks that others don't... the bottom line is that this is an incredible camera!I'm not crazy about the \"Rebel\" name in it because it makes it sound Amateurish... This should be called The Canon EOS AWESOME T1i because it looks, feels and is just that!Even better is the High Definition Video you can record if you want to. Sure its not equal to a dedicated HD camcorder but its nice to have if you want to record something important and look sharp too! Personally, I can't tell the difference between the 1080p and 720p so don't let these little nit-pickers bother you.Go with your gut and DO GET A GOOD LENS to compliment the one it comes with. Your next best bet is to get a 28mm to 200mm LENS so you can do those zoom and up close shots.With so many lenses, it will just open up all kinds of creative things you can do. I hope my review answered your questions! I'm glad I bought it and look forward to all the possibilities! So if you're looking to be a professional, this is a great start!

MCKICHAN", "ReviewID": "R1Z408Q04VZDZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider myself to be more of a technophile then photographer. Every year I seem to pick up a new camera as the manufacturers add megapixels, more zoom, video, HD video, etc... to what I bought the year before at the same price point. I've picked up enough photography skills through out the years just playing with my new toys every year to have a moderate understanding of photography by now. Cameras are also utilized for part of my job where resoulution, zoom, and ability to get quickly on target is important. The advances in technology just in the last 3-4 years are amazing in what you can do with a small camera and the price you pay to do it.That being said the T1i was my choice this year for my upgrade. (Last year was the Olympus E-510 which I got a great deal on as a year old model and the year before that a panasonic FZ18). Having the option to shoot both pics and video has been a big benefit for me at work and when shooting at home. The FZ18 is still my work staple although the now two years newer FZ35 is looking tempting. As far as what the panasonic bridge cameras can do in good outdoor lighting, it is very similar to what either of my DSLR's can do, and I would say the same thing for zooming outdoors. If you are looking for a great walk around outdoor camera to take daylight pics and video with I would recommend the panasonic series handsdown and you will come out several hundreds of dollars ahead. The upper level superzoom bridge cameras now have many of the manual functions the DSLR's do and do some nice burst shooting as well. Panasonic video is decent.What a DSLR will give you is much better indoor, portrait, and lowlight shooting. It also allows you to better implement and use advanced skills. The trade off being the higher price of the body, larger size of the body/lens, high priced lens, flashes, etc.... No DSLR accessory is cheap. The DSLR will also require you to better understand photography and especially depth of field, shutter speeds, etc...The T1i is a nice camera with a beautiful screen and easy to understand menu. The kit lens I would say is just OK. The build quality of the camera body (based on feel in the hand, heft, and visual inspection) seems better then the entry level Nikons and Canon XS, but my E-510 seems to be a more solidly built unit. Ditto for the kit lenses with neither brand of kit lens being all that great, but I think the Olympus lenses take better pictures. However more lens options exist for the Canon both from Canon and third party sources. As Amazon had a good package price at the time I purchased the T1i, I also picked up the 55-250mm IS lens, which I prefer over the kit offering. (I also have the basic 70-300mm Olympus lens which is similar in price to the Canon 55-250mm, and again appears to have a better build in the same price range.)Indoors the Canon has a better ISO range then the E-510, but both take pictures that look very detailed and there is little if any noticeable difference betwen them quality wise in good indoor lighting or using the flash. Outdoors in low lighting the Canon beats the Oly. The Canon also has a better autofocus system and focuses better in low light. At zoom ranges I think the 5 megapixel difference is noticeable as the Canon with lens at 250mm resolves the same level of detail when fully zoomed as the Olympus does with the fully zoomed 300mm (basically a 400mm equivalent zoom vs. a 600mm, so I think that is impressive.) Both give you a better picture then the FZ18 when you hit the shot, but I think the auto mode for the bridge camera gives novice shooters more consistent results then the DSLR's. Part of that may be when you get a good DSLR pic you really know it, and when you are just a little off it is easy to see it is missing that DSLR \"pop\". Those up close or zoomed \"potraits\" is where even a very new photographer will realy notice the difference when stepping up to a DSLR. That and the lack of picture noise due to the larger sensor. (If this is a family camera purchase and you plan on rarely using a tripod, I would always recomending getting either image stabilized camera body such as the Olympus or make sure you are getting the Canon IS lenses and not the ones without. It really does make a big difference in what you can do with the camera as a novice or amateur photographer.)As a still camera the T1i is an excellent choice especially if you are getting your first DSLR. If still pics alone are your primary concern though I would say you can get a less expensive DSLR such as the Xsi or E-620 and spend difference in price on better lenses. The T1i is the same price as I paid for my E-510, the two kits lenses it came with, and the 70-300mm zoom lens. I know that some of the differences I mentioned above are due in part to the 2 model year difference in cameras and that those differences would be lessened in the less expensive current model year cameras.Video however was one of the biggest reasons I went with the T1i. There are just some moments that are nice to capture with video and audio rather then just still pics alone. That you can now have the ability to do that in a limited way, while getting DSLR quality stills is great. Carrying one camera is better then carrying two to do the same thing. I would rate the T1i's video as OK for what it is. Indoors it does shoot with lower noise then a smaller sensored camera would, but the lack of lighting indoors still hurts it as it does all video cameras. I am not sure if a Canon camcorder hot shoe light would work on the T1i or not. If it did I would give Canon props. Outdoors in good light it does better. Where the DSLR gives you a lot of variety in how you shoot still pics it is limited in being able to do the same thing right now with video. A dedicated HD camcorder will still serve you better for taking shots of scenes in which the focus and range rapidly change and where you need to shoot long sessions at one time. The T1i is not designed to shoot video for extended periods due to the generation of heat which degrades image quality and per the manual will likely give you an overheating warning after about an hour or so of extended use and I think may shut the camera down. (I think the same thing would happen if you set up the camera in live view mode for that long as well). So setting it up on a tripod to record say your kids basketball game is not what it is capable of doing. If you are like me though and find that most video you shoot of everyday events is only a few minutes long at most, this will work. I have been using the 720p video most of the time as the 1080 doesn't handle motion well. I also found that a class 6 card or better (again as the manual states) is a requirement for good 720p video. (a class 4 will work, but you will notice dropped frames and artifacts from its inabilty to keep up with the flow of data. The class 4 works for still shooting just fine although it may lessen some lengthy burst shooting).I gave this camera 5 stars because you really do get a lot for what you pay. Yes it has limitations in the video mode but when you think about what you get for around $750 in this unit vs. what the same amount of money would have gotten you just 2-3 years ago I think it is a great camera. It takes excellent still pics, and OK HD video. If you have a DSLR that is 2-3 years old and are primarily interested in still pics, I won't say I would upgrade. And like I said above, even if this is your first camera and don't care about video there are less expensive choices for getting great still pics. If it is your first DSLR and you do want the option to do some videos (same with upgraders) there isn't anything better out there right now and this is definetly the way to go. Torn between this and an HD camcorder that will take still pics I would say that the video the T1i shoots (with-in its limits) is a much better secondary option then the still photos a camcorder takes. I have taken a nice HD camcorder on a trip before and relied on its still pics and would have liked to have had what the T1i offers over that, even when considering the larger size of T1i.Update: A month in and still getting a lot of use out of the camera. Other then xmas card pics, the E-510 has stayed on the shelf. Have used it to record 3 xmas programs and xmas day events. Video has been very good as have the stills.

I'd been plotting an upgrade for months, and was mainly considering the T1i, and 40D/50D line. I like the small size of the rebel, and was excited that the new T1i shared so many traits with the 50D--MP count, similar sensors, etc. I thought that would finally make the decision a no-brainer.I ended up returning the camera a week later. Don't get me wrong--there is a whole lot to love:--shooting video with great boekh is lots of fun,--the new LCD is glorious--the build gives at least the impression of a much more professional feelThat said, for me it all comes down to image quality. Here, I was sorely disappointed--in my tests I experienced very poor ISO performance. I almost never use flash, preferring to use good lenses with high apertures and these photos were significantly noisier than even my humble Xti shots when pushed above ISO400! According to what I've read on boards subsequently, this is due to largely to squeezing 15 megapixels into the sensor, and it is equally an issue on the 50D, which has led some to recommend sticking with the 40D until this is resolved in a future model. Another consequence of this 15mp sensor is the loss of RAW headroom, which means that recovering clipped highlights in Camera RAW afterward is much less successful. I was sorely disappointed. Also, in general, I felt plagued by soft images.So, I'd say enjoy this for what it is--a great camera with significant flaws in certain areas that are key for certain types of photographers. In my case I ended up biting the bullet and going to the 5Dmkii, mainly because I really loved the video capability. For most, however, if video isn't a big draw, then in my opinion you'd probably be happier with the Xsi's images (and price).", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Investment", "Author": "M.

I even used to take a load of pictures at rock concerts, had interchangeable lenses, a variety of lenses... well, you get the 'picture'. I was a 'professional' amateur. Flash ahead to the 1990's and on, I have a family and start to look for new gadgets. I owned several point and click cameras over the past 20 years, concentrating mainly on small sizes and portability. I loved the fact that I could slip these cameras into my pockebook and pack up the kids to the park (without a huge camera bag). Unfortunately, the pictures were 'ok' but nothing like the quality I had when I owned the old fashioned SLR. Well, now that I am 50'ish and my kids are grown and gone, I figured I would treat myself to a new camera, in particular this Canon Rebel. All I can say is 'wow'! I love it, love it, love it. Having owned it for over a year now (bought it on Amazon but just never got around to writing a review), I have purchased several interchangeable lenses and even a separate flash (although it comes with it's own built in one, I prefer to control the flash myself). The Canon Rebel gives me the quality of the pictures I was used to and with the stabilization, my pictures come out clear and focused every time. I have even started going back to concerts (ok, so they are the same artists I was following when I was much younger) and I am feeling like a pro again.

I got a sweet deal on Amazon last Xmas; a Canon XSi 18-55 kit plus a 55-250 IS zoom for only $100 more -- that's $150 off! I was pleased with the XSi, which I rated 5 Stars, with a few caveats. I found the camera easy to master and took some decent pictures... [...]Then, in April, Canon addressed all my XSi caveats with the released of the T1i -- HD movie mode, high ISO, hi-res LCD display, advanced firmware, DIGIC 4 processor, more megapixels. For a price spread of around $250 the decision to trade up was a no brainer. I sold the XSi kit at a $50 loss and bought a T1i kit.I beg to differ with those reviews that depict a T1i as EOS 50D with movie mode stuffed into a XSi body. That's a good description of the T1i's tech specs but it doesn't take build quality into account. The T1i is more attractive, more comfortable, has a better fit and finish, and feels more solid than the XSi. It's also more responsive, more feature rich, and I believe it takes better pictures.Though the T1i and XSi share the same footprint, the grips are wrapped differently. The textured foam on the front of the T1i wraps around the lens. It is cut at an arbitrary right angle on the XSi which has led to numerous complaints about the XSi grip. The T1i has remedied this with better ergonomics and better aesthetics. As one who has handled both, I can definitively state the T1i feels much better in my hand.The T1i has a rugged peach fuzz surface that the XSi lacks. It's smudge free and dust free, whereas the XSi is a smudge and dust magnet. The T1i has a richer feel to the hand than a XSi. There are added touches like a molded EOS badge on the T1i that is stamped on the XSi. No doubt about it, the T1i is a more refined, powerful, and attractive camera.I could rave on about the 900,000 dpi display, the HD movie mode, the high ISO, the DIGIC 4 menus, but I'll leave that to others.

It's my first DSLR, and perhaps you too are considering making the jump from the point-and-shoot.Which camera to get?When buying a DSLR, the lenses matter much more than the camera body- and will probably cost you much more as well.  These lenses will lock you into a system -- either the Canon, Nikon, or Sony system likely. Consider what cameras your family and friends are using and who you could potentially be sharing lenses with. Lenses generally cost $[...] to $[...], so it's a big deal.  Photography is a budgeting game.The next thing to consider is whether you want an entry-level or medium-level camera.  I'm new to DSLRs and wanted something inexpensive that I could learn to handle properly.  I also want to be able to carry the camera around in the rain or snow for example and not worry too much about protecting it. But image quality is important too, and so I wanted the \"latest\" model.The bodyAt 15 megapixels, the image quality is as much as you'd expect from Canon. There is low noise and the colors are vibrant. They supposedly crammed the higher-end Canon 50D sensor into this one, which probably isn't true but true enough to be believable.As for live-view mode, it's pretty messy to use since it requires pressing a lot of buttons.  Still, it comes in handy sometimes and I think their \"quick-focus\" mode is better than Nikon's slower digital focusing.  If you're really into live-view mode, consider the Sony Alpha series -- but know they have a smaller lens selection.The camera does somewhat limit your manual options, reflecting its target entry-level audience.  For example, I can't seem to get the camera to center-focus with evaluative exposure metering. But there are workarounds, and all cameras have their peculiarities that you get to understand.The 500D is one of the first entry-level DSLRs to feature HD video.  At first, I didn't think I'd use video much -- after all, I'd get a camcorder if I wanted that.  But the captured quality is HD and really looks nice, so I began to use it.  Video captures the mood of a place much better than some artsy photo with blurry bokehs. Your options are 1080p at 24fps, or 720p at 30fps. I use 720p/30fps, which is already high-quality enough for me. Especially when it comes to processing the videos, I don't want to wait forever -- I think online video sharing sites like Youtube only play video back at 720p anyways. The recent h264 encoding makes life much simpler with smaller file sizes.  On videos though, you will likely have to use manual focusing -- so your videos won't be perfect, but they can help add to your memories.The 18-55mm lens.It's actually a pretty decent lens.  If you are a beginner, it's a good deal for a lens that you don't have to care too much about -- one you can use in the rain or snow for instance.  There's no real problem with the lens, although later I picked up a Tamron 18-270mm lens for about $[...] more.ConclusionSo far, I'm pretty happy with this camera. It's a relatively low-cost Canon with really fantastic picture quality, along with HD video. The fact that it's a Canon means I have access to many top-notch lenses. The 18-55mm kit-lens is also quite good and covers decent range. As an APS-C sized camera, the size is smaller and the price cheaper. And video recording is actually a lot of fun.See sample photos/videos:[...]", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera but mediocre lense", "Author": "Srini P", "ReviewID": "R1MMAW88Z4CM83", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had this camera for abt 2 months and took more than 1000 pictures in various setting and conditions.

It was great at $800, and it's even better at $200 lessI've been using the T1i regularly since I got it around June last year - my current shutter release count is 6372.  I had to get the version with the included cheap zoom, which I was fortunate enough to sell for the $100 it added to the kit cost.  I have used only three lenses on it (I tried the cheap 28-90mm III from the film days for a few shots), and only two regularly - the 50mm f/1.4 and the new TS-E 17mm f/4L.  First I learned to shoot with the 50 (which seems to overexpose a bit, leading to bright, cheery portraits) and the 17mm.I'd never used a SLR (let alone a DSLR) before this, and just had messed around with a few other smaller digital cameras.  Coming off the ancient Sony F707, the ergonomics of this camera were astonishing.I've already had a couple photos of mine used in a medium-sized banner.  In good lighting conditions, you can easily take great photos, and with the right lenses you rarely need flash.  Simple.The viewfinder doesn't show you everything that will be in the final image (the edges aren't all visible), so you often must use Live View.  The screen is a godsend, and I didn't realize how useful it was until I got my TS-E 17mm f/4.  Live view is to DSLRs as the ground glass is to large format view cameras.  The screen is \"only\" 640x480 (and 3 inches - both best-in-class or darn close), but with 5x and 10x (pixel-level) \"magnification\" modes you can use the d-pad to move about the image, and you can see many fine details and critically focus in a way that would be impossible with the viewfinder, even after carefully adjusting the diopter.  The only problem is that Live View tends to shut off too quickly for my liking.The bad:  I wouldn't have preferred to buy a 17mm lens with a fragile bulb on the front and susceptibility to flare just to get a 28mm equivalent tilt-shift lens (though that is a good investment regardless).  On the other hand, the 50mm's perspective on the T1i is similar to an 80mm in film terms due to the crop sensor, making it a very good camera for portraits - and not quite as big and obvious as a full-size camera might be (though I found the T1i and 50mm combination still garnered lots of attention in some settings).  The tradeoffs between full-frame and crop sensors have been covered extensively elsewhere, but in this price range (and even further, as with the much more expensive 7D) you don't have any choice.  Enjoy the longer lenses, and if you absolutely must have the widest coverage possible, there are EF-S lenses made for this range (like the zoom starting at 10mm).I found myself fighting with the pop-up flash until I started using the Aperture Priority, Time Value, and Manual modes in addition with manual ISO.  The other spots on the dial are basically wasted clicks for me, and I usually prefer they were used with something else (though the Closeup mode still gets used occasionally).  That said, comparing the difference between how the automatic modes liked to interpret a scene with how I would set it up manually has made me more careful and knowledgeable.  Quite often the manual modes will ruin a scene, but likewise there's not a lot of merit in just pegging the aperture priority to 8 and ISO to 100 and wondering why your shots take forever and still look noisy.  I find the manual modes tend to do better when a thin depth of field is called for (then again, I was learning with the 50mm which is renowned for its thin depth of field).This camera really cries out for the fastest lenses you can find, because I find that the ISO performance is horrible in no-light situations.  Now, that's relative:  Most of the time the camera does brilliantly; sunsets should be no problem.  But night photography, even with relatively fast lenses, is tough (though it's tough to begin with).  Exposures more than 10 seconds result in hot pixels, which appear as nasty bright points of light (though dust can cause similar effects).  Of course, I'd rather have the extra pixels instead of a lower-resolution but less grainy sensor - I'm not dedicated to macro-, astro-, or night photography, and downsampling is underrated as well.The video mode is a great extra.  It's no replacement for a dedicated camcorder for professionals, I'm sure, but honestly for Youtube (for example) I don't think you can do much better and the flexibility has me venturing into (very amateur) cinematography in addition to still images, which is wonderful.  My major gripes with the video are:a.) Videos are short, limited by the 4GB limit per video.  Then again, Youtube knocks this down further to 10 minutes (a bit shorter than the longest single take possible with the T1i) and 2GB, at this writing.  Unless you're trying to recreate Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rope,\" though, I doubt you need an unbroken take.b.) ISO performance again - at night, everything but light sources will appear to have ants running all over it.  It's not a deal-breaker but it is generally distracting.  There's also the potential for nasty moire effects (so stay away from airplane propellers).c.) It tends to overheat - I had a lot of trouble trying to do some video in August as the camera kept quitting on me, and it wasn't even a hot day.d.) Obviously the ergonomics aren't perfect, but you can look into the famed \"$14 Steadycam\" [sic] for a solution.  A nice, fast zoom lens with a quiet manual focus ring (such as the L series provides) should work fine; otherwise, you can use a cheap zoom and just dub over the noise of zooming and focusing.  The L series lenses may sound like overkill to most, but keep in mind that you can get a great lens for really not much more than the value of the camera, and you'll be able to use it for some years to come on future SLRs.I haven't noticed any undue \"jello\" wobble effect in video, even when handheld, but I haven't critically reviewed all my handheld videos, either.The 1080p / 20 Hz format is a joke, but I don't see that as a problem as 720p @ 30Hz is great for 'net video.I've already alluded to it, but the microphone isn't perfect - it's only mono, recessed into the body of the camera, and while very sensitive it is omnidirectional and picks up sounds from anything mechanical in the camera.  It's not bad - it doesn't sound like putting your ear to a solid surface, say - but you need a quiet lens and quiet breathing if you're going to zoom or focus when shooting video.  On the plus side, it makes commenting while taking video very easy since your voice will be picked up just as well as if you were speaking directly into it.  On the whole, I like the mic, but folks who need a shotgun condenser microphone are going to hate it.You've heard this before, but the wide range of Canon lenses available really mix up your video options, and the tilt-shift lenses in particular allow some amazing effects for video that you can't find elsewhere:  Cheap (certainly by video standards) interchangeable lenses + limited view camera movements + fast primes and good zooms = oh yeah.  The TS-E 17mm f/4 isn't quite fast enough for shooting broadcast-quality on the T1i in darkness (as I discovered with the noise occasioned by high gain), certainly not as well as the 5D Mark II does, but the longer tilt-shift lenses should start to get there (particularly the older 45mm and 90mm models).Some handy basics I discovered that shouldn't be forgotten (aside from shooting in RAW, which is incredibly useful for me when doing fine art style photography, but this is a decision which every person must make for themselves; casual snapshot shooters ought not to worry too much about it):1.) Look for the preview time setting.  I turned the preview off entirely, since it's easy to hit the Play button to quickly view the last picture and go back to shooting.2.) Don't forget to adjust the diopter on the viewfinder to match your eyesight.3.) When needed, hit the left directional button to bring up the option for delayed shutter release, so you can take a picture on a tripod without moving the camera (even pressing the button can do that).  Unfortunately, you can't reduce the time below 2 seconds.4.) Don't use the basic modes if you can help it - the flash loves to come up at bad moments and you can't use many important basic features.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon Leads Again", "Author": "Richard Hohn \"Rixtar\"", "ReviewID": "R2JAS9B2X6JMPF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As someone who has been shooting Canon EOS cameras since the 1980's I can safely say without a doubt that the Canon T1i is easily the most advanced camera under $1000.  I showed this camera to my Nikon and Pentax friends and they were in awe of not only its picture quality but also the features.  It is a pretty straight forward camera with those little Canon touches that have been around for years like the sports mode and portrait mode.  In fact, if you are considering your very first DSLR, you will not find one that is more intuitive or easier to understand right out of the box.  It took Nikon, Minolta (now Sony) and Pentax literally years to come up to Canon's autofocus lens capabilities and even today, very few can argue against a Canon Lens' image quality for price ratio.  The standard lens in the kit is the best yet of the inexpensive lenses.  It has a handy image stabilizer and focus fairly quickly.  The on-camera flash is sufficent for snapshot photography and fill-in duty but you will need to consider a 480EX II or a 580EXII flash for the best results.  For the money, this is the best yet and Canon is the world-wide preferred brand of DSLR cameras.

I got a second battery along with the camera, which it was great, but I never had to switch batteries on a same day or trip. Considering that I went to London in the winter (the battery life is always shorter in the cold) and the battery lasts almost my whole trip. I took a whole bunch of pictures because I was just testing my new camera.Tips:- Get a second battery just in case, though its battery doesn't take that long to charge and lasts a long time- get UV filter to protect your lens, even the cheap ones, at least you know that your lens is safe.- take off the filter for night shots with a lot of lights ot they will ruin your pictures.- if you are still not sure if you want get this camera go to flickr and examine some samples ;)- Get its manual for Dummies, it helps a lot- Buy it from Amazon, they were great. I bought it for my trip and I only had a week before my departure, so i call Amazon costumer service and they said I would have to cancel my order to have the shipping speed changed, but since I bought it with an international credit card I would lose money on the transaction, so they had it shipping 2-day shipping for free, just for understanding my needs. I love Amazon Costumer Service. If there is any problem with your camera you are safe with Amazon.This is a small camera comparing to other SLR but if you are new in the SLR camera world you really don't need to go with the big fancy cameras, this camera has plenty of possibilities to explore different set ups, but it's still easy to use.I hope this was somehow helpful.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Our first DSLR.

For whatever reason, every year we buy a nicer/ better point and shoot camera for our vacation.  The last one was a Lumix waterproof/ HD video point and shoot camera.  While those take very good pictures, we wanted more as they never seem fast enough.  I decided this holiday was the time to make it a gift and so we could take it on vacation to Disney World.When we opened it and started playing with the kit lens, it was night and day vs. a point and shoot.  It is very easy to take photos right out of the box and it just took pictures faster and better.  There are plenty of settings and buttons to play with, but that will take time and experience to really learn how to use this camera. Here is where I wish I did something different.First of all, this becomes a VERY expensive hobby.  The kit lens only goes so far.  It basically gives you 3X's the zoom when compared to point and shoots.  Obviously, that is not enough for us when we go on vacation anywhere.  We went to a large dedicated camera store to look at lens options and found a huge amount of different lenses and brands.  Based on price point and features, we chose a Sigma 18-200mm lens that gives you ~ 11x's zoom.  This was a good all around lens as I didn't want to have to constantly swap out a lens for every parade or landscape shots.  You never know what you'll see and changing out to a telephoto lens is not convenient.  Now after a new lens, extra battery, waist bag and book bag I've easily totaled over $1400.In the end I'm sure the supplied kit lens would be sufficient for a lot of people.  If you need more than 3x's zoom, than just buy the body and research for a lens that will better suit your needs.

It's much lighter than the Canon 50D, considering that with the added lens the 500D weighs about the same as the 50D body by itself. The body is smaller than the 50D, so it's alot easier to carry around for travel. We already had a couple of Canon Powershot point and shoot cameras and the controls are very similar so it is very easy to use because were were already familiar.

Menu system altough a little difficult is not that bad.  I'm the type of person who does not usually ready manuals but with this I did.  It was for the most part easy to understand (and with that stated if you are a novice and do not understand any more than point the camera and push the button stop once you have read the basic settings, you will be to overwhelmed by the advanced settings even though they explain it very well they do not explain what it means and the situations you would want/not want to use these features.  Take an online photography course or purchase a book about SLR photography first and you will get much more enjoyment and use, otherwise you would probably just end up returning it.  It's a little like algebra it looks like something foreign and once it's explained in a broken down manner it's very simple).I also purchased a class 6 sd card cause the selling point of this camera was the HD video.  However I have yet to try it out.  The fact that it only does 1080p at 20 frames is a little disappointing but I will get over it.  The included software which allows you to shoot and view via usb cable is a nice feature although I don't see many instances where I would use it (the fact that it allows you to choose where to store in this mode is nice).Now coming from a Nikon SLR (yes the out dated N80), which I always liked the brand better was a little difficult.  However not much is all that different once you understand how everything is layed out.  I think with this camera Canon just may have one me over to their side.  Plus it doesn't hurt the price is a little better.Now given there are some flaws, some of which could easily be fixed with a firmware update.  The biggest is battery life, and these little batteries are expensive ranging from $40-$75 depending on where you shop.  I have found so called OEM batteries for as low as $14 but I am a little wary of using them in such a expensive and sensitive investment.  I think anybody even a novice who gets this camera should have at least 2 if not 3 extra.  Also though the battery grip is expensive it doubles the battery life and also can take 6 AA batteries in a pinch (excellent idea for a place like Disney where you could easily wear through the batteries).  The only other major flaw that I have found that makes this camera not so great for the novice a.k.a. the spouse is that live mode only works in creative and custom modes.  I can see her saying now, don't bring that big thing cause I don't know how to use it and I hate looking through the view finder.  Although very minor, and yes the live view does cut battery time in half it makes the camera less diserable to someone who knows little about photography.  Im not in anyway knocking this camera I just think it's fair to tell someone who may not be aware of it's limitations.I would say it's much like a car.  Don't expect to walk in and pay the base sticker price.  You need/have to have some of the extras otherwise your just not going to enjoy it (and im not saying to go out and buy everything they make for it but there are a number of things I think you should/need to have).  I would think regardless of the price of the body and if it comes as a regular kit you should still plan on spending $300-$800 extra.  Your gonna want a telephoto lense in the range of 70-200mm or greater, at least one extra battery, a camera bag, and you SHOULD 100% get a UV lense (not only will your outside pictures turn out better it protects your lense for $15, i'd rather spend that than have to replace a scratched lense), external flash is nice but I wouldn't bother if you are a novice, I would recommend getting at least 1 sdhc card rated at class 6 (4 or 8 gigs) and finally a lense pen for cleaning the OUTSIDE lense only (do not and I repeat DO NOT try to clean any internal parts, you will kill the camera).

Truly awesome resolution for checking your shots right away.2.  Weight: feels pretty light to me.3.  Black and white option.  nifty.  avoid post production conversion4.  Easy to use, just pull it out of the box and start playing.  (my two and a half year old can hold it and take a picture on auto)5.  This kinda goes along with number 1, but the manual setting numbers show on the lcd (that is huge) and they are big, so you can reference them quickly and accurately.  i actually prefer this over the tiny screen above the shutter button on the 50d.Cons: (i had to think hard on this one)1.  It's a bit pricey.  I am just being honest.  for someone who takes pics of their baby and dog primarily...I would perhaps recommend a less expensive Canon DSLR like the XTi or other with a more expensive lens.2.  The kit lens.  Not my favorite.  I bought it because I thought with the Image Stabilization that it would be better but it is a bit slow in focusing, tends to get kinda iffy about where it is focusing sometimes.  (you can have the red blinking light all lined up and STILL not be in focus).  Also, it is not great for low light situations.  All of that said, it is an awesome lens for outside on a sunny day.3.  This one is actually my own fault.  15 mega pixal photos?  ARE ENORMOUS!  They are like 6 meg apiece and that means you have to do some post production work shrinking them to send them to grandparents and friends.  and uploading to photo sharing sites like Shutterfly?  takes a while.  plan to plug in and walk away for some time if you have more than about 20 pics.So this may sound negative but i love this camera in real life.  it's easy to use and almost always gives me great photos.  my bottom line is this though:  unless you NEED 15 mp, opt for something less expensive and get yourself a little 50mm lens to go with it.", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Bullminator \"1080P\"", "ReviewID": "R1T8ZLA88F4AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the Rebel Xt.

How?\" I don't really know, but I have to say even with the same lenses that have just been used on its counterpart, I tend to just find myself liking the footage I've garnered with the T1i a little better, more often than not. I notice less noise in medium to low light conditions, I notice better color trueness and richness, and even though it is a mono audio signal, it is usually pretty much the equivalent of the T2i just processing the same signal into 2 L&R; channels.

Give it to me!\"  SO...... we just ordered a SECOND T1i (a motivated woman can find money, TRUST me!) for him, with overnight shipping, in hopes that we'll have it by his next day off (Saturday).For Christmas I had asked for a DSLR camera for Christmas.  My father taught me how to shoot a 35mm and do macro photography when I was in high school, and bought me my own SLR camera as a young adult.  When I couldn't afford my own darkroom, etc., over time I finally went to digital point-and-shoots because they were affordable - no film, no developing.  However, when I went to do macro with a point-and-shoot, frequently it would aim behind, or before, and I would have to go out to normal, switch back to macro, try again...  taking macro shots of small flowers, etc., was aggravating and ruined my fun.  After two different summer vacations with float trips and a total lack of good macro photography, I sadly admitted to my new husband that all I REALLY wanted for Christmas was a DSLR camera.  Since we're older and have to be more careful (we only do purchases like this cash) with finances, I actually shopped cheap, even finding a close-out several years old never sold by Wal-mart Olympus and began researching it to see if I could work with it.  Hubby encouraged me to learn a little more about DSLR's with internet research and I read him some highlights and once again suggested that he divide up whatever was budgeted for ME for Christmas amongst our grown children or the grandkids.Hubby, unfortunately, is a bit of a Luddite.  He never figured out his Blackberry before it DIED and then went back to a Nokia brick phone.  This makes me a LITTLE worried about him having his own T1i, because it might NEVER get out of automatic mode, but at least he'll be happy and leave me alone with mine.  This, however, contributed to his choice of camera.  He went to Wal-mart and bought the most expensive DSLR they had in stock (LITERALLY).He couldn't have made a better choice (sorry for the long intro - wanted you to know where my point of view comes from).  Opened it up Christmas morning and did NOT have time to read the manual before Christmas day went crazy (I knew he got it - he handed it to me, with receipt, for me to wrap it - men are romantic that way - at least it gave me a chance to take the battery out to have it ready for the morning!) so I just put it on all automatic, in hopes that the pictures would turn out well.It was a great day!  Got wonderful candids of my grandson and his parents (they dote on him and he believes he is the center of the world), and it only took explaining where \"the button\" was to my hubby's father and step-mother (both in their 80s) for them to be able to use the camera easily.  No - the pictures didn't always have only natural light, but the TTL control in the flash also helps reduce the \"this is a flash picture\" look unless things are really dark.  On automatic, it worked really well.Then I went home and read most of the manual and switched to the programmed modes.  They work pretty well, too, and once again, don't require a whole lot of attention.  The most likely settings are chosen for you, and you then pretty much just point and shoot.A caveat - I don't like how high this thing prefers to default the ISO if given a choice.  I'm going to switch to tripod a lot more and choose my own ISO - just like in the old film, you add a lot of light sensitivity and the noise (graininess) gets worse.  Your best pictures are in your lower number ISOs, and if possible, never above 400 (though 800 actually isn't bad).The kit lens, I think, might be painted as more of a villain than necessary.  The various \"photo style\" modes change sharpness, etc., and those possibilities need to be addressed too before you announce the lens itself is too soft.  I've noticed that I can sharpen images afterwards in processing and haven't gotten to the point I'm messing TOO much with the image quality in photo style yet - it's on the list for the next few days.As someone who has been away from SLR cameras and film development for more than a decade(only had a brief window of developing in my life, but loved it tremendously), I have been surprised at how much things have been coming back in the past month.  The interrelation between aperture, shutter speed and ISO came back pretty quickly, and aperture and depth of field control was almost immediate.  I believe, though, that the simplicity of the controls AND the way that you can slowly \"take over\" more of the control as your comfort level improves, is AWESOME.  It allows a user to start at the most basic level of photography - get what you want a picture of in the viewfinder and press the button - and move up from there, all the while actually preparing them to realize there are differences required to MAKE better pictures with various subjects.At this point I've started taking RAW plus JPG (and there is an immediate clarity difference between RAW and JPG before you change anything in the RAW files - wow) and am starting to work with the bundled software to try to figure out digital processing.  I found a video tutorial for the software on the internet as well as the manual which came WITH the camera in its box.If you're someone who has NEVER had an SLR camera and/or have gotten \"spoiled\" by some of the higher-end digital point and shoots, I want to give you advance warning.  The kit lens will NOT zoom far enough for you to be happy with it, especially if you like taking pictures of wildlife or sports, etc.  For hubby I already purchased a Sigma 50-200mm zoom with optical stabilization (similar to Canon's IS) for less than $150.  When he gets his camera it will be his.  I'm going to try the Canon 55-250mm and see if there is an appreciable difference (besides the range) in color saturation and clarity.  For the price, the Sigma was about the cheapest zoom lens I could find with optical stabilization (hubby and I both have shaky hands - one of those lovely things about aging).  Hubby, after taking two pictures with my T1i with its kit lens refused to let me buy him ANY DSLR unless I already had a zoom lens to go with it.  It is THAT frustrating if you're someone used to being able to zoom whenever you want to.I would recommend one of those two lenses or possibly looking for a \"walk around\" lens like one with a 28-200 or 28-300 range.  Remember, though, that zoom lenses have some trade off on optical quality, but if you're used to a digital point and shoot, you won't be disappointed by the quality, especially if you pay attention to the settings you are using.I love this camera.  Loyalty and love to my father makes me refuse to call this my favorite camera or Christmas gift ever (since both were Christmas presents and nice cameras), but if it weren't for that, I probably would call this my favorite.  It has reawakened or maybe better allowed my passion for photography and to share the art in every day.  To use this camera to its full capacity (not including lenses, filters and those choices, just to learn features and software) is going to take me at least another month or two.Remember when you choose a camera (as a lot of the more informed people in here will tell you), you are buying into a \"system.\"  If you have an existing one, it's easier to continue in that product line.  It will be exciting for us to have two alike because we can swap some things we won't use quite as often and/or get extras that can be shared (extra battery packs and the two-pack-at-a-time AC/DC charger, for one; and lenses that are more specialized).  Canon says that their newer Rebels (including T1i) have an estimated 100,000 shutter release life before the assembly fails and needs replaced.  To me that means this camera will last me two years, three on the outside (but unlikely), which is plenty of time to continue to acquire lenses, etc., and improve on what I have AND let the nicer technology get into my price range so I can afford to upgrade to something that is even better than this (who knows WHAT DSLRs will be like three years from now!).This is NOT a \"professional\" level DSLR, but what I've done with changing the various settings on the camera plus options available in the software allows me to create MUCH nicer images than I would with any point-and-shoot, and the ability to switch to lenses which work better for certain subjects as well as having absolute control over how my image is created is absolutely great.  It is a camera that allows you to move on, a little bit at a time, as you grow to understand both photography and how its functions work.I CONSIDERED offering to get a Rebel XS to save money and give him my T1i.  The biggest differences were the amount of megapixels (but 10.1 megapixels can blow up to a very LARGE image), speed of the processor (Digic III vs Digic IV), size of screen... I looked at a lot of these things and figured they didn't really matter.  I also believed that the thing that would frustrate hubby MOST from the XS was the fact the screen doesn't have the nice \"auto shut-off\" feature where it turns the screen off as you bring the camera up to your face, which keeps you from having the glare from the screen distracting you as you look through the viewfinder.  From what I read and what I know about photography, I believed I could get fairly equal images from either camera, but the T1i had a few easier features and I worried that I loved it too much to actually enjoy the XS after a month with the T1i.I ended up not pushing him into the XS because I realized that the fact there were VISIBLE differences it would seem to him that I \"sold him down\" and kept \"nicer\" for me.  That and I think that one little thing - the screen shutoff, would REALLY matter to him (and the MP count, though it is really irrelevant at those levels for the kind of photography he does).If you're interested in a good camera that has a well-respected company behind it and a large array of 3rd party accessories to keep costs competitive, I would really recommend this one.  I have been surprised at how fast I've remembered what I needed, and how the controls have felt increasingly intuitive the longer I've used them.Also - though there is an admittedly small shutter lag (more than 3fps in burst mode, by the way), it feels like an \"old-fashioned\" camera when you take pictures with it compared to the digital point-and-shoots.  You point at what you want a shot of and if you've got auto-focus on and everything was already set for where you were aiming (I do a lot of bird pictures), you usually can get your shot when you expect to.  I can't speak to seeking for autofocus, because that will be lens dependent and wouldn't be a fault of the camera itself.If it were ME I wouldn't upgrade from an XS or XSi to a T1i; there aren't enough major changes yet.  Earlier models though, or migrating from point and shoot cameras - those situations make the T1i a very good value.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "AJT", "ReviewID": "R2OP66V6VM326A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally decided to buy a DSLR after using point & shoots forever.

What made me decide to get a DSLR?  Seeing some photos my friend posted on Facebook and seeing how sharp & clear the shots were!  He has a Canon so while I was \"researching\" the different models out there the reviews for the T1i were really positive!  I had a budget in mind and wanted something easy to learn but really well equipped feature wise!  This camera really is a great deal!  You can record HD video with it which I haven't tried yet but after getting this camera I bought a 55 - 250 mm lens to accompany the standard 18 - 55 and have been snapping away on everything from my kid's soccer games to various church events to you name it...My overall evaluation?  This camera rocks!  Easy to use...takes great photos! Gives you that creative edge and makes it very simple.  If you understand aperture, shutter speed & film speed...you're far ahead of the game.  And there are so many \"tutorial\" videos on You Tube about this particular camera that I found very helpful!

It was well worth the wait, I am absolutely in love. I am an amateur photographer who started with other little point & shoots & little by little over the last 2 yrs moved up, I bought the Nikon L100 & hated it from the start, but gave it a chance, & then still hated it. Finally this weekend I bought my 1st love, & it has been amazing- ALOT of buttons & features to play with to get that perfect picture, but once you get used to the camera its a breeze. The pictures are amazing, sharp & crisp & they print amazing as well... I havent played much with the video setting as of it but working my way up there. I decided to go with the T1i instead of the T2i, bc I was told there isnt much of a difference except one or 2 features which I didnt really care for, so decided to go with this one, which is about $150 cheaper... so look into the 2 of them & compare if you really need those other features, specially as a beginner SLR user. Other than that, if you are comparing this to a Nikon, I think the Canon blows Nikon out of the water 100%.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for amateurs", "Author": "Jacqueline Geier", "ReviewID": "R3LMXJV0X0OR4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for amateurs.  I've owned mine now for 6 months and it's still working great.  This is the top of the line for Canon's entry level SLRs.  I would highly recommend this camera if you're looking at upgrading from a compact camera, or if you're thinking about going with the cheaper compact cameras.  Keep in mind that the number of MPs isn't the most important thing.  The size of the sensor is much more important.  If one camera has the same number of MPs, but its sensor is smaller, it's trying to cram the same number of pixels into a smaller area, which greatly increases the noise you'll see in your photos (especially at higher ISOs for lower light settings).One caution to users.  Do NOT buy this camera primarily for its HD video capabilities, unless you don't mind using manual focus or having the auto-focus be audible in your video.  The quality of the video is great, and the sound isn't even bad; however, using the standard lens, it's difficult to video anything without using the auto-focus.  And if you video with the auto-focus, you will hear it on your video.  I mainly use the video when I don't have my Sony Handycam handy and I really need to video something.  Also, another caution, is that HD video will eat up a lot of your available SD card space.  I have a 16GB, and any substantial amount of video time will greatly deplete how many pictures you can take.There is a brand new user interface that comes along with this camera, and I must say, I actually prefer the T1i user interface to the user interfaces on the pro cameras (i.e. 40D, 5D, etc.).  If it's been awhile since I've used the pro version, I forget how to get to certain options on the camera--but with the T1i, I can get right where I need to go without even thinking!  Also, the LCD is bigger than on the pro versions, which makes it easier to view the photos on the camera later.Outside the US this camera is sold as the 500D.  With so many up to date features and the same sensor as the 50D, I can't see why anyone would choose a 50D over this one.Unlike the pro versions, the T1i uses a SD Card instead of the compact flash.  I actually like this, because it's more portable, and you can get a lot more memory for the price compared to a compact flash.  I just have a USB reader that takes the SD Card, which means I can put the pictures onto anyone's computer (especially laptops).  This is handy if you're visiting someone and want to leave pictures on their computer so you don't have to send them a CD or DVD when you get home.  With a 16GB SD Card, you can hold a bit over 2000 highest quality (non-raw) photos.This camera is lighter than the pro versions.  This came in handy when I was backpacking through the rain forest.The grip on the camera is good for amateurs, but you get a better grip with the pro versions.DO NOT BUY THE OFF-BRAND BATTERIES!  I bought two of the off-brand batteries for this camera, and I almost broke the camera trying to get them out of the camera.  They do not fit very well.  I went out and got an extra battery, this time using the Canon brand, and had no problems getting it in and out of the camera.Bottom line, if you're looking for an SLR, but don't need anything as pricey as the pro versions, choose this one.

I also bought the Canon 18-200 mm zoom lense which truly makes the camera and all in one.  Its a little smaller than my old one and a lot lighter.

I have been an avid picture taking hobbyist for 30 years, and owner of several Canon film SLRs and nice digital P & S cameras,and finally took the plunge on a DSLR. A few issues so far have me puzzled, and may be of help to others.1. The first issue is the inaccurate \"auto white balance.\"  If you want to take an evening shot indoors with available light, and have the camera on an auto everything mode (eg, \"P\") you will get a shot with terrible orange or blue cast to it because the auto white balance is poor.  It is not that difficult to set it manually (eg to \"tungsten\" or whatever) but I find this inexcusable for a DSLR when most $100 point-n-shoot cameras do a better job with this. It also takes away the ability to grab the camera and shoot when the moment strikes. What good is great low-light focus and noise capability when it screws up the colors?2. The second issue I have found so far is that many of the pictures taken are not tack sharp when later examined.  I have tried several lenses (18-55, 50, 28-105) and many settings and with/without image stabilization, and some of the shots seem just a bit soft when enlarged on the screen.  This is a bit unsettling, and almost makes me wonder if there is a defect or is this is normal for this camera.  I even compared the same scene shot with the T1i and with my Panasonic Lumix TZ5, and the image from the Lumix is actually more pleasing.  If I zoom waaayyy in I note much less noise with the Canon, but the apparent sharpness is very close.3.  the third issue is with the exposure accuracy.  On many of the shots taken where there are highlights to the subject, the T1i seems to really blow out the highlights. I have almost have to routinely underexpose most shots by 2/3 stop.  Again, disappointing to have to fiddle with adjustments when you have a super duper DLSR and want to grab a quick shot.So, if these issues help others who are on the fence, consider carefully.

I chose this camera over the T2i because I felt that with my limited knowledge, the additional features of the T2i weren't worth the price difference.As a first camera, the T1i has been more than sufficient. At first glance, it looks and feels comfortable. The body is light in my hand or on a neck strap. The relevant adjustment dial and ISO button are easily reached and manipulated by thumb even when you can't pry your eye from the viewfinder. In action, its images have been wonderful from the beginning. From my first shots in the automatic modes, the clarity and colors were impressive. After venturing into manual, things only got better, and I found that my needs are always met with this camera. It is ideal for those who like to shoot in manual when they can, but are still a little slow to establish the best settings. If a surprise opportunity arises, the semi-manual settings allow the user to make fewer decisions with the assurance that you'll catch a lovely shot to your specifications. For instance, the TV mode allows the photographer to specify the exposure while the camera calculates the best aperture for the conditions. This ensures that you will catch the point in time when your puppy is completely airborne, and the shot will remain in focus. Or if you want to shoot a portrait where the subject is in focus while the background is blurry, you can use AV mode to set the f-stop and the camera ensures that the image is perfectly exposed. This allows for creativity without pressure.While I haven't used other DSLRs to compare to the T1i, I am happy with my purchase. This camera is incredibly user-friendly to the beginner, letting you grow at your own pace. My only complaint is that low-light images tend to be grainy at an ISO of 800-1600, even when shooting with an f/1.8 lens. While I wouldn't expect magical low-light capabilities from a camera at this price point, the issue is worth mentioning.

Larry Spisak", "ReviewID": "R2HAXV4LMXZLY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a week and I have to say I'm more than a little impressed. I bought just the body as I have several Canon lenses already. I find the camera easy to use and not uncomfortable for my type of shooting. Some have said they find the grip just a little small. I find it to be quite comfortable so far. (I played football and boxed, so my hands are somewhat stiff and a little torn up.) I like the Main Control Wheel on this camera much better than the SX10/20 series. I have an older A2E and the wheel is similar. I was very frustrated by the SX10's wheel. I've used a 35-70mm Canon lens and the 100-300mm telephoto with exceptional results. (I tried contacting Canon about 2 weeks ago about using the older EF lenses with this camera. No answer from them to-date. And yes they work perfectly.) Some people call this an introductory camera. I don't think that classification does it justice. I started many years ago with a little 35mm Pentax, moved up to a Mamiya RB67 2\u00bc format, then a Hasselblad.  I've won some awards and shot many a cover in my day. I left photography behind for many years, job, family, etc. One of the truths I've personally learned is that almost any camera can go beyond the \"beginner\" title if the person behind the viewfinder is willing to put in the time. I am NOT saying that I don't appreciate the more sophisticated elements that higher price cameras afford, just that to make really good photos doesn't always take real fancy equipment. I love really good equipment, I just think that people shouldn't think the camera is the ONLY variable. Clyde Butcher roams the Everglades with his large format cameras and stick to poke alligators on the nose so he can get his shots. Ansel Adams did not know anything about digital cameras and some would say he was a fairly good photographer and he even gave us the Zone system. And Stephen Frink shot some really incredible underwater stuff with a Nikonos underwater camera, which has never been known for its exotic  capabilities other than being able to go deep underwater. Point being, these guys learned about photography, lighting and composition. Do those things first. Remember, a camera is light gathering device. If you can see it through the viewfinder, then you can find a way to record it.And this camera makes it so easy.  I find that the automatic mode is fine for a lot of quick shooting. But if you shoot in bright sunlight, I find that with Canon lenses, it's best to set the exposure control down by 1/3rd of a stop.But this mostly a personal choice. The camera itself is absolutely wonderful. Balanced, easy to use and fast. Read the manual. I'm not kidding. Read it with the camera in front of you. Then study and shoot. Another good piece of advice I received when I was starting out was find a picture you like and try to shoot the same shot. Things look different through a viewfinder. Once you can duplicate with some degree of accuracy shots you like, you'll find your own work getting better.Sorry if you were expecting a more traditional review, but I thought something should be said about the photographer using it. As for video, I don't use it unless some guy is yelling \"Don't tase me bro!\" If you want video, get a video camera.Update: Had the camera now for over a month and I'm really very happy with it. It shoots well and fast. If you buy this or the T2, spend some time using the different metering modes so you can see which is best for each situation. Learn about lighting. It's crucial to getting good shots. If you want to see some remarkable examples of lighting technique, look at the Dutch painter, Vermeer. Look here: but ignore some of the junk people have added: [...] Once you get a feel for this camera, changing metering modes and settings is really very easy. And get the best lens you can afford.

Altho I haven't had the opportunity to use it as such yet, I want to use this camera for astrophotography.  Focusing on stars can be a trick but this camera's hi res screen at 10x should allow great focus.Qualty of the pictures is first rate.  I've read about the soft-focus complaints, banding, poor color handling etc.  I have not found any of this to be true.  When compared with the output from Nikons taken at the same time on the same trip (and in fact significantly more expensive Canons) I see the difference is primarily in the users ability - not in the camera's capability.Lens selection and quality - Canon and varous second tier manufacturers offer a great range of capability out there.  I'm sure Nikons offer about the same but for slection and bang for the buck, the Canon line is excellent.What would I like to see and don't.

It has changed my perspective on picture-taking and catapulted me into the ever expansive world of photography and I can never go back to using point-and-shoot cameras (canon sd1000 and canon sx200 were my loves...).The first cameras I have used is a Nikon D40 and Nikon D3000 from photography classes and they were great starters, but the T1i still outperforms either of them.  My first camera is a used Rebel XTi that I also love, but the color body, scratches, and just overall feel have become just too dated for me.  I had rented a Canon 50D from a local shop and while it may or may not be slightly better than the T1i, the size of the thing is too big and bulky compared. Plus, the difference in price can buy another zoom or prime lens with your T1i!Speaking of which, after playing with the 18-55 kit lets and familiarizing yourself, try out a prime lens. I highly recommend the 50mm 1.8 (~$90) or the 50mm 1.4 (~$300). You will be shocked to see what this camera can do with such lightning-fast lenses!

Sleep addict.\"", "ReviewID": "R1OOXNYTL9ZH97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon EOS Rebel T1i (or 500D) is a very nice dSLR, especially when you consider the price point. Image quality is good, and so is the build and ergonomics.The 930,000 dot screen is absolutely gorgeous. It is viewable just about everywhere, and the quality is sufficient for confirmation of focus -- something the XSi's screen simply didn't really do very well.If you liked the XSi's handling and ergonomics, the T1i feels very much the same. Having tried out a 50d in comparison, I prefer the Rebel's handling better. The only thing I wish the Rebel series had is a scroll wheel instead of simply four directional arrows. Otherwise the placement, weight, and grip are perfect for me.The quick set feature of the T1i is also quite nice -- a big improvement over the XSi. No longer does one have to root through the menus or leave the info display to change your flash exposure compensation -- just press SET, arrow around a couple times, and change the setting.The 15.1 megapixel sensor does a good job at rendering images and keeping noise low. It isn't quite as low as the XSi's 12 megapixel sensor, but that's expected. What is welcome is the addition of 3200 ISO, as well as 6400/12800 ISO (though these are really just 3200 ISO with processing applied). Shockingly, 3200 ISO isn't absolutely horrible; though anything beyond that is for emergency use only.The other major feature to be added to the Rebel series is video. Video recording is serviceable, if not mostly automatic -- aside from focusing. Focus is manual (though you can auto-focus with a button press), but aperture control is automatic (you can lock it, however), as is ISO control. There is no audio-in capability, so the microphone picks up everything the camera does, and besides that, it isn't that great of a microphone anyway. Other than that, the video capability works, although you'll need fast cards for it (class 6). Since most of my work is still photography, I haven't played with it more than just to get a very basic feel for it.PROS: Nice image quality, even with the increase in megapixels. Improved usability with the quick set feature. (If you consider the Rebel's ergonomics a pro, then the T1i will not disappoint.) Video. Decent build quality (esp. for price). Gorgeous 930k LCD. Expanded ISO range.CONS: No manual control over the aperture or ISO when recording video. No external audio input. A little more noise than the XSi. (If you consider the Rebel's ergonomics a con, then the T1i will be no different.)CONCLUSION: Try it. It's a nice camera, especially at the price. Image quality is good, and that screen is simply gorgeous. That said, hold it. Play with the controls. If you are uncomfortable with where things are, or the build of the camera, you'll probably want to go for a 50d or higher. If you've used and liked the XSi or previous versions, you'll like this camera.If you've already got an XSi, there's only a few reasons to upgrade: improved screen, quick set, and video. If none of those are all that important to you, stick with the XSi. For me, I purchased the T1i so my XSi could be my second body, so you might want to consider that.

But 720p mode still looks really good.I love the design and the button placement is very good. The only button placement i don't like is the depth of field button.The lens it comes with is awesome when it comes to shooting family photos, portraits or anything else that is close by but if something is lets say across the block from your house your not going to be able to zoom too close to it. I'm not saying this is a flaw I'm just trying to describe what you can do with the lens.The battery life for me is amazing i took about 250-300 photos of my nephew and thats when the battery went to half full.(No flash, continuous shooting)I bought a transcend SDHC 16gb memory card with it and i tested how fast it was by putting the camera on continuous shooting and it took about 75 photos before it started slowing down. To me that is way more than enough.The little booklet it comes with will more than help you when it comes to understanding what setting does what and it even gives you little charts on the recommended settings for a situation. Another thing you can also do (what i did) is turn the dial to automatic and either remember the settings it has for your through the viewfinder or write them down then switch it to the \"M\" mode and put those settings in and mess with the settings and see what happens to the photo.

We were completely new to DSLR photography, and he said it would be an excellent starting camera.  He was absolutely correct.  At first we were frustrated with the difficulty of learning what to do with all the settings, and there were times we missed the simplicity of our old point-and-shoots, but it didn't take too long before we learned how to balance our aperture values, exposure times, and ISO and started taking some great photos.We took the T1i on a trip to Europe along with a Canon SX120 IS, and the side-by-side comparison really converted us to the DSLR camp.  Even with identical settings on both cameras, we were able to take crisper pictures with more vivid colors on the T1i than the SX120. I guess the superior sensor and optics on the T1i really make a difference.  We also did a fair amount of night photography, and the ability to go to ISO 3200 (over the SX120's max of 1600) really made a noticeable difference.Our only complaint was that the auto-focus while taking videos was pretty shoddy as the camera had trouble figuring out what subject it should focus on.  It was also pretty noisy -- the sound of the lens motor came through loud and clear on our recordings.  To get around this, we just switched the lens to manual focus whenever we took videos.  This meant that we had to watch the LCD screen intently to adjust the focus when necessary, but that was better than waiting for the auto-focus to do its job poorly and noisily.Overall, the T1i has a good sensor, a myriad of useful settings, and a decent starter lens.

It's enough for me to play with, and that's all I wanted. My only complaints about the video, is that the HD records at 20fps and is very choppy. I see no reason to use it because of that. It's just not worth it. But the Standard Definition works great at 30fps and is very smooth. I've already used it to document class projects at night of video projections and (other than my neglect to white balance) it worked wonderfully. My other complaint is the audio recording. It records in mono, and since the mic is in camera, it picks up every noise and movement you make. Focusing or zooming with your lens while recording makes horrible noises, and though I'm using my much lower quality XT kit lens, I don't see it getting much better with motor movements.I understand there are microphone attachments that can do a better job, but for now, I'm satisfied just to work with the video and most pieces I create are either left silent or get a nice track of music anyway. That being noted, THIS IS NOT A VIDEO ONLY CAMERA. Much of my review is on the video quality, but it should be noted that if you're serious about working with video, get a real camcorder. I use this primarily for photos, but it's my toe in the door to see if I want or would use a real camcorder. I still use it primarily for the great photos it gives me. And as I've mentioned, it's a great upgrade from the XT and more gentle on my budget than going to a 7D. Overall, I love this camera and would highly recommend it for serious amateurs and semi-pros.Photos taken with the T1i:[...]", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera and great price", "Author": "robert ryan \"robsphotos\"", "ReviewID": "R33050HI1FP6HE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received my camera from Amazon.

Advice from friends who know more about photography than I do, coupled with good experiences with my SD850IS pushed me towards a Canon dSLR.  I decided to go with the Rebel T1i over the XSi due to the video capability and the Creative Auto mode.The video, while nice, is not something I've found myself using very much so far.  Maybe once I get more of the still features figured out, I will delve into that further.  It produces good video with sub-par audio (on-camera mic only).  The Creative Auto mode has really helped me to get some better photos than the Auto mode without fear of screwing up a setting and ruining the shot.So far, I've added a second battery, wired remote shutter release, a Canon 430 EX II speedlite, and a Canon 50mm/F1.8 lens.  In retrospect, I almost wish I would have bought it without the kit lens and upgraded to the Sigma 18-50/F2.8 EX DC Macro lens.  It is more expensive, but a faster lens and would do better in lower light.Overall, very pleased with the camera.And I couldn't be more pleased with Amazon.com.  Twenty-nine days after receiving my camera, it was being sold for significantly less due to a price drop.  I called and was informed that Amazon will not do price matches beyond two weeks time, and since the following day would be 30 since receipt of the shipment there was inadequate time to return and repurchase at the lower price without a restocking fee.  However, Amazon gave me a credit and while it didn't account for the entire pricing difference, it made me very happy that they did something for me.

The pictures look really nice and I didn't even need to edit them!  I can make large prints of my photos later because of the 15 megapixel quality.  It also takes great pictures in low light without needing a flash.  ISO 800 is the highest level that can be used without any grain (noise).One of my favorite features of this camera is the \"live view\" mode.  It is really useful when it is difficult to look through the viewfinder, for example when you are holding the camera lower than eye level or above your head.  However, the autofocus is just a tiny bit slower in live view than when you are using the viewfinder, but it is not a big deal at all.  Live View mode is also useful because you can see how your picture might turn out if you increase/decrease ISO or change the exposure or shutter speed.I also really like the movie mode on this camera.  Not too many SLR cameras have this feature, and the video quality is very good.The kit lens (18-55 mm IS) is a great standard lens!

I'd put myself in the category of \"advanced amatuer\".Much of this is similar to other reviews, but it's all true.  Reasons this camera is amazing:1) LCD screen.  This will blow you away (especially coming from an XT).2) Hi-Def Video.  Who wants an hour of video which you never go back and edit?  4 minute clips are long enough.  Focusing takes some getting used to, but the quality is unbelievable when you get it right.  Some people may gripe about this, but to me it's user-error in the end if you miss the shot, just like a picture.  I use SanDisk Extreme III SDHC 8GB cards and they work flawlessly.3) 15.1 MP.  This is nearly double the megapixels of the XT and I crop almost every picture, so this is a big adavantage.4) Picture quality:  Amazing. 'Nuff said. (Note:  I up'd the sharpness setting for Standard shots, which I'd suggest.)5) Live View.  I didn't realize how much I'd like this unitl I used it.  It's extremely helpful when setting up macros or other shots where the viewfinder isn't easily accessible.  Be sure to take advantage of the ability to digitally zoom in and \"micro-focus\", especially on macros.  It also clearly demonstrates how much IS helps.

It's my first digital SLR, so I cannot really compare it with a lot of other SLRs.  However, I would like to add that for the short time I have used a Nikon D90, I realized that the Cannon is probably easier to use for a newbie than a Nikon.  The menus and options are easily accessible and the companion Guide is fairly detailed.  The battery also lasts for more than a day, considering the number of pictures I take in a single day.  Moreover, the LCD screen is large and really sharp; although, don't rely on the LCD screen for confirming the picture quality which I will refer to shortly.  Videos in the 720P mode have comes out great (the fountains at Bellagio in Las Vegas were the lucky subjects).I mostly take landscapes when I go out on vacations, so I was really surprised to see that the pictures coming a bit soft and not too vivid in the default landscape mode: especially in afternoon light (which is very bright in SoCal where I live).  I got around it by getting a Hoya filter, but Cannon could have easily packed the sun-protecting attachment with the kit that Nikon ships with its SLRs for free.  For making landscapes a little for more sharp and vivid, I had to set my custom settings in P mode which mitigated the issue.  But on most forums, people have recommended ditching the kit lens for a better lens (which I plan to do anyway because of the kit lens's limited ability for landscapes).  On a side-by-side test with my old Kodak CX330 digital camera, the landscapes were a lot more vivid and lively at just 3x optical zoom and 3.1 MPs.  However, I have taken some close-ups and portraits, and they have come a lot better with the Cannon.  All in all, I am not trying to denigrate the kit lens, but just throwing a word of caution.  The kits lens does a decent all-round job for its cost.Another con probably is that the camera is a tad too noisy, especially when you are in a church or temple taking pics!  Probably Cannon could have also thrown in an in-built feature for assisting in taking wide-angles for easy stitching later on.  Many consumer digital cameras have this feature, so it would be a nice addition for an entry-level digital SLR.In totality, this is a wonderful all-round camera, that's easy to use, easy to navigate through menus, fairly inexpensive for the features, light, and compact.  Sharpness and vividness can be improved to give a sharper, more saturated picture quality.  The battery life is awesome and the kit lens does a decent job at that price point.

My last camera was a simple digital point and shoot.  I wanted to upgrade to a better camera but I don't really care to be an expert photographer.  So after hours of research I picked the Canon T1i.  I'll leave the technical evaluation to the more experienced folks.  My simple analysis is this camera was built to take great pictures.I have two kids, two dogs and my wife.  They are my most favorite subjects.  The problem with my old camera was it was awful in dim light, terrible with the flash on anything less than three feet and more than four feet away.  Frankly outside of perfect camera light (sunrise and sunset) it was just okay outside.  So I get the Canon and set it on completely automatic settings.  WOW!  Great pictures inside, great pictures outside, great pictures in near dark settings (with the flash) and it is so fast that I always shoot two to five pictures when I have something good in the frame(like the one with my five year old son eating a dripping ice cream cone).I also bought the camera for the \"grip and grin\" on stage award shots that go with my job (I am an association exec.).  It does a great job.  I take lots of shots (very quickly even in low light) and pick the best one.  I previously paid a \"professional\" photographer for 2008 award dinner and I wasn't impressed with the shots (plus a $550 bill for services).  This year I took my own shots and while a few were terrible, I was able to pick the best twenty, including the five \"must have\" pictures and I am thrilled. (no offense to professionals - just not everyone calling themselves that deserve the title).So I am reading the Dummy's guide to the Canon T1i and yes, I am learning how to use the settings to my advantage.

This is my first dSLR, and I am simply stunned with the extremely dramatic upgrade I received from the P80 to the T1i.For one thing, the shutter is much, much faster. With my P80, when I had it set to a shutter speed of 1/2, it felt like it took two seconds to actually take the picture. With this camera, it takes no time at all! No shutter lag that I'm aware of!I am amazed by the quality of this camera. The P80 was a 10.1 MP, and it's a major jump. I can't say how much of a major jump it is from a 12 MP camera, as this is my first dSLR, but I am very happy with the results thus far.This camera is so simple to figure out. I don't even have to read the entire manual. The only time I need to consult the manual is if I'm having trouble with something that I can't just simply experiment with.Okay, we're comparing apples to oranges here, but none of the mode settings on my P80 ever did what they were designed to do. The settings on this camera give me exactly what I want when I want it. And it's extremely accurate at guessing exposure, unlike the P80 where I found myself wandering back to close-up so I could compensate for exposure issues and what not.Today I took it out for a test run using the aperture setting to take pictures of a little chess battle I set up in my front yard. Almost every picture came out perfectly with minimal photo editing. With the P80, I might have only had two or three out of a lot that came out well. And even the ones that came out well I had to edit for noise.On to noise. No noise. No noise at all! I have it set on ISO 100 (I know the higher the ISO, the more noise), but compared to the P80 this is amazing. Even at ISO 64 the P80 had a little bit of noise. I can zoom in far as I want with the pictures on the T1i and see no noise.Some people have complained about the lens that comes with this camera. I have no complaints. I can zoom in all the way and achieve perfect sharpness. The bokeh are stunning (I'm obsessed with round bokeh). It's perfect, lightweight, fits right in my small camera bag.The only negative thing I have to report is I can't do full macro with this, but I understand that it will take a macro lens to do that.

I researched for months, comparing features and reliability records, and chose the T1i along with several lenses and other fairly (for someone on a fixed retirement income) expensive accessories. I was pleased with my purchase and enjoyed getting started, though the advanced features on this machine mean it's not a point-and-shoot kind of camera, though it can work that way in some modes. It was fun to study and learn and improve my skills. I considered the pictures to be among the best I, as an advanced amateur, had produced.A few days ago, my built-in flash would not pop up. I received an error message that instructed me to turn the camera off and on again, and I further tried re-booting, removing the battery, checking all the menu settings, etc. in an attempt to resolve the problem. I finally went online to look up Canon's product support. My link to support for this product was immediately highjacked to a web site that offered dozens of technical experts on my product for a monthly subscription fee. I do not know whether this was a Canon link or not, though I did begin my search on a Canon URL. The site would not let me back up to my Google search and gave me repeated \"Wait a minute!\" screens. I had to shut down my browser to get away from that internet trap.I tried again, and found a phone number for a product techie for my T1i. It was a short conversation. With that error, the camera body must be returned to the authorized factory repair center. With subsequent internet research I learned a few important things: First, the fixed turnaround cost for a camera out of warranty is nearly $200 -- more depending on the problem and parts, etc. Second, the problem is at least ten years old! Despite Canon's claims, this is clearly a design flaw of long-standing, and one that affects several different models of their top-ranked cameras. And third, some enterprising folks tinkered with the hot shoe, found it slightly misaligned, and corrected the problem with just five minutes' work -- not at all consistent with a $200 two-week repair job.I reminded Canon that satisfied customers will let their friends and family members who ask about their products know they are happy -- but unhappy customers will trumpet their dissatisfaction, without any prompting, in writing and verbally, to anyone within range, for years, and sometimes decades. This purchase was a big step for me, and represents a huge seller for Canon. I think the company should be held accountable for choosing to ignore this long-standing reliability problem.Update: November, 2012I bought a new laptop and visited the Canon web to download their utility software so I could process my imagery on the new computer. The software is readily available and I thought my problem was solved. When I attempted to use the software, I was instructed to insert the original DVD disc. If I'd had that, I would not have wasted time online looking for this software. I emailed tech support and received the sugary apology for my problems, and the assurance that the problem was easily solved. I simply had to buy a new DVD disc from Canon. Anyone in sales could help me.Really, Canon? I spent three grand for a camera and accessories and you want more nickels for a DVD?

I've marked \"Ease of Use\" three stars, but that's due to the learning curve of all the incredible features more than anything else.  The main thing I wanted this for was publishing pictures of food for our store website.  I wanted a great \"depth of field\" shot, with the food in focus in the foreground and everything else out of focus.  Well, put it in Av mode and voila!  And I've been addicted ever since.  Another positive is the ability to take low light (indoor and outdoor) shots due to the image stabilization lenses.  You can take a no-flash picture at 1/25 with no shaking or blur.  Impossible with a standard lens.  It comes out clear and crisp with no \"fogging\" of the image that is almost always present in low light point-and-shoot camera shots.  Finally, the price was incredible, considering there was a $200 instant credit if you bought the $200 Canon telephoto lens. I thought about getting the T2i, but with this price and feature set (I didn't see much difference between the two for my needs), it was a no-brainer.  And when considering its Nikon competitor -- the D5000 -- after boatloads of research that essentially declared the two SLRs a tie, I had asked a professional photographer friend of mine what I should get.

My primary usage is for photography, so I bought the T1i and was thoroughly pleased.  It's very user-friendly and has a multitude of quick settings for customizing your shot.  I purchased this then headed to a 3-night Paris, 3-night London vacation and was totally pleased with the responsiveness of the camera and how well my shots turned out.  Enabling/disabling some of the settings/capabilities aren't always the most intuitive (flash off, timer-exposure, etc.), but all in all this was an excellent purchase.  Digital SLR's are, by nature, larger than your pocket-sized digital cameras ... so it took some time for me to re-acclimate to having a few pounds slung around my neck and a telephoto lens in a camera bag.  But the major reason I purchased this, for instant shutter-release when I hit the button (versus waiting & waiting for a digital camera to decide when it will take the exposure) more than made up for the inconvenience.The 250mm zoom lens with image stabilization complemented my ability to shoot historic sites in Paris & London.

The camera has tons of bells and whistles on some of its sibling pro models and has preset modes to full manual. It uses all of the main and major lenses Canon puts out including their top of the line \"L\" series. The newest digic 4 processor, 15mega pixles, HD video, sharp bright 3\" lcd screen. It's comfortable to hold and isn't too heavy. I recommend getting a different neck strap (OP/TECH 1501372 Pro Loop Strap for Camera Equipment (Black))cause the one it comes with is uncomfortable and makes you sweat.The pop up flash isn't that powerful so don't rely on it. Battery life is amazing, I own 4 batteries because I purchased a grip that holds 2 at a time and the batteries last very long. I've had this camera for a year now and have had the opportunity to use it in all sorts of ways. Its held up quite well, and is very easy to adjust and capture that shot quickly. I recommend sticking with Canon lenses or Tamron as they seem to have the fastest autofocuses.The live view on this particular model for me doesn't work great. I find I have more problems focusing and getting things setup taking longer to get the shot I want rather than just using the viewfinder. This kit comes with the 18-55 lens that takes decent photos. It feels plastic-ish and barely weighs anything so don't drop it! Its not really a stupendous lens but for a beginner or to have a lens that you don't care what happens to it its perfect. It can take nice up close shots too, has image stabilization also but I recommend getting a better lens.A few things to watch out for is that I found that I needed to calibrate settings to get the sharpest photos. Example, I switched the 9 point auto focus spots to stay on the center. This seems to achieve the sharpest shots for me. I also (when shooting in jpg) upped the saturation and sharpness. When shooting raw files I fix all this in photoshop and get spectacular results.I've used the opteca and kenko extension tubes for super macro shots and they both work quite well with not too much focusing issues. I also recommend getting one of those blower bulb things because changing lenses even when being careful can let dust into the camera and then you'll have spots on our sensor. Although this has sensor cleaning (vibrates when u turn it off) It still doesn't work as good as a blower.Works flawlessly with a Mac computer and even has the capability to be remotely used with an iphone/ipod touch using OnOne apps that allow you to control the camera's functions and take photos from your iphone. The camera has to be hooked up to a computer via usb for this to work but its a neat option.If your just starting photography or want to upgrade from a previous dslr or point-and-shoot I recommend this camera. There's not a big difference between this and its newer version the T2i so if your on a budget go with the T1i.

I have 3 friends who own this exact camera and only one had a problem with his kit lens (see #3).3. The autofocus on my friends 18-55mm kit lens stopped functioning properly and he sent it into canon for free service under the included warranty. He says they were very nice and quick.4. Great starter camera. Sadly most people who buy this will never take it out of auto and do anything cool with it. Personally I prefer any type of long term exposer. My favorite light painter, known on flickr as {tcb}, owns a T1i and shows its true potential.5. Nice and easy interface with easy to learn buttons.6. Live view works well but AF is very slow in it. I always use manual focus in live view and movie mode.7. Video shoots better than most point and shoots.8. It has survived some pretty stupid situations, such as pep-rallies, following Snoop Dogg during a light drizzle in the hands of a very unexperienced photographer (I was using an $11,000 JVC camcorder... with a canon lens), hundreds of hours of being carried on my side or in my hands.9. Nice strap.Cons:1. GET SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE KIT LENS. The kit lens is great for beginners but look up people who have fixed SLR lenses to the iPhone and you will see how important having nice glass is. If you have the cash to invest purchase the body only and a nice lens, such as the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM. I sadly have not yet replaced my kit lens (I currently also own a EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 thats pretty good).2. Does not have the waterproofing of the 1D and 1Ds series. If your even reading this review chances are your not going to buy a 1D or 1Ds. They are nice. Very nice.3. Video mode leaves allot to be desired but this is one of the first HDSLRs to have video so if video is that important to you, buy a T2i or a 7D. The T2i is basically the T1i with upgraded video.4. Auto focus in video mode is useless as with 99% of HDSLRs on the market right now. Manual focus is not hard. All pro video cameras are manual focus anyways.Basically get something other than the kit lens and don't buy for video.

It's going to last a long time. I am in high school (almost finished) and I love using the camera. It's a bit big and heavy, so it's not that easy to carry around. I use it around the house mostly but I've only had it for like a month. Obviously I am going to bring it on trips and stuff. But it is heavy. Also, the kit lens is not very good but I would say if you just want the camera, don't worry about all those other lenses. Buy them later and save your money now. The kit lens is adequate. I personally LOVE the video setting and would recommend this over the Nikon D5000 which is like the comparative Nikon one. I feel like this IS more expensive though. I guess you get what you pay for. Anyways, the video is high quality and allows for unlimited shooting, which is amazing. You just need to get a lot of memory card space. Soooo pretty (the video quality). I also love the navigation of the video. Read the manual because it helps understand the camera. It's actually like professional level. Real nice, I would recommend if you're looking to invest in a good, solid camera.*Some more thingsThe ISO goes really really high which is perfect for low light. I got some BEAUTIFUL colorful pictures in the evening of my dog on the porch, and the photo looked even prettier than the porch/dog did in real life. The colors that turned out in the picture were blues, purples, pinks, and yellows, and it wasn't even that bright outside in real life. That is what a high ISO can do for you. I don't even worry about the supposed \"noise\" that happens when cameras use high ISO, because there is no noise on this.Also, I went around to test the lens and noticed that it does close-up really nicely. You can get really close and see detail, which is my favorite part of photography. Therefore, again I would say just buy the kit lens because it's good.Another thing about this camera is how it can pick up on colors that you might not have noticed in real life. For instance, once I turned on this pink lamp I have, and took a picture of something in the foreground (not the lamp), and saw that in the picture there was a pink glow from the lamp that radiated throughout the room, and a blurred pinkish, splotched sort of pattern that was interspersed with a few other colors that showed up in the background.

Have some older Nikon lenses and wanted to get the D5000. My older lenses would not fit, so had to get the D90. Looked at the prices and did a ton of homework and was really impressed with the features on the t1i, and stellar reviews did not hurt either.I found an adapter, Fotodiox and much to my surprise all my older glass worked on the Canon!! The picture compared to Nikon is a little more on the red side and photos are little brighter, SQF too close to call. Not anything bad, just a little different. Kit lens 18-55 3.5-5.6 is pretty good, but when you figure for 700-725$ and the D-90 was 950-1000$ NO BRAINER! Also just adjust settings to your liking and you'll love this camera. The real kicker was the video, I really didn't want any video, but was pleasantly surprised. The 1080 at 24fps or 25fps was not a choppy as I read about, 720 at 30fps really nice!! very, very clear and looked great. Also want to praise Amazon, No Taxes!!! Was going to buy it at Sam's Club,got 125$ in gift cards for x-mas,same price but when they rang it up the tax was like 80-90$ more. I live in Ca. The 920.000 live view screen, Wow. looks great even in bright sunlight. Comes with good software and processing in DPP if you shoot raw, works great. High J-peg looks fine too. One thing,get a CLASS 6 sdhc card. If you don't then video will probably look bad and card will fill up fast.Overall, Really, Really happy with this camera and with the Nikon glass, Best of both worlds!

I usually do not rework the pictures much beyond sorting out the bad ones and some reframing and exposure correction, simply due to a lack of time. The XTi essentially satisfied my needs though access to some advanced features was not practical or just not available. I had a happy 40,000 pictures from it and it is still fully functional, to the point I am passing it on to my father whose one was stolen from him. The picture quality of the XTi was enough for my needs.I also wanted to do stop motion which is not easy with the XTi for lack of a video feed.So I bought a new T1i two months ago. After some playing around and testing as well as about 1000 pictures in real conditions, here are my thoughts:* Access to the so called \"advanced\" features is much more intuitive than with the XTi, allowing for very easy usage of for instajnce first or second curtain sync on the flash, or complex exposure modes. I thought these were difficult to use with the XTi to the point I did not.* Exposition metering is really excellent, thanks in good part to the capability to shoot with auto ISO and a very low noise in very high ISO (3200).* The 15+ Mp sensor gives very nice picture details as long as you shoot with a boosted sharpness for the picture mode - this to correct IMHO overly soft pictures in the default settings. The results are visibly improved using my L 70/200 IS USM f4.0 which I must admit was a little overkill for the XTi.* Capability to have a video feed and to take good 780p movies (@1080p the motion does tend to be jerky). Although this is a nice side capability that can come in handy in some cases, I would not buy this camera just for the capability especially considering the price of HD camcorders these days. For me it mostly means that I can use the camera for the video feed and shoot full resolution stop motion movies.* The LCD is gorgeous - not a necessity buit a pretty nice icing on the cake.A quick note on full resolution stop motion movies: It is worth trying with just the 1080p resolution if you want to play them on a decently powered compute for full frame movies @24fps will not play well. In practice I just capture the video feed and avoid using the shutter to spare the camera, but it is nice to know you can if you want to.I am overall extremely satisfied with this camera as a main camera for what I do most; I tend to shoot a lot of pictures in kids parties and my rejection ratio has dropped significantly compared with my previous camera, using the same lens and external flash.On my particular concern with stop motion, the T1i appears not necessarily best suited for the level of quality I am aiming for: it delivers way more that what is necessary for a hobbyist and would be best suited for professional work. It delivers, mind you, but it is clearly overkill.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "M.

I find the image quality is also much improved from the Rebel, especially with landscapes.I also like having the broader ISO range it supplies.

I shot some video of my daughter ice skating. The video quality was excellent, with no skipping issues, and with a 16G memory card there is room for 40 minutes of video (in theory).

It comes with the highest resolution sensor (15.1 effective megapixels) in its class, an excellent 3.0 inch high resolution screen, extended sensitivity up to ISO 12800 and the arguably for many users most attractive new feature, a movie mode that records 1080P/20fps or 720P/30fps High Definition video footage.It combines all this with decent image quality and while its appearance might be a little plasticy and the handling can be difficult with larger hands the 500D's main problem could be that it's a little pricier than most of its direct competitors which, in these times of economic turmoil, might render it less attractive to some potential buyers.Image QualityAt base ISO the 500D produces clean and detailed output with natural colors but to make the most of the camera's 15 megapixels for big enlargements or cropping you should invest in good lenses. At least towards the edges of the frame the kit-lenses struggle to resolve all the detail in a scene.The Canon does a decent job at higher sensitivities and up to ISO 1600 produces perfectly usable output that shows good detail but also visibly more chroma noise than the Nikon D5000 (if you're willing to sacrifice some image detail you get rid of it almost entirely by setting noise reduction to 'Strong' though). ISO 3200 gets visibly softer and the two highest settings produce a very intrusive type of color noise. They should therefore be firmly reserved for emergency situations.When shooting in RAW the picture changes slightly to the negative. The 'extra quality' you can usually get out of RAW files compared to shooting in JPEG is relatively limited on the 500D. One reason for that is the quality of the camera's JPEG engine. It is doing a pretty good job at 'optimizing' the JPEG output when converting the RAW data. However, the 500D's RAW images are also slightly lagging behind some of the competition and surprisingly even the 450D in terms of high ISO noise and to a smaller degree in terms of pixel level detail. It's not going to be an issue when checking images at screen size but it's certainly visible up-close.Metering is generally reliable but, like the 450D, in bright conditions the EOS 500D has a tendency to overexpose resulting in clipping of highlights. And although the JPEG dynamic range in the highlights is slightly smaller than on the predecessor there's enough headroom in raw files to pull back highlight detail in most of those shots. It's therefore recommendable, especially in bright and contrasty conditions, to always shoot JPEG + RAW. Otherwise you'd better check your exposures carefully and apply some negative exposure compensation where necessary.HandlingWe have in the past been slightly critical about the handling of the 500D's predecessors and we're still not too keen on the camera's ergonomics. The grip is comparatively small and, especially for photographers with larger hands, the camera doesn't sit as comfortably in the hand as, for example, the Nikon D5000 or Olympus E-620. The external controls give you good access to the most frequently changed shooting parameters but we'd love to see a 50D style second control wheel. Having said that we are looking at a budget camera here and the manufacturers have to draw the line somewhere.The menu design is very intuitive and for everybody stepping up from a digital compact camera the Quick Control Screen will be a welcome alternative to changing settings via the hard buttons. All in all the EOS 500D is a camera that, after some initial adaption time, you will find easy to use. Just make sure you hold one before you buy and check if its smallish grip is suitable for you.Like most current SLRs the live view feature is, mainly due to the very slow AF, of limited use outside the studio and while the video mode delivers excellent quality footage it offers very little manual control. None of these points are deal breakers though and Canon might even, like it did in the case of the 5D Mark II, at some point offer a new firmware to allow for more manual interference.The final wordIf you currently own an EOS 450D or another fairly recent entry-level DSLR from an image quality point of view there is not necessarily a need to upgrade to the EOS 500D. However, the HD video mode, new high-resolution screen or extended ISO range make it easier to justify the expense if you're likely to use these features. For anybody buying their first DSLR the 500D is an easy recommendation but you might want to have a look at the Nikon D5000 as well. It comes with a similar feature set to the 500D ('only' 720P video though) and performs slightly better in low light.Please Visit [...]", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal Camera", "Author": "JasonB", "ReviewID": "R33SSPFUUPGQQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When buying this camera, this was the best camera for it's price, as compared to the newer Canon Rebel series.

Also (and I may just still be new to this) shooting in low light area's never seems to work very well in terms of getting the proper focus.

I have spent most of my time using the AV, TV and M modes to learn and fine tune exposure. I traveled both to Europe and South America multiple times, and I hated that my point & shoot couldn't capture the scene the way I wanted it.

However, I do know what feels right. The t1i takes great photos and makes it feel easy. Controls need some getting used to (I stumbled upon the Live View feature because it's kind of hard to find, and then had to figure out how to Auto Focus using a different button than when using the viewfinder), but other than that, the buttons are very intuitively placed. The auto focus in Live View mode is harder to use, however, as it is placed on the back of the camera and also seems slower to me than the regular autofocus. Adjusting ISO, aperture, and lens time in the Live View window is no problem, and makes using the t1i a blast.  I also really wished that Canon would follow Nikon in putting in a swivel screen so that you could get better angles, especially since the t1i relies heavily upon that one Live View screen (something to expect from future cameras).Although on the soft side, the images were very detailed at 15MP (large) and even tolerable on small size. I don't know if they'd be detailed enough for prints, but I'm sure with stitching, HDR, and all that sharpening hocus pocus in Photoshop, I expect you can get better results. The images do swell for desktop wallpapers on my 15\" Mac, but that's not saying a whole lot. They said that the t1i would have issues with noise, but I don't really notice a lot (maybe the noise is degrading the sharpness?).As for movie mode (which I plan to use just as much as the photo capabilities), it works fairly well. There is rolling shutter issues that happen with most CMOS sensors or whateva (like the d90), but it's only an issue when you're full on whipping the camera (not when turning). My biggest complaint would be the microphone, which is mono, and the lack of a mic jack, which is suckable. The mic picks up every single sound, even when adjusting focus on my Tamron lens manually. I would not use it for moviemaking or documentaries by any means, where sound is important (unless you have some other equipment that I would love to get my hands on). However, this is not so much an issue for me, as I like putting tracks over my video (music videos and such).All in all, great camera for the price ($808 when I bought it). The t1i works for all my needs and a little bit more. I still have stuff to work out (exposure bracketing), but I don't think I missed out on too many other features.P.S.

However, there are 2 cons:1. The f-stop does not go low enough. f-stop allows for making the background blurry while focused on the foreground, without having to zoom in too far. But with this camera and it's lens, you have to zoom in most or all of the way in order to do this fancy trick.2. The flash is only adequate for nearby objects.For both cons above, you can compensate by buying an external flash (expensive) and a better lens that can zoom in further.But for my uses I didn't really need to make those extra purchases, and you can still get very high-quality photos.

The nice thing is that you can see what you're composing and shooting on a nice big computer screen. This is important when you need to be sure that you're pictures are right, and RIGHT NOW! This is very valuable if you need to shoot a lot of pictures, as the pictures will be downloaded right to your hard drive as you're shooting. Also, in live mode on the camera, not only do you have a small screen to look at, but the batteries will die pretty quickly even using the battery grip because the screen being on constantly uses a lot of power. If you activate live view from the computer and not the camera, the screen on the camera stays off. HINT: if you do live view shooting, set up quick focus. Don't bother with the live view focus, it's lame.From the computer you can focus, shoot, and change all the camera settings! That ROCKS.Also included are other great software programs to download and edit RAW files. Also some simple software to post process your work, however if you're serious, you need to use the newest Photoshop or something similar that has a lot of horsepower. The Canon software plays real nice with Photoshop.Now I'll say this, to use the software it's going to take a LOT of reading and experimenting. It's all SIMPLE to learn, but learn it you must. The included software is the exact same stuff included in the high end Canon Pro models. There are very few pro features that can not be used with this camera.I can't believe you get so much quality and value for the money.The only real difference between this and the higher cost pro units are things like waterproofing, better lenses and internal components that are rated in the millions of operationss instead of the hundreds of thousands, and burlier construction.

All easy to use, with buttons and a navigation menu that is logical. No need to read through a manual to figure out how to operate in different modes, most standard functions are self explanatory.HD Video: New to the Rebel series the T1i features HD video, with liveview so you can video by just looking at the screen.  The HD video is at first difficult to find how to use, the manual explains clearly what needs to be done. The video is not perfect and does not have many features besides, but for the price and the first release of video for a DSLR it is a wonderful function to have.Kit Lens: Surprisingly the Canon lens that comes with the camera is perfect for beginning photography, and when ready a more advanced lens can be purchased. The 18-55 lens does the job for standard pictures of friends and at family gatherings. Though the aperture is not great, for the price it does the trick in low light settings.

Great Camera", "Author": "David Watts", "ReviewID": "R1AHCWG2K328LG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a Canon XTi to the T1i.Is there a radical difference in quality? Frankly, no. I've very successfully enlarged my XTi 10.1 megapixel images to 20\" x 30\" at my local Sam's Club and they are very clean (taken at 100 iso). Will the 15 megapixel enlargements to 20\" x 30\" be any better? Perhaps - but will it really be noticeable? Probably not.But, there are some real reasons to upgrade:Much better noise control. The noise at 400 iso on the T1i is probably like the noise at 200 iso on the XTi, 800 on the T1i is probably like 400 on the XTi, etc. So much better noise control is great.The additional options on the self-timer setting is nice. The T1i allows you to tell the camera to wait 10 seconds before shooting, but also to take a prescribed number of shots in a row - perhaps 2, perhaps 6, or even 10. Quite nice if you're trying to put yourself in a group picture - the camera will happily fire off 10 pictures in a row.Auto exposure compensation is a bit easier to set.The menus are easy to work with - better than the XTi.The screen is much better. Its larger size and better resolution really helps you review photos.I propose that a great photographer will get great photos out of either the XTi or the T1i - and the quality will not be particularly noticeable even when enlarged to something like 20x30. And of course a bad photographer will get bad photos out of each camera.So, upgrading is a great thing if there are some bells and whistles that make your life easier.Don't upgrade because of the difference between 10.1 mp and 15 mp. It really won't make a big difference in all likelihood.Don't upgrade just for video. The video quality is nice, but its pretty tough (at least for me) to get any video that's really good. Possible?

This review is for those who are frustrated by those perfect 5-star, happy go lucky, empty eye stare with a smile reviews that seem to go nowhere and suppress just about everything except a plethora of useless first impressions.  I've had this camera for 3 months now, and here's what I think:Images are way too soft - even with my Canon EF 28mm f/1.8 USM prime lens.  I tried increasing sharpness, but it makes images look slightly artificial, like they were sharpened by some primitive photo editing software.  You'd probably think I'm exaggerating, but no, the images are soft even with raised aperture.  I know some people don't mind, don't care or can't see when small details like blades of grass come out smeared in broad daylight (even with manual focus and a tripod with no wind and f8 or higher), but I do.  Damnit, man! I paid good money for this prosumer camera, and my friends old digital rebel (which I borrowed) beats mine on image quality.Why doesn't Canon just keep an 8MP sensor and improve pixel accuracy, instead? .  15MPs are just ridiculous, take up too much storage space and at least 40% of those pixels aren't even accurate, anyway.  You cant print 15MP on 4x6 print let alone an 8x10, and crops have too many artifacts unless you've been shooting with the flash.  Canon can you please offer us a non-consumer-zombie 8MP option?  I'll pay $500 more, seriously. It's not like glass lenses will ever produce that much detail without applying for a second mortgage to afford just one copy.But megapixels become a lesser issue when considering that the sensor seems to operate with a sort of threshold, requiring a certain amount of light to render somewhat noise free images with proper color and tonal range.  Not using the flash usually renders images slightly devoid of color, with pale facial tones and overexposed highlights, while shadows take on a tired brown or yellowish dark appearance if the threshold of lighting is not met. But this, however, is not an issue when shooting outdoors.ISO 800 and above adds a lot of random white (hot) pixels and general noise to the images, even in darker scenes.  It's really odd.  I never seen a digital camera produce so many of these bright, randomly placed dots.  Albeit, they are only noticeable when viewing images at 100% size.  Luckily, the hot pixels, though they can sometimes cover most of the image, appear in small enough amounts that a computer monitor/printer would not render unless it was cropped.Certain indoor fluorescent lighting will also drive the image sensor nuts.  If you find yourself shooting under certain compact fluorescent bulbs that have a yellow hue to them, game over man, game over.  Oh the horror of those skin tones.  There isn't a color in the spectrum that won't confuse the T1i's CMOS censor under this type of lighting.  I've had images where normal white skin tones were replaced with red, purple and even magenta, especially around the cheeks and nose.  It's just freaky.  And if the person has a tan, well then, you might as well draw a painting where at least your interpretation of colors might look more accurate. I'm just used to my old prosumer camera, and seeing this sort of thing just leaves me in despair.I rarely use the live mode for for several reasons.  For one, pressing down the shutter will not activate the autofocus during live mode. You have to press a different button in the back of the body first to get it to auto focus, then press the shutter.  The other problem is the that the pictures tend to come out shaky in live mode.  It might be the mirror which makes a loud clunky sound every time you take a picture in live mode.  All I know is that turning off live mode renders sharper pictures, tripod or no tripod.  Yes, it does offer a contrast focus option that keeps the mirror up, but it's soooo slow that it just isn't practical.The kit lens?  Never mind the kit lens, it's utterly useless if you're into getting very high quality images -- especially indoors.  The flash seems to help a little, but oh God this plasticky toy is just hopeless, and so it's in the box where it will stay until I sell this thing.  Indoor pictures with this lens are very soft and devoid of detail and natural color tones (flash or no flash), but that is expected from a kit lens.  Outdoor images that should show varying intensities of shadows come out black, while highlights are easily overblown.The camera body is well constructed and feels comfortable, but there is one minor problem.  The shutter button is way too small and hard to press if you have thick fingers.  It just looks and feels cheap to the touch.Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad.  You can get good images if you know how how to get around the T1i's weaknesses.  Why Canon keeps up with this higher and higher megapixel trend nonsense is obvious: public masses demand bigger this with more of that, and so I'll be taking the back seat on this prosumer zombie bus wishing for things like quality rather than quantity.  In vain, of course.Yes, it has oodles and oodles of options.  The 720p video feature is quite nice, though the 1080p is too jittery.  The interface is a delight to work with, and the LCD looks great.  The body is ruggedly built for a portable DSLR. It looks like it will last 15 years or more (not that I will use it for more than 2). But ultimately, it comes down to pixel accuracy for me.  And after 3 months of use, the T1i has delivered some decent images but nothing special, compared to my older cameras.  But it's certainly easier to handle day in, day out.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "5 star camera 1 star lens.", "Author": "David P. Jones \"DPJ\"", "ReviewID": "R7LQRLU5AHNO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon T1i offers everything a pro needs at a price the amateur can afford. When comparing this to its predecessor, the XSi, the differences are subtle, but worth it. Most notably 15.1 MPs is a substantial improvement in resolution, but for most casual users not that noticeable. Unless you have a habit of cropping way down, or printing your photos larger than 16x20 you will not notice a difference. Especially on your computer. What the larger format does bring with it is the Digic 4 image processor. This is a fast and accurate processor that Canon is putting in a lot of their new cameras, even some of their compact P&S; cameras. On the T1i this processor works very nicely. There is virtually no need for White Balance or Level correction and it's fast and accurate when shooting action, low light, outdoors, or indoors. The one drawback with the 15.1 MP sensor is that there is minor spacing between the individual sensor pixels within the sensor. This is unnoticeable for almost everyone except the hard core photographer who like to zoom in and see the details at 2000x and they are willing to pay the extra 2 grand for the higher end camera.The T1i also boasts a higher resolution 3 inch screen over the XSi this is very nice for looking at your images. It shows even minor focus and blur issues that previously weren't detectable until you put your images on the computer. The T1i also has a live view button on the back of the camera which is nice for Macro shots and the movie mode is seen through the live view. As a photographer I look at the movie function as a salad with your steak. It's not why you buy the meal, it's just nice.The menus and button layouts are intuitive and easy to use. The various shooting modes are nice, but the real photographers will use the A, Av, Tv, and P settings. The T1i has a setting not found on the XSi called CA, which stands for Creative Auto. This is a photo for dummies setting. It allows for setting depth of field, exposure, and white balance correction from a simplified menu. This seems nice, but unless someone explains what these setting mean it's hard to do it with purpose. I guess with some playing around an amateur could figure it out. All of these features are comparable to the Nikon D90 which is the T1i's main rival. For those who are debating between the two it's all a mater of choice. The T1i is a little smaller and lighter and the menus are different. I personally like the Canon user interface systems better and thats why I choose the T1i. Also Canon lens' run cheaper and easier to find. I recommend going to a camera store and handling both, then come back to Amazon and buy here.With all that said the T1i's higher resolution, Digic 4 processor, and increased screen resolution are the reasons to buy this camera unless you have an XSi and then you will have to way out how much you would use the new features.Now the lens offered in the kit with the T1i is flat out useless. I would not recomend buying the kit, but rather buy the body only and a more versatile lens like the Canon EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Standard Zoom Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras. It may be $450 more, but you get a much, much better, more versatile lens.I am very very pleased with this camera and would recommend it to any novice, amateur, or student (I teach photography) who wants a great camera at a fair price.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Suprising", "Author": "heyyou482", "ReviewID": "RV5LFBTIJLQVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My last camera was a Nikon D80.

Very high picture quality, fast focusing, easy to use and a handy size.  This is my first DSLR.  At low ISO, can't detect any noise.  The main reason I bought this camera is picture quality.2/20/2011:  Update.  Using this camera to shoot weddings.  It makes me look pretty good with the pictures it takes.  There seems to be a bug in Aperture Priority mode where sometimes in choses a crazy slow shutter speed - but setting it to Manual and picking your own shutter speed resolves the issue.  Buddy and I were shooting an inside wedding reception - him with a Canon 40D, Canon 580 EXII flash, Canon 24-105L F4 lens, ISO400, me with Canon T1i 28-135 IS lens, Metz 48 Flash, IS0800 and to my eye, my pictures have less noise.  The image quality is great with both cameras.  The noise difference maybe due to his style of slightly underexposing and 'turning it up' whereas my style is to slightly over expose and 'turn it down' to avoid adding noise.  We both shoot RAW.Note to Canon:  Not a fan of large mega pixel cameras - their RAW files are HUGE - which make editing them take forever unless you have an fast laptop (which costs A LOT OF MONEY).  Would love to see you make a 10-12 megapixel camera with noise control as good or better than the Canon 5D MKII.  The Canon T3 may fit this request but wish it had wireless flash control and better viewing screen (and be cheaper).12/11/2011 update:  Recently got a Canon 60D and shot several weddings with it.  Must say, like the T1i a lot better.  60D has excessive color noise in RAW file.  T1i has much less color noise in RAW file.  I am able to get Beautiful Pictures from the T1i!  T1i is better behaved with noise at high ISOs.  Though handling T1i noise does reduce resolution, the T1i still makes beautiful pictures!  Routinely deliver photographs shot at ISO-3200 to the bride who is always quite pleased with the photographs from the T1i.  Have also shot horses barrel racing at ISO-6400 and 1/400 sec F2.8 at night in a poorly lit arena and gotten Very Good, detailed results without excessive noise.  May buy another T1i even though supposely it is obsolete.02/17/2012 update:  Doing my best to wear this camera body out by taking Lots of pictures with it.  Shoot a lot at ISO-3200 with good results.

I also bought a battery grip and two after-market batteries and charger. Can't complain about the grip; it is just as well built as the Canon I can no longer use because it won't fit the newer cameras.Image quality is excellent. I shot a hand-held test: 1/30 sec at f3.5 (wide open) at ISO 800 and am very happy with the result. IS works. There is a bit of digital noise, but it is not objectionable. I plan to do additional tests with other lenses and some landscape shots. All those pixels should have a happy impact on landscape detail.I am not so impressed by Canon's raw processing software, but Adobe PS CS5 and Adobe Camera Raw 6.3 manage everything well. I like to shoot raw and these are big files. Use a fast SD card (at least a six, and better a ten). Files in PS are large when you are using either raw or fine jpeg -- 5184x3254 at 240 dpi is large file. Uses computer resources, and older systems may bog down. Something to think about if you plan to use this humdinger of a camera.I am happy so far; eight years of experience with the last Canon probably means I'll be happy with this one.Also, Samy's did what they said they would do.

But, it is exceptional and I feel like it is well worth the price. The camera is well set up to help me learn the DSLR ropes and learn how to take better, more creative pictures. The nice thing about a digital camera is you can take lots of practice photos and delete the bad ones. I've been shooting many practice photos whenever I can to try different settings and see how they affect the photos. Then, I just delete them. Eventually, I can upgrade with new lenses and other accessories if I so desire. Net, net, if you are looking to buy a very capable DSLR at a reasonable price, I can positively recommend the T1i.

This is not the best Canon camera--it is not a 7D for example. The size of blow-ups and severity of cropping will determine how many MP are needed.  Fifteen megapixels are more than enough for decent sized blow-ups. The T1i is a lot smaller and lighter than the 7D, which was important for me because I planned to take it while backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas. In deciding which camera to buy, I finally realized that now digital DSLRs are really light-capturing computers, and we should purchase the camera with some of the same expectations that we have when buying computers: we don't plan to use them for a decade, but instead expect to upgrade.  So the price (less than half that of a 7D) was a big factor. The money not spent on the body can then go into lenses.I have had no problems with the camera so far (1700 exposures). Folks having experience with Canon DSLRs (I was upgrading from the 300D) will have no trouble navigating the buttons and selections. The large screen and screen resolution are good features.  The smaller physical size is not a problem for folks with large hands (as mine are).This comes with Canon Digital Professional software.  This software allows cropping, rotating, level adjustment, white balance adjustment, etc. of the RAW files. As far as I can see, the software allows application of all of the menu choices that one might make in the camera if one were saving images as JPEG files.  I have found that I don't actually need to go to Photoshop unless I am doing \"special effects\" as long as I work with RAW files.  Also, I find that printing from the Canon software produces prints on Canon printers that very closely match what I see on my iMac screen.  The RAW format for this camera is CR2, which was not supported by my version of Adobe Photoshop.  I did upgrade my Adobe software (unanticipated additional expense), but it is possible from the Canon software to write a JPEG file (\"Convert and Save\" from the \"File\" menu) that can be handled with the older versions of Photoshop.When upgrading the camera, I decided to upgrade my photo habits by recording all photos as RAW (CR2) files.

You will take pictures that will amaze you.  I have owned and used Canon: Rebel XT, Powershot AS570 IS, EOS Elan 35mm, mechanical FTb 35mm.I have enjoyed using the Canon T1i for almost a year now and have taken some really beautiful photographs with the 15.1 MP APS-C sensor (1.6x compared to 35mm Full Frame Sensor). Good controls when using as a digital camera, you can make it very simple or complex as per your skills.  Lots of helpful features and settings that will make your life easier and your pictures even better.  Multi button pushing for movie/video mode is not so easy, but works ok with some practice. Overall very good camera.  Easy to use and I can say I learned a lot of new things about digital photography by using this camera.  T1i has made me a better photographer because I wanted to learn how to use all of the camera's features and technology to my advantage.I use the camera 95% of the time for digital photography.  So most of my 5 Star review is based on that.  But there is a video mode.  Video good at 720p and 30fps for most subjects.  1080 and 20 fps has nice quality but not good for anything that is in motion as picture skips due to frame rate.  But I must say it is really nice to have the video function on a digital camera, so much nicer to carry one camera instead of two (a video camera and a digital slr).  Digital photo quality is good with kit lens (18-55mm), but much better colors and sharper image with a good lens.  Same with built in flash, it works fine and photos look good, but pictures look so much better with a flash unit attached.  Remember to make good use of 15.1 MP sensor (this is same sensor as in 50D), so use good equipment with this body.  You will be happy with the results.One of the nicest 3 inch LCD screens for live view and photo review.  Body build quality is good, just as long as you aren't too rough on your equipment (marks or scratches show when bumped against other photo equipment).Buy this camera if it is in your budget.  If you can spend more consider T2i with the updates to camera controls and video controls.  Have fun and take a lot of pictures.

The shipping time was excellent and I was able to track it all the way to the nearest drop-off point and I knew exactly when it would get to me. It was packed very well and no problems with anything.  I was able to start taking pictures almost immediately. Since I already own the Canon PowerShot A640, S3is and the S5is, there was little that I had to read to find out where everything I needed was. I have taken over 350 photos and some videos and I still am useing the same battery and the 8gb card plus the 8gb class 6 video card. I really didn't expect that I would get that many pictures and videos on a camera with 15.1mp, but this camera is surprising me, and I'm still not done taking pictures useing the same battery and cards. It's kind of like the bunny battery commercial. The view finder is easier to use during day-light because the sun makes it impossible to see what is on the LCD screen, but you can buy a piece that fits over the screen to block out the sun and also helps keep your screen from getting scratched.  I will get that next on my list of things to get for my camera.  I just wish that Canon would have put the same swivel LCD screen as it has on my other cameras because my nose is always in the way and on the screen when useing the view finder.

I got the T1i for Christmas after researching it a bit on the web and returned it a week later after about 400 shots with it. Here's why.The good:- Handy body and light weight for a DSLR- Extremely easy to master all controls. Superbly well laid out menus and controls.- A lot of great features and controls- Great video capability for a DSLR (this actually drew my to buy the D1i)- Great price for the specs- Great software package, especially RAW converter(!), comes with the camera.The bad:- Picture quality (only checked JPEG) is utterly disappointing and for me unacceptable  > Pictures are very soft and 100% crops show it clearly missing sharpness  > The camera I had had a focusing issue. 60% of the shots were out of focus, even after I switched to spot focusing and  checked the focus in the image at the area where I focused. The focusing system in auto picks the \"wrong\" focus spots most of the time.  > Haze throughout the shots, but no function to\"warm\" the pictures.  > Missing some key image control features that would actually help to overcome the image issuesI am no novice to photography and have been an enthusiast for over 30 years. I have a full Olympus OM-2 ssytem with 15 lenses, done B&W; as well as color developing in my home lab and have four other digi cams. This camera was a disappointing experience form a manufacturer I hold in the highest esteem.After checking much more in detail and getting deeply involved in respectable itnernet forums, there is a story emerging. The Canon forums are full of similar reports with this model. there are many recommendations how to try to overcome these issues. Many photographic tests are also indicating a soft picture.I am sad to say, but after a week of research I switched camps and ordered a Nikon D90. I have been shooting for two days with the D90 now and the results are breathtakingly better. There is simply no comparison in image quality, controls and built of the two cams, but it has to be said that the Nikon D90 kit with two lenses ($1356 on amazon) costs $400 more than the Canon T1i kit  with two lenses($850). I thought for a minute about getting the Canon D7, but it is quite a bit more than the D90 and the forums are also complaining about image quality on that camera.It is a known fact that the fosuing system of Nikon is quite a bit better than the Canon system in these prosumer DSLR ranges from sub $1000 to $3000 DSLRsAll I can say .... make sure to take sample pictures before you buy the Canon T1i and ensure you like the results BEFORE you buy one.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great DSLR for the duckets", "Author": "J.

Also I would recommend getting a tripod if your planning on using a telephoto or macro lenses.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Early review but so far... this piece is stunning!", "Author": "Bay Area Cooler", "ReviewID": "R1CUQYOA33090I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first (D)SLR. And I have to qualify myself as one having NO photographic skills except to point the lens in the right direction ;) Bought Canon SX20 IS as I wanted a simple camera with nice zoom and movie mode but SX20 was a complete disaster. So, decided to upgrade to T1i based on several recommendations. Have been reading and learning about photography and playing with this camera & kit lens for about a week now. So far I have been impressed with the handling of the camera and the image quality. Images in fluorescent light are off, but at least I know that AWB is not easy. The menu sometimes is a bit of a pain - like selecting sepia tone etc - you have to hit so many buttons.Video looks good on camera but lots of jerkiness/streaks while playing on PC - due to slightly older (2 years) computer + software. Converting these MOV files to VOB does not show any problem and plays smoothly. I think it is the auto exposure compensation (not flicker noise) that causes some changes in light while panning but I am not sure.

My main complaint though as far as the images is adobe has NO RAW support. I called adobe and when they do have raw support it will only be in photoshop cs4. I did find a work around and downloaded a DNG converter, but I think I'm loosing some color information when they are converted.

I come from a Canon background, so the menu system was fairly easy to understand, and I particularly appreciated the placement of the buttons; this allowed for tactile operation while looking through the viewfinder, something that's very important when trying to capture the right moment.  I opted for the body-only package as I planned on buying my own starter lens, and I eventually decided on the Tamron AF 17-50mm F/2.8 XR Di-II LD SP ZL Aspherical (IF) Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras.  The pictures I've taken have come out great, and I am especially impressed with the performance at higher ISO settings; I can get very usable shots at ISO1600, so low light scenes are not a problem (even with a non-IS lens).  One quirk I noticed is that some advanced settings are hidden away in \"custom\" menus that are hard to find - the interface probably needs an overhaul but the most common features are fairly accessible.  Finally, I was slightly disappointed with the build quality as the plastic felt a bit cheap and fit and finish wasn't what I was typically used to with Canon.

For the past year been searching for a DSLR that matched me and this camera is it.  I have photography experience for a few years now so I do know what I am talking about.  Ive had this camera for about a week or two and already I have pulled off a number of great shots.  Its met all my needs and more. So let me break down the basic pros and cons.Pros-Revamped interface is extremely quick and easy to change settings quickly for newbiesScreen is very bright and looks amazing when compared to lower resolution screensLightweight, but also has enough weight to feel right in your handsAmazing video capture at 30fps for 720pOverall nice image quality, great color reproductionCons-Sharpness, unfortunately camera produces extremely soft pictures.  This problem is magnified by kit lensPoor low light performance, Nikon will always out perform in this areaNeed a higher quality lens to take advantage of T1i (con for new photographers)The image quality is barely past the XTI, this is due to the T1i spread of MP1080p is crap, personally I shoot in 720 anyways so not a con with meSo that is just a quick run through of the camera. To let people know I had compared the T1i vs the D90 and the D5000.  The reason I chose the T1i is b/c at the time of my purchase was half the price of the D90 and that is with the kit lens of the T1i.  If it wasnt for the my budget the D90 would have been my choice, but with the price difference i can later on purchase another nice canon lens.  Against the D5000 it outperforms overall but the D5000 is a lower amateur DSLR.  Something interesting to mention is that most everyone agrees that the T1i vs D90 is a better comparison but it seems the prices are off in my opinion.So overall this camera gets 5 stars for me.  Though even with the sharpness problems I knew at the time of purchase what the cons were and I knew what to expect.

Overall I think the Canon Rebel XSi is a very very good camera. It has more than enough megapixel as a regular digital camera. It is also very affordable and comes with its own lens.2. The screen is pretty amazing but not as clear as the T1i which has 920,000 pixel on it. But, that doesn't really matter.3. Picture taking, I think that the XSi actually take sharper and clearer images than the T1i. Probably because the T1i has more megapixel and if you use 18-55mm lens, it will actually show that the 18-55mm lens is pretty cheap when taking pictures. I also tried on the 50mm on both camera, pretty good result but XSi just a tiny little bit sharper. And when you reach ISO 1600 on the T1i, it get pretty noisy. T1i just a bit noisy than the XSi. When you reach ISO 3200, things get pretty loud and you would like one of those expensive lens that take silent pictures. Overall the T1i and XSi picture taking is almost the same. XSi if you want silent pictures and T1i if you want ISO 3200 or more.4. Liveview, I see no difference and both look the same and take the same picture quality. So no problem there.5. Digi Processor, the T1i has an upgraded processor, probably because 15 megapixel is a lot and takes time to save it into the memory card. But, the XSi may have a downgraded processor but it still save the picture at the same time as T1i. So there also no problem there.6. HD record on the T1i is pretty amazing when is on 720p. But if you 1080p I recommend getting a video recorder. dSLR aren't really meant for taking HD record and I would highly recommend that if you need to record video, I would go for a video recorder that can take true HD. Also, worst part about the HD record, the sound is pretty lousy. There is NO PLUGIN for a mic for the T1i. So not recommend if your using the HD record taking a speech.Overall I think the T1i is a pretty good camera. But there's no reason to trade in your XSi/XS for a T1i unless you really need that ISO or the HD recorder. I think the T1i should be $50 cheaper because the only thing I see in the T1i compare to the XSi/XS is the megapixel and the HD recorder. I would recommend getting the D90 if you have a bit more money to record HD. D90 not only record HD but it take pretty good pictures compare to T1i.If you want more information heres a link comparing D90 and T1i: [...](Note Change: I see that the T1i got popular and Canon decided to raise the price to $949.99? I would recommend XSi.)Resource: I own Canon Rebel XSi, Canon Rebel XS, Canon Rebel T1i, Canon 5D Mark II, and Nikon D90.(Note: I rarely use Nikon D90 probably cause I have more lens for canons.)", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work", "Author": "M love", "ReviewID": "R1C23QQYM94RZZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Less than three years old and the auto setting no longer works, and the movie setting gives an error and tells me to turn the camera off.

One of the advantages of the camera is if one uses a 600mm or less lens with a maximum aperture of f4 or less, there is no vignetting like previous ASP-C imaging devices.  The camera is suited to photographers eager to enter dSLR photography, but the T1i will be rather disappointing for videographers eager to break into dSLR HD capture; the T1i is not an affordable 7D alternative, but it could be if Canon releases a firmware update that allows for full aperture and shutter speed control and a 1080p/24fps mode. Also, if using the T1i for digital filmmaking, use a flash recorder like the Marantz PMD 661 to capture audio (which uses the same sd/sdhc cards as the T1i) as the camera does not have a mic input like other EOS dSLRs.

I'll be blunt. My old point and shoot, 6mp FujiFilm camera gave me better pictures. I spent an entire vacation using the T1i. Every possible shot from wide angle landscapes to low light portraits. Snap shots and photo shoots by the pool. Almost every shot was a bit fuzzy. I have read several reviews (professional and otherwise) about how the kit lens (18-55) is not very good, and you should get a different one. I am rating THIS KIT. The one I bought. If it's true that this combo is not very good and produces noticably bad pictures, how did this kit make it onto the market?I owned a Nikon FM 35mm for many years and then a Canon EOS 35mm for many years after that. I have no bias. I waited quite a few years to purchase a DSLR, until the price came down and quality came up.Another marketing gimick is the 1080p HD. Prominent on the box. It's what swayed me to purchase the T1i, along with my confidence that Canon would give me a very good still DSLR. The 1080p only gives you 20fps. Standard video needs to be at least 24fps to give your eye the \"video\" effect of unbroken pictures. 30fps is desired to catch even moving objects. I tested this a few times and was very disappointed in the results. They were very jerky. And it did very poorly in low-light (incandescent) situations. Not that I was going to replace my camcorder, but this feature is definitely not worth influencing you to buy this camera.From all the research I've done since noticing how badly this camera performs, I have concluded the Nikon D90 is worth paying a bit more for. Here's the rub. You should probably not buy their kit either (but I have read that the 18-105VR lens is pretty good). You will always do better, quality-wise, buying the body only and then buying a well-reviewed lens that fits the type of photos you want to take.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review for the non-newbies", "Author": "Peter J.

Then came the greatest question of all time - which one?Luckily, all options were available to me since the 7D had already shipped. My budget was $3K so, cost (to some extent) wasn't a issue. So began my journey.I looked at the following camera bodies:1. Canon 5D Mark II - Too pricey. Bulky and can't use my 10-22 EF-S UWA.2. Canon 5D - Can't use my 10-22 EF-S UWA.3. Canon 7D - Great camera w/ Video, APS-C sensor, two (count em TWO) Digic4 processor, 100% coverage pentaprism viewfinder, totally upgraded AF system, it Brand Spankin NEW!4. Canon 50D - This camera was obsolete as soon as it was introduced. No thanks.5. Canon T1i - What's with the stupid name? (Thanks Agassi, jerk.) Same sensor as 50D, Video, 920K screen, light weight, more $$ leftover for lenses.6. Nikon D700 - Too pricey, control are too difficult to learn (I'm sorry, but to me IT IS).7. Nikon D300s - Too pricey for using APS-C sensor. Might as well get the 7D.8. Nikon D5000 - Nice IQ, but no motor on body, 230K screen, swivel screen sucks.* Also, Nikon is no doubt a great camera company, but I still prefer the different lenses available through Canon.So, after two months of going back-and-forth between the 7D and T1i - I decided to pick the T1i and spend the extra $1k on the sweet new 100mm f2.8L IS macro. The more and more I think about it, more and more it becomes clear that camera's ability is pretty limited to the operator's talent & imagination. And since camera bodies don't hold their value so well, I figure I can upgrade to the 7D or 5D Mk2 in a couple of years at a fraction of the price.This is what I had for the last 3 years:Canon Rebel Xti, 18-55 kit lens, 10-22mm EF-S UWA, 50mm f1.8This is what I have now:Canon Rebel X1i, 18-55 IS kit lens (which is awesome), 10-22mm EF-S UWA, 50mm f1.8, 100mm f2.8L IS macro, 70-200mm f4L ISI can say with confidence that I'm happy with my decision. Although the 7D might of given me bragging rights, I'd much rather have an L lens.--- edit ---Okay, after a month of playing with this thing I can honestly say that the IQ is waaaaaaay too soft. I don't know if Canon is doing that to reduce the ISO noise, but even @ ISO 200 I can't get a clean shot (I'm using 50mm f1.8, 100mm f2.8L IS, 70-200mm f2.8L IS so I KNOW it's not the glass). This camera is crap, and the video feature is gimmicky at best.If you're considering this garbage, do yourself a favor and save a few hundred bucks and get the Rebel Xti(you'll get a much sharper picture) or spend a bit more and get the 50D.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Soft focus dooms the T1i", "Author": "MS Badger", "ReviewID": "R1V13Q5MVRYRC1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Being very excited to upgrade my digital camera experience, I researched this extensively and eventually settled on the Canon T1i.

Why...the picture clarity was very disappointing.I was looking for a continuation of the high quality stills in ideal conditions provided by my point and shoot while adding a lot more capability to capture action photos (kids' sports).  What i got was a fast shooting camera that gave me mediocre pictures in all conditions, even in good outside lighting conditions.  Perhaps it was the kit glass (lense) but in both auto and sports modes, the pictures had a very soft look, bordering on an autofocus error.  I compared pictures taken on my Sony point and shoot and they were MUCH crisper and clearer.Just as a reference point, a friend bought a Canon T2i and her pictures didn't look any better.  Reviews at one on-line site showed pictures of much higher clarity but they didn't use the kit lense, so I tend to think it's the kit lense.My rating reflects my disappointment at the quality-value ratio as well as the fuzzy finish.

Several elements of the T1i software suite do not work under Mac OS X 10.6 (a.k.a. \"Snow Leopard\"). Most notably, plugging the camera into a USB port fires off the Canon EOS Utility, which then promptly crashes.  I have been emailing with Canon product support for 3 months now (?!).  There is a work around (which involves not using the EOS Utility, how's that for a fix?), but, personally, if I had known about this, I wouldn't have gotten the camera.While Canon acknowledges the problem, their weasel-wording on their replies leads me to suspect that they don't intend to fix this.Mac users already know that Snow Leopard, while nominally an \"upgrade\" is in reality a collection of bug fixes for which Apple charges $30.  Unlike going from XP to Vista or Vista to W7, I presume that the vast majority of OS X 10.5 users out there have \"upgraded\" to 10.6.

I did have a dud camera with a bunch of stuck pixels or something (a red spot in every photo) but Canon was great at offering to repair it.video works great for what most of us do anyway (sound was not so good though), the sensor size is large enough to produce some clean shots given good lighting and even some usable shots in low light (I'm not a fan of high-iso photos no matter what the manufacturer says their software smoothing is doing).Who should buy this? A mom (or other person with small hands... these do tend to be women) who wants a good camera to take pictures at soccer games or family vacations but doesn't want something so expensive it becomes a target for theft. With the release of the t2i, this should drop in price and make it a really great deal. It would also be an awesome gift for a kid who is starting to be interested in photography. I would have LOVED it as a teenager.I ended up returning it rather than having it repaired by Canon, and then proceeded to drop a lot more money on the Canon 7D, which fits in my hands nicely (especially with the battery grip) and has a better low-light sensor.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS Rebel T1i", "Author": "EricD \"EricD\"", "ReviewID": "R1OHIM7LJW88IL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was in a hurry to receive camera so I selected 2-day shipping.

After a month of extensive shooting, I had to return it due to lack of quality images. Nothing was in focus, from distant landscapes to macro shots, even using the in-frame focus points (a cool feature if it had worked as advertised, hold the shutter down halfway and the points flash green where image is in focus). Flash photos were washed out and low light shooting was grainy and slow. On the plus side, the menus and button controls were well set up and convenient to use.

I have just returned the T1i.On the upside, the interface and UI performance are outstanding.  The build quality is excellent and the camera takes pictures very well.  The video capabilities are a great value-add and fun to experiment with.My experience with the photos themselves was not outstanding.  My first annoyance was the inability of just about any (Apple) software other than Canon's (bundled with the camera) to read the raw files from this camera.  Canon's software is slow and unwieldy.  It may be weeks or months until iPhoto or Aperture support the .cr2 files from the T1i.  I don't have Photoshop but have read it doesn't like the .cr2 files either.My second annoyance was with the softness of the photos.  I took about 500 shots over the weekend with two different lenses (canon 50mm and Tamron 17-50mm).  All of the photos seemed to suffer from \"softness\".  I liken it to a very subtle version of a soft focus high school yearbook photo.  This was visible in all of my photos and much more pronounced in the highest resolution .jpeg's than in the Raw files.  My camera may have been faulty but when comparing shots side by side with my 2004 vintage 300d, the 300d's images were sharper.For me, the video functionality is more of a novelty, otherwise it might have been a tough decision to give up the T1i.

I have four toddler grandchild, a dog and a daughter with a horse.  In taking pictures of the toddles it is important to be to be able to snap a number of pictures in a row quickly.  The camera allows that BUT I can only take about 5 to 10 pictures before the camera displays a BUSY message and will not allow me to take another pictures for at least 5 seconds.  I have missed many good shots of the babies because of this.  I called Canon twice and was told that this is the way the camera operates because it has so many automatic features.  When I complained the second time they told me to send the camera in for service - and this is two weeks before Christmas.  I should have used the camera more with  in the 30 days that Amazon allows returns so I could send the camera back and just use my old one.  This camera is surely not worth the money.As promised that I would update this review after I received the camera back from Canon.  The service was very speedy - less then a week turn around.  There was nothing with the camera to tell me what they had done but there was a sheet on using the camera with the flash - 20 quick shots is maximum for safety reasons.  The camera did work much better and I did not get a \"busy\" after just 4 or 5 shots inside with the flash.  I am using a fast SD Card in the camera.I spent the money for two when I bought the camera.  I used the camera at a baptism the day after it was return and it worked well but I was aware of the 20 quick shot rule.  The pictures were some what on the dark side.  I purchased the Canon 430EX II Flash and it came the day before Christmas Eve.  In reading the manual for the flash it clearly states that 20 shots is maximum for safety reasons.  I gave the camera and flash a good work out today (Christmas Eve) and am happy with the results.  Inside photos are much brighter with the 430EX.  I did take some pictures outside of one granddaughter pulling another granddaughter in the wagon being chased by the dog and got some amazing action shots.I do think that there was something wrong with the camera I got but what ever it was it seems to be fixed.

The thing that pushed me over the edge was tonight I conducted a little experiment (not scientific or controlled by any means).  I took some close up pictures of some coins laying on a counter with the T1i and also my Canon SD880is point and shoot camera.  A $900 DSLR against a $250 point and shoot.  Shouldn't be any competition, right?  Well I was very surprised.  When I viewed the pictures in \"actual size\" the pictures taken with the T1i were somewhat soft compared to the more crisp pictures taken with the SD880is.  Perhaps this is what the one reviewer was speaking of with regards to the kit lens not being of high enough quality to take advantage of the T1i's capabilities.  All I know is I'm not happy that a point and shoot is capable of producing more crisp pictures.  Regardless of what lens is on the T1i.The nice things about the T1i are obviously it's 920,000 pixel LCD screen.  It's a terrific LCD and is one of the things which sold me on the camera in the store.  That and the way it fit in my hand.  I was deciding between the Pentax K20D (same price) and the T1i and what made my decision was the way the T1i felt in my hand.  It was just more comfortable.  The focus is extremely fast and the live view works decent so long as there is enough light for the focus to operate correctly.Needless to say I'm disappointed.  I was really excited about this camera, especially since it's my first DSLR.  I think I will seriously consider the Pentax K20D again now.  It has a weather tight sealed body and lens, image stabilization built into the body, almost as many megapixels and was the camera brand of choice by the majority of the employees in the store I purchased my T1i from (all but one employee shot Pentax cameras).  My only problem with it was it is a little on the bulky side and I wonder if they won't be releasing a replacement soon since it has been out for over a year.  Other contenders are the Nikon D5000, Olympus E620 and believe it or not the Panasonic G1 which got rave reviews on DPreview for it's image quality.So that's my opinion.  By no means am I a professional photographer, only an enthusiast.  However the eyes don't lie, and I can't stand the soft pictures when viewed full size.  If it is indeed the kit lens that is holding the T1i back, perhaps people would be better off purchasing the body only T1i and then taking the money you save and put that towards the purchase of an upgraded lens.", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Took Fantastic Photos For TWO Days, then DIED", "Author": "Adam F.

(Maybe I am not using the right settings on Canon, or maybe with better optics Canon can outperform Nikon, but it's not the case with standard modes and standard kit lenses.)In all other aspects it's a great camera, with great features. Some of the features are missing on my Nikon D40x.I will play with Canon a little more, but I guess I will get rid of Canon and will stick to Nikon.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Trusted Companion", "Author": "T.

I've used an SLR extensively in the past but migrated to the digital point and shot models as my interest in serious photography waned.  Needing a better camera to augment my garden writing I decided go back to SLRs but stay with digital.  The professional models were out of my price range and I didn't need that level of complexity and functions.  The Canon T1i ended up providing me with all the options I needed for a reasonable price.  I say reasonable because it was more expensive than the Nikon D5000 which has similar features.  It's new on the market so naturally the price will go down eventually.  But I needed a camera immediately.  After having the camera only a week I took it to a week long symposium, touring countless gardens.  I expected to be able to learn the camera as I used it.  No chance.  The tours moved so fast I almost had to revert to the Sports Mode to catch all the shots I wanted.  Using only the \"auto\" modes I still got great pictures that were taken in dim light, rain, windy conditions.  It was most forgiving in dim light where I got well lit results.  The LCD viewfinder was great...gave bright, true color results.  The light weight of the camera was also important after hauling it around for 8-9 hours a day.  I have practiced with the Creative Mode (CA) some and like those in camera results.  I expect this camera to be with me for some time, and as I learn all of its features, also expect to like it even more.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Over Charge for Battery and Battery Pack", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R1DT6058BUL0RK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Camera should have come with the Battery LP-E5 and Battery Charger LC-E5 at no additional charge to the consumer.

I bought this at amazon as the seller. I was really excited to receive my camera. after the unusually long wait of delivey (amazon normally delivers 3-5 days to me upon ordering, this took more than a week... but their website says around 1-2 weeks, so this is not an issue).  Anyways, after the wait, the camera came (it came via regular fedex, No signature required!!! would you believe that??? this is a 700 dollar camera... I ordered an ipod before for 250 from a different seller also here in amazon.com and they have signature required.... what if it got lost??? and their tracking at fedex says it was already delivered...  So I received the camera and guess what? the plastic manuals are opened and ripped appart... the battery is missing, because it is already in the camera!!! the lens has a thumbmark on it!!! I returned it the same day.I will never buy from the seller amazon ever again. I will still buy from their website but from a different seller.
