{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little camera that takes VGA 30fps videos for more than 10sec!", "Author": "Laura B", "ReviewID": "REEIVGM1P15NU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 5 years with a 5MP Olympus Camedia C-50 with the underwater housing, I decided it was time to upgrade.  We only used the underwater housing to protect the camera from the elements when we went sailing.  We used it a couple of times to go snorkeling, but it wasn't worth the bulkiness of the housing.So, that being said, I went looking for another camera that was waterproof--we could take it on the boat or for the occasional swim without buying an underwater housing.  The options were limited with the Pentax and the Olympus.  I went for the Olympus because we were happy with the old camera and still have a few xd cards.  I went for the 1030sw since it is the latest and greatest.  So far I am glad with my choice.In the box:  The camera, USB cable (not the same camera connection as the old one), audio/video cable, microSD converter (put the microSD card in to fit into the xd space), Olympus Master Software, battery, and wall plug-in charger (no more cord--although the manual says in some areas a cord is still used).  No xd-card is included.I took the camera right out of the box and started playing.  I took videos of my dog and plenty of pictures of him, too.  I loved it!  It is strange to me not to have an eye viewfinder, but I am getting used to it.  It is super easy to use and I had so much fun dropping it in a bowl of water to test it out and having it work!  I've ruined a camera before because it got wet, so this was the coolest feature!I bought the camera even though I knew it only took VGA video at 30fps for 10sec, which was a disappointment, but I figured I could live with it.  Well, after registering the camera a couple of days ago, I got an email this morning saying that an update to the firmware was available that would allow longer video at 30fps!  Yea!  I upgraded the firmware (through the provided software) and tried it out and it didn't work.  Then I re-read the email--an M+ or H xd card is required.  The older (or cheaper) M xd cards don't allow for the longer videos at 30fps.  So, I ran out and bought a 2GB M+ xd card and sure enough, I can take VGA videos at 30fps for as long as the card can hold.  That does away with that negative!Let's get down to the pros and cons:Pros:*small & lightweight,*takes nice pictures,*easy to change settings (a quick click on the \"ok\" button and you can change settings,*lots of available features on the camera itself (it even has a selection that will \"guide\" you for certain things),*nice big LCDCons:*the xd card--just about every other camera out there uses an SD card and computers don't have built-in xd reading capability,*it doesn't have a remote to take group photos--the c-50 did and I loved it because I didn't have to set the timer and run into the picture--I'm going to miss that,*it is easy to get your finger in front of the lens--I will have to learn to keep my fingers off to the side.It doesn't have all the features of an SLR, but hey, it isn't an SLR!  For a point and shoot, it does enough for me.  I have the SLR for the \"big\" projects and this is for the times when I don't want something bulky and want to take pictures.  I can't wait to take it on the boat or snorkeling!I highly recommend this camera for someone looking for a sturdy camera that is waterproof (not just all weather) and easy to carry around. Go for the M+ xd card for the video capability (I went for the 2GB).  I would also recommend protective covering for the LCD (I'm thinking about the silicone cover, too).  An extra battery is always nice, too, but it doesn't seem necessary so far--I've been playing with it for 3 days running around taking videos and pictures and it still shows a full battery even though I don't think I even charged the battery all the way when I first got it because I was so excited to play with the camera.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Olympus 1030SW - I like it!", "Author": "ascNYC", "ReviewID": "R19BSXLGU2YNNT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I, after much research, purchased this camera about a week ago.  Since then I have shot about 100 pictures both indoors and out, on cloudy and sunny days.  I have also shot quite a few macro photos on both manual and automatic settings.  I have experimented with some the scene modes.  I have not tested the movie mode and have not dropped it, frozen it or submerged it yet (however I am going snorkeling in the Bahamas next month).  The build design is definitely rugged and the fit and finish is excellent.  This is the best built point and shoot I have ever handled.  The LCD is big and bright and the buttons and menus are well designed and laid out.  Flash seems consistent with other point and shoots in this category (so-so).Photo Quality:  For the most part I am pleased with the photos, especially those taken close up using all three of the macro modes.  Outdoor pictures in sunlight were sharp and clear.  Cloudy day photos lacked a little sharpness that I felt I got more of with my Canon 870 however I also think that I need to experiment with the spot metering focus mode versus the ESP metering mode.  I know my Canon had 9 point AiAf focusing which seemed to make more objects in the photo in focus.  I don't think this camera has the same type of focusing system.  I haven't really tried the face recognition feature that much but it did work when I tried it in the store prior to purchasing.  The color reproduction seems accurate to me and the photos I took outdoors on a sunny day seemed to really pop.  Indoor photos seemed overly noisy however this has been consistent with other point and shoots that I have owned (Canon S500 and 870).Value:  The price of this camera is admittedly high however it does offer features that other point and shoots in this category don't.  The crush, freeze and water resistant features are compelling.  I typically have very high expectations for items that I purchase and initially was a little disappointed with this camera.  However as I use it more and take more pictures with it I am becoming increasingly satisfied.  It's not a digital SLR and it doesn't have a lot of manual controls, viewfinder, light-up-the-night-sky flash, etc.  It is a very well built, extremely rugged and water proof (to 33ft) 10MP digital camera with a decent LCD, zoom and software that takes good point and shoot quality photos.", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Point and Shoot - Special features balance make it great", "Author": "Arthur Held", "ReviewID": "RWI1RDXH8GHA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is NOT a replacement for a good DSLR. If you aren't expecting that, you won't be disappointed by this Point and Shoot (P&S;) camera.This camera offers strong features for a \"take it anywhere\" camera - water PROOF (to 30 feet) drop proof (to 6 feet) and dust proof. After a month of dragging it everywhere, I think the claims are real. I've gotten it soaked, dropped it, and been in wind-blown dirt without any damage or crud appearing on my shots.The camera also offers numerous metering modes for shooting. The auto exposure is current with today's best P&S; technology. Once you learn the menu system, you can get a good shot almost anywhere, and the default setting works well almost anywhere.Yes, it is 10MP. No, it won't rival shots from a Canon 40D (unless you have really cheap glass on it). But you will get shots that don't fall apart into blurriness when you crop them or blow them up a bit, the colors will be good, and you'll have it with you, in your pocket, not home in the camera bag.Downsides? Sure, there are a few, and they will probably vary by personal taste. Mine include:1. There is NO finder window, you MUST use the view screen to frame your shot. It's awkward for those of us accustomed to a view finder. But I've learned... (and I'm over 50, so you probably can too ;))2. The menus are not complex, but there are a lot of options. There are settings that work for \"instant\" shots. But for more challenging situations there are great options - especially useful is the \"portrait flash\" options that let you highlight a face while not losing the background. It actually works as advertised.3. The lens is limited in aperture. This type of camera does not let you stop down to f/11 for that \"perfect\" depth of field shot. You are shooting around f/5 and changing the exposure time as you select different settings. What it sees is what you get.4. It's small. I have several great shots -- that feature my finger over the left 1/3 of the lens.5. it has the usual metering delay of P&S; - so you can't take a TRULY instant shot - but there IS a feature called SHOOT&SELECT; - which takes about 8 shots in \"motor drive\" mode - you then pick one or more that you want to keep. (you must do it NOW - before going on to the next shot, and it does take a moment for them to save.) But for action shots of kids, its fun and works well.SUMMARY: For a camera you can throw in your kayak, drop off your bike, keep in your jacket pocket, and let your kids take pictures from the monkey bars without worrying about, this is the perfect fit.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good fix for the bits I didnt like in the last generation of SW Cameras", "Author": "Petey", "ReviewID": "R1KHYHVGC03HNM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the green Olympus Stylus 1030SW after losing a 770SW that I had for 6 months. Yes, its crush proof, ice proof, heat proof, drop proof and water proof but not loss proof!It seems Olympus have fixed all the bits I did not like about the previous model. The fidgety controls and menu system are now much easier to use. The spec has been significantly upgraded with the widescreen lense (not so wide that you notice a huge different but nice all the same), 3.6x zoom and much better video capabilities as well as the ability to take 10MP shots. There is a huge array of scene modes for every possible need with a helpful multi multi-devided screen view for trying out different ISO settings.From 3 days of playing with it I really like what I see, its very rugged although i would have liked a viewfinder for those moments in the wilderness where the battery is dying or sun is shining on the LCD. The green model is much nicer in reality then it looks online (British Racing Green is the color-name in the UK FYI). It comes with a helpful MASD connector so if you have a microSD card lying about, it will fit the xD style adaptor and fit in the camera. So far it hasnt slowed the camera down at all.

Vincent", "ReviewID": "R3I2WWFRPCXIVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this a little over a week ago, just after testing my underwater housing for my Canon S30 and finding it was leaking.  We were leaving for five days of snorkeling in Cozumel and I wanted to be able to take underwater pictures.  The Stylus 1030SW really fit the bill.  Got a 2GB Olympus card and spare battery.  The card was more than enough capacity and I was really pleased with how many shots I could take on a single battery charge.  Over the 5 days I took over 800 photos and one battery usually lasted most of the day, even though I had the camera on most of the time I was in the water.  I'm sure I surface dove to 15 and 20 ft a number of times, so, the 1030 was a better solution for me than the 850 would have been.  I also really like the wider angle (effective 28mm).  Camera worked great underwater and for other vacation shots.  I usually turned the flash off underwater since shots taken with it would have lots of spots from reflection off all the little bubbles and stuff in the water, but, got some real nice fish & coral photos anyway.  It can be tough to see the LCD in real bright conditions, and, the black is just paint (one time when getting out I got trown by a wave and slammed the camera into the coral bottom scratching the paint but otherwise the camera was uneffected).  I'm very impressed with the quality of the photos this little camera is giving me, the range of adjustments, and, after a fairly short learning curve, the ability to adjust the settings pretty easily.  I also got the floating strap which does keep this heavy little beast from going to the bottom if you happen to lose hold of it.  I'm very pleased with this camera so far and looking forward to using it a lot, particularly taking it along biking, hiking, camping and other active outdoor uses.", "Date": "April 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good for watersports, not great on land.", "Author": "jennyo", "ReviewID": "R1ROLSLHUG2HFY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I spend a lot of time on and in the water and I bought this camera to stick in my pocket and go.  It is very good for that.  For general purpose use though it is poor-to-mediocre in comparison to other point and shoot digitals at this price that I looked at.  I usually shoot slide film/ SLR, but I figured for the price this camera would probably take acceptable pictures.The good: the macro mode works very well and is fun to use.  The underwater thing is as cool as it sounds.  The camera is well built and rugged and easy to carry around.  The battery life is outstanding.  All in all it should be a great outdoors person's pocket cameraThe bad.  The biggest problem (and it is a huge one) is the horrible program mode system.  The lack of an aperture or shutter priority setting is a major, major issue in light of the bizarre pre-sets on this camera.For starters, the camera sets the aperture wide open, no matter what you're actually trying to take a picture of.  I shot about 150 pictures in \"Landscape\" and \"Portrait & Landscape\" modes last week and every time the camera set the aperture to the max allowed by the zoomed lens, usually f/3.5.  Even if you point it at a fluorescent light or bright water (so there are no low-light issues) it does not stop down.  This is stupid.  It means that the only thing in focus in most of the \"landscape\" photos was a tree-branch in the foreground or some guy's hat.  There is no manual override.  Apparently it is a fixed aperture camera.  The only way is to zoom to the max which only has a max aperture of up to 5.6 or so.  Of course this means that the wide angle feature is useless for landscapes.Even if you manage to get an appropriate f-stop, the camera has a problem picking appropriate ISO and shutter speeds, especially in low light.  It seems to prioritize for low ISO, meaning that it also slows the shutter speed down, resulting in blurry and noisy photos.  A speed of 1/40s with ISO 80 is pretty useless in terms of getting good handheld pictures vs speed of 1/250 and ISO 200, for example.  Using the LED seems to fix this in the Macro mode but in other modes the camera insists on reducing shutter speed and opening up the lens inappropriately.  You can set the ISO manually but the modes are fiddly and it's easy to forget if you switch back and forth a lot.Finally my autofocus simply refuses to focus on anything more than about 70' away.  Even if I confirm spot-focus before shooting on a distant object it will be blurry in the final picture, while random closer objects are in focus.It is possible that there is something wrong with the camera I have as I can't imagine anyone designed it this way (right?).  However I went to a local camera store and tried their two display models and had the same issues.  It's going back.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera (for what it's designed for).", "Author": "W. McLaws", "ReviewID": "R1T035T27TBEV4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera mainly because I was sick and tired of accidentally breaking more fragile point and shoots. As many reviews state, this camera is a tank but (IMHO) very well designed and visually appealing. The photos are good but not great for a camera in this price range. However, the way I look at it, you are paying for the durability and underwater capabilities over picture quality.The shooting options and settings are varied and flexible and the \"scene\" and \"guide\" modes are a great addition for newbies who either don't know how or don't wish to bother with manually changing the ISO, white balance etc. Also, this camera produces nice video both in and out of the water as well.Overall I am pleased with my purchase EXCEPT for the following facts which I feel that I need to point out and which really disappoint me about Olympus:1) When taking video in VGA mode at 30fps you are limited to only 10 seconds of recording time!! Well, that is unless you purchase one of Olympus's new xD Type M+ cards. In that case you can record up to the limit of the card but there is still a catch; the new xD Type M+ cards only go up to 2gb. This limits you to only 18 minutes of record time. Plus, even though this camera accepts 8gb microSDHC cards (with the included adapter), Olympus has decided that you can only record at that setting for longer than 10 seconds on their own, proprietary card. Also, even when shooting at lesser settings, Olympus caps your videos at 29 minutes REGARDLESS of the storage capacity of the medium. On top of all this is the fact that the documentation on the camera, though \"technically\" accurate, is very misleading on this point. Nowhere in the documentation does Olympus ever state 29 minutes is the maximum recording time. If you look at page 54 of the manual, it shows a 1GB card maxing out at 29 minutes, but doesn't show the limits of a 2GB or higher card...this leaves the average consumer to think that larger cards could record longer of course.2) Another feature that is disabled unless you are using one of Olympus's proprietary cards is the panoramic function. This is disabled when using a micro SD card for storage. Why would Olympus do this? IMO both of the above situations are just Olympus's way of pressuring the consumer to buy their memory cards. Overall this wouldn't be that big of issue (well, besides the whole shadyness of the tactic) but Olympus's cards are too small and too slow when compared with the newer generation of microSDHC cards that currently can hold up to 8gb and move data at up to 6mb per second. Plus, why not allow standard SDHC cards which can hold up to 32gb and can be MUCH faster? Heck, I wouldn't necessarily mind buying and using an xD card but Olympus really needs to up their storage capacity and speed in order to compete with SDHC and MicroSDHC instead of attempting to hold the consumer hostage by means of petty, unnecessary function limits.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "1030 SW leaked in less than 5 ft of fresh water!", "Author": "D.

I live in Hawaii, so have been using it while at the beach and free diving.  For me, this is an ideal point and shoot camera.I feel that the image quality is great.  I may not have a very good eye to judge this, but my experience says that most cameras produce good images when used correctly.  Poor images are more due to the user than the camera.  I was impressed with the menu controls and how much explanation is on the camera itself (I especially like the on camera guide).

It is rather heavy, but feels very solid.  For the first time, I feel like I can take a camera anywhere with little worries.

Although, one thing you do need to keep in mind is that for the camera to stay functional, you need to follow the very simple upkeep instructions.Image quality: Absolutely amazing. I bought a 2gb xd for the camera and on 10mp normal resolution you can take about 400 photos. I set my photos at 10mp fine resolution. I really like this feature because on my older camera, I had to convert the image to high-res after it was on the computer.One thing with the image quality that you might need to watch out for: if you are shooting macro or super-macro, you'll probably want to use a tripod. You can get a decent shot without one, but a tripod makes it soo much easier.Another great thing about this camera is the battery. I wasn't sure I was going to like having a battery you had to plug into the wall to charge but its great to not have to keep buying AAs all the time. The battery keeps a charge quite a few hours of fairly heavy use (constant zooming, turning off/on, viewing images, etc.) You can find replacement batteries for fairly cheap too.

When I opened the camera up the last time I used it underwater, I noticed some water laying on the top of the battery, which I'm sure was due to the fact the I opened it upside-down. I'm assuming that the water that was being stopped by the seals has shifted from me opening the compartment. At that point, I just carefully dabbed the wetness with a dry paper towel and it was fine.

Also, DON'T EVEN TRY to take pics at a sporting event-the shutter speed and reset is so slow that I took a picture of my 5 year old son getting handed the football at the 20 yard line and it didn't reset until after he was done celebrating in the end zone.  At his Kindergarden graduation he had to walk 100 feet to the podium...I could only take one shot it was SO SLOW.  Definitely a DO NOT BUY...a terrible shame considering how cool the Shockproof, Waterproof features are.", "Date": "June 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not great....", "Author": "Gtamu \"Go Jackets\"", "ReviewID": "RJNF62XMNZCRA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera a few months ago to have a rugged camera that I could use at the beach and stick in my pocket.  I had a Canon Powershot SD600 before that had been ruined by beach spray.  Previous to that I had an Olympus Camedia D-560 Zoom in college which had been abused thoroughly and survived 5 years and mutliple countries.  I was disappointed with the Canon as it was so delicate so I decided to switch back to Olympus.To summarize...  This camera is well below average.  I have tried using it in a variety of settings and all have been subpar.  I waited to write a review after a few months, thinking I might be able to work out the kinks - but after a wonderful Thanksgiving - I felt I must mention this camera's inadequacies:1. The camera takes rather blurry pictures when it should not - it's pot luck - some turn out alright, many do not.  There is a setting that is supposed to eliminate this problem, but it does not.2. I like simple cameras that don't require me to adjust the setting for any moment.  This camera doesn't allow that so when a moment strikes -pictures often come out either overexposed, blurry, or grainy.  Ridiculous for a camera of this price.2. The movies are absolutely terrible - seriously, I could probably draw a flipbook better than the movies this thing takes.  I was amazed how absolutely horrible the movies are after my previous two cameras - one 3.2MP and the other 6.0MP.  I realize this is not a camcorder, but it's nice being able to take brief movies when the moment arises - as my old Canon was able to.Overall - I am very dissapointed with this camera.  I have not used the underwater capabilities but have let my 3 year old niece use it to see how rugged it is.  Actually that's the best thing so far - I have no worries that she'll break it and don't really care if she does.Back to Canon now.....", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Stopped working the first time it went into the water", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RB37Q11E566WJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Christmas present for my brother and he said it stopped working the first time he took it into the water.This might be a defective build but there seems to be plenty of people that had similar problems.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "D.

Slow focusing was a consistent problem.  Maybe I have been spoiled by my earlier cameras (this is my first non-Canon compact digicam), but Olympus has no excuse for making such a mediocre camera in this price range.  I know they can do better, they just don't seem to be trying.  If Olumpus is skimping on the camera to pay for making it tough and still hit the $399 MSRP price point, they should consider just putting in the effort to make it a good camera and charging $449.  I would have given a good camera a better review (I only pay for the camera once, but I use it 8,000 times).I gave it an extra star for being so immersable and droppable, which is totally cool.

It has everything I wanted: rugged, compact, waterproof, and takes great pictures.  I currently have a Panasonic Lumix TZ-5, and a the Panasonic waterproof casing for it, and never used this combo with the Olympus Stylus 1030 SW around!It was so easy to carry the Stylus 1030 SW around on the pool/beach and into the water.  It starts up almost immediately upon pressing the power button so I never missed a shot.  I loved that it was shock-proof so I didn't have to mentally treat it with kid gloves, and there are no protrusions on the camera to worry about breaking.Now the bad news.  After the first time going into the pool for about 3 feet underwater, the camera seems to be adversely affected.  I was extra careful and followed the directions regarding checking the seals for foreign objects that may cause leaks, and they were properly closed.I noticed that the videos taken (maybe from this point on, maybe always had this problem) had a smudge about the middle of the screen.  This was not dirt on the outside of the lens where I can get at and clean.  It would disappear under certain lighting conditions, but most underwater shots had it.  My guess is that it's an internal reflective defect or dirt on the optics.  Curiously, I don't notice it in my photos, just videos.In addition to this, the lens would fog up during the night after some underwater excursions.  The fog would cloud up the lens internally, so all photos and videos were foggy.  Holding the camera in my hands would warm it up, causing the fog to get cloudier.  As a work-around, I would air dry the camera each night with all its ports open, but this doesn't always work.Another major drawback of this camera that was not publicized very well is that you MUST use the type M+ XD memory card to record VGA in 30 frames/sec.  Using the included adapter my 4GB MicroSDHC card, you are limited to 10 seconds VGA 30 frames/sec videos.  You can record lower resolution or VGA with 15 frames/sec videos without the M+ XD memory card, though.Additionally, my videos would sometimes have strange regular very loud clicking sounds, about once click per second for certain stretches.  This was very disconcerting.I also noticed that the videos of bright lights indoors would sometimes have vertical glares above and below the light sources.  I never noticed this phenomenon on my TZ-5 videos.The final weird restriction that I found out only after using this camera was that it had two video modes: Underwater, and Non-underwater.  In Underwater mode, you have no audio, but can use zoom.  In Non-underwater mode, you can record audio, but cannot zoom.  Perhaps the zooming caused horrible audio noises to be recorded so the engineers decided to never record audio while allowing zooming?In conclusion, the Olympus Stylus 1030 SW was everything I was looking for on paper and would have been a wonderful all purpose point-and-shoot photo and video camera for all occasions.  Unfortunately, my particular unit seemed not be quite waterproof as advertised, and the model had some major design drawbacks in the areas of video recording.I really cannot recommend this camera based on the unit I had.Update 9/6/08The return process at Amazon.com was extremely smooth and painless.  I definitely recommend Amazon.com based on their customer service.Update 9/12/08Upon looking at my pictures taken with this camera, I noticed that they did not have the proper orientation flag set.  On my other digital cameras, my landscape and portrait shots have proper orientation flags so that programs like Picasa can auto-rotate.  Not so with this camera.  Seems like a strange omission from Olympus.", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Final Thoughts - Great camera for what it's meant to do.  Good enough outside of the water.", "Author": "B. Wong \"BW\"", "ReviewID": "R5HSDTCBCCLSE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "***Edit #2 - After using the camera a lot more, including in my pool, i've upgraded my rating to a 4 star.  The underwater capabilities of this camera are great.  Great photo quality (clearer the water, the better).  Survivability of camera is also great.  So far, 2 trips to the pool, approximately 30 min of consistent time under the water, including me jumping into the pool with the camera running - no significant issues so far.  Quality of pics are great.  Clear water provides great range.  You can see the other end of the pool from the opposite end clearly.  You will occasionally get bubbles that form on the lens and therefore, your image will contain this bubble, but, crap happens.  the bubbles did not stay on the camera and that's what's important.  I took a video of myslef jumping into the pool - no degradation in image quality nor issues with camera functionality.  Worked great.  No sound though for underwater movie mode - but it makes sense since otherwise, all you'd hear is water swooshing.  You're not buying this camera to listen to whales after all.***I've had this camera for a little over two weeks.  Bought it so that i can take underwater images when in Hawaii.  Haven't tried out the waterproof aspect yet, but can go ahead and give some insight into the quality of its normal pics.10 mp camera, but is limited to 3 mp images when shooting on some of the preset modes (scenes) - specifically candlelight images and other night-time image settings.  If you don't use the scene options, your images can be maxed at the 10 mp setting.  Night images using scene (candlelight) were pretty grainy, so i'd avoid using that setting.Normal daytime images were good.  Crisp and clear.  From power to first image - is really quick.  However, taking one image at 10 mp causes a delay before you can take the next image of ~2 seconds.  Unless you use the burst mode.  3-shot burst allows for 10 mp images, whereas the super 12 shot mode caps it again at 3 mp images.People have written that the lcd screen is easy to see in any light from any angle.  I discovered that this is not true.  Taking an image into the sun (i know this isn't recommended) while holding the camera up high (which people will use when at weddings to shoot over people's heads) leads to glare.  I had to guess what i was shooting at.  I'd say image visibility on the lcd was ~50% when doing this.Even given the above, i still like the camera a lot.  Looks nice.  Takes panoramic photos, battery lasts forever.  Used it on and off for 4 days before it finally warned me of being low.  Be careful b/c the battery indicator is deceiving.  It said full for most of the time and then jumped to warning quick on me.  Didn't even notice any intermediate indication position.I give it a 3 for now until i go and try out the underwater capability.Edit #1: Forgot to mention that the menus are pretty easy to use.  Scrolling wheel menu cycles between the different options.  One touch photo preview.  Icons are easy to understand.I've tried using the macro and super macro - works really well.  Good detail on the close images.One other con though - could not for the life of me figure out how to get the face detection to work.  I swear that it'll sometimes follow a face and sometimes it'll target a random cup. I don't yet see an option in any of the menus that allows me to force it to do face rec every shot.  Not a huge issue - but it's a spec that is being advertised, therefore i expect it to work.", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "exactly what I thought it would be", "Author": "K.

I have been an Olymus owner for countless years through several different models. I'm always taking pictures and end up buying waterproof disposable cameras far too often! Months passed and I sort of forgot about it until a friend showed me her 1030 she recently purchased.In all of my research (a ritual for me before buying anything over 100 dollars) I read several reviews that gave the camera great ratings and some that mentioned poor picture quality, difficulty finding settings for taking different types of photos, and faulty waterproof features. I was a little disheartened. Still I figured if my friend had one and loved it than maybe I should give it a try.I've had my 1030 for a little over a month and LOVE this camera! If you have used Olympus digitals before the menu and settings are pretty standard with a few new features. I find them very simple and easy to use. It even does well when just left on the auto setting.As far as picture quality goes, it can be awesome at times and sometimes a little faulted. Mostly the pictures that don't come out great are that way due to my improper use of the camera functions ( I need to take a little time to play with more of the settings), or in water situations a droplet getting on the lens (which is to be expected at times and doesn't really bother me). Being able to have a camera in water is worth a few botched shots, especially when its digital and you can see that there's a problem and fix it right away. The way I figure it, if I wanted the most fantastic and perfect pictures ever I wouldn't be looking for a durable waterproof camera. It is what it says it's going to be, end of story.In reading the manual, I came to find out that this camera cannot be guaranteed waterproof after being immersed in water for over an hour. The people who gave the reviews saying that it was in fact not waterproof all had theirs in water for much longer. One person had it in for over three hours! I find it awesome that it lasted that long! I've been dipping, dunking, splashing, and dropping mine all over the place and it is still as good as new.In short, if you are looking for a durable waterproof camera that can take quality photos of your expeditions, vacations, fun times, and memorable moments, this is the one for you!", "Date": "August 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Waterproof vs. Image Quality", "Author": "m. fung", "ReviewID": "R3AQU75MJ1B5FN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased Olympus 1030SW mainly for waterproof/freezer/drop features.

I was sold by the Olympus 1030SW because of its underwater capabilities, and it's \"crushproof\"-ness. My Canon Elf traveled around in my pocket to all the college clubs and parties, and eventually the LCD screen broke. Since that, I have been more aware of how neglectful I can be of my electronics, so I was willing to pay the $$ to have a camera that is practically indestructible. I have yet to test the underwater capabilities.I looked at the 790SW model, but was interested in greater underwater depth capability, and after checking them both out at my local retailer, I liked the feel of the 1030 - it just seemed to be more heavy duty.I have been very impressed with the pictures I've taken so far. For a point and shoot, I really like the range of options I have. The macro function performs nicely, in both low and high lighting conditions. The \"natural light\" mode is by far my favorite, I personally dislike photos that look whitewashed by a flash when it's hardly necessary to the photo. On auto the pictures look good - your average point and shoot. The shutter speed is much better than my Cannon S2, and so far the battery life has been great as well. Many of the features I haven't had a chance to use in the month I've had the camera, but if I have any issues I'll be sure to update this review!I'm giving it 4 stars because of the price. You pay a premium at this point because it was just released and for all the \"shockproof/waterproof/etc\" capabilities. If that's what you are looking for, then it's great. If you are looking for excellent quality photos, and don't care much about where the camera goes and what conditions it works in, then I'd shop around for a more affordable option.I'll update this post CR with results from the trip...", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Consider another camera", "Author": "MusicLover", "ReviewID": "R36IH1MNEPOEJM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "While I've been happy with this camera for the past 45 days, now that I'm in Hawaii and on vacation, it stopped working almost immediately.

The earlier Olympus SW series didn't meet all my requirements but the new 1030SW looked very promising, especially with the firmware update that allows for unlimited video when using the Olympus M+ xD memory card. Now that I've had it for awhile, here are my thoughts:Pros: Small, rugged, waterproof, easy to use for most simple point&shoot; shots, good pics (not as good as my DSLR shots but then it goes where the DSLR can't) & good videos w/sound.Cons: Uses proprietary battery & memory card if you want unlimited video (annoying but minor), no optical viewfinder for those rare times the LCD display washes out, battery drains quickly when transferring pics to computer (I suggest the optional DC power supply & adapter, adapter should be part of the basic camera kit but isn't).Bottom line: If your emphasis is on rugged/waterproof & small enough to take anywhere then seriously consider this camera. Pics aren't DSLR quality but then it's not made to compete w/DSLR's and the handiness, ruggedness & video capabilities more than make up for pic quality for my needs.

The problems with the Kodak, which served me well for a number of years, were: didn't zoom enough, LCD screen was awful (I always used the viewfinder), horizon that was always off, battery life was good, but to recharge you had to lug the dock with you.  Another problem was the on/off lever, which, inside my day bag, kept getting turned on by mistake and wasting battery.I looked at the Olympus because my favourite old film SLR was an Olympus manual.  This camera has a 3.6 optical zoom along with a digital zoom that takes it to 18-23X depending on your settings.  The menu is much easier to go through and I like the \"idiot proof\" sample pics on the menu to tell you exactly what each setting will mean.  There's even sample pics through the viewfinder of the different light settings.  The on/off button is a much better design than the old Kodak.  The flash on/off is very easy.  I also like  snorkeling and thought that having a camera that could serve both above and underwater would mean having to lug one less camera along with me on trips.  I also liked the fact that the recharger was much, much smaller than the Kodak.  I was pleased to discover that it will also take underwater movies. The LCD screen is large and very easily viewed in all conditions.  My first pictures taken with the camera were very pleasing.  I tried a bunch of lighting conditions and the camera did well in all.  The only drawback that I can see is that when you push the camera up to 18-23X the pictures get a bit grainy, but that happens with all other cameras that I've used and is to be somewhat expected.  The menu has such useful settings as: \"through glass\", indoor, night, candle, etc.For those who like to do top notch HD zooms, this is not the camera for you and why would you be looking at this anyway.

When snorkeling in just a couple feet of water around month 7 of ownership it died. Olympus repaired the camera, but now that it's out of its warranty period I'm hesitant to take it underwater again...Perhaps I was unlucky and got stuck with a dud, but I'm contemplating switching to the Panasonic TS1 even though it's not rated for the same depths, and isn't freezeproof. Reasons:a) the Panny supposedly has better picture/video quality,b) I've generally had good luck with Panasonic products in generalc) I'm not confident that my 1030SW could survive in 30 feet of water (I've never taken it that deep) given it failed in two feet. So I might as well go with something that is rated for less depthHaving said that, it sounds like the fine print on the Panny TS1 has all sorts of disclaimers about the shock and waterproof guarantee.As for the Canon D10, it doesn't match up with the Panny in PQ and, as Gizmodo put it, \"The D10 looks like it was designed by Ringo on the set of Yellow Submarine--its bulbous shell and porthole-like screws drive home the fact that this baby is going underwater.

Overall, I'm happy with the Olympus, but it falls short of my SD700 in a few areas.Pros:- The Olympus is smaller than I expected.  It fits easily into my pocket and is not cumbersome to carry around on backpacking trips, for example.- This thing is durable.  You can feel the \"sturdiness.\"  I added a screen protector from bestskinsever, and now I feel like it's indestructible.  I never worry about it.- It does a great job with macros (close-ups).  It even has a special macro mode that uses a small, built-in LED to light your subject.  Very nice feature.- It has an impressive zoom; better than the 3X of my old SD700.- It has an impressively high-res CCD: 10.1MP; again, better than my old SD700.Cons:- My old SD700 still took better pictures.  I can't think of a way to quantify this qualitative observation, but I think it's true.  I recently went on a backpacking trip and my buddy brought his camera, which happened to be an SD700.  We took pictures of the same scenery, but the Fall colors looked more vibrant through his camera.  Images also seem...\"sharper\" with the SD700, despite the megapixel advantage of the Olympus.  Maybe someone who knows more about cameras could explain this.- There are a handful of different acquisition settings on the Olympus, but navigating to them is not very intuitive and definitely not very fast.- There's no real manual control of things like shutter speed, etc.I use this camera for all of my outdoor activities: backpacking, snowboarding, climbing, and trips to the beach.  That's what this thing was made for, and it feels good to carry it around in my pocket or toss it into my gear bag without worrying about it breaking like my other cameras.  The pictures it takes are good enough for me, but are out-shined even by older, cheaper cameras of the same size.  If you get this camera, you'll like it.

From that experience I didn't want to repeat what everyone else has already said, I just wanted to share my story so far.The back story:I purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS5.  It was a nice little point and shoot camera, but after carrying it around in my pocket one day, lint got behind the lens.  Having had a couple point and shoot cameras in my time, I didn't even realize this was possible, it's never happened before.  I've only had it a few months and short of completely disassembling the camera, there's nothing I can do about it.  The pictures are so bad now it's not worth taking any.  Frustrating!Flash forward to a couple weeks ago:I took the kids to an indoor water park and didn't even bother bringing the lint damaged camera.  After a couple hours of fun, I noticed the park had digital waterproof cameras for rent so I tried it.  It was the Olympus 7.1 megapixel camera.  It was great, I could take it down the slides, take underwater shots of the kids in the pool and carry it around without having to worry about anything.  The shots were good, not outstanding, but good considering what I was putting it though.So that got me to thinking, I didn't really need a waterproof camera, but if I had one, I wouldn't have to worry about LINT!So as to not get burned again, I went out and did a little looking around.  There really wasn't much else out there.  So I got this 10 megapixel version in hopes of a slightly better picture, after all, 7.1 was good, 10 must be great! Right?  Anyway, when I went to order, this is when I got schooled on memory cards.  From what I found, Olympus and Fuji only use XD cards, which are slower and more expensive.  Not to mention, the biggest card I could find was 2 gigs.  I'm sure that will be fine for the most part...and if not, I could get another... but I already had gigs of SD and MicroSD cards, so I wasn't real happy I couldn't use those.So my camera shows up today, I open the box and right on top is an Olympus XD adapter for MicoSD cards!

When we got back home, I sent the first camera in to Olympus for repair, and received it back a week or so later. After that, both cameras worked fine- above water. Fast forward to two years later and here we were just few weeks ago in Greece for our anniversary. We took one of the cameras with us (the newer one, purchased in Hawaii), and of course used it underwater.  A few days into our vacation, the frame around the lens fell off, the paint completely peeled off, and the camera stopped working. It was a nightmarish flashback of our honeymoon experience. We hadn't exceeded 10 feet underwater, and we always took care of our cameras according to the instructions that came with. Here we were on another vacation stuck without a camera. Olympus had let us down two times too many. We bought a cheap underwater camera for 60 euros and vowed to never again purchase another Olympus underwater camera. This is a great camera when it decides to work, but I would advise anyone against taking the chance of buying it. It will eventually break down.

I've had this camera for only 13 months from when purchased brand new. Before going into the water I took a few pictures and it was working as expected, then I got to swimming and then took the camera out for my snorkeling partner to take a picture. The LCD never turned on and the little amber LED next to the dial was blinking trying to tell me something as well as the camera giving it's audible funeral tones.

I took it out of the water immediately but after my resuscitation attempts and letting it dry with it's guts to the sun, it was clear that Olympus had ran away with my money. I must say that I never trusted the battery door latch and sealing molding on this camera and it finally failed to keep the water out. The paint on the face of the camera has started to peel off and the metal square around the lense has shifted; signs of its flawed design since I have never even dropped the camera, plus it has always been handled like a stick of dynamite while in my ownership. I found the picture quality average at best, but it worked, so no complaints there. The thing that this camera had going with me was that it was \"water-proof\".

I am dissatisfied with the Olympus Stylus 1030 SW and do NOT recommend it to anyone willing to listen. Olympus should go back to the drawing board with this camera and fix its shortcomings, ie. the water leak problem through the battery door due to a flimsy sealing rubber molding, the paint peeling off problem and lense frame that just comes loose, which happened to me or just falls off the camera, which people have documented.

With its SW line, Olympus has marketed itself as the manufacturer of the most robust point and shoot cameras.  In my experience, however, this camera is no more robust than those made by competitors (most notably Pentax, but others including Canon have now also entered this niche).  And it has a lot of annoyances to keep me from recommending it:Pros:1. Fast - very little shutter lag. Allows reasonably sharp action photos, especially in sport mode.2. Decent battery time3. Fairly rugged lcd4. Self-retracting lens cover protects underlying glass5. Adequate picture quality6. Fair video quality for a point and shoot (though see reservations below).Cons:1. Contrasty images with blown highlights in full sun2. Need to go through the special shooting mode menu every time you turn the camera on somewhat negates the speed advantage of sport mode - a significant consideration for a camera that is intended to be used for fun and sun3. Proprietary memory card (xD made by Olympus) limited to 2gb, meaning less capacity.  Competing cameras use SD card which are less expensive, enjoy use in a wide variety of electronic devices, and available  up to 32gb.  (xD cards from other companies - if you can find them - won't support full length video, nor will the even more awkward microSD card, which requires an adapter).  Furthermore, all but a few card readers on the market don't work with xD cards, so you'll have to keep your camera cable handy to download.  The lower capacity of xD means more frequent downloads (especially if you shoot videos very often, and because most card readers won't recognize xD cards you will need to keep you camera cable handy.  And if your camera fails with pictures left on the card you'll have to buy a compatible card reader to ever see them.3. Batteries of previous Oly SW cameras won't work in this one, if you're thinking of upgrading.4. Not that robust: leaked the very first (and only) time I snorkeled with it in salt water, though I was not close to its depth limit.  Oly did repair it under warranty, but the process was by no means seamless. (With the camera was a sheet that stated there was a depth meter - barometer - built into the camera confirming that warranty terms had not been violated, something I don't recall seeing in the manual).  The camera does not, in my experience, live up to its specifications and is not more shockproof or waterproof than competing models from other manufacturers.  Consider an extended warranty.5. The tiny icons on the mode selection wheel - there are 8 of them - wear off with use.  Mine are no longer legible, and the warranty repair did not address this.6. Unfortunate lens placement in the upper right hand corner of the camera body. Even after taking a couple thousand pictures with this camera, I still occasionally catch a part of one of the fingers of my steadying left hand in the image.  Overall ergonomics of this camera rate a C+ making it hard to shoot with one hand (in my case this is important as I am frequently holding a kayak paddle in the other).  My favorite in this regard was Sony's DSC U-60, long since discontinued.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Super durable camera, OK pictures, new firmware addresses movie length issues", "Author": "Robert Petkus", "ReviewID": "R1V6OE6CZB68V1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Most reviewers purchased this product for the same reasons and have had the same experiences.  They want an abuse-proof and/or waterproof camera (probably have kids, too) and, yes, the pictures are good but not as good as their old Canon that was crushed or dropped.Same for me. I had (2) Canons, one dropped with the lens extended, the other forgotten in my bathing suit mesh pocket.  My 8 mega-pixel Canon SD870-IS took consistently clearer, richer photos than this one.  By a wide margin? No, but it's noticeable when browsing my photo library.Where this camera excels is in its durability and I suspect most folks requiring this functionality will end up purchasing something in the Stylus SW line.  Ironically, it hasn't been dropped yet, but it's gotten dirty, wet, and dusty.  I no longer have to obsess about seeing or imagining motes of dust in the lens.  This camera is air-tight and I like that the lens is fixed.  Best part is that the directions tell you to clean the camera under running water.  Nice.I went in the pool with this camera for 20 minutes and followed the included wet-care instructions and didn't encounter the problems claimed by other reviewers.  That doesn't mean they're not true -- maybe the camera was defective or the environment subjected to the camera was more severe.As for camera performance, well it's OK.  I'm not going to go into technical details but 1) I experience a lot of white, bleached faces with the auto setting and 2) occasional inconsistent flash leading to image blurring.  Image stabilization for low-light photography is ho-hum and certainly inferior to the beloved Canon.Some elements that are top-notch for a point&shoot; though (and exceed my Canon):- Camera takes wonderful panoramic photos with auto-stitching on the fly.  A dummy could use it and get seamless images.- High-speed photos in manual-mode look great- A plethora of useful presets such as available light, candlelight, and cuisine- Macro mode takes stunning pics with LED flash optionsNow to movie mode which is now quite decent. There used to be *so* many caveats with movie length and what memory cards are compatible with what movie mode that aren't worth mentioning.  Suffice it to say that there have been major improvements in the latest firmware version 1.1.  Read on:- With an Olympus xD TypeM+ or TypeH card you can record movies (640x480, 30fps) up to the full capacity of the card (max xD card size is still 2GB I think). However, a single movie can't exceed 29 minutes.- Lameness still exists when using micro SDHC or non M+/H xD cards.  640x480, 30fps is still limited to 10 seconds (??).  However, 4GB+ mSDHC cards are now supported for movie-mode full card capacity *although* only in 320x240.  Single movie length is likewise limited to 29 minutes.Bottom line: download and install the firmware from the Olympus site.Last but not least, (2) final things:1) Regular usb cables aren't compatible with Olympus devices so add another cable to detangle from the spaghetti.2) Why, oh why is Olympus still using xD memory cards? The fact that these cameras support micro SDHC cards with an adapter is just a sign that xD has limited time on this planet.  They're trailing in capacity, more expensive, and larger.  I made sure I ordered an 8GB microSDHC SanDisk card with this camera.  I only use the 2GB xD M+ when I know I'm going to be recording a movie and don't feel like bringing a camcorder (note to self: buy a Flip HD).In summary:- 5 stars, Durability- 3 stars, General, auto-mode photo quality vs. Canon- 4 stars, Camera functionality- 3 stars, Movie functionality- This camera looks great - sexy comes to mind but I didn't say it.  Canon has the waterproof, shock-resistant D10 but it looks bubbly, like a Fisher Price kid camera.- For features/price this camera wins over the Olympus Stylus Tough 8000.

This camera really fit the bill and I was able to take some really great action pictures while participating in the action. I actually enjoyed carrying the camera and snapping all the great pictures.I just have a couple of suggestions that could be made to improve upon the the camera. First, add a view-finder to the camera. The view screen becomes useless under bright sunlight. The addition of the view-finder would help on these occasions. The second is to, of course, improve upon the view screen when in bright sunlight. On these occassions I was able to take the picture by aiming the camera in the general direction.

I also own the newer (at the time) 1030 and have five of them now (mine, my back-up, 1 for each of two daughters). That's four .....Unfortunately, every one of these cameras has flooded either snorkeling at 5 feet max, or while in my swim suit while wading chest deep. And every one had to go back to Oly for a repair, which they did no problem (other than the logistics of shipping from outside the USA.Yes, I bought extended warranties on all of these cameras but they all flooded well within the original 1 year warranty period ! Olympus denies any issue with these cameras, but do a google search for OLYMPUS STYLUS FLOODING and you will see I am not alone. Several major USA camera repair centers DO acknowledge they get a lot of these cameras back for flooding damage. I called and spoke at great length with Oly in NY and they promised to get back to me with a response. That was in September and am still waiting!DISCLOSURE : I was a professional photog for 30+ years and I know how to care for the camera. Despite careful cleaning of the seals, and assuring they were closed prior to wading, they still flooded.In August I got one of the 1030's back from Olympus, went wading, and it flooded again ! So back it went. That's when I bought camera # 5 last week. It is on its way back to Oly as I type this!So why did I buy another one ????? Because it is otherwise a great camera, especially for macro shots. (Though the flash is useless beyond 6 feet or so.) But mainly because I own several of the Olympus PT-043 underwater housings and no other camera will fit inside. Both of these models I bought are supposed to go 33 feet (10 metres) without the need for a housing.MORAL : Use the camera ONLY IN A HOUSING if you plan on getting it wet !

I wasn't trying to compare anything but just copied all our photos into one folder and boy was I surprised.ALL & EVERY picture that was taken by my $300 something camera was noisy and not focused well, while pictures taken by canon were way better.

I'd hang it on my arm & it would get dunked every now & then for a few minutes, but it was never used to take pictures underwater since the water wasn't clear enough.Unfortunately, the first time we did take pictures underwater while snorkeling in the Caribbean, the LCD died a few hours later.

The camera still takes pics, the little light blinks & we see the pics on the memory card, however, because there's no viewfinder, can't really take pictures anymore.

Right now finding one and getting it is a struggle and you'll pay about $100 or more for it than the readily available 8010, and why is that???, because the 8010 well...is a poor purchase by comparison. I bought two of the 8010's hoping I just had a bad one the first go round, but alas...it was just a bad camera.I had my original 1030 stolen and replacing it has been a nightmare. After several sites saying they had one and me placing an order, I got the email...well we don't have this in stock but we'll sell you something else.

I have a screen protector because I'm paranoid about that part of the camera (it ain't scratch proof). I dropped it in a wishing fountain and it's fine. Most of the time I put it in jean and just go through the day with it in my pockets. My real carabiner with my keys would tap my jean's pocket with the camera on it and it still work. Took it to... New Port Beach, I believe, and it was fine -- made sure the sands didn't go into the lens but other then that it was fine.Picture Quality:This is my first digital camera and I'm not a professional photographer or anything, so I can't say much about picture quality. It's decent but you can't take like a picture of a wood pecker from 7 feet away with max zoom and whatever (I've tried it). I found it annoying when I was trying to take pictures of the aphids, green little bugs, that was on top of my black car, couldn't focus. If you zoom in it can't focus and if you zoom out you can't take a picture of the insects because they're a bit small. So those are the two things I've noticed maybe there are options to fix that, if there are any I haven't found it. So overall, my impression of picture quality is decent and maybe a bit below that.Main reason I wanted one because I wanted to take picture of my adventures but it have to handle my daily life and it does that spectacularly.

I purchased it in the black color and also bought a protective silicone shell, which I would purchase over any leather or neoprene camera case (http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Tough-8000-Protective-Silicone-Digital/dp/B001TKTDP8/ref=pd_sim_p_67) to provide additional protection for the camera against scratches and falls and to keep all compartments securely closed underwater preventing accidentally opening the camera. I have used it on numerous family vacations, which include taking it snorkeling, to the pool, beachside, on a boat, in the snow, and at the bar (dumped beers, wet bars, my friends' slippery hands), etc. It takes fantastic pictures for a point and shoot camera. I really love the wide-angle lens, which allows me to take a picture of 5 people and me without missing a face and holding the camera at arm's-length. I would definitely recommend using the xD card, because I love taking panoramic photos, there are 3 panoramic settings for the camera with two options that \"stitch\" the three pictures in-camera and one where you manually \"stitch\" the pictures together on your computer after you upload them. The panoramic feature cannot be utilized without the use of an xD card.My only complaint is that with the black camera after snorkeling for 1/2 a day in the Caribbean, the salt water rubbed away part of the black on the front of the camera. It looks like paint chipping off the camera, but it is a completely superficial flaw with no impact on the camera's features or capabilities. Also, after a day-long hiking trip in the Yucatan and cave swimming and rappelling, I noticed that the plastic lens cover (the small plastic square frame on top of the lens, not the retractable lens cover) had fallen off.

Olympus does not seem to think that end users should be allowed to change the seals and they do not indicate any method to use any sort of lubricant/sealer to improve the seal. With this in mind, the camera will leak at some point and it will likely cost more than a new camera to repair it.

This camera was purchased for a family trip to Maui and I was very excited about using it for snorkeling. The camera (black olympus 1030sw)had worked great for my father the previous year and as such 4 more cameras were purchased by friends/family (green olympus 1030sw).  Within 5 days all 4 green cameras had stopped working due to water entering the supposedly water tight battery or USB compartments.I was successfully able to use my new camera for 1 day, but upon entering the water on day 2 the camera's LCD screen stopped working.Of the other 3 other broken cameras, 1 stopped working immediately after going underwater, 1 stopped working on the 3rd snorkel trip and the other on snorkel day 5.While in Maui I did a quick internet search to find that this is a very common issue [...] with the Olympus 1030sw.  Additionally, while on a snorkel trip to Lanai one of the deckhands on the boat overheard our conversation about the camera and indicated hers died after 10 underwater trips.  She also said this has happened to many people/customers taking her snorkel tour.The 1 functional unit in our group (black camera) was perfectly fine for a previous 2 week Hawaii trip, but within 2 days this time the black paint had began to flake off. By day 4 all of the paint was gone and on day 5 the frame that surrounds the lens on the face of the camera fell off.Although it is cosmetically damaged, it does still function.

You have to send in a copy of your sales receipt, the warranty card, and a brief description of the problem. Sent it by priority mail (cost about $5) on the Friday after returning from vacation. Olympus made the warranty repair and returned it to me the following Friday! That was quick. They even got rid of some scratches on the camera's front black face. All works fine now, although I'm not sure that I will try it in water again! The attached repair packing slip just said \"liquid damaged\".

This one has everything I loved about the 770 plus some improvements.Olympus fixed the 2 biggest problems I had with the 770.  First being that the only button that can power on the 1030 is the actual power button.  On the 770, both the play button and the mode button could also power on the camera, which leads to drained batteries when they're easily hit accidentally while in your pocket.The other big problem that was fixed was the addition of the mode wheel (is that even what it's actually called?).  On the 770, I was always annoyed that if I wanted to switch to movie mode or one of the other scene modes from auto, I had to hit the mode button twice, select video (or whatever else I wanted), and then hit enter.  Having a new baby and enjoying taking still pictures and video, it's nice to now be able to switch very quickly just by turning the wheel between still and video.What I've always loved about Olympus cameras and still holds up here, is that they're well built.  I've used a lot of friends cameras that are other brands (won't mention any specifically), and a lot of them just feel really cheap and easily breakable.  This camera is sturdy and with the added benefit of being waterproof, shockproof, and crushproof (all up to a certain point obviously), I never worry about accidentally breaking it.  I know it can take a beating and still go strong.I won't complain about picture quality, as I think it's just fine.  Is it as good as my SLR?  No, but I don't expect it to be.  This camera does everything I want it to do and the quality is very good.I wanted to get the camera in black, but ended up with green since for some reason there's an almost 200 dollar difference.  Looking at the pictures, I wasn't crazy about the green but wasn't about to pay so much more just for a difference in color.  I was pleasantly surprised when I received the camera that the green looks much better in person than it does in the photo.  I actually really like the green now, much more than the silver that I had the 770 in.I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a point and shoot that you can take absolutely anywhere!", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, except for zoom and black color panel", "Author": "AJ \"BayAreaKayaker\"", "ReviewID": "R389EZL4DJYVHJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the black version of this camera and I have loved using it.

I discovered this Olympis 1030SW.  While it has some mixed reports on picture quality I took a chance.I was very pleasantly surprised.  I took pictures with this camera that the disposable camera could not capture.  I found some of the really bright pictures on the beach did not come out right, but with further manipulation, I was able to get good results.  Most the problem is learning curve figuring out what scene or mode to use in the camera.  I also got some very nice movie footage of dolphins.  I pretty much took the camera out without reading the manual.  So I only captured the movies in 15fps, but found out that you can change the quality to 30fps.The operations and menu's are not too difficult to figure out.For the price, I'm not sure there is a better camera for sports activities.

This camera has survived multiple hiking trips, being dropped by my three-year old, and exposure to saltwater on multiple occasions.  I have had this camera in my pocket while parachuting into the ocean...twice.  A quick rinse in the sink afterward is all that is required.

I'm very pleased with the photos it takes, being purely of a point-and-shoot variety.  The video is limited to 10 second clips when set to the high resolution mode but unlimited when set to the lower resolution.  It's not of the quality you would see in a dedicated video camera but it's great when something video-worthy happens right in front of you.The bad:The USB jack on the camera is a NON-STANDARD USB plug, unlike any I have ever seen before.  This requires me to pack an additional cord with me rather than use the same USB cable that I use with my other USB devices.  Or, I can just take out the XD card and use the card reader on my laptop.  Also, this camera is quite heavy when compared to others in its size range.

I kept the camera in Landscape mode and everytime I turned it on, I had to answer \"yes\" I wanted to be in that mode. Also, any changes I made to this setting (like light balance), I had to reset every time I turned the camera on. Also, the flip open cover is nice, but it easily slides open and turns the camera on as you slide it into your pocket.Don't get me wrong.

Worked like a charm.You do have to play with the numerous settings and modes to get some pictures to look just right -- especially in lowlight situations. (Daylight pictures were no problem.)  I found some night pics didn't always come out so well and it was very much a matter of trial & error to get them to work, so be sure to practice before trying to take pictures of an important event, trip or moment. Also the flash is not the strongest either so be sure your main subject(s) are fairly close and pretty much forget about the background showing up if it's any real distance away.  The panorama function worked really well in just about every situation and the camera can even stitch the images together for you itself and you can see the results in a few seconds.The camera fits nicely in the pocket of your shirt or pants.

I wanted something small that was water proof. Everything works well and the pictures during a sunny day are great. When there is less light, it suffers a bit.Auto mode picture taking is ok but I wish there were manual modes. It is tough to get the picture I want at night.ISO 400 and above is grainier than other compact cameras.The pictures are a bit soft but reproducible to nice prints.Water proof in the surf. You should definitely give it a fresh water rinse after use. Make sure that there is no sand in the lens cover. I heard that it would get stuck but I have not experienced this yet.It is a bit heavy for the size but it is really heavy duty I suppose for the impact resistance.XD cards are a little more expensive but it comes with an adapter to use micro SD cards. You can get 2gb micro SD for $7.99. This will allow for some serious pictures but make sure you have an extra battery to fill the card.Video mode only does 10 seconds at the higher frames per second mode which sucks but the XD-m and other newer XD-h allow for longer videos in the higher resolution modes. Ten seconds is ok because we don't do to much video with the camera. You can get more time at the 15 frames per second mode at 640x480 if needed. I will get some XD-m+ cards later for video at the highest rating later. It is just cool to be filming a video while surfing and in the tube action vid.Battery power is pretty good and sustains at prescribed projections by Olympus.Overall I really like this camera but there are little things that make it so I can't give it 5 stars so it gets 4. For a point and shoot in swamps of Mexico, deserts of the Mojave, Oceans of the pacific kayaking or surfing, and at the size it comes in and with an optional floating camera strap, it is a great camera for $280. The floating strap was $15 which was pretty good. It would really suck if it was dropped and sank to the bottom of the ocean while surfing or snorkeling.I have a Canon SD300 that takes way better quality pictures because of the manual modes, but it is very fragile. I broke 2 of them but good thing I purchased the warranty. This is a dry land camera and the size is great but not water proof. When I take this out to the beach, the salt air affects it and seems to clog it up. I have a water proof box for it but it is big and bulky. The 1030sw is the ultimate outdoors person camera. There is a pentax optio that is water proof but it is a bit bigger. Size is a big concern for us being we need something small and stealthy to fit in our gear.I also have an older Olympus C-3020 that takes awesome pictures and has more of a manual mode. Of course the lens is bigger and the pictures at 3.2 megapixels are crisper. This camera is pretty big and it tough to take around hiking on trips. It still works really well.When I got this 1030sw from Amazon, I should have ordered the accessories with it but forgot until later. They shipped really fast and I was pretty happy about it.I would recommend this camera for anybody that is into outdoors h20 sports or the likes, but be aware of the camera not allowing for full manual mode. It is just a small compact point and shoot camera built tough.4 stars given - If olympus fixed and added the things that were addressed here, they could sell a ton of these and would warrant 5 stars plus.Have fun shopping for your camera :)", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Takes a 'lickin and keeps on tickin!", "Author": "Anna Stesia \"Anna Stesia\"", "ReviewID": "RE6ZQLC2M79DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WHat an amazing camera!

I didn't have to worry about it getting wet on rainy days or if I dropped or bumped it so that was nice.  The picture quality was good, I took most on 3mg & a few on 10mg.

Water (and weatherproof) I never have to worry about it getting wet in the constant rain in SE Alaska were I live. Its small enough to slip in a pocket and takes very good pictures as well as good video. Shutter lag is minimal which has been a problem with other digital snapshot cameras. the body is small and very slippery, but the addition of a silicon skin makes it easy to hold. The photos are very sharp and the relatively large screen helps to frame shots well. I always shoot pictures at the highest resolution and the 2GB xD card holds well over 100 shots so I am not limited with the number of photos I can take. I look forward to obtaining a housing, and using this little gem while diving.My 2 minor problems with the camera are the easy of including fingers over the lens in shots, especially when shooting quick action shots, and the lack of raw mode.

Let's make it clear that I am no professional photographer, but I do see some problems with this camera which would easily make me replace it for something else.The 10 megapixels made it an ever better deal since you can enjoy your pictures up on a big screen, but here is the biggest problem with this stylus. The images don't look quite as nice as you would expect from a 10 megapixel camera. Some appear really grainy, others too dark or washed, and others have chromatic aberrations. I have minimized all of these by tweaking some of the setting in the camera, and have found that the auto setting is only good up to a certain point. Also, higher isos reveal very grainy and washed-out pictures - setting it at 200 and 400 have given me near perfect shots. Sometimes I don't feel comfortable switching it around according to the lighting, so I just go with the preset modes - and there are a whole lot of them which also give very good images.While the picture quality was really upsetting at first, once I went snorkeling my doubts about the Stylus 1030 SW completely dispersed. This camera goes where no other can go, and the pictures and movies underwater made for some good time.I definitely recommend it if you're looking for something fun, durable and with good picture quality.

The wide-angle lens is great and I think this alone is well worth the $50 price difference between this and the 850SW.

It doesn't come with them and you can only take about 5 or 6 pics without it.  I didn't know this so I had to go to Best Buy to play with my new toy the day it arrived.  oops.  Get the M+ cards (rather than \"M\") to enjoy all the features and faster speed!.I purchased this camera because of the water proof and shockproof features. From the web research, I expected it to be bigger, so the compact size is a pleasant bonus! Thus far it is performing as advertised.  I have 3 children, ages 13, 3, 2.  I have let all of them play with this camera in the house and in the pool.  It takes great pictures under water and it is perfectly OK after being dropped by a toddler! My husband cringed when I gave my new camera to our 3 year old, but I said \"It's shockproof up to 6 feet and she's only 3 feet tall.  The most she will drop it is probably 2 feet\".  He cringed even more when she did finally drop it on a tile floor.  I checked it out.  Everything is fine!  We are taking this new camera/memory saver on every future family vacation, starting with a trip to the Grandparents in TN next week.  Can't wait to see those lake pictures ... both above and below water!!.Of course every camera could have improvements, so I will include my wish list, but this in no way should take away from what a great little camera this is. There are 2 things I would like to see:1. I would like more/better zoom.2. I would like a faster recovery time between pictures, so I can take a bunch quickly and then later delete whichever ones aren't good.  I don't like that it thinks for a second or two about each picture, displays it for me, and then gets ready for the next shot.  For this issue, I can either shoot video and make pix, or there is a quick shoot feature where you get to shoot a few and then delete.  Maybe I haven't figured that one out yet, it seems weird to me..Like I said, don't let my extra wish list deter you from getting this camera.  It's my attempt at \"fair and balanced\" reporting.

My first digicam was an Olympus and I loved it, I'm still not sure why I bought a Sony after that???  Well, I'm happy to say that I'm back with Olympus again in this fine camera!Compared to the Soney Cybershot T-9, the Olympus is just slightly bigger and heavier, but not much of either.  I really like the way it is put together, feels solid and well made.  I've only used it for about a week now so I can't report thoroughly on it but here are my first impressions...The Good: Solid, well made feel.  Large LCD screen is very clear and easy to see in daylight.  Waterproof feature is great!  The macro functions are very nice, there is an LED light that can be turned on to highlight the subject.  It works well in Macro mode but not good for much more.  I'm not a pro but I think it takes awesome pictures.  The underwater shots I took on the first day (in the pool) were fantastic.  Everybody that sees them thinks they are great too!  I also took some underwater video and it came out great.  The underwater settings seem to work well but I haven't tried any other settings underwater yet.  One thing I want to try is video with sound underwater just to see what it picks up.  I am not using the software that came with the camera so I can't comment on that, but I will say that it comes with Olympus software that is pretty extensive.  I remember the version on my old Olympus was pretty good but now I just use what's included with Windows Vista, which is fine for me right now.The Not So Good: The controls are a bit small so it is sometimes difficult to get my chubby fingers on the right buttons.  Just a minor annoyance though.  The wrist strap that comes with the camera is nice but for a camera whose main feature is Waterproof, they should have included a beefier strap that could cinch up around your wrist.  If I were a to take this camera in deeper water I would want a better strap to ensure it wouldn't come off and sink to the bottom.That's all I have for now.  I've had no problems at all so far and the waterproof features are working well.

Once my son started swimming I thought how cool it would be to get a compact camera that can take pictures while in the pool... Finding very limited selection I was concerned over the quality of the camera but after receiving it all of my doubts have left me!The camera is not as lightweight as it might seem from the images. It is compact and can be carried in a pocket but it is durable. I have not tested the \"shockproof\" aspect of the camera but from its construction I assume it lives up to the hype.As for the pictures there are positives and negatives. Any outdoor picture taken has been great - including the underwater photos. The color is good and rich, action shots (taken in the right mode) turn out great and of course the big reason to get this camera, the underwater photos are stunning. Swimming is an all new experience with this camera and its a lot of fun to get this special pictures that you can't get with most cameras! The negative side are indoor pictures. While the pictures are still good and usable for prints there is visible noise in the pictures in many of those pictures - even when using the flash. The camera is usable indoors but it is at its best outdoors.I haven't taken many videos yet. Having a hi-def camcorder I didn't buy this camera for its video feature... Of course, you can take video underwater with this camera which is also fairly unique I just haven't done it yet. Note that in order to get the maximum resolution and FPS for the camera you need to specificly get the Olympus M+ media card. Non-Olympus or non-M+ Olympus cards will restrict the video to 10 seconds at maximum resolution/fps...Everyone that I have shown the camera to, the pictures and then told them the price were amazed at it and have talked about ordering one as well.

So it was a no brainer that if I were to finally hang up my trusty old Nikonos waterproof underwater camera and get a replacement it would have to be an Olympus.  I have used my Nikonos as an all purpose outdoor camera mostly for my fishing trips taking pictures of my quarry in the rivers or the salt water flats.  I rarely went diving and don't really need an underwater camera, like the Nikonos, that is waterproof up to 300 feet.  Waterproof cases are bulky and expensive and therefore it was not an option for me to consider.  I recently took my new Olympus 1030SW to my Bonefishing trip in the Bahamas and was pleasantly surprised at how advanced and user friendly the features are.  There are three features that are new to me that I find innovative.  Panorama - combining three shots into one in camera.  Guide - shoot with effects preview, allows you to compare previews of different effects such as variations of exposure, zoom, color temperature, thirdly super macro - allows you to shoot super close ups.There isn't really anything I dislike about the camera.  The compact size is great, the battery last more than a day of constant shooting (without flash),  writing to the memory card is abit slow and can get in the way if you need to take multiple shots quickly,  Using the faster M Plus card, which I should have bought,  may speed things up.I highly recommend this camera to all anglers and others sportsmen near water,  you can hang it around your neck or put it in your pocket and not worry about it until you need to take a picture. Having a camera with you at all times, instead of putting it back into a waterproof bag,  ensures that you don't miss out on any photo opportunities", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "1030SW is a Great Camera!", "Author": "G.

We also live on the lake and were always worried about dropping the camera in the water and getting our hands dry before using it.  I don't know how many good shots I missed due to being wet.  Problem solved.  This camera is rugged and can withstand the weather.  If you have been researching this camera, you know it is waterproof to 33' (with underwater snap shot and video modes), freezeproof to -14 degrees, crush proof up to 220 lbs, and shock proof to 6'.  There is no other digital camera that can withstand this type of abuse.I am extremely happy with this camera.  Others have suggested the scene modes (on the menu) to be an extra step, but I like the way it outlines each mode, so you can have the right mode for the situation.  The camera does great in auto mode and I've found the scene modes to be very helpful.  The under water pictures are very clear and the scene options work well.  My biggest surprise was the clarity on the \"fireworks\" mode.  It really does great!The only downside is the zoom.  I'm used to 10x optical on my last Olympus while this one has 3.6x.  However, the other features far outweigh the lack of zoom.  You can't expect high optical zoom in a camera the size of a deck of cards.If you buy this camera, you must get the M+ or H card.  These high speed memory cards allow you to shoot video at 30fps for the entire length of your memory.  Standard XD cards and M cards only allow for 10 second clips.  My 2GB M+ allows for 18 minutes of consecutive video at 30fps.  The XD M+ and H cards are also 1.5 times faster, so the \"next shot\" delay is shorter.I would recommend this camera to anyone who is active.  Standard digitals are just too fragile.

And during the six hours it was probably turned on for 5 because i hardly turned it off. I was taking so many pictures! Also if you need to know, the camera was in the water pretty much the entire time possible. Gave me no problems. So after 5 hours of it being on, I checked the battery life on the screen.

I've never had a problem with this in the past, and I own an Olympus C7070 Wide Zoom that works fine. Unfortunately, with this new Stylus, when I plug into the card reader, I get an error message that the card needs to be formatted. If I format the card in the reader, when I put it back in the camera, the camera says it needs to format the card. Ugh!I need a solution that does not involve plugging the camera directly into the PC (impractical because the camera might be out on another job) and does not involve buying an additional card reader (impractical because I already have a multi-card reader plugged into my PC, and I use it to read cards from other cameras, and I don't need any more network drive conflicts right now).Please provide an acceptable solution.

But I'm still returning it as you will read.  I consider myself a skilled serious amateur photographer and currently own two Panasonic Lumix cameras (LX-1 & LX-2). When I shoot photos I am apt to change the exposure value for photos, consciously choose the f-stop and shutter speed when the conditions are less than ideal, and I am highly conscious of lighting and framing issues.  But I swim and wanted to take underwater movies for my stroke analysis.  I earlier bought a DiCAPac plastic enclosure for my Panasonic but decided to stop using the enclosure after the plastic began to tear along the opening seam.  So when I found the Olympus 1030SW I thought great! I can shoot underwater movies without a housing!  The Good. . . . I really like the shadow compensation technology.  You can actually accomplish it in the computer but it is kind of cool to have it as a feature in the camera.  I also like the length of time that the battery lasts before it needs to be recharged.  The camera has a led light that you can choose to illuminate macro shots. This is a great feature if you  intend to do close up macro shots. You can use the led as an emergency small light in the hotel room on vacation (if you can find the button).  There is also a built-in alarm clock that could be quite handy. THe arrow pad control was intuitive.  The camera has built in controls to modify or manipulate images (black and white, cropping, framing it, color manipulation) for those who don't have a computer.  I do, however, question the ability to actually see the image well enough on the camera screen to intelligently modify the image in the camera.  The not so good. . . . The most annoying feature of the camera is that you must be very careful that you don't put your finger in front of the lens window.  It's very easy to do; I know, I did it even though I was aware of the problem.I do understand that this camera is designed to be used by the occasional photographer, but at $350 (I paid $400 at Amazon when it first came out) it seems that there should be at least some ability to consciously choose some settings without having to go into the \"Mode Dial\" \"SCN\" selection menu to find a comparable scene.  The Mode Dial has the following settings:AUTO: \"Shooting pictures with full automatic settings. The camera determines the optimum settings for the shooting conditions automatically\" It changes ISO [sensitivity and color balance settings I think] - This is basically the point and shoot mode.Program auto: \"Set the optimum aperture value and shutter speed. The camera automatically sets the optimum aperture value and shutter speed for the brightness of the subject.\"  I didn't really try to figure it out, but I never did understand the difference between AUTO and PROGRAM AUTO modes.IMAGE STABILIZATION MODE: \"Shooting pictures using digital image stabilization. This function reduces the blur caused by a moving subject or camera movement when taking pictures.\"  So I wonder why there is a mode just for this rather than having a single button to turn it on and off? So is it like the Program Auto, or the Auto mode with image stabilization? Quien sabe?SCN mode: \"Shoot pictures by selecting a scene mode according to the situation. You can shoot pictures by selecting a scene mode according to the situation.\"  So there are more than a dozen \"scenes\" that you are supposed to scroll down through to find one similar to the one you are going to shoot.  Here's the list \"PORTRAIT / LANDSCAPE / LANDSCAPE +PORTRAIT / NIGHT SCENE*1 /NIGHT+PORTRAIT*1 / SPORT / INDOOR / CANDLE*1 / SELF PORTRAIT /AVAILABLE LIGHT*1 / SUNSET*1 / FIREWORKS*1 / CUISINE / BEHIND GLASS /DOCUMENTS / AUCTION*2 / SHOOT & SELECT1*2 / SHOOT & SELECT2*3 /BEACH & SNOW / PRE-CAPTURE MOVIE / UNDERWATER SNAPSHOT*4 /UNDERWATER WIDE1*4 / UNDERWATER WIDE2*4*5 / UNDERWATER MACRO\".  So what is a poor bloke to do?  I know.  \"Oh wait! Let me shoot the picture of you, Johnnie, blowing out the candles. Margot! Tell him to wait!  Now, Hmmm.  Where was that mode? I know there supposed to be a way to take a picture of my kiddie blowing out a candle if you'll just give me a minute to find it. . . . \"  Methinks the various scenes that you can select thru the SCN mode probably address lighting issues, light color issues, etc. But still! It is too impractical to use it. I doubt many will ever use it though Olympus may try to push it as a selling point.  Now, we come to the reason that I returned the camera.  I play golf as well so today I went to use the camera in the movie mode for the first time in order to record my swing on video[swimming was to be later this week].  I had already set the camera to the VGA movie mode but when I pushed the button it turns out that you can only record ten seconds of video in VGA mode! That's ridiculous.  There must be a lack of horsepower under the hood that it can't stream that resolution to the memory card, but it can in the QVGA mode since the resolution is less good. So, when I go to Hawaii in a couple of months and I want to shoot a video of my wife snorkeling with the dolphins in the water I'll be able to get ten seconds of video. Sounds peachy keen! That combined with the the dismal ability to choose the aperture and f-stop make it a sure returner for me.

I don't call this a waterproof camera so don't buy it if that is what you want to use it for.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Olympus 1030SW", "Author": "Twinkle in Salt Lake", "ReviewID": "R2R4YXZZ90DU90", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wow, I'm glad I waited.

I plugged my fully-charged camera into my laptop via USB and within 20 minutes the battery was completely dead.Then I noticed page 62 on the Instruction Manual where is says: During the conditions described below, power is consumed continuously and the battery becomes exhausted quickly: - The camera is connected to a computer or printer.So, connecting the 1030 via USB doesn't charge the battery as anyone with a cell phone or PDA would expect, it actually kills it! Quickly! Connecting the camera and getting distracted for a few minutes means you have a dead battery and no more shooting for 2-3 hours while recharge it!
