I compared a lot of models before purchasing this one (specifically the Sony Cybershot DSC-WX300, Nikon Coolpix S9500 and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS25).  I am so pleased I selected the Olympus SZ-31MR!  I especially love how easy it is to hold with one hand-good for pics on the go.  The picture quality is wonderful!  I'm not sure I'd ever use most of those \"magic\" modes, but the action setting is great-I can catch my kids in mid-jump.  and the clarity of my images-even when using the higher zoom settings is fabulous!  I'm an avid scrapbooker, often enlarging a photo to full 12\"x 12\" size for a page background and the quality of these pictures satisfies my high standards.  I'd buy this camera every day of the week and twice on Sunday!", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Daniel Proano", "ReviewID": "R1LR0XTARZ6LAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My fourth olympus, but this is the best one, is better than I hope, amazing images quality and in the future I probably buy another olympus with the same seller.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Summary didn't contain all facts", "Author": "Diana L.

My problem isn't with the camera - it's the directions.  A day or so after the camera was shipped, I received a notice it was on the way - AND, Oh By The Way - it stated that all the instructions and manual are in Japanese.  This should have been stated in the original description - I feel it was very misleading.  How in the ding-dong am I supposed to use it or let my husband try it out?  I would have purchased the camera elsewhere if I had known.  This is the first time I've ever been really unhappy with an order from Amazon.  Am looking to see if I can find this model elsewhere - with the directions in ENGLISH!", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shipped directly from Japan.", "Author": "RadSret \"SR\"", "ReviewID": "R2JABTOXEY0HEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Shipped directly from Japan and pretty fast.

This camera has everything i need, i am not a professional photographer, and my needs might be different to others, but with 16mp this camera has a good resolution and the photo's i am taking look great. It is very easy to use as a point and click camera, but also has setting to play with if thats your thing, and i have been experimenting also ;) being able to take video too is a plus, and i find that i am unable to really find any fault with the camera, considering price and specs, it seems rather reasonable to me. I have seen mention that at full optical zoom it is hard to get clear shots without some blur , because of shake, but having done a few shots myself i find that the photos for me arent too bad at all.. and when i placed on a tripod, then the issue wasnt even there.. sharp pics!Overall i am pleased with the camera, i got this just as a low priced , take everyday photos kind of camera, but the added extras of video, and resolution and zoom, mean if i want to become a better taker of photo's or take lots and be more serious with it i can", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "140.83\n352.075", "Name": "SZ-31MR Silver - 16.0 MP", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O9x4Tnm1L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00763EUXC"}}
