Luker \"Johhny Bravo\"", "ReviewID": "R2KU0U7CBFRHQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I reveived this after my grandfather's Minolta 35mm film camera broke on me while in the Navy.  I got this camera with a 35 and 55 mm lenses in 1994 and love it.  To this day it serves me well and while I take pictures more often with the Nikon DSLRs I have this one is always in stand by.  You will have to learn all about photography to use this camera and it will make the transition to DSLR much easier.  There is far less to go wrong and even if the battery goes out for the light meter it will work and you can still shoot worry free.You will have to learn how to load film, advance film, set film ISO into the camera, and work lens apature rings.  The light meter does require a small battery but works well in quickly identifying if you need to \"open or close\" the apature ring.  Focus is easily identified through the viewfinder and the lack of buttons, settings, and icons forces you to focus on what really matters, framing, lighting, and timing.I have a flash, shutter release cable and it shares mounts on my tripod easily.  Its light, tough, and so easy to use that once I am dialed into my area settings I can capture pictures as well as on digital.  The use of film will make you rethink how you take pictures as you have only 24 or 36 per roll.  I have used digitals to get complex settings and then dialed into the Pentax and the results were far superior.One note, you must pay attention to film and film processing.  Black and white is not too difficult to do yourself if you have the equipment.  If not you MUST get high quality film and go to actual labs and not drug stores to get the film processed.  This way you can request special features in processing byond the matt or gloss finish and print sizes.  I highly recommend this for anyone not satisfied with point and shoots and ready to move up to real photography.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pentax K1000", "Author": "Jeffery M.

You will learn photography by shooting with this camera. The label that this camera has received as being a good beginner camera is somewhat misleading considering you have to load and wind the film yourself, you have to set the ISO yourself, you have to set the aperture yourself, you have to set the shutter speed yourself, and you have to focus it yourself. If you want to be a good photographer this is the camera to use if you can get it and you still use film.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "I've had mine since 1982.  Still using it.", "Author": "L. Gildart", "ReviewID": "R18VF3IUBJPV3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My k1000 will be 30 years old this Christmas, and it has been the most reliable camera I have ever owned.  My lenses are still nice and sharp.  My light meter and flash shoe still work.  I have probably changed the battery 3 times.  There are no light leaks.  Everything works just like the day I got it.This is a great first camera for any person who wants to learn about photography:  exposure, composition, etc.  With digital point and shoots, it's really easy to just be a documentarian and rely on photoshop or filters to fix things up a bit later, but there's no real incentive to get things right in the first instance.  Film - real film - requires patience and discipline and a critical eye.  Which is why I am teaching my 11 year old son to use this.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "a new old love", "Author": "Desert Gypsy \"A Brooklyn Girl Out West\"", "ReviewID": "R30QFX5B1TR22L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After recently buying a fairly high end compact DSLR, my interest in photography has been keenly renewed. As a result, I became nostalgic for this camera from my college days and decided to re-investigate it. I was surprised to find it still in demand and well reviewed as a camera that captures professional looking results. Even in novice hands like mine I'd have to say the pictures rarely fail to impress. I've added a photo (sorry, incredibly *bad* scan) of the kind of picture I captured with this camera.If you can find the review by \"a writer/reader/listener\" I think that review gives a fair and accurate impression of this camera.Would highly recommend this camera as a great starter piece for a beginner interested in film photography.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pentax K1000", "Author": "J.

Wagner", "ReviewID": "RPJ73SO06PKWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Solidly built, this camera offers beginners FULL MANUAL CONTROL over all aspects of their photography. Nearly bulletproof, this camera belongs with you at all times. Coupled with a 55mm lens (approximately what your eye sees) you are ready to capture what is around you. I have nothing whatsoever bad to say about this camera, though I sold mine years ago in favor of a cheap pocket digital camera.This is one of the best cameras ever produced for the mass market. No, it is NOT a point-and-shoot camera. YES it will afford you control that you might find only in much higher-end cameras, which is CRUCIAL for learning.Photo student?

Larue \"Kelly\"", "ReviewID": "R17IFSWL4OHNE0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Pentax SL that was one step below the Spotmatic in 1965  My camera preceded the K1000 but is identical in appearance.  It took great pictures in both color and B&W.;  I used it for years.  The camera was rugged and reliable.  The only time I had a problem was when I jammed the film advance lever by snapping it too fast.  I had to take it in to be released.  The repairman said it's a common problem with these cameras and the repair was quick and cheap.  Never had another problem and used the camera for over 20 years, a lot, before selling it.  Learning the fundamentals of manual picture taking is not difficult.  You pick your speed based on what you're photographing or what depth of field you want.  Turn your aperture ring until the meter needle is centered, focus and go.  This might sound complicated but it's not.  You can learn what you need by reading a short book.  The only trick is getting the speed right and you catch on quick.  I used to take time exposures just for the fun of it.  I took a night time picture with me in it once and the phone rang.  I answered it, came back, turned off the camera and I got this great picture with a transparent ghost sitting in it.  Another time I took a time exposure of a completely dark street and left the lens open too long.  I was amazed when the picture came out looking like it was taken in daylight.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "film!", "Author": "Gregory L.

My first camera was a Pentax K1000 with the basic stock kit 50mm f/2.0 lens.  It was, and still is, perfect for any beginning photographer.  This is a fully manual camera.  You use the largely intuitive internal light meter to help you set the shutter speed and f-stop, and focus is also manual.  This is the kind of cameral to start with if you really want to learn and understand the basics of photography,  E.g., How do different combinations of film speed, f-stop, and shutter speed affect a shot?  This camera will help you figure that out.The body is all metal construction, and is one rugged little unit!  I hauled mine all around the US.  I took it skiing, tide pooling, hiking, to Japan and back, and used it throughout my undergraduate and graduate school years.  I relied heavily on it, since some of my research was based on photo-records of marine animals living in the field.  I do have to admit that I lost two Pentax K1000 camera bodies to saltwater corrosion, but that was not the camera's fault, it was mine.  And I kept going back to the Pentax K1000 camera body, and the original lens survived all trials.I used this camera to take literally 1000s of photos and slides.Some people would say that film cameras are outdated, and in a way they may be right, but just like an artist develops better when they learn traditional methods before moving on to digital tools, a photographer will be better if they learned the basics on an all-manual film camera (including developing) than if they jump straight to digital.  At least that's my opinion.Even so, I have finally made the jump to a digital SLR, and I've let my Pentax K1000 go.  Even so, there is a certain nostalgia I will always have for the Pentax K1000 - the same feeling I have for my first car.5 stars through and through.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "I still prefer it to DSLR", "Author": "dep1699", "ReviewID": "R1QDS3IR91WFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes films are expensive, but this forces you to think before to shot.
