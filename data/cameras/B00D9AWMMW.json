While it fits it is also far too distorted to be of any value. I did increase zoom at a 55 setting but by the time you extended the master lens to 50% of the zoom capacity in this case around 150 it was completely clouded and would not even manually focus. Not really even worth one star in my book", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awful", "Author": "Juan Botero Londo\u00f1o \"Juan\"", "ReviewID": "R2N8Y0LBWEF9KD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Awful, dont even worth to carry it in your bag, distorted view, low light, awful photos.
