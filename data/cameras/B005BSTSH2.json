{"Reviews": [{"Title": "They Got Some Things Right, But Not Acceptable", "Author": "Stephen Schiller \"extra terrestrial\"", "ReviewID": "R1LB6W0J9EZGXT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Compared to the Foscam camera I bought earlier this camera initially seemed much better. Picture quality is very good. It came with a complete manual that explained most of what I needed to know. The Foscam manual was more like a single page of cryptic notes in mangled English that one had to decipher. The YCam has a lot of nice features: you can set zones for motion trigger, you can record on motion or at given intervals, you have an e-mail sent to you on motion trigger, there is a phone app that allows you to monitor the camera, you can supposedly use other software with it, you can hard wire other devices to it to respond on motion trigger (such as a light or bell), and more.Unfortunately I can now only get only the a small subset of these features to work. Initially most things worked at a test location inside the house. After I mounted it outside in a rain-sheltered area most things stopped working. Even after I tried rebooting several times. Here are the list of features that stopped working:Wireless: initially the wireless worked fine. Then when I moved it outside at first the option for setting up the wireless completely disappeared from the setup menu! Then for some other reason I disconnected the ethernet cable and when I plugged it back in the menu item re-appeared. However that was of little help because it could no longer establish a wireless connection. Even though the camera can find the network. Note that my lap top in the exact same location has full bars for wireless. And the distance from the router is only about 50 feet.Setting zones for motion detection (i.e. trigger rectangle and sensitivity): the new settings I enter only seem to be retained sporadically.Motion detection: used to be reliable, if over sensitive. Now motion detection is sporadic. It only seems to trigger on half of the obvious motion events.I was never able to get to send an e-mail on motion detection. On the other hand I commend them for having examples in the manual for how to fill in the fields for popular mail servers (such gmail). This might be my fault but I was pretty careful about filling everything in as they said and I am fairly compute savvy.Those are the most egregious failures. It seems like something went haywire with the software after I restarted it outside. I sent in a complaint ticket and haven't heard from them in weeks.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Hardware but software needs work", "Author": "Glenn T.

Software is still buggy. Sound is not very good and recorded clips play at a fast rate of speed.With some better software this could be a very good camera.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Eyes every where!!

We even tried to use the Netgear Range Extender.  It just doesn't go though metal.  I wanted it to watch inside a metal sided garage/work shop.We could get great results farther out and through a wood sided structure.  If you wanted to watch your driveway or detached non-metal garage and understand computer net-working, this is a great product.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Honesty", "Author": "Unhappy", "ReviewID": "R27TSW3E9GQUNG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered 2 Y-cam Bullet HD, Network Camera and this was after ordering 3 of the same thing.  the 3 showed up no issues.
