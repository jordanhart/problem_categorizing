{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for photo enthusiasts who travel", "Author": "Joseph E. Brackman \"PhotoJoe\"", "ReviewID": "R3B9YC3PQ7T3ND", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just had this for a week or so now, and it's my first digital, though I do wedding photography (on film and rented high-end digital cams) and I'm pretty experienced with photography.My wife and I were with some friends in Flagstaff, AZ, and in addition to kicking around town, we hiked Humphrey's Peak (at 12,633', the highest peak in AZ). For night shots, portraits, panoramas (with Stitch Assist-- see below), scenics, and candids, this is a great camera.It's not as fast and responsive as my film camera, but no point-and-shoot digital is at this point. The only cameras that are that quick in focusing and processing are the high-end digital SLR bodies. So for the price, this is a very responsive and able camera.The Stitch Assist feature is very impressive. With the included software, I just downloaded the photos to Zoom Browser EX, selected the folder where the photos shot with the Stitch Assist mode resided (one folder for each panorama), and the external stitching program automatically put the photos together. There's a little manual control if you like, but it was so easy that I left it alone. I'm normally a tweaker, but it was great without my help. :) I have some great panoramas of the summit of Humphrey's as we were getting to the top.The Macro mode is great as well, as I got a really nice shot of some of the ice pellets that had fallen on the ground. I have a macro setup for my film body, but it's a pain.Vertical and horizontal photos are automatically rotated if you prefer-- a very nice feature. I would prefer not to have to go through hundreds of photos and do post-rotation. I've done it with wedding photos, and it's a pain.The lens on this camera is very good. Overall clarity is good and distortion is low. There is some barrel distortion at the wide angle setting, but it's not too objectionable. Plus the f/2.0 - f/3.0 speed is a boon to low-light shooting. The front-facing flash on this camera is the typical small kind of flash that's also close to the lens. I've always found this kind of lighting harsh and unflattering, so I like to shoot with ambient light if possible. Now that I don't have to use color correction filters and can have the white balance suited to the light color temperature, I can shoot indoors without flash! Finally!Noise levels are pretty good, but not great compared with the high-end digital bodies. Again, not a fair comparison, so for the money, very good. Just not as good as is possible. I can dream, can't I?The only thing that I would like is more zoom range. I guess I could've gotten the Pro 1 with a 10x zoom, but the 35-140 range is good for many things, from scenics to portraits. I also could get one or both of the wide angle/telephoto conversion lenses.A great camera for the money.", "Date": "October 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "Everything I Want in a Digital Camera", "Author": "Gordon S. Marlowe", "ReviewID": "RO9TECOOR2GEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon G6 is a great camera.  I upgraded from a Canon Powershot A80 to the G6.  The A80 showed me that Canon makes a good camera, but was lacking a few features I really wanted.To me, this camera is a perfect collection of compromises.  I want a small camera for family snapshots, that's easy to use.  I want a large, capable camera for art work like portraits and landscape, and action shots like sports and recreation.When I'm on vacation, and want some snaps of the kids goofing around or of dinner or something, I don't need a camera that makes me jump through hoops to get a decent shot, I just want to point and shoot.  In full auto, or aperature priority, or shutter speed priority, the pictures are usually sharp and crisp.  Set the image size to one of the medium or small settings and you can use the high speed multi-shot feature to get a series of action shots that guarantee that you'll get at least a few good ones.I have no qualms about setting this camera to auto, handing this camera to a person with little or no photgraphic experience, and letting them click away.  It's easy enough to learn that most folks can be taking nice pictures in less than an hour, and pros can be taking great pictures in no time at all.On the other hand, a lot of the work I do is very artistic, and involves using manual settings.  When going for the perfect picture, it is often necessary to adjust the focus, aperature, and shutter speed to get the exact picture you want.  This camera has manual focus, a feature I sorely missed on my older Powershot A80.Another thing that bothers me on most other cameras, is that you have to wade through a bewilderingly large collection of menu options to make the smallest changes.  While I can understand using a layer or two of menus for things like basic settings (time, format a CF card) I can't see it for something as basic as film speed or white balance.Which is why I love this camera.  The following items are one button away:FlashFlash Output LevelMulti-imageTime delay photoAutofocus areaMacro modeManual FocusWhite BalanceZoom in / outFilm Speed (50 to 400)Picture mode (auto, Manual, Manual preset 1 and 2, Av, Tv, Portratit, Landscape, Backlit, Panorama, movie)My favorite things about this camera:Battery life is excellent.  I bought a spare battery, but I've never actually use the one that came with it in less than a day.  It charges fast too.Picture quality:  The larger lens allows for better pictures in low light conditions, and it is very clear.  The large CCD allows you to get pictures in a large enough resolution to print out fairly large copies and have them look very good.Ergonomic.  This is a very comfortable camera to hold for a long time.  It's not quite in the same range as some much more expensive units, but I've never gotten tired from holding it.  Plus, all the buttons you need to hit while running it are right there under your fingertips.  The scroll wheel under your right index finger is very intuitive to operate.  Push it to change modes, roll it to change the settings.  The fold out screen allows you to take pictures from odd angles without ever having to lay down on your back for a picture.  Plus, the fold out screen feels very solidly built, not like it'll snap off in your hands.  I was always worried about my Powershot A80, as it didn't feel very solid.It works well with my computer, which runs Linux.  I use gtkam, a great camera programIt has an infrared remote that can be used to take pictures without worrying about camera shake.  This is very useful for group pictures you'd like to be in yourself.User savable white balance settings.Real flash shoe.  This camera takes a standard Canon flash unit.Manual focus mode puts a close up of the center of the screen right in the middle of the picture for you to check the focus with. This would be really bothsome for composing pictures, except that when you half depress the shutter button, the small zoomed square in the center disappears and leaves you with the whole picture.The rapid fire photo option is very useful for action shots, and some candid stuff, like subway pictures.The mechanical view finder is more than just an adornment on this camera.  It's quite good, and it changes its field of view according to the current zoom setting.  It also has a focus adjustment on it.  This is very nice if you wear glasses, as it lets you adjust the view finder to your eye, and you can get your eye right up to it, and not keep bumping your glasses into the back of the camera.Very wide open Fstop of 2.0 to very closed off 8.0.And lastly, it remembers virtually everything you setup the last time it was on or in a certain mode, and reverts to those settings the next time you turn it on or switch modes.  This includes things like white balance, settings that were NOT remembered by my Powershot A80.Now for the negatives:The door that covers the USB port / DC input, and AV output is very easy to catch in the swivelling / revolving fold out screen, and as the screen takes a fare bit of effort to revolve, it's quite likely you'll have snapped the door in half before you notice it's gone and gotten itself caught in the spinning LCD screen that's passing by.  If it's gotten a little bent, it will get caught every time by the fold out screen until you snap it off or bend it back in place.The flash is way too close to the lens, which makes for some pretty obvious shadows in the bottom right hand corner of some photos.  Luckily, I'm not much for flash usage, and if I was, I'd probably spring for a real flash that sat in the hot shoe.  Still, if you're looking for a great built in flash, this is NOT the camera for you.Slow focus, and the autofocus can become confused by objects within a few yards, and never really focus.  Plus, focusing is pretty slow.  If you are looking for a camera with a very fast, nearly perfect autofocus, you might do better with another camera.Movies are limited to 3 minutes maximum, which seems rather arbitrary.  Even 5 minutes would be a big step up, as it would allow me to catch the average musical performance in one step.Final Word:This is a great compromise camera for someone who really wants two separate cameras but can't afford them.  It's a good snap shot camera, and a good big lense, big body, big CCD machine capable of creating art.It's not the best at either of those categories when compared to other cameras, but for one that does both, it represents a a perfect compromise at a pretty reasonable price.", "Date": "November 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "The perfect fit...", "Author": "Matt A. Kurkowski \"Electronic Addict\"", "ReviewID": "R2XF3RQMUTWNV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been researching digital cameras for some time before making my purchase of my G6 a few weeks ago.  For a few years, I've been shooting with my Minolta Maxxum 5 SLR, because it was lightweight and gave me all the things I needed in a camera.  I broke into digital slowly (as most people did given that just a few years ago, a 2.0MP digital camera ran about $300).  I had a meager Fuji A340 and then moved up to a Canon SD100 which I loved-small with decent images.  I looked around at the digital SLR's, but for what I do, I didn't like two things about them: price and size.  Often when I travel, I tote my camcorder and a camera with me.  Last year, I went to Europe and brought along my Maxxum 5 (for quality shots), my Canon SD100 (for quick, easy shots) and my camcorder, a JVC GR-DV500u for video.  I thought my arm was going to fall off a week into the trip.  The solution: Combine the cameras, i.e. the Canon G6.The G6 offers the easy of a point and shoot digital with the image quality of a digital SLR.  The ergonomics are the best I've ever felt in a camera--the grip is even better than on my Maxxum giving every shot a confident, steady feel.  The lens is fantasticly bright and the colors are accurate.  Whenever possible, I shoot without a flash because I've always found that flash lighting from a camera's on-board flash is often harsh, but Canon has an answer for that too with its adjustable flash output and tight gain control on higher ISO settings.  They included all the nice little extras like the included remote control and lighted top LCD read-out.  Surprisingly, I find myself using the Intravolometer feature quite often to do timelapse photography.  It is a perfect balance of size, price and features.  This is a camera you won't mind taking to a party or taking on a weekend photo-excursion.  The optical viewfinder is quite generous for a camera in this range also.  The ability to shoot RAW images is greatly appreciated, and the fact it uses CompactFlash is excellent.  I got a 1GB card from Sandisk at BestBuy for a measly $68 after rebate.  Hitachi also makes microdrives for CompactFlash slots at very resonable prices too- 4GB is only going to set you back $199--I can remember when the 512Mb cards cost that.[...]I can't say enough about this camera!", "Date": "January 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "A great mid-range digital camera", "Author": "Catherine Michael \"catherinemichael\"", "ReviewID": "RBA1GSX7RKYOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third digital camera, but it's been a few years since the second and it was definitely obsolete. I was tempted to go top of the line, because I've two excellent SLRs (Nikon and Minolta) with all the trimmings, but the prices made that unfeasible right now.I'm very satisfied with the features of the Canon G6 however; I've taken about 400 shots so far, plus one movie, tried out all the software for stitching panoramas together, etc. I still mainly use PhotoShop, but the Canon software is quite good.The photo quality is excellent, including color and the opticalzoom and wideangle range is good for most purposes. The macro setting also does a nice job.The controls are easy to use for the most part for anyone at all familiar with full featured SLRs, and better than most. I've made very few mistakes in the field as a result of control confusion.What I'm less thrilled about (nitpicking):Like most electronics these days, even if you've got very small hands like me, it is hard to keep from getting a finger in the wrong place, just about every square inch is covered with a control. I would have liked to have an insert (like Nikon supplies) to cover the flash hotshoe contacts. And every time I remove the battery or memory card, I have to watch out to grab the camera by the few areas that don't have a control on them. Also, the cable input has a typical tiny plastic door that would be all too easy to break off, and the neck strap attachment is too close to the memory card door, and tends to interfere with it opening all the way.Also, in preview mode it tells you how many shots you have taken but not how many left, and in shooting mode, vice versa. It is annoying to have to switch to shooting mode to see how many left, especially if you are using the lens cover, because then the lens deploys out, and you have to remember to take the lens cover off first (deploying the lens with the cover on is a no-no.)I also got the camera case designed for the G6. Again like all too many \"cases\" it is a tight fit, only has a single inside pocket that you can only get an extra card in and still get the camera in too. And the case would not really be good dust protection and it zips up the sides but the top opening is just covered by a flap. And because of the tight and awkward fit, it is easy to accidentally turn the camera on, deploying the lens, while putting the camera into the case. The case comes with a belt loop, but you have to supply your own belt, and it has no other strap or handle except a tiny loop located at the top end of on side zipper, where it just gets in the way. Not a good design.I also checked out some of the accessories available, like additional lens and flash, but they're very expensive, like the macro lights are more than the camera! So I don't know if I'll get any of the add-ons later on.But overall, the G6 is already my next favorite camera to my Nikon SLR, powerful yet easy to use, and even fun! Definitely 5 stars for the camera, 1 star for the case.", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Amazing images, but a bit unresponsive", "Author": "R. van Bakel", "ReviewID": "R2Q6WEFVAH7EMJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At 7.1 megapixels, this camera delivers images that measure 3072 x 2304 pixels. But a robust megapixel count isn't all the G6 has going for it. Megapixels are meaningless if the optics and the camera's guts are substandard. A lot of high-megapixel cameras create images that lack smoothness, lifelikeness, and detail. The G6 is a total champ in those respects.I've used it for five days now. This is a preliminary verdict.* PROS of the Powershot G6:Very good color accuracy, very good resolution, virtually noisefree even at 400 ISO. AMAZING detail and sharpness, the equivalent of my Nikon D70 digital SLR (?!). Very good macro performance. Built-in neutral-density filter. Fast lens in terms of sensitivity (f2.0). Fast monitor with swivel feature. Pretty much all the user controls you would find on a pro DSLR.* CONS of the Powershot G6:ISO doesn't go beyond 400. Only 4x optical zoom. Lens slow to zoom: 3 seconds from wide to full tele. Slow startup: 3 to 4 seconds until ready for first shot. Noticeable shutter lag, I'd say about half a second. Unresponsive overall if you're used to a DSLR. Too big to easily slip into most pockets. Annoying ON button that's too easy to activate when you stuff the camera into a bag or a tight coat pocket. Not available in a more professional-looking black version.All in all, it's a very good camera that delivers stunning images for the money. I don't think that from an image quality point of view, there's currently a better prosumer camera on the market, unless you step up to an SLR like the EOS D20. But I do find that the reviews at dpreview, steve's digicams and a few other prominent photo sites glossed over the G6's shortcomings. In daily use, the camera is nowhere near as perfect as the online articles suggested. Especially that stupid ON button and the unresponsiveness really affect the pleasure of using it.To be fair, though, the half-second shutter lag and the snail-like speed with which the camera gets ready after you turn it on are hardly exclusive to the G6; other brands and other non-SLR models exhibit the same failings. It's just the nature of the beast, I guess. Bottom line: if you can live with the few drawbacks and are looking for top-notch image quality from a relatively small (but by no means tiny) package, the Powershot G6 delivers.", "Date": "March 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Powershot G6 - a Great Option to Expensive SLRs", "Author": "toedtoes \"toedtoes\"", "ReviewID": "RQERHKRRNU6K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been using a Powershot A20 (2 megapixel) camera for several years and decided to upgrade to a digital camera that gave me the ability to learn and use shutter speeds, lenses, etc.  I didn't want to spend $1,000 or more on a camera that required instant knowledge of basic photography (it's been many years since I tried to manually focus).  The G6 has provided everything I wanted.  By using the various modes (Auto, P, Tv, Av and M), I can take point & shoot shots for general use and still have the option to use manual controls to learn the best shutter speed for water shots, etc.  The 4x optical zoom is fine for most shots, and with the 1.75x teleconverter you increase that to 7x.  The macro and supermacro setings are absolutely fantastic - I've got shots of dew drops on flowers that are amazing.  There are many other settings in the menu and function areas worth looking at.  The vivid setting punches up colors (perfect for flowers, etc. but be careful to change it back when shooting people), the ND filter is great when you want to use slow shutter speeds, and the flash sync allows you to change when the flash goes off.  One of the coolest abilities of this camera is the ability to shoot in Jpeg and, during the review period right after taking the shot, push the flash button and your shot is converted into RAW.  This means that you don't need to take all your shots in RAW (just in case you get that one special shot).  As RAW reduces your storage capacity by more than half, this is wonderful.  The battery life is one of the best - I can get about 3-5 days of average use (50-80 photos/day) on one battery charge.  I bought one extra battery and I haven't found myself without power yet.  I use one til it dies, pop in the other and finish my day, then that night I charge the first (it only takes 90 minutes) and the next day I'm ready to go again.  No more pockets filled with disposable batteries.In respect to the included 32mb card, you definitely want more (512mb minimum) - however, in the world of digital cameras, 32mb included is pretty good.  Many still include an 8mb card only.Memory storage at the Large/Superfine (3072 x 2304) setting are as follows:32mb - 9 shots64mb - 19128mb - 40256mb - 81512mb - 1631gb - 3272gb - 645Note that these numbers are affected by additional settings such as landscape, wide angle, zoom, macro and supermacro, in addition to the complexity of the shot composition (landscape vs. single flower).  However, in my usage, I have found them to be accurate enough to bank on.All in all, this camera has provided me with a great \"point and shoot\" camera with great advancement potential.  In addition, it actually assists me in learning photographic techniques (use the Tv mode and manually set your shutter speed, the camera automatically sets the best matching aperture setting - after a while you start to get a feel for what combinations work best).", "Date": "March 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Powerful advanced digital zoom - pitiful instruction booklet", "Author": "Rudy \"pain-doc\"", "ReviewID": "R1QVULZM8J92CM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having used (and reviewed) the precursor G3 model, time came to step up from 4MP to 7 MP. No disappointment there - uncompressed RAW files come out beautifully, and can be tailored exquisitely with the enclosed software. The slighltly larger (2\") LCD is sharp, bright & clear, and still (praise be) swivels as nicely as ever; the menus are crisply lucid; and my G3 accessories (tele lens, battery pack, etc) remain compatible. The display panel (at last) can be illuminated when light is dim, and that irksome view of the lens barrel that used to obstruct the optical viewfinder has been corrected (finally) by recessing the lens and relocating the finder. The consistently high-rated 4x zoom lens remains identical to that in the preceding models; it is claimed to have improved antireflective coating.The body is a bit smaller and lighter than the G3 or G5, but this still is no pocket camera; and that attractive black finish of the G5 has been changed back to the original silver color. Not so nice at all is the exact halving of the original excellent user instruction manual to pocket size. The English is as lucid as ever, but now barely readable in half-size font; and the tight binding doesn't keep the book open at a page - a real pain! To be PC, one now gets two pint-size manuals in the box - one English and one Spanish. Fortunately, you can download the full size printing from the Canon website - but couldn't those pdf files have been included in the accompanying CD? Likewise the software manual, disfigured by a \"Copy\" watermark on each page.Don't be fooled by the accessory tele, wide and macro lenses - these require a separate adapter, bringing their cost close to that of an SLR lens. In other words, if 4x zoom doesn't meet your needs, spring for a digital SLR! Overall, not yielding to the 8MP race (which has not reviewed well), the 7MP sensor seems to fare much better in reviews, with the G6 offering the sharpest resolution and minimal color fringing. It will take jerky \"movies\", but if you are at all serious, use a camcorder. This top-rated prosumer camera has SLR-like manual controls; but it needs a much higher quality printed manual to clarify the many features - you'd never figure out that the flash button converts the current image from JPEG  to RAW, for instance.Visible cost-trimming measures such as half-size manuals printed on cheap paper, downsized frame, and skimpy 32MB memory card can only raise concerns about invisible corner cutting of the camera's innards.

Smalheer \"zombieman\"", "ReviewID": "R37LLODID32FEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera for Christmas, and I wanted to wait to write a review, so that I could really use the camera and put it to the test.  I would consider myself an average amateur photographer.  I have taken a few courses on photography, but I am by no means even close to a pro.  I don't really know how to set the proper f-stop and shutter settings for getting the right exposures in certain lighting.This camera blew me away with how many features it has.  There are still things that I haven't been able to play around with, even after three months of owning it.  The \"auto\" setting pretty much takes care of whatever you can throw at it.  I have used \"auto\" in all different light conditions, and with all sorts of different subjects and scenes, and it has never disappointed me.  I almost feel like they don't need any of the manual settings because the \"auto\" does such a great job.  That is not to say, however, that the manual settings can't improve on the \"auto\".  As with any good camera, when you can tweak the settings you will get fantastic pictures.  I personally love the black and white setting, because I think there is something beautiful about a well-composed b&w; photo.  Even when you are in a manual mode the camera will either let you know when a setting isn't right for the shot, or it will automatically correct it.  But enough about the settings, let's get to the pictures.I immediately bought a 512mb CF card, because the camera does not work without a memory card.  The 32mb one that they include is really too small for a 7.1 MP camera.  I have it in my camera bag as an emergency back-up in case I run out of space on my main card.  With the 512mb card, I can get 163 shots in the highest detail setting, which I think is great.  The highest settings can produce photos with massive detail and unbelievable clarity, and you could theoretically print a poster size print and you would love the detail.  One of the complaints that people have about digital cameras is that there is a \"blueing\" on the outer edges of the photos sometimes.  I have yet to experience any significant blueing, whereas I have seen other people with other cameras that have pretty bad blueing.  The zoom is adequate for a  digital camera, but I wish that it could be a little better.  We have a $150 film camera that has much better zoom, and I have no idea why digital cameras can't follow suit.  Anyway, I love every picture that I have taken with this camera, and I find myself going to it over my SLR more and more.  I posted a few photos that I took at a local park near my house called Euclid Creek they day after I got the camera, when I was still just screwing around with it.  I didn't even really know what I was doing, but I think the pics are pretty good.  The pictures I am taking now are so much better.The fold-out LCD screen is great.  It's something that you wouldn't think would be all that different from any other camera, but it truly is a fantastic feature.  I usually fold it out to the side, but you can leave it closed, or flip it around so that it stays on the back of the camera.  Also, when you take a vertically oriented photo, the viewer will automatically flip it so that you can view it along with all the other photos, without having to turn the camera.Lastly, the stitch-assist is a fantastic feature.  My wife and I ski in the rockies, and we love to get panoramic pictures from the peaks.  The camera makes it so easy to get full 360 degree panoramics that you can then blend together on your computer with little trouble.Overall, this camera is fantastic for someone who wants to take great pictures but isn't a pro.  Sure, digital SLRs may have more features, but most people will never use them.  The 7.1 MP resolution, the depth of settings, and the ease of use make this camera a fantastic buy that will be taking oustanding pictures for me for years to come.", "Date": "March 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Annie P.", "ReviewID": "R1I7Z3VSXYVKRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was debating between the Canon Pro 1 and the Canon G6 to replace my Nikon Coolpix.  After much research I decided on the Canon G6.  Although the Pro 1 has a longer zoon it lacks the AF assist beam for shots taken in dark conditions.  I took some shots in complete darkness using the AF assist beam and the pictures turned out great.  The G6 is awesome camera with excellent picture quality--even better than I expected.  The pictures are clear and the colors are vibrant.  The recycling time between pictures is much faster than either of the Nikon Coolpix I own.The G6 has a wide range of features for beginners and more advanced users.  I recommend taking the time to read the users guide to get to know what the G6 is capable of.  For those of who like black and white or sepia pictures--no problem with the G6.  You can record pictures or movies in either.The included Canon software is easy to install and use.  When your G6 is hooked up to your computer you have complete control over camera through the software.  You also get a good amount of accessories included with the G6:  shoulder strap, 32 MB CF card (you will need an additional card), and wireless remote.

One picture on automatic out of the box made me a believer... superb! Flash shots are perfectly exposed edge to edge even in very dim light. And the list of features will take me years to learn, although many are similar to 35mm film boxes. Taking a poor picture with this camera would require either a defective unit or body movement while shooting. The included remote control takes care of hand shake blur.... a winner of a feature. I compared sample pictures on line from this camera, the Pro1, and the Sony DSCV3. Of course, I read all the reviews as well. The pictures from the G6 were the same or slightly better than from the Pro1 and significantly better than the Sony. This camera is a real deal for what you get... recommended without reservation for someone who wants more than a point-and-shoot model, although it does this extremely well.

Many 8-megapixel cameras have had some noise and \"fringing\" issues in trying to cram too many megapixels on such a small sensor, but the G6 is the perfect \"marriage\" between resolution and compactness.  The G6 is very responsive and is fast between shots.Some bells and whistles that I did not plan on using very much but that now I cannot live without are the swivel LCD and the remote.

I'm still learning the technical jargon of photography and it'll probably take a few more months to learn everything this camera can do.It's not going to fit in your pocket, but it will fit in a small camera case you can put on your belt or over your shoulder.  A lot of people scoff at anything that isn't a digital SLR, but their size makes them too cumbersome to carry around if you like to go out in the \"bush\" with you.  With 7.1 megapixels, you will get sharp pictures that can be blown up large enough to put hang on the wall (perhaps 11X17 or larger).  Remember, you won't see much if any difference on a computer screen because the most CRT's resolution is less than 7 megapixels.  It's only when you zoom in that you notice the increased detail.If you're an amateur photographer that wants to learn photography and produce high-quality images, you can get this camera for under $500 bucks.  I suggest at least buying the 58MM adapter for the wide angle lens or telephoto, because you can then buy polarizing filters, which are essential for taking excellent photos on sunny days.  I think that the most overated stat on these types of cameras is the zoom.  It's occaisionally useful to have some zoom capability, but most of the time you want a wide angle shot to show the largest field of vision possible, especially for scenery shots.If you really want 5x optical zoom or more, don't buy this camera, but make sure you get one with image stabilization.I even saw it for sale for $360, but that deal actually sounded too good to be true!

The quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution. The trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag (or big pocket, if it fits). Why? Because Canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90% of the time when you're moving it to or from a bag. To compound this problem, the lens extends (in your bag), pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage. So, if you think of this as a professional camera, to be kept in a real camera-case, you'll probably be okay. If you're somebody, like me, who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket, you're going to be annoyed by the power switch. That said, I do LOVE the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them.CONS: stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still (around 35mm?)PROS: awesome pictures; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens; great battery life; awesome pictures", "Date": "March 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for intermediate photographers", "Author": "Jennifer L.

However, I have had problems with focusing on finer details on objects, or if the object is too close to the camera. The macro mode typically fixes this problem, but difficult lighting scenarios occasionally pose a problem. It has the ability to manually focus and can produce images with incredible depth-of-field, but the auto-focus upon actually shooting occasionally focuses on the wrong objects in the photo. The ability to change the length of exposure is wonderful - up to 15 seconds of exposure.This is a great camera for the mid-range photographer that wants to explore more advanced digital techniques. For advanced photographers who are loyal to the Canon line, I would suggest upgrading to either the 20D or the Digital Rebel.

If your subject is your 2 year old grandson, he moves all the time.  Minus one star.The optical viewfinder only shows about 80% of the image the camera captures, and that varies with the zoom setting.

The G6 is 4.1 x 2.9 x 2.9 inches and 16 ounces, 10% smaller than it's predessor (the G5).There is an excellent LCD display on the Canon Powershot G6: 2.0\" in size, and it tilts, twists, and swivels to almost any position.The 4x optical zoom zoom on the Canon Powershot G6 is more than enough for everyday use.The Canon Powershot G6 accepts standard Compactflash cards, with 512mb Compactflash cards often around $50 these days and 1gb cards coming close to $100 you can get a lot of storage at a good price.Battery life on the Canon Powershot G6 is also improved with a new 10.3 watt-hour version of the Canon BP-511 battery.With the Canon Powershot G6 you would have to work hard to fill up a large memory card or run out of battery power in a day. (battery life is supposed to be 300 shots, in large (3072x2304 pixel) superfine mode you can fit over 300 shots on a 1gb card (and even in the largest RAW storage mode you can fit about 150 shots).A good set of accessories are included in the Canon Powershot G6 box:The 7.1 effective Megapixel Canon PowerShot G6 camera32MB CompactFlash cardBP-511A lithium-ion batteryBattery chargerWireless remote controlLens cap w/retaining strapNeck strapUSB cableA/V cableCD-ROM featuring Canon Digital Camera Solutions, ArcSoft Camera Suite, and driversCamera manual + software manual (both printed)The inclusion of a wireless remote control is a big plus point, combined with a mini-tripod it makes it simple to take wobble-free photos or self portraits with the Canon Powershot G6.The Canon Powershot G6 also has good range of accessories available:0.7x wide angle lens1.75x telephoto lensClose up lensConverter lens adapterLens hoodExternal flashMacro ring lightMacro twin lightAC adapterCar charger cableOverall, the Canon Powershot G6 is an excellent choice for a high quality camera that you can both point and click and fiddle around with nearly all the settings.", "Date": "August 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "Perfect for amature enthusiasts who want a little more control over their Photo", "Author": "Paolo M.

Normally, to focus on a subject one has to aim using the center of the camera, where the focusing point is. but what if you want to put some artistic flare into your photo, and what if you have to subjects that are not aligned? by having the 9 auto focus point spread throughout the viewing area, when you press the shutter half way, the camera instantly focuses on all the subjects. it instantly puts squares over what you have in the frame indicating That it has locked on. it will then adjust the settings and the light to give you the best possible shot.

Only a few cams had great IQ and the best of them was canon's G's, I seem canon made changes after the G6 that many felt was bad ones.I seen the G6 had a very fast f2 to f3 and the lens was slower after the G6, also the G6 was one stop better then canon said it was, this adds up to a great digital even though it's older. Even now it's still a good choice, because of it being a stop faster and having a fast f2 to f3 lens.One thing I worried about was a fast lens does little good, if it's not sharp wide open, and I was glad to see it was very sharp wide open, and only got a little sharp stop down a little. The amount of detail in the photos sold me on it, it can indeed take photos as good as a dSLR can, as long as you do everything right.It has lots of manual settings, and RAW that I always use, the battery is the same as my canon 50D, I got it use but it only had just short of 300 photos taking with it, it's just like new with no problems or marks at all, it's has a 7.1 MP sensor and from what I seen so far, that really is the sweet spot.The amount detail in lower ISO settings is truly great and makes it stand out from others, the last lens will let me take shots as lower ISO's.

I have owned two digital cameras (3 MP and 5 MP, both are Sony) and I was upgrading to 7MP.I narrowed my search to Sony V3 and Canon G6.  I thought G6 may deliver better picture qualify because it has a bigger lens.  I found out in a hard way that in this case, SIZE DOES NOT MATTER!Here is the story:  I bought a G6 about 3 months ago (at $599.99).  I compared it side by side (same objects same conditions) with my 3MP Sony DS75 and astonishingly saw that my three-year-old Sony DS75 beat the G6 both in resolution and color of the pictures.  I was very disappointed and decided to compare the G6 and V3.  I brought my compact flash card to a local chain store that sells both the G6 and V3.  The sales person was kind enough to let me take dozens of picture at the store using my compact flash card in both the G6 and V3.  I compared the pictures at home.  Every single shot (in door) by the V3 was better.What about outdoor pictures? I bought the Sony V3. I took many outdoor pictures using both the G6 and V3.  Again, the V3 outdoor pictures have much better resolution and color.  I was totally convinced that the G6 was just a piece of junk.Another thing for the G6:  It does not have date/time stamp unless you print in out in a Canon printer.  Years from now, I don't want to check the time I create the picture file to figure out when the pictures were taken.  If date/time stamp is important to you, another reason to forget about the G6.I returned the G6 (paid 15% restock fee).  I have taken over a thousand pictures with my V3 and I am very happy with it.  Picture quality is much better with the Sony V3.  Don't be fooled by the size of the Canon lens. If there is a 0 star option for rating, I will give G6 a 0 star.", "Date": "March 25, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "7.1-megapixel PowerShot digital camera with a fast f2.0-3.0, 35-140mm (35mm equivalent) lens in a compact body\nNew ergonomic design includes an enhanced SLR-type grip for better handling and 2.0-inch LCD panel\n9-point AiAF for precise and accurate focusing\n12 EOS-based shooting modes\nPrint directly to Canon photo printers or any PictBridge-compatible printer", "Name": "Canon PowerShot G6 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EVCPXZ1WL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0002OE2P8"}}
