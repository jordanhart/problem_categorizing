I had been looking for a new digital camera for some time, but every one I looked at for under $75 had a lot of negative reviews or very few megapixels. This camera is fantastic!  The LCD screen is a good size for seeing your pictures instantly, and it is a simple point and shoot.  There is a zoom function, and automatic flash.  The 12 megapixels provide very high quality photos.  The best part is how easy it is to get the pictures off the camera.  It comes with a USB cord that connects directly to a any computer with a USB port.  I just plug it in, and Windows opens me a folder from the camera.  Easy peasy!  I usually use the \"cut\" function to remove the pictures to my desktop so my camera doesn't fill up, but it is easy to delete right from the camera as well.  The battery life is okay, and on par with most small electronics I think.  However, I don't use the camera as much as others might.Overall, a wonderful camera at a great price.  Highly recommended!", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "i wanted the old model as it works on my ZIP-SPIN then this one you need a PC to burn a DVD.
