{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally, a \"full service\" waterproof camera for all those fun-filled vacations, let the kids go crazy!", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "RBHUKK67UMJWD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So many of our family's vacations are at beaches, lakes, water-parks, or hikes and bringing along the sensitive digital camera has always been a problem. If I carried it then I could not get in water and I spent more time worrying whether the sand would damage it than taking pics of my family. I lost a camera on a Disney Park fun ride when water suddenly splashed into the ride and we were miserable for losing all our pics. With this camera you can drop it in water and not worry about your pics unless you lose the camera (happened to me another time when I fell overboard and dropped a camera in the open sea). I have other cameras that I have been too lazy to review but I am excited about this one so I sat down to write this review.This is like a regular Canon Camera with all the features and the added waterproof feature. It can be compared to the new SD780 IS which sells for fifty bucks less. The features are similar, except that this one is waterproof and bulkier and does not have a viewfinder (not that you can see much through a fogged up viewfinder in humid conditions).Some great features:- Good looking waterproof camera, \"cuteness\" is very important, I disliked those clear cases that you have to screw on your camera and as one reviewer reported they can still get fogged up- Rainproof/Waterproof up to 33 ft, good for most pools or waterparks- Freeze proof lens up to 14 deg F- SMART Auto mode that detects the right scene mode for each shot (works great)- Digic 4 processor, auto shots are nicer than some older Canon cameras, optical image stabilization and motion detection to prevent blurring of images- 2.5 inch extra bright LCD that's covered by a protective surface to prevent scratches and looks good in bright sun- 3X optical and 12X digital zoom- Face detection- \"Blink\" detection - the camera gives a blink warning if someone's eyes are closed in the picture- Contrast correction - Can be set while taking picture or even afterward to correct darker areas- Continuous shooting lets you capture the perfect water shot- Scene modes - The auto mode does a good job of sensing the conditions but if you want to set a mode you get the choice of - Night exposure, Panorama (stitch together shots in one), programmable mode, portrait, sunset, beach, fireworks, aquarium, underwater, snow, indoor, kids and pets, foliage, long shutter, color accent (keep only one color in a pic, so the water and jeans will be blue while the people black and white) and color swap (change one color to another, swap the color of your boat from beige to red).Negatives:- Slightly bulkier than your typical Canon SD, it's built for water, beach and rugged use, and it's rounder shape with no hard edges can take a fall or two- No threads for filters- No RAW mode- No lens cap but the glass shield is scratchproofThe back panel is pretty intuitive and you probably won't need the manual to figure it out. The buttons have been designed for waterproof operations and the zoom in and out is done through buttons on the back of the camera rather than with the shutter button lever like with other Canon cameras. The photo and video mode is toggled through a round button next to the shutter button.The best thing about this camera? You can give it to your 6 year old to take underwater pics and not worry about it, how many other \"real\" cameras can you do that with?! Now I can float down that lazy river at the water park with my family and take some nice shots rather than running along the edge trying to capture the perfect moment. And the best thing is that this camera works just as well on land. It's the perfect no-nonsense take along everywhere (really every where!) vacation camera.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great waterproof camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R22DPPKDCL17MT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been playing with my new Powershot D10 for about a week and really like it. I have been using Canon SLRs for 25+ years, AE1 Program, A1, Elan 7e, and Digital Rebel. When I started looking for a waterproof camera to take snorkeling, my first choice was Canon, based on my many years of satisfaction with their products, and I was very lucky that this camera was released two weeks before leaving for vacation. (Amazon had been showing the camera as available for pre-order until earlier today. I purchased mine from a local camera store.)I'm very impressed with the picture quality on this camera. The 12 megapixel sensor, coupled with a dozen shooting modes, produce an excellent image. I'm used to controlling aperture and shutter speed on the SLR, so simply selecting \"portrait\" or \"night exposure\" mode and letting the camera do all the work just seems too easy. Or, if selecting \"portrait\" is too difficult, you can select \"auto\" and just let the camera do it all. Movie quality is also quite good. The LCD screen on the back of the camera seems huge compared to the 1\" screen on my old Digital Rebel. It's a great display.The controls are conveniently arranged, and easy to use, and the associated icons displayed are both informative and intuitive. You can choose to display all the settings or turn them off and just see the image. One of the useful display options is a grid overlay on the screen to assist with shot composition and the \"Rule of Thirds.\" The optical zoom works great. By the time you get to 12x with the digital zoom, the image is kind of grainy, but that's to be expected.You can take macro photographs an inch or two from your subject. I've had trouble focusing my Digital Rebel in the dark, but Canon seems to have improved low-light focusing quite a bit. It has a manual focus feature that indicates the distance to the subject as you adjust the focus, just in case it can't get the focus right.I like the Panorama feature, which displays the previous shot on the viewfinder while you're composing the next shot, allowing the photographer to closely match subsequent shots, resulting in panoramic photos with less distortion when they're stitched together. Panorama mode also locks in the exposure value of the first shot so that the exposure in subsequent shots all match the first shot.The face recognition and blink detection both seem to work well. As the camera focuses, it will zoom in on one of the faces so the photographer can verify correct focus. After the shot is taken, if someone blinked it will identify the face of the person blinking so you can take another shot. These can be turned on or off according to user preference. Images seem very crisp, which I attribute to the image stabilization features, which can also be turned on or off.I've had the camera in the sink, and it handles six inches of water with no problems. I'll see how it does with thirty two and a half more feet of water when it meets the Atlantic Ocean in a few weeks! The wrist strap attaches to any one of the four corners of the camera (convenient for carrying in either left or right hand) and seems to be pretty secure, so no worries about losing it if you get knocked over by a wave.I use Photoshop Elements, so I haven't loaded the Canon software and can't comment on that. And since I edit photos on the computer, I doubt that I'll use some of the in-camera editing features, such as black and white, sepia, color swap, and the various color enhancements. I could see that would be useful to those who print directly from the camera, without editing on a computer.The camera doesn't allow you to shoot in RAW. I generally don't shoot in RAW with my SLR, so that doesn't worry me. It has a number of white balance modes, custom white balance, and auto white balance. It seems to do a good job selecting the correct shooting conditions in auto mode. Colors appear correct.A couple of drawbacks: The camera isn't threaded so you're not able to attach filters. There's also no lens cap, and I worry about the lens surface getting damaged. For a rugged \"adventure\" camera, I'm also surprised that there's no GPS chip so that photos can be tagged with the exact location. I look at old slides taken while I was hiking and think \"that's neat, why can't I remember where I took that.\" It would be nice if the EXIF data included lattitude and longitude. (Watch Canon come out with the Powershot D10 \"Gold\" six months from now that incorporates these features. The curse of being an early adopter.)The microphone picks up every movement your fingers make as you hold the camera, so it's difficult to capture movies without some camera noise. The speaker on the bottom of the camera is also difficult to hear when playing movies back on the camera, but movies sounds fine when I pop the memory chip into the computer and watch in Quicktime. Movies are produced in the .mov format, so you'll have to do some conversion if you want to do anything with it in Windows Movie Maker. You can also choose between higher quality 640 x 480, or lower quality 320 x 240. (I should post a video review, but look like a dork in movies, so I'll spare everybody that.)Tried to take a few infrared photos, but the image has the Hot Spot typical of many Canon cameras and lenses. I held a Hoya R72 filter over the lens and took several shots. Bright sunlight is about a 4\" exposure, and all shots have a bluish circle in the center.The drawbacks are very minor compared to the great images this camera produces.I'm very impressed with this camera. It feels very sturdy, takes great photos, and seems very easy to use. Although I'll probably continue to use my Digital Rebel as my primary camera, I certainly look forward to many years of fun with this camera.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a couple of inconveniences", "Author": "I. Gulko", "ReviewID": "R3PBV60MJDF6PC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great, quick camera that focuses fast and takes good pictures. The interface is well thought out; For example, half-pressing the shutter button always takes you straight into camera mode.It's perfect for wet environments, like swimming, rafting, etc. Most of this has already been covered in other reviews, so I'll just post my biggest complaints, followed by a few tips for new owners.Complaints:1) The camera is very thick, much thicker than I thought based on the pictures. It is almost as thick as a credit card is tall! Forget fitting it into a pocket comfortably. Basically, this camera is as thick as a regular 3X zoom PowerShot with its lens fully extended.2) Expensive, overpriced accessories. I like the strap being attachable at any of the four corners, and this has actually come in useful. I think a neck strap would be even more useful, but Canon expects me to pay $100-130 for a dingy kit (AKT-DC1) of a few straps and colored shell replacements!? No thanks!3) This is standard for Canon cameras, but it's still a major annoyance. The camera cannot be used as a USB drive when attached to a computer. I don't even understand what purpose the USB port is even supposed to serve. In short: if you forgot to bring your card reader, you're SOL.Tips:1) Clock: You can check the current time by holding down the Func/Set button in either review or camera modes. Tilt the camera vertically to see the date too.2) Review pictures faster by turning off the fading transition between pictures. This is all the way at the bottom of the first menu in review mode.3) Put the mostly useless Print button to work: The \"Set Print button\" setting under the first menu in camera mode (all the way at the bottom.) If you set it to \"Rec. movie\", you can start recording a video with just one button press instead of having to switch modes back and forth.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Water leaked in", "Author": "Roy Messer", "ReviewID": "RBPZKIJSIO5RA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was disappointed in the fact that the camera does not have a setting for action shots. Used it for first time in Hawaii as I stood in the surf and took photos of son standing on boogie board. Generally the photos for other circumstances are good.Really disappointed when I used the camera in just two feet of water, just to take a photo of my son ducking his head under the water. The next day the camera was kaput, with the viewing screen obviously damaged by water. The areas inside the battery compartment and USB port appeared to be dry, so the water apparently came in elsewhere. Leaving these camera doors open dried out the screen, and the camera would turn on but work no further than that.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "leaked, no warranty", "Author": "Kerstin Sommer", "ReviewID": "R1Z2IDF8BLA5A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera leaked the fourth time I took it in the water. I brought it back to the store as it was only a few month old. Canon refused to replace the camera saying the battery compartment must have been open or I must have taken it beyond 10m water depth. The battery compartment was closed and it was a swimmingpool!  I am very disappointed as I have almost no pictures from my very first trip to Australia. I definitly don't recommend this camera!", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great underwater AND general purpose camera", "Author": "Rodrigo Diaz Espinoza \"entropythecus\"", "ReviewID": "R3VK6ZQQBLB53R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip to St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. I originally acquired it to take underwater pictures, since I own a nikon D40 with a 18-200 mm lens for \"landscape\" type of pictures, but I got very surprised with its quality as a \"general purpose\" camera. It takes very balanced pictures and the settings are very flexible. Whenever I went to the beach, I preferred to take the D10 instead of the bulky SLR, and it worked flawless.But it is underwater where the camera shined. I took hundreds of pictures of corals and fishes, and the quality of most of them was excellent (considering this is camera fits in your hand and it is very lightweight). I also recorded many underwater videos, which is done very nicely by the camera as well. The incorporated microphone is rather low quality, but it kind of make sense to me to avoid water intrusion I guess. I used the camera for at least 8 hours total under seawater during my 4-day trip and I did not have problems at all. I soaked it in tap water everytime I used it in the sea as stated in the manual. This camera really changed my trip. My girlfriend is actually thinking about getting another for herself since we had to share it when snorkeling.The camera is fast. Whenever I saw a nice fish around me, I turned it on and took a picture in a matter of 2-3 seconds. Most images were not blurry, which kind of surprised me. With the appropiate light (as it happens with every kind of camera), underwater pictuers can get very very nice. The LCD is very clear underwater, and it gives you a fair idea about the picturejust taken. Flash did not work well underwater since there was a lot of reflection, so it is better to disable it and use it with proper light. I'll be uploading pictures soon.I'd recommend this camera to anyone needing an all-weather camera for amateur purposes. Although i've had it for three weeks, it seems very reliable. It is made in Japan, which i guess gives it an extra bonus IMO.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Works as advertised", "Author": "Karyn", "ReviewID": "R3D6UVPNMD5BUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just returned from Hawaii and the Canon D10 withstood two weeks of underwater (ocean and fresh water) and outdoor (rain and waterfall) excursions.  I had my doubts but the camera worked like a champ.  On the last day (after loading all of the photos onto my computer) I decided to tempt fate and took the camera down to around 25-30ft deep and tried a couple of shots just to see how it held-up at close to the advertised depth.  To further tempt fate, I tried to make a point of manipulating all of the controls while I was down there.  The shots came out great and the camera survived unscathed.  I do have two suggestions though.  Periodically wipe-off the protective lens cover because the camera can have a tendancy to autofocus on the tiny particles of ocean detritus that stick to the lens cover (and take multiple shots because you often can't tell that a shot is out of focus by quickly glancing at the view screen while you're under water).  My other suggestion is to buy a high-vis floating strap (like the Olympus).  While the camera floats by itself, if you decide to stuff it into your pocket while you're swimming around it can slip-out.  While doing my family head-count out past the reef, I noticed an orange object floating in the water about 80ft away.  Without the high vis strap, I would have almost certainly lost the camera.  All-in-all, I was pleased with the D10's underwater performance and durability, and it also takes excellent scenery shots (I've posted a couple of examples).  In all other ways, it's basically a standard Canon compact camera (but with better than average low-light performance).", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good to Great -  One suggested item", "Author": "Humble Opinion \"Dan\"", "ReviewID": "R2E64BTNR8TSTZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the picture quality, construction, and the portability of the Canon PowerShot D10. I have always wanted a camera to take pictures while in and around water. My only suggestion is to add a view finder. It is difficult to frame a picture in the LCD viewfinder. The video function also worked well.Extreme care should be used when inspecting the seals around the compartment doors. If you forget to shut a compartment door; or sand, dirt, debris is around the seal -- the camera will leak. This is not a design flaw, but an issue that needs attention every time one uses the camera in water.I would not be surprised if the seals would periodically need replacement.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Leaked after first use...", "Author": "M.

I am a diehard Canon fan, and was initially thrilled with this camera.  I used it underwater while snorkeling, on the beach shooting waves, on dry land, and then that was it.  It stopped working the third time I took it in the water.  Each time I took the camera out of the water, I followed the instructions carefully, soaking it in fresh water, and then making sure that it was completely dry before opening the battery/memory card compartment and the USB compartment.  After the camera stopped working, the two compartments were dry, which leads me to believe that water leaked in elsewhere.  I can see water on the inside lens, and fogging on the LCD screen.  I am very disappointed as I would have liked to use this camera during the last few days of my vacation.  Thank goodness I have another camera with me, although I won't be able to take any more photos in the water!  I rated this item with one star as it should have lasted much longer than 4 days.  I'll update this after I see how Canon responds and how the camera works after it has been replaced/repaired.  By the way, amazon.com was great - I received the camera when promised.

When I contacted Canon Canada by email to ask if they would repair my camera under warranty, they gave me a wishy washy answer.

This camera took great land and water photos. I used a lot of the different scenery settings, which was great. The foliage pictures turned out great. The only disappointment I had was when I found a green gecko on a red plant (how awesome of a contrast is that), the details were great, but the plant looked more orange than red in my photo. Landscape mode was good for Iao Needle and Hana.Underwater pictures were great and the water wasn't too choppy on the surface. We went to Honolua Bay and the colors of the fish and coral were vibrant underwater. It was amazing, some pictures you could not even tell you were underwater. You have to get under the water and face the camera up to get nicer pictures and even though the fish were swimming, you can still capture the clear picture. The battery life for the camera is awesome! My friend had another Canon camera with the underwater case, his battery died after a few hours. My battery was still strong and I had the camera on the whole time as you never know when that cool fish will swim by.We next went to the Ka'anapali Beach outside of the hotel and unfortunately the surf was a bit rougher. However, there were turtles near the beach near Black Rock and I had the underwater setting so I took both pictures outside the water and in the water. The surf was kicking up a lot of sand, so it was hard to get a clear picture of the turtle under the water. I was getting knocked over by the waves and I'm sure my camera was hitting the sand a bit as was I, but it had no problems at all.One of my favorite pictures was using the Sunset scenery setting. The sunset was bright orange and the details of the pictures turned out great. When you look on the LCD screen, it looked a bit off, but after you took the picture, it was just magnificent. The color quality was a vibrant orange and you can see the reflection on the water and detail was just great.This is a great all around camera for land or water. It's easy to use once you read the manual and it's a Canon (need I say more). It's a recognized camera as it's bright blue and I love the large LCD screen. It really helps when your underwater taking pictures.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome piece of Engineering", "Author": "Jim Jose", "ReviewID": "R3QTSQR0TN4ZI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was about to leave for a vacation to the Virgin islands and wanted a camera that I could carry around without worrying about salt, water or salt water. If possible, I wanted something that I could take into the water with me.Came across this gem while searching for a waterproof enclosure for my existing canon super zoom. Since the price was comparable to an enclosure and after reading reviews, I decided that getting this camera was probably a better option.When I finally bought it, I had my fingers crossed (cause of the reviews which indicated water getting into it). I decided this camera would be great, even if it lasted only a day of snorkeling, otherwise I still had my old camera (which I would lose if water got into the enclosure).I was surprised at the actual results. The camera does an awesome job both inside and outside water. The underwater shots are simply superb. It becomes noisy at >= ISO 400, but this shouldn't affect your underwater shots (which I noticed were almost all at ISO 80 - the lowest for this camera).I took about 200 test shots (all outside water) before the trip, to get used to the camera and thereby put it through a full drain and charge cycle. The camera has a rated spec of about 220 shots per full charge. Well my results from 3 continuous days of use (with a full recharge in-between) were 640, 700+ and 750+ shots! Most of them were underwater (without a flash) and a few used the flash. All of them were at 12 MP. I used a Transcend 8 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6 for this trip. The camera lasted the trip - all the water, surf and beaches.If you decide to get this camera.. here are a few tips:1. Put it through a charge discharge cycle before taking it for a real shoot. The way I discharged it was by taking test shots.2. Switch off the camera while not using it (every second saves the battery power - that's probably how I squeezed out 700 shots). It only takes a second to power up and be ready for shooting.3. Unless absolutely required don't preview the photos - take another snap if you have a doubt. This will definitely save battery power. Your battery will run out long before an 8 GB memory card runs out of space.4. The manual asks you to soak it for 30 mins in fresh water after each underwater session. Do this! What it doesn't tell you is to detach the wristband and to soak it separately. The wristband takes a little longer to dry - and if still attached, can splash water when you you open your camera's SD/battery slot. Soak it for a full 30 mins. Wipe it dry and then allow it to dry in air. The good thing is that you can continue snapping new pictures while it is drying. Just don't open it until say after an hour of drying in air.5. Secure the wristband while in water. Keep in-water camera transfers (to another person) to a minimum, it can easily slip off and sink. You can dive and retrieve it - but it may sink beyond 10m before that or probably end up on a fire coral :-).6. You can take snaps of the beach while in water - but make sure you switch from the underwater mode to any other mode before doing that (eg.beach mode). If you just surfaced, allow the camera a few seconds for it to 'realize' that it's not underwater (guess there is some white balance and exposure adjustment that automatically happens) and you'll end up with a great snap.7. When you just surface, there will be drops of water on the lens. Get rid of those (by dipping it again in water and not using your fingers!) before snapping - or you'll end up having blurry spots on those snaps. You'll always have droplets, that shouldn't matter - it's only the big drops which cause these blurry spots (you'll know if its bad enough while composing the snap on the display).8. Finally make sure the camera is in underwater mode while shooting underwater :-)Read the manual, clean and dry the camera before opening it. It worked for me and it should work for you. Happy shooting! You will love the underwater snaps!!!**** UPDATE - Got this error:- \"Lens error restart camera\" and fixed it *****Got this error about a month after using it for the first time. I think I know how I got the error - I drained all the juice out of the battery while taking snaps and it probably died before it could close the lens. The solution - turn the camera on and quickly give the lens housing a firm snap with your finger - that should fix it :-). It's better not to take snaps once you get a Low Battery indication. Replace the battery and continue shooting else you may end up with the Lens stuck in between.This is still a great camera and I would still buy it given it's the best among the options currently available.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not a waterproof camera!!", "Author": "Charlene A.

Axon", "ReviewID": "R11W9M4SXJ22RN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wish I didn't have to write a negative review about this camera. As a die-hard Canon fan with 3 EOS digital SLRs and numerous L lenses in his case, I was initially confident that the D10 would be a significant step-up from my prior underwater system comprising a rock-solid Powershot S45 and Canon underwater-case. I was looking for a less bulky alternative, and the D10 appeared to suit the bill.I love the ease-of-use camera software that Canon has left alone in its various iterations of Powershot series, and the online reviews of this D10 put it at the top-of-the-pack in numerous tests versus other current manufacturer competitors.I've had the camera for just two months, and up until recently it's given pretty good pictures. Even underwater, when using the underwater white-balance setting, and with a little post-processing, the pictures turn out good. The flash throws pretty well underwater, and I've seen no sign of water entry - the seals seem to be well designed. The resolution should give some decent sized prints - I typically print out 17\"x22\" prints at home from my SLRs.Ok, so last week when reviewing some pictures, the camera suddenly fails to start-up, with a warning on the LCD screen saying \"Lens Error - restart camera\"; a couple of beeps and flashes from the green LED and off it turns. I check it with several freshly-charged batteries and no luck. I put in a new SD card, as if that'll help, but no difference. The problem is with the camera.I've now searched online for this error message, and it appears I'm not alone with this problem. Several people are thinking it's a design flaw with the D10.And ironically, last night, the camera suddenly started working again. But then today it's stopped again. So now I've got something worse than a faulty camera - I've got a sporadically faulty camera.As I say, if you do buy this camera, just ensure you keep the receipt and all the packaging - you may have to avail yourself of the limited warranty, as I'm going to have to do, today. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you have a reliable model and if so, you'll have a super little camera.Update (Nov 10, 2009):Camera is currently with Canon. The service department so far has been very good and courteous. They have agreed that it is a warranty-worthy repair and that it should take 7-10 business days to complete. I'll provide an update upon completion of this.Update (Feb 18, 2010):Canon repaired the D10 in Nov 2009. Waited until now to update. I'm happy to say that I've had no issue with the camera since then. It has performed very well, and no apparent recurrence of the lens error. I'm hoping it'll remain this way, and that my confidence in Canon, albeit briefly dented, is slowly on the mend. Indeed, I'm about to buy the 24-70mm f2.8 L lens! (not for this camera...).Bumped up my rating from 2* to 3*. Would like to give the camera more, but having no RAW facility, or a wide-angle lens, and the lack of zoom when videoing still puts this camera at a disadvantage to others including within Canon's range. Who wouldn't love to zoom in when videoing underwater, or have wide-angle capability?", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Quick review after owning it for 3 months", "Author": "Wafin", "ReviewID": "R2M4Z23RD4W9LG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here is a quick review from an average user about this camera.I got it for a family vacation in Michigan by Lake Walloon and it performed great.  I also live by the beach and go swimming with my girls in the ocean.  To say the least, we are a bit rough with this camera.I think I'll just share my concerns vs the good things because all the good things are true about.  Takes great pictures, menus are similar to other canon cameras, etc.  The video is way better then my sanyo Xacti CG10 but doesn't have the zoom that the xacti has.So here are my concerns:1.  No lens cap.  Yeah, I tend to grab the camera and by default my left fingers always want to grab around the bulb lens and thus fingerprints tend to be smudged onto lens by occassion.  Could be that I'm left handed but even taking it out of a pouch on my right hip with my right hand, I still tend to always touch the lens.2.  Remember when you go in and out of water, to check the lens for water droplets.  Have a few pictures where it all looked good on the viewer but when I got home and checked on computer, it was out of focus due to water being on the lens.  Ah well...now I'm much more careful.  And this isn't a negative per se, but more of a warning to other fathers.3.  Wish it had come with a camera case and a few of the other lanyards but I guess I could spend another $100 for the accessories.4.  When holding it with the right hand wish it was easier to grip it.  The rubbery texture on the outside works at keeping your fingers on the camera but it would be better to have some type of grove or bump to hold the camera one handed when getting tossed by the waves.  As it is, with the curved shape of the body it wants to shoot out of your hand like a web bar of soap.  Always keep the wrist strap attached to your body.5.  Speaking of wrist strap, why not include a bouyant wrist strap...or at least attempt to make the camera float a bit.  Yeah, not a big thing but seeing that it sinks like a rock if dropped in water, this would be a nice addition.  Again you can buy a floating wrist strap but again, it's an extra cost.6.  Why not have some type of raised bumps around the viewscreen on the back of the camera to protect the viewscreen from getting scratched. If you read the directions, you aren't suppose to lay down the camera on the front or back due to scratching the lenses.  So standing it on it's bottom is the only real option. But here's the problem.  The camera is off weight due to the front bulb of the lense. So any slight bump to the table, rocking of the boat, etc and the camera leans forward and falls on the front part of the camera.  Right where the lens is.  So yeah, I can always put it in the pouch but when your child is crying for your attention you tend to just want to set the camera down fast.7.  Finally, it really isn't pocket friendly but it sure is darn cute and I get a lot of questions about it...so there you go.Ok, so I may sound very negative about the camera but I really love it.  I have a sealife ecoshot underwater camera that I got a year ago and now I only use this canon camera whenever I go to the beach.  This is mainly because it's got a brighter viewscreen, optical zoom and the controls are easier for me to quickly change between settings.The waterproofing seals on both of the cameras seem pretty good.  No worries from me about water leaking into the camera.I'd highly recommend the camera, just know that I have some quirks with it but I like it much better then the other offerings out there.Hope this helps!Matthew", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Filled with water", "Author": "RLF \"RLF\"", "ReviewID": "R1HOBQ2GGZXXDL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My husband and I purchased this camera to take on vacation in Hawaii.

I know there are many cameras available that will take better pictures. I didn't want the bulk of a DSLR, so I considered the Canon G10 or the new Canon SX1 IS.

For this reason I am a big fan of Nokia cell phones because I always have a decent camera with me. As long as the image quality is acceptable, it is more important that you have the camera on your person then anything. While a good cell camera is great, because you always have your phone with you, the Canon D10 takes this a step further. With the D10 you need not worry about the camera getting damaged, so you can take it anywhere and I mean anywhere. It is the ultimate adventure camera, as it is waterproof, shockproof, freeze proof and well just all around life proof. If you have an active life and you want pictures of it, then this is the camera for you. A camera for an active life. The photo quality while not the best in the world is more then adequate, the camera is fast and it is easy to use. If you need the best pictures then get a DSLR, if you want a camera that is ready to take pictures any time and any place get the Canon D10. I also recommend a cell phone with a decent camera, as you will always have your phone.(except in the water, snow, etc.... where the D10 is perfect)This camera is nearly perfect though I could see a few improvements for the next version.HD zoom video with auto focus and a GPS receiver for geotagging would put this camera over the top.My only complaints are that the shutter button needs to be pushed in about a millimeter to far for the focus detent and picture. I also wish the optional AC adapter could charge the battery in the camera, as I do not like taking the battery out to charge it.(Afraid I am gonna break a nail or the waterproof door which is hard to get open and for good reason) Canon might consider making the battery a higher capacity built in battery like Apple has done with the macbooks, then have just one door to access the SD card, usb, charging port.This camera takes phenomenal photos under ANY circumstance and has no glaring flaws. If you have an active life style and need a camera that can keep up, look no further.*update*OK I have an update, this camera is great!I was at the Waipio Valley beech in Hawaii when this camera really got put to the test. My buddy lost the camera in the surf!(why he was not wearing the wrist band, I don't know!?!?) The camera spent 10 minutes underwater in the big waves pounding against rocks and sand on the beech. Our entire group of friends rushed into the water to look for it and amazingly we found it! It has been beat up and scratched pretty good,  but still works great.

During a recent vacation to the beach, the D10 exceeded my expectations. I had previously used an Olympus waterproof camera and was disappointed with its usability and image quality. I had no such qualms with the D10.The image quality on the D10 is excellent, especially when used during the magic light hours after sunrise and before sunset. Even during the middle of the afternoon with harsh sunlight, I was able to get acceptable images. Like most point and shoots, the D10 does struggle indoors in low-light.The focusing system is quick and usually put the focus in the right location. The close focus is excellent and allowed me to get close-ups I couldn't get with my DSLR (as I don't have a macro lens yet). The OPTICAL image stabilization system really helped steady my shots while hunched down in the sand.One of the frustrations I had had with my Olympus was my difficulty seeing the screen in the bright sun with my sunglasses on or when I was underwater. In the same situations, the D10 had no such frustrations. I was able to see the screen in landscape and portrait orientations, even with polarized sunglasses on.The startup on the camera is pretty quick (not as quick as a DSLR, but great for a P&S;). Menu layouts are very easy to read and navigate. I went most of the week before I had to charge the battery.Some things I don't like:(1) size - the D10 is larger/more bulbous than most point and shoots; cargo pockets did fine, but otherwise this is no pocket camera.(2) manual control - perhaps not practical on a P&S; like this, but I would like it none-the-less(3) RAW - another pipe dream(4) High ISO ability - I wouldn't take the camera over 400 ISO unless you really, really needed to get the shotOverall in all, this is a great P&S; camera that happens to be waterproof and shockproof.

The truth is, it has failed to live up to its expectations.  There are several problems with this camera, and a couple of them are serious issues.Cons:The biggest problem with this camera - it films video in .mov format.  Which does not work with windows movie maker.  So you either have to buy some video conversion software, or buy a new video editor.  I called canon tech support and they said some software was included with the camera that can convert or edit the video.  The problem is, the software crashes all the time.  The software is so unstable its not usable - I am running windows XP service pack 2.  I had to buy an after market program to convert the .MOV videos to .AVI so they can be edited in windows movie maker.The very least canon could have done, is to test the software before they shipped it.  As soon as the included program starts to edit or convert the .MOV video, the program locks up or crashes.At 12 megapixel the pictures have a lot of noise in them.  Its like they are grainy for some reason.  The 12 megapixel pictures were bad enough that I set the camera to 8 megapixel - and those look better then the 12 megapixel.The pictures are too bright - the automatic setting is nice, but the pictures come out too bight and do not look natural.  In low light - instead of the camera switching to the flash, it adjust the  brightness and makes the picture look strange.The metal snap of the wrist band causes a lot of noise in the video.  While you are filming a video, and moving around, the mic picks up the \"tap, tap, tap\" of the wrist band snap moving around.No second hole in the base for a tri-pod.  Which is not a big deal.No cover for the lens.  So when you take this camera to the beach, you better be careful around sand.  If you get sand on the lens and whip it off, there is a chance you will scratch the lens.Uses lithium battery instead of AA.  For an outdoor camera, AA batteries would have been a better option then a lithium battery.Pros:Its water proof, it takes pictures, and films video.Once the .MOV videos are converted to .AVI, they look really good.", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Solid Canon - With One Fatal Flaw", "Author": "JW", "ReviewID": "R2CVMXV8X07LS4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Have owned for 3 months. Solid Canon with usual benefits - easy to use,fast and 'smart' - facial recognition and auto scene selection really do work.12 M chip allows for lots of digital zooming but often is soft at max - likely due to limits of lens in compact camera and aperature speed of shot. Not a problem however if you stay (as you should) within optical zoom range.My previous Powershot was the IXUS 430 (4MB) which had a tremendous dynamic range and auto color balance management - especially in overcast. This D10 with its 12M chip has a very narrow dynamic range and now goes grey in tone with outdoor overcast shots - perhaps an artifact of 12MB in such a small chip. Anyway, even if these two characteristics are not as good as in the past - they are a complaint I find in all my other compact digital cameras. White balance can be managed by using the custom feature and the dynamic range - well, just pretend you are shooting slide film.The biggest (and perhaps crucial) fault is I have found that the camera occassionally exhibits an error; \"Lens Error - Restart Camera\" when starting up the camera. Esentially the lens does not extend and you must take out and re-insert the battery in order to start camera - not a good thing on the beach or while snorkeling. Do a websearch and this error can be confirmed as a problem Canon has had in past. Perhaps Canon's claim of \"Shockproof\" is a marketing gimic and not supported by any new technology - rather the camera is the same as other Powershots - simply put inside a heavy body.If you are a 'Canon Guy' then go ahead and get it - could be mine is a lemon.

However, it met its demise at a bachelor party while driving a boat on lake.  Long story short, the boat was not going fast enough, the wake was too great, and the boat began to sink and water flooded the front of the boat where my backpack was sitting.  A zip lock bag MAY have saved my camera (but who does this?), but others had said on Amazon that this Olympus was no where close to weatherproof like it's predecessors.  The Olympus was ruined, and a new search was initiated the very next day.THE SEARCHI would feel much better with a new camera that could withstand small accidents AND potentially water based activities.  I usually go to boat parties, float the river, and occasionally DJ pool parties so water is a part of my lifestyle.  Even at bars/clubs, taking pictures around inebriated people can often involve spillage around my camera.  There were only a few cameras that could offer me peace of mind.I narrowed it down to the Fuji WP Z33, Olympus 6000/8000 Stylus Tough Series, and the new Canon D10 (blue submarine).  The Fuji was nice, took great pics outdoors, was water proof to 3M BUT had a lot of noise when taking pics indoors.  Score: Average  The Stylus took absolutely horrible pics whether it was indoors or outdoors.  Score:  Poor  The Canon both took excellent pics indoors and outdoors and also was built like a tank.  Score: Above Average  Of the three, the Canon was an obvious choice.OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDERThe Canon is new so it will be pricy ($300+).  Also, because it is built like a tank, it is bulky and will feel like a tank in your jeans and khakis.  It feels most comfortable when wearing shorts with large pockets.  Last but not least, it's difficult to hold due to it's slippery rounded design, and when you attach the wrist cord...it's even MORE bulky.  Oh yes...only 3x optical zoom...although this is typical of a waterproof camera.CONCLUSIONIf you are okay with size and price tag, then this camera is an exceptional option.  And the best part is you can wash it off in the sink (or sink the boat like I did) and it'll perform as if you bought it yesterday.Good luck to all with their camera searches...

I've owned other Canon digital cameras and have been pleased with the results.  They are not exactly point and shoot (though in AUTO mode you can do that), but there is also great flexibility in user settings.  Getting to manual mode is a bit tricky at first and I haven't used it much in that way, but it is certainly available.  In short, it works like most other Canon digital cameras I have owned, including the ability to stitch photos together for panoramas using the software included.Here are some pros and cons of this particular camera (most of which have been pointed out by previous reviewers):Pros:1.  Takes great pictures.  Megapixel count is high, optical zoom works great up to 3x, red eye correction, autofocus and flash work as they should.  Colors are spot on.2.  It really is waterproof!  I used it to take pictures up to a depth of about 3 meters with no problems and had it submerged for up to an hour at a time with no issues.  This to me is the greatest attribute of this camera.  I may never own another non-waterproof camera again.  What's the point?Cons:1.  Shouldn't a waterproof camera float?!  The wrist strap is very secure, but if you accidently drop the camera, it'll sink straight to the bottom of whatever body of water you're in.  The metal body is nice and makes the camera very durable/attractive, but it seems like a hard plastic body and a few vacuum pockets would do the trick.2.  No lens cover.  A little disconcerting.  I ended up with a smudge on a few of my pictures because I'm not as meticulous about cleaning the lens before every shot as I should be.3.  Videos in .MOV format.  Yuck.  We're not all Mac users.... A very difficult format to transfer out of, too (for free).  I use a program called \"Super\" which will transfer from/to just about anything.4.  The continuous shutter function is very slow.  This is a criticism of all digital cameras I've had (all Canons) and it's no different here.  You can almost press and release the shutter as fast as it will take pictures when you hold down the shutter button.

I was particularly concerned about the on-line reviews that mentioned camera leakage with the Canon, and was diligent about securing any openings and following the proper steps for cleaning after salt water exposure.  The camera behaved beautifully for the first two days; picture quality underwater was superior to the Olympus camera, and I found navigating the settings much easier with the Canon camera than the Olympus.

The leakage happened at multiple sites, not only ruining the battery and LCD display, but also my memory card.  Since I didn't have a backup camera, I wasn't able to take any more photos for the entire vacation, and the ones taken previously were also lost due to memory card corruption.

After doing hours of research on all the different underwater cameras on the market in 2010, I had narrowed it down to the Canon D10 and the Panasonic Lumix TS1. I bought both of these cameras to take on a 2 week vacation to Maui. I wanted to have 2 underwater cameras so that my girlfriend and I would both be able to take snorkeling pictures without having to pass a camera back and forth. Also, I wanted to field test both cameras side by side to find out for myself which camera would be the keeper.The Canon D10 wins out for a few reasons.Main reason -I bought these cameras mainly to take underwater snorkel pictures. When I started using the cameras for regular shots after spending time in the water, intermittent fogging effected both cameras. Here's the difference: The fogging on the D10 only took place on the LCD screen which did not effect the images. I could still see the shots and it was only a minor issue.The fogging on the Lumix took place on the inside of the lens, ruining my ability to use the camera (take clear shots) until the moisture inside the camera evaporated. Weak! When I'm on vacation, I want to be able to take shots when the opportunity presents itself, without having to wait for the camera to comply. Lumix lost major points on this issue.Picture quality -Once you familiarize yourself with the different picture settings, the D10 takes AMAZING pictures. The auto function does a pretty good job choosing the appropriate setting, but you should be comfortable navigating through the menu to tweak it for the environment you find yourself in. Very easy.The most surprising aspect of the D10 is the power of the macro setting. Believe it or not, the macro setting produces shots that rival my girlfriend's Canon Rebel TSI with telescopic lens. Granted, you have to be much closer to the object since you can't use a telescopic lens, but when I show people the pictures I took with the D10 on macro, they simply do not believe I used a camera that cost under $300.The Lumix does take excellent pictures, but they just weren't as striking as the shots taken by the D10.Video quality -Although the Lumix takes high def video (if you have an SD card with a write speed of 10MB/sec or greater), the video quality of the D10 should be fine for the needs of your average consumer. The difference between the video quality was not enough for me to want to keep the Lumix rather than the D10. What good does high def do me if the lens is fogged up?I did buy the accessory kit for the D10. It's over-priced and not necessary unless you plan on doing an extreme sport that requires using both hands (rock climbing) and need to clip it to your body instead of your wrist. Spend your money on a high quality SD card and extra batteries instead. I do recommend the Maximal Power DB CAN NB-6L sold by amazon. It doesn't last quite as long as the factory battery, but it is well worth $6.Durability -The D10 is extremely durable. It worked perfectly 10,000ft up on Haleakala and 30ft deep in the Pacific. I used the D10 underwater at least 15 separate times within 2 weeks without any issues. I didn't worry about it at all in my pocket or backpack as I went from adventure to adventure on Maui. It is not perfectly rectangular like the Lumix, but it still easily fits in the pocket of cargo shorts. The lens on the D10 is set further back in the housing design, protecting it from accidental scratching more so than the design of the Lumix.Don't hesitate in picking up the D10, it has given me pictures that I will cherish for many years.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Many hours in the water", "Author": "Paul T.

But what about the shock-proof and water-proof aspects?My daughter and I have had four trips recently where the D10 got its workout in the water.  While we never took it deeper than 12 feet, it performed flawlessly, and I was most impressed with the automatic color correction in the water -- those typical blue and green casts were barely there -- and I wasn't even in the \"underwater mode\".For the shock-proof feature, we dropped it onto concrete from five feet (not on purpose!).  It landed on the lens housing first; there is a tiny little scratch there.  Other than that, there is no evidence it was ever dropped.  All the functionality is still there, and the pictures look great.  Shock-proof test: passed.I was initially a bit disappointed that there was no lens cap or automatic lens cover.  I can understand about the automatic cover posing problems for the waterproof feature, and I know that I would not like having to deal with a physical lens cap.  However, with a lot of real use, I actually like it the way it is.  The scratch-proof lens is quite recessed in the lens housing, so I don't know how I'd ever damage it.The other thing I wish the camera had was a RAW mode.  As of the time of this writing, CHDK (Google it) doesn't have the D10 version available yet, but I guess it won't be too long.  (I use CHDK on my other two Canon Powershot cameras.)One final (minor) disappointment was the absence of GPS capability built in.  I guess I'll have to keep using my current manual merge approach (whose inconvenience limits my desire to actually map the images).One thing that appeared to be quirky at first, but I absolutely love now, is the wrist-strap attachment design.  The attachment is a quick-disconnect design, and it can connect to any of the four corners of the camera.  At a recent trip to an amusement park, I loop-locked the strap around my belt and put the camera in my pocket.  I had no fear about going on any of the roller coaster rides -- the camera was safe.  When I wanted to take a picture, I'd just pull it out of my pocket, release the quick-disconnect, and use the camera.Overall a great camera, and well worth the lengthy pre-order wait.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Leaked First Time Underwater", "Author": "H. Foley", "ReviewID": "R37X1GBLA547YF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for almost a year, and loved it.  Great photos for a small \"field trip\" camera.  I purchased in primarily so I could have a good camera at the beach and around water without worrying about it getting ruined by sand or water.  I liked the idea of being able to take underwater pictures with it, but rarely would have an opportunity to do so.  This June I took the camera to Maui and was excited to finally take some underwater photos with it.  I made sure everything was closed tightly, and only took it underwater about 6-10 feet (well within the range it's supposed to be safe).  After about 12 photos, the camera stopped working.  Back at the hotel, I tried recharging the battery, but it still wouldn't turn on.  I didn't see any apparent signs of leakage, but decided to try blow drying the camera just in case.  After blow drying for several minutes, the camera turned on and I was able to take a picture.  Half an hour later, it wouldn't turn on again.  Long story short, the camera was dead.  I was extremely disappointed because I was on my first trip ever to Maui, with no waterproof camera.  I called Canon, spent 45 minutes on the phone and talked to three different people (I kept asking for the next level up).  Eventually, I found someone who agreed to ship a refurbished camera overnight to my hotel so that I could at least get some pictures my last few days in Maui.  The refurbished camera worked great (although I stayed at the surface of the water and never dived with it, for fear it would leak), and I got some really fun underwater pictures.  I give Canon five stars for their customer service, and I have several other Canons, including two DSLRs that I love.  I was very disappointed that this camera failed me at the time I needed it most.

I took a series of 100+ shots outside water, and was very happy with the results and file quality (I normally use a high-end Canon DSLR semi-professionally). In fact, I rented this camera from a camera rental outfit to test it before buying one.Unfortunately, during my first snorkeling outing in Hawaii and on only the second day of my vacation, the camera leaked in water. I was dismayed because I had checked and rechecked all the ports for the presence of dust. I even made sure to press the ports down firmly to get a tight seal. Everything seemed perfect, but it wasn't so. I only noticed the leak inside the camera after it stopped working while snorkeling. I came out of the water right away, but there was already water inside the camera, as seen by water pearls on the back of the LCD, and in front of the lens. Ironically, a couple next to me in the water had the same camera and theirs was working perfectly.Of course, even drying the camera for a week didn't revive it. The guys at LensRentals were super nice when I called them right away, and refunded the rental price.  Unfortunately, I could not take any underwater images during the whole vacation as a result.The idea behind this type of camera is great, but I believe that it's implementation, whether Canon, Olympus, etc, is fraught with potential for disastrous leaks.

Pettingill", "ReviewID": "R9NUJIGAJ58DN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My husband and I bought this camera just before a recent canyoneering trip to Monterrey, Mexico.  Our Olympus failed on the last trip (to be fair - it took quite a beating), so we thought we would get something with better photo/video quality that could still handle the harsh environment.  We were concerned about the size and shape of this camera, as it really is too big to slip into your shirt pocket (or any other pocket for that matter), but thought that the markedly better photo/video quality would make up for the bulkiness in lugging it around.  Plus, we have had very good experiences with Canon customer service in the past, and not so much with Olympus, so we thought we'd give the Canon waterproof camera a chance.  HUGE mistake!The main problem that we have with this camera, is that the lens does NOT shed water.  It's not a problem if you have any possible way of drying the lens, but as an avid canyoneer - once you get into that wetsuit for a wet canyon, every dry item you have is stored in the dry bag or keg and not easily accessible until you're out of the canyon. We tried everything we could possibly think of to get the water off the lens - *dipping the camera in the water again and shaking it (works with most other waterproof cameras) - no go here *someone suggested wiping with a bandana (supposedly helps even when wet) - didn't work *wiping with fingers with and without neoprene gloves - it just spread the water around *Q-tips in a ziplock in the camera case - ziplock wasn't strong enough to keep out the water, plus it's extremely inconvenient anyway *licking the lens (laugh if you want, but we were desperate!) - helps a little, but in the end I decided the risk in unfamiliar water wasn't worth itSo, at the end of the spectacular water canyon (Matacanes) we have dreamed about going to for well over a year, at least 30-40% of our pictures were so blurred by the water spots, they weren't even worth keeping. Most of the others had blurry spots in them, but they were at least decent enough to preserve the memory.  I got to where I mostly shot video, as at least I didn't have to worry about the camera getting confused as to what it should focus on (I'm assuming that was part of the problem with the still shots and all of the water, but I don't know a lot about photography, I just enjoy it).  The videos are still fairly blurry, but they are better than not having anything.So, all in all, this camera takes great photos/videos COMPLETELY OUT OF THE WATER, or COMPLETELY SUBMERGED IN THE WATER.  If you just want a waterproof camera because you are worried about splashing on it at the beach or pool, or the kids spilling koolaid on it (and you will always have a way to dry off the lens for pictures outside of the water) - then this camera would probably be a good fit for you.  I would also imagine it would be good for snorkeling or scuba diving.  However, if you are consistently in and out of the water and picture quality is important to you both in and out of the water - DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!  You will be sorely disappointed!!  We will be sending ours back.A few more things... some positives... I did like the way the camera has 4 points of attaching the hand loop. That can come in handy. I also like the idea of the accessory pack - the chest harness (we just thought it was extremely overpriced so we decided against it).  The camera did seem very durable and handled temperature change well without condensation underneath the lens (I was told this had to do with temp change, but maybe humidity as well?).  The battery/memory card compartment was a bit of a challenge to open as it had a very good, tight seal on it - this is a good thing.Also fyi - the battery does not have an impressive life.  Ours died about 2/3 of the way through the canyon, after a full charge.  Our friends with Olympus and Pentax cameras lasted well beyond ours.Thanks and good luck!!", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Waterproof Camera", "Author": "PandaPoo", "ReviewID":

I have not been disappointed.Some reviewers complained that it was a little slow and that it didn't shoot in RAW.  It's important to remember that this is a point and shoot.

My husband and I both have Canon SLRs and were very impressed with the clarity of our underwater shots with this camera.It is a little bulkier than I was wanting, but it also feels very sturdy.  I really feel that I can take it anywhere without worrying about it.  It has fallen off a table, and passed the shock proof test.  There is no lens cover, but the lens is protected and does not scratch.The battery life is nothing to brag about.  I would recommend a spare battery, as well as a float strap if you plan to have it anywhere near deep water.Overall, I have been pleased with this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for good land and water shots.UPDATE: Having now used this camera for several months, I still love it, but have one word of advice if you take it in salt water: rinse it very well, and be sure to remove the strap to rinse out the corner where it screws in.

Make sure you have a soft, cotton surface to dry the lens off with when transitioning from wet to dry as water droplets adhere to the lens.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "For versatility, it's a winner", "Author": "Mike in Texas", "ReviewID": "RAB5E19R5JD22", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera mainly for its versatility for a rafting trip/vacation. Checked competing cameras, and read the recently posted Waterproof Camera Shoot-Out on [..], an Amazon subsidiary.  The review of this one is spot-on.  The camera is a little chunky, but feels solid, and I didn't mind at all having it thrash around while strapped to my life jacket.  I struggled with the price, some of its competitors are half of this, but in the end took a chance that the image quality would be worth it.Here's what I liked: - Image stabilization, even in video mode, made taking clear pictures and video a snap, even on the water. - Face detection made me confident in auto-focus. - Easy for a young child to hold and shoot, and drop-rated, too. - Decent image quality in a variety of scene types.  Most of our shots have been on dry land.  Great images in bright light, as long as the lens is clean. - Works underwater!  Nice clear images from the pool.Here's what I didn't like: - Hard to switch between photo and video mode on the fly - Fuji looks a lot easier for this with its single button. - Fingerprint magnet - lens got lots of fingerprints from kids, often had to clean it to avoid murky pictures. - Somewhat hard-to-press shutter.  Expect some camera shake in young kids.  Stabilization helps a lot. - Too big for pockets.In the end, my daughter LOVED taking pictures with it, so I guess it was worth it for the flexibility and kid-friendliness.

I was never happy with the image quality of the Olympus.  Visible noise at even base ISO.  The D10 puts that sad little camera to shame.  Clean images at ISO 80-200, usable at 400, and even salvageable (for the most part) at 800/1600.  The colors are clear and saturated, and the automatic metering is quite amazing.  It manages to correctly expose some scenes that are quite challenging, especially for such a small sensor.  The image quality is very impressive.My main use for this camera is canyoneering.  In canyon environments the camera is exposed to every kind of grit and water.  A shockproof/waterproof camera is essential.  I love this camera for this purpose!  It handles the water and the harsh environment very well.It's not up to the standards of a non-waterproof compact at the same price.  This is to be expected, as a non-waterproof would last 10 seconds in the places I take my D10.Cons:- A tiny bit bulky.  I found a case from Mountainsmith that fits it well enough.  A small price to pay for the better non-folded optics.- 35mm at the wide end is a bit restrictive.  I shoot vertical shots and stitch them together to go wider- 105mm at the tele end is just a tad short- No Av/Tv/M modes- 720p video would have been nice, but not essentialPros- Very fast startup time.  I love how I can grab it, turn it on, and take a picture within 1 second.- Fast operation time.  Everything the camera does feels very snappy- Smart auto mode.  I find I just use the auto mode, as it does a pretty remarkable job.  I only switch to P mode when I want to do something special.- Waterproof to 10m and shockproof.  Essential for wet/challenging environments- Face detect timer:  I love this feature, you can set up a group shot and then get into place.  When it sees another face, it will take a few pictures.- F2.8 lens gets faster shutter times so flash isn't always needed.If you canyoneer or kayak, you should probably buy this camera.EDIT:Not that anyone would consider this camera any more, but I thought I'd add to my review anyway.  The camera works well but is not very hardy when it comes to water.  I lost one to water getting behind the lens (Canon replaced it), and I lost the other to electronics failure due to water seepage.

He was roughly 3 year old since purchase, and was suffering from gross misuse of its durability specifications.First in the line of Waterproof cameras from Canon, Buddy the D10 was a champion since it came out, it won many review battles and side by side comparisons, and it though looking like a fat kid on the block next to his ELPH brothers, it was always humble and never complained.I still remember, the excitement when I heard of its release, the specs, the robustness and its waterproof nature, which for me was a time to put my Old Faithful, the Canon S2IS to rest.I live in Mumbai, India, which enjoys 4.5 months of good rain, including which there are 8 good months of riding season for a motorcycle enthusiast, and numerous weekend getaway places for 1 day or 2 day rides. There are hundreds of seasonal waterfalls and streams which become picnic spots just during these 4 months, and there are numerous beaches on the 500km stretch from Mumbai to Goa. While the S2IS was good overall, the D10 was 100x more suited for such conditions. Now I had been considering a waterproof jacket for the S2IS for quite some time, but it was such a compromise.Unavailable in India, I had to ship it from states, and because the warranty wasnt valid in India, I hesitated to \"test\" the waterproof nature for about 2 months Infact, I gave it to a close friend who was going on his honeymoon trip to Mauritius, in hope that he'd do it, but he chickened out too.We finally tested it in a bucket of water, and woo hoo! The joy I felt, a digital device performing under Water, it was like Magic!Buddy was a great hit in all parties, we'd set it up on a Mug of Beer, pretending to use it like a tripod, and bang the table slightly so that it falls into the Beer. The people in neighbouring tables would shriek, the waiters would apologize and Buddy would stand up, and take a bow. :)The D10, then became a regular companion, and never said no to whatever test it was put to. Here's a list of its adventures:1) Motorcycle ride to Khardungla, the highest motorable road, temperatures of -10C, jittery terrain over 3000Kms, where it fell from a Motorcycle going 60kmph over rocks and snow.2) The 40+ waterfalls around mumbai3) Muddy waters of Beaches near city.4) Clean swimmingpools of Gym, and the waterparks5) Awesome beach waters of Goa, Pattaya, Maldives6) Sands of Rajasthan.7) 2 Holis - the color festival of India8) Numerous dunks in Water, Beer, Whisky, Vodka, Soap water and what notThe D10 was a favorite of kids  and elderly alike, you could leave it with anyone and not worry about it, and they'd return it with a smile. With a sturdy scratch free glass, it never needed a blower or a filter. You could WASH it or wipe it with a cloth, and it'd be ready!.In broad day light, the D10 was in its natural element, you just point it, it took good photos. Oh, the color's it'd capture!In dim-light or indoors, it'd struggle, you know its an outdoorsy camera.It was the most \"taken-for-granted\" thing in my bag, something which I never did worry about taking care of, and after a lot of misuse, it finally took its last breath when some water creeped in. I knew it was dying for some months, because the autofocus was getting hazy after the numerous falls (we did demo the 4 ft shockproof nature to several people). It died taking shots of me and friends, in one of the finest beaches of India, it had a good life.I have upgraded to a 600D after its demise, and I eagerly wait for the D20 to come out. For whatever greatness a 600D has, if the D20 is better than D10, there's no better \"dont worry about it\" gadget that you can handover to friends and family.Goodbye Friend, you'll be missed and fondly remembered.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "took great pictures while it lasted...now it has common lens error", "Author": "Kianta W.

My life takes me from temperatures of 0 degrees F to 115 degrees, from blowing sand and scalding sun to oppressive humidity.  I need to take pictures in canyons, mountains, forests, snowfields, beaches, lakes, swamps, rivers, the ocean, aquariums, swimming pools, and everywhere in between.  I needed the best waterproof, tough, portable camera on the market.  A buddy of mine had the Olympus Stylus-tough 6000 AND 8000 models, and I tried them both while canyoneering.  They were waterproof and shockproof, but that was about the only plus.  The pictures were crap, everything was fuzzy unless you held it perfectly still, they cannot handle contrast very well (sunny versus shaded in the same shot...as in canyons and practically EVERYWHERE I EVER AM), the menu system and camera operation speed were ATROCIOUS, the only used micro-SD cards...BLAH.  I was actually suprised by HOW disappointed I was in the Olympus models.  They were my first exposure to waterproof cameras, and let me tell you, I was not excited.But I needed something, so I bought a Canon D10. I was taking a bit of a gamble, having never owned a Canon product.  But, the name means something, so I figured I would try it.  I loved it.  I later lost it in the Colorado River (I didn't have a float strap, like an idiot), and in a fit of stupidity I tried the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS2 (I had owned and loved two Lumix DMC non-waterproof cameras previously).  Other than the fact that it isn't actually waterproof, it was a great camera.  Unfortunately, my life takes these cameras at their word, and if I can't trust that a camera will actually BE waterproof, I might as well stick with my Lumix DMC FZ28, which I LOVE.  After returning the not waterproof \"waterproof\" camera to Amazon (thank you for making that so easy, Amazon), I ordered another Canon D10.  Here is where I made my biggest mistake yet.  I thought I should try and branch out and buy something from somewhere other than Amazon for once, and I found a better deal from a company called \"Digital Elect\".  I won't bore you with details, but they suck.  They don't tell you that you're ordering a wholesale version of the camera with dismal battery life, and they call later to ask you if you want the REAL battery for another 50 bucks or so.  They push the whole gimmick by offering a free mini-tripod and some other chintzy garbage, THEN they charge you for shipping and TWO WEEKS LATER it still hasn't arrived.  I hate them and I will never shop there again.  You CANNOT beat Amazon's service, speed, and prices, and selection of products.  Whenever my new camera arrives (I hate you, Digital Elect), I will be elated to see it.  So, the executive summary:Cons:-bulging lens (doesn't fit in your pocket as nicely as other waterproof camera models)-mediocre video recording (not HD)-will get some condensation inside if you spend many hours a day underwater without drying it out between snorkeling sessions-No external speaker (can only review sound from videos from computer, although I'm sure this helps the waterproofing).Pros+Excellent, Canon-quality images+Completely waterproof except in extreme conditions rarely encountered by a normal person (I'm a fish biologist), when it may get some condensation inside+hand strap attaches to any of the four corners+highly durable (mine was dropped, scratched, jostled, even thrown fifty feet down into a foot of water and became embedded in the sand - and still worked great - although I don't recommend this treatment)+Fast operation (time spent between turning on to taking pictures is much less than most cameras - the Lumix models are also good about this)+Easy menu operation with many features that I was still discovering before I lost my first D10+Can edit/crop/slow motion replay of video on the camera to save memory space and for hilarious replays.I guess that about sums it up.

With this in mind, I basically bought the camera for my trip to Hawaii without reading many reviews (BIG MISTAKE!!-Always read reviews) Which I did later and was able to take the adequate recommendations.As I had an EXCELLENT experience and all the pictures came out amazing: underwater, macro, scenic, etc. I give you my input as I think it is a great camera for the price.1- Waterproof/Leaks: You are buying an underwater camera,so take care of it like any underwater camera!. After every time you open the battery/SD card latch or the side port to connect to the computer, MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO PIECES OF DIRT/SAND. Clean it well (Consider using a thin brush), and I also put Vaseline around the O-Rings. So no problems after approx 10-15 snorkeling excursions with pictures taken down to about 12-15 feet. And NEVER open any of this doors in the middle of the trip unless you are SURE you can clean it well before taking it underwater again.2- Lense Failure/Error: Basically I took from all reviews that once the battery is dying, the lense could give this error message. So, every night before a long trip, I would fully charge the battery. I had bought an extra battery but just returned it because I did not use it.3- Picture delay: It takes a bit of time between focusing and actually taking the picture, so keep this in mind specially if you are taking action shots or just underwater holding your breath.4- Bulky: It is uncomfortable to carry in your side pocket, but I never had an issue carrying it... It is not a slim frame.5- Accessory pack: This I thought was EXTREMELY OVERPRICED as the other reviews and don't think it is worth your money. You can basically grab some other type of collar/sling and you save the $100.I guess that the previous comments can be applied to all waterproof cameras, so whatever you decide, good luck!", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best waterproof camera.

The D10 provides up to 33ft, so you can take it scuba diving, snorkeling or surfing.All digital cameras should be waterproof because you want a camera that you can take anywhere without worrying about spills, dirt, dust, freeze, or even dropping it (shock proof up to 4ft). Is not like you are taking pictures in baby showers and home parties all the time.The 12MP are great, the image quality underwater is beyond comparison.

Storie", "ReviewID": "R3MZ1A0BMHLQOD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife and I recently purchased this camera as we had been wanting a water-resistant camera to go snorkeling and swimming with. After searching all the currently available options we decided upon the Canon PowerShot D10 or the Olympus Tough 8000. Further user review reading revealed that the Olympus was prone to leakage as a result of the setting dial being hard to properly seal. The Canon has buttons which are easier to seal, and no external moving parts, so we decided to go with Canon. We also own two other Canon SLRs which also meant no additional software and compatible memory.Our first impressions were good. We took the camera on a trip to Orlando with friends and used it in the hotel pool (worked very well), the ocean, and the manta-ray pond at Sea World. In all cases the camera took an excellent picture. There was no leakage, or problems with sand. We did rinse the camera as suggested which I highly recommend as you can feel the salt buildup on the exterior of the camera after a day on the beach. Make sure NOT to open an of the battery/memory cover until AFTER your rinse. Follow the guidelines the Canon provides for use underwater and all should be well. At least it was for us.We were also hoping that the camera would be a good everyday point-and-shoot. We currently have an Olympus 810SW and it does a good job, but we are hoping to only carry one camera. This D10 was excellent for everyday pictures and performed very well in different environments. It has a relatively fast shutter speed, good flash when needed, and overall pictures were good.Be sure to purchase an additional floating strap as the camera will sink if you accidentally let it go.Overall the camera is definitely worth consideration if you want a camera of this nature. Here are some pros and consPros1. Goes underwater, and does it well.2. Shoots very good above-water shots.3. Uses SD memory - very common - and most laptops can read them directly4. Easy to use interface.5. People comment frequently when you take it underwater - \"Is that one of those underwater cameras?\"Cons1. No lens cover - the cover is supposed to be scratch resistant but it would be nice to be able to cover the cover when not in use.2. The AUTO function is quirky. We tended to shot in P mode and select the appropriate settings.3. You need practice taking pictures underwater. The auto-focus is a bit different underwater when compared to your eyes. Trust the camera in this case, and definitely practice.4.

Of course, when there's a 14ft great white 5 inches from your face, working a camera is not the top priority, so that could be partially to blame. On land, the picture quality is worse. Landscapes sort of fade away into the distance- anything far away will often be lost. There are almost no manual controls.

Bought it last year before going in vacation in Costa Rica, to ensure that I can get some pictures in the water or anywhere where and when I couldn't use my Canon Digital SLR. I have waited to review it until I used it enough times and in different conditions. It has held well on dry land and in water. The quality of the pictures is very good and it is very easy to use. I have taken pictures in the ocean, I went white water rafting with it, stayed in torrential rain and taken pictures, even zip-lined with it! While rafting some really white waters I had the camera in a tiny camera bag secured across my body. I fell in the water and I had no worries that my camera will die before I get back on my tube. I dropped it a few times and it's fine. The screen is actually the most exposed to shock and I have been trying to be careful about that. The lens are recessed so they are somehow protected. I have other Canon cameras and that is one reason I went with this camera. It had most of the features I wanted, plus a movie mode. The movies are decent quality, even in a dark, with smoke-effects party hall, and good sound. I even recorded small videos at a concert hall in NYC, and I was amazed at the clarity of the sound.I take it everywhere I think I might have a chance to get some shots and don't want to lug around the backpack with the big 'guns'. It fits in a pocket or a woman's purse (not tote) with no problem.PROs: stylish, easy to use and carry around, very user-friendly, amazing picture and good video quality, even in water. It also rotates the image on the screen, like the Ipod.CONs: screen protection is recommended, sometimes when I put it in the water and then took it out the lens 'sweated' for a few minutes, when trying to take pictures in bright sun, with the sun reflecting in the screen, the image completely blacks.It is by far not as fast as a DSLR, even with a fast card in. It takes a few seconds longer until it 'charges' again for the next shot, even when not using the flash. At night, it's better used with a tripod or have very steady hands. The image will come out shaken. During the day light this doesn't seem to be a problem, but the IS doesn't seem to be working very well with the night settings.I like this camera and I recommend it.

I've had my camera nearly 2 years. I typically only use this camera if I'm going to be in the water at the beach, on a boat, SCUBA diving, or snorkeling (the rest of the time I use my digital SLR)  Obviously, this can only be used for shallow dives when SCUBA diving because of the 33 ft limit, but some of the best shots can be taken on these dives.Pros:I've had no problems using this camera with my 7mm gloves on for my cold dive near the Coronado Islands by San Diego and got some awesome pictures of sea lions swimming around us.  I even accidentally went to 36 ft with this camera and nothing went wrong; I still wouldn't recommend testing this just to make sure.  I've also used this in warm water in the Bahamas with awesome pictures.The wrist strap is adjustable, which is very nice when wearing no gloves vs wearing gloves.I've used this camera while skiing in temps below 20 degrees and had no problems with operation or battery life shortage.This is a great camera for use in swimming pools!Great camera to take kayaking!Much much much much better underwater camera than a disposable underwater camera.  If you love water sports at all, you will get your money's worth out of this camera!Cons:33 ft underwater limit.  Would have loved for this to go on my 50 ft shark dives in the Bahamas, or any of my other deep dives. This isn't for people who never do shallow dives.The only problem I've had with it on my dives is that if someone is around you stirring up any sand, etc, the camera likes to focus on the sand floating around you instead of the subject.The viewfinder was easily scratched when I was sliding down a boulder on the beach and the camera slid a couple inches from where it was, so just be careful around rocks; otherwise I've dropped it multiple times with no damage.Another problem I've had is when the camera is underwater and then taken out and you try to take a picture above water immediately.  Water drops like to stick to my camera lens to blur the image.  If you take it out of the water just right, it sometimes doesn't have this problem.Recommendations:I highly recommend having it set to underwater mode (with the fish and bubbles) while underwater instead of auto because the color looks better on this mode; more realistic to what I'm actually seeing underwater.Make sure to \"clean\" this camera after being in water by placing it in a bowl of tap water for about an hour and wiping it dry, otherwise, the buttons get sticky.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the money", "Author": "Tammy", "ReviewID": "R1F5LO0UJMIJ0Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was going to buy a cheap underwater camera to use on vacation for snorkeling but in reading reviews on the various models out there, I kept coming back to the Cannon.

And as I can recall, visibility underwater then wasn't very awesome.Later, it got much more difficult to get the focus on the right objects. I don't know why that happened.I had to half-press the buttons many times to get the right focus.And the visibility had to be excellent for it to function well.But the thing I appreciate the most about this camera is its durability.My dive instructor for advanced open water once showed me the tennis ball was half dented at 30m while no one could squeeze it on the boat. I was horrified even thinking about bringing my camera to that depth. The specified maximum depth on the camera was 10m for God's shake.Then I went to Sipadan, which was said to be world class dive site. All dives there were wall dives and dive average depth was 30m. I took the risk and brought the camera down with me. Because the camera was USD250, I thought if it could help me seize a few moments down there in photos and then broke, that would be good enough.But to my surprise, it survived all the dives. The deepest dive I did during that trip was about 28m.It was raining a lot during my trip, cloudy sky most of times. The visibility was very much affected by the weather condition. At 20-30m, it was too dark to judge if the camera functioned well down there.But anyway, a few things I noticed:It's very difficult to get focus at 20m+ depth. The button didn't really respond to my presses. The battery ran out quickly. I later figure that because at 20+ depth, the water pressure was so high that the button was constantly pressed, not to the point the shots were taken, but it prevented the camera from going to standby mode to save battery (I never turned off camera underwater. It just took so long to turn on and the objects might swim far away already by the time I got the camera ready). And maybe because the button was more than half-pressed all the time, the camera got confused about focus placing.Well, I couldn't blame it for these flaws that only happened at depths that were twice or three times its maximum allowed depth.  And notably, as soon as we ascended to 15m or above, with good visibility, the camera functioned very well again.I was constantly asked by divers what camera I had. This camera was small and so very convenient to bring during dives. So I had more time and more fun with the underwater world. Other divers, who were very serious about underwater photography, brought along huge pieces of equipment, which sort of freaked me out.When I was choosing my first underwater camera, I was wavering between a G10 or a D10 both by Canon. For a G10 which already cost nearly USD800, if my memory serves me correctly, I would still have needed to buy the housing, which would have been another USD200; while a D10 was only USD250, and I could spend the difference for another dive trip.Also I've noticed many buyers seem to not like its bulky shape. But I think because the camera's cover being curved out, it could sustain the pressure at high depth.At first, I disliked the small screen. But later after I brought it down to beyond 20m+, the screen became like squeezed and became \"wavy\", I thought the screen was of just the right size.This review is written from a diver perspective.

I assumed that either there were some manufacturing problems with a few units, or that people weren't securing the access doors properly. Last week I took the camera into the water and within just a few minutes the display had gone dark. I hoped it was just a battery problem, but I realized later that mine had leaked. I had triple checked the doors, so I really believe that the gaskets have failed. Now the camera won't show any signs of life.The memories and photos from last year are worth what I paid for the camera because while it worked, it worked really well, but be warned. The reports of this camera leaking and failing are true. I've bought many Canon products over the years and this one is the first one that let me down.Update 12-11-2011I just went to the Canon website to get a quote to repair the camera.  It is four months out of warranty, and they want $190 plus tax to repair it.  I don't think I'll be spending the money on it, so I guess it will go on my shelf of failed technology.

Being someone who relies on reviews before any large item purchase, I think it was my duty to write a great review on a FANTASTIC product!Knowing that I would be going on a trip to Mexico, I knew water activities would be included so naturally I thought it was important to purchase a camera for those times.  I had 5 days until trip take-off, so it was hard taking the time to find the \"right one\". With about 2 hours of searching I stumbled upon a few that I thought would suit me well.  I paid for the 2 day shipping and got it right on time, ran out to the store to get the SD card while the battery charged.  The first few pics were amazing so I knew this camera wouldn't fail me.  Scared for the let down (per several other reviews), I did not test it in water first, in fact my fiance threw it in the swimming pool about an hour after arriving to our resort!!!! Screaming I went in after the camera... everything was just fine with it! The seals are solid, in fact at times hard to open the compartments, but would take that considering it's protectint it from water.  I did also by the yellow CHUMS wrist float, which also held up incredibly well, in the ocean & pool the camera did not sink to the bottom thanks to that floatation device. The thing I wish I would have known is that for water proof cameras there is a solution to help keep the water from fogging up the lens & screen. It allows the water to bead up and roll off the screens. A friend told us in that pinch that spitting, YES, SPITTING on the lens and screen, rub the salive around then re-submerge in whatever water you are in would help. Sure enough, it did! Of course you have to do it a few times during your trip if you are in water a lot but it worked!!!The camera was submerged the majority of the 8 days there, in swimming pools, hot tubs and the ocean, amazingly there were no issues, it held up great throughout the whole thing.  One downfall was the battery (granted a day and a half of constant video taking and photographing is not bad) but I was devastated that it died while we were out whale watching, and it was about 15 minutes after we found the whales!We laughed all the time about people screaming that their cameras or cells phone were getting wet in the various activities, since that was the last thing we had to worry about.  I had two cameras with me and after the second day I quit switching back and forth between dry and wet activities cause the CANON far superceeded my expectations, even when taking noraml dry land photos.  I forgot this this was a 12megapix camera so of course the photos were clear, bright and outstanding!It is no SLR but who would want to spend that kind of money for a camera that can't get wet on the spot, we still have our nice camera for professional looking photos, but it's not something we want to risk breaking, losing or damaging while on vacation, not to mention it's sheer size! This canon is portable, compact and goes anywhere and everywhere with you esp on those fun family trips! In hind sight I would have paid $500-600 on this thing for the quality and durability. We did drop it about 10 feet, on accident, but it never skipped a beat. This little thing is a gem!At first I was in agreement with others who said that it does lag between picture taking, but for those times when you want it to go faster you can change it to take more, even continuously by just pressing and holding the shutter button! Highly satisfactory!If you are still concerned, I wouldn't be. Even if something happens to the camera (drops and doesn't work or water damage) there is a factory warrenty and from prior experience with Canon they honor their warrenties, and fast.Hope this helps others of you!!

I have worked as a professional photographer and can take care of those cameras, however I have a tendency to be rough on my point and shoots. I've gone through 3 Sony point and shoots in the last 2 years, so when looking for a new camera, I wanted a DURABLE one.After doing a lot of research and reading a lot of reviews, this camera stood out as the top durable, waterproof, all around camera. And I am quite happy with it so far after 4 months.This camera ha withstood 10+ foot drops from my roof, getting stepped on, dropped, beer spilt on it, left out in a rainstorm over night, fell out of my car while rushing around dropping people off, videotapping sledding, got lost in a snow drift, and lot of little sticky kid hands and has taken everything like a CHAMP. It has never once froze, halted, stopped, or died!Now onto the taking picture parts. My sister has a Canon Powershot that I have been superimpressed with, in terms of photo quality, speed, and use of flash in low light settings and I thought I would be getting that performance with this one, which is what really sold me on the camera. However, I was a little disappointed. It does take fantastic pictures in perfect light, however in low light situations the flash is SLOW and pictures do not always come out in focus. Underwater, you have the same problem in low light settings. It's battery life is also incredibly poor, I have to charge it after 300 pictures.The features on the camera are rather nice, however. It's easy to use and navigate, and you have lots of fun options to play with. It's automatic settings work quite nicely, and change according to your lighting situation seamlessly. The hatches are hard to open, but should be. It took me a bit to finesse finagling with the ball at the end of the strap to get the hatches open. They seal very well, you know when the click in. I've had it underwater numerous times Extreme Todepooling (snorkeling in tidepools) up to 5 ft and it works quite happily. I wash it off with fresh water at the bathrooms after and have never had any problems with it malfunctioning.In terms of portability and size, this thing is a BEAST, but that's why I love it. It's meant to take whatever you give it, it's build to be tough not pretty. It's got more weight then your usual point and shoot but can fit in a small/medium purse without a problem (it doesn't take up too much room in my square Harvey's purse) I've beaten mine up and so far the body has no visible scratches on it.

I took a couple friends sailing the other day and they had forgotten to charge the batteries on their water-proof digital.  So I let them use mine for the day.  They said the differences were shocking.  To them, the Canon was easier to figure out, faster loading, and had a faster 'shutter speed' (I know that in digital, it's not really a shutter). They were also impressed by the 30' water depth capability of the Canon.  Their camera  a major brand sold at Costco) was nearly the same price as the Canon, and was only rated to 3 meters (about 9')The picture quality was IMPRESSIVE. The one thing I was a little surprised at was the drain down on the battery.  We took about 90 pictures that day and the battery was wiped out.  We only had a handful of pics that used the flash - so I was surprised the battery did not last longer.  I'm adjusting some of the settings such as how long the LCD stays on and seeing if I can get better battery results next time.

However, there are a few things we are not happy with and users should be aware of.  FIrst, the bar of soap / submarine shape is not very good for something you want to hold on to.  It slid out of my wife's hands one time when she went to pick it up and hit the floor.  One of the strap mounts popped out and it got a little ding on the corner of the LCD display.  Fortunately it continued to work, remains watertight and I glued the strap button back in with some G-Flex epoxy.  Second is an occasional \"lens error\" message that pops up.  We have had three Canon cameras in this price range over the years and two out of three suffered from this problem.  I figured some dirt had gotten into the mechanism that moves the optics for zooming but this is not possible for the D10.  All of the mechanism is totally sealed and all motion takes place inside the camera.  Dirt and water can't get in.  I'm surprised that after having the \"lens error\" problem for about a decade that Canon hasn't resolved it.  Search the web for \"canon lens error\".  Third, be very careful using this camera where there are jets of water i.e. around a running hose, the water park, etc.  The streams of water can have enough force to get past the seals in the camera.  I suspect that tossing the camera into the water or moving it swiftly through the water can also breach seals in the camera.  I noticed a few spots of condensation inside the LCD screen cover while taking pictures at the water park.  Though the camera still worked fine, I immediately removed the battery, and set it in the sun for about an hour with battery and connector doors open.  The condensation cleared and all is well.So, nice camera but needs some help in the ergonomics department and Canon needs to dispense with the \"lens error\" problem some of these cameras have once and for all!!!Two years after the above review and the camera still works well with no more lens errors.  I think moisture inside the camera was causing the lens error.  However, we avoid using it in the water now since it's no longer waterproof.  I also made a little wooden grip out of a 7/8\" diameter dowel that is glued to the right side of the camera (Looking from the back) using West Systems G-Flex epoxy so that we can get a better grip.  Works great and my wife loves the \"upgrade\".  When I wanted a waterproof camera I wound up getting a Canon ELPH 300 HS and a waterproof case for it.

They had a no questions 30 day return/exchange policy, and I was within the time limit, so the kind salesperson sent me out a new one.

And i totally loved it, we loved it.And another review after it got flooded.This is my 3rd review of this camera.We got this June 2009... Have been very useful in our nature trips both for taking underwater photos and videos... most esp. with salt/fresh water. We've used this in so many places which involves salt water!April 2010 -- was about to use it for our night swimming at a workmate's place.Was able to take 5 photos in the pool shower. While dipped in the pool, i tried to take shots, was able to take one shot in the pool and a short video, then it suddenly turned off... Bham! Wont turn on. Looking at it, screen and lens began to show waters in them, guessing water went in the A/V port seal, because when i checked all seals, its the one wet inside.When i got home, it got even more obvious, the water totally flooding the lens like it's crying and so as the mists on its screen.So we bought a new D10 for me to be able to use for my upcoming spelunking/trekking trip in the highlands.My then BF now hubby, brother and I even kept it as a secret from my parents... =)))I left it in the **** for my brother to use *lucky him* and bought all possible protections for it in case they will use it underwater (dicapac -- weird but i did bought a dicapac for my 2nd D10), and brought the flooded D10 to the US since it was ordered here.September 11, 2010 -- was cleaning and rearranging stuffs at home... then i came across my flooded D10, no more water in the lens, and only got some few mists / fog on the screen but barely noticeable......it has been looking dry 2 months ago but its still dead each time i attempted turning on its power...*we have not thrown it yet coz we planned to return it to canon which we forgot to or we can just dissect it and play with it in the future * i know it's broken, but i just want to mess with it this time, putting the battery on the camera and pushed the power button...Waaaaaaaaaah! -- it turned on!I took my first shot ever since it got flooded...I had a decent one!And took more shots to test it...All photos turned out so fine and there's no sign of weird markings that the flooding may have caused.Plus... its original canon battery, still has charge in it. The last time it was charged was April 2010, and it's already September 2010. This is a wow for me and my husband!Now my concern is my camera's accessories which i left in the **** with my brother having my 2nd and newer D10... case, strap, charger, and extra batts.It's working like its never been flooded...This is a case of RESURRECTION!CANON i salute you and i love you!Imagine, my once dead Powershot D10 has revived life on its own!To CANON:if you want to see the before and after photos of my D10, feel free to email me for it. it's even on my FB coz i was soooo happy about it and so astounded. I knew some people who had to bring their flooded D10's in the repair centers and leave them there instead of having it repaired since the centers are asking for almost the same price to fix it...that's nuts.. but hey... this is something you should check on your next waterproof camera, if you will be producing a new one. Test it for the same accident i had.Though i know people doesnt have 3-4 months to wait for it to completely dry up internally. Like us, we bought a 2nd D10.This experience from my Canon D10 is as of April 8, 2010.As Canon announced that they will be releasing a waterproof camera, me and my boyfriend got so excited about it. So we pre-ordered it from Amazon as early as May 2009.We got the product by June 11,2009.It is one of the first batches of D10.Now, we are not pretty sure if what had happened to our precious D10 is a manufacturer's defect.We were able to use it in our trips:JUNE - 4 days 3 nights at the shower, bathtub, beach, fresh water pool, etc., with water activities such as snorkeling, etc.JULY - then another 3 days 2 nights  at the beach, with much rougher water activities, more underwater shots, snorkeling...DECEMBER - 4 days 3 nights with cave tour with water in it, trekking, swim into falls, fog fog fog in the mountains with cold temp.MARCH - another island hopping for 2 days 1 night...and alot of dry conditions...so this camera lasted us almost 9 months.when i was about to use it in an overnight swimming at a chlorined pool with some friends, we were able to use it in the shower, took 3 shots, jumped to the pool and took 3 shots, then while i was manipulating the buttons for the settings, it suddenly shut off.so i unplunged, wiped my hands and the camera, i looked at the 2 seals it had, completely and perfectly sealed.i decided to open the seal that contains the battery and MMC, it is dry.then i opened the seal that has the AV ports, what can i say, it has water in it...it leaked in short.i was shocked about this.. i cant believe it did... my dreams all fell *joke!*...the following morning i went to a local canon store here and bought a new one.... for assurance, i  also bought a DICAPAC or a waterproof case made for digital cameras.i emailed canon usa, since it was bought there, they asked us to mail it them, so most likely we will be able to mail it to them on june, i am in south east asia right now and my boyfriend in central asia,  hopeful for a replacement when we both return to the US in june, this time using our new and 2nd Canon d10, newest batch (since the saleslady mentioned the camera just arrived to them the day before my purchase... does that have to relieve me?) for another island tour...Yatta!an important advice given to me by the store owner where i bought DICAPAC, that after use of these waterproof cameras, WASH THEM IN FRESH WATER (all seals closed of course)... PAT IT DRY IN CLOTH... USE A BLOWER (hair blower is fine) TO DRY THE SEALS (both open and closed seals, be sure hands and camera are dry and no more traces of water droplets whatsoever)...since chlorine and salt water eventually corrodes these WP seals...as a best option when doing more dipping of the WP cameras in water, protect it with underwater cases.handling of the camera with wet hands would not require the case... just if you will use it UNDERWATER...sharing the photos of the mishaps of my D10... with the lens flooded by water like it was crying...hahaha! and the moist and water on the LCD... gaaaar...even so, me and boyfriend still loves canon... we got loads of canon items from all in one printer to HD vidcam...[...]my DICAPAC underwater camera case[...]you may also see the underwater shots i had with it both photos and videos...it has the best features ever for a WP camera until it leaked...=(", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "First Use and No Problems", "Author": "Larry W. Jordan", "ReviewID": "R1HZ7TT1HENYUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought the D10 earlier this year, and just returned from vacation.  Used the camera several times in the salt water (never really more than a couple of feet under water), and had no problems.  The controls were easy to use, although I'm sure it helped that I also used it most of the time out of the water.  Pictures both in and out of the water were very good, and the video under the water is pretty neat!  The IS on this camera is amazing.  I do have problems with the AWB on indoor shots, but not a big issue.A couple of suggestions if you get one.  Get a keychain float (like the ones they sell for boat keys) and put it on the strap.  The camera does not float without something like this on it.  Also take a big plastic cup with you on vacation.  After being in salt water, you need to soak it in fresh water for a few hours.  This is much easier if you have a cup that you can fill with water and drop your camera in for soaking.  Get a large SD card (8 gig or more) and an extra battery.  You don't want to open that compartment any more than you have to.  Start with an empty SD card and a fully charged battery.  The battery does last several days.A few ideas for Canon.  Either include a couple of spare \"Strap Mounts\" with the camera, or just put metal loops on the corners to attach the straps.  You can buy extras from Canon at about $20 each, but that shouldn't be required just to attach a strap.  You do get one for the wrist strap, but it would be great to have another for a neck strap.  I would also suggest having something around the display on the back of the camera (like a small rubber ridge) just to keep the display off of the surface of whatever you set the camera down on.  It doesn't sit well on the \"bottom\", and most times ends up laying on its back with the display down.  I worry about it getting scratched over time.Great camera, just the right size IMO, and takes good pictures both in and out of the water.  Nice to have on the beach or by the pool.======== Update as of 4/1/2011Have used the D10 on several vacations now, and continue to have great luck.  I always soak it in fresh water after using it in salt water, and work all of the buttons to keep it clean.  I have not had a problem with scratches on the back display as I had been worried about.A few things I've learned... First, you really need to ensure you set the mode to underwater before you take underwater pictures.  Makes a big difference (mostly due to white balance).  Second, when you have used the camera underwater, you need to have something dry to wipe the lense when back on dry land.  A couple of drops of water can ruin your pictures.  Third, try not to use the flash underwater.  It seems to highlight the small little white floating things in the water, and makes the water look not as clear.Camera is easy and fun to use.  The only concern I would have if buying one now is when is the next version going to be out?", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kick Ass Underwater Camera", "Author": "The Den", "ReviewID": "R1TOGFURC82F9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best compact waterproof camera I've ever used (and I'm a photographer).

The camera did not disappoint.  I initially thought of buying an underwater housing for a Canon that I already own, but second guessed this when I spotted the D10.  I have been a fan of Canon digital cameras for years.  I chose Canon due to my own personal preference as well as ease of use due to common/similar camera functions.I had no problems with the camera, and I was able to take some amazing photos and video, both underwater and on land.  The underwater setting was key to getting colorful photos of turtles, fish and coral.  Others have commented and I will agree, the trick to getting great underwater photos is to dive down and get level or below the subject.  On one occasion, I forgot to set the camera to underwater mode.  The photos still turned out, but without as vibrant color tones.  The auto and sunset modes also worked very well.The battery lasted all day long each day (sometimes taking in excess of 150 photos and some video), but I will probably buy a spare in the near future just to be sure.I must say that I was a bit nervous taking the camera into the ocean the first time.  I took the camera snorkeling approximately 10 times during the trip, to maximum depths of about 20ft and did not have any problems.  I was very careful to inspect the seals, soak the camera in fresh water and completely dry it out before opening.  On one occasion I inadvertently dropped the camera in the sand.  I soaked, cleaned and dried the camera upon return to the hotel.  Prior to closing the camera, I noticed a few grains of sand on one of the seals.  Had I missed the sand grains, the camera might have leaked.  My advice is to carefully inspect the seals for sand, dirt, or other debris before closing, and follow the instructions in the manual very closely.I did not abuse the camera, but it did take a bit of punishment.  Several times I found myself tumbled around the rocks by breaking waves.  The camera faired better than I did, with no scratches on the lens or screen and just a small ding on the case.There were whales in the vicinity of Molokini Crater, and their calls (incidental to the scenes I was shooting) can be heard clearly on underwater video!  I was very pleasantly surprised with the underwater audio quality.I carried a small lens cloth in my bag, and rinsed the lens and wiped it off after use in salt water and before taking photos on land.  Make sure you do not have water drops on the lens if it is getting used both in and out of the water.  While snorkeling, I wiped off the lens a few times with my finger just prior to taking above water pictures of turtles popping their heads up to get a breath of air and this worked fine.I purchased the accessory kit with different attachments to secure the camera.  I tried this while snorkeling, but personally found it unnecessary.  The wrist strap included with the camera was adequate for my needs.  I also purchased a floating wrist strap, and found it unnecessary this trip as well.  The attachments might come in handy for canoes, kayaks and boats or other activities when the camera could be kept handy but hands free.  The camera will sink - so be sure it is secure by whatever means you use.Based on some of the other comments, I was a bit concerned about the size of the camera before actually seeing it.  The camera is still small and portable - not quite like a cell phone sized point and shoot but still much smaller than some many other point and shoot cameras with higher optical zoom.  It easily fit in the pockets of my shorts.  After this trip, I am confident that I can carry this as a primary point and shoot camera without the concern of water damage in bad weather, and I look forward to trying it underwater again!", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Outdoors...beware indoors in some lighting situations", "Author": "Robert Stone", "ReviewID": "RKN482L9O55X2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a number of canon cameras [SD 550, SD 750, original Digital Rebel (300D), Rebel XSI] and purchased the D10 to take on vacations to beach, water parks etc. I received the camera in early November 2009 and pictures taken outdoors look great. The IS works well and I took a number of good pictures of our new puppy and my young kids (all of which have a tendency to move...darn it!) and pictures look good. Based on reviews here the camera went into the water in the sink almost right away to test the seals as others (from the number of postings this is rare) have had leaks that bricked their cameras. I had no problems there.What I did / do have a problem with is that with some types of fluorescent lighting (that in my kitchen, as it turns out) the pictures have an extremely yellow cast. Selecting white balance for fluorescent lighting did help some but problem seemed to return after several shots even still in that mode. Selecting over to that mode was also quite cumbersome and not something I wanted to do every time I happened to take a picture in my kitchen (which is where our puppy spends quite a bit of time, of course). Oddly, my older cameras noted above all deal with this lighting with automatic settings without problems.The issue was so severe that I actually returned the first camera I got in case it was an issue just with that unit. As it turns out, it appears to be design related. Oh well, I'll simply be sure to use a different camera in the kitchen - but if you intend to use this as not only an occasional camera but your primary camera you may wish to think twice or at least very carefully test it in all lighting conditions in and around your home. Incidentally, this was my first return to Amazon and true to their reputation it could not have been easier. I will keep the replacement camera as it should work well for outdoors / beach / water parks etc. I had hoped to use it as a extra fairly small camera for indoor shots but I no longer plan to use it that way.As a side note, if you get this be sure to re-assign the \"printer\" button to switch to movie mode if you use it for video - the instructions for doing this are buried in the book but this is MUCH easier than selecting mode button, clicking right twice and hitting set.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera for action & adventure, not so much for daily life.", "Author": "California Person", "ReviewID": "R2LVVTKLDHI2MX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you get into the water at the beach, snorkel, ski, snowboard, participate in other cold weather activities, or if you just tend to drop things, this is a good camera and does what it was intended, and does it well.

It will not take wide-angle photos and its standard telephoto is limited to 3x.  Since the lens is tucked inside a durable housing, that limits what the lens can do.  The settings are somewhat limited, but that is anticipated in a point-and-shoot camera.  Raw images would have been nice and a little more manual control is always nice.  However, it is a point-and-shoot for a reason.

It took good pictures around town while in Sydney plus it was easy to carry and portable. I used it constantly for the 3 1/2 weeks of our trip and love the camera so far.I originally looked into getting a waterproof housing for my Canon Powershot, but couldn't find one exactly right and they were very expensive. We were just going to do some snorkeling, not diving, so didn't need something for deep underwater. I liked the D10 because it was rated for 10 meters instead of 3 so you could feel safe swimming down to things well below the surface without worry if you are too deep.Once we got to the reef, just jumped in and started taking pictures. The screen was bright and easy to see under the water. I was careful to turn it off between shots if I wasn't constantly snapping away, so we never had any problems with the battery life. (I saw this on a few reviews before my purchase, so I was careful.) It has such a quick start time that I never felt that I was going to miss something. I also turned off the picture review to save the battery. This also allowed me to take my next photo much quicker since you didn't have to wait for the review before the camera went back to \"live\". The pictures were fantastic, I uploaded a few to the customer picture gallery. I couldn't have been happier with the photos and beats those disposable cameras, hands down!Once you get out of the ocean, very important to soak or thoroughly rinse the camera to remove the salt. Our boat had a fresh water bin to soak/rinse the cameras as you got out of the ocean. Also be sure to let completely dry (and may want to use a puff blower over the battery cover as water likes to stay in some small spots there) before you open the battery cover or usb cover. I also took the extra precaution to blow off (with the puff blower like you use for your digital SLR) the edges of the seals of each compartment before closing them to ensure no dust or sand might be hiding there. No sense in taking a risk like that.Changing between the scene modes was very easy, but usually not necessary. When shooting sunset or evening photos, the camera would automatically change to sunset mode for you and enrich those great colors. I also used the aquarium mode, which was a nice option since it changed the light balance and ensured no flash to ruin your photos. Mostly I left it on Auto and let the camera do all of the work. You don't need to think about anything, just shoot away and let it take great photos for you.I accidentally tested the shockproof feature of the camera one day. I hadn't put the strap on my wrist and was carrying some other things in my hand. I dropped the camera from about shoulder height to the cement with no damage and only a small scratch!One small drawback is the small optical zoom. I understand it, especially since the lens can't extend but it would have been nice at times to have a more closeup shot. With 12MP, I feel I can crop the photos a bit when necessary without too much worry since I mostly post them to the web. There is still plenty of resolution left. (My Nikon D70 SLR is only 6MP.)Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera.

Before buying, I spent about six months learning as much as I could about the pros and cons of the best compact waterproof cameras on the market (including the Panasonic TS1 and Olympus 8000) before deciding on this one--and I am more than pleased that I did! However, I had the luxury of not only reading other people's experience with the cameras and various comparison reviews out there, but also some first hand knowledge since my neighbor has had the Olympus 8000 for several months, and the ability to play around with the TS1 and D10 side by side at Fry's Electronics.During our cruse, we used the camera from the tops of Myan ruins in the middle of the jungle, to the shallow sea floor along the reefs surrounding Roatan, Cozumel and Grand Cayman. The ease of use of this camera is second to none--if you're going underwater, select underwater mode; if you're taking pictures of flowers and such, select foliage mode; if youre taking pictures of people on the beach, select beach mode...etc. The color accuracy, especially concerning colors underwater and plantlife is GREAT--and not just for a compact camera, I mean PERIOD! Blues are really blue and greens are really green--very vibrant, saturated colors--not washed out like I'm used to seeing with all the other underwater cameras I have used. The only real drawback is the shape--it's not exactly a throw-in-your-pocket-and-go camera, a bit bulkier than most compacts, but it's shape actually helps underwater and in wet conditions.Oh, and battery life really isn't an issue, Consumer Reports says it only has a 220 shot battery life, but I can attest that it'll last closer to 400, as long as you don't have the LCD screen on the whole time.Best camera I have owned so far!", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "I've been waiting for this camera", "Author": "M.

But for others -- like me thus far -- it's a lemon.  I bought D10 #1 a year ago, primarily for UW photos while snorkeling on the surface during Hawaiian vacations.  #1 flooded during our third snorkeling session. I was shocked!! I have used a Minolta Weathermatic film UW camera during many snorkeling sessions over ten years with no problems.  And the D10, with just two tiny doors for me to worry about -- battery port and A/V port -- has much less extensive seals than the Minolta.  I am VERY CAREFUL to ensure that doors are properly closed. Canon customer service responded well as always and quickly sent me a new D10. Unfortunately by the time it arrived our 2011 vacation was about over. I used it a few times for non-UW shots before our 2012 vacation, and it started to display the dreaded \"lens error -- restart\" message. Initially I could restart it, but when we got to Hawaii this year it refused to restart. Thus for the second year in a row, I spent some vacation time shipping the D10 back to Canon. Once again Canon promptly responded by replacing the optical assembly and returning the camera. That solved the \"lens error\" problem, but on our first snorkel session with the repaired camera, it shut down after 20 minutes. A careful check later at our vacation unit showed that there was moisture inside the screen!! I tried unsuccessfully to get it to work by drying it out. Once again I devoted vacation time to shipping the D10 back to Canon. They replaced it with a refurbished D10 this time. Since our vacation was about over, I had Canon ship it to our home. The D10 seems to work ok based on a couple of non-UW test shots, and I expect that I will once again try it when we snorkel on our next vacation.

I really like my 880 IS. And despite the great reviews for the housing, you have to admit that it's a $150 piece of plastic that does only 1 thing. For some more money, I thought it made more sense to have a waterproof camera that also could serve as a backup.Took a few test shots just to get used to the settings and the camera, and they turned out fine. The real test was the manta ray scuba dive, and my wife took it down to 35 or 36 feet, which is 10% more than the recommended 33 feet. It kind of made me nervous as I heard her say she went that low, but those Canon engineers clearly know what they are doing. The camera worked like a champ! After setting it to underwater mode, the pictures (plus sound!) came out beautifully! The other people on our dive boat were amazed and asked if we would share the still pictures and videos with them. We quickly became the envy of the dive. I also took it to Kealakekua Bay, watching dolphins and tropical fish in the bright sunlight (but underwater) and once again, the results were fantastic. You can zoom in/out while you take video with this camera, and I know some cameras do not allow that. If the camera suspects someone may have blinked during the shot, it will display a small icon as you review the picture. I found this feature surprisingly accurate. The camera will turn the LCD screen on in playback mode, if you press and hold the play button. (Other Canon cameras probably do this, but I discovered this by just playing around with the D10 one day.)What's also great about this camera is that it's good for everyday use. The D10 has auto vs. program modes as well as the usual special ones like portrait, sunset, indoor, etc. and it's a 12 MP camera! (My 880 IS is only 10 MP.) The macro function also worked very nicely as I strolled around one of the botanical gardens in Hilo, taking good close-ups of the flowers. The strap has a unique feature where you can move and replace it at any of the 4 corners of the camera.Buy a big memory card if you want to take this underwater, because you'll want to mix the still pictures with video and we quickly started to run out of room. The minimum I would recommend is 4G. Also, it was hard to find a good camera case because this camera's lens does not collapse flat. It's got 1 shape (which I totally understand since it needs to stay sealed.) I took the camera to different stores just to make sure it would fit, and ended up with a basic one that I purchased from Target, but about 80% of the camera cases could NOT fit this camera, so be careful on this part.Otherwise, I consider this money extremely well spent and hope you will, too.

Not having to mess with taking it in and out of a huge bulky housing every time seemed like a dream come true.Unfortunately, it doesn't really last as a WATERPROOF camera. I'd say it's water resistant.I used it on a 2-week science course in the rainforest through super-humid conditions and lots of downpours--it worked well despite focus problems, which were especially noticeable on the macro setting. I used it on the beach and it was fine. I even used it snorkeling a couple of times and it worked well (again, with focus problems). However, the third time it inexplicably took on water and just stopped working. I followed all the directions, and tested it in small amounts of water before taking it out every time, so I assume it was a manufacturer defect. I live in Africa and by the time I went back to the states to send it to Canon for service, they said it was out of warranty and I'd have to pay over $200 to fix it.

I have a 40D DSLR with a number of lens that I normally shoot with.  But I knew we'd be in the pools and ocean and wanted a camera that I could use by the water without worrying about it.  Because of the mixed reviews concerning the camera leaking water, I bought the Squaretrade 3 year warranty just to cover any problems.I got it a month before the trip and spent a few weeks playing with it around out house, taking pictures of the kids in our pool, etc.  The pictures looked really good and the under water shots were a lot of fun.  It's no replacement for the 40D, but it serves a different purpose.The camera performed flawlessly in Cancun.  I got a ton of great pictures (and movies) of everyone.  Some pictures turned out better than others, but overall the camera does a really good job in getting a good picture given the lighting conditions.  Everyone was thankful that I was able to take pictures as a number of them forgot their cameras and some had camera malfunctions while we were there.  I only had one incident (on the last night of the trip) where it seemed that maybe water had gotten into the camera.  But it has worked fine ever since, so I'm not sure what was going on that night (it was a very humid night, so that could have contributed to the problem I saw).This summer we just returned from a family vacation in Daytona Beach, FL.  Again, the camera performed flawlessly.  I got pictures of the kids on the beach, in the resort's lazy river and in the ocean.  And the movies the camera took of us playing in the ocean are great.So far (knock on wood) I've really had no problems.1) You MUST read the manual and follow the directions to ensure the camera stays water tight.  When I took it in the ocean, I put it in a glass of water overnight after rinsing it, just to be sure the saltwater got off of it.2) I had read that some users had problems with water and the USB hatch, so I have never connected a USB cable to the camera - I always open the battery/SD door and take out the SD card to dump the pictures.  This works pretty well because I almost always have to swap the battery at the same time.3) This camera really goes through the battery, so be sure to buy an extra one so you always have a charged one ready to swap in.4) Be very careful in closing the battery/SD card hatch and make sure there is no sand or dirt around the rubber gasket before you close the door.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Failure underwater", "Author": "Jaf", "ReviewID": "R35ENZMPCG6263", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Daughter saved and saved for this camera.

I like Canon Cameras; I've owned many of them: film SLRs, digital SLRs (Rebel XT, XTi, 7D), point-and-shoots and camcorders (currently a Vixia HF20). In addition to my DSRL (Canon 7D), I wanted a waterproof camera to take in my Caribbean vacation, for all the boat rides and snorkeling. So the D10 seemed a natural choice, particularly after reading so many good reviews. However, I am a bit disappointed with this camera.First, the things I like about it:- Waterproof to about 10 meters, which is more than most similar cameras allow. I only used it while snorkeling, and it worked nicely.- Good quality, very rugged, although mine already has a few scratches in it. Anyway, it is a good beach camera, you can toss it around, drop it in the sand and just wash it off.- The design is interesting, I like the different latching options, but it is a bit heavy, bulky and awkward. I bought it together with a case recommended by Amazon, and it didn't fit!- The LCD screen is nice, but you can't really see much underwater.- It has many nice features and picture modes, so you have a nice degree of control (for a point-and-shoot): P mode is adequate for most situations, and there's an underwater mode.- Battery life is OK. I took two extra batteries in my trip, but they weren't really necessary.Cons:- The shutter lag is annoying. It's very slow.- Image quality is not that great: very noisy pictures in higher ISO settings, white balance seems always a bit off, images come out with a yellow tint.- Video quality is mediocre. The 640x480 video is way behind what you get with any other camera.In sum, I was disappointed by the camera's major shortcomings: photos were just OK, and video was not even that. Canon could do much better than this.In the end, I managed to get great snorkeling videos - with my Vixia camcorder and a Dicapac waterproof bag!-----Update, six months later: The more I use it, the less I like it :)Can't give it more than 2 stars...Any cheap mobile phone can shoot better videos than this camera.

The cameras I've owned since childhood range from film SLRs to digital SLRs to point-and-shoots; actually I still have a Canon PowerShot SD630 with a whopping 6.0 megapixels LOL that will spank the D10 any day of the week.  Review will also be a summary since there are plenty of very good reviews out there.Pros:- Waterproof- Quality build- Nice design with multiple latching points- Large LCD- Lightweight- Feature-richCons:- Slooowwwww!!  Suffers greatly from shutter lag- White balance inadequate: Yellow tint for most indoor shots- A little bulky, definitely will not fit in your back pocket- Another slooowww!  Frame rate per second leaves a lot to be desired.Others:I would give this camera a 3.5 stars but Amazon does not allow 1/2 stars.  Overall it's decent for a point-and-shoot except for the terrible shutter lag and the dismal auto white balance.  Still very useful if you're on the beach for summer vacation and don't want to lug around your usual 50D + 24-70mm f/2.8L + with battery grip.

It seems ALL of them had mixed reviews. I decided on Canon because I have 2 other Canons that work good. This camera was purchased in time for a trip we were taking to Cabo.  I wanted to test it out before taking it on vacation just in case.  We used in the pool and took a few shots, rinsed it off when we went back to the room, towel dried it and let it air dry. We had no problems with leakage or anything for that matter. If you are going to use it for those perfect vacation (underwater) photos,  you need to make sure you read the instruction manual, and get a chance to play with the different SCENE modes.  The underwater mode adds a little bit of color so you don't want to use that mode out of water.  Once the modes were set I could let my 6 and 8 year old boys use the camera with no worries that they would drop it or mess it up.  Even if dropped in the sand you could just pick up and and rinse it off. The video mode is also great.  We used it while on vacation for 7 days and didn't need to charge it every night, the battery seemed to last pretty good.  I believe that as long as you take care of it per manufacturers instructions, it should last you quite a long time.  Rinse it in fresh water following immersion with ocean water or pool water.

There are several cameras out there which are 'underwater', but this seemed to be the only one with max F-stop at 2.8. All the rest were from 3.5. And under the water you need much more light to take the pictures at the same ISO, so the max aperture was the main reason I chose this very camera among the rest, and this pro outweight all the cons. The price is a little bit high compared to others, but the difference is about 60-70 USD. The other cons: a little bit bulkier than others, and the LCD screen is not high resolution and bright enough to see what picture you are taking under water, especially when you are also wearing goggles.P.S.

The reef shots were very detailed after a little lighting adjustment on Photoshop perfect hue and the big screen and button made it easy to use under water. The above water holiday shots had that slightly over saturated look that most compacts lean towards but not a problem for us - some purists may not like. I prefer detail capture over saturation so I don't have to be too accurate in framing and can crop/expand later. The D10 was perfect for this as a lifeless reef shot from 10m away produced some amazing sharp fish close ups when blown up on the PC.

It has been underwater in Key West, with manatees in Crystal River, FL, in waves in the Gulf of Mexico, and in hot tubs, pools, waterfalls, showers, bath tubs, and in the rain! It also goes everywhere to take pictures when I am NOT under water. ;-)  It is easy to use, has very good battery life, and is shock resistant so I do not worry about it.  My 6 year old niece loves using it too, and takes great pictures with it.  Software is super easy to load, and you just plug USB cord from camera to computer to upload pictures from camera to computer.  Features are great.  Love black and white, sepia, and color accent features.  Sunset, kid/pets, and night scene are modes I use a lot.With all my cameras in the past, I had to worry about not taking my camera in kayaks, canoes, or to the beach, or had to risk ruining the camera if I did take it.  Now this camera goes everywhere.  It has a cool \"submarine\" look.  My brother bought one after I loved mine so much. We bought an accessory kit (which I would definitely recommend even though it is expensive) and put the camo color panel on his to replace the bright blue. The accessory kit also has optional carry straps which I have found to be useful, and a cool neoprene case.Everybody asks me about this camera--where can they get one, and so on.  I would highly recommend it.  A few \"cons\" or suggestions:  1) I am very careful with the seals, and never open the battery compartment or USB door if camera is damp, or if I am outside near dirt or sand.  2) This camera is not as tiny as some, which was a drawback for me.  However, it gets far better reviews as far as picture quality than any of the other waterproof cameras I have seen or heard about, and I have not been at all disappointed with my choice! It fits easily into a purse or backpack of course, you don't even feel it.  It just isn't tiny enough to fit comfortably into a pocket.  3) It only has a 3.0 x optical zoom.  This was a drawback for me.  However, the photo quality is amazing to me even with digital zoom to 12.0 x.  (Probably would not be if blowing up big enlargements.)  4) Flash is too bright to me when close up.  Really wish it had a soft flash, or half flash.  However, camera takes photos without flash in all but the lowest light.  5) Battery life is great.  However, it doesn't give you much notice about battery being low before it goes completely dead.

I am an avid snorkeler when I go on vacations, and I have tried other methods of capturing my underwater adventures (disposable underwater cameras were ok, but no image stabilization and no video, and the Dicapac bag enclosure made my camera lose lots of its functions,including the LCD screen!). So, this time I splurged on this camera, and could not be any happier. Like other reviewers, I didn't know the great pictures this camera would take outside of the water (it is a Canon after all), so I brought two cameras with me on vacation, the D10, and my older Canon 890. I could have just stuck with the D10 the entire time, because it was able to take quality pictures in all situations. Fantastic videos, great image stabilization for those active fish, and the ability to be bumped around a bit. It got some scratches from being used, mostly because it does not float and got bumped around rocks in the water. Still worked like a charm. I never opened any of the compartments until the camera was completely dry, as I didn't want to take any chances on water getting in there. I loved the underwater setting, it picked up the colors perfectly. This is a setting my 890 doesn't have, of course, so even with an underwater housing for it, I don't think it would have captured things as beautifully as the D10. Don't hesitate to buy if you want amazing underwater footage of your adventures, or if you just want a camera that you aren't scared to get wet or bumped around a little. I swear, this thing got scratched on rocks, got buried in sand, even got lightly stepped on by my flipper...and it did not stop functioning. Perfect for the adventurer.As another reviewer mentioned, this camera does not do well with the transition from water to land. You will have some water spots in your pics if you are directly coming from the water, and it does take the lens a while to completely dry off afterwards on its own.

I thought it would be nice to have a waterproof camera for underwater shots as well as not having to worry about it getting sand on it or it bouncing around when it hit the water, etc.I did my research and none of the current options jumped out at me as the clear winner. The Canon was in the lead for me because it had better picture quality. But, it was large and has an absurdly priced accessory kit. What I thought I wanted was one of the many next generation models, especially from Panasonic, as I really like my DMC-TZ5. But, all of the new models were being released in April... one month too late! After reading so many reviews about all of the cameras leaking, I was hesitant, but I needed something, so I bought the Canon D10.On paper, it's specs put it in the middle to the end of the pack. 3X optical zoom, \"large\" camera body. VGA video. Certainly nothing to drool over. But, its water proof rating is to 10m/33ft, while many of the competitors were only good to 1/3 that.It performed admirably during our 6 days in Cancun. It was the first time I had a camera with me while on the beach and in the ocean and pool without having to even worry about it. I got pictures that I would have never been able to before. And, most importantly, it didn't leak at all. I was VERY cautious about making sure the battery/memory card door's rubber seals were perfectly clean, etc.I also completed my scuba certification while in Cancun, but I didn't take the camera with me. First, I didn't need any more distractions while learning the ropes of basic diving techniques. And, while we only dove to 30 feet, I didn't want to take the camera down to its advertised limits, since Canon doesn't stand behind its waterproof rating in its warranty. ANY water damage is NOT covered. That makes no sense to me. How can a company state that a camera is waterproof to a certain depth and yet not back up that claim in their warranty? But, it is, what it is, so I didn't take the chance when I went diving.I would recommend this camera, as it does take pretty good pictures (for a waterproof point and shoot). But, I would encourage everyone to consider the latest generation of waterproof/rugged cameras first. I'm sure the price of the D10 will drop as the next generation models are released, so if cost is a concern, you should definitely consider the D10. Just skip the $130 accessory kit.

I just got the D10 today, I had it shipped to my work so that I could get it earlier in the day!  I had all ready purchased an Maximal Power DB CAN NB-6L Replacement Battery and a car charger so I would have a fully charged battery to play with.  Turns out that the Canon battery has some charge all ready on it so I didn't need the other battery right away.Taking it out of the package I was very impressed with how well put together it is and how solid it feels.  I have had many of the Canon Powershot cameras starting with the S210 way back in 2003.  This is the 4th camera in the Powershot series that I have owned.  From my initial take this is really a good camera.  Due to the waterproofing it feels very solid and seems to be well made.  Since the camera is more rounded they were able to place buttons in areas that are easier to reach such as the zoom and zoom out buttons are now on the screen side of the camera and are easier to manipulate then on my SD750.  It also seems that they beefed up the brightness of the screen due to the fact that this camera is meant to be used outdoors more then most cameras.  I was only able to take a few test shots so I can comment too much on the most important feature of the camera but from the few random test shots in bright sunlight it seemed to do very well.March 16th 2009:Well we got the camera to the pool to put it through it's paces.  The pool has large indoor kids play area with water slides and stuff to play on.  We got a fair amount of light in from the windows so we could take some shots without the flash if we were on that side of the pool.  Before going in the water I opened both doors and visualy inspected the seals for any foreign substances that might make the seal not work properly.  I plan to do this everytime we use it in the water to be 100% sure that we don't have any leakage issues.  I would venture a guess that most people that have had their camera leak ended up with a small hair or other foreign material on the seal.  I was really happy at how well the flash worked on the D10.  I do have a SD450 that I bought a waterprrof enclosure for but I could never get the flash to work like it should.  Since this camera is not that bulky the flash worked very well.I was also impressed with the scene modes.  I had a few issues with non flash indoor shots until I switched it to the indoor scene mode, at that point my pictures looked much better without the flash.  Controls are easy to use, I like where the zoom keys are it is just taking me a while to get oriented to which button does the zooming.  My wife was a litte bit skeptical that we needed another camera but she is a big believer now that we have it.Monday March 22:Wow the 3200 ISO Scene mode is really amazing!  I took some low light shots of my sons while there were napping that were really amazing given the low amount of light in their room.  I also used the fireworks mode to take a few shot of a cars on the highway.  These turned out really nice and show how well this camera adapts to what you want to do with it.  Yes it is an undewater camera but it can do so much more then just get wet.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "I really loved this... until water ruined it!", "Author": "Skai", "ReviewID": "R3RDGVKG87LAL1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm so sad... as I really loved this camera. That was before the battery compartment somehow came open and sea water got in and ruined it completely.I bought this camera in August 2009 and took it with me on diving and snorkeling trips to Bonaire, Hawaii, and Thailand. The camera features were great and it was extremely easy to use. I also loved taking videos of my underwater adventures. All in all, I would have been the first to give this a 5 star rating.However, one day of snorkeling I had the camera out and realized it didn't work. I popped up above the waves and saw the battery compartment open, my battery gone, and water in both the LCD screen and lens. Aaaargh!!! I had to buy those crappy disposable waterproof cameras for the rest of my trip, which resulted in with almost-worthless photos.I counted all the times I went into the water and realized the door seal had failed on the 14th day of use. That's just not cool. I'm trying to get a refund via my Visa, as Canon says \"water damage is not under warranty\" and Amazon doesn't take returns after 30 days.I'd really suggest you get a waterproof case and just use a cheap digital camera instead.-----UPDATED 10/18/10I'm bumping this from a 2-star to a 3-star, as I was able to get the camera replaced by Canon (so yay for customer service).HOWEVER, please note that this brand new camera got its microphone damaged after a 2 week scuba diving trip to Fiji and Australia. There's now NO audio for my videos. As almost all of my videos are underwater where audio is unnecessary, I guess that's okay.

You do need to be careful since the lens and back screen are always exposed so I used my old A70 case to transport my D10.

The button layout is slightly different than other powershot cams but you get used to it really quick!  The video and photo came out very, you can even use the flash underwater and it provides some decent detail on close subjects like coral.The wrist strap that comes with this camera is sturdy and has an adjuster knob so you can tighten so it wont fall off!!

I really like my 880 IS. And despite the great reviews for the housing, you have to admit that it's a $150 piece of plastic that does only 1 thing.  For some more money, I thought it made more sense to have a waterproof camera that also could serve as a backup.Took a few test shots just to get used to the settings and the camera, and they turned out fine. The real test was the manta ray scuba dive, and my wife took it down to 35 or 36 feet, which is 10% more than the recommended 33 feet.  It kind of made me nervous as I heard her say she went that low, but those Canon engineers clearly know what they are doing.  The camera worked like a champ!  After setting it to underwater mode, the pictures (plus sound!) came out beautifully!  The other people on our dive boat were amazed and asked if we would share the still pictures and videos with them.  We quickly became the envy of the dive.  I also took it to Kealakekua Bay, watching dolphins and tropical fish in the bright sunlight (but underwater) and once again, the results were fantastic.  You can zoom in/out while you take video with this camera, and I know some cameras do not allow that.  If the camera suspects someone may have blinked during the shot, it will display a small icon as you review the picture.  I found this feature surprisingly accurate.  The camera will turn the LCD screen on in playback mode, if you press and hold the play button.  (Other Canon cameras probably do this, but I discovered this by just playing around with the D10 one day.)What's also great about this camera is that it's good for everyday use.  The D10 has auto vs. program modes as well as the usual special ones like portrait, sunset, indoor, etc. and it's a 12 MP camera!  (My 880 IS is only 10 MP.)  The macro function also worked very nicely as I strolled around one of the botanical gardens in Hilo, taking good close-ups of the flowers.  The strap has a unique feature where you can move and replace it at any of the 4 corners of the camera.Buy a big memory card if you want to take this underwater, because you'll want to mix the still pictures with video and we quickly started to run out of room.  The minimum I would recommend is 4G.  Also, it was hard to find a good camera case because this camera's lens does not collapse flat.  It's got 1 shape (which I totally understand since it needs to stay sealed.)  I took the camera to different stores just to make sure it would fit, and ended up with a basic one that I purchased from Target, but about 80% of the camera cases could NOT fit this camera, so be careful on this part.Otherwise, I consider this money extremely well spent and hope you will, too.

I found the shutter delay and start up to be quite slow.  I missed a lot of shots.  I thought the Canon D10 was a great camera but not perfect and of course being the photo fanatic I am I carry it everywhere.  I had a chance to test some features such as the waterproof,  freeze-proof and shock proof but it was protected in the case.  I operated well at 26 degrees Centigrade with the snow and ice. There were no camera problems after a protected light fall.  Also it continue to operate after getting wet from the rain and the snow.  It has fast start up and a short shutter delay which enables you to get those quick shots.  The time between or delay between shots could be improved.  I found it difficult at times to catch action shots or movement from animals without some blur but I think I need to work with the camera a little more or ask the dogs to stop and pose for me.  I did some outdoor landscape shots and was pleasantly surprised.  If you want action photography we are talking about using an SLR for best performance with a quick lens.  If you want a shorter delay between pictures and when actuating your shutter you also need an SLR. Also the camera had a high ISO of 3200 which really helped with those low light shots and made the photograph look brighter in darker conditions.  Of course the only drawback was the noise or a grainier look.. In regards to the accessory kit I could only use two of the included items and they were the camera case and the neck strap.  The attachments for the wrist strap and the neck strap were a little too proprietary for me.  I would have liked an attachment adapter so that you could attach  another type of neck strap.  The case worked well but I would have liked a place for extra media and battery.  The neck strap was a little awkward and I had a little difficulty in getting to lie flat on my chest but it did work and was waterproof.  The next strap and wrist attachment to the cameras' four ports was secure, reliable, and was without fault.  Overall it is a great back up, hiking and/or outdoor activity camera which does water like snorkeling.

I wanted an underwater camera  and I trusted Canon because of my previous experience with their cameras.  Unfortunately, this particular model of theirs was absolutely HORRIBLE!When we first bought the camera, we had only used it a couple of times outside of the water.  Then in May 2011, we finally had an oportunity to use it under water.  It worked for a little while but then stopped.  The LCD screen would not display an image.  When we returned home, we sent the camera in for repair to Canon as it was still under waranty.Canon repaired the camera and sent it back to us.We had not used the camera again after receiving it back from repair until we went on vacation on August 1, 2011.After 2-3 pictures, the camera stopped working again.  It was the same issue! The LCD screen would not display an image and the camera didn't appear to even turn back on.  I could not tell whether it was on or not, if it was on, whetheraa it was in picture or video mode mode, nor what the settings were because the viewfinder LCD screen was just black.We couldn't take pictures of our vacation with it so we had to buy a disposable and that thing took horrible pictures.  So we were left with the choice of horrible pictures of our vacation or NO pictures of our vacation because we could not use our Canon camera!We sent the camera in to Canon again for repair. Canon \"fixed\" the camera again (2nd time) and sent it back to us.  Since then, the camera does not work.  We have the same problem with it.  After getting it back the second time, it took a couple of 2-3 pictures (not even under water) and then the LCD screen went black and it would not display an image, the settings, nothing.We haven't bothered to send it in for repair again.

The truth is, you're always taking a risk when buying waterproof cameras. I've owned an Olympus, Panasonic, and FujiFilm, and they have all failed on me between 3 months and 1 year.

In fact, read the manual and you'll find that some of them actually state that the seal will deteriorate in about a year!Anyway, on to this camera. So far after about month of heavy usage (>1000 pics), I've found this Canon to take the best pictures of the four waterproof cameras I've owned. I've taken my cameras hiking in rainforests, laying at the beach, skiing, and playing around the pool with my kids so I'm very experienced with them. Here are my initial thoughts on the Canon D10:PROS- Pictures are very crisp for this category (sub-$500 waterproof)- Not great in low light but also the best in this category; more than adequate in most outdoor situations- Waterproof up to 33ft is nice even though I won't go down that deep; it means that it's likely better at holding pressure (and keeping water out) than the cameras that go up to 10ft- Easy to use and very intuitive, just like any Canon- Love that I can connect the strap in any of the four corners of the camera; I like the strap on one side when taking landscapes but I prefer it on the other side when taking self picsCONS- Battery/SD compartment is secure but doesn't have an extra safety lock like other cameras (e.g. Panasonic Lumix); not a problem if you're careful and ensure it's completely closed- Very bulky - no way I would use this as my everyday camera since I can't slide it in my pocket without it creating a bulge since this camera is deeper (length and height are a little long too) than any compact that I've ever used- Wish it came with a rubber shell (i.e. Panasonic Lumix) that I can put on when I need to; I can see this camera taking a beating on its shiny caseOVERALLI love this camera for what I intend to use it for, outdoor and underwater pics (namely places where I don't bring my SLR). Hoping this lasts me over a year!

Being on the water, under the water and in the water is an integral part of our life. We use the Canon D110 almost exclusively any time we are in our dinghy or out snorkeling. The pictures that we get are very high quality and the images from the D110 that we use on our blog rival those taken by our Nikon D300 at screen resolutions.The battery life of this camera is amazing and even more so considering the clarity of the LCD which is truly bright and direct sunlight viewable. When we are in the water, we leave the camera on all the time so we can literally point and shoot. Other cameras we've used had such limited battery life that we had to turn them off between shots if we wanted to use it for more than an hour. With the Canon we've left it on for well over an hour and there is still plenty of life in the battery. Just in case however we always carry a fully charged spare.The underwater mode does a good job of filtering out the blue, so the tone of the images appear natural and pleasing. The dynamic range could use a little work, but under water the conditions are pretty harsh so contrast is more extreme than on land. Used as a normal surface point and shoot the images are fine.There have been comments about the bulkiness of the D110 and while it isn't as easy to carry in our pocket as our Nikon S3, in the water, which was the whole point of the camera in the first place, the bulk actually makes it easier to hold and manipulate the controls. Macro mode works well so our coral pics are great.We have completed a full year using this camera and there have been no major issues with it so far. There is a little pitting around the strap ring, but that is likely due to being in a salty environment all the time. We noticed the corrosion early on, and have been more careful about rinsing it with fresh water after diving and the situation seems to have stabilized.

I researched this carefully before purchasing. Actually I was waiting for the $299.00 price to drop but it never moved. As I was going to Calabria, Italy  an every August trip) and wanted to take photos under water. The sea there is very clear and I have seen fish multiple times before but as I need corrective lenses to see underwater and I needed a camera that was waterproof, I carefully research both. I purchased Hilco goggles with a corrective lens insert and the Canon D10. I must be honest - Being a Nikon guy, I wanted a NIKON equivalent but none was available. I would have preferred NIKON with \"RAW\" capabilities, as I am a D300 user. I read the D10 positive reviews as well as the negatives. There seemed to be several who complained about water leakage, so I was hesitant. So I waited until the last minute before leaving for Calabria. I decided to take a chance and bought the Canon D10.I was very impressed with the camera. The corrective lens in the HILCO mask was great. It allowed me to see what I could not before. My best photos were of Jelly fish. They were high quality. I did find that even setting the camera to underwater \"white balance\", I still needed to use software to adjust the colors. However, that was no issue for me, and the clarity was amazing - We could detect the tentacles and the \"stinging cells\".I was a bit paranoid about the negative reviews stating water leakage. After each use, I religiously dried the camera first, removed the SD card, dried the door latch to be certain there was no moisture, double-checked that each of the closing latches were really closed, and put the camera in a bucket of Tap Water for several hours. I dried the camera carefully to get it ready for the next day's use. On one day's use, I kind of panicked because I noted moisture that appeared on the inside of the viewing screen. I was terribly afraid that those negative reviews were actually correct. After taking every precaution, why was there this moisture appearing? Was I going to experience a $300 loss? Back at home base, I opened the battery and SD card compartment and allowed it to sit in the sun hoping the moisture, if present, would escape (It is hot in Calabria). Whether that helped or not, I do not know, but the next day's pictures were great also. It is still working well, and I think the pictures taken on land were of high quality. So much so, that I think it takes better photos than my SD980. I carry the portables in my pocket when traveling anywhere -- for that opportune photo -- Hard to put a D300 in your pocket.Yes, the D10 has some bulkiness but I also bought the \"Chums\" wrist band that allowed for my ease of keeping the camera floating. It is somewhat bulkier than my SD980, but that may be the price of having something that is waterproof.

One year later (summer 2011) I was back in St. John  camera in hand.  Once again -- it was great fun --  for sure the D10 is not a professional level camera -- but it gets good shots underwater.  Then on the 8th day of my vacation -- the camera leaked.  I could see water in the view mode (the screen you look at to take photos) -- and it would not take a photo.  It was just full of water.  I was lucky in that I quickly got the memory chip out -- and when I got home I was able to salvage most of the underwater photos I had taken.So this great little camera has a real flaw.  For $290 it should work more than one season -- but it didn't-- it leaked and stopped working.  I'm going to send it back to Canon and see what they do.

In the time she did have it we used it while boating on the lake, and in our pool.  The camera functioned flawlessly.  The images were crystal clear, sharp and vibrant.  The videos were also excellent.  I'm a photographer with much more expensive equipment and I am impressed with the image quality of this little camera.

I am so  impressed that like I said, I just re-ordered another one for her to replace the washed away camera.My only complaint is that, like most other digital waterproof cameras it doesn't float.  I have an older Canon Elph, APS film camera that we used to take to the beach, lake and pool.  The entire camera floats!  I purchased it in 1998 and believe it or not it still works, and still has the original battery, keeps time and just keeps on going.  But the best part is it just floats forever.

I did not try video and only used it to about 12 feet in depth, but underwater, the shots were clear, the lighting seemed better than usual, the focus was good.  The macro shots were incredible.  I was able to get within 3\" of these really cool tube worms and get perfect shots. The battery life was pretty good, too.  It ran out after about 5 hours, (although I did not have the power on continuously). Above water, picture quality was just as good.  I took many pictures of my kids jumping off a platform into the water, or throwing things in the air, and the camera caught the action perfectly.  It was very easy to use.  I did soak it each evening in fresh water as directed and had no problem with leaks.  My only small nits (3):  1. Like many other reviewers, I don't understand why there is no lens cover when the power is off.  Because of that, I constantly had sunscreen fingerprints or other debris on the lens, especially if my kids were handling the camera.  If I was in the water when this happened, I didn't have any means to clean the lens.  2. I did not like the light from the flash underwater--it seemed to lend an odd color cast to my pics.  Not a big deal because the camera worked well even in slightly dim conditions, so I just turned the flash off when underwater.  Above water, the flash was fine, but I do wish there was a manual means of turning the flash on (there is a manual \"flash off\" command), to counteract silhouette for example.  3. Although the camera itself is quite hardy, the finish could be hardier.  My 6 year old tested the hardiness of the case while scrambling around on rocks trying to photograph crabs.  The case came back very scratched.  I know that is a rough test for a camera, but a realistic one.

After some research this clearly was the front runner.  Now I know why.  It works very well, is very easy to use, and lives up to it's billing.We took a number of pictures underwater, mostly snorkeling on the surface.  In pretty bright sunlight we were able to get good pictures of barracuda that were at 10 feet below us.  Color was at least as good as what you are actually seeing, especially if you use the Underwater color setting.  The controls are very easy to use and make reasonably intuitive sense.  Colors on reef fish and sponges are representative of real life.  At one point we went scuba diving in a cave and got it down to about 20 feet.  Pictures came out blurry but that wasn't the camera's fault.  We were trying to take pictures of a moving small shrimp.  One thing to keep in mind is that when you are snorkeling/swimming you are not being completely still while you are taking the pictures.Also, the camera takes great pictures out of the water.  I was very happy with the regular quality.  It has a good combination of automatic and manual modes that allow you to over/underexpose picutres, change the light settings, and it also has manual focus capability.One thing I like is that the connector for the strap is actually a button that can be locked onto anyone of the four corners of the camera.  This allows you to move it around to fit the situation.  I would highly recommend a floating strap.  We got the one from Olympus and it will float the camera.  It also makes it easier to find and gives you a sense of comfort that you won't lose it.Good:1.  The camera actually is waterproof, at least down to 30 feet.2.  Picture quality is very good, both in and out of water.3.  Good combination of manual and automatic modes.4.  Battery life appears good.  I was able to get at least two full days of picture taking out of one charge.  I never ran the battery all the way down so I don't know what total life is.Could be better:1.  I agree with the reviewer that threads for filters would be useful.  There are some filters designed for underwater photography to bring out color that would be nice to use.2.  Uses a propretary battery and charger.  Although the battery seems to last a long time you have to make sure you have the correct charger with you.  Not a huge deal unless you leave it.  Also means you can't run into the drug store for more batteries if you get low.3.  Screen sometimes difficult to see underwater.  This can be an issue if you are trying to get a picture of a specific moving fish.  If they are not really bright and easy to see you may have trouble getting them centered the way you like.4.  Because of the design of the housing (which is a little bulky) you may have to work to find a case that fits.Bad:1.  Nothing.All in all I am very happy with this camera and recommend it highly.

Part of me ordered this camera thinking the product test shots had to be too good to be true, as I was replacing a Nikon Coolpix P5100, which was marketed as a \"pro-sumer\" camera, a distinction this camera doesn't have.To a certain extent, it does lack the little niceties of a camera aimed at a more camera-savvy market, mainly a full manual (or at least aperture-priority) mode. It looks like something Spongebob probably owns, and the lens doesn't retract, making it non-pocketable. I'm worried about the reviews that say it leaks, although I haven't experience this yet (fingers crossed) after several dunks in the pool and sink. But if inducing paranoia counts as a con, add that to the list. A complaint I've heard from friends I've handed it off to, although not one that bothers me too much personally, is that the on/off and shoot buttons are too similar in size/shape/location and it's easy to accidentally hit the wrong one. Vibration-reduction doesn't work as well as it did on my old Nikon. I'm not overly fond of the included wrist strap (waay too long), but now I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel for complaints.Overall, I'm really impressed with this camera. The \"Auto\" mode on this camera is a \"smart auto,\" meaning it can switch automatically between modes, such as portrait or macro, without a single button-press. It's really amazing how often it gets it right! For control freaks or camera geeks, P mode allows control over ISO, white balance, color mode (neutral, vivid, b&w;, custom, etc.), metering, single/continuous shooting, image quality, and size, and, most importantly, remembers these settings when the camera is turned off and on again. For situations when you're not sure quite how best to set up the camera, there are a number of scene modes as well. Using this camera for vacation, I experienced some problems with overexposure in the bright Florida sun, but putting it in P mode and turning the exposure compensation down a bit worked quite well for this. The camera also offers manual focus, which is an exciting little feature if you're shooting a fairly stationary subject and the camera can't seem to get the focus right on its own. Very slow to fiddle with if you're trying to shoot anything less stationary.Highlights: water rides? no problem!, bumping against sinks and walls while keeping the camera permanently attached to my wrist? no problem!, nice colors, nice creative controls, GREAT battery life (one battery seems to last through about a day and a half of very intense vacation-photo-taking or almost two weeks of normal intermittent daily use), macro mode works better than any other compact digital i've used, and fireworks mode made me very proud at Epcot while balancing the camera on a monopod fashioned out of a parasol balanced on a fence-rail, and, of course, lots of fun in the pool!Would recommend to: anyone with kids, vacationers, anyone fond of water, anyone looking for a worry-free take-everywhere camera.Would not recommend: if manual controls or size matter. image quality is very good, but not as good as higher-end models.

Bought this camera for family trips that tend to include water activities (and hopefully it won't die anytime soon). Wish this camera had RAW.I shot over 700 pics on recent lake trip. What I found:- camera is waterproof- used on P (not Auto) mode almost exclusively - I set the ISO to lower amount as the higher ISO pictures (that Auto often chose to shoot in) aren't worth bothering with - they have a ton of grain and poor color. I also found I needed to use exposure compensation typically at around -2/3rd stop to get rich colored pictures and not have a ton of blown out highlights. I am not sure why Canon likes to have its shots overexposed but my DSL has same tendency. If I had been using camera right out of the box in Auto mode (as I did at home for a couple weeks before the trip) I would be very disappointed with the resultant pictures (as I was). In Auto mode too many end up grainy, poor color, etc.- macro - works pretty well although item has to be fairly near center of picture - couldn't necessarily get it to focus where I wanted it to focus.- did shoot underwater but lake was cloudy so can't comment on underwater setting color- isn't great for low light action but does great in bright light- using flash for fill (forced flash mode) on bright days was a bit of a disaster - the flash was so bright even at 7' or so away that pictures look unreal. Unless I can figure out a way to turn flash down I won't be able to use it for fill. It does seem to do a decent job in darker light settings as flash (or does what you expect a small camera flash to do but at least correctly exposes main/centered subject).- movies - what you'd expect- I did buy an extra battery (based on other reviews) but didn't end up needing it on any one day despite a fair amount of shooting and movie taking and reviewing pictures each day.Good camera for outdoor wet activities - and children who drop things. Spend a little time with the manual and camera and you will improve your shots immeasurably - camera CAN take good pictures but won't necessarily without a little help.The camera is \"cute\" and my kids love the way the hand strap can be put on any of the 4 corners. You can't use a neck strap without buying another custom corner thingie to hang it from. Clever of Canon.

Rios Metcalf", "ReviewID": "RUK0YU2OUT8G4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for Christmas after drooling over it for a year or so.  The last time I had a point and shoot I was 16 and it had film in it.  I needed something to take where I didn't dare take my SLR but I wasn't willing to suffer in the picture quality department.  I've taken this camera everywhere.  I can give it to my students to take pictures with and not worry about them dropping it or spilling something on it (though I make sure they wear the wrist strap).  If I'd written this review just after Christmas it would have been positive but having used it extensively on vacation, in tide pools, on hikes and in the pool I'd very highly recommend it.  At first I was irritated by some of the auto settings (it tries to make each scene medium gray, as far as density/exposure).  However, when I played around with the Program mode I was able to adjust all of the little things that I was used to  having control over in my SLR, not as precisely but sufficiently for a point and shoot.  Figuring that out, I realized I could also use some of those things (exposure and white balance and manual focus among others) when shooting video.  I've had a great time shooting underwater video of minnows, trout, salamanders and friends.  The Macro feature is good but sometimes it rebels when the flowers wiggle in the breeze, I found placing my steady hand next to the flower and focusing on that works for a quick shot.  Otherwise I use the Manual Focus which lets you get pretty close, 2in away...  The pictures are of lovely quality, the auto white balance is good enough on most occasions.  However, as with any other camera I find it's best to choose a light situation for the camera otherwise it tries to make yellow sandstone white as if there were Tungsten light and that looks gross.  The underwater settings are great.  I've used them to create vivid color when the color isn't working in other situations too.  I was a color corrector at a big photography lab for years and I know that color can make or break a shot.  I also know it's better to not have to make too many changes after the fact.  I've been pleased with the accuracy of color and density and can often send pictures to print with no color correction requested.  Something I don't dare to do with my SLR.  On the other hand, I was recently taking a picture of a purple delphinium and everything was a fine color except the flower which the camera insisted on making a weird sapphire blue that it invented.  The camera is a little heavy for a cocktail purse or most ladies clothing pockets but otherwise it's fine.  The zoom is good but definitely only in comparison to point and shoot cameras.  I wouldn't take this on a bird watching trip as a substitute for an SLR camera though it does do better than other point and shoots in this department.  It takes a nice landscape though not as wide angle as I'm used to with my SLR.  It also takes lovely arm-out self-portraits.  The self-timer is fun to play with, you can set the custom timer for a 1-30 second delay and have it take 1-10 shots.  It's perfect for a silly picture series, family portrait, you riding your horse over a jump... all sorts of things.  It also takes good pretty dark shots, if you hold steady it can usually do a good job for you.  The 3200 setting helps, but it isn't usually necessary.  It's a great tool and the more I play with it the more I discover.  The pictures I've taken impress my family and friends because it's an awesome camera I've learned to use well.  They're all jealous I can drop, submerge, nearly freeze my camera, hand it to cookie dough covered second graders and then wash it off with a little soap and water.  Good to go again.

Ingalls", "ReviewID": "R2K42OW12WVBTK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Since I live in Hawaii, I bought this camera for its underwater feature. I had purchased a Fujifilm underwater camera the week before and it broke within 30 minutes. I consider Canon a great company with quality products so I decided I should just bite the bullet and get the Canon D10 instead.I used it underwater about 5 times shooting photos and video. They all turned out wonderfully and are great quality. It was easy to switch back and forth from picture to video, from underwater to beach mode.However, yesterday I took it to my favorite snorkeling spot and used it for about an hour. Afterward, in the car I wiped the lens down (I didn't want water droplets on my photos for the rest of the day). Then I tried to turn it on and I got this message \"Lens error. Restart camera.\" Every time I start the camera I get this message and can't go any further. There may be water under the lens (it looked like a little seeped through but it was hard to tell).In other words, the camera is broken. It worked at the beach for awhile, but I've only owned it for one month. Should last a lot longer than that for the price and because it is Canon. It is unfortunate because I really loved the quality and features up to that point.The next step is to contact Canon about repair options....", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good package for the price", "Author": "TomK1 \"tomk1\"", "ReviewID": "R3IJ2A4SL5UBXI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is basically one of Canon's typical point and shoots wrapped up in a waterproof shell.  It's an attractive camera, and while it's not tiny, it's hardly the huge camera some have implied.  Basically the nose of the camera is bulbous which makes it appear larger than it is.  The benefit is that the design eliminates the need for the lens to telescope into the body when not in use.  I don't think anyone will have an issue with size or shape.  And if you're familiar with Canon's \"operating system\" on their point and shoot cameras, you'll be at home.Picture quality is excellent as you'd expect, and the movie quality really is excellent, although it is limited by the 640x480 resolution, but this works pretty well in the water; as a stand-alone video camera, I would consider it lacking.I used it for a week in the water constantly in the Florida Keys.  I had no issue with water proofing, although the battery door should be examined every time because it is possible for the door to be closed, but not sealed.  I always checked it before I jumped in.I recommend that Zeikos ZE-FS10-OR Floating Strap that Amazon sells, It ties to the camera, and it will make the camera float.  If you lose it, it bobs right to the surface.  If you use this strap, you won't lose the camera in the water.Overall, for the price, it's a great camera, however, there are several significant flaws that you should be aware of:1) The view screen is coated so it is visible in water, however, it scratches *very easily*.  My first camera had a scratch out of the box (returned) and the 2nd got a scratch simply by placing it face down on a kitchen table.  Wow.  By contrast, I've had a panasonic camera in my pocket and tossed around for the better part of a year with no scratches.2) The mounting system is very well designed.  Unfortunately, Canon as far as I can tell, will not sell you the mounting clips.  Instead, you need to buy Canon AKT-DC1 Accessory kit, which has 3 or 4 mounting straps and new colored fronts.  If you're using this for snorkeling or scuba, you need this kit.  It's a great kit, but it's over $100.  Figure this into the purchase price of the camera.3) There are two ergonomic faults with the camera.  First, the 2.5\" display is too small to effectively use it when you're in a diving mask.  Maybe your eyes are better than mine, but it's hard to see the display to capture small details.  More significantly, there is no dedicated movie button.  You actually have to change modes by pressing a mode switch, and then using the cursor button to select movie versus program or auto mode.  This is a really big hassle and is the biggest flaw with the camera.4) Battery life could be better.  If you're going out, buy a 2nd battery at least.Overall though, I really liked the camera.

What more could I want!Cons:  I doesn't have a very wide angle, but I knew that going into the purchase.  And it did a this weird thing that if I was in video mode and zoomed in during videoing, it wouldn't focus on the subjects.  I'm not positive, but I don't think that's normal.  I have a regular Canon Powershot 800is (had it now for a few years) and I've never noticed it not keep the focus while zooming in and out during video mode.  It was minor irritation, but I thought I should mention it.I am a professional wedding photographer and am a big fan of Canon products.  It is hard for me not to take my big, fat professional cameras with me where ever I go, but when I'm playing around with my kiddos and need something small, lightweight, and not as expensive (in case it gets stolen), the Canon powershot camera line is awesome.  So when I decided to get a digital waterproof last minute before a family vacation, it was kind of a no-brainer.A friend of mine has a cute little, Panosonic digital waterproof camera (bought it almost a year ago) and he loves it.  I've seen his images from that camera and they are very good...so I was tempted to go with his recommendation, but being as I already have quite the Canon collection, I know they make good, solid, easy to use products, I decided on this one.  Glad I did.  I've only owned it for one month but it's already been on two vacations (I lent it to a friend going to Hawaii, plus our family vacation in Alabama) and is currently on a third one (lent it to my sister-in-law on her Mexico honeymoon).

Shoots great pictures..  underwater pictures and video are great!  You have to photoshop them a bit to get the blue hue out of the shot - something Canon should have built into the camera as an \"Underwater\" setting or somthing like that..  But, the 12megapixel resolution is great..  particularly the widescreen format.The camera is a but funky...  bulbous design doesn't lend itself to just putting in your pocket like the Nikon Coolpix, Panasonic Lumix or even the Sony T-series cameras.. however, it is light and totes along just fine in a small handbag or tote bag.Shutter lag is pretty standard.. around 1+ seconds.. so you can't really take any candid shots as typically your subject is a blur exiting the shot right or left!  As I own a Nikon D300s prosumer cam, this isnt a problem for us but something to keep in mind if you want to use this as your 'all-around' camera.What the Canon D10 really excels in is being taken on holiday to shoot in the mountains, near the water or any other extreme condition shooting. It is really tough and stands up to being thrown around.  We used it in the ocean with no problem... salt water doesn't bother it at all.The settings are a bit confusing..  coming from a Sony where most of the features and settings are quite obvious and intuitive, this camera presented a challenge to navigate the settings.  For example, we changed the setting to the Widescreen shooting format, but then none of us could figure out how to get it back to normal.  We eventually had to do a 'reset' to get it back.All around, we love the quality of the pictures and of course the underwater feature.

Do this:(1) Phone Canon and order 2 additional strap mounts (the camera will have already come with 1, for the included wrist strap).(2) Order Nikon's floating neck strap: http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Marine-Grade-Floating-Neckstrap/dp/B000075BCZ(3) Go to anyplace that sells fishing gear (I went to Sports Chalet), and buy split rings (what's that?: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419Qo145ivL._SL160_.jpg). Size 9 probably works best; get the closest to that that you can. You could, of course, just pull a couple of these off your key rings, but I'm thinking/hoping that the ones made for fishing won't rust as easily, and I know that they're stronger. But don't get much stronger than 40 lbs test -- get much stronger and you won't be able to work with it.(4) Use the split rings to permanently attach the Canon strap mounts to the ends of the Nikon neck strap; that's 2 split rings, 2 strap mounts, and 2 ends of the 1 neck strap.Tools I needed were: my fingernail (to start to pry apart the split ring), a flathead screwdriver (to finish prying it apart and then hold it like that for a moment while I slid on the strap mount), and a counter-mounted vice (I stood there in the bicycle repair dept at Sports Chalet and used theirs!...they didn't mind a bit; the vice gave me the steady extra hand I needed to hold the split ring in place while I pried it apart and slid on the strap mount). To get the split ring (which will be securely on the strap mount now!) on the end of the neck strap, you can just disassemble and then reassemble the strap's buckling; you'll see what I mean when you go to do it.Now you have a strap that will allow you to keep your camera handier than it would be in any other place while you're paddling, and allow you to film your shenanigans (the Canon D10, at least, has that function) while your hands are left free for paddling. Unlike the non-floating Canon neck strap, it will keep your camera from sinking like a rock into the inky depths after that breaking surge demolishes you out of nowhere. It will look cool. You will have made it yourself, sort of. Enjoy.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Underwater in the Abacos", "Author": "John O.

I love the color selection function, can't remember exactly what the function is called, but it is where you can select a color and the camera will only highlight in that color, making everything else in black and white - really neat function.  The video records great. And the battery life held up way longer than I thought it would have.  It takes great pictures in dark rooms/settings, bright light settings, inside, outside, where ever.

The picture quality is great.I love how durable it is. Even though I travel with it in a case, I no longer am worried about piling it in my backpack with a ton of other stuff when I'm going out to the beach or something.  You can drop this in the sand without it damaging any mechanically moving parts.This camera is really great about battery use.  When you set it on automatic mode, it takes really great photos, and usually there is no need for the flash to fire! In an environment where any other camera might fire the flash, Canon D10 seems to be smarter than the rest as it can take the same picture with no flash and produce a crisp image with true color - even in low light.Underwater, this camera is fantastic! At first, I was a little bit nervous to bring it underwater after reading on this website the reviews about the camera not working after the first underwater use. However, my experience with using this as an underwater camera has been perfect.  Underwater mode seems to empathize the colors of certain areas so details on fish, coral and other underwater life are beautifully captured. The compartments that you can open seem sturdy enough, but just in case I always check before entering the water that they are closed completely and that there is no sand in the cracks.This camera uses an anti red eye flash but in some photos, there you can still see a small amount of red in the eye.  Forget about using the red eye remover feature that this camera has, because it will just put a big dark circle that is larger than the eye in the image.Compared to the other user images taken with underwater point and shoot cameras, this one is superior. Also, I had a disposable underwater camera and those pictures came out awful!

The dry-land pictures were as good as any other point-and-shoot camera that we have owned (Nikon, Olympus, and Canon).  Others have complained that the camera is bulky but it fits in a jacket pocket easily.  I bought a floating strap for it but really didn't need it; the supplied strap cinches down to tightly fit around your wrist.  We used it snorkeling in this fashion and had no problems.

I was able to take nice pictures in varying lighting conditions. Simply, I used the underwater program and used the zoom. It is best to be in front or the side of the fish or coral. One should avoid shooting down. The view finder is very clean and true. The camera is very easy to hold and use. It is easy to hold and still use your arms for swimming. I was very pleased with the picture quality outside of the water. The picture quality is better than by small point and shoot camera. I did not expect the quality to be as good as by Canon T1i SLR, but I would not take this camera to the beach or near water.  I was very impressed with the video. Overall, this camera is a great product and good value.  I did buy a non canon battery for far less than the canon product and it worked fine.

I am very pleased with the results that I got. Overall, the camera performed well. However, I am glad that I took another camera with me as well. Compared to my Nikon cameras this one does not have optics that are as good. While most of the pictures that I took are good, they are not up to the quality of the images I get from either my Nikon digital SLR or even my Coolpix. Unfortunately, Nikon doesn't do underwater cameras and I'm not willing to trust my expensive camera to a plastic housing that might leak.If you are looking for a good point and shoot that is waterproof I highly recommend this camera. Being able to shoot video underwater is a wonderful bonus. A few suggestions:1. Purchase an extra battery.2. The accessory kit for this camera is worth every penny.3. I was surprised that this camera did not come with a flash card, every other one I've ever purchased did. When shopping for flash cards get one that is rated C6 (class/speed rating), everything else will be WAY to SLOW for shooting unless you are only taking pictures of stationary objects.One other issue is with the microphone on the front of the camera: when shooting video in breezy conditions I found that, upon playback, you get really bad wind sounds -- you'd think I'd been in a hurricane. However, if you keep your finger in front of the tiny microphone to block the breeze it helps.Many people have commented about the size and shape of the camera. Not sure what their issue is, I had no problems with it. If you want something the size of a credit card, look elsewhere. If you want a good underwater camera and reasonable point and shoot then this is the camera for you.

This is my 4th canon & based on my experience (and the experience of my 2 pro photographer friends) they make the best cameras.also, i can't say enough about what a great company canon is. when i broke the seal on my D10 & got some water in it, i sent it back to be fixed. i assumed that i'd have to pay for the fix (after all i am hard on this thing). canon didn't charge me a cent and they mailed me a brand new one. incredible.last year when i broke the lens on my G10 skiing, i sent it in for a repair. canon fixed it fast, sent it back fast, and charged me a small, reasonable fee. canon makes legendary products and their customer service is extraordinary.the only draw back with the D10 is the shutter speed. for action sports you long for a rapid response so you can get a lot of shots. that said, you can't expect the performance of a high-end DSLR in this form factor/price point.for action junkies who want a point & shoot - this is the choice.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera.. great price..

The camera worked well and took excellent pictures.  Sadly, it is no longer with us, for the following reason:Access to the battery and memory card is through a compartment at the right base of the camera.  This is opened by pushing a latch on the compartment door from right to left.  While using the camera, your right hand thumb rests on this latch.  Under normal conditions, this is not a problem.  However, if you are in the water being pushed around by waves or surge, and are holding the camera trying to take pictures, your thumb can move and easily unlatch the compartment, letting water in.  This has happened to me twice.  Once with the Canon and once with an older Olympus Stylus Tough (which had the same design for its battery compartment: this design may have been changed on later cameras).With the Olympus, I was trying to get pictures in heavy surf and was being thrown around by the waves.  With the Canon, I was snorkeling through rocks in strong surge.  In both cases, my thumb was on the latch and the compartment door only partially released, but it was enough to let in a few drops of water which completely wrecked both cameras.It would seem that better placement of the latch/compartment would take care of this problem, and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worked as advertised in caves, ocean, jungle !!!", "Author": "oriole", "ReviewID": "R141JWZCVLJFBN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got back from Cozumel Mexico.

Trust me, I REALLY wanted to love this camera!Overall, the functions are great and it is ready to shoot almost instantly after turning on. The outdoor photos are exceptional and comparable to my Sony PowerShot DSC-TX1.  The indoor photos lack quality and are borderline unacceptable.  Video is okay; my only complaint is the glare from the sun on water causes strange lines in the video. Using it while snowboarding in sub-32 weather has never been a problem, even with some pretty good falls, so I can't argue with the \"cold-resistant\" and \"shockproof\" claims.Unfortunately, the D10 is not waterPROOF as advertised (which is why I bought it in the first place); it is water-resistant. I can take it in the pool and shoot underwater without any problems but ocean water has caused many problems. I am currently on my 4th (yes, 4th!) D10 because taking pictures in the ocean for surfing/snorkeling has caused the camera to malfunction. Somehow, water leaks in and ruins it, even after just a couple minutes of taking pictures in the surf. None of the cameras have been more than 15ft underwater so I was not pushing its \"33ft\" limit. I find it hard to believe that I was issued 3 defective cameras by chance. It can handle splashes and some water immersion easily but mine failed after 5-30min in the ocean. Luckily, all of the cameras were replaced under warranty. The warranty on the last one I received has expired so I'm wary of taking it into the ocean...I would have given it 1 star because it claims to be waterproof and I have not found that to be the case, however, I added an extra star because Canon's customer service has been great and every problem that I had was dealt with efficiently.

We recharged every night but did not have any problem with battery life after using it all day to take both photos and video. The 3X zoom was sufficient for all of our photo requirements. There is also digital zoom but we did not use that often. This was in roughly 30 ft of water. The camera has simple, easy to understand and easy to master controls. Some of the other settings that you might be used to on \"Cannon land cameras\" such as changing the ISO are a little more challenging. Since those all  run through the menu on the back rather than a button on the camera, some prior consideration of shooting conditions rather than changing \"in the heat of battle\" is the way to go,  but still it was not a problem.  The display  on the back is large, bright and easy to use both in and out of the water. There is a short learning curve mastering the  framing photos while swimming.

They will distort your pictures, I have literally hundreds of pictures that are awesome except someones head is totally blown up by this. It occurs to me now that a touch of RainX on the lense might solve this but I have yet to test it.2nd biggest complaint is unique to this camera, and perhaps just to mine. Sometimes, and this would only be at the start of water adventures, the camera will just fail to come on. This won't have anything to do with battery power but I think is because it thinks there is like 1 water molecule in the battery compartment or something. Usually waiting a few hours will solve this and I think it is caused by maybe me not 100% closing the battery door after charging the battery.3rd complaint is that using the flash causes a visible shadow in your image from the top of the lense house blocking part of the light from the flash.At the time, this was one of the few available in its price range. Now there are many sleeker options, but at the time it stood out. It is fairly heavy and bulky, you would not comfortably keep this in your pocket. Perhaps I would not buy this in today's market, but I am not sure other cameras would have withstood the abuse this has taken.Complaints aside, this thing is a beast, I've been spelunking, snorkeling, diving, river floating, boating, camping, hiking, biking, etc with this. It has hit rocks, concrete, trees, boats, etc and while it has its share of scratches, still operates like it did day one.

(Although after taking it in salt water I made sure to rinse the camera off with non-salty water!) Even the sound underwater is good; as in one video I took in SA, the shark swam right into the diving cage and the sound of the shark hitting the cage in the video is awesome!I usually shoot on a Nikon DSLR, but I wanted a point and shoot to take with me in more \"adventurous\" locations. I would definitely recommend this camera, although now it has been around for a while so I am not sure if there are any improved models. The one thing that puzzles me about it (that I wish I could change) is the silly shape of this camera. I wish I could fit it in my back pocket - but alas the camera is bubbly and a bit bulky for a pocket.

The second replacement of (3rd camera) we used for the first time in my parents pool in NJ and it filled with water the first time.

While we were waiting for the replacement of that one, we purchased the Olympus digital water camera - and I HATE IT.  The quality of the pictures is pathetic, which just makes me even more sad that our Canon has failed us again.

Water leaked inside on the 2ND time I ever used the thing.(Before this happened,  beach pictures taken on dry land were very vivid and of nice quality).I swam back to shore, removed the battery and card,  kept the door open to dry it out , hoping that would fix the problem. I did not notice much wetness, and I was lucky all my photos on that SD memory card were still intact. Then, I went back in the water to see what I could see, which was amazing. I saw really big fish in schools, but the \"piece de resistance\" was a VERY large beautiful sea turtle... the only one I have ever seen. He let me swim alongside him for a long time. I loved it, but of course was miffed about the bummer camera and being unable to photo this gentle giant turtle.Later, I installed my extra battery and a different card, heard a sound as if the camera was starting up, but no.

And I love that I can get great pictures with this camera and can save my more expensive camera for places that do not involve water.I have never had another waterproof camera, so I can't compare it to others, but it does what I want it to do. If you are planning on using the camera in places that involve water that is either dirty or deep, be sure you get a flotation strap for it.  That way if (when) you drop it in - or your canoe flips - it floats and you don't lose it to the bottom of the lake/creek/etc...", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Leaked after 18 months", "Author": "Mario Romualdo M.

Consequently, my girlfriend thought that this would be a great camera for me and shelled out the cash for it, especially since I'd been using her hand-me-down, ancient Canon PowerShot 540 with pretty good success.  Anyway, bottom line, she should've kept the dough she blew on the D10, and I should've held onto the 540.  Why?  Image quality.  I continually have to fight with this camera to get a good, in-focus image.  Part of the problem is that the automatic functions do very poorly in low-light or really contrasting conditions - they either continually over- or underexpose the subject.  To address that, I now only use the manual modes, and I still have to constantly play with the light-metering function, the ISO speeds, the focus, etc to get an image that is focused correctly, with the right exposure, and that isn't blurry.  Particularly frustrating is the focus, which is extremely finicky and way too frequently does not focus on the subject even in daylight conditions.  In general, about 1 out of every 7 shots actually turns out well, which, from my persepctive, is unacceptable.  On the flip side, the camera is very durable - utterly frustrated with it one time, I lost my cool and slammed the thing to the ground.  Fortunately, or, perhaps, UNfortunately, the thing survived.  Suffice it to say, I'll be replacing this camera in the very new future.  Want mine?

No problem. Snowy? Not concerned. Dropped the camera in the mud? It's okay, i'll just rinse it off. Need two hands? Fits in my pocket! I have this little guy and a spare battery and i'm ready for anything.I got this in 2009 for a vacation when it was newish on the market after a great deal of research.

It's been in the ocean snorkeling, in the mountains in snow, zip-lining through jungles, wading through creeks and streams, and on many hiking trips. It's been dropped, bonked, plunged, crushed, and rained on so many times. It takes great pictures and it keeps going!PROS:- Goes where other cameras can't. This alone makes it worth the price.- Takes pretty darned good pictures for a point and shoot (this is from a professional who knows how to really scrutinize an image, too)- Turns on and off instantly. This is important because i usually turn it off in between shots to conserve battery power. It's instant-on as soon as i need to take another shot.- I can leave my SLR bag at home. This is really important if you travel carry-on only.- Battery lasts forever.- Excellent color and white balance.- Underwater!- Washable. Like, *in the sink*. How cool is that?CONS:- Shutter lag gets annoying. (Not a good action camera).- Bulky. (Newer model is better.)- Limited zoom range. (Because it's a fixed housing, it can't zoom too far in or out, but still a really good general purpose range. Newer model fixes this too.)- Image quality won't match an SLR CMOS sensor. Most people won't care, but professionals might. If I needed this professionally, I would go with an SLR. I only use it for trips though.- No auto-stitch panorama mode.- No full-manual settings (but it's not an SLR either, what were you expecting?)- Microphone picks up a lot of hand noise on videos.But overall: worth every penny!", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware!!", "Author": "Melody Henderson \"Cricuttown dot com\"", "ReviewID": "RTEOQ0D8ALYF2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last November to use on our family vacation to Hawaii.

It did quite well on fishing trips where it withstood rainy conditions, wet hands and a few splashes here and there. That was until I took it to the beach recently.

I even made a short movie while snorkeling, and despite what some of the negative reviews might say, this camera does record sound (you can hear me breathing underwater through the mask).In other settings, the camera did well, too. Like most digital cameras, you lose some focus when you zoom to close to things or in very low light. Overall, though, in a variety of settings this camera took some great photos, much better than one would expect for a camera at this price. One thing I would recommend is take the camera off of the auto mode and experiment with the different mode options for photos and video. If you're trying to take a photo of something in low light from 40 feet away, the auto mode is going to try to use the flash and you're going to end up with a dark, out-of-focus photo.

It was easy to get used to, although not quite as compact as my previous camera. The lens does not contract. Not only did the camera perform well for underwater shots, it turned out to be very useful in other ways. At one point I had a boat ride, with spray and the occasional wave coming over the side. I was able to keep right on taking pictures! Often we disembarked from the cruise ship in Zodiacs, with the possibility of a dunking, but I had no fears for my camera. Heavy tropical downpours soaked through my backpack, melted my cough drops, but the camera was just fine. I also found it handy to hold just below the surface while wading along the beach. So even if you aren't a snorkeler, this is a great camera for the outdoors. I got some nice shots of sea urchins in that way. I already had another Canon camera, not waterproof, with very similar controls, so that may be part of the reason this camera was so easy for me to use immediately. I noticed several  improvements in the interface over my previous camera, including changing the position of the Erase option so one is less likely to accidentally loose a picture. There are lots of features, and you will want to consult the user manual, if only to avoid activating something accidentally. The battery/SD card chamber seals very well, and in fact the camera won't turn on if you haven't got it shut properly, a good safety feature. I sometimes had to squeeze the door shut to get a proper seal, although I couldn't have told by looking that it wasn't sealed, so I like that feature. Also, I had one panic when I could not get it open, after moving from high altitude back to sea level. It had really sealed tight! But I was able to pry the door open, once I realized the problem. I got very good photos and short videos, including one of a chameleon snapping up an insect.

I used it in every condition; indoors, outdoors, night, day, beach, jungle, underwater and every time it performed perfectly. I was probable most impressed with the underwater capabilities. I have never been a fan of vacation videos but being able to switch over to take a video of a turtle swimming by and then right back to stills without leaving the water was VERRY cool! I probably used it underwater 5 or 6 times during my stay and I never had a problems with leaks, and truth be told I was not that diligent about cleaning all the seals after each use.  Ok, a couple of minor gripes. As other reviews have mentioned the battery life is very short. I always carry spares which was a good thing, I usually went through 2 in a day. Not that big a deal but if you are looking to purchase this camera I would Definitely recommend a spare. My second minor gripe is the shape.

We were Canon fans anyway, so it was an easy choice.  If you have used other Canon cameras, this one is a breeze to use as it has all the standard features and usage of a regular Canon point and shoot.  The quality of shots is similar as well, with the regular drawbacks of not being great at action shots or macro.  The facial recognition worked well, as did the image stabilization.  It was actually pretty good in low light as well, with not much noise in the photos.  Overall we were quite happy with it.The one problem we had is kind of a big one though... The camera leaked twice.  Since we were snorkelling in the ocean, we made sure to take all the maintenance steps recommended.  After about 10-12 snorkelling sessions and lots of use on the beach, the camera appeared to quit working.  After playing with it a bit, it seemed to be just the LCD had failed.  So we took it back to our hotel, cleaned it, then left it to dry.  The next day upon opening the AV door, water drained out.  So it is possible it had not been closed tightly, though it appeared to have been.  We left it for 2 days, tried it again, and it worked normally.  About 6-7 snorkelling sessions later, the same thing happened.  This time I am certain all doors were closed tightly as we were triple checking before using.  Also, it was not just the LCD.  Nothing was working.  Fortunately this was the last day of our vacation and no photos were lost.  Upon returning home and waiting a week, it still didn't start up.  So we shipped it back to Canon for warranty support and they replaced it with a new one...So we're still happy Canon customers.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "6 month later dead LCD scren", "Author": "John J.

A few observations:- It was great to know that an unexpected rain shower or a splash while riding a Zodiac would not be a problem.- Photos in general were excellent.- White balance, even with the underwater setting, is not very good more than a few inches below the surface.  Be prepared to adjust after the fact.- The camera can be very slow to respond to the shutter button under water.  When you are holding your breath, trying to hold position, and shooting active fish, this can be VERY annoying.- The rounded shape makes it hard to feel secure holding the camera.  This leads to a tendency to wrap your whole hand around it, and then it's likely that a sunscreen-covered finger will land on the lens window.- The waterproof access doors are very clever.  They are easy to use and keep out the water.  No messing around with seals and silicone as with a separate housing.- I would have tried one of the alternate straps, but they are very expensive.- The 10 meter depth rating made me comfortable that I would not accidentally go too deep for the camera while snorkeling.  Many competing cameras are rated to 5 meters or less, which is not enough for me.In conclusion, I highly recommend this camera for situations where it might accidentally get wet, or for playing around in a pool, in the surf, et cetera.

wonderful camera for my upcoming cruise vacation..............as my Nikon D300.........will not work for snorkeling........and going to the beach...........while this very atractive pint sized performer.........will fill the bill........I find you have to make sure that the battery hatch cover is closed tightly and properly........it kind of makes a woosh noise........when closed properly......I have taken some test fotos..........and I must say that once you set the menu up...........such as setting you pictures on the vivid mode for a little extra color pop........its.very ,very nice..and lets not forget that this camera is a 12.1 megapixel........with the Canon Advanced Digic processor.........Anyway I will report back when I return from my cruise vacation..and post some of the pictures and videos I will take....so far I think this is a teriffic performer.and I highly reccomend it............Well I have returned from my cruise vacation........the Canon D 10 performed flawlessly......I shotbeautiful fotos as well as excellent Underwater video in the Caribbean Sea........at Sting Ray City.........One thing I Would Reccomend is once your done shooting in salt water.Soak the d 10 in a sink of Fresh Water.for about 30 min. to clean the camera and remove any salt residue..............to prevent the salt water  from harming the seals on the camera",

In that time period, I've not had major issues with the camera.  The pictures were fine for my purposes (mostly shots of my kids playing in the pool), however the camera response/focus time is rather slow but I figured this was a trade off for the waterproofing and its ruggedness.The death knell for this camera went as such:  I went to a pool party.  At first the camera worked fine as usual.  Then I began to notice some sort of strange artifact with the LCD viewfinder.  I turned the camera off and noticed there was condensation.  This was not a good sign.  I had never seen it before.  And then I looked at the front of the camera and there was water under the outside lens/cover.  I took the camera out and open the ports.  No water in either the battery compartment or the USB compartment.  Luckily the SD card was intact and I could eventually pull the files onto my computer's hard drive when I got home.Obviously a seal failed somewhere. I did not dive or have any sort of impact with the water, and did not take it deeper than 10 feet.  I was just wading around taking pictures during a birthday party for kids.  Since the camera is over 2 years old, I'm not sure what Canon will do with it, if anything.  It'll probably be a write off but I'll give them a call after the weekend.

The freedom to take shots ANYWHERE is great.  Our only negative is while you zoom-in taking video the camera does not focus.  Therefore close-up shots are blurry.  However, there are many settings available which may fix this problem.  Otherwise, we're very pleased with this camera.Update 11/2012: While we have created many memories with this camera there is one very annoying problem that's becoming worse.  For some reason the camera has trouble connecting to fully charged batteries.  When we attempt to turn on the camera it says \"Change the battery pack.\" We use the primary and a spare and get the same reaction.  This seems to be a VERY common problem.  There are two reasons for this: the metal contacts can get dirty and the 3 metal \"spring-like\" contacts in the camera tend to get pushed back each time the battery is inserted.Solution: Using a q-tip we cleaned the metal battery contacts in the camera and on the batteries with a little rubbing alcohol.  Then we used a long needle to gently pull the metal contacts inside the camera out.  Using the pointy edge of the needle we gently inserted it under the metal contacts and gently pushed them up a little.Update 9/2013:  Well, the \"Change the battery pack\" has become too much of an issue.  In fact a friend is now going through the same situation.  Our solution doesn't really work anymore.  Therefore we decided to retire this camera.  Rather than go with the next model the D20 and possibly encounter similar problems we bought the less expensive Fujifilm XP60 which has worked great so far.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "otello", "Author": "otello", "ReviewID": "R34AT6IID78UJV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing quality!

Until you get into a difficult lighting situation where the camera can't decide whether or not to use the flash. Then at least half of the time when it should use the flash it does not. In this case the pictures come out very noisy. There needs to be a way to set the flash to fire when you want it to. There is no setting for that, there is only auto or off. So if you find that you take a lot of pictures indoors or around dusk, then you might want to consider another camera. Also there is quite a long lag for focusing. This is not a camera to use for a spur of the moment shot. I am happy with the way it performs under water and in wet conditions though. I bought this mainly for that and it does a good job there.

The fact that it happened during a vacation in French Polynesia, that I'd saved for for 2 years and built around snorkeling photography, was enough to sour me on this camera and I could not recommend it.  It is one of 3 underwater cameras that I've purchased (the other two are Pentax and one of those also flooded) and FEELS better built than the other 2.I believe the weakness is in the control buttons -- in my experience you CANNOT apply any real pressure to the buttons and must use the absolute minimum pressure necessary to trigger the shutter, change menu functions, etc.  My camera failed as I excitedly mashed the shutter button when a Moray eel popped out of a hole in front of me, in less than 5 feet of water just off Tatakoto Atoll in FP.  When I say \"mashed\", I mean the amount of pressure you'd apply to the button on a DSLR like a Nikon D70 -- certainly in no way an abusive or excessive amount of pressure.  Just a \"Hey!  Oh, I gotta get this WOW!\" amount of pressure from that little adrenaline burst that tells you you're taking a winning photograph.  In my situation, there was a little flicker of the view screen on the back of the camera, and then darkness.  When I surfaced, there was a sickening spread of cloudy water growing across the INSIDE of the rear-body display.  Later, looking at the front of the camera, I noticed a dirty spread of water/slime across the INSIDE of the lens.I really, really hate returning this camera but back it must go before the 30 day Amazon return policy expires.  It's just too expensive to fail so easily.  I'm going to take the recommendation of [...] (who gave this camera a good review in the single-body category) and buy a normal digital camera and a separate waterproof case, on the theory that the small amount of water that destroyed the Canon D10 would possibly be noticeable as a leak in the separate case and give me at least a CHANCE of saving my camera by quickly surfacing.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "I Love This Camera !", "Author": "Bykergus \"bykergus\"", "ReviewID": "R3CFUIRNBKC5AH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

Because I live in Hawaii and spend 3-6 hours a week using the camera it probably gets more underwater use than the average consumer underwater camera.The Canon D10 I just bought at Amazon is the 3rd Canon D10 I've purchased. I would have given this camera 5 stars in terms of how it performs. The reason I didn't is that I've had problems with the LCD screen getting moisture in it after a short while. However, Canon customer support has been amazingly responsive to my problems. When they couldn't fix my problem they sent me a new camera. They've done this for me 3 times. The directions say to soak the camera for a couple of hours after using it in salt water. I used to do this. I stopped doing this when I kept ending up with the condensation problems. I now rinse the camera under cold water and carefully dry it. It's been much better since making this change.It is important to close both of the compartments on the camera very carefully. I now always test those before going in the water. Sometimes they are closed and don't show red, but are not fully closed. This has helped with the issue of condensation. I wish they had this explained more emphatically in the directions.The D10 has an underwater setting that brings in some of the reds that are often lost in underwater shots. This makes a huge difference in producing shots have the full color spectrum, rather than the normal blue/green hue you often find with consumer underwater cameras.The settings are easy to use and fairly intuitive. The LCD screen is also bright and easy to see while underwater. One thing I would like to see on a future version of the camera would be the option to zoom while shooting video.Despite the down side to this camera that I've mentioned. I absolutely love using this camera. I wouldn't have purchased 3 of them despite the problems if I didn't.If you would like to see underwater shots taken with the D10 in Hawaii, visit \"Hawaiian Art Photography dot com\"To be fair I must say that I do some darkroom type adjustments to the photos to bring out the depth of color. But what is amazing is that the color is there to be brought out. This is not the case with all consumer underwater cameras. I've tried others and ended up sending them back for this reason.On a final note, if you do have any problems with the camera, I can't say enough nice things about Canon Customer Support.

Everyone felt like they were in the raft with us. Shooting video in the ocean while doing boogie boarding was great too.I paid a lot more than the current price and think it was worth it.ConsI wish it fit in my pocket like the Nikon AW100.The neck strap configuration, which looks like a great convenience, is an extra and is priced excessively. Highway robbery by Canon if you ask me.Towards the end--my wife lost the camera this summer--the zoom wasn't working while recording video. That wasn't good.I've basically sworn off of Canon point and shoots because of recurring dead pixel problems on the LCD--\"scratch\" lines give way to a dime-size gray circle, which are annoying although picture quality is not affected.

You can sort of tell by the pictures of the camera, but it's bulky (even more so when you see and hold it) and won't easily fit in a normal shirt pocket.  I like to carry a camera when hunting, but this thing is so bulky that you have carry it in a fanny pack or some sort of additional carrier.  The biggest disappointment though is the image quality.  As others have mentioned, the images are grainy even for a camera with half the pixel density.  Add to that the exposures (typically a Canon strength in their SLRs) which are almost ALWAYS overexposed, and you get the picture so-to-speak.  I hunted for the disk that included Canon's DPP software thinking I could adjust exposures after the fact using raw digital image files.  No such luck.  I don't believe this camera will record in raw mode, and DPP software is not included.  If you MUST have a waterproof camera (and even that is suspect if the reviews are read carefully and thoroughly), then this camera might be OK.

As far as this camera being waterproof up to 33 feet, it wasn't waterproof at 3 feet.PICTURES: The pics come out fine, not the best I've seen, a little soft around the edges but still pretty good. Nice functions, and the auto scene select is a nice touch and works good. The underwater pics came out better then the non-under water pics, although using the flash somethimes makes it too bright and I couldn't make out the fish in the pics. I took some photos of some coral and it came out nice and colorful (without the flash). When using this camera indoors, the flash is way too bright and tends to over-expose.VIDEO: When taking Videos underwater there is a constant clicking noise. Other then that, the videos came out nice and clear and are fun to watch. It does get pretty fuzzy and grainy when using the zoom though.OVERALL: The camera still takes photos and video, but I can't see what I'm shooting and that's a real pain. I do not recommend this camera; I feel ripped off after paying $300.00 for it. I really expected it to work as advertised, especialy being a Canon camera. If you are buying this, and are taking it on vacation, bring a backup.

I release most of my fish so the photo I take is often the only thing that proves I was on the water and not at the bar. After finally getting my hands on the D10, I opted to pick up a very reasonably priced Panasonic ZS1, (not waterproof), at Costco for about $100 less.The ZS1 is a much better camera for the money. While I would have preferred a waterproof camera, for the time being, I will just have to resort to keeping the Panasonic in a plastic bag while out fishing.I am a big Canon fan and am certain that one of these days they will release a waterproof camera that befits the Canon name.
