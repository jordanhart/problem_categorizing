Those reviewers probably just expected the product to work as advertised, which it doesn't. Just for the record, I build computers, service networks, and work with various types of electrical equipment from blood analyzers to HDTV hardware, and the outdoor model of this product has one major failing .... reliability! Couple that with confusing warranty requirements and poor support I consider buying this outdoor camera a poor investment because it will eventually fail. Don't get me wrong .... when it works it has great features, but eventually the camera will likely die. I installed 4 of these at home and 2 at church in the last 3 years. 2 have since been replaced under warranty and another was replaced by an additional purchase. Currently only 2 of these cameras work at all. Although the features are terrific, they are useless when the camera dies. I suspect the outdoor cameras would function correctly if installed inside when the temperature is more consistent ... but outdoors they fail. There are a couple of other annoying distractions as well. If you install on the wrong side of your Service Panel the camera will fail .... as well as failing if installed too far from the camera's USB Receiver. If you install too close to a photo cell from a night light the camera will also fail. The thumbscrew mounting post assembly is poorly designed and is marginal at best in locking the camera to it's desired position. A bird flying into or landing on the camera will change it's aiming point. And birds will ... and do.

Still very satisfied", "Author": "Tool Chick", "ReviewID": "R90F0PI3KWHQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a Logitech WiLife indoor and outdoor camera for over a year now. They have worked without a problem. No camera rebooting, no 'lost' cameras, etc.To cover another angle of the house I added this outdoor camera to the system in May 2010. It could not have been easier to install. You plug it in and the software finds it, that's it. The most time was spend adjusting the view angle of the camera once it was installed, having to climb up and down a ladder and going back inside the house to see the adjustments. (If I had a internet connected smartphone or labtop, even that would have been quick) The manual says that it should not be plugged into a power strip, don't know if that also implies that an extension cord should not be used. Maybe I should not recommend this, but, I have used a 25 foot heavy duty outdoor extension cord on both of these outdoor cameras, (one extension cord is even plugged into another extension cord inside the garage!). My  20 year old \"tract home\" does not have enough outlets and I did not want to go through the expense and time to have new ones installed when this did work flawlessly. The quality of the image seems perfect to me, there might be a reason why this should not work well, but I have not had a problem.On the very sunny side of the house (all day sun) I build a three sided simple box for the camera to fit underneath. It seemed to me that having this nice outdoor camera, which is a computer, baking in the sun, day in and day out, would not be good. The other camera is underneath the eave of the house and more protected from the hot sun.A tip on the software: When in playback mode, after selecting the day(s) I want to view and pressing 'play', I use my keyboards right and left arrow keys to quickly move through the recording segments. Using the keyboard, as apposed to the buttons displayed on the monitor, it does not reset to 'pause' between each section. Selecting a playback speed higher than normal, I often use the setting of \" 6.5\", lets you quickly go through days of videos, even if you have lots of recorded sections, like I have in front of the house.Highly recommend this product!", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Defective Cameras", "Author": "Paul K.

So I went online and download the newer version of the software and that did work. The software is really easy to use and it detected all cameras fast. I went ahead and tried unplugging cameras and moving them to different parts of the home. Then I would go and check if they would work. After checking my entire house all cameras worked perfect in all outlets of my home (700sqft).Just to see how it would work on a different larger home (3200sqft) I did the same. However there are some spots that the camera would lag or it would not show up at all. The trick here was to find a good location for the receiver that could get all three working.After all the testing this is what I gathered:1. Cameras need to be in same circuit (obvious) - this might be bad for large homes or offices with many different circuit panels2. Cameras are good when there is light and very poor in the dark.3. You can not use a surge protector nor power strip (exception see below)4. Best picture 1. outdoor cam 2. indoor 3. hidden5. Software is decent but not good for remote view as it crashes and requires computer reboot. I use Blue Iris running at the same time to remote view.So over all its a good system picture quality is decent, you can see a face if they are within 15 feet from lens.The indoor cam is the only cam that had a Ethernet cable this is nice because you can place the power (transmitter) in your network closet. This is good because the noise of the fan is loud.If you wish to use a UPS or surge protector for all your cameras you will have to run power or Ethernet cables to one location. Then connect them to the same UPS or surge protector.So I will highly recommend this to a average Joe the is in a budget. However keep in mind that your home wiring might not work with this product. I recommend purchasing a Master unit and testing the locations you want to use first. Amazon has a pretty good return policy especially if you are a prime user. I recommend a warranty purchase since company will not fix or support after on year.ProEasy to setup and installGood picture qualityCompatible with Blue Iris and other software for IP camsIn most cases no wiring is neededConsDefault software remote view is is bad and requires a yearly feeIf your home electric wiring setup does not support the locations you like you will have to run cablesComputer always on and running is neededMany users have reported failure after only one year of use", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME protection for the price!", "Author": "Tonya Norris \"Vermiposting Diva\"", "ReviewID": "R3JIIHZM9ED1HT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best protection for the money.

The \"HomeLink\" system can be intermittent.I am considering a D-link system which offers many different camera options, hardwired and wireless, powered exterior cases, Windows Home Server support and no annual fees.  Also there are alot of IP network security cameras now available.  These operate independant of a PC. Panasonic offers models for home, small business and industrial at an assortment of price ranges and features.  Samsung is also in this market.  These cameras offer HD resolution, true pan and scan with auto tracking, low light sensitivity down to .07 Lux, bidirectional audio and a broader operational temperature range.  They store images locally within the cameras but allow you to download to your PC's hard drive or to another website.All these features come at a price though.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not the best but very easy", "Author": "John Noonan", "ReviewID": "R256LNKCH1OENJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's not the best construction and it's not the best quality video but it could not be any easier to install and use and the picture quality is fine.

I bought several cameras, both indoor and outdoor. The system worked really well for almost a year. Then one of my outdoor cameras went out. Its a long process (about 4-6 weeks), but using the online help desk, they replaced it free of charge. While I was waiting for the replacement to arrive, a second outdoor cam went out. In addition, the replacement had fuzzy quality right out of the box. After another back and forth process on the online help desk, they replaced both cameras free of charge. I just installed them and their video quality is good. So yes, the cams are finicky but the customer service is good if you are persistent.Some of the things I really like: no pulling wire, mobility of cameras, free online remote viewing (can be a little tricky to set up depending on your firewall and virusware configurations), customizable motion sensitivity, email or cell phone alerts (snap shot, video or text). I am able to keep an eye on my property and my dogs while I am at work or out of town.Would I buy this system again? Maybe.

I asked him why didn't  the website motioned that when I was purchasing  the items on-line? He refused to answer my question. Logitech actually charged my credit card for items they did not have in stock.  The customer service rep was very discourteous, unfriendly and did not even apologized for the inconvenience.  He  immediately offered  to refund my credit card for the charges and gave me an RMA number to return the rest of the order. I would have kept the merchandize if he would have shown some interest in keeping my business. I guess they don't  need the business.I bought the AT&T; Home Monitoring System and it is much better and cheaper.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0017U6BZU"}}
