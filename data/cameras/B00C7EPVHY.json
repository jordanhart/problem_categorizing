{"Reviews": [{"Title": "CAMERA, GALEXY, EK-GC110  TRULY TOP OF THE LINE FOR CAMERAS", "Author": "Adler", "ReviewID": "RN06BQ9QFZO0E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have reviewed a significant number of products , plus my current cameras that I have enjoyed.  This camera really presents unbelievable options for \"point-and - shoot\".  It also gives individuals the opportunity who like to manually adjust the functions of the camera.  It's telescopic lens is very powerful and makes distance shooting a real pleasure.  Picture quality is excellent.I have no negatives but all positives.  Here are some of the features that I really like:1.  Great Telescopic lens2.  The camera offers 3 modes.  \"Automatic\", which is a simple point and shoot with the camera adjusting accordingly.  \"Expert\",  The feature allows you to do all the manual adjustments that you prefer.  In using your adjustments, the camera even prompts you on the results expected to achieve with your adjustments.  The graphics for adjusting your lens , a truly sensational.  Any person can feel really comfortable using the  \"Expert\" mode.  This mode is really great for professional or advanced type of photographers.\"Smart \" Mode.  This is my favorite.  There are 38 different scenarios.  Some of these are ,  Sunset Pictures, Low Light Room, Snow Pictures, Portrait Pictures, which really enhance faces.  I am not a photographer but enjoy cameras.  I decided to take a sunset picture and set the camera in that mode.  Unbelievable results.  It was as simple as point and shoot.  The camera will self adjust to the scenario and come up with a fantastic result.  The \"Panoramic Scenario\"  is super.  If you take a picture of the horizon.  You pan the camera across , taking 3 individual shots.  Because the camera is GPS noted.  It makes sure that each separate shot lines up with the previous pan shot.  Again on my first try.  I took some great panoramic pictures.  On this type of shot, a tripod is easier to use.  As mentioned above.  38 different preprogramed settings for your picture desire.  I am now proud to show some of my pictures to my friends.3.  WiFi Feature.  This is truly a benefit.  As I will explain later you can use your camera as a Tab, Galexy, I-Pad.  To continue.  The Wifi Features allows you to send your picture to your computer.  Or send, the picture by email or messaging to your friends, directly from the camera.  I enjoy editing and do the like doing the work on my I Mac.  When I come come, I just turn on the camera and and through Wifi send  the picture to my Mac.  This transfer is accomplished by a program called \"Kies\" , and is part of the cameras software package.  The set up with your computer should be very easy.4.  Communications feature.  This is a great feature.  When you go shooting scenes , you will not need additional devices to communicate.  E-mails, Messaging, Chatting, maps and location, GPS driving instructions, Web surfing, can all be done by the camera.  That is what I call a real convenience.  About the only down side is:  this is not a phone.  But, it has all the features for a camera including Tab, Galaxy, iPad , type of activities.5.  I had considered, getting a camera with attachable lenses.  For my purposes, I am glad I got this.  The variables a great and I don't have to fiddle with lens attachments  .6.  The camera is a little bigger than your standard Point-and-Shoot camera but can fit into your pocket.  The screen display is very easy to read.  The software of the camera is really friendly and easy to work with.  I chose the White color and get a lot of compliments on the aesthetic (design ) of the camera.  It easily fits into your hand .7.  In addition, If you wish to edit your picture on the camera.  The camera has a great software to really enhance the picture.  Because of the great screen display, the editing is easy to do.This camera, I also believe is a good choice for a professional type of photographer.  I really believe that , Samsung has perfected a \"top of the Line\"  point and shoot type of camera.  I am very, very , pleased;  and feel that this is a-- \"Must Have\",-- for everyone.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "wow what a camera!", "Author": "TheWiredKnot", "ReviewID": "RZHAE8EZ6DVGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the camera only, not the company 'Sunset Electronics' (I will explain at the end of this review) This camera exceeded my expectations. For those who were also wondering, this is a rechargable camera that uses the exact same charger as the samsung galaxy S4 and the samsung galaxy note and others I'm sure, I just happen to have those 2 samsung products. One of the reasons I chose this camera was to be able to connect and share with my other samsung devices. And it works perfectly. If you have been on the fence about getting a wi-fi camera GET OFF THE FENCE and buy one. My all time favorite feature is when I take a picture it is automatically sent to my dropbox account and sent to all of the my other devices including my my desktop and laptop where I can do final editing and what not. I make jewelry so I have to take several shots of each piece and I love that when I sit down at my desk all of the pics I took are already waiting for me to edit and upload to my online store. It just doesn't get easier than this. What else is cool is that it has the android operating system so you can even use it just like you do your tablet or android phone...play games, send email, etc. What more can I say, I love it!!!...with all that being said, I bought this from Sunset Electronics here on amazon. The 1st camera had a piece of dust inside the focusing lenses that caused a spot on the pics. I returned it, no big deal. Got the 2nd camera and this time the seal is broken on the box. Inside the box was a camera charger adapter for some other country...so I returned that one too and reordered a 3rd camera from 'Another Deal Site' seller. I can't be sure but I have a feeling that Sunset is selling refurbed cameras as new. This has been frustrating but in all honesty I rarely have problems with any of my many amazon orders. I will re-update when I get the 3rd camera.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as good as I'd hoped", "Author": "Film Fanatic", "ReviewID": "RSK7I6GR1UBL7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently went on a trip to London, and I bought this camera after doing some research ahead of time. I was looking for a pocketable point-and-shoot that would still take some good photos, better than what I could get with my iPhone camera. While it performed admirably in certain scenarios, I was actually pretty frustrated by it at certain points. Here's what I noticed in pro/con format:PROS:-Excellent optical zoom-Automatically uploaded photos to dropbox when connected to WiFi-Has preinstalled memory, but can store photos on a memory card, too-Manual photo modes (specifically Landscape and Deep Tones) produced some beautiful pictures. I took some amazing photos in York Minster using the deep tones filter, and the shots came out beautifully.CONS:-Flash has to be manually deployed if you want it used-Flash burns LOTS of battery-Bad photos in dark viewing conditions (the iphone camera suprisingly caught much better photos in these conditions)-DIFFICULT FOCUS; inability to manually focus when autofocus wasn't working. This was especially noticeable when I tried to photograph some items in museums that were under glass/plexiglass. (iphone camera was superior here, too)-Deceptive preview screen. Photos looked crisp on the preview screen, but turned out blurry when seen on full computer screen-AWFUL PANORAMIC SHOTS. The camera takes multiple photos and uses a program to sew them together. Other cameras (including the iphone) will do this seamlessly as you move the camera. Unfortunately, the seams between photos showed in every picture, usually as 3-legged people, or repeating pieces of furniture.In retrospect, I probably should've gotten a different camera, knowing the limitations of this one. I definitely don't plan on keeping it as I doubt it'll be useful for future trips.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "FUN and Amazing camera", "Author": "Kippoe \"Kipp Poe Speicher\"", "ReviewID": "RBBFUYP5K2NSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok i admit I'm a bit of a nerd and camera geek and I'm one who doesn't own a smart phone. For years I have wanted to play in the whole Instagram  universe and all the other social networks. This camera/Tablet is a gap in between that bridge, this model is wifi only with no contract so if you have a wireless internet connection your good to go.The camera has some very nice features and gives you great quality pictures, the zoom ability is amazing. I like how you have the option for a tripod mount for those photos that require a steady hand. The camera is easy to use with touch screen highlighting focusing so you have some control on your shots.The set options on the camera have some interesting variety such as long exposure for a light blur from headlights on the street along with an interesting water flow setting. The fast shutter works well as long as you have a lot of light.The manual camera control are also nice to have but a tad bit clunky but there if you need a special shot situation The ability to download other apps from the android store is a feature that really makes this camera shine.With Apps like HDR Camera and Vintage Camera that allows you to shoot video and photos to look like a Super 8 camera. I really like the integration of Facebook Gmail, and Dropbox where you can easily upload and share photos right over your wifi.The ability to upload right to my Flickr account (Pulp Life) is a dream come true with all my interaction and friends on Flickr I'm instantly connected. And finding a group on Flickr just for this camera was nice to see what others are pulling off with their cameras.The battery life for me is around 3 hours but it is a large screen, along with it is a bit hard to see in direct sunlight. I really like the ease of use going back and forth between shooting and viewing the photos. With a push of the button you can view the picture and zoom into it and then just tapping the shutter button your right back into camera mode.The flash has a easy access with just a push of the button it pops out instead of going into camera settings to turn it off or on like my Canon Powershot", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera for non-Smart phone people", "Author": "Never pay retail", "ReviewID": "R338A3TIP5NR61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, it's true.  I do not own a Smart Phone.  I get by just fine with my old school, pre-paid flip phone.  Do I envy those who have the entire World Wide Web in their pocket? Sure-but enough to pay $1200 per year?  No way!Enter the Samsung GC110 Galaxy Camera.  Not only is this a feature packed camera with what our family calls \"stalker zoom\" capabilities, it has Android and Wi-Fi built in.  It has all the features of a Smart Phone (except the phone) and no astronomical monthly bill.THE CAMERA  What I like:  You can choose to shoot in full auto, expert or preset modes.  The presets are designed to give great results for specific situations like Landscape, waterfall, sunset etc.  You can also shoot using effects for sepia, impressionist, comic and produce some really unique shots.  Menu navigation is done through the touch screen and is pretty easy to figure out, though it will take some time to learn it well enough to make changes fast enough to capture a moment .  As an alternative to the touchscreen, you can activate Samsung S Voice(tm) and speak commands for the camera to execute like \"Shoot\", \"zoom out\" or \"record video\". The 21x zoom is amazing.  Just make sure to have your resolution on the highest setting for the best result.  It's also nice that the camera has 8MG of internal memory in addition to a micro SD slot to accommodate high rez pics.  Tip:  Make sure to save your address book to the camera's memory rather than to the card so it will stay with the camera if you swap out film cards.  What I don't like:  1.  The pop up flash is a disappointment.  Even if you have the flash set to auto, you have to manually deploy the pop up flash or it will not fire.  I'm going to have a lot of dark pictures because I'm used to the flash just doing it's thing without having to think about it.  2.  The only way to recharge the battery is by plugging the entire camera with a cord to either your computer to a USB electrical outlet.  You'll need to get extra batteries and an external charger or be severely limited in how much you can use the camera.  See below for my recommendation of what charger to get.  3.  Much of the camera operation is touch screen only.  I'm going to have to invest in some touchscreen gloves for cold days.  You can't even turn the camera off if you can't use the touchscreen.  You can use the voice commands for some functions though, if you need to keep your mittens on.BEYOND THE CAMERA  What I like:  It is very cool to be able to instantly share pictures, provided there is wi-fi available.  It is also extremely handy to have internet access on the go without lugging a laptop or tablet around.  You can edit your shots right on the camera: crop, rotate, adjust color or apply borders or special effects after pictures are taken and the screen is actually big enough to be able to see what you're doing.  Then you can either e-mail or upload them to Facebook, Dropbox or your favorite time-wasting social media site with ease.  The camera comes with a voice search feature for Google that works like Siri.  Ask for \"pizza restaurants\" and it will use the built in GPS to return results based on your location.  There are some apps included- maps, navigation, weather and a host of others I have yet to investigate.  My favorite so far is Paper Artist.  You can take any picture and apply a range of different textures to make it look like a needlepoint tapestry or an oil painting.  What I don't like:  I haven't found any way to set preferences on e-mail.  For example, I'd like to only download today's mail or recent mail not every single e-mail since I turned it on a week ago.  I wind up downloading mail I've long since read on my laptop and deleting it so it doesn't fill up the camera's memory.ACCESSORIZE  I recommend the Hyperion Samsung Galaxy Camera EK-GC100 Charger ASIN: B00APZ8PF2.  It is 10 bucks less than the Samsung charger and comes with 2 batteries instead of only one.  I further recommend the rooCASE Neoprene Sleeve Carrying Case ASIN: B004SOYRE4.  The custom cases for this camera look clunky and bulky and don't look like they even have pockets for extra batteries.  The rooCASE is a perfect fit and provides cushion and protection without adding any weight or bulk.  It also has a zipper pocket to securely hold extra batteriesIN SUMMATIONThe camera ships with very little documentation.  Though it's fairly intuitive, you'll want to go to the Samsung website and download the user guide because I guarantee you'll learn some things you would not have figured out on your own.  While there, download the Kies software on your computer, which enables cool stuff like uploading your Outlook address book to the camera.  I'm sure there are a ton of features I have yet to discover on this camera.  What I've learned so far is enough to let me give it a hearty recommendation.  I've been having a blast with it so far and I'm betting you will too!", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and Easy to Use", "Author": "Scott Hilgadiack", "ReviewID": "RCN3G3ZCTABRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the easy of use for the camera.

As an incredibly busy and yet lazy person, it was easy.As cameras got better and cheaper, I went to a snazzy purple JVC Everio, Cyber Shot, and a too complicated Canon Rebel.Remember that I mentioned laziness?After all that, I began to use my iPhone, and all the others are collecting dust. No more hours of editing, transferring, formatting, connecting to a laptop, etc.Even with the external lens, the quality isn't the best, but who cares? I'm lazy!I started to care, so started to research. This camera has been around for a while. Amazon indicates it was released for sale on its site in 2004, not THAT long of a while, clearly an error. Anyway, the original was re-released WITHOUT a 3G/4G connection in February of this year (2013). Translation...easy-peasy quality at a lower price.This beauty in gleaming white has the best of all worlds. Choose from thousands on thousands of apps...apps for editing, posting, and more. Over 600,000 droid apps.If you've used any tablet, any smartphone, this will be like an old friend the first time using it. If you haven't, you'll be amazed at the ease of learning the ins and outs.Equipped with a good(but not great)lens, large camera/touch display. If you want a tiny camera, get one, but it will have a small display. If you're looking at this, you probably want this size, in every way.If you do YouTube, Dropbox, etc., it couldn't be easier. Most common apps are preloaded, shoot your video and select via the touchscreen where you want it downloaded.But even speaking as an iPhone gal, all the great stuff above, when combined with the #1 android device on the market today (the Samsung Galaxy), is pure magic. Talk about a dream marriage!I went with the protection plan after reading how some people with the previous version had cracked the screen after dropping.Lazy AND clumsy.PS...If you have any questions about this camera I may be able to answer, just leave a comment and I'll do my best to help!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera is amazing.", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R3NTVPE3E8FS0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I was going to my favorite football teams game in a city half the country away.  It was probably a once in a decade trip, and I wanted to record every moment.The night time feature was amazing as I took pictures of the downtown skyline, and all the different old neighborhoods, but it was during the game when it excelled!  The slow motion recording was just like a TV replay, and the action feature was cool too.  You could make some really cool GIF files and have a little moving out of that too.I am not a professional photographer, and wouldn't know a F stop from shutter speed, but with this camera I don't need to.

I was very surprised at how great of an experience it could be.The GREAT:- Runs Android!  My work app runs on the camera which means this could be very useful for people who need to capture vital images on the go, then email or sync them back to the office.- Social is built in. With Android's sharing capabilities, you can capture a great picture and immediately share it with your friends. Now you are guaranteed to have the best food pictures of everyone you know. ;)- The 21x zoom is quite good. I've gotten so used to digital zoom on my phone, that it is easy to forget just how great an optical zoom is at capturing good pictures from a short distance away.- The screen is really nice. It is great to be able to see your images in such a large resolution, immediately after taking them.- You can make capture images/movies and immediately edit them, without the need for a computer.- Battery life seems great. We've used it over a couple of different trips and have not run out of juice while needing it. I've been pretty impressed with this, especially given the battery has to power the mechanical zoom, the aperture, and the large screen, in addition to the OS.The OK+:- Because it is a phone screen, it can be difficult to see the screen in direct sunlight. I compared the camera with my phone today, at the beach, and I was impressed. It was much easier to see the camera screen than my phone.- The buttons are all really well placed, but it can be easy to accidentally hit the screen while trying to use the camera, which could do a number of different things based on where you hit the screen.The IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER:- The size of the camera is a little large to fit in your pocket. It does fit in mine, but it would have been nice if they could have made it slightly smaller.- The camera is a little heavy. Again, making it a bit smaller would have helped with this.Overall, I really like this camera. Is it worth $400?  If you are looking for a great point and shoot and think you would find the connectedness of the phone fun, then definitely yes!  It took great photos and my wife and I have had a blast playing with all of the features. Think \u201cpaper camera\u201d with an actual camera! You can get a quality camera for cheaper, but I doubt you will get as much fun out of it as you will with this.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good choice for the average photographer.", "Author": "Arto O. Szabo", "ReviewID": "R2OS0YR23U3E15", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a semi professional photographer. I got quite excited about this Wi-Fi camera when a fellow traveler used it and asked me to take picture of her with this camera. Later I read all the overrated specifications on the camera and decided to order it. After receiving it learned all the different features and took hundreds of pictures to test the camera. Most of the features worked great but some of them were quite disappointing. The camera comes in a neat small box but without a manual! Only a few very simple instructions are enclosed on how to take your first picture. You have to go to Samsung's website to download the 177 pages manual. The manual is well written and I highly recommend for everybody to read it page by page and to test every feature.The camera is larger and heavier than the average point-and-shoot cameras. It fits easily into a jacket's pocket. Love the large 4.8\" display screen, which is quite bright and easy to read. However outdoors, especially in sunny conditions it is very dark and hard to see or read anything. You have to pump up the ISO rating if you want to take any decent picture in dark conditions. At a low 100 ISO setting the photos will be dark! The 21x optical lens is just acceptable for me. The pictures are blurry at maximum zoom setting.The Wi-Fi connection is terrific. I was able to send pictures via email at least 50 times without fail. Works flawlessly with any one of the apps on the camera. You must make sure that you have Wi-Fi connection! You can take (panoramic mode setting) several overlapping photos to create a panoramic photo, which is stitched together in the camera. The resulting wide photo looses its sharpness. You can get a much better, sharper panoramic photo if you take several overlapping individual photos and stitch it together in Panorama Maker app. or similar other programs. The camera is a power hog, especially if you take a lot of pictures with flash. Must keep a fully charged extra battery on hand.This camera is a perfect choice for a novice or average photographer, but be prepared for a lot of learning and testing.Sharp eye eagle.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Video focusing ruined our family memories; other features are cool, but is it worth it?", "Author": "Truth Teller", "ReviewID": "R7DRUQMI07ODO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I thought this camera was amazing, right up until the video focusing problem ruined the recordings of both of my children's holiday performances. Here's the issue: during a video recording, if you'd like to zoom in (or out) on your subject, the camera can't handle the refocusing. The video becomes completely blurry as the camera tries to focus and refocus and ultimately fails to get back on track at all. The first time it happened during my son's program I thought it was operator error. The second time it happened during my daughter's very first ever preschool dance recital, the focusing problem was so bad that I had to turn off the camera and restart it in the middle of her performance. We are now missing about 30 seconds in the middle of her 3 minute ballet dance. The camera we trusted to capture a family memory as important as this outright failed. We have spent some time trying it in other situations and found similar focusing issues when you use the zoom. We are very upset about this and will not trust it for important videos in the future.The camera looks cool, and has an amazing large crisp and clear display on back. Although it's quite heavy for the size. The lens has absolutely amazing true zoom capability (for taking pictures, don't zoom during video, as I stated above), and this high-zoom lens adds to the weight, so it's a trade-off for the feature. We did actually use up the 8GB of space, so we added a micro SD card for more storage.Taking pictures and sharing photos on the camera is a breeze, and the highlight of owning it. It's super easy to take a snap and share it by email, facebook, or your social network of choice. Loved this feature, because the photos from this camera are higher quality than my cell phone snaps. And the wireless feature worked great. I have to say it's a little strange owning a \"stand-alone\" camera that I can check my email on though. There are a few security issues with this, so I definitely recommend setting up the lock code screen. Otherwise, if you lost your camera you could be screwed by a theif.If it wasn't for the video focusing problem we encountered, we'd really like this camera. However, you'll have to decide for yourself if you're willing to trust your important family vid caps to a buggy focusing mechanism.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "J.

After using this camera for a while, I am pretty sure that Android is the future of point-and-shoot cameras, if not all cameras. A big touch screen, wifi, and useful apps are much better than the clumsy old camera interfaces of the past.GOOD:- Superzoom lens. 21x zoom, starting at really wide angle. Not something a phone will be able to do any time soon.- Wifi connectivity + apps like Dropbox, Google Drive, Youtube, Flickr, etc means your photos can be backed up on the cloud immediately, or shared directly on Facebook, Twitter, and so on. I don't use a wire to download photos from this camera. By the time I get to my computer, the photos are already in the cloud.- Android and universal app support. Think of this as an Android phone which can't make calls. It can run all the apps you care about. Including Skype if you really want to make calls :) You can do all sorts of photo editing on the device using various apps. And you can check email, social networks, etc.- The whole interface is touchscreen driven and well designed. Usually a purely menu-driven UI sucks, but Samsung has pulled it off well here. I do wish there were a dedicated video button however.- You can pause and continue videos, creating a mini-movie with cuts between scenes. I had not seen this on other photo cameras before.- Relatively flat and compact. The huge 21x zoom lens folds neatly into the body and it is self-capping like any point-and-shoot. The camera fits in a back pocket or jacket pocket nicely.- Takes portrait oriented (vertical) videos, unlike other cameras. Video looks great, by the way.- Does not go overboard on high ISO in auto ISO mode (800 max) and it prefers to take lower exposures and still take the shot than go crazy on the ISO. Interesting idea, and I like it so far.- Standard micro USB charger like most Android devices. The battery charges inside the camera, like a phone.- Nice hand grip allows one-handed carry and use.- Decent built-in HDR (high dynamic range) and other useful modes.BAD:- Short battery life. This is probably the biggest shortcoming of this camera. I don't know if I can rely on it for a day trip or a weekend trip. I will try to put it to such a test before deciding whether to keep it. Android says 70% or more of the energy is used by the big touchscreen. Even dimming the screen and turning off GPS and Wifi have not helped much in my early testing.- Feels heavy. Definitely heavier than any other point-and-shoot I have played with lately. It is also a little thick for pants pockets. It fits, but not as easily as a phone.- HD video limited to 30fps.- Burst mode (multiple frames per second) does not seem to work well. It is slow, and after the first few frames, the rest come out dark, nearly black. As a result, this camera does not stop action well, esp. indoors.- I find myself using 1x - 2x zoom more than other settings. I wonder if this justifies keeping this camera compared to a zoom-less phone which would take nearly identical photos.- Small sensor has its limitations. It is hard to take really sharp, crisp, noise-free photos with this camera, especially indoors without flash. It takes nice photos on par with other point-and-shoots, but not on par with an SLR. You are paying here for a very flexible Android device rather than a fancy camera.- Auto white balance is a little off. It is a little warm indoors, and a little cool outdoors. Nikon 1 does a much better job. This Galaxy camera does a better job than the fancier Samsung NX series, however.VERDICT:- The jury is still out on this one. While it is probably the best point-and-shoot camera out there, I wonder if it is good enough to keep when compared with my phone.- If you want to own a futuristic camera, buy it. Every good camera in the future will have network connectivity, social networking, cloud storage, touch screen, and powerful in-camera photo editing.

But you may have also been on the fence on whether or not to purchase this Camera.  Well I'm here to tell you that the Samsung Galaxy Camera has surprised me and I would purchase a second one so both me and my wife could have one if it weren't for the price point.Pictures: The pictures are excellent.  I've had a lot of point and shoot cameras and a lot of semi-professional cameras and lenses.  This takes better photos then any point and shoot camera I've ever had.  It may have to do with the lens being optical, or how the software chooses which auto photo mode to be in, but I have been very satisfied with the pictures I take.Videos: I have taken quite a few videos with this camera.  We purchased this camera primarily to do vlogging.  While we have only composed 2 videos so far, it did a great job in both.  I was quite surprised on how good the video quality was.  It is perfect for our vlogging of family outings and adventures.  I noticed that sometimes if audio is going on before you start taking video, sometimes the audio needs to be adjusted higher during editing.Computer Interface:  The interface for the Camera is done though Samsung Keis.  I've tried both the software and the browser based versions.  I found that the Keis software sometimes hangs and doesn't connect to the camera.  You may have to reboot the camera or software.  But the browser interface works excellent every time.  I was hoping for something a little more automatic.  The Camera does feature automatic uploads to dropbox, but I prefer to place them on my computer before uploading to our website.Camera Software:  This is Android.  You either like it or you don't.  We have tested all the features to include games and email.  It all works just as Android normally works.  We now only use it strictly as a camera.  The camera does go into standby, but it boots even from a complete shutdown very fast, usually about 2 seconds.Camera Body:  I was also impressed at how the camera felt in my hands.  It is built to feel very ergonomic and natural in your hand.  It feels like you actually have good control of the camera when you are taking pictures.  But the camera does have some size and heft to it.  But you should know that it is the size of a Galaxy S4 before you purchase.  You aren't just going to slip it into your pocket like you would your phone.Overall I would highly recommend this camera to someone who wants good quality video and picture capability, wants something better than a basic point and shoot, and most of all likes the Android OS.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ingenius Device!", "Author": "Brian M.

Its way more than a camera, I prefer to call it a multimedia device that is built around a camera. Yes it is very impressive and it's hard to give this innovative device less than 5 stars because of all that it does.UPDATE 12-30-2013I took this with me on a week-long trip to Mexico right before Christmas, I am quite disappointed at the resulting photos!Although it has a host of settings, in many cases, I used the \"smart\" setting feature due to time restraints and ended up with over half the photos that are blurry, or washed out, some appear very soft.One day I spotted a pretty and unusual red bird sitting on a tree about 20 feet from me. I took about 15 photos of it and not one came out in focus even though I used the spot metering. A message appeared a few times on the screen to announce there was not enough light to achieve what I was trying to do. Really? a bright red bird in bright sunlight?It did best with Landscape photos and photos of children. A hyper puppy came out blurry on \"freeze-frame\" and smart setting!I usually take a small Nikon with me, on smart or people settings, it takes lovely photos all the time.As I mentioned in my original review, I have an older Samsung camera that takes amazing photos with beautiful colors! for all of Samsung's efforts to turn this into a \"do everything\" device, some/most of the photos are a big disappointment!The video I shot was excellent, and I used the wifi a few times when I was in a hurry.What I like.Nice large screen makes taking photos easy.Custom settings are remarkably easy to use, with explanatory help as you go along.The built-in WIFI make is easy to share photos.The built-in WIFI allows the user to do anything a smartphone can (sans phone calls)Easy to transfer photos to your laptop or other device using the Kies software or share via social medias.Very good battery life, for such a large screen, I am impressed!The Bluetooth works very well, it has a very handy headphone socket.The photo quality is just average, its good enough for a point and shoot, but nothing special. I actually have a three year old Samsung P&S; that takes simply amazing photos! This \"camera\" takes just average pics.To make this device save the photos to an external micro SD card, you will need to do the following;Click the HOME button, go to apps, then click \"my files\", then \"camera\" then clicked on the icon at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.  It brings up a small menu, I clicked on settings, and then I scrolled down to \"set image directory\", selected \"external SD storage\" card, ditto with the video, clicked done then RESTARTED the camera.... and it works!I actually like the large size, love the big 4.8\" screen and think that this camera will set a trend for larger cameras...The video quality is actually excellent, there is little or no zoom noise, it takes smooth very high quality video which is the best I have seen yet on a \"camera\" and is very easy to use.My biggest complaints are that there seems to be no manual available. Even though I am really a gadget geek, and rarely need a manual I have had issues saving photos and video t my memory card and had to fiddle for over an hour until O got to the settings..What I don't like'''Asides from having to fiddle for an hour to set the external  memory card, there is nothing I don't like about this camera,  it is an ingenious device that I enjoy using, it does not wow me so much as it should, and I have to admit I prefer my Nikon P&S; over this  for taking photos....but I am very impressed with this device overall except for the photo quality.....Bottom line, if you love gadgets, this will be right up your street, if you really want strictly a camera, you may want to look elsewhere.....", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Underwhelming!", "Author": "AZ in Dunwoody \"Allen Z.\"", "ReviewID": "R1QOI9NOVR7UBK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was underwhelmed:PROS: 1.

Definitely a 5 star camera for that; however, the camera like most point and shoot camera low pictures have too much noise.  A docked one star for the low light performance.I have been shooting with Digital SLR since 2004 and have had many point and shoots over the years so I am particular when it comes to a good photo. If you do not plan to make large prints then the low light pictures will not be an issue for you.How the camera shines.- The Screen - The screen is large and has good clarity. The touch is responsive (4.8\" and 1280x720 resolution)- Zoom - 21x - The quality of the photo at 21x is acceptable.- Video Recording - The video quality is good.  It is full HD 1080P.- Wifi / GPS - With so many businesses offering wifi hotspots this camera is a social media star. You can share your photos and have location information- Android OS - So this may be a negative to some but for most this sells the camera. The possibilities are endless because the access to APPs.  Of course you can always allow your kids to play candy crush on the camera :D- Dropbox account.  You get a 50GB dropbox account for two years.  Would be better if was lifetime. You will need to either renew after two years or downgrade your Dropbox accountAreas that lack- Boot up time - Because the camera is using Android OS the boot time is not seconds like most cameras.  So make sure you turn on the camera prior to taking your pictures that way you are ready take the picture at a moments notice- Low Light - I already mentioned this.  You can use the flash but the flash washes out the picture.  The camera has a night scene mode; however, there is still too much noise.- Learning Curve - Not being a typical camera you should take your time to understand what the camera can provide.What I would have liked.- Having two S4 phones in our household we have extra batteries.  It would have been nice if this camera had used the same battery.  I will be buying an extra battery for the camera.I definitely recommend this camera", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!

I've never been disappointed by the products delivered by the company.  My wife and I own Samsung Galaxy phones, so I was excited to get my hands on the Galaxy Camera.  Since I understand all the nuances of the Android operating system, I won't delve a lot into it, but it does allow you to do everything your Android phone can do - on the 4.8 inch camera, itself!  The only thing you can't do is make phone calls (via broadband).  You can download and play games, check email, use GPS, etc.  It's great!  Now, to the camera.I own a Sony Nex 5 camera that takes excellent photos.  The Galaxy Camera is for my wife, who now carries it everywhere with her.  The camera is so simple to use, I'm a little jealous comparing it to the Sony Nex 5.  The photo quality is EXCELLENT.  You can adjust modes on the fly, and their are so many modes that you will want to try them all just to see the different effects.  My wife took photos in very low light, without the flash, and the pictures came out great.  Videos are also sharp and clear without the shutter lag you get from inferior offerings.  I'm really blown away by the ease of use of this high tech device.  If you don't ever want to see the Android system or the apps, you don't have to.  This camera is thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S4 I have, and I would have a hard time justifying a \"camera that has apps\" in my pocket, but it is the perfect device for my wife who is the constant video and photo taker in the house.  One of the best applications on the phone is the ability to send the photos directly to Dropbox (via WIFI), and transfer photos via wifi to your Samsung devices.

I mainly shoot in manual mode with my SLR.  The wifi and android apps capability with this camera is great but  what makes this an excellent camera is the *Expert Mode*.  This camera would be useless to me without that mode.  In the Expert Mode, you can VERY easily adjust the ISO, aperture, shutter speed.. and I don't remember what else.  I don't have the camera on me at the moment.  But because of these manual settings, I am able to take excellent pictures in low-lighting.  Things that you would need a fast lens at ISO 1600 to take!  I was amazed by the low light quality.  Unfortunately, for those who don't know how to use the expert mode, it'll likely be a hit or miss for them in low-light situations. Also, the zoom quality is excellent, even when zoomed all the way.  Video quality is excellent too.  Even videos in low-lighting.  Wow.  But again, I have to stress that I get SLR quality mainly from using the Expert Mode.  I rarely use flash and I do like how I have to manually pop it up when I want to use it.I've gotten very impressive \"professional looking\" concert videos and pictures in low-lighting.  If you're an avid SLR user, the Expert Mode will come very easy to you and you will be pleased with the quality of the pictures and videos whenever you have the exposure dialed in correctly.  The zoom is really awesome!I've had some technical issues and annoyances with Android (I'm an iPhone gal), so hence the 4 star rating.And a bonus, everyone always looks at your camera because it looks like a smartphone but it's not.

Byers", "ReviewID": "R3T5K8YBJRPR6P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is kind of a strange device.  This is the wifi only version of the Galaxy Camera which means it has no cell phone data/voice reception.  So basically you have an android device (and quite a fast one, quad core, etc) that is thicker because it has a hand grip and a camera lens 'bolted' on to it.It's a great idea in concept, have a camera that runs android, which means any camera app can be used, filtering, auto upload to dropbox, facebook, twitter, etc, etc.  However there are definitely some downsides.  The largest one being is that if you haven't used it in awhile, it takes 10-15 seconds to boot up and turn on the camera.  If it is just in standby it takes only a few seconds, on par with most cameras.The screen is huge and beautiful and has a great touchscreen.  The zoom is 21x which is insane, but it doesn't have any image stabilization so it gets incredibly shaky at the long range, making it almost impossible to focus and get a smooth photo, you'd definitely need a tripod or mount for this.  Overall the photo quality is better than your standard phone/tablet, but not as good as a standalone point and shoot camera unfortunately.  As an android device it's great, except it's really bulky, and hard to hold because of the lens.  So if you primarily want a smart camera, then this is it, but you take a hit on quality and price.  If you want to use it as an android device as well then it's quite large to use and hold, but otherwise good.Like the title says, I have mixed feelings on this, doesn't seem to do an android device well or a camera well, while seeming to cost more.

The higher ISOs are not very good but I've owned a Canon  and  a Nikon and they had similar problems but not quite as bad. The downside of the camera is two fold. One is battery life and the other is video but on the video side I didn't like  my 1500 dollar DSLRs either so a camera is a camera  not a video recorder if you want that I suggest you buying a camcorder not a camera!

From the voice controlled commands to take pictures, or zoom, or begin recording, to the auto pre-set formats for shooting under different conditions, this camera can make anyone look like a professional.

Setliff", "ReviewID": "R1SCPT8NPRVFVT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The pictures can be sharp and possess a good quality. But in certain lighting settings such as a vehicle interior or a confined space in a residence, its automatic adjustment feature does not adjust the brightness accordingly and it lacks the crisp feel of outdoors pictures. Add to that, the camera has problems with hardware and software, and susceptibility to failure. Its customer service tech support people are incredibly obstinate, difficult to deal with, and following some scripted responses and will go in circles endlessly and pass you to other agents.Here's how things faired for the Samsung Galaxy. I thought enough positives of this camera in some ways that I was willing to purchase the same model again, because we were acclimated to using it at our business. So we ordered a new camera but wanted to get the one we had serviced since the zoom mechanism malfunctioned. Whether that was a software or hardware issue remains unresolved. I followed the tech support agent's instructions to commence a factory reset, which eventually negated the functionality of the OS altogether and it was rendered inoperable and we could no longer navigate it. Because of the obstinacy and uncouth rudeness of their tech support supervisor Sheila, et al., and their refusal to accept the recent purchase back absent my providing them with some identification number internal to the camera's software, I am not doing business with Samsung again period. They actually were involved in the 'but for' causation of the factory reset, so the onus burden should be on them to accept the product that was recently purchased for servicing.Samsung tried so much to obtain market penetration for cameras, tablets and smart phones, that it sacrificed quality customer service and warranty service. It repeated what Dell Computer did, which was grow too fast at the expense of quality. Overall, I would not recommend purchasing any Samsung product anymore.We're going with Nikon now having experimented with Canon Powershot and others.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "James F Campbell", "ReviewID": "RTRMCSTBSUCYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very good camera for use as a property manager.
