These are not one and the same. DSC-HX300 belongs to a totally different series than DSCH300. What is more, DSCH300 seems to be one of the poorer products put by Sony on the market and there are complaints from all over about it.*** Though it looks like a clone of DSC-HX300, that is a wrong impression*** DSC-HX300 offers 50x optical magnification while this one offers only 35x optical magnification*** Technical support is non-existent for this productGood Things:*** The camera is easy to use*** Highly intuitive*** The flash has to be turned on manually, which means you can conserve battery life*** 35x optical magnification is something significantI recommend that the potential buyer consider Sony DSC-HX300. I have been using it now for one year and have only good things to say about it.Of course, if you are on a budget, then this camera is just fine.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IN8DWU6"}}
