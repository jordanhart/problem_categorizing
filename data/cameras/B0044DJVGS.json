{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Average Camera, Good Price", "Author": "Mom of 3 Great Kids", "ReviewID": "R23VSX5ERJBQJR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, like the first review, I purchased it on Black Friday. I actually purchased two different cameras and I am in the process of determining which one is better...I decided to \"up\" the stakes on the comments about photo quality. My old camera is a Samsung L60. Great little camera, but it's getting beat up and old. So I thought I would take advantage of the sales yesterday.So, what I did was take a series of photos from sitting on the sofa with each camera so I had true, side by side comparisons.This is what I learned...Out the window shot of leafless tress at max zoom... Nikon hands down had the better photo. Put my beloved Samsung to sham. Better Color, Better Clarity, Better everything across the board and this was at Max Zoom (Optical and Digital on both cameras).Next was an indoor photo of my computer. No zoom, about 3' away on generic auto program modes. Samsung's photo dominated this round. The Nikon photo was completely washed out, our tan sofa looked cream and my black computer looked gray.Next was a shot across our family room at our fireplace, 12' away, flash on and optical zoom max. Samsung won by slight lead only because of the color saturation, photo was soft. The Nikon's shot was sharper, but considerable darker, the flash did not carry.Last Shot was the same fireplace shot without flash. Nikon won this due to it's clarity. The Samsung was very blurry. Both had poor color saturation.MP comparison... My Samsung was a 6 and the Nikon was a 12. The Nikon was slightly improved over the Samsung in actual photo quality. I thought it would be a bit more of a visual difference, but it wasn't.Flash... The Nikon Flash didn't seem to travel pass about 8 feet. It only seemed to have one level of power on the flash regardless of how far away the subject matter is. The Samsung made it across the room without issue.Lag Time... Nikon much much better. The Samsung was about a 2 sec lag time compared to the Nikon which I didn't even notice.Flash Cycling... About the same. Takes a few seconds.Final thoughts... It's a good average camera. I paid $300 for the Samsung 4 years ago and the Nikon is $70 for pretty much the same camera with better lag time. So, it is worth it? If you are looking for a generic camera to take mainly non-flash pictures I think this would suit you very well. If you are taking a lot of indoor photos in need of a flash I would shift your attention elsewhere.Hope this helps...", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Eh...", "Author": "Adam J. Brown \"Adam\"", "ReviewID": "R2IZB6T1K13CN4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked this camera up for $80. It was on sale; generally you will be able to pick up this Nikon for about $100.I've used it briefly, but since Black Friday is upon us, and many shoppers are looking for affordable digital cameras, I thought I'd try to help you out as much as I could...so please keep in mind that my use of this camera is limited.To sum it up, it's a $100 digital camera. I don't think one who's familiar with digital cameras would buy it, and think \"Boy, I sure got a steal!\" The image quality is adequate enough to capture moments that you'd like to remember, but if you're somebody who likes to take landscape shots, and capture images that you find to be interesting, and maybe you'd even like to enlarge some of those shots...you should probably pass on this camera. The images are quite soft, and the edges in the image are rough if you do any significant cropping (40%-50%). The movie mode is adequate, again, for capturing those moments that you'd like to remember; if you like to take allot of video, you'd probably want to pass on this camera, for something that does a better job.The menu is really easy to navigate, and overall, it's an intuitive camera.It is quite small, and light. Somebody with big hands may find it a bit awkward to hold.There are a few nice in-camera features, such as color alterations (i.e. B & W, Saturation, etc.), D-Lighting, basic image retouching.Overall, it's a digital camera, that takes OK Pictures, and OK video, for an affordable price. If I were to give this camera as a gift, I'd probably give it to grandparents, or a younger child (14-ish)...or somebody who wanted a digital camera, and wasn't too picky about the quality of the pictures and video.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for the price!", "Author": "Lee W.", "ReviewID": "R3V6YPFZ0PFTL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has a lot of features for the price. I am a longtime Canon fan, and I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and quality.  I bought this camera for my wife and I so we don't have to take a big camera with us on trips. I didn't like Nikon cameras in the past because the controls were not intuitive for me when I am taking photos.  My wife likes a camera that is easy to use, and this camera is easy to use. For people that like a lot of features in a camera this one has it. It won't have them same photo quality of a DSLR. However, it will give you 12mp quality photos--Which is amazing for a little camera. You can easily change the image quality from 4000x3000 down to 640x480. It has a glass lens instead of plastic one. I like the control button for navigating to different settings. They are easy to get to and understand. Exposure compensation is one of the many features I like, and it easy to change. One minus of the camera is that the flash output is only good for about 10' or less. Which is typical for compact cameras.For most people I think that this camera will be a great choice.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good compact camera", "Author": "Nicholas Thompson \"Beernose\"", "ReviewID": "R2U6PNHD7R25NL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera packs a lot of electronic wizardry into a small package at a good price point. This is the trickle-down effect of many years of good Nikon innovation.While its diminutive size is awesome to keep it in your pocket or in your purse for those \"OMG, who has a camera?\" moments, its not a premier class camera to use for mission critical shots.  Its a hobby camera or a just-in-case camera.  And for that purpose, it works very very well.  For outdoor shots in good light, the picture quality is excellent.  If you know a few things about photography, you can make this camera do a lot with all its features.Indoor shots in low light is where things get murky but its all a matter of experience and perspective. My 5 year old Olympus camera takes great shots, but my old Olympus cannot even successfully TAKE a shot that turns out in a lot of low-light conditions. Based upon my experience with this Nikon S205, if you're getting rotten pics from this camera, then you should attend some amateur photography classes to understand lighting, scene framing, shutter speed, f-stops, etc. The basics still apply.  This little Nikon uses some electronic tricks to allow a novice to snap off shots in areas they really shouldn't. The result can be slightly grainy shots in the dark areas of the photo. Improve the lighting of the scene or adjust the ISO setting to a maximum of 400 or 800 and you get much better results.That said, it serves its purpose very nicely. The video recording capability of this camera is also very good (and it saves the video as .AVI files which I like better than other formats)", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera!", "Author": "tmagcorbin", "ReviewID": "R21B0GPNT6LC98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter got this camera last year at christmas. Its a wonderful camera. Its takes super pictures. The video function is awesome too. I like the fact that the charger runs off a cord instead of batteries.

I bought it because our family have a few Nikons that I all like. With this price, I don't have high expectations for this camera. However, I took a few pictures, I decided that the camera is not usable and return it on the same day. The focus is slow and not always work in lower light situation. It was gloomy outside. All the pictures were blurry because the shutter speed was something like 1/10 second. I can only get to its largest aperture (3.2) when zooming out wide. In that case, the pictures are acceptable. In door flash pictures are blurry (or noisy). Maybe, this camera can give reasonable pictures outdoor when it is sunny. However, there seems to be very few situations that I can use this camera to get reasonable pictures. My ten years old Sony S85 6M pixels gives better pictures.I guess I have to pay more to find another camera.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not worth it", "Author": "Mary Anne Whiteley", "ReviewID": "R2881WZ0DWOMSN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had a number of digital cameras over the years, but this was my first nikon purchase. I purchased at Target on Black Friday and definitely regret the waste of my time waiting in line to get such a poor camera. I liked the size, the color and the price and that it had a rechargeable battery. This purchase was a gift for my 11 year old daughter. I made sure to get a case for it right away. Well, inside the case, the darned LCD cracked, rendering the camera useless. First, you discover that unlike most digital cameras, the lcd is exposed, as opposed to being covered with a hard plastic covering. Then you do some research and figure that maybe you can replace the screen yourself for about 20 bucks, but WAIT, there is nothing for this model. Oh, and I forgot to include that when I went to register this camera, it's listed as a gray market camera, which means Nikon doesn't honor the warranty on it. I think this is highly unacceptable.

Every single picture I take either turns out so bleached that you can hardly see the faces, or the lighting is really drastic and uneven-- I think the pictures look awful.  The thing also has occasional trouble focusing.  I would not buy the camera again, I gave it to a family member and I've switched back to my old 2006 camera again.
