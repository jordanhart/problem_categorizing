In some cases, the 100mm Macro\u2019s AF system will not attempt finding focus and will not react or move at all.THIS IS NORMAL.  IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOUR LENS OR YOUR AF SYSTEM IS DEFECTIVE.  THERE IS NO NEED TO RETURN YOUR LENS OR YOUR CAMERA TO CANON.Do not throw the baby with the bathwater.  There are two options to easily resolve this problem, but first, a little background explanation about the nature of the issue:There are fairly common issues with most AF macro lenses when there is a need to focus instantly from 2 inches to 200 yards (or vice-versa).  When a lens is that far out of focus, and the background on which the AF is attempting focus is totally blurred, the AF system will not find sufficient contrast and will simply \u201cgive up.\u201d  This happens mainly with Macro lenses, because of their extreme auto-focusing range and requirements.  Auto focusing problems also occur when there is insufficient light (again a common problem of macro lenses due to high magnification) or simply insufficient contrast.  To avoid situations where AF lenses keep \u201chunting\u201d (searching) for focus endlessly, Canon has buried in the firmware of many of its high-end cameras a software switch that simply disables Autofocus when there is insufficient light or contrast to reach focus.  THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOST MEMBERS OF CANON\u2019S TECHNICAL SUPPORT STAFF DON\u2019T KNOW ABOUT THIS FIRMWARE SWITCH AND WILL THEREFORE RECOMMEND LENSES OR CAMERAS (OR BOTH) TO BE RETURNED FOR SERVICE WHEN THERE IS IN FACT NOTHING WRONG WITH THESE LENSES AND CAMERAS.Of course, there are sometimes real focusing defects, but in the case of the 100mm Macro, the vast majority of so-called focusing problems are very likely due to a lack of experience with Macro lenses or a lack of knowledge of the Camera\u2019s firmware options.HERE IS HOW YOU CAN RESOLVE THE \u201cSO-CALLED\u201d FOCUSING PROBLEM WITH THE 100MM MACRO (AND OTHER CANON LENSES):1) The first option available to most high-end Canon lenses, is to utilize the manual focus override to move the focus ring towards focus (closer of farther), at which point the AF system will take over and achieve focus properly.  (Please note that manual focus is highly recommended for any form of Macro work anyway).2) The second option is to modify the AF control in the Firmware of your camera: From you Camera Menu, go to Custom Functions: C.FnII:Autofocus. Lens drive when AF impossible. > Continue Focus Search. (This is option 6 on my Canon 6D).I believe it is C.Fn. III #1 on the 5D Mark III, where it's called \"AF/Drive when AF impossible.\"Please note that other cameras may call this option something else, or may not have that option at all. With the Focus Search ON, the camera will keep looking when it can't find sufficient contrast to focus. (I.e. it will keep \u201chunting\u201d for focus).  Set this option to OFF, and if the image is totally out of focus, the camera will simply hang and give up (unless you help it out with the manual focus ring as explained in option #1 above).You may want to revert this setting as needed, if you are getting too much \u201cAF hunting\u201d with your other lenses \u2013 particularly if you are using lenses that do not offer a manual focus override option in very dark conditions.Please note that in most instances, the 100mm F2.8L Macro IS USM, is an extremely responsive lens that focuses almost instantly.  It focuses faster than my 24-105L and even my 70-200 F2.8LII.  Focusing with this lens is certainly not an issue, once you understand how to utilize it and how to configure your camera.  It is one of the sharpest lens in Canon\u2019s line of L glasses and good value for money.  The only minor issue I personally have with this lens is the fact that it is built of high-grade plastic instead of metal.  The lens is fairly light, but does not feel as solid as most other L lenses.  Furthermore, plastic being not as good at soundproofing, USM and IS micro motor noises are also more noticeable.  The 100mm 2.8L Macro is indeed a fairly noisy lens (particularly with IS turned ON).  The plastic construction and noise issues are reasons I am not giving this lens a perfect rating.I have written to Canon and have requested for a notice to be included with the lens documentation explaining the focus issues and solutions described above.  (I have not heard back from Canon yet). This would avoid for many lenses to be mistakenly returned as \u201cdefective\u201d or sent in for service at considerable cost to Canon and/or its customers.  It would further increase the satisfaction level of customers purchasing this lens.PS: Got good support from BeachCamera regarding this issue.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Kit for price", "Author": "PhotoWalt", "ReviewID": "R3TOFNFS3XC7R0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I only really needed the UV filter and the Tripod as one of my backups has a broken clip.  The Lens itself is now my most used Prime I have.Lenses:new Canon 100mm f/2.8L IS USMCanon 50mm f1.8new Sigma 50mm f1.4 (Lens is over rated IMHO) Loud lens and focus is spotty4 other zoom lenses (3 are L glass)The IQ is the best it can get and I have been looking at photos try to decide if it is just because I want it to be better (no it is just better)I have less out of focus images and I have the best dynamic range it seems also.  (yes it is situational but it really looks good)I have not had the lens long and I was debating on the 135mm f2L for many months before I decide I wanted to do some Macro work so this became the easy choice.  I don't think I went wrong with that choice as the extra stop does not bother me too much.My thoughts on IS are for hand holding quick photos which seems to be what I have been doing lately.  The IS does seem to help with lower Shutter speeds as advertised for me.  Like I said before I have very very few throwaways with this lens.Matched with the 5D mark III it seems to perfect.  My 7D also has no issues but the ISO noise seems to be much greater on the 7D at even ISO 400-800.  I don't know if it is the lens on the crop frame or something with the 7D and this lens.  Other lenses EF-S 17-55mm is perfect on the 7D without the same noise issue. (strange)  Don't be discouraged by this if you have a 7D as I have not tested it much (one shoot) and it could have just been something with the 7D settings.For what I need it for it won't be going on the crop frame much anyway.Long story short this is my sharpest lens and I have some lenses that I love.  When wide open or stopped down this thing just performs.  I can't see softness even at f2.8 anywhere with many different shutter speeds.  I will be doing some macro work soon and will update the review as I'm just learning Macro which seems to be much different then my normal event and portrait photography.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it.", "Author": "Santanu Chakraborty", "ReviewID": "R3RYUT514R51OG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is good.
