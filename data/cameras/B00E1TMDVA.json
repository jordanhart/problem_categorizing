I bought 2 of these and upon playback of the videos they were all unviewable 1/3 of the screen was normal, 1/3 was blurry and the other 1/3 was green and purple. I tried several times with both cameras to no avail. The customer support is non existent meaning you have to email and wait for a reply leading me to believe they got tired of people calling in about problems. Returning both and going to get a GoPro. And for what it's worth, cameras get hot while using and one came scratched up. Here is a clipping of the email sent to me by Looxcie customer support obviously showing the camera is no good.In any case, the LXHD has been discontinued so it would probably be best to return it for a refund.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not Ready for Prime Time", "Author": "Willie Lassiter", "ReviewID": "R271IYU3MKT9S4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Great product with too many fatal flaws.1) The mechanisms for holding the micro-SD card is poorly designed, and it took me 5 minutes to seat the card the second time, and I even thought i broke the clip.2) This camera runs hot, always over 100 degrees during normal use3) The included mount is very loose, very flimsy, and impossible to tighten, so the camera's position and change without you're knowing it very easily.4) The apps for both iOS and Android aren't finished. They crashed often and I was never able to playback video, even though I was able to record most of the time with no problem. But then, sometimes the recordings would just stop.5) Transferring files via USB is painfully slow, and yes, because they're HD video, they're large files, which is to be expected. But while doing a large and long video transfer the unit reaches and temperature of over 110 degrees and shut down in the middle of the transfer. So that's just not good. Can't take the SD card out too often, and can't use USB to transfer the videos files, and can't watch the videos on my iOS and Android devices either. And so, there we go, deal breaker.There are a view good points however.1) The ability to see what you're recording on your iOS or Android device live is invaluable, because all of these action cameras lack viewfinders.2) The video and audio quality was very good, if not excellent.3) Aside from the poorly designed included clip mount, and the very poorly designed, built  and constructed SD card holder, this camera is very well made.So, if not for the over-heating and random shutoffs when transferring files, I would have kept it. Again, I really like the live view on my iPhone and iPad, but both ways of transferring files off of the device are flawed.I also don't need the live streaming functionality. In fact, it just gets in the way. It may be a great selling point for Facebook fans, and if that's what you're looking for, and you don't plan on transferring your files off of the device, this just might be the product for you.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Owned for a few days now, good product", "Author": "sem", "ReviewID": "RYYHM3QANPNGG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent 1 day messing with this product so far and I am very pleased with its performance.Video Quality is very good for being less than half the price of a GoPro.Picks up Audio well too.  7/10 so far, not tested this well enough.The hat mount is loose, you will need to continually check to make sure it is pointed the right way, wont fall off your head though.the outside of it is scratched already and I haven't dropped it yet..  This is only a design flaw, weak surface maybe?  not sure.Indicates on the front if recording (red light)  so you cant really spy on people with it, Although it mounted to my blinds in my house and recorded the intersection out in front very well.Only notable Cons are how hot the device can get while in use or charging and the fact that the battery is worse than your Cell Phones.  - I will be using the Looxcie (looksy?) camera for flag football this spring and summer, look for further updates as to how this product can perform under the same circumstances a GoPro would be used.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than GO-PRO", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R3SWT8CJHPIHV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Light and smaller files with 1080P and you can get 720 with 60fps for those fast action vids you can't miss.

I'm very pleased.  Daytime filming at both 720 and 1080 are excellent.  The only night filming I've done is 720 from inside the car and it captured the roadway that was illuminated by headlights but nothing else.  Pretty much what I expected given the write ups I've seen.I'll be using this to capture footage from father son mountain bike rides and will also use this at work occasionally.  I do some work in the bar industry and this will capture some hilarious drunk footage.The wifi connection to the iPhone can be a little tricky.  Sometimes it shows up as a device and sometimes as a network.  The iPhone works as a great viewfinder but having it hooked up by wifi does chew up more battery than when it is on standalone camcorder mode.For what I need this thing is great and a third the price of a GoPro.  I only have the basic package and the cap mount looks like it will be pretty versatile.  I have mounted it to both a cap and a bicycle helmet.  You could also mount this little gem in lots of places with 3m command strips.  The next time I go for a ride I'm going to try this hack.  The only accessory I could see buying is the waterproof case for fun in the river during the summer.If you are looking for another option to film fun stuff with the family this might be for you.  If you are a serious sportsman or videographer GoPro is probably the way to go.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing LOOXCIE videos", "Author": "Luis R.", "ReviewID": "R3JUYIRBY2IMDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being grandparents of 7 kids has made it a lot easier with LOOXCIE HD to keep the memories going for years to come.

Tried re-installing and re-logging in with no luck. Contacted Looxcie and was told they are aware of Facebook problem and there is no time table of when and if a fix coming.Edit #2: Looxcie reached out to me and made things right. Sent me the missing accessories and had their IT department working on a work around the Facebook issue. Camcorder records great video and LOVE the Instant Clip to catch my 7 month old son's antics. Grandparent's are happy to watch him live via \"Livestream\" on Facebook. (Parents aren't tech savvy, don't want a smart phone, otherwise I would use Google+ or Facetime).

I had the originaly Looxcie which, while unable to shoot HD quality, I found to be much simpler and more dependable to use. The most frustrating difference was the lack of control over lighting settings. This camera is supposed to \"automatically\" adjust to low light, but does it very poorly. I have shot videos in low lighting that I later found out were completely too dark to even bother watching. The original Looxcie allowed you to set your preferred lighting options and would have shot these same videos and lightened them up for you. Most of my disappointment, however, has to do with the new Looxcie APP that you have to use. I hate the interface and don;t like this idea of making your videos available for anyone to watch. Also I had to contact support 3 times just to get the phone up and running, and most of their responses were extremely unsatisfactory. Regarding the lighting issue they literally said \"No one else has had a problem with it!\" Oh, and BIG DISAPPOINTMENT: after getting the camera I found out that it wasn't even usable until I purchased a separate memory card! It was completely useless. Like buying something and then getting it, all excited, and finding out it said \"batteries not Included\" without you realizing it. This was a big waste of money for me.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Records good", "Author": "RevBobH", "ReviewID": "R2W3Z96WFGNAYJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A great little camera, but after I bought this one I noticed one that would have been better and at a cheaper cost.
