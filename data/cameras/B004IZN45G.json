I must say it has some pros (which are few) and cons(which are many) if you plan on recording around an hours worth then you shouldn't get this. you run out of battery before you actually run out of space on your memory card.Pros-Shoots 720p HDsupports HDMI outputuses muveecan also access videos without muveeno flash or LED lightcons-gets hot after 25min recordingfeels cheap( like if i accidentally step on it, then it will break)too light(lighter then a itouch)body is a very cheap plasticbuttons feel even cheaperflip out usb doesn't always closedoes not come with HDMI cabledoes not shoot for an hour if its on 720p (unless you have an 8G memory card which is not stated on the websites)battery's quality is cheapbattery life gets half way after about 3min of recordingwhen you first put in the SD card for some reason it won't read the card. and to fix it you just blow in to the card slot 0_0. but it doesn't work all the time", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "My unit was not reliable", "Author": "Nacho", "ReviewID": "R3VZUD6H86Z3LD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received a brand new Coby Snapp CAM5002 as a recognition gift from work.  I purchased a 16G SDHC card and tried the camcorder out.  Recording video was hit and miss.  Sometimes I would get a decent recording and sometime I would get an error screen.  Other times the \"operating system\" on this device would lock up and the buttons would not work.  The only way to get it to respond was to remove the battery for a few moments and then replace it and switch the unit back on.  After 30 minutes of playing with it I removed the battery and threw the unit in the trash.  I properly disposed of the battery at a recycling center.  I don't know if I received a bad unit or if all of these camcorders have the same problems.  Either way, I didn't have to pay for it so I'm not out any money.  I believe this product retails for around $50.  A decent HD camcorder will run about $500 so when you consider the Coby Snapp CAM5002 is only $50 it doesn't surprise me that mine didn't function properly.  Good luck if you choose to buy one.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do Not Waste Your Money on this Camera!", "Author": "Ms. Tarr", "ReviewID": "R23USN6XDNT384", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a middle school teacher and I got 7 of these cameras through a donation web site that helps classrooms get materials.
