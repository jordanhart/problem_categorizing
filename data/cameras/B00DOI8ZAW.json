Gergurich", "ReviewID": "R2SYROFOGMOGPI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the lens it works great, all the accessories are a super addition to your camera.  The lens hood works really well, I also have a hard flower lens hood and every time you zoom out you can see it through the viewfinder, so I love this one, because you do not see it at all.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the photo depicting the lens bag is not the one you get,  but the description is correct, it's just a drawstring bag.  I would recommend this product to anyone; it has been a great addition to my camera.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canno EF-S 55-250mm and stuff", "Author": "N. Abdallah", "ReviewID": "R3VTI25UREHQ98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a telephoto that had the stabilization and auto focus feature for my Canon Rebel T3i.I had just purchased my camera and it came with the standard lens of 18mm-55mm. Which is a great lens for pictures that I can get pretty close to. But I needed something that if I was out in nature, I could get some decent shots with a zoom. Not one to want to disturb nature doing its thing.This lens for the price is perfect, a little noisy when using the auto focus, but that is a huge lens its trying to work with.The price was perfect. I also bought the 2 year year protection plan.The squeezey bulb air cleaner is awesome. Love the rubber hood. Nice to have an extra set of filters. Now I have enough for both lenses. The cleaner brush is 'eh, i would rather use the bulb and a cleaning cloth, (one comes with this kit too). Extra lens keeper too!!If your looking for a canon lens with auto focus and stabilization feature at a decent price. Get this one. You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent product and accessories", "Author": "Regina M.

This one fit the bill and I've been happy with it so far.  It has worked fine.  I bought the package deal because it was the same price as the lens alone.  I like the cap holder, the soft case and use the rubber lens shade (wrong name).  I have not tried any of the other pieces so I cannot comment on them.  Overall, I'm very satisfied and would buy again.  However, not being a true photographer I cannot really comment on the lens itself other than it works for what I wanted.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love my lens!", "Author": "kurt", "ReviewID": "R103D4G5FIIBWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with this lens!!

This lens gives me something that has a zoom that allows me to take awe inspiring shots that are sharp as a tack. Now, I'm just an amateur so I'm sure there are better lenses out there, but for the money, you cannot go wrong with this lens. It's amazing what you can capture with this lens. You will definitely impress friends and family with this lens. I was a bit cautious about the \"Import\" tag but I can't tell any difference between the non-imported version. Granted I haven't had the opportunity to compare it face to face, but judging by the images in other Amazon listings this is the same thing. Highly recommended!
