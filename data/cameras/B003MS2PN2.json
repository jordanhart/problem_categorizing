I am sure they make some fine products but this one and the 10 mp camera were absolute junk. All of the photos looked like they were taken with a cell phone and the video it took (supposedly HD) was a complete joke. There are plenty of other cheap cameras that do just fine.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Piece of crap", "Author": "Nikki K", "ReviewID": "R2LRS1T57BQIRF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the biggest piece of crap I will never buy another Vivitar camera, it won't even take pictures and the sd card won't come out now that I inserted it.

It's horrible.  I completely understand the pictures my almost 8 yr old takes being blurry, but even when I've shot with it, flash on- holding it still, everything is till a bit blurry and grainy as all get out.  Don't waste your money- for a cheap camera, this one is probably the worst option out there.  Spend a little more money and get a step up.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera.  Sharp pictures.  No complaints.", "Author": "Char", "ReviewID": "R3EGITU80HTNS7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't understand why customers are not getting better results with this camera and are giving it a bad grade.  I've had no problems with it.  It takes sharp pictures even when I snap a quick shot without aiming carefully.  (Only problem I have with it is when I don't use it for awhile, I forget the procedure for setting the various functions [like flash or no flash, etc.] and then it's a nuisance to have to refer back to the Help guide online.  For easier reference, am planning to print out the manual and keep it with the camera.  If I used it often, I would not have this problem.)Have owned this camera for four years.I think the camera would be too complex for a young child, but I could be wrong.  Maybe would be okay for age 10 and up.(This Vivicam 7022 comes in other colors besides purple.  Mine is black.)", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "WORST CAMERA EVER!", "Author": "M. B.
