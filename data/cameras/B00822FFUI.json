I'm a adventure motorcycle rider and the camera meets all of my requirements.  The package I bought included the camera several lenses, tripod, etc., etc.  The extra lenses are probably not really necessary with this particular camera.  I wished I had bought an 18 - 200 lens rather than the 14 - 42.  I have to change lenses too much in the middle range.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Olympus OM-D E-M5", "Author": "Jamie R.

The two lens kit is a must have, just as with the E-500.  The 14-42mm lens allows you to take pictures at a normal distance.  The 40-150mm lens allows me to take close ups of the children's Christmas program, from the balcony!The rest of the kit has everything to get you going, two nice Vivitar filters, to protect your lenses, a 32 GB SD card, camera case, and more.  I am not impressed with the Zeikos brand accessories.  They are very cheaply made.  If you spend the money to purchase the E-M5, you need to invest in a Slik Pro tripod, and a Promaster cleaning kit.  I haven't used my card reader, yet.  The card wallet is a cheapy, but handy!", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "great bundle", "Author": "victor", "ReviewID": "R2LOLQLFLK53F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Happy with my purchase.Service is excellent.great bundle.Had some problems cutting my screen protector to fit the screen.Should have come in a customized or right size.it does not fit and now has a lot of air bubbles under.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Budget bundle even!!", "Author": "Victor Kwong Chit Kam", "ReviewID": "R2UA9CLSS6LZL0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This bundle just great for newbie like me.
