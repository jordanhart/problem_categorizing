All other items in this kit work like i would expect them too.  all in all i love the camera and the two nikon lenses. I would suggest the d5100 and the two nikon lenses to anyone who wants a good nikon", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Nikon D5100 Bundle!!", "Author": "pinkish", "ReviewID": "R5WFRUTTQ7V3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were going to buy D5100 w/ 18-55 & 55-300 lens in Walmart for $1,026.21 w/tax, in-store delivery in 7-14 days, then we found this bundle in Amazon w/ everything we needed for our new camera for $1,069.90, delivered to our door in 5 days!!!Every item in the bundle was tried and all work great: memory card in the camera, UV filters protecting lens, wide angle for landscape pics, wireless remote control to take family pic, fast memory card reader, nice cleaning kit, tripod was fun for the family, screen protector for LCD screen, beautiful Nikon bag, memory card holder for extra cards, good 2x telephoto lens for long distance objects.We're still exploring camera's cool features, it'll take a while until we master all them, it's been a dream owing this camera, takes awesome pics even when is out of focus... :)Photos in Jpeg format are very nice; in RAW format they are crispy clear (great to be manipulated in Lightroom), even though they take more space in the memory card.I missed super-moon, but I'm waiting for next clear night to take pic of the moon w/ 55-300 and 2x telephoto lens on tripod, without UV lens, then try on couple of adjustments (found tips on youtube videos), and see how the pics will come out. It should be better than the traditional 'light bulb' pic that our old Kodak takes.Overall, we're very happy with this purchase. D5100 is easy to use (for beginners: leave in Auto mode, camera will do the rest), feels nice (not too heavy for girls), has good grip (doesn't feel like it's going to slide off your hands), and the bundle complements the camera for a smooth and delightful experience, worth every penny invested.Note: if you tend to misplace/lose lens' caps, don't forget to buy couple of 'leashes'.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera - Excellent value!", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R12PQFLCI4I9AL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've taken over 100 pictures with my D5100 since I purchased it, and cannot be more satisfied. The kit included two excellent lenses that are absolutely flawless. There were also extra lenses that are meant to attach to the factory Nikon lenses, but I haven't done much with them at this point, as the included lenses do what I need them to do!Additionally, the tripod is very nice, and exceptionally rugged. I love that it has an included carry case, and that makes toting it along with me on the trails much easier.Compared to the D7000, the 5100 holds it's own! With the same sensor, it can shoot just as well as the 7000. It's missing a number of the prosumer features of the 7000, but at roughly $300 less it's more than worth the money.My only complaint is that the included bag is just a little small and cannot carry much more than the items that come with the kit. If you have even one more lens, it probably isn't going to fit in there... unless it's a 50mm prime focus! That one you just might squeeze in!", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "TX Coach", "ReviewID": "R4Y7ABW2E3NM4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera set up when we were moving from Texas to Alaska.  We planned on driving and wanted to make a summer vacation out of the move.  The drive was incredible, Alaska has been incredible and this camera has done an outstanding job of capturing all of it.  I haven\u2019t found that I need anything other than what came in the kit as of yet and I don\u2019t really see outgrowing the camera but who knows I might add another lens or something at some point.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I still think it was a little over priced.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera choice", "Author": "Julio Stirling", "ReviewID": "R269O8XQPEO528", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife was delighted with this present!

I have taken about 3500 pictures using mostly the 18-55mm lens 80% of time during last few months. The pictures were great. However, during my last trip to the Mammoth Cave, the 18-55mm lens stopped zooming, i.e. the lens got stuck and can only move between 24 and 35mm. Upon close examination after I came out of the cave, I found that the front part of the lens became loose and is wobbling within the outer cylinder. After I manually wiggled it a bit, I can again move between 18 to 55mm. It continues to take pictures. Not sure how long it will last before it falls apart.Perhaps, I had a bad luck and got a bad lens. However, I've expected better quality than this from Nikon. This is a brand new camera and lens with very limited casual use. I'm very disappointed. That's why I'm giving it a 2 star.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super deal, awsome camera!", "Author": "Me", "ReviewID": "RAMF7QF1V2516", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera!
