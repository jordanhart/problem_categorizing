This dome cam has a built in LED infer red sensor allowing the red light to only come on when you get to close to the camera; A blinking red light dose not exist on any real security cameras.You could also buy a real security camera and not connecting it - Q-SEE also makes real security cameras so this helps make it more real and from past experience they work as a good deterrent.I added an inexpensive screw on antenna making look more real and placement is also important. Most all dome security cameras have a plastic base, any real bullet type security camera is metal avoid plastic. In buying a plastic dome security camera other then Q-SEE leave the battery's out. The bad guys knows that a security camera with a blinking red light are fake.Best is to buy a motion sensor there \"GREAT\" they work allowing you to know someone is on your property, in your garage. Here on Amazon look for the Dakota at $14.99 looks like something out of the 1950's but works like a charm.

Q-See makes an impressive array of real security cameras, so the decoy fits nicely into their product line, making it seem more realistic.  Batteries and mounting hardware are helpfully supplied with each unit.So what are the cautions?  They are:(1)  It appears the flashing LED mechanism has been simplified to be on all the time. Each of the units I received has a space marked for a flasher on-off switch, but there is none.(2)  A mounting template is thoughtfully included, but in the instance of my units it seems to be for an earlier model because it is quite wrong. I followed it carefully and the lens ended up pointing at an off angle. That's when I realized the holes on the template are in the wrong place. So I ended up having to patch the extra holes in my porch ceiling and start all over again. The template has to be modified to work correctly.  Please note this applies to the template that came with my units--for all I know, others could be correct.(3)  On the outside (!) of the units is a label with model number, etc., and the words \"DECOY CAMERA.\" Clearly this label should have been placed on the top, out of sight. It comes off with isopropyl alcohol.(4)  Don't expect long battery life.  Three fresh AA alkalines last three to four weeks.  I'm going to try lithium batteries, but of course they're not cheap.  It is due to the cost of batteries that I'm giving this product four stars instead of five.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Leon", "ReviewID": "R25XT6GKWAI0HB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera looks like the real thing. Very well made, I'm impressed. I wired it in permanently instead of powering by batteries so never have to worry about batteries going flat when I'm away.Update after 1 year (19 Dec 2013) This camera is still working perfectly with no signs of deterioration. Installed on the back of my yacht and no sign of salt water damage, or UV damage either. Here in the Caribbean with the harsh sunlight and reflection off the water that is excellent.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Dummy/Decoy Camera Ever", "Author": "Book Reader \"Book Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z5L5MIEI0ZAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Q-See is a legitimate security company, so it's no wonder their dummy/decoy camera is the best!  Let me start by saying that the camera \"ball\" is about the size of a \"Magic 8 Ball\"  The camera comes with 3 AA batteries and mounting hardware and a booklet of instructions.What's great about this particular camera is that once you turn it on, it's only going to flash the \"red light\" when it's dark outside, saving you all sorts of AA battery costs.  The booklet says the batteries should last 2-3 months.  You don't even need to have a red light flashing, because it would tend to make the camera look like a fake in my opinion.I've chosen to mount this by the door of my camping travel trailer.  It sits flush against the side of the trailer and if it scares someone off who's intending to break into the trailer, that's fine!  Eventually I plan on getting a legitimate wireless camera and monitor, but until then - this will work.Amazon also sells a twin-pak of these and now I'm sorry I only bought the single unit!
