{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Two Thumbs Up - Excellent to record Action Shots!!", "Author": "Elliot Bernstein", "ReviewID": "R3SVNU15F44CQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I primarily shoot with higher end DSLR cameras.  I bought this camera mainly because of its ability to shoot at 40fps and to have a fun, pocket sized snapshot camera.  It certainly does delivery on its promises, and does a great job of doing it!  It is about the same size as common P&S; cameras but is loaded with great features that gives it an edge over other cameras.The button to switch from single shot to high speed and back to single shot is conveniently located at the top of the camera. Push the button and you are in high speed mode.  Push it again and you have a regular camera. If you shoot action shots and are not good at timing your shots to 'capture the moment', you will love this camera.  If you have kids and they do sports, you will LOVE this camera.The camera can be used in a fully automatic mode, fully manual, or anywhere in-between. Access to all the shooting settings is accomplished by pushing one button as well (on the command dial), so you can adjust aperture, shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation, white balance, frame rate for high speed shootings, buffer settings, etc.  The MENU button allows you to access typical setup features and reformat the memory card.Auto focus is fast and accurate.  The focus tracking feature works, and works great.  Metering is excellent as well giving consistent, correctly exposed images.The lens gives very sharp pictures with nice color and contrast.  The zoom on the long end to too strong to use effectively without a tripod, even with the image stabilizer on.  It is easy to get good 12x shots though.Like just about any P&S; camera, good lighting is the key to success.  Very low light performance is only good at best, but keep in mind it is typical just like any P&S; camera.  If you plan to use your camera in low light often, you may be better off with a P&S; that has a f2.8 (or faster) lens, or a micro 4/3 or DSLR camera where you can put a fast lens on the camera.  The flash works well when needed, providing even, accurate light without hot spots and naturally looking pictures.Video quality appears to be very good although I have not viewed the HD video on my HDTV.  Video can be recorded in slow motion but resolution is quite low and probably only suited to viewing on a computer.  It also requires a lot of light.  Shooting under fluorescent lights in slow motion can produce a flicker effect in the lighting.I have owned several P&S; cameras.  This one is loaded with features that give it an advantage over many other P&S; cameras.  Although it is a little bit more expensive than some typical cameras, because of its high speed image capture features, it is an excellent value (if you need and can use those features, of course).One other drawback is is slow write speed to the memory card.  I did not notice any difference using a high speed memory card to a slower speed card.  This is not an issue for single shots or if you shot in small bursts.  But, if you shoot a burst of 30 shots, you might have to wait 20 seconds for all the images to be written to the memory card, You can of course still continue to shoot (up to the buffer capacity).  You cannot view images while the buffer is clearing.  I don't know if this camera is any faster or slower in write speed to other similar cameras.  But of course, I don't believe there are other cameras that take 30 frames in 3/4 of a second and have to write so many images to a memory card at one time!The panorama mode of this camera is excellent, providing seamless panorama shots with ease - the entire process is automatic.  All you have to do is pan the camera smoothly as you hold the shutter down.I did a side-by-side comparison of this camera Vs a Lumix P&S; that my friend has.  His camera has a Leica lens.  The image quality was basically identical and indistinguishable between the two at both low and high ISO.  I have read a couple of reviews about this camera not giving sharp images.  If you are not getting sharp images, there is something wrong with your technique as the lens on this camera is excellent.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Most fun I've had with a camera", "Author": "Lane", "ReviewID": "RH90I91H628DC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera. I'm not a professional photographer so may not be as picky about all of the smallest details but I know my way around a camera and this one is awesome. I couldn't decide which camera to go with and after reading a few not so hot personal reviews I got a little worried but now I'm definitely glad I went with the Casio.I wanted a camera that shoots 1080HD, this one does it and seems to do it very well. It also has an HDMI output build right in so thats a big plus.I was really interested in the high speed capabilities of this thing as its the only one I could find that has it. Its really revolutionary and is a game changer as far as I'm concerned. I was amazed that the average person could get high speed technology for only $240. Its not perfect as the image quality decreases quite abit the higher frames per second that you go but you can still get very impressive results. The key is to get a lot of light, just the same as what the professionals need for their hundred thousand dollar cameras. I put three or four lights shining on the table and spun a quarter and got really awesome results. It showed up clearly even at 1000fps and looked incredible as it slowly turned. You can watch the unedited footage in amazement so I can't wait to see what I can do after some editing. I'm definitely gonna have a lot of fun with this feature.I read reviews that said the HDart feature is overhyped and useless but I don't agree. Although its nothing too incredible, it does give some really cool results. It instantly turns a regular picture into a work of art of sorts and I think I'll definitely be able to use it to create some cool images.One of the other great features in the panorama shot. I don't have much experience with this so when I first did it I was really impressed. It takes a 360 degree picture and, from what I saw, it stitched them together almost perfectly. Its a pretty amazing feature and you can definitely have fun with it. I can't wait to try it out on some outdoor scenery.Since this little device is also a digital camera I better touch on that, haha. The still pictures were very good in my opinion. The colors were great and really popped. Some people will complain about the sharpness of the images and if you really zoom in, yeah of course its gonna start getting grainy. If you take the picture and are looking at the full picture, however, it looks great. It does a good job of focusing and automatically adjusting depending on the light in the room. Also since one review said it didn't have an autopreview after you take the picture I'll mention that it does, you just have to go to the menu and turn it on.Overall I was very pleased with this camera. If it had cost $900 I may have been a little more picky about image quality but at $240 this thing is incredible. Seriously, if you're gonna complain about image quality, go buy yourself a $2000 canon or nikon. And if you're gonna write poor reviews because you don't take two minutes to learn the menu system and features then ask your grandkids to show you how the thing works first. And if you're just on amazon looking for a great little camera that gives you awesome pictures plus an endless set of fun features then don't hesitate to buy this one.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good video and image quality but image stabilization a problem", "Author": "RIK", "ReviewID": "R1I10I01WRCMHN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros1.

I was looking for a camera which could act like a P&S; for my wife, yet offer high-speed and some other sophisticated features for me at sporting events.  This little gem has met all those requirements extremely well.  The continuous shutter and high-speed features are stunning, allowing me to capture the pitch leaving the pitcher's hand or the ball leaving the batter's bat.  For me, this is a thrilling capability.  I also like the panorama capability.  The telephoto with anti-shake works great, giving clear crisp photos even when my hand is having difficulty holding the focus area on a small item.

There's a lot to like about the camera in this role - compact, lightweight, decent battery life, and easy controls for quickly capturing many videos.Overall quality of the videos themselves are similar to the prior Casio models in this class.Unfortunately, a key feature that was present in the previous model, the FH100, was removed in the ZR100: manual shutter speed selection for the high speed video mode. What this means is that high shutter speeds will not be used during high speed video capture which will cause fast moving objects to appear blurry. While this may not sound like a big issue, for golf swing analysis this is a big miss. A very important part of diagnosing swing issues is seeing what happens at impact, and this is where the clubhead will be moving quite quickly (hopefully). You will not be able to accurately see what is going on with videos from the ZR100, as the entire area will be a mess of blurry clubhead, ball, and maybe airborne turf.There are rumors of a firmware update that would enable the feature, but I won't hold my breath. My next high speed video camera purchase will definitely require an adjustable shutter speed feature.

Korea.  He wrote and told me he was seeing a lot of the coaches shooting this compact point and shoot high speed camera and the results were amazing.  I do a lot of video analysis in my work, and took his word.  I received the camera in six days, and spent one night reading the operation manual and playing with the camera to learn how to initiate the bells and whistles.  I had read some of the reviews that said the \"ease\" of moving around in the camera's program was a problem.  I say...read the information supplied and you will find this tool easy and quick to go from need to need.I shot the camera for a week in Maui.  I took many stills and many clips.  The stills allow for manual settings, but for my part the auto settings were easy and very good quality.  The \"art\" setting created some amazing shots of the ocean, sunsets, and settings around the Wailea area.  I took night movies and got great quality shooting at 240/fps.  Some of my test clips were taken at up to 1000/fps, and while they were good, they were not as clear as the slower but very adequate setting.  The \"panorama\" feature is good, but takes a little practice to master the rate of movement across the field of vision.In summary I would offer that there may be better cameras if you seek to take primarily still \"travel\" genre pictures.

The things I really like about it are:1. the superfast burst mode (up to 30fps). I love to take pictures of sports (baseball, soccer, track and field, etc.). This camera enables me to catch the moment when the batter hits the ball, the high jumper clears the bar, the goalie stops the shot).2. the hdr mode which usually gives me pictures without blackened shadows or blown out highlights.3. slow motion video, though at less than VGA resolution. Good for golfers wanting to analyze their swing, useful for coaches wanting to give helpful advice to athletes on their mechanics when jumping, sprinting, punching, etc.4. The panoramic mode where you can get 360 degree shots at up to 1080 by 9600 or so).What I wish Casio would change or improve are:1. the image stablization (I think Panasonic's is better)2. the resolution of the slow motion video. The older FH100 could do VGA (640 X 480) at 210 or 240fps).If you just want still shots with no HDR, no super fast burst mode, and no panorama shooting, you might be able to get a better deal elsewhere, but the features and the performance of this camera make it a bargain for people like me.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great step up from the EX-FC100", "Author": "William Clinton", "ReviewID": "R19AMWZPYZ33ET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used the FC100 for a couple of years now and have been happy with it.

My theory is to take pictures of people not things. Things seldom change - people do. Anyway, back to the camera. It is great. Many times faster than earlier models. Pictures are great. The panorama mode is cool. The biggest difference for me was the 24MM wide angle lens. It alone is worth it for me. Captures things that I wasn't able to capture before. It retained its pocket size but is just a little bigger. No big deal for me. I had to order a slightly larger case for it.

To purchase a \"professional\" high speed camera would cost several thousand dollars.  The price of this camera was less then the cost of renting one.  Unless you need a faster frame rate then 240FPS this camera should fit the bill nicely plus it is less bulky then a \"professional\" high speed camera.

We don't have time for a lot of post-production so the in-camera panorama and in-camera HDR are very useful.  Zoom and speed are awesome for a camera of this price and this size.  In many circumstances, it can replace my big heavy Panasonic Lumix FZ50.  Another good feature is the macro setting, which is good for taking pictures of bugs.High speed burst with lag correction is fun...it will take 40 pics per second, and can start taking them BEFORE you press the shutter button down all the way.  Warning: You will take too many pics if you abuse this setting.  high speed and regular photography is also possible while shooting video.Great telephotoGood low light performance, especially for something with such a small lense diameter.Of course with this type of camera, no good way to add filters to the lens.  Pretty standard though.Left/Right buttons can be programmed for quick access to your favorite menu function (I use mine for macro/infinity/auto/manual focus)Some minor flaws not worth taking away a star:There are loose parts inside the camera...not rattling, but they can be felt shifting when the camera is moved.  As long as it doesn't break I can deal with that.The camera is hard to grip with one hand...always use the lanyard!

The reviews did not look good but HDR seems to be loved or hated depending on the photographer. What I like about it is, on a cloudy day where there are hit and miss patches of blue sky, HDR does a great job of bringing out some sunshine in what would normally be a dismal shot. And having built into the camera with results appearing in 2 or 3 seconds is phenomenal.Also another reviewer said the camera is fun even though he is a typical DSLR photographer. He is right. The camera is fun, fast and adapts to a wide range of shooting conditions very quickly.The bad news is that it does not work with Eye-Fi cards, as stated in the manual.Also please note that the camera package comes with a battery charge, but no SD media/chip. The camera is well worth the money if photography is your hobby. I have already sent away for a poster size print that I will hang on the wall.

Even with flash still, the flash recovery speed is great. The flash is quite fast (won't hurt your eyes) but the result is great.

Yes Casio.  Casio has the best image-processing software in the business.  The build quality is superb.  The optics -- outstanding.  The battery life -- exceptional.But the HDR feature is remarkable.  The EX-ZR100 has captured great photos in places where my other (10+) digital cameras had always failed me -- for example, on nature walks where there is partial shade/sun, in museums where flash photography is not allowed.As described, the HDR feature \"combines information from a burst of multiple images and unites the most detailed portions of each image (taken at different exposures) for a beautiful, never-before-possible wide dynamic range\".One activation of the shutter gives you a \"click-click-click-click\" of multiple images being recorded and then you end up with a \"merged\" photo that gives you the best image quality across all areas of the photo.  Visible detail (e.g. visible faces) out of shadows, most notably.I haven't used the high-speed capability.  So no comment there.My gripe would be that the between-photo times are a bit slow.  But that is common for most digital cameras, if not all.  (My Samsung NV24HD has spoiled me in that regard.)Is there a perfect digital camera?  Not yet.

I thought some of the features were, well, dumb to say the least, like the \"art mode\" and the \"premium best shot\".  Why not just have one best shot?Anyway, I never got to use the camera.  When it arrived, I was not impressed with its appearance.  Compared to the S10's solid metal machined appearance, the all-black ZR100 looked a little cheap.  Mind you, compared to the other cameras I looked at in the store the other day, it still looked a bit better.  The on/off switch and mikes on top looked like they were afterthoughts grafted on with surplus parts.The camera itself is, compared to the others in this class, not as thick but definitely much bigger than the S10 (which has been replaced by the S12).  The screen is big, sure, but overall doesn't feel that much bigger.But finally, I noticed that the lens cylinder rattles in the camera housing, whether extended or not.  This in a $250 camera!  Anyway this was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I noticed that other ZR100 owners have had the same problem with repeat cameras.
