{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's heat activated, not heat and motion.....misleading", "Author": "S. J McCartin", "ReviewID": "R1TKCKYCZGZSAA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this to catch a problem neighbor trespassing outdoors.  I'm putting it up under my eaves.  I like the quality of the video even in very low light.  The onboard battery doesn't really last long so you need AC available and if you plug it in and can't get any video output reverse the red and yellow plugs on your tv---mine is switched someplace probably on the camera itself but it's no big problem because it works. You have to have a TV with RCA/F jacks to enter the setup of this unit. This thing is not cheap but it's about the cheapest unit of its type that you can find anyplace and some places charge a whole bunch more for this than amazon does.  This unit does not support SDHC only SD so your card is limited to 2 gig which is actually quite a lot of video recording.  You can plug this into your computer and windows sees it with the mass storage driver or you can pull the card out and plug it into any reader to play the videos; you can view files on a computer but you can't enter the setup except with a TV set.I would have preferred they make it a little more weather resistant but those seemed to cost more.  This looks like a motion detector for a outdoor light, I'm going to hang it up under my eaves to watch my driveway area, it should be ok there and protected from the elements I just have to hope stupid doesn't figure out what it is and take the card out of it because it's pretty obvious what this is when you're up close to it.", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Do exactly as advertised and more", "Author": "T. Koo \"\"review\"\"", "ReviewID": "RPAGHBLYR0TTT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This item was surprisingly compact with full of features.  Similar items in the market costing almost the same price lacks features like date and time stamping; recessed SD card slot; IR for night vision and PIR for passive detection.  On top of this; this unit has a builtin rechargeable battery.  There are so many features that I have yet to test but the video was very crisp; usually items like this have grainy video. Even has a remote control to alarm the unit.Alas, the instruction was pretty poor for a complex item like this. Otherwise this is a 5 STAR product.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Versatile", "Author": "Randolph A McCord", "ReviewID": "RBLDH5AYFJPTF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great gadget! After recording, I can watch it on my TV or on the computer. The instructions are written by a non-native novice English speaker which is entertaining to read. The night vision is not so discreet as the IR LED's glow to illuminate the subject. That is sure to capture the theif's attention. I am going to use it to capture a theif who enters my apartment while I sleep. Once the village police examine the evidence, I doubt the accused will be free for long. It records video clips, but not still pix. There is a 1-second delay between detection and recording.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "It works more than I expect.", "Author": "J. Lee", "ReviewID": "RVAKB0B3F21ZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I feel I am lucky to choose this one after I did many research on this kind of products. I got it about three weeks now and it works very reliable and I have got many many useful, important AV recording.  The things I like are1. only one second delay once detects the motion and start to record video and audio. Almost nothing missing at all.2. Camera sensitivity is very good on indoor and totally dark condition.3. Remote control to arm/dis-arm or manually start/stop.4. direct connect to TV and on screen control.5. good enough size internal memory and can use external SD card.6. motion detect signal also can wirelessly connect to my main alarm system.7. time stamp.There are also some limitation, but this is not important to me, and consider the price, this is an excellent product.  The only thing I am not sure is the operating life time so far.The limitations are1. Camera can not work on strong direct sun light area.2. embedded battery can not sustain long, such as over night.  Either need to attach the AC power adapter or just plug in a large capacity battery yourself for long period monitoring.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't buy the 4G card offered when you buy this", "Author": "Merf", "ReviewID": "RL4I3DUZ4AIH4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Warning!

It is a little hard to hear the audio, however, if you want to simply spy on something(someone) This is the camera for you. It goes unnoticed until you mention it is there.

It was in the package in a messy way appearing to have once before been returned and quality control missed it.  I believe that possibly it was returned prior and placed back in the warehouse.  Anyway I hired a man who hooks up technical equipment to hook this up for me and he could not get it to work and he was of the opinion that I had, that it was a returned item before I got it.I believe that it is a highly ethical company as I returned it as per their instructions and was immediately given a full refund.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost usless.", "Author": "Narayan R", "ReviewID": "R1AS8ZUAX7JAWJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Doesn't work as advertised.
