I have done pictures in both dim and bright indoor settings, and outdoors at noon and dusk.  It takes very good pictures, with a very good color match.  The only items it did not get well were some art glass items in a dim indoor setting that are hard to capture anyway.  The software was easy to install and use.  I have a 450Hz Pentium 1 and the camera uploaded 60 pictures, some at maximum quality, in less that 5 seconds.", "Date": "November 1, 2002"}, {"Title": "Best Digital Camera for the Price Anywhere", "Author": "Jenny from Toronto", "ReviewID": "R3U04MQQSEALAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera. It's by far the best value in a digital camera. I spent ages comparing features and prices. It has better resolution and zoom - 2.1 MP, 3 X optical and 4 X digital than cameras manufactured by the well-known camera companies, and for about half the price. The auto-focus, red eye eliminator etc. work very well. Out of the 400 shots I took the first three days I had the camera, only 3 were underexposed. The camera can take good, clear pictures of very small objects (12 X zoom, distant objects, interior, exterior. The silent movie option also works well. My only beef is that the batteries supplied with the camera only allowed me to shoot and upload about 400 pictures. So I recommend buying rechargables. This has replaced my older Cannon Eos Rebel.", "Date": "January 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"microtherion\"", "ReviewID": "R1ATYQBGZ6QNFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I'm not the world's greatest expert on photography, I'm very pleased with this camera. I find optical zoom very important, and this camera provides a 3x zoom at a very good price point. The pictures I took came out quite well, and the handling is convenient.Two minor nits are that the camera feels very plasticky for its price (but so do all other cameras in this price range, it seems), and the built-in amount of RAM is not going to give you a whole lot of capacity.", "Date": "February 17, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great but uses ALOT of batteries.", "Author": "Maggie", "ReviewID": "R1RS463XO3RWPX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this camera is excelent!  all the pictures come out beautiful, but if you take it on a trip,  make sure you have alot of extra batteries and a card for it,  the camera doesnt hold more than about 7-10 pictures with out additional space.", "Date": "January 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "Near perfect", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3HCZ6SWPQTTMH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera would be perfect if it had an automatic lens closing device...the lens cap that is attached with a little cord is always falling off!

I am something of an ametuer photo person, and like to take a good photo. I travel, and train dogs, and shoot in difficult light. I push my point and shoot very hard.last night i went and played with this for an hour with a friend, brand new out of the box.The software and printer were coneected. I took ten great pics, in dying december, evening light of a black and white sheltie, with a blue eye. I was impressed at how fast i fiqured out how to run the camera, and how fast i  got the pics out of the computer/ hp printer. and the quality for a evening, december light was outstanding.the soft ware on the computer was similar to other photo shops, the englargement and red eye fix worked great. and pic quality was out standing for a  home printer, this was the hp stand alone printer.my one small problem was editing/choosing which pic to keep on the camera monitor. It really needed the computer to allow me to choose the best shot. i will buy it, and most likely take a class to really be able to run it. my friend is not real computer literate, but i bet she will fiqure out how to run it, she is pleased with the price. office depot, camera, incredible printer, and card for 225 after rebates.Wish I had it in london last week.", "Date": "December 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera for the Price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3SUUPUOUU2D8P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice camera for its price (...).3x Optical Zoom is good, but don't expect anything from digital zoom.

Only 2 Megapixels? 3x optical zoom? That's it?Yeah, I was polite and thankful upon getting it as a gift, but I'll defenitely be returning it with a speed!Before you ever turn on the camera, you'll already be unimpressed. The camera feels very light and plastic-ish.  Weighing in at a mere .46 pounds, this thing feels more like a children's toy than a real $200 digital camera.Then you start taking pictures ...Anyone who has ever had a digital camera before will immediately notice the lack of features and options, and the picture quality can easily be obtained (surpassed, even??) with a much cheaper 35mm.  There really isn't any special features or advanced options to speak of, and the photographer's creative control is extremely restricted.  There is not even a Sepia or Black & White Mode to speak of, so any such editing of your pictures will have to be done on your computer, in a Photoshop program for example.Many things that a serious photographer would like to have control over will be absent.  The white balance, ISO, and the shutter speed cannot be controlled, they are all automatic! This becomes very frustrating.There is also a \"movie\" mode, but I believe it is actually refered to as a \"motion image\" or \"motion JPEG\" or something.  This is because you can't record the video with audio.So really, the best thing to do is never, ever, ever buy this camera for yourself, or loved ones on their birthdays, either.  Serious photographers will find absolutely NO significant controls to take charge over, feeling very restricted.  The camera is simply too simple for them.  Folks new to digital cameras will find themselves satisfied for now, but in a few months when they begin learning more and more about digital cams they will already be ready for an upgrade.  So even for amateurs, the camera is not worth the price.I recomend instead the Sony Cybershot P10.  It does cost a bit more money, but new digital photographers will find a lot of options and controls at their disposal.  Even though there's a bit more to learn with that camera, no one should be intimidated by it.  Sony has made a very easily-accessible camera in the P10.For even more advanced photographers, the Nikon Coolpix 5700 is an excellent 5.0 megapixel camera, with even yet more advanced features than the Sony P10.Both of these cameras will make any photographer, amateurs and serious ones, very happy ...the price is a little higher, but anyone willing to give either a try will realize that the price is definitely worth it.And as for this worthless camera? Anyone could eventually find that this simplified, point-and-shoot camera is hardly worth $200.  I wouldn't pay one red cent for this thing.pea sout", "Date": "July 14, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000069J9O"}}
