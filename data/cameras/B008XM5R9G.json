{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung WB100  smart digital camera SO AMAZING I came back and Bought ANOTHER!", "Author": "Billerica, MA.", "ReviewID": "RBZCOQRZGWZR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did A LOT of shopping before settling on this camera.  This seems to be the closest to the RED/BLACK Nikon L810 Coolpix but I found this camera had more bang for the buck and it seemed to be a newer model too.  So I wondered if maybe Samsung took that 26 zoom and improved on it.  I have seen another listing here where the person didn't get clear pics with theirs. I would say it was THAT individual camera having issues.  Another person complained no clear pix on zoom.  This is NOT TRUE if you know what you're doing. This model has a function where you depress the \"take\" button 1/2 way to \"line up\" your shot.  You will see green boxes appear. They surround key items in the photo.  So you can't haphazardly take a shot, its more designed for a pro where you will line up your shot AND THEN SHOOT. I was AMAZED with the number of special functions this camera had and I was literally jumping up in down with happiness the more and more I found.  I have the camera here now and will list them (or try to list them all...) below, but you need to see the YOU TUBE VIDEO ON THIS CAMERA --copy/paste this to you tube \"Samsung Camera WB100 - Perfect for inspirational shooting!\"This is a great YOU TUBE video that shows you an overview of the features this camera has.on top of the camera is a quick function feature wheel here is what is on itA)SCN includes: 1.Beauty shot 2.Frame guide 3.Night 4.Portrait 5.Children 6.Landsape 7.close-up 8.text 9.sunset 10. dawn 11.backlight 12. fireworks13.Beach&snow;B) LIVE PANORAMAC)SMART (setting for most pix it adjusts auto to all situations and lighting)D)1080di HD VIDEO camcorderE)SETTINGS (sound,dispay,connectiv, general)f)DUAL IMAGE (THIS CAMERA HAS A PICURE IN PICTURE SETTING, VERY COOL)G)SPECIAL FEAT- 1. 3D 2.Magic Frame (sunny day,classic tv,old album,Holiday,Billboard1,Billboard2,Mural,Old film,wave,fullmoon,old record,magazine cover,newspaper cover)3.

Just working with it for a good hour and you should have most the features pretty well down.Recently I took a picture in the complete darkness of a home with christmas lights next door on night setting.  This camera had no trouble pulling it off. I will try to upload the pic.  Also, I LOVE.... the natural looking NON FLASH pics it takes with its SMART setting.  It does have a flash but you don't seem to need it.  The iso settings are so high it picks up the rooms light naturally.  I also took some gorgeous macro pictures of a candle with crystal with a mirror in natural light, another with a candle and the shadows it cast on the ceiling.  I'm an artist so I just love the play of light this gorgous camera can pull off with its crystal clear 16.2 mp pixels.  I will try to load some of these pictures when I figure how, because a picure is worth a 1000 words and these picures are speaking volumes!!!!HERE IS THE COPY/PASTE FOR THE USER MANUAL FOR THIS CAMERA.... it comes with a rather small pamphlet, you will want to favorite this pdf....[...]", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "MoodyMama", "ReviewID": "R21XECIG6RX0HW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from amazon after they sold out of them at Wal-Mart snd the shipping was fast and the package arrived in perfect condition. My only problem is that the listing says the camera is red and that is what I really wanted however I recieved a black one. I was quite disappointed because I chose the red listing from this seller over another less expensive one just so I could have the red but It was black anyways. Overall this is a great camera and I have had no problems out of it and I haven't stopped taking pics with it since I got it. If you want a good camera to take family pics I would reccommend this one all day long.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R28UNCW140R34O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not sure what people are doing to take bad pictures. Mine have all been great right out of the box. Great pictures and a lot of cool features and effects. Good editing software built in as well. Just remember that the further you zoom the more important it is to hold the camera steady. Setting it down or using a tripod works best, but this is true for all cameras not just this one. I've had great luck with the zoom and the wide angle lens is great for family pictures and get togethers. Just a great all around value and very comfortable and easy to use.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my new camera", "Author": "Tiffany", "ReviewID": "R2QDOZY6B4X17W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was so worth the purchase plus I love the color!!! would definitely recommend this product for sale.

Shutter speed isn't delayed what drove me crazy in my other point and shoot. Takes very nice pics and good videos - I am about to have a baby so that was main reason for this purchase. Huge zoom and it actually takes sharp pics too !! just make sure ur hands are steady. About the touch screen - there is no touch screen - which is fine with me but they advertise it so that's a mistake. Overall great camera with enough of zoom and pixels - for normal family use u don't need anything else - as long as u have basic knowledge of how to use it before u criticize it that something doesn't work.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "I was disappointed in this camera", "Author": "Nita", "ReviewID": "RNCS1SOK5YGVN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It was heavy with 4 AA batteries.

The features and zoom are excellent but the quality is terrible!!! The rubber handgrip is peeling off and the Samsung agent inspecting it said 'You must be holding it wrongly and have damaged it by holding it wrongly!!! It is a handgrip! there is no other way to hold it!Samsung and Argos will not repair or replace the camera which is clearly poorly made, there is no damage to the camera but Samsung have little or no so called 'customer service'Buy Nikon if you want quality, I know I will.

I didn't think anyone still sold a camera over $35 that still use's disposable, earth destroying batteries. I was astounded when I'd used the camera for 140 pics and the low battery indicator went on and I opened the battery compartment to find traditional disposable batteries. I guess I get another set of re-chargable's and use them - but they don't seem to have as good battery life as a manufactur's designed battery pack.
