Fazio \"Rude Joe\"", "ReviewID": "RAQGRF42YLSA2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I cut this device a lot a slack in terms of criticism because it was so inexpensive (under $40).  It works as described and, with a little tedious fine tuning, it delivers a pretty clear picture.But, it could be a lot better.  The camera lens zoom and focus is pre-set and not adjustable.  The only way to change the zoom is to physically move the camer back or forth.  This makes finding a place to hide the camera much more difficult and challanging. The mounting bracket also adds to the challenge--it doubles the height of the unit, and is intended to be mounted with the included, tiny wood wood screws.  Using the the knob on the receiver to fine tune the reception from the transmitter is what migraines are made of--keep the Tylenol handy. It's similar to trying to fine tune the dial on an am clock radio with week reception. When used with a Slingbox this camera makes a pretty neat nanny cam--the live feed can be viewed from any web browser or from a smart phone (e.g. iphone, blackberry) and can be recorded to PC if desired.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not the best thing in the world, but it works, sort of.", "Author": "minni", "ReviewID": "R2VO5G5CX52CLP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am trying to go through one wall with this.  I stuck the receiver on my TV and the camera to the outside door of my house (behind the window) I get a good picture and a good viewing angle, but it flickers a lot.  It kinda looks like a surveillance camera in a horror movie.  In fact when i first unpacked it it placed it in my living room and connected it to my tv in the bedroom to mess with it.  It was late at night and I kinda freaked myself out.A few things to note, this is not secure.  If you have a neighbor with a 2.4 ghz video receiver it is possible for them to pick up the feed from your device. These are not outdoor, and they look kind of fragile.  If the focus stinks turn the knob on the camera lenses to focus.  The receiver is wall mountable so you can hang it behind the television with no issue.  I found that pointing the antenna on the receiver tword the camera will make a bit of a difference in the picture quality.  It black and white an does fairly well in the dark.  The microphone has good pickup.My biggest complaint is the video footage looks like something from Paranormal Activity, it has some flicker and scan issues and even when bolted down the image wiggles from side to side a little.It is an okay baby monitor, its okay for seening when the mailman comes or watching those huge bugs flying around your door.  You get what you pay for in this case though.Its been running for about a week and a half on one battery so far with no change in signal quality.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not good", "Author": "Alex Barton", "ReviewID": "RXA84IOJY6TU8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The picture quality was not very good.

Hurst", "ReviewID": "R35R9M3OY3UV3Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got it up and running in about 10 minutes. I like it and will keep it.The biggest two cons for me are: 1) If you go too far from the receiver you get a shaky image, and by too far I mean not that far at all. and 2)Not having nightvision.But knowing I can buy another camera and add to this system, it makes an excellent day camera. Used an extension cord because adapter cord was a little short, and it works great.

This combination is awesome... when it works.  Getting it to work is the difficult part.  What seems to work is a LOT of jiggling of the wires and tuning knob of the receiver.  Prepare to spend several frustrating minutes for a picture to kick on.Wall adapters come with both the camera and receiver.  I am using this system to see who comes through our front door, so the adapters were very helpful for me.  Unfortunately, the adapters are oversized, so good luck putting them on a power.Otherwise, the system works great.  Good picture, plenty clear.  Very quick to set up (if you do not have to jiggle).  The receiver and camera are separated by one wall and approximately 12 feet.  I do not plan to test it at a longer range... just because I do not want to go through the jiggling.Just don't move it.  Setting it up again will be a nightmare.  Note that this may be a problem with the receiver or the monitor; I am using the same review for the monitor as well.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "works", "Author": "g bez", "ReviewID": "R1ZQH4S7H0L235", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "amazon offers a few cameras very similar to this model that I hear just neg. reviews about.....but the lyd I purchased in the past from elsewhere a little cheaper but with shipping it equaled out..........ive used this cam in the past as av fpv and got great distance recpt.......and it really took a beating till I once miss wired it.........but if your gonna buy one of these cameras I recommend you buy the lyd its a few dollars more but it actually works......", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Love it!", "Author": "Paul Homer", "ReviewID": "RRY4O3M62W408", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

The camera is a lot better then what i expected. How ever there seems to be a little interfering when walking between the receiver and camera but thats to be expected. I but this to help with security. Where i work at they decided to tint the front guard house windows. May not be a problem but i work from a 11 at night to 7 in the morning so i cant see a darn thing. I might upgrade to something better later on or i might just buy a inferred light for the camera for better visibility.Side note: Go to walmart and buy a water proof housing for the camera if you intend for it to be out side.
