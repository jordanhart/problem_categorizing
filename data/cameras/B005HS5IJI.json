The quality of the image that it produces is not great. I guess that you get what you pay for. Color is \"off\" and I get color \"blooms\" at the edges of objects. Don't waste your money on this one.. If they had a zero star that'd be my actual rating of this item.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$170.00", "Features": "Enhanced Features and Fine Image Processor\nOSD/2D-DNR/BLC/Privacy Masking; Zoom & focus outside adjusting\nAuto Gain Control; Suitable for wall & celling installing", "Name": "GW Security GW613WD Professional 1/3 inch Sony Effio CCD Waterproof Outdoor or Indoor Security Camera - 700 TV lines, 3.6mm lens, 48 IR LEDs", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31rFOilrRYL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005HS5IJI"}}
