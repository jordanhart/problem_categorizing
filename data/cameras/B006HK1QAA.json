The only thing that is a little hard is learning how to use it. However, with the help of my teenage daughter we've taken some great pictures in places other cameras have left us with very poor pictures. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this camera. The only reason I gave the camera 4 stars is because I think the operation information could have been better stated.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outdoor zooming use only", "Author": "Lisa Wagner", "ReviewID": "R2ECX8I30MJSSB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After I logged hours and hours of research, I selected this camera as my Christmas 2011 gift from my husband.  At first, I was slightly impressed with the ability to take beautiful food photos for my recipe book, but mostly when using natural light.  The flash whites out close up objects, and not using the flash causes my indoor photos to seem yellow.  Outdoor photos come out fantastic, especially when zooming.  I took an amazing photo of my husband and son fishing, while I was standing at a great distance from them.  A few days later at an indoor aquarium, I had a completely different experience.  Indoor zooming typically results in a blurry picture.  There is an insane amount of time between pressing the shutter button and the photo actually being taken.  I missed many potential fabulous shots.  Afterall, we cannot ask a fish to float still! The camera is also rather heavy/bulky.  My neck was sore after a day of it hanging around my neck, while walking around the aquarium.  With so many missed, blurry, whited out, or grainy shots, it just ended up being a heavy piece of jewelry.  As an avid scrapbooker and family events documenter, I think it will be best for me to research a lighter weight point and shoot that can capture moments, whether they are inside our outdoors.  So far, I am considering the Canon Powershot A2300 to replace my Kodak Easyshare C182, whose battery compartment often pops open, throwing my batteries and SD card at inopportune moments.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good camera under the Sun", "Author": "Irvineman", "ReviewID": "R3UC6RODQEACGK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a Christmas present for myself during the after Thanksgiving internet sales.  It took very good picture during the daytime outdoor.  Zoom in and zoom out still yield good quality picture.  It has a viewfinder, under the sunlight it will be easier to position the subject.It does not give good picture if I do not use flashlight while indoor.  I have to balance between aperture, iso and exposure time to yield a satisfactory result.As for battery life, I use the precharged Sanyo AA, it yield 170 pictures with the camera turned on for over two hours and the battery still has charges.Overall, this is a good outdoor zoom camera for the price.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Price for a Great Camera!", "Author": "S. H. Ginsberg \"SHG Books\"", "ReviewID": "R1PZ252HZX1EKK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting to buy a nice, professional camera for a few years, but didn't want to part with the hundreds of dollars that a Canon or Nikon would cost. With some prompting from my parents, I looked into less expensive cameras, considering I'm not using it for a job, but a photography hobby. I found this Fujifilm, which compared with the Canon SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch Vari-Angle Wide LCD, is about $215 less, has 14 megapixels versus the Canon's 12, and has video, which the Canon did not. I got my Fujifilm 4 days ago, and WOW. It takes amazing pictures, sharp, clean, clear, and rarely is there a blur. It zooms up to 24x, and when you do use the zoom, the pictures aren't all blurry like I'm used to with other cameras I've owned.Great product, great price, BUY IT. You can't beat it.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "False Advertisement", "Author": "JonMark", "ReviewID": "R137KAFK28FHW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm writing this review, not of the camera, but of the false advertisement listed on the page -- it does NOT include the 4GB card or the case that it said it came with. It was only the camera and the normal accessories that come in the box. So this really isn't a bundle after all. They should reword the listing here to show that.UPDATE: After speaking with the seller, and then after with an Amazon CSA, I was issued a 20% refund for the camera not coming with the advertised bundle, and they edited the listing here to reflect that the package does not come as a bundle. Amazon exceeded my expectations with this issue. And when wrongs are made right, I will acknowledge that.Now unto the camera itself ... It's an amazing camera for the price (even not considering the price, it is a great camera). I previously owned a Nikon P500, and I already like this camera better. The best difference is the dual stabilization that is in this camera. When I used the zoom on my P500, camera would never focus and it would be really hard to keep the camera stable, resulting in blurry pictures; this FujiFilm is amazing with the stabilization at full zoom - pictures come out crisp and clear without any blur. This is a really great camera, and I highly recommend it - at this price you can't afford not to give this camera a try!", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "great zoom good video and pictures what more do u want?", "Author": "Brian Gittins", "ReviewID": "R197NDL304XZQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i got this to replace a 5 yr old kodak it still works great but i wanted more zoom, bigger view screen and hd video.. i researched about 40 cameras (under $400) and this is by far the best you can get $ per features under $400..  i don't know if the pics are any better than my 6meg kodak (because it has a very nice lens on it)  but they are as good in most cases and it has the zoom i wanted and video and the panarama which is pretty cool and for under $200 it can't be beat.. for $50- $100 more you can nikon or cannons that are just as good as this and they come in different colors but only do it if the name or a red or blue camera is worth more $ to you..  it's very easy to use just make sure your format the memory card before taking pics (its very easy) just click format card when it ask.. the auto settings work pretty well for most pics, flash is good.. you can read manual for 4 months and still learn stuff so dont think you'll be a expert 1st day, just use the auto settings until you learn about the other ones.. blink detection works but it also comes up when someone squints, it still takes photo just tells you so you can take 2nd photo which is smart..  this thing has face rec on it so you can take photo of someone input their name and bdate and if you take their photo on birthday it'll put happy bday on the photo forreal.. so it has tons of stuff most peeps wont ever use but it's loaded enough to keep you happy longer so in 6 months you don't say i wish my camera had that., chances are this one does you just gotta read all the stuff this thing has on it..", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the price", "Author": "Janine Gardner", "ReviewID": "RMOM68PM8PK0M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few days ago and I am very happy with it. It replaced my Nikon Coolpix 995 and this camera already surpasses my old Nikon in features, ease of use and photo quality.The learning curve isn't too bad if you're already familiar with the basics of shooting. The included booklet does a pretty good job of explaining how to get to the various photo modes...and there are plenty of modes to fit every situation.The only thing I'm not crazy about is the battery/card compartment door; it's a bit tricky to close once the batteries are in, and it feels like you have to force it a bit---something I don't want to do with ANY electronics equipment. As long as it's closed slowly and carefully, it's fine...but if you are in a fast-paced shooting situation and need to replace the batteries quickly, I can see where it could become a little frustrating. Also, the lens housing isn't threaded, so you can't easily use additional lenses with it (without buying an adapter), but it does a fine job on its own with everything from product photography to outdoor action shots.Overall I'm extremely pleased with this camera and I think you get a lot of bang for your buck with this one. :)", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value...", "Author": "Ken in Orlando", "ReviewID": "R1K63S7859MHHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 2 months.  Out of the box, on auto, indoors, without flash.  That was my first shot and it was muddy, out of focus, etc.  I was disappointed.  I read the manual, front to back.  I was stunned by the user controls on this camera.  Over the next few days, I shot hundreds of photos using every option on the camera.  The results are truly stunning.  I am 65 yers old and have used just about every type of camera.  The results from this one are far and away superior to anything I have ever used.  The video is super sharp and the sound is excellent. The zoom is unbeleivable, even hand held.  You must take the time to study the manual and experiment with it.  It's not a great point-and-shoot, but it's perfect for those that know their way around a camera and are willing to take the time to get the most out of it.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "3280 Fne pix.", "Author": "Edward Varjean", "ReviewID": "RFUM3HHU8CCLW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased it on sale.  Worth the price but other of my cameras are much easier to use.  I miss a lens hood.  The batteries life is a little to short!  A real minus!!!  You have to use a tripod if you want sharp pictures.  If not use the self timer so as not to have camera shake as you depress the shutter button . The macro feature does not work to my liking  The angle is too wide  for it to completely fill a 35 slide . Leaves too much  space around slide negating the hi pixelcount of 14mp.  effectively  less than a 6 or 8 MP.  Some  movie features and burst modes were unique and powerful.  The panarama  mode is better than on most cameras.  Fuji has a plus in that color rendition is good.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very slow and grainy.", "Author": "Rachel Shafer", "ReviewID": "R3CG8M7JOI0QHH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been very disappointed by this camera.

I know there are people on here complaining that it lacks certain functions or whatever, but if they wanted those things they should have bought a $400+ camera and not tried to go cheaper and get the worlds best DSLR.I have had no issues with this camera.  Like I said before, it is not top of the line, but it is what I could afford and I am very pleased with what I received for the money.  I wish I could have afforded a camera with interchangeable lenses, but the lens on this one is more than adequate for what I use the camera for, which is mostly outdoor shots.  In the summer I was in the backyard with my dogs and my niece playing in the kiddie pool and my niece was throwing water at my mastiff, which just drives him nuts.  He tries to attack the water.  I started taking pictures and was amazed at how clear they turned out for being actions shots just on the basic auto setting.  The pictures always turn out quite crisp no matter the setting or lighting it seems, thought my cats were quite perturbed when I started using the flash in the evening to take pictures of them sleeping on the couch.One downside I can see for this camera is that someone who doesn't know their way around a camera with all these settings on it could get confused.  I've worked with much more complex cameras and much simpler ones, but if you aren't familiar with how to use settings and are unwilling to read the manual or take the time to figure them out by trial and error without getting frustrated, this camera is not for you.Overall, like I said before, you get what you pay for.  This is what I could afford and I am more than pleased with how well it works and how good the pictures are that it takes for the money I spent on it.  I would recommend this to others who either don't need a super fancy camera or want a good DSLR camera on a budget.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't beat it for the price!", "Author": "iamlarrymurph", "ReviewID": "R2LA61EVKXVC5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying I do not write many reviews. In addition, I just purchased this camera a few days ago at the worlds largest mart (department store). Apparently they are getting rid of some of the Fuji cameras, and this was one of them. It had a sticker price of $179.00, then below was a clearance tag of $159.00. HOWEVER, when the cashier scanned it, it rang up $99.00! So it was a no brainer. That (the price) is what I'm basing my review on. For $99.00 this camera is absolutely phenomenal! Pictures are nice, clean, and crisp! It also as features that allow you to control the aperture, and the shutter speed independently. The 24x zoom is sexy. And for a point and shoot the flash is immaculate. With the various shooting modes, scene selections, image stabilizer, and face detection, for under $100 there is NO OTHER CAMERA that will afford you so many dslr functions on a point and shoot camera. Truly looking forward to growing and learning all that this camera can do!", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "S3280", "Author": "Rich", "ReviewID": "R1U8CA6SOZ7GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a great camera for the price.
