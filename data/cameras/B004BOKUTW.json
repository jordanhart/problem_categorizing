{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great features for price", "Author": "techie99", "ReviewID": "R1S5EKF2JMLC32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I compared all 8 channel DVR/Camera kits in this price range and found this MACE product to have the best set of features for the price.  The cameras are good quality and have a surprisingly good viewing angle.  They look very nice mounted since the hole for the cables is centered under the mount and not visible.  This is also one of the only 8 channel DVRs in this price range that has 8 audio inputs if you want to add upgraded cameras with mics.  Cameras also use BNC connectors so it's easy to use cameras from other manufacturers.  The user interface is pretty intuitive but the instruction manual is weak.  I had to call and get some advice on setting up the remote viewing feature but it does work.  Overall its a great system that's been up and running continuously for a month now.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$856.00", "Features": "4 Indoor/outdoor cameras with night vision\n1/3 inches CCD imager\n3.6mm lens\n420 TVL lines of resolution\nEvenly-distributed night vision for up to 50' with 18 IR LEDs", "Name": "Mace 8-Channel 500GB DVR with 4 Color CCTV Bullet Camera System Kit MDIY-DVR084CKIT", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E-MEl5nBL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004BOKUTW"}}
