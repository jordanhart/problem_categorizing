The video is clear, the zoom allows you to see what you want and its easy to install and set up.  The night vision is good for the range that I am using it with, the only thing that I have noticed is the IR reflects off of the clear dome a bit.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "pretty good camera!", "Author": "Gpujic", "ReviewID": "R690B2K893CJM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I installed two of these at my private school last year and they have been doing fine ever since. Easy to install and worked well out of the box. We've gone through one winter with them so far and no problems.If you are on a budget and this camera fits your price range, it is a great camera. Obviously if you can pay more, you can get better quality cameras.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for day time - Bad for night time", "Author": "TZ", "ReviewID": "RMQ1MYGOBISIB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the pair of cameras to add to my existing cameras. During the day time they were perfect - like looking thru a window. At night time there were lines in the picture that were terible. I contacted the seller and was advised to check the power output and that it might be cheap cables and I replied to that message that the cables had been supplied as part of the purchase and I also asked how the sound was supposed to be connected since there were o instructed to go to another link where the information was explained. But I was instructed again to check the voltage at the end of the cables. the cameras, power supply, mic's and the cables were all supplied - why do I have to check the power suppy (even thou I did). I have purched several other camer's from Amazon and have never had any problems like this and yes I have had 100' cables before with no trouble. I am very dissapointed with this whole thing with Amazon. I have purchased one more camera and if I have any trouble with this one - I will go to another seller of camera's (one where you bid - you all know who that is).", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$929.95", "Features": "Image Sensor: Built-in 1/3\" Sony Effio CCD.
