{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Top-Notch Pictures, Easy to Use", "Author": "T. Fonte", "ReviewID": "R3OZ67JLG26CH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my Z712 a week ago and have taken over 600 pictures with it. It is pretty small (though not pocketable) and lightweight. It is a fast, accurate-focusing camera. The 12x zoom is fabulous. It has an Auto mode that evaluates the shooting conditions and subject and chooses the correct scene mode automatically; in my experience it is quite accurate. You can use it as a point and shoot or make your own aperture, shutter or completely manual settings. The high ISO on the camera does a nice job--even my worst shots at 1600 are usable (with a little help from Neat Image). There are almost no ruined shots due to camera fault (photographer fault, yes). The colors are definitely Kodak, but not as saturated as some of their cameras have been. There is plenty of detail in the photographs. The CRV3 battery lasted over 500 shots with frequent flash and LCD use. It is a camera with a great combination of qualities and few faults. A picture is worth a thousand words, so in case you want to see some actual production from the camera, feel free to visit my Kodak Z712 IS gallery at pbase. Just search for the camera and tgaf. I have posted over 80 photos of various types there.", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money!", "Author": "Narut Ujnat \"Enthusiasm is contagious.\"", "ReviewID": "RXSLY5TXT5LW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to upgrade my little Olympus point and shoot from 2002.  A great product as I detail below.This Kodak is a great camera, and for the money delivers unbelievable features.  This camera is not just a simple point and shoot, but rather it is an advanced amateur camera with lots of features to go from simple point and shoot to more manual features such as choosing exposure time, settings for certain types of light and even video with sound.  You can easily choose - with one button being pressed - between the digital viewfinder or the larger LCD screen for taking the picture.By using the wheel on top of the camera, you can easily access all features.  The camera comes with a proprietary battery, but you can use standard AA batteries in a pinch, although standard AA batteries probably won't last long.The lens has 12 times zoom with digital zoom taking it to 18x normal.  The camera is certainly larger than a point and shoot, but it is fairly small - about the size of your hands if you cup them together to make a bowl.PicturesThe camera takes some outstanding pictures that make you seem like a better photographer than you probably are.  Colors are vibrant and come out beautifully.  7.1 MP gives you sufficient range to zoom into a picture of you want without too much grain.DownloadThe camera uses a standard SD memory card.  I bought a 2 GB and 1 GB card for use with the camera and on the highest settings a 1GB card should give you about 300 pictures, quite a lot for almost any situation.Downloading the pictures onto your computer is fairly easy - using a included USB cord.  However, I must say that the instructions are not as clear as they could be and I had to figure out some features by trial and error.  This included how to look at the pictures on the camera without having the lens pop out (go to features and press on and you will be fine) and downloading the pictures to the camera the first few times (you have to put the cord in order before the computer will probably recognize the camera for download - frankly my Olympus was easier to accomplish this task)ShortcomingsOf the few shortcomings this camera has, I mentioned the confusing download which is not intuitive at first (I admit I actually had to look at the directions).  Second, sometimes the auto-focus will take a few moments to capture the subject you want - again not a real huge issue but it is noticeable. And I suppose that is really the only issues I have with the camera.  It is a good product.ConclusionGive the price, if your looking for a camera which can serve as an all-around platform for simple picture taking to more advanced features giving you manual control, and in a pinch a decent video camera to take video with sound limited only by memory -  than look no further because this is a great camera.  For the money it is a very good deal! I am very satisfied with this camera.", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "You will not be disappointed.", "Author": "mrsmel2010 \"mrsmel2010\"", "ReviewID": "R233Y4ZQEUUFHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After seeing that this camera was not immediately available on Amazon, I went to Staples and bought it.  It was one of only two available, and I am lucky to have found it.  So far, I have been extremely impressed.  It takes excellent pictures in a variety of scenarios, but I have been most impressed with its ability in low light situations.  Standing in a completely dark room, it makes photos look like it is daylight.  The zoom is fantastic.  Although the camera is completely automatic and adjusts to the appropriate settings, it allows the flexibility of a manual camera, which is perfect for the amateur photographer who wants a little more out of his or her camera.  If you are looking for a simple point and shoot, it might be a little big and complicated, but if you want more, this camera is perfect for you.

The camera is capable of excellent pictures, great zoom range, exceptional video, and all at an excellent price in a very small package, but I do notice some problems.Worst is batteries-The camera can deplete NiMH rechargables just sitting for a few days. The unit comes with a nice lithium ion battery but it is NOT RECHARGABLE. Nor is a recharger included. If you use lithium ion 's you will get good battery life , but they are expensive! If you use rechargables other than Li-ION you will get very poor battery life (40-50 images). AND I found it hard and expensive to get Li-Ion rechargable batteries and especially a working charger. On that note avoid shopextreme.com - they rip off alot of customers.The camera does very well in good light but has problems focusing in lower light. (It helps to select macro or distance settings to aid focusiing) Sometimes it just won't focus (then go to manual). Sometimes it won't snap the picture, and that's frustrating.The LCD is very bright, the menu system is very good, The image stabilization is very good. There are a lot of features and manual controls.The zoom is amazing for so inexpensive a camera. At full zoom  I recommend a tripod. I could actually get clearer long distance pictures from the z712 that I could from my Canon 350d with a 300mm lens. (Don't get me wrong - overall $1,200 of DSLR and lenses are a much better platform)Concluding: for the price -amazing possibilities, but spotty performance in lower light - worst are the battery issues", "Date": "October 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Kodak Fan!", "Author": "P. Dyer \"\"truth teller\"\"", "ReviewID": "R3IWMKS4FQBK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kodak 712Zis is a great camera. It's lightweight and easy to use.  As an owner of the Kodak DX7590 (still working great!) I upgraded to the 712Z for a few reasons:1.  the video is wonderful, although you cannot zoom during the video - you can make still pictures from the video, edit the video, and with the Kodak 2GB High Performance SD card I purchased the quality is wonderful.2.  In automatic mode this camera takes phenominal pictures in low lighting.3.  The LCD screen is large and easy to see.  I can see it outdoors (if I am not wearing sunglasses).  I wish I had not taken off the LCD protector because the screen DOES need constant wiping from fingerprint smudges.There are two not so great features - one is the cap IS cheap and does not stay well on the camera.  The other is the zoom - Although you have a 12x zoom, which is nice, while zooming you do not have a clear picture like you do with the DX7590, and it takes quite some time to get used to that feature.Overall, it's a great camera that takes great pictures.  With the price drop it's an incredible buy.Tip - The camera does NOT come with a recharable battery, so purchase the Kodak KLIC-8000 battery, and the Series 3 dock (which transfers pictures AND recharges your battery).", "Date": "August 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Everything I was hoping for!", "Author": "A. Winston", "ReviewID": "RZX1Y66FT2XQU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for a couple of weeks now.  At first, I was a bit overwhelmed by all the different settings that it offers.  But after spending some time playing with it and learning about it, I am so pleased with it.The zoom is incredible - I can see things through the zoom that I can't see with the naked eye off in the distance.  The image stabilizer really works well, especially out at the long zoom. I've taken several full zoom sharp/clear photos.  NICE!!It has a large LCD screen to view your photos or even set up the shoot.  Or you can use the view finder, which also has all the info on it.  That is very handy if you don't want to use the LCD screen.It's lightweight and easy to use... the controls are set up nice.  The video mode is wonderful - especially being able to zoom in and out WHILE shooting video.  That is a nice feature.  The colors are pure and the low light capabilities are fantastic.  I've taken a lot of photos inside, in very dim light, action shots, and more - a very wide range of photos.  I am very pleased with what I have gotten from this camera.  And it's fun to use too.It offers a large variety of picture modes - sports/action, portrait, backlight, and many more.  It also has a panaromaic mode which allows you to take 2-3 photos to make a panoramic shot.  The camera stitches those photos together (seamlessly) and it makes for a really great panoramic shot!!  It also offers ISO and several manual controls - PASM.  Flash options, macro, landscape, continuous shots, timer, etc.  This camera has it all.  There are also available lenses to go with it if you want even more!!The only negative I have found is the lens cap, I wish it was a bit more stable.  But it's not a big deal as it fits fine when the camera is turned off and that's when it's set down and could get the lens touched/scratched.  When on, the lens cap cannot be put on, but I don't want it on anyway.  :-)  I used the little lens strap to secure it to the camera so I didn't lose it.I've had really good luck with battery life.  The battery that came with it lasted about 4-5 days with VERY heavy shooting, zooming, and using the LCD screen.  I have a Klic-8000 rechargeable battery ordered but haven't received it yet.This is a GREAT camera choice with lots of options.  From fully automatic to lots of manual controls.  This super zoom can play ball right up there with the big boys and deliver stunning photos.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camer except for the Filter Ring and Batteries", "Author": "The Old Man \"from Utah\"", "ReviewID": "RWT1T8E6U1MR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is fantastic in all ways mentioned.  For the price, you can't beat it.There are, however, several things that Kodak doesn't tell you that are fairly severe limitations.1.No filter ring.  Kodak lists the ring as an Accessory Ring.  It is different from a filter ring.  I use a Polarizer regularly and wanted to mount one here.  In the Kodak world, it requires an Accessory Tube that costs about $20.  Only problem is that the tube causes major vignetting at low zoom (1X to 3X).2.There are many Wide Angle and Telephoto attachments available on Ebay.  Don't bother.  They don't really work.  A.The Wide Angle lens vignettes so that about half the frame is unusable.  If you zoom enough to eliminate the vignette, you loose the wide angle.  The picture is a nice circle that doesn't fill the frame.  B.The Telephoto lenses often advertise increasing your zoom by 2X, but it actually only adds about 2X to the zoom.  So the 12X zoom the Z712 becomes about a 14X.  Not worth the headache.3.Batteries - You can't use the Ni-MH AA batteries that I've used on older cameras.  They only deliver 1.2 volts per battery (2.4 volts total.)  The Z712 requires more voltage.  I only get about 40 pictures per charge on the Ni-MH batteries and that's not acceptable.  A.The only rechargeable battery the Z712 is compatible with is the Klic 8000 or the the Ricoh DB50.  The Klic 8000 costs around $18, plus $20 for the charger.  The Ricoh is available on Ebay for considerably less, but the mili-amp ratings are lower.  B.Radio Shack sells a CRV3 NiMH Rechargeable with 2.4 volts.  Don't use it as it's not compatible.  This thing requires 3 volts.4.Lithium Ion AA batteries are expensive.  As of today, you can find them for either $10 for four batteries, or $14 for eight batteries.  Expensive, but each pair of batteries gives about 200 pictures according to Kodak.  That means that the 8 Pack will deliver about 800 pictures for $14.  When comparing against buying the recharger and rechargeable batteries, purchasing the Lithium Ion batteries isn't that bad.I got around the filter attachment limitation by gluing a 49mm to 52 mm reduction ring onto the lens barrel with silicon caulk.  Tiny amount and extreme care to keep the caulk from the lens.  The reduction ring fits nicely inside the outer barrel and sat on the outer barrel while gluing.  Now, I have a filter ring for the Daylight and Polarizer filters that I use so often.So far, I love the camera.  High zoom, self installed filter capabilities, higher resolution, loads of features.  Even with the limitations, I give it four stars.  The battery issues I can live with, but not having a filter ring is just foolish.", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "A camera that takes great pictures with ease.", "Author": "Chris Martin", "ReviewID": "R1XK9HGACJO2I1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Z612 and the Z712 at the same time to compare them.  Overall they are very similar.  However the Z712 is the keeper for one reason - better pictures in low light.  The Z612 would start getting noisy at ISO 400.  The Z712 pictures are sharp at ISO 400.The Z712 is black and looks better than the silver Z612.  The black Z612 was very difficult to find.The Z712 uses the smart scene mode for auto mode where the camera tries to select the appropriate scene automatically (eg. beach, snow, etc).As always the Z712 is easy to use.I do have one main gripe with the Z712 and that is the LCD has been lowered to 115,000 pixels on the LCD versus 230,000 on the Z612.In the end, I returned the Z612 due to its low light capability.  The Z712 improves in this area.  It's not a Fuji in low light but it's the best I have seen from Kodak in the Z series.

I must have a dock because I need to recharge my batteries often.  So I ordered the dock through best buy cuz its not an easy dock to find.  I just got the dock today and the rechargeable battery it comes with IS NOT COMPATIBLE with the z712.  Hello...... The rechargeable battery is why I got the dock.  If there were no such things as rechargeable batteries then I would just plug the USB cable into my computer.

The CRV3 lasts pretty long (300+ with lots of reviewing), but isn't cheap.  I bought mine at a store and was mislead to believe that it would run with normal AAs or rechargeable NiMH AAs.  Nope!

Other cameras with similar features usually cost $100-200 more than the Z712. The features I liked best were the 12x optical zoom and optical image stabilization. It took sharp hand-held pictures (especially in low light with IS). The IS is also necessary for most handheld shots in high zoom.The image quality was very good. The main difference between this and the more expensive dSLR is the sensor sizes and interchangeable lenses. The z712 has a 1/2.5\" sensor, dSLR's start at about 15 times that area and up. This makes a huge difference in low-light and dynamic range of the pictures. But of course dSLR's are a lot bulkier and expensive. The Z712 has a lot of advanced features, I especially like the live histogram. Performance was overall quick, except when the buffer filled (about 5 burst pictures), then it takes almost 10 seconds to write it all into the memory card.The lens is fairly fast, meaning the aperture doesn't close down too much when fully zoomed (its widest setting is f/2.8 to f/4.8 at 12x zoom), so there's more available light even at highest zoom, so the shutter can be fast enough to freeze sports action, or ISO can remain low for low noise)The video mode (640x480 30fps) uses MPEG4 compression, which allows much longer clips due to its more efficient algorithm.This camera is smaller than it looks in pictures, my right hand (avg size) feels kind of cramped operating the shutter button and the mode dials and buttons with the thumb. The flip side is the camera is more portable than I had imagined, almost like a compact P&S; camera.The macro mode needs to get a lot closer, it can only get close to about 5 inches.Another thing is there's no manual white balance in the camera. This isn't a major concern, but for a prosumer camera, I would've expected this simple feature. But then again white balance can always be corrected in post-processing on a PC, but the extra step should be eliminated. Even though Kodak is known for their vivid print colors, they shouldn't be forcing the user to use the defaults, since users might occasionally want to balance their own whites and maybe even intentionally shoot with off-white colors for effects.One of the biggest problems with this camera is how much power it consumes. I tried AA alkalines just for fun and it took less than 20 (though there's still quite a bit of power left in the cells for other uses, the cutoff voltage seems high for triggering the low battery warning). I eventually ordered a charger & 2 Li-Ion CRV3 batteries (similar to Kodak's KLIC-8000) and they work as intended with probably around the CIPA rated number of pictures. I believe the documents state the camera was only inteded to use Lithium batteries, but if that's the case they should've made the battery a more proprietary type so people don't confuse with being able to use standard AA batteries that don't last long at all.Overall it's a great camera if you can overlook the issues I mentioned. Eventually I sold the Z712 online because the size was not portable enough for my personal tastes, and also the large zoom isn't as useful as I had thought for my type of shooting. I went with the Canon A720 IS for about the same street price with less zoom (6x), better battery life, slightly better image quality, & a more compact body.", "Date": "November 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "What good is an excellent dead camera?", "Author": "Willie V.

Outdoor pictures turned out very nice for the most part, but pictures not taken in natural lighting left much to be desired.  They were grainy, and just not as sharp as I would like.  My cyber shot took great photos even though it didn't have the telescoping lens and had a lower MP, I was expecting even better pictures but this kodak fell short.

This Kodak was the best of the lot, and when I looked at the Specifications and features, and I was sold.My experience with this machine has been very good.

Amazing: Those shots look as-if I were using tripod - no shake! no blur!Automation on the camera is good, biggest complaint I have is that the camera has no 1-button setting to compensate for back-lighting; my fix is to set one of the modes to overexpose by 2 stopsAs to batteries, yes camera will work with AA Alkalines and give you 50\u00b1 shots or more;it will *not* work with AA rechargeables, I've tried them - their voltage is too low!Non-rechargeable lithium batteries are good, but much too expensive for the use I put the camera to, I don't want to spend $7-$10 a week for batteries.Rechargeable Lithium batteries are THE way to go.  Several hundred photos per charge, rechargeable 100's of times (and going back to the AA batteries) - if you manage to run through the rechargeable batteries you can always buy a pair of AA alkalines most anywhere, and save the day!Overall this camera has been an excellent buy.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Z712 IS is a Good Camera!", "Author": "GNM109", "ReviewID": "R25JLDDSQVJPRX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm pleasantly surprised with my new Kodak Z712 IS.

The panorama feature is a great addition as are the numerous other modes available.I also have an older Kodak DC 240 that is still working well after five years and the Z712 IS has the same feeling of solid reliabiity.The only negative issuues are the lack of a bundled SD card and rechargeable battery and charger. These must be bought extra for an additional $60 or so. That's more of a marketing problem than anything negative about the camera, however.Best of all, the total price was less than the estimate to repair the non-working flash on my Nikon 990 which is now DOA.I recomment the Kodak Z712 IS to anyone who likes quiet, touble-free photography at a reasonable price.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "N.

For the most part, I think it's a terrific product... much better than my other Kodak (DX6440)which, after more than four years, still takes great pictures.

It does a couple of things that annoy me, e.g., switching back to Auto Flash every time it powers up.  If I'm not paying attention, this will cause the flash to pop open when I press the shutter release button the first time.  But, in the overall scheme of things, this is a nit.With considerable interest, I read all of the two-star and one-star reviews of this camera.  Again and again, people complained about its ravenous appetite for batteries.  Several reviewers indicated they could only get twenty pictures.  I have to presume they were using AA alkaline batteries... in spite of the camera's docs clearly recommending only the lithium variety.  I also bought the camera dock and rechargeable li-ion battery. After charging the battery completely, I conducted an experiment.  I switched the auto flash ON and the LCD display OFF.  For several reasons, I prefer to use the EVF.  At any rate, I started taking flash pictures and continued taking them until the battery was so exhausted, the poor thing couldn't even keep the camera turned on for more than a couple of seconds.

In light of all the alarming \"battery eater\" reviews, I was both surprised and delighted.All in all, this is a great product... particularly in light of its very attractive price.

Anyway, I have taken very good shots from my kids and places around the world (it does travel well), and even though it is a bulky camera, it is not so hard to place in my purse (granted, I do use large purses).I am a mom of three tots who has her camera around the kitchen ready to put those amazing moments in digital form -to then share them on facebook or instagram.

I did not realize until a year later (don't ask) that I had to buy the Li-Ion rechargeable battery in order to get the most out of battery life. Well, it did pay off.  The battery lasts for weeks if unused and I have taken up to 200 pictures in a day without even wasting half of the battery. Bliss!!Unfortunately, and this is why the 4 stars, after my kids grew up and they started moving around, the camera did not keep up.

I really loved my old Z712 that I had used most of the time for the past couple of years, although I have other more expensive & complex cameras. I really loved the sports mode & burst feature for capturing moments at my grandson's soccer & football games, and because it was fairly small & easy to use, it was my main choice when traveling or taking family pictures. With that 12X zoom, I've taken so many really great pictures & was very upset when that camera was destroyed. I was delighted to find that I could get a refurbished Z712 on Amazon, since all the newer models I checked out were either too expensive, had no burst feature, had only an LED screen & no viewfinder, or lacked some other important feature my old Z712 had. The camera arrived only 4 days after I ordered it, but because the Z712 was out-of-stock, the dealer substituted a Kodak Z812 IS 8.1MP Digital Camera. So far, it's pretty similar to my old Z712, except for a couple of changes they could've done without. The sports mode is no longer on the dial on top of the camera, but is one of the SCN menu choices, which is just not as convenient, since I switched to that mode a lot at sporting events and when taking pictures of active children! Also, the click-on lens cap that pops off each time the camera is turned on takes some getting used to, since the Z712 had just a push-on cap that I took off manually when using the camera. Because I received it at the end of my grandson's sport season, I haven't had much of a chance to use the burst feature & sports mode, but did take some really great pictures outside on Halloween as the kids were trick-or-treating, and have taken some very nice indoor closeup shots.  They all seem to be as sharp and clear as the ones I used to take with my Z712. I print out all my pictures, rather than storing them on the computer, and my old Z712 and the new Z812 both produce excellent clarity & detail, even when printing the occasional 5X7 or 8X10. As for battery life, I'm hoping that using Energizer 8X Lithium batteries like I used in my Z712 will get the same good results in my Z812. I take LOTS of pictures, and with my Z712, I usually got several hundred pictures, many with flash, on one pair of batteries. I'm also hoping that the refurbished Z812 will keep working the way my Z712 did (although that one was purchased new a couple of years ago). I never had ANY problems with the Z712, and am hoping the Z812 will be as good quality as the Z712 was for years to come.

I was wanting something more then a pocket camera, but not as fancy as an SLR...this is the PERFECT in-between!The main reason I love this camera so much is the click-to-capture speed. When I hit the button, I expect the camera to take the picture that second, not 2 seconds later (the C-class did this, which was VERY annoying at Nascar races or football games). Also, the 12 zoom has been very convenient to have on family vacations. I have a young son, and this camera has been awesome at capturing his day-to-day activities. I use the Energizer CRV3 Lithium Photo batteries for it, and they last a LONG time, usually a few months per battery!It's a nice size, but some may find it a bit cumbersome at first, especially if your used to little pocket size cameras.

It can be had as low as $140 depending on the sellers that come across here on Amazon, which is amazing. The 712IS's auto mode has a pretty accurate focus, and it is quite snappy (fast) at doing so. The auto mode is probably what the vast majority of consumers will use on Z712IS, and I can say that the auto mode works quite well.Additionally, if you're that budding photo hobbyist (like me) who isn't quite ready to jump to DSLR, this camera is for you. On top of the image stabilized 12X zoom, the Z712IS has Aperture, Shutter and Full Manual modes - plus a nifty jog dial to navigate through these settings. You can take some dazzling photos if you fully understand this camera's features.Keep in mind though, these settings can in no way replace the flexibility of a DSLR. To me, it's more like getting a taste of how a DSLR may or may not function.Pros:-12X Zoom, Image Stabilizer-Manual Modes-Very quick and snappy-Electronic Viewfinder, perfect for sunny days when you can't see the LCD-\"Perfect Touch\" option improves a lot of dark photos-Solid & well constructed for the most part.-Cheap!!!Cons:-Lens MUST be exposed if you turn it on... even just to review pics!-Door for the SD memory cards is a bit flimsy-Battery life is sub par. But please note that this camera only operates correctly on lithium batteries! It even says so on the battery door. For those of you rating this camera low because you're using NiMH batteries, try reading the instructions! Personally, I bought 3rd party rechargeable batteries right here on Amazon, and they work great.-A minor con, but the lens cap must be laced through the neck strap.All in all, this camera is worth it if you can find it cheap (below 200), which isn't difficult.

The features I was most interested in -- image stabilization, optical zoom, and megapixels -- were better than any other camera I reviewed for the same price range.  Digital zoom of twelve was more than twice the zoom I could get from any other camera in the same price range.  The megapixels are high enough to print a poster, which you won't need very often.  The best thing about the megapixel setting was that it is flexible to 3, 5, or 7; meaning that you can get more pictures on your memory card.  I set mine at 5 megapixels because I usually print 3X5 pictures and use my pictures as screen savers.  Image stabilization really comes in handy when you take pictures quickly, or when you are in museum mode.  Also the battery is strong enough so that there is no delay between the time you press the buttom to take the picture and the camera responding.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Danny", "ReviewID": "R31N1Y8XYT2G6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera it takes really nice pictures for the price you pay compared to other cameras with the same optical zoom and MP this is a great bargain.

It was a decent camera when it worked, but just over two years now since purchased,  out of warranty,  it barely works.  A problem in the power switch makes it fail to turn on, or sometimes turn on but turn off unexpectedly.  After researching online, including here, it looks like I'm not the only one who has seen this, and that Kodak customer service is said to be very poor.  Various posts claim they don't have parts available to repair it.  They don't make parts available to local camera repair shops, so you can't have someone you know work on it. I would have to send it to their authorized repair center. They want $150 just to look at repairing it. For that, I'll buy a reliable point & shoot, and maybe get a reliable DSLR later on as well, but not another Kodak.  Sure, I am re-posting some heresay that I have gathered from around the web, which maybe is not fair.  But reading those comments does not make me want to start the process of trying to get some credit out of a faceless corporation.  I don't have spare time for that.

I wish I had done some more personal testing of other cameras before my purchase. Yes, it takes a good picture, but there are several things not to like about this camera.1.  It uses AA batteries (may be a plus to some people) but if you take a lot of pictures, the batteries will constantly be dying.  And if you buy rechargable batteries, the batteries start to die by the 3rd picture.2.  It takes several seconds to resume the ability to shoot after each picture, not good if you have kids sitting in poses.3.  It is gigantic - bigger is definitely not better in this instance.  For a professional camera that might be acceptable, but when one half its size is just as good, there is no reason to buy such a monster of a camera.4.  Every time you change the batteries, you need to reprogram the date and time.  Again, if you are trying to catch your kids doing something cute, this is sooooo annoying.5.  The \"on/off\" button malfunctioned after about 2 months and I had to send it in to be fixed.
