The first one is still great and 4 years old but I wanted the extra features in the TG-610.  The in camera panorama feature is so easy to use as are all the other features. Instant video button is a big improvement.  I have been using it for a month now and have no faults with this camera.  We travel a lot and a tough camera is a must. The monitor has a very clear sharp image even in bright sunlight which has always been a problem with point and shoot camera's.  I would highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Versatile and tough", "Author": "James Charanis \"JimmyC\"", "ReviewID": "RC0BEI5D244BG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great outdoor pictures and Video, good indoor shots, easy to use, though fat fingers may struggle a bit..Lives up to it's promise of waterproof and tough. Bought from Best Buy as they are the only ones that had it in stock.  We had an earlier model and were updating for the HDVideo. I will be taking this on a 14 day backpacking hike, will let you know. Video is pretty good and pictures are also pretty good. These cameras do not expose well with flash and this one suffers the same fate, for close up flash shots you will want to compensate by setting exposure down 1 or 2 clicks but other than that the shots are good. And sometimes focus/ready will be delayed, I've missed shots because of that.  I'm sure as I get to use the presets it will get better. Looking forward to the GPS on my treck. It works and this is great for iPhoto and tracking locations..  It also is a little heavy but that is what it's about, this is a tough camera and you can feel confident taking it anywhere.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tough as the name says!", "Author": "Good times to be had", "ReviewID": "RZHZCV65VSBZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I wanted a camera that could go with me where ever I went. Last year I purchased one of the waterproof cameras from Fugifilm (finepix xp10) and was not impressed, it felt cheap and ended up leaking water behind the screen after 2 uses. I returned it after that and went without a waterproof digital for the rest of the summer. This year I decided to spend a little more money hoping to get a lot more camera. I wanted pictures at the lake, on the river, in the pool and I didn't want to have to worry about my camera getting ruined while I was having fun. So far I'd say The Olympus TG-610 I picked is perfect camera for my needs. Right out of the box I could tell this camera was far superior to the fuji. This olympus is metal, the buttons feel much nicer, the screen is bigger and more clear, it just has a nice look and feel to it.So far I've had it in and out of the water on multiple occasions without any problems, haven't tried snorkeling but it works great in the river or swimming pool. In bright light the picture quality is impressive, especially after reading poor reviews of other 'tough' cameras and the less than satisfactory performance of the fuji. I think this one takes good pictures, not professional quality, but plenty good to enjoy and share. Even in low light at concerts we have had good luck getting crisp images. The video feature is nice, easy to use and so far respectable results.The only things I wish were better about this camera are the flash, start-up time is slow and there is a long lag between pictures. The flash always leaves a shadow behind your subject, it doesn't have the double flash that a lot of point and shoot cameras have today. Then there is the start up time. It seems like it takes forever for this camera to turn on and be ready to fire, then once you do get your first picture taken, it again takes a long time before you can get another one. There are a couple of different burst shooting modes available but if you are just in regular shooting mode it takes a good 3 to 4 seconds between pictures, with significant shutter lag.That all being said, I bought this camera for outdoor adventure use and so far it has done everything I've asked of it, and I've gotten a lot of pictures, great pictures I could not have gotten without the waterproof feature of this camera. . . this is a must buy for the adventurer or summer outdoor enthusiast!", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Won't focus.  Very disappointed", "Author": "P. Hanlin", "ReviewID": "R10YBKE87WB76M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very hopeful that this would be a great waterproof point-and-shoot.  I am an experienced photographer and own a range of cameras from simple P&S; all the way up to full frame DSLRs but needed something for a pool, beach, and snorkeling vacation. While this camera worked well on occasion, its inability to focus on range of circumstances made for a host of ruined shots and missed opportunities. I normally shoot in the \"spot\" mode so I can choose what to focus on and when recompose the shot.  About 80% of the time, it was unable to focus, whether in bright light, low light, high contrast, or low contrast.  Overall:Pros - simple and intuitive to use, good waterproofing, bright LCD displayCons - terrible focus, short battery life, sensitive joystick (often went \"down\" instead of \"select\" when pressed - required a light touch)I'm returning mine for refund rather than replacement, so I won't be able to tell if this particular camera is defective or it is a broader problem.  I'm hoping for Olympus' sake that I just got a bad one.  I can't imagine people being satisfied with it.  I'll likely try Canon's waterproof P&S; instead.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "This camera's a toughy, but has great features aswell", "Author": "JULIE BROWN", "ReviewID": "R2ADBWX4JN4J3O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera and would recomend it to anybody, even if you do not need a tough camera.I think that even if you do not want a tough camera I think that it is still good to have one. The reason is because now compact digital cameras are very easy to break, unlike some cameras because they sometimes get made out of plastic, and other things like that to be light... I have also heard of many people breaking their digital compact camera and sometimes not even high drops.Not only can this camera can detect faces, it can detect dogs and even cats! This feature works well however not aswell as I would like it to.GPS positioning works also great on this camera, so does the barometer and the altitude/water depth information.Some people look at this camera and think that it is not very powerful zoom however I think it is good and if I really need to, the digital zoom is good enough.The built in panorama works good. What happens is you put the camera on the panorama mode and you take the first photo, then you can move the camera left, right, up or down to take the second photo and then the third. The camera can join three photos in one panorama, however if you set it on the PC mode it can do up to ten photos.Over-all those are MY favourite features of this camera.

As to the qualities related to its primary purpose, taking pictures and video clips, they are about average for this class of photo equipment.My major complaint is the much-advertised (and potentially very useful for the target customer base) GPS function, which adds extra $100 to the retail price (compared to the GPS-less TG-610) but almost never works. It takes the built-in GPS up to 20 minutes to get a position fix even under most favorable conditions where my wrist watch with a built-in GPS would do it almost instantly. Under less favorable conditions (around tall buildings or under tree cover), the camera GPS gets totally lost.

I was a little nervous by some of the reviews for everyday pictures, but this one seemed to be the best for the buck. I couldn't be happier! First thing I did was play (of course) with all of the fun features to get to know what to use for what situations. I was not only blown away by the number of options for optimal photo quality, but most definitely by the quality of photos that came with all of the options. I stuck the camera in my saltwater aquarium and came up with an amazing picture of my anemones, changed the settings and took perfectly clear pictures of my dog and cats. (also recommend checking out the automatic pet sensor option!) Flipped it to night, and took an awesome shot of my backyard. I have played with it in daylight, night, lowlight, 3D, and have been impressed at every turn. One suggestion that may seem obvious but escaped me for a minute is to make sure to wipe the lens off after you have it in water. Water spots really have an affect on the picture quality.

It was a no brainer when the time came to replace it: I would get the 'new and improved' model of the same great camera!Well, not so improved. The few pics I did get initially are gorgeous...but I did notice upon opening the camera the first time and preparing for charging, that the battery door was tricky. Difficult to open, more difficult to close completely. (the previous model was simple and easy to open and close securely.) I was displeased that to charge the camera you have to place the charger cord into the battery door and insert it directly into the camera, rather than take the battery out and put it into an external charger as the older model did. (my point being that I didn't like leaving the battery door open for hours while the camera charged).  On the fateful day, only 3 weeks after receiving this camera, I had been taking pictures at a party, and everything was performing well. My daughter asked to take it into the pool to take pics with her brother and friends, and immediately brought it back to me in tears. \"Mom, I went underwater and it died!\" I had been standing there watching, and believe me, she had not been playing with or messing with the battery door. Indeed, water had gotten into the battery door that appeared to be closed properly.  Olympus, please go back to the old battery charging method and door closing mechanism...too bad you messed with a good thing!", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unreliable", "Author": "Anna", "ReviewID": "RGMZ6TUGON4IQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in May of 2011 to use on my honeymoon. I used it a handful of times during that trip and it took decent pictures. This June (2012), I pulled it out to charge it for another trip we were taking, and it won't charge! The lens keeps clicking open and shut and the back screen flickers on and off. We followed all the directions for how to maintain it (rinsing and so forth) and treated it well, so there's no reason why it should suddenly not charge. So disappointing! A Google search of the problem revealed that others have had the same problem.I emailed customer service about it (twice) and never heard back. A month later I called customer service and was told I could send it in for repair for $108. After using it maybe 5 times and for only 2 weeks?

I was happy with the 1030 SW but the TG-810 offered GPS, HD video, a longer zoom, and higher resolution.  Sadly, the only improvement was the longer zoom, everything else was a step backward.The old 1030 SW preformed very well on a trip to the Bolivian Amazon jungle last year. It maintained its waterproofness, took adequate photos and the battery lasted for an entire day of shooting. The TG-810, on the other hand, when taken on the same trip a year later, took very grainy photos in comparison. The lens fogged up constantly, despite its supposed better door seals. The GPS was next to useless with a total of thirty out of 800 photos actually getting geotagged! Those that were successfully tagged had poor accuracy. Luckily I had a small thumb-drive sized GPS data logger from Canmore  that worked flawlessly, fixing position in seconds from a cold start. The Olympus 810 took 5 MINUTES, or more, if it ever acquired a position! There is definitely something wrong with the GPS on this camera, just read all of the disclaimers on the FAQ page on Olympus website for this camera. The battery lasted for only a part of a day's shooting, luckily I was carrying three spare batteries and used them all each day! The startup time is abysmal as well. My 810 takes over 5 seconds before it can take its first picture. It may be a tough camera, but it is a poor one. While the video is better than the 1030's, the focus is constantly searching, jumping in and out of focus. The joy-stick is erratic at best, requiring that you double check every adjustment you make.If I could return this camera, I would.Poor picture quality, poor GPS performance, poor battery life, and very slow, are just a few issues.I have two other Olympus cameras that I am relatively happy with.

We needed a waterproof camera for all of these activities and have been using one with a waterproof casing for years.  We decided to switch to one that is waterproof on its own.  Bought this one for all of the incredible reviews (on this and other websites) about it's durability.  I REALLY wanted to like this camera!It is durable, yes.  However, we took it to the park to take a few shots of the kids and the dog and just get a feel for the camera in general.  When we got the pictures onto our computer to take a look, they were incredibly grainy.  Even the still shots came out pretty blurry --and this was in the sunshine where almost any camera should put out clean shots.  The ones in our living room were even worse.  I truly feel like pictures I take with my iPhone come out better than these did.Like I said, I really did want to like this camera.  If you only care about getting the image captured by a very durable camera and don't care as much about the quality of the photos, you then this may be the camera for you.

However, once I was down south, it was a total disappointment. The daylight pictures were ok but the colors and contrast were lacking compared to my other Canon, Panasonic and Sony cameras.  The low light pictures were poor and the underwater pictures were similar my friend's $99 Kodak Playsport ZX3, which was more than half the price. The worst things about this camera were the slow startup time which caused me to miss many fish shots, the poor battery life, the awkward menu system, and the small joystick which was very difficult to use both on land and especially when you're underwater. It was so small that often the wrong buttons were pressed and would change settings so that you would have to go back and change them back. Even the floating strap was disappointing since it was too big to fit on the wrist and had to be used on the forearm which took longer to get it into your hand on short notice.Also didn't like how you have to leave the battery door open to charge the battery which makes it suspectible to damage. Glad I was able to return it and go back to the more superior Canon, Panasonic and Sony products.  The Sony X-10 has the best lowlight capabilities, is the smallest and thinnest, and takes the best looking underwater pics and goes to 16ft, even compared to the Olympus 810 and Panasonic FT4. But its lcd touchscreen doesn't allow menu changes underwater, which I often do. The Panasonic FT-4 is tougher, goes deeper to 33ft, and takes good overall pics but at lower depths the lcd screen shows weaknesses. The Kodak is the simplest to use, is the cheapest, has a fast startup time, and takes decent underwater pics and videos to 10ft but has lower resolution and picture quality.

The camera takes pretty good pictures for a point and shoot.  There are a few shortcomings however that keep this camera from getting five stars. The navigation button on the back of the camera is difficult to use at times because it is too easy to select the wrong direction accidentally. The video quality also wasn't that great. The camera seemed to have trouble focusing and would go in and out way too often. I would not rely on this camera for your video needs. There also seems to be a bit of a quality control issue.

This is one solid camera with nothing cheap about any part - it almost has a military quality feel.  The 3\" LCD display is outstanding and while the controls are a little small and closely spaced the camera is easy to use.  I think Olympus made a reasonable trade-off between providing a largest display possible and the slightly crowed controls.  Overall this camera is a great compromise between features, ease of use and a super rugged design.Some of the negatives mentioned in other reviews are valid.  The location of the lens does allow for a finger to block the picture and the GPS is slow to connect.  I also think that Olympus should have included a charger not just a power supply with the camera - having to open the battery door to charge the camera seems silly for a otherwise excellent design.I also own a Cannon D10 which is a great camera.  The two big negatives of the D10 are that you can't easily slip it into pocket and it doesn't have an integrated GPS - I think the TG-810 will be a great replacement for the D10.Update - True Story - Feb 2012We are on Vacation in Roatan (Island off of Honduras) and had been using this camera for a few days when it disappeared.  We had used in on land and snorkeling with nice results but the other day it went missing.  After a day or so of turning the rented condo upside down there was no trace - until my wife did the laundry.  We came back from the beach and the washer was stuck in the spin cycle - no joke - and after we stopped the washer and opened the washing machine there was the camera mixed in with the clothing.  It had been spinning for hours.It still works no problems - it's now very clean as well.  I took the SD card out and loaded the pictures on my computer - again no problems.  Wow, this is a rugged camera.We also have our Canon D10 on this trip and I like the pictures from the Olympus better than the Canon - both in and out of the water - although both are good.  I do however like the controls on the Canon better than the Olympus.  Also, the strap on the Canon is better as is has the sliding lock so the camera won't fall off your wrist while swimming - a little thing I agree but it shows an attention to detail.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great!!!", "Author": "Spencer O.

The first thing that struck me was \"Olympus brand, 14MP, Underwater capability, GPS and all for just USD 199....\", On a closer look I noticed that its super solid build can withstand falls up to nearly 7 feet and the camera body has a crush resistance of 220 lbs. Another plus for me is that its software is compatible with MAC (most camera manufacturer only provide software with Windows compatibility).Having used the camera for a few days I must say that I am pleased with its performance and quality. Its drawback is that you need a learning process (oh, and have a magnifying glass handy to read the instruction manual..). The joystick needs \"fine tuning\" to obtain the desired option. The camera has some other drawbacks, like \"delayed picture shot\" (you need to lock in on the focus beforehand before pressing the shutter through in order not to have virtually seconds in delays on executing your shot). So on faster moving objects you are bound to miss your desired shot... Another drawback is its high battery drainage as the camera can accidentally be turned on by pressure (playback button/compass etc.) and its GPS can drain the battery in no time.... these are not good news... and Olympus should have at least build-in a lock system for the \"power-off\" and/or provide a feature to de-activate the camera high power draining features. They (Olympus) seem to simply have forgotten about this or had no remedy/space to incorporate such feature/s technically... a real bummer... and forget about a second battery. You will need to charge it inside the camera battery compartment...Having said all this, lets look at its positive side and which in my personal opinion make this camera the equivalent of a solid 4x4 SUV....- Solid Build throughout with automated lens cover- Water Resistance up to 33 feet- 14 MP good flash and quality pictures (best in sunlight and/or good light conditions)- lots of additional picture modes and MAC compatibility on software- acceptable Video quality with zoom capability (no noise)- many other features such as compass, GPS, nanometer etc.For the \"good and all its technical features at a price of $199\" I would give this model a 5 Star, eyes closed......, but its \"high battery drainage\", \"complicated handling\" along with not being full HD and at times a bit \"nervous on sharp/unsharp focusing movements during video shoot) take away 4 stars in my opinion..... Then again, you can not have it all, a water resistance to 33 feet and all its super features and expect easy buttons for operations, more manual features, good battery performance etc..... or can you? At a price of USD 199 the camera its worth it but I would not pay a dime more. Its like wanting to have a 4x4 SUV at a discount with the consumption expectancy of a Toyota Prius and the speed of a Ferrari... , but then again thinking about it, this is not a car.. A power reduction feature in my opinion is a must as you may miss many Pictures and/or Videos due battery drainage.

After three days, the motor stopped working.

It is a defect with the camera.Stay away from this Olympus camera.  Get a Sony or Nikon.If you have one, I wish you the best of luck.

Henry \"atlantagreg\"", "ReviewID": "R26M1R7LKQE3MH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my third \"Tough\" model camera.  The first one died after someone drove a truck over it (no, they don't stand up to trucks, in icy conditions), and I gave my second one away to a family member who lives in a wetter climate (it's still working for them).  The 610 was my replacement for that.  I'll simply list my Pros and Cons with a summary below:PROS:1)  Solid build construction compared to competition.  Doesn't feel cheap.2)  Decent set of features for the price (zoom, panorama feature, waterproof, etc).3)  Clear, sharp LCD screen.4)  Uses SD memory cards (Olympus dumped the XD picture cards from previous models !5)  Stands up to humid/dirty/dusty/sandy conditions.CONS:1)  Water proofing is iffy at best - resists rain great, going underwater is hit and miss.  Not trustworthy enough for scuba diving, in my opinion.2)  3D mode is a gimmick - too hard to get realistic 3D effects; you need a dedicated two-lens 3D camera for that.3)  Image quality is only average - compression artifacts, noise, and blown highlights are more common than they should be.4)  Movie quality is also only average and focusing sometimes goes \"in and out\" of focus while filming.5)  Poor battery life, and in-camera charging is inconvenient.  Pick up a spare and keep it charged just in case.6)  Fiddly placement of memory card slot - hard to get card out if you have larger fingers.SUMMARY:There are worse cameras on the market, and worse \"weather proof\" cameras on the market as well.  The Olympus 610 is middle of the road, as it doesn't stand out as a great camera but isn't bad overall.  If you know a bit about taking photos and processing them in a program later like Photoshop Elements, you can make the shots look much better than they are out of the camera - good enough for very good 4x6 and 5x7 prints, and acceptable 8x10 prints from normal viewing distances.  If you use photos as they are out of the camera, or you pixel-peep images at 100% size on your computer screen, you may be a bit disappointed.  Likewise, while the movie mode is ok for very quick and casual clips at a party or get together, I wouldn't count on the focusing for things like a wedding, baby's first steps, etc.I'm leery of the waterproof claims of this generation from Olympus.  I dropped this camera in a friend's pool (2 ft area) and immediately pulled it out.  When I opened the battery compartment later there was a single drop of water inside that had seeped in during that brief exposure to the water - so I can believe the claims made by others on here about the inconsistent reliability when using this underwater to take photos.  My opinion:  It's a great camera to use in humid, sandy, dusty, or dirty conditions, in the rain, etc.  Great for construction sites, for example.  But if I really wanted to take actual underwater photos, I think I'd feel more comfortable using a camera with a dedicated waterproof housing around it, rather than any of these cameras.This camera on sale is around $149 or so, and for that price it's great for the more extreme conditions I mention above.  If you're just looking for a camera that takes excellent quality photos, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a dedicated underwater-use camera, I'd look elsewhere, too.

Where to start.... As usual, Olympus throws in all these \"features\" so that you don't really want, which just makes it harder to take a point-and-shoot, which is frankly all this little job is built for.Here's the worst one though: The camera comes with a little memory built-in. Then you can buy a card to stick in later, right? So you go out, take thousands and thousands of photos, hook it up to your computer, and transfer. Right? And then you wipe the card, to start over again, right? Well guess what you just did? You just erased ALL your photos and you didn't transfer any of them!How is this possible you ask? Easy.

The Tough 610 is the 3rd Olympus Stylus \"tough\" I've owned.  I started with a 720 SW, moved on to a 6020 and now own a 610.  The 610 is the best of the lot.First, the turn on time has been brought back to around a second, about the same time as the 720 SW.  This is important because I shoot a lot of wild life on the ocean, from a kayak. I can better afford to keep the camera off, conserving battery life and with the lens cover closed, keeping water off the lens. The 6020 took several seconds, which often seemed like an eternity with a whale or a dolphin leaping in front of me.Second, the camera now remembers the last mode setting.  This saves me time when I power up the camera.  In the 2 earlier versions the camera always came up in program mode, which I'm sure the designers thought gave the user the best possibility for a good shot at start up. Since I'm primarily shooting wild life which is not going to hold still, I find it better to shoot in sports mode.  Many times I got a blurry shot with the 2 earlier models because I had to shoot right after power up and the camera took it's time working through the program as my boat rocked and rolled.  Or I'd be delayed resetting to sports mode, one handed, while my subject flew or swam away.Major draw backs continue to be short battery life (compensated somewhat by faster turn on) and feeble flash.  The 2 prior Tough's were fair on cloudy days.  I'll have to reserve judgement on the 610's performance in low natural light, it's been sunny since I got it.BTW I did not get the 810 because the GPS feature undoubtedly shortens on time and other reviews stated it took the 810 a long time to generate a position from start up so turning the camera off to conserve power would defeat the GPS.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good not great", "Author": "J.

I lost it on a canoeing trip, and for all I know it might still be working at the bottom of that river :P This is the 3rd generation of their tough cameras, and it has the obligatory improvements in megapixels, and toughness. But is it better?First, the picture quality is a bit better, so that's a win, because the original version did leave a little to be desired. And it has some nice features I was excited about, namely GPS. But this feature in particular is troubled.GPS absolutely destroys the battery life. Which is to be expected to some extent. But in order for GPS tagging to work properly you need to leave the camera on long enough for it to get a fix. This is very much at odds with the mediocre battery life. If you turn the camera on, snap a few pictures, and turn it off, none of them will be geotagged. It's bad enough that this is almost a non-feature for me, and I've ended up just turning it off.I've certainly put the extra durability to the test. I take it sailing in salt water. Hiking with drops from chest height (I'm 6' 5\") onto rocky terrain. Winter camping where it gets caked in ice, and sits in sub zero temperatures all night, and just required a minute or two under my coat to warm up enough to work. Needless to say, I'm impressed. It certainly lives up to it's tough moniker. THIS is why you buy this particular camera.But here is the biggest problem for me. Somewhere between the first generation, and this one, the start-up time became abysmal. From the moment you hit the power button, till the moment you can take a picture seems like an eternity. I've missed many good pictures because of it, and frustrated many people who I hand the camera to. It's long enough that they begin to question if something is wrong. And because of the battery life, you can't just leave the camera on to be prepared. You'd run out of battery real fast. There doesn't seem to be any sort of \"sleep mode\" either. The Camera is either on or off.All that being said. I still like this camera. It's by FAR the toughest camera out there, and the image quality is quite good now. If a future versions continued improvements in ISO (no more megapixels please), start-up times, and battery life, I'll definitely stick with this line of cameras.P.S. If you do buy the camera, and intend to be out for more than a day, buy another battery.

We were going to Hanauma Bay, a marine nature preserve. I wanted to capture what turned out to be one of my most memorable vacations ever.The camera came with only a quick start guide, so my photos were taken on the fly. I was unaware of the depth of the settings available, thus all of my photos were taken in the auto setting. When I loaded the photos to my computer, at first glance, they were mediocre at best. However, with iPhoto's enhance feature, I was thrilled with the crisp and colorful photos of my underwater adventure. This is where my positive review ends.This camera is rated to be waterproof to 33 feet. Now, in my opinion a camera that is rated to that depth is going to be used in bodies of water that have sand. This is not a \"pool only\" use camera. After using the camera in the ocean on a particularly rough tide day (lots of sand floating around), I found that I was unable to use the zoom toggle button and the shutter button became stuck in the focus position. Additionally, the menu controls collected some smaller particles of sand as well. None of the issues were resolved by rinsing the camera. I had to use a toothpick and toothbrush to remove the sand from the zoom toggle button and I never was able to completely clear the shutter release button. I would have to depress it repeatedly in order to get it to operate properly for one shot, then repeatedly depress the button.I checked the Olympus web site to see if there were any \"skins\" available to cover the the camera. I found camera cases at the minimum price of $200. In my opinion I should not have to spend nearly $400 on a camera that has a depth rating of 33 feet and the toughness rating that this camera has, then have to spend an additional $200 for a case to protect the camera from sand collection.I did start to research other waterproof cameras and was shown  a TG 310 that appeared to have some sort of flexible covering over most of the controls, a feature that I was shocked that was not included on the other Tough models.In a nutshell, I returned the camera.

This will also come in handy if grand-kids ever come along for sunny (or rainy) days at the beach or pool as well as the shock proof feature.

I borrowed it to take to an event where I was working yesterday, as I didn't want to lug around my DSLR. What an awful camera this thing is. I won't make that mistake again.First, it takes to long to focus. Even turning it on seems to take an eternity. I have no idea what those silly icons are that appear in the middle of the display when you first turn it on, I did read the manual months ago but I can't remember them now. Now, they just get in the way. I missed a lot of shots because the focusing took so long, and there was a noticeable annoying delay from when the shutter was pressed, to when the photo was actually taken. This was how digital cameras worked 10-15 years ago, there's no excuse for this now. My wife complained that almost all of her photos were very blurry, but then I showed her how she needed to wait for the blue box to appear, then she asked \"why does it take so long?\".The powersave feature is very irritating as well. The camera goes to sleep too soon, then getting it to \"wake up\" takes too long.It also seems to have a mind of it's own. It would randomly change modes, turn the flash on (when I really needed it to stay OFF), some photos have the date in the corner, some don't. The little \"joystick\" thingy is really irritating, too easy to bump, had to get precise control, etc.Ten years ago, this may have been a great camera. Now, there are much better choices.

The 8000 model made it through just two years, and only 15 actual days of being used underwater. These cameras are still designed the same way with gaskets throughout that will over time fail. Not saying these cameras will begin taking on water immediately, but you will eventually experience this problem. It is inevitable. It all comes down to how long these cameras spend time in the water. They are just not made decently enough to spend up to 6 or 8 hours in the water at a single time. Bottom line is, the more time you use these cameras underwater, the quicker it will be destroyed, and these cameras are not cheap. Those that have written good or decent reviews on this camera or any of these Tough series cameras, still have one that works so yes, it is a good camera, until it breaks.
