The wide angle lens really comes in handy; the main reason that I choose this camera.

It lets you fit more into a shot.Pictures taken indoors are surprisingly inferior. I know the product description mentions picture stabalization, but I didn't see any sign of it. What I did see was that it's almost impossible to take a good picture indoors in regular indoor lighting conditions. I'm not talking about a few candles, but really normal indoor lighting with a bit of indirect sunlight and a lamp switched on. Without the flash, images come out blurry; and with the flash, items in the foreground are too bright while the background is too dark. This for me was a huge disappointment.I have no complaints, however, about the pictures this camera takes outdoors. They are stunning, rivaling the ones I used to take with my old SLR, pictures I used to sell to newspapers. They're crisp, and their colors are sharp. This is a great camera for outdoor shots.The large viewing screen is very nice and makes it easy to see what your picture will look like before you snap it.The buttons are a bit difficult to figure out, not the worst I've seen, but also far from the best. I don't know why, but I also keep finding my camera has switched itself back to automatic settings after I've changed them to turn the flash off. If I could, I would reset the settings so the flash only turned on when I wanted to use it. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be an option.All in all, this is a good camera for the price, with a few drawbacks.There's one more thing I would like to mention: I highly recommend getting the 2GB Olympus XD card with this camera. It's expensive, but it holds 1,000 high quality 8MP pictures. The carrying case is nice and cushiony, but it's really tiny, basically a camera version of a cloth eye-glasses case. You can do without that, but you can't do without the XD card. The camera can't hold more than ten or so pictures without it.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Olympus Camera", "Author": "P.

The battery life is remarkable, and the battery lasts for approximately 2 days (with moderate usage of taking and then showing images to all involved).The only downside -- It is nearly impossible to take a decent picture with this camera (without a tripod) in poor lighting conditions.  The stabilization feature does NOT help with this problem.", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera, average software", "Author": "Redjr", "ReviewID": "R2GBHGVW8UN9E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Olympus FE-350 because I needed a wider lense than the typical point-and-shoot camera. I was not disappointed. The FE-350 is easy to use and provides great pictures.I gave the camera a rating of four stars because I need to be able to create panoramas and the Olympus Master software provided with the camera doesn't do that great of a job stitching photos together. I have been getting better results from other photo software using the same pictures. So,the problem isn't all in the pictures I have been taking.However, the camera yields excellent results in the photos and is easy to use. The camera is a steal for the price.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "This Camera Rocks!", "Author": "Ronald W.

Perfect for that small camera you want handy without hauling a bigger camera.  Sweet liitle zoom feature not typically on cameras of this size. Nice Wide angle feature.Only negative and its not really an issue but it uses a special Lithium battery that is included with the camera. So you can not just pop in a new set of AA/AAA.

I know it says so in the description, but that's just 2 words in a whole page of information, and why in heaven's name is it not included?  My last olympus camera included a picture card, and since the camera is virtually useless without a card then it makes no sense to not include it.  I found that really annoying as I had to go back and place another order for the card.

It is a casual point and shoot model with basic features.  Image quality is average to very good, depending on the situation.  In general, I find I get good pics most of the time.  Taking a little time to \"learn the camera\" will definitely improve your results.  The menu is simple and easy to use. It even has a \"guide\" section where you can flip through your image needs (e.g. shooting into strong backlight) and it will select the correct settings, as well as the usual \"scene\" modes.  A nice touch.  Has a \"panorama\" assist mode. Has some internal editing features (e.g. crop). 8 megapixels is plenty for most things, including prints up to 16x20 inches maybe even a bit larger. The Jpegs are good quality.It has a very nice and sharp lens with a range from 28mm-112mm (35mm equiv) making it great for group shots to portraits.  The 4x zoom works reasonably well and 4x is a decent range of coverage for a compact P&S.;  The camera is very simple to pick up and shoot with and the compact size makes this a great pocket camera.  The LCD screen is 3\" which is large and the quality is good.  The flash is fairly strong for a compact. As with all compacts, it can be a bit harsh sometimes, but it did reasonably well.The build quality is very good with a metal frame and plastic panels, it feels solid.  Buttons and controls work well and I find the camera very easy to use and intuitive.  I have not even looked at the PDF manual yet and have had no problems.  The camera has a pretty good feature set, the only thing really missing is full manual controls, auto exposure bracketing, and a few other advanced things that most users will never miss.  Operation is fairly quick, certainly par for this class.Color is good in most of the shots I've taken so far, especially outdoors in good light where the color is accurate and not overly vivid.  Video on this camera is std def (640x480) but decent and if you turn off the sound recording, you can use the zoom while shooting video which was novel when this camera was introduced.  Indoors I sometimes had to set the WB (white balance) manually for best results. True for many cameras of this type.This camera is now a couple of years old (came out in early 2008) and there are newer models available, but it is a solid camera, takes good pics, and is very easy to use.  If you can find it on sale at a good price, it might still be a good value.  I am very happy with mine.  I will try to post some sample shots in 'customer images' if I get time.Summary: A great pocket camera that you can carry with you and quickly pull out to take some \"on the spot\" shots knowing that you will get good results, especially if you take the time to learn the camera.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Only Lasted a Year", "Author": "Yogi Boo Boo", "ReviewID": "R206Z4CBEBIK79", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera almost exactly a year ago.  I work in real estate, and take a TON of pictures - I wanted something without a view finder, that would take good pictures with little lag time between shots and had the wide angle feature.  Not a lot of bells and whistles - no video or anything like that.  The picture quality both indoors and out left something to be desired - I agree with another review who said a lot of inside pics have yellow tones. This being said I was usually able to tweak the picture quality with Picture Manager to an acceptable level.  I didn't use the software that came with the camera so I can't comment on that.  The battery life is not great - I bought two extra batteries, and on a typical property inspection I will use all three batteries.  So, a year later the zoom button is not working consistently.  It gets stuck and then starts zooming in and out crazily.  So - here I am again looking for another camera a year later. I gave this three stars because overall it was adequate/average.  I wouldn't buy it again - but for my purposes I should have purchased something that was more of a workhorse than this I guess.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "lemon", "Author": "Melanie Thomas", "ReviewID": "RRZ47GS43NOA3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "bought this for my mother in law who is in her 60's...she took it on vacation...after two weeks it stopped working, but she won't send it in to have it looked at, just bought a new one.

I have used others' digital cameras in the past and didn't like the slow flash/shutter response and found the small view-finders difficult to use.I have absolutely loved this camera!!  I don't find any issue with the flash/shutter speed being delayed and like the large view-finder.  I've used the camera to take pictures of flowers and birds -- the results are very detailed pictures with amazing clarity.  The camera is especially good in bright daylight and takes adequate pictures in darker settings.The Olympus software is easy to use, allowing for some creativity beyond just the normal download.
