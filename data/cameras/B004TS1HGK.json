However what makes a good product Great, is the service you receive from the people who market and sell the product.  This is one of the few times there isn't a high enough rating for their service and communications.  And yes I have already purchased additional equipment from them and I will be getting more stuff from them this week as well.I don't feel there isn't a better Mid-level CCTV System out there for the money you spend, you really can't go wrong.  I just want to say Thank You for your support and looking forward to my future dealings with you as well.
