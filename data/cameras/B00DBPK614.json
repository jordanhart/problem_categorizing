Then Pentax Q7 is the camera you want.  If you are talking about the 24-80 FF , Aperture F2.8 or below lens range, you can find smaller ILC like the Panasonic GM1, or maybe even high end compact like RX100.  But talking about 70-200 FF, Aperture F2.8 or below.  You cannot find anything as small as Pentax Q7.  Adding the enthusiast level of buttons and the filters.  This is a very fun to use camera. However this camera is kind of hard to recommend because its capabilities is middle of everything.Price ($600 for 02 and 06 lens) makes it too expensive as a toy cameraImage quality and size, prevents you from recommending it over RX100 as its better travel cameraImage quality prevents you from getting as a backup camera for a DLSR as image is just like a compact camera.You cannot buy it also for its value because it loses price really quickly.To sum it up this is an okay camera, ok for almost anything you want, but you will definitely find something better in the category that you want it for.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DBPK614"}}
