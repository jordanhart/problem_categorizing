{"Reviews": [{"Title": "NOT worth the price", "Author": "Wes Oleszewski", "ReviewID": "R319SZ8PYN1JP4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product came out of the box with at least three defects. First off the power cord that attaches to the powerpack did not fit properly- in fact it looks as if the cord belongs to a totally different piece of equipment because it is molded to fit deeper into the socket so it sticks out by nearly 1/4 inch. Thus, the slightest movement of the cord causes the power to go out. Second, the USB mouse that came with the unit functioned only intermittently making access to the menues to do the set up nearly impossible. Third, while we were attempting to set up the network, camera #4 simply failed. It had power and was securly wired and its antenna properly in place, but it dropped into \"NO VIDEO\" and there it remained. The \"networking\" instructions were described by the professional networking person that I hired to be, \"Just a hack.\" In other words the system was designed to be a stand-alone and the networking idea was apparently an after-thought. The instructions have exactly ZERO information on who to contact for any sort of customer service- no web site, no e-mail, no phone number... nothing. So, although the makers may not want to tell me where to go for help, I do know where to send their machine- it was boxed and sent straight back to Amazon for a refund.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,529.99", "Features": "H.264 digital wireless\n4 channel system 16AM/QPSK/BPSK digital modulation\nDVR system with network function\nGraphical interface\nCamera has 24 IR LEDs for night vision", "Name": "Astrotel DVR-DIG4 2.4GHz H.264 Digital Wireless DVR System with 4 CCD Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21jzgpK--rL.jpg", "ProductID": "B005S6B0HI"}}
