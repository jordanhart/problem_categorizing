{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A camera that's powerful and a great value", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RU56CHCVV07UI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a DSLR and consider myself a photography enthusiast. I wanted a small compact camera with me when I don't want to lug around my DSLR + lenses and equipment. After a previous good experience with the Canon A720 IS, the new A590 IS seemed like a good choice. Since I'm an advanced photographer, I'll focus on the advanced features of this camera. The auto modes work as well as any other camera in its class, but the extensive manual features is what sets apart the Canon A series. What I like about the camera:+ Compact, stylish. It's smaller than older A Powershots, and the dark grey color gives it a seriousness compared to the typical bright silver finish.+ Image stabilization works very well, it allows me to take blur-free photos 2-3 stops below the recommended shutter speed, that means at 35-50mm f2.8 1/10 sec shots are CONSISTENTLY possible indoors without using flash.+ Good image quality. Expected from Canon, but even better is adjustable contrast, saturation, and sharpness settings, along with the typical JPG compression and resolution sizes.+ Fast and responsive. I was surprised how responsive this camera is even compared with my DSLR. Shutter lag is very low for a compact digicam, and when I pre-focus with manual focus, it's even faster.+ Manual modes. Aperture priority and shutter priority are great, the M mode is even better than other A Powershots such as the A720 because now there's a light meter on the right side that adjusts live based on what the camera thinks is the optimal exposure setting. And you can adjust aperture/shutter speed and see how it affects the final exposure. Ideally a live histogram would be even better, but this is very handy.+ Manual focus. Although the LCD resolution is not good enough, even with the point zoom option, manual focus helps in close-up work and pre-focusing for action or creative photography.+ Manual flash modes. In addition to automatic flash. The manual flash allows me to adjust the flash power in 3 levels, and prevents a pre-flash. This last part is important for using a remote optical slave flash. I can basically take professional looking studio pictures with this camera with my external flash equipment.+ Optical viewfinder. I don't use this much yet, but can come in handy in bright sunlight conditions, or when battery conservation is needed.+ Battery performance seems improved over previous A powershots too. The official specs give it 220 shots on regular alkalines and 500 on rechargeable NiMHs. Good news is they use common AA batteries that you can buy anywhere instead of proprietary models with specific chargers.Now the negatives. I hope Canon can improve these aspects in their future models.- Slow flash recycle times. This is to be expected from a camera that takes AA batteries. Would be nice if the LCD didn't blank out after a full flash discharge. Not a big deal since I use an external flash anyway, and the camera's flash is manually set to medium output as trigger (so recharge is faster). I would not want to give up the AA battery convenience for a faster flash recycle time though.- Higher resolution LCD. The 2.5\" 115k resolution LCD is ok for framing and casual browsing, but higher resolution would be nice.-Live histogram while shooting. This feature is available when reviewing a photo, but not live. Other manufacturers have implemented this, and Canon should also, especially since the unofficial CHDK software mod allows such a feature.- Larger aperture would be nice. Such as f/2.0 (instead of f/2.6) at the wide end, and f/4.0 (instead of f/5.5) at the telephoto end. That way a lower (& less noisy) ISO can be used in dim conditions or when fast shutter speeds are needed to freeze action. All the electronics in the world can't replace a good large lens. Also allows more creative depth of field control.- A wider wideangle would be nice, 28mm instead of 35mm (35mm equiv). I'd rather see a wider wideangle than a longer zoom.- Video feature is not ideal. Optical zoom is not available during recording of video. And the more efficient MPEG4 compression is not used, so video files tend to be large. Also noticed at 640x480 resolution, the highest fps is now 20 instead of 30 from other A models. A definite step backwards.- Noise at higher ISOs. This is due to the smaller sensor on compact cameras. But 8 MP is probably the most pixels that can be crammed into a small 1/2.5\" sensor. I'd rather have a cleaner picture at 6-7 MP than a noisy 8 MP picture. And if in-camera noise reduction is used, I'd like to see an adjustable setting for how much is being applied.- And if I were to be really critical: There's no indicator of what optical zoom level I'm at. Slight image noise is noticeable even at ISO 80 when I zoom in really close on a monitor view. When at the widest angle & aperture, there's slight barrel distortion and blurriness on the corners. Not many compact cameras can do better in terms of image quality, but I'm pointing them out here because even though this camera beats most of the competition, it still has room for improvement.So overall it's a great camera for the price. Offering great image quality with the auto settings for the casual user, but also a powerful set of features for the more advanced photographer.", "Date": "March 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hard to beat", "Author": "Julie Neal", "ReviewID": "R2MEX393N87IKC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These PowerShot \"A\" cameras are Canon's attempt to deliver the quality and features of its more expensive PowerShot \"G\" and PowerShot Pro \"S\" lines (such as full zoom lenses) at a budget price. The results are pretty good. (How do I know? Because I've actually gotten to use all of these cameras. I earn my living at Walt Disney World writing a travel guide, and nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShots.)Here's my opinion of the top-selling \"A\" series cameras:A580. This 2008 model is an A590IS (see below) without image stabilization and with semi-automatic instead of manual controls. I'd spend the extra bucks for the A590IS, because those two features can make quite a difference.A650 IS. You can do a lot with this sweet little camera, though it may be more than you need. It has a flip-out LCD panel and the option of manual controls. The shots I've seen from this model look great. Keep your ISO under 800 and you won't get any noise.A720 IS. This fully-loaded 2007 model has all the toys, including a 6x zoom (35mm film equivalent of 35-210mm), image stabilization, adjustable flash power and optional second-curtain flash. This last feature means you can make the flash fire at the end of a long exposure, instead of the beginning, so moving subjects streak into focus instead of out.A470. This 2008 camera is great for kids or anyone just looking for a good basic camera. It includes Canon's face detection technology and has a zoom lens, 14 shooting modes and the ability to set exposure compensation, ISO and white balance manually. Plus it looks great, and is a good bargain.Finally, the A590IS (the camera on this page) is a 2008 upgrade to an older model, the A570IS. The face detection system works a little better than the one on its predecessor, and the new model is slightly rounder and easier to grip. I personally like that it has automatic and manual controls, though I haven't seen anyone using the manual set yet. Overall this camera is a fine performer, a great bargain and I think the best buy of the bunch. I bought one for myself.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worth the extra $30 over the A570is with mostly same or better features", "Author": "BoaltGeek", "ReviewID": "R7G91UU7EOTA9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:The A590IS is the best point and shoot under $200 today (closer to $155 most places). I own an SD600 and my wife, friend, and father (all different people mind you!) own A570IS's. The A590IS is the new version of the A570IS, 2007's best selling camera. Generally, see the rave reviews of the A570IS if you want to know the major pros and cons (in summary: Image Stabilization is amazing, noise is limited, features of all there including manual controls [though no auto-bracketing which no other cameras at this price point have regardless], final picture quality is superior to all other brands at this price point and type, [i.e., point-and-shoot], good size).  Rather, here I'll address the main improvements over the A570IS (which is about $30 cheaper):(1) The A590IS has 8mp vs. 7mp on the A570IS (negligible difference)(2) The A590IS is slightly faster between non-flash shots BUT slightly SLOWER before the first shot can be taken and slower between shots where flash is used (less than .5 second difference according to CNet)(3) It's charcoal/gray - minor change from silver, but I like it a lot.(4) It's \"rounder\" on the edges but no less stable in your hand, neither camera is too slippery like other overly polished cameras (also, no finger smudges as a result).(5) There is sometimes increased noise with higher MP cameras, this is NOT the case here - noise levels are similar.(6) there are some minor additional shooting modes and improvements to other shootingCons:The only change that is not an improvement is the lowering of the frames per second in the video mode.A570IS: 640x480 = 30fps --- 320x240 = 60fpsA590IS: 640x480 = 20fps --- 320x240 = 30fpsFrankly, this is a bummer and cannon should correct it with firmware ASAP; however, the lower FPS is still quiet good, but this was a pointless change that is not appreciated -- the reality is that most people don't use video often and those who do will see a minimal difference ... if you're paying that much attention to the video you may be more interested in a different camera or a video camera.Conclusion:This will be the best selling camera of 2008 and it's a VERY safe purchase you won't regret (unless it gives you such a new found love for photography that suddenly you wish you had a Canon S5 or G7 ... which are more than twice as expensive!).", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Takes a licking....", "Author": "Jennifer K. Bretsch", "ReviewID": "R34S8063EEMVEE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are already great reviews out about Canon's A590is. I'd like to add that I bought this camera just before a 2-week trip to China. Well, it performed like a charm and I couldn't be more happy with my purchase, especially for such an affordable camera that has so many features. On the second day of my trip I was fumbling with the camera and dropped it from a height of 4 feet onto concrete. My heart was in my throat. Everyone stared. For the remainder of the trip the camera was just fine; not even a crack or scratch. I'm amazed. And because I had almost no time to look through the camera manual before I started taking photos, I'll add that this camera is very user-friendly and easy to figure out right out of the box. I especially like the image stabilization and video capture features. I was also pleasantly surprised by the long battery life. I took about 700 pictures on one set of batteries. Overall, a great camera.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Canon A590IS has it all.", "Author": "F. D. Gillett \"Comparison Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R2VZB9RG14YXIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The A590IS, based on price, is considered to be a budget or entry level camera.  However, especially at this price point, it is feature rich including many not found in more expensive models.  The feature set will appeal to a wide variety of people from those who want nothing more than an auto-focus point-and-shoot to the camera buff who wants a full set of manual controls, including manual focus, and to everyone in between.  I was especially pleased that Canon included a viewfinder on this model, something that is being dropped from many product lines in favor of only an LCD screen.  Anyone who has ever tried to compose a shot in bright sunlight only to find the LCD screen washed out or impossible to see will appreciate this feature.I applaud Canon for developing a small camera with more attention to function rather than to style and minimal size.  Many cameras can be found with dimensions smaller than a playing card or credit card but lack even basic controls, much less easy to use buttons.  While the A590IS may not fit in the pocket of your jeans, it will fit into a jacket pocket or a moderately sized shirt pocket.  Rather than being a flat or rounded rectangle this camera design feels good in your hand and feels secure during use.Performance and picture quality was another pleasant surprise at this price point.  Picture noise is not noticeable until ISO 400 and degrades rapidly at ISO 800 and above.  Translated to laymen's terms, this means your shots will be crystal clear unless you specifically set the ISO to a high number for non-flash, low-light shots.  Image stabilization is excellent throughout the three settings (off is also selectable).  There are three auto-focus modes plus off including face detect which will automatically detect up to 9 faces in a shot and adjust the camera settings automatically so that faces are correctly exposed in your shot.  Unless one of your subjects is moving fast, the camera detects the movement and adjusts according.  The 4X optical zoom is a rarity in this price range with most not exceeding 3X.  Combined with the 4X digital zoom you have a camera that is capable of mild wide angle to moderate telephoto.  Color rendition is excellent and I have read a number of technical reviews that place it as nearly perfect.  One of your many shooting options is \"vivid\" which increases contrast and heightens the colors in your shot.  The camera's ability to shoot movies with sound is better than expected.  However Canon did reduce the performance from the A590's predecessor to only 20 fps in 640x480.  To get 30 fps you must drop down to the 320x240 size.  Unlike my old digital, you can continue to shoot in movie mode until your memory card is full, not in shorter segments.  Redeye reduction is accomplished with two methods which can be combined or shut off entirely, a redeye light and digital correction.  Unfortunately, no camera manufacturer I am away of offers something that will work with pets so their eyes will often come out glowing green or gold in a flash shot.Canon's decision to power the A590IS with AA batteries was sound.  Avoiding a proprietary battery aided them in keeping the cost low.  Replacement of a proprietary battery can cost upwards of $40.  I would recommend purchasing a set of 2500 mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries and a good charger if you use your camera a lot.  If you find your batteries dying and unable to plug in your charger, you can always pick up a set of AA batteries nearly anywhere.  Battery life with the A590IS is reportedly one of the best with up to 450 shots.  But if you are like I am and use all the bells and whistles as well as flash, expect battery life to be much lower, typical with any camera.As with anything, there are always some cons.  Writing to the memory card is a bit slow, especially in continuous shooting  mode although still respectable for a camera in this class.  I found that it did improve when I upgraded to a faster SD card (class 6+).  As with all of Canon's A-series PowerShot cameras, flash recycle time leaves something to be desired approaching 5 seconds.  Unless you are someone who wants to take rapid-fire shots using a flash, performance is acceptable.  The LCD view screen is pretty low resolution and displays a lot of noise.  Much to my relief the actual shots turn out much better than what you see on the view screen.  When in movie mode with sound, I found that using the zoom or other buttons translates into an audible sound during playback.In summary, I suppose it is possible to find a budget camera that will exceed the A590IS in one or two categories but the Canon has good, solid, balanced performance in all areas.  I'd much prefer solid performance over stellar performance in one or two areas and below average performance everywhere else.  It is by no means a high-performance SLR, but at $149 I can buy 10 of these before approaching what I paid for my SLR 10 years ago and I don't need to drag along 2 camera bags to take good quality shots.  If I'd paid over $500 for the A590IS I'd probably rate it at 4 stars, but at $149 it earns a solid 5 stars for performance, features, and quality with the Pro's far outweighing the Con's.A note about using SDHC (high capacity) memory cards.  The a590IS comes with a regular 32mb SD card but can utilize the SDHC format.  Make sure your computer (or other device) can utilize the SDHC format before buying a SDHC card as the format is not the same as an SD card.  The SDHC is nearly idential in size and shape to the SD card which has led to some confusion.  However, all is not lost.  There are plenty of very inexpensive card readers out there that can read the SDHC format and upload to your computer or other device.  SCHC cards are most often found in 4gb, 8gb, and 16gb capacities.", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice features but way too much noise", "Author": "the engineer-historian", "ReviewID": "R2X04BXNK1VNEW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the A590 as a camera to keep with me in the book bag/briefcase that I carry around most every weekday.  You may recall the old saying that the camera you have with you (when you see a photo op) is your best camera.  The A590 fills that role by virtue of its small size combined with full exposure control.  The big problem is that the noise generated by putting 8 mpix on a tiny (1/2.5) sensor chip can overwhelm the image and render detail moot.I use Imagenomic NoiseWare combined with Photoshop Elements to reduce noise and sharpen the image as best I can. If possible I shoot at the lowest ISO setting, 80, which lowers the noise. I never go over ISO 100 if I can help it, and usually at -2/3 on the exposure control.  It's much better to have the photo-editing software brighten up the image than the amplifier boosting the signal (and noise) from the sensor.  When you play back the image on the camera's LCD, it should look a little dark -- never overly bright (which can also blow out details).Here are two other items about the Canon A-series cameras. My 15 year old son uses a Canon A720 for what are essentially snapshots and is very happy with it. If you don't crop substantially and aren't too picky about sharpness and noise, the camera is quite capable. From what I can tell, the A720 uses the same electronics (including the sensor and image stabilization) as the A590.  The A720 has greater zoom capabilities (and hence a different lens system) and is a little bit larger and heavier.  If I were going to get just one of these, I would go for the A720 because of the zoom.The second point is that the other camera I frequently use is a Canon A650, and it is far more capable than either the A590 or A720.  The A650 has 12 mpix on a larger sensor (1/1.7). Comparing sensor sizes (available at [...]) and mpix shows that the A650's sensor has 1.75 times the area as those of the A590 and A720 with only 1.5 times the pix -- hence pix density is lower and the noise generated by the A650 is much better controlled. And because there are more pix, the noise gets smoothed over as a result of more little points covering the same area in the image. (FYI: Greater pix density on a sensor chip creates more noise.)I did a noise and sharpness test with all three of these cameras plus my Nikon D40 DSLR.  I set two shoes, one black and one brown (the latter with lots of texture) on a rug, just beside a sunlit spot inside my house.  The shoes were well lit but not in direct sun.  I shot all of the cameras at 200 ISO (because that is as low as the Nikon would go) and f/5.6, with the exposure control at -2/3 of an f/stop.The results surprised me.  For whatever reason, and despite several tries, I could not get the Nikon to focus adequately on the shoes -- this from a distance of about four feet.  I know from experience that the Nikon D40, with 6 mpix on a 2/3 sensor (2/3 the size of a standard 35mm film frame) has extremely well controlled noise and excellent sharpness, but the inability to focus here took it out of the comparison.The superiority of the A650 to the A590 and A720 was startling.  Keep in mind that I \"zoomed\" in on the images in Photoshop after I had transferred them to my 24\" iMac (a great computer for photo editing).  This made different sections of the shoes appear much larger (the laces were really telling), and the 12 mpix A650 (vs. 8 mpix of the others) had more pixes to work with for any particular area I looked at.  Nonetheless, the other two cameras had so much noise that the details were overwhelmed and no amount of noise reduction and sharpening could change that. The A650's image was far sharper and clearer.The A650 has one other big advantage so far as I'm concerned and one drawback. The advantage is the articulating LCD, which I find extremely useful for many shots.  Yesterday, I had to lay down on the cold, damp ground to get a shot with the A590, but with the A650 I would have put the camera at foot level and looked down into the cocked LCD. That is really nice, almost addicting.  However, the A650's drawback is that it's bulky and surprisingly heavy, which is why I don't carry it along all the time.So you pay your money and take your choice -- or, like me, pay your money twice and have it both ways.  Remember, the camera that you have with you is the best camera you own -- so think about what size and type of camera you want to carry plus when and how you will use it.  For some people, that means owning more than one camera.", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Super Camera - Great Price", "Author": "LT4CE", "ReviewID": "R2X3GN8HIKZHJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera a little less than a month and have already taken 1200 pictures on it!  1089 of these were on on a trip to Alaska, while the rest were \"practice\" shots to become familiar with the camera.  I am very impressed with the results as the beauty of our trip comes through perfectly in the photos.I bought this camera as a backup to my aging Canon S2IS with its 12X zoom, just in case it decided to quit during the trip.  The S2 survived and was used almost as much as the 590 - just the opposite of what I expected.  The size and convenience of the larger LCD screen on the 590 quickly made it a favorite of mine, and my wife's.  Because the Canon controls were very similar on both cameras, it was easy to learn, and switch between cameras.  The newer Zoom Browser software is better than the S2's, but similar and was easy to learn.I have not figured out how to disable the flash on the Auto setting, other than after I turn the camera on.  The camera takes great shots inside with some light, and the flash washes some of these out, if used.  I feel the default setting should be \"Off\" for the flash, even in the Auto setting, but can understand why it is \"On\".  I just have to remember to turn the flash off whenever I turn the 590 on.The only complaint I had of the 590 was the slowness of taking a picture.  However, I discovered in my haste to get a new memory card before the trip, I had picked up an SD card, rather than an SDHC card.  I feel the new SDHC card I ordered will solve that problem.I used the Landscape setting for many shots of Mt. McKinley, Denali, glaciers, and others with great results.Thanks to Amazon and the reviews submitted by other 590 owners, I am really enjoying this PowerShot and the unbelievable beauty of Alaska that it captured!", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Optional Purchase", "Author": "B.

The A590IS is superior to the S2 in many ways. It's lighter.  It's smaller (about 10% smaller in length and height, and half the size of the S2, depth-wise.)  It uses 2 AA batteries instead of 4.  It has 8 megapixels instead of 5.  Best of all, it doesn't have a separate lens cap that likes to fall off all the time! (It has an automatic lens cover instead.)  However, the optical zoom is considerably less on this one (4x instead of 12x) and it's a bit more difficult to take videos (you have to put the camera in video mode with the A590, whereas with the S2 you just had to press the record button.)  One thing I really miss on the A590 is the rotateable LCD screen that the S2 had; but I guess if this camera had one of those, it couldn't be as small as it is!One of the reasons I chose this particular camera, as opposed to selecting one of the many other, smaller cameras currently on the market, was that this camera has a viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen.  Viewfinders on digital cameras are hard to come by anymore, but they are very useful if you're trying to take a picture when it's bright outside (making the LCD picture almost impossible to see.)Overall, I am happy with the A590IS.  I like the fact that it's small (by no means the smallest camera on the market, but small enough for my purse or even a coat pocket).  I like that it can take good photos in many different conditions.  I am most impressed with its ability to get good shots outside at night, even without the flash.  I took a photo of some friends in front of a Ferris wheel at the fair.  The sun had just set, so the sky was dark, and while there were lights around from the rides, the lighting conditions weren't ideal.  The photo still came out beautiful and bright, with the lights from the Ferris wheel noticeable, yet my friends weren't washed out or too dark in the photo.  I also took \"experimental\" shots of the different rides at the fair.  Depending on which mode I used, I could either get a clean shot of a lit-up ride with the black sky in the background, or I could get an \"artsy\" shot (while the ride was moving) using a setting where the shutter was a bit slower.A few cons: The battery life isn't anything to write home about; I had to change the batteries twice during a recent 5-day vacation (to compare, I only had to change the batteries once on a 10-day vacation with the S2 a few years ago.)  Also, I still get blurry photos from time to time, for no apparent reason.  The subject is still, my hands are steady, and yet photos can still turn out blurry.  This can be kind of frustrating.  This used to happen with the S2, too, though, so maybe it's just me.If you want the smallest camera on the market, or one with the most megapixels or zoom capabilities, then the A590 may not be for you.  If you want a camera that's kind of in the middle of everything (except picture quality), check this one out.

It is easy to use, takes great pictures, and has plenty of zoom.  I looked at so many cameras before purchasing this one.  This one had the best features and quality of all the cameras in this price range.  I was really impressed with the quality of the video it produced, as I didn't expect very much from a digital camera.I am glad I got a camera with a view finder as I have found on very sunny days at the ballfield, the LCD can be a little difficult to see details of what you are capturing.  The viewfinder, though, shows you enough of what you are shooting and comes in handy.The night scene mode really is a blessing as I have taken night shots with and without this mode, and it makes such a huge difference in night photography.Speed is not an issue as well.  I took a picture of my son jumping into the pool and I caught him just as he was entering the water.  There was relatively no blur and it looks as if he is standing on top of the water!I also took pictures of him throwing a baseball and there was no blur in those photos as well.Again, this camera exceeded my expectations and I doubt that anyone would be disappointed in purchasing this camera.

The old saying is that the best camera for the job, is the camera you have!!  I did not wish to spend a lot of money but wanted to still have image stablization, control over exposure and aperture,  and decent image quality, all while using SD memory cards since I have many.  This camera is a reasonable compromise.  The images are acceptably crisp and can be made even sharper in post processing, the manual controls work great, and the size certainly allows me to put it into my pocket.  If you are looking for a snapshot camera the Canon A590 can certainly produce the goods.  I haven't found the slow recycle time of the flash to be a problem and and the rechargeable NiMH batteries I'm using are still going strong after a couple of hundred pictures with about a third being taken with flash.  You can adjust the vividness of the color along with the sharpness and the contrast to taste.  The exposures seem accurate and exposure conpensation can be used to help with \"blown\" skies, a problem with many digital cameras, it seems.Having the memory card located with the batteries certainly saves in manufacturing cost (only a single door) but when I remove the card, sometimes the batteries also fall out, but this isn't really a serious issue - I just have to be careful.I do wish that this camera had a wider angle lens (maybe 24 mm equivalent in 35 mm camera terms) since there are times I want effects that these wide angle lenses produce.  Of course I knew that the camera did not do this when I bought it and many casual users would probably not miss this feature unless they previously had a camera that a lens of this type.In summary, given this camera's price point, it's an excellent value.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon A590IS - Possibly Good Camera With Some Flaws", "Author": "JWCPA", "ReviewID": "R3TZKZJ5U6K19V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would rate this camera only as average at this time because of the battery problems outlined below. Have not used the camera enough to rate the quality of the photos, features, and general operation at this time. Also, the included SD card with the camera was a measly 32 MB, basically nothing in this day and age of large image files and cheap memory. To get decent photos capacity and a spare, I bought two on-sale Kingston 2 GB SD cards, one from Meritline.com for ca. $7 (free shipping) and one locally at Inkspot for ca.  $5.My advice to others is that if you suspect your camera has a problem not due to your use/handling and the camera is still under warranty; return it ASAP to Canon for repairs.I bought camera early last December as a Christmas present, from Amazon since it seem to have the best price at the time including free shipping. Selected this camera model based on Consumer Reports' recommendation, mostly favorable user reviews on Amazon and some ther websites, and the camera price and features. I was a bit concerned about some reviewers complaining of low battery life, but thought perhaps they were a small minority, maybe their problems were due to the way some used thier cameras/settings, and there's always a few lemons sold in any product line.2. The camera out of the box seemed to be functional for all the features I tested, but after playing with the camera to learn how to use it, and a few dozen shots, the low battery inidcation came on. after a few number more shots (est. a few dozen), the battery replace indication came on and the camera shut down. These were the Panasonic alkaline AA batteries that came with the camera. At this time my voltmeter measured the batteries at ca. 1.35v.3. To reduce power use, changed some settings to turn LCD off after a short time, and the IS (Image Stabilization) from always on to on only during shots. Put in new Berkley & Jensen (BJ's) alkalines, same low battery indication after a few dozen shots. After about a dozen more shots, the replace battery indication came on and the camera shut down. After checking the battery contacts, letting the camera sit for a while, etc., no change in behavior, i.e. camera can be turned on for a few shots with low battery indication on, then change battery indication comes on and camera shut down. The BJ's batteries voltage was 1.45v at this time.4.  A friendly camera repair place person told me about the Canon website online repair setup and gave me an Internet address, but even then it was not easy to find page, the website search did not find it for me. Go to any consumer camera model support; look at the bottom part of the page for links to \"Repair Request\" or \"Repair & Tracking. Gee, I wonder why Canon doesn't make it obvious, could it be that they really don't want to hear from us, especially for warranty stuff... ?!?![...]So I decided to return camera to Canon for warranty repair (no cost except my shipping camera to them). I mailed the camera (included 2 sets of batteries I used) to Canon's Elk Grove Village, IL facility by US Mail, insured and with post office deliver confirmation. Canon received it in a few days, confirmed receipt to me via E-mail, and I received it and my batteries back by FedEx ca. 3 days later. Factory documentation returned with the camera noted that:- Low batteries was cause of problems, said nothing about any adjustments (\"Unit has battery shortage. Check all functions, repair to good working order.\"), but since the camera behaves differently after getting it back, I suspect they adjusted both the battery low and the battery replace indicators' voltage threshold settings even though nothing was said about it.- \"...found the optical assembly was inoperative and the focus did not operate properly. Adjustments were carried out on the optical assembly.\" I did not notice any wildly out of focus photos by the out-of-the-box camera using the Auto focus mode; perhaps they're addressing the manual focus mode that I did not test.5. After I received the camera back from Canon, I put in the original used Panasonic and BJ's akalines (approx. 1.35v and 1.45v, respectively, similar to as previously measured), and still got the low battery indication with both sets.6. Decided to put in a new set of BJ's alkalines, measured at ca. 1.59V. Camera set for AUTO mode, IS on only during shots, face detection on. Occasionally used the zoom feature, once or twice for every 25 set of shots. - After 100 shots in succession, most with flash used, battery voltage checked to be ca. 1.43v. - After 32 more shots, low battery indication came on, did 12 more shots, turned camera off, batteries checked at ca. 1.35v - When camera turned back on, low battery indication not on, but came on again after 5 shots. When got up to 191 shots total, camera to off, batteries checked to be ca. 1.38v. - Turn camera back on, low battery indication on again after 13 shots, camera off, checked batteries at ca. 1.34v. - At 204 total shots with the set of new BJ's alkalines, the battery replace indication came on, and the camera shut down shortly after. Can turn on camera again of 2-3 shots before the replace indication/shutdown occurs again. The number of shots here appears to match the camera manual specification page that list ca. 200 shots for akaline batteries.7. For the second set of testing, I used a fully charged set of Ultra Pro NiMH 2500 mAH-rated AA batteries (ca. 1.43v - 1.45v measured). Made all shots indoors, those where flash used were of house interior, those without flash used was through window (daylight). - Erased all the previous 217 images from the SD card. - After 150 shots, half with flash, half without, no low battery indication, turned camera off for ca. 45 min. for lunch. - When camera turned back on, low battery indication showed, camera off, checked batteries at ca. 1.33v. - When camera turned on, no low battery indication showed, but indication showed again after 23 shots using flash, continued to 25 shots using flash. - Continued shooting 25 shots at a time alternating between flash and no flash, for 175 more shots. After a total of 350 shots (half with flash) have been taken with the NiMH batteries, batteries measured ca 1.27 - 1.29v. - Continued shooting 25 shots at a time alternating between flash and no flash, for 150 more shots. After a total of 500 shots (half with flash) have been taken with the NiMH batteries, batteries measured ca 1.26 - 1.27v now. At this point, I gave up test shooting, as I have not seen the battery replacement indication after 500 shots. The number of shots here appears to in line with the camera manual specification page that list \"approx. 450 images\" for NiMH batteries. Fooled around for few more test photos, and the battery replace indication/camera shutdown occurred after ca. dozen flash shots past 500.8. Some observations about the camera: - It looks like I'll have to accept the low battery indication on most of the time. My guess is that there some kind of design and/or manufacturing defect where the camera electronics/software does not accurately detect how much of the battery capacity is remaining. Judging from the various user reviews, it may not be present in all sold units of this model, as not everyone sees this problem. However, if the camera can perform OK for several hundred shots until the battery replacement indication/shutdown (esp. with NiMH which I want to use), I can live with that. - The flash can take more than 5 sec. to recover for the next flash shot. - The camera seems to work differently on alkalines vs. NiMH 2500 mAH-rated rechargables, as it continues working at lower voltage for rechargables. I know that the discharge curves, and capacity and voltage ratings for the alkalines and NiMH batteries are different, the alkaline are rated at 1.5v (actual ca. 1.6v new), and rated capacities numbers can be similar to the NiMH (over 2500 mAH). The NiMH batteries are rated at 1.2v (actual ca. 1.4v new), capacities can be vary (typ.1000-2800 mAH). The initial voltage of both battery types drops fairly quickly from their nominal ratings during use  but after the initial drop, the NiMH types tend to have a flatter voltage vs. use time curves than the alkalines. - Since battery monitors typically can only see voltage as an indirect measure of capacity remaining, why should the camera decide that the lower NiMH battery voltage is still OK, while a higher voltage on the alkalines is not? If the alkalines and NiMH rated capacities can be simialr, why don't they perform similarly, or are the alkaline capacity ratings done differently than the NIMH? Canon's camera documentation implies the camera treats the battery types differently as it explicitly notes the performance difference in their camera spec. for nominal number of shots for alkalines vs. NiMH batteries. My Internet research also seems to indicate that the battery rating numbers may or may not all be done via a standard method, and different manufacturers' batteries can perform significantly differently under the same conditions, so as to make the capacity ratings less than useful.12/31/12 Batteries Update:See my 6/25/12 and 12/31/12 updated post in the Comments to this review.", "Date": "January 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with a Major Problem", "Author": "Charles Whitlatch \"cwhitla\"", "ReviewID": "R2TF4N4W5Z5PH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wanted a small camera that took decent photos in available light and had high ISO sensitivity. Image stabilization and a wide range of manual setting were also high on my list. This camera delivers all of that. I was pleased with the quality of the shots even up to ISO 800. ISO 1600 was roughly equivalent to what ISO 400 was on my previous small Canon camera so the A590 IS can cover a lot of range in lighting situations. What caught me almost totally by surprise was the extremely poor battery life. Even without using the flash it seems abysmal. I have taken approximately 60-70 test shots and gone through 2 sets of alkaline and one charge from a pair of NiMH rechargeables. Admittedly this was using the flash about 30% of the time but that's still totally unacceptable. I realize that AA batteries don't have the life of a proprietary lithium ion, but this camera's battery life is so bad it makes it almost unusable to me. Seemed like whenever I turned around it was telling me that the batteries were low and needed replacement. I used a battery tester to check them and found that they still registered pretty good so I'm wondering if the camera's battery level sensitivity is just wrong. Either that or this thing sucks power worse than any camera I have ever owned. Whatever the case, I am truly sorry I purchased this otherwise fine camera. I would  much rather have decent battery life than the dubious \"convenience\" of replacing AA cells all the time.Update: With freshly charged 2500 mAh Ni-MH cells I am seeing an improvement in battery life, at least initially. So far I've taken 36 pictures and no low battery message yet. My previous usage was more intermittent so we'll see if these higher capacity rechargeable bring the camera up to what I consider reasonable battery life.

Morales", "ReviewID": "R2S4O5MVMPJAJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So allow me to start by saying i'm just your average \"joe-user\" who enjoys snapping photos while on vacations and out with friends. Recently i owned an Olympus Stylus 810 and was very, very pleased with it. Unfortunately i dropped it damaging the entire lens assembly and it was going to cost $140 to repair. With a week at the beach coming up i didn't have time to research a lot. On a friends recommendation i made this purchase.Now my goals are to have a smaller sized camera that will allow nice point and shoot photography but has some manual (even minimal) controls as i do enjoy photography and if i decide to go further, i'll be familiar with the manual controls and such. So after getting this camera i did a few test runs to get it all working w/ my MacBook Pro laptop. Here's my experience thus far:Install on Windows Vista and Mac OS X Leopard were both absolutely flawless. Software went right in, once connected downloading the images and viewing them was a one click event. The software bundled is actually quite nice. I no longer have iPhoto (thanks Leopard) so i was unsure what to use for basic photo management. Not to worry Canons bundled software, \"ZoomBrowserEX\" does a fantastic job of that.Now as far as options go i'm by no means skilled in the realm of cameras, however from my limited experience i can say this camera packs quite a large array for such a small price tag. The auto modes work very well, not to mention having the ability to just pop it into \"Manual\" mode and tweak by hand! All it takes is 20-30min of reading on the internet and you can be messing with the settings and taking some great low light, artistic, etc... photographs. I also found it's quite easy to use single handed. A lot of times on my beach trip i was holding onto a rock to balance myself and only had my right hand available. Switching into say \"Macro\" mode is very simple. Same goes for things like zoom, flash, etc... overall very user friendly design.Picture quality has been absolutely stunning! I truly did not expect it from a camera under $160. As with most \"point and shoot\" cameras when upping the ISO level to take dim light shots without a flash it does tend to get grainy. Although this camera does counter balance that a little, and does a good job, it's still noticeable. That's where the \"Manual\" mode came in for me. Being able to adjust shutter and aperture etc... really allowed me to take some exceptional low light shots that are not grainy at all.So my overall impression is absolutely pleased! For the money i doubt you'd find a better camera with as many features that can produce the quality of photos this can. I was impressed to see how small it is in person and exactly just how well constructed it feels. Also the thing i loved is there's a huge wealth of accessories like extra lenses such as telephoto, macro, lens filters, etc... Amazon has a \"kit\" that looks like a fantastic deal that comes with most of those things including a tripod. That is definitely going to be my next purchase.So if you're looking for a great camera that can \"point and shoot\" and has the manual controls if you think you may be interested in getting into photography, this is my recommendation hands down. I posted 11 photos in the \"Customer Photos\" section. Feel free to check them out to hopefully get an idea of what this camera can do with \"default\" settings, i was blown away. Lastly as i'm finding out photography is all about your \"eye\" and knowing enough about your hardware to capture what you \"see.\" I'm not much for taking pictures of people i really enjoy closeups and different angles, so that's what i'm learning to capture with this camera. Hopefully my pictures will be a decent display of what this camera can do. Just remember if you don't like your photos it's probably not the cameras fault! There will never be a one stop solution, but overall this one is fantastic!Hope it helps,Happy picture taking,Frank L.

The Konica had a 12X optical zoom, one of the reasons I purchased it in the first place.  But the 12X optical zoom made the camera a little bulky.  Too bulky to slip into my coat pocket or a small carrying case.  Because of that, I found myself taking fewer and fewer photos.  Enter the Canon PowerShot A590 IS.  So far, I am totally happy with this camera.  First of all, its size is perfect for me.  It fits neatly into a coat pocket, or sometimes into even my pants pocket.  Though it only has a 4X optical zoom, its 8MP ability allows me to PhotoShop the scenes I can't zoom in on enough with very little loss of resolution.  I take the majority of my photos at the 5MP setting.  At this setting, with a 4 Gb card, I can store over 2700 photos.  The color settings are great too.  I have the options of B/W, sepia, neutral, vivid, and custom.  And the vivid setting lives up to its meaning; the colors just pop!  I also chose this camera because of the shutter and aperture priority settings; I like to make my own settings on occasion.  Most of the compact digitals out there now no longer allow that.  But it still has enough presets for those who don't want to fiddle...full auto, easy, program, portrait, landscape, night snapshot, kids & pets, indoor, sunset, and video.  Since I haven't taken any video with it yet, I can't comment on that feature.  The view screen doesn't have as many pixels as some of the other compact digitals.  So if you compare what you see on the view screen with those having more pixels, it won't be as sharp and clear.  But don't think that will take away from the actual finished photo...it doesn't.  The view screen image on most digitals is very hard or next to impossible to see in bright sunlight.  That's why this camera is great.  It has a viewfinder; something else one doesn't see much any more.  It may seem a bit old-fashioned, but when the sun is at your back and you're trying to frame your subject, and the view screen becomes useless, you'll be very glad you have a viewfinder.

After using the camera for a few weeks I have determined that it actually does produce very sharp, nicely color toned pictures if you simply put it on AUTO or P, point, remember to hold the shutter half way down for a second to focus, and shoot. Perhaps learning when to force the flash to provide fill would be a handy, not too complicated step to learn, one which would greatly improve most backlit shots. I'm still trying to teach that :-) (it's only one button, hey!!)but I think I will eventually succeed. All in all, you can carry it anywhere and use it quickly and easily and without any real knowledge or skill manage to eke out a decent (if not really lovely) exposure.If you understand something about how modern cameras are programmed, the manual controllability of this little demon will delight you. In bright light situations, it's a good thing to be able to use the traditional viewfinder which is not always provided these days in many other point and shoots. And if you wanted a quality shot, understanding how to use the many features intelligently, I think you will be amazed that the file  produces such a high quality photograph. Five years ago it would have cost many hundreds more to achieve this quality, and now it's available for a pittance. Progress.I haven't delved into the technical aspects of this camera here because I am assuming that most people who are looking for this kind of one would not be that interested.

Two AA batteries were included, which only lasted two days (which I expected from regular batteries). I've since bought rechargeable batteries, based on other reviewers' advice.Memory card: A memory card is included, but it only has enough room for about twenty pictures. Just enough to test the camera out and take a few practice photos of my office. Good thing I ordered another memory card along with the camera.View finder: Not only does this camera have the standard digital camera \"screen\", it also has an old-fashioned (like from regular cameras) view finder. I like this because I can take a picture even if there is glare on the digital screen. Also I find it helpful to look through the small view finder when there is a lot of motion.Easy shot: The \"easy\" mode is really truly easy, and it produces really good pictures.Design: Aside from the price, I picked this camera after looking at it in a retail store because of the user friendly design. Unlike many other digital cameras, it is not a small thin square. It has a rounded side that makes it easy to grip and more substantial feeling.

I spent a bit of time learning about the features, trying them out, testing the camera, and finally, USING the camera.All in all I am mostly pleased with this camera.  My previous digital camera was an Olympus D550 zoom, which took great pictures and was very easy to use.  The Canon camera is also easy to use, if you want to keep it in AUTO mode, which I often do.  If you want to use a different mode or change one of the settings, there are so many different combinations and possibilities that I find it can be a bit overwhelming.  I think I just need to get used to it more.  I thought I was pretty proficient with it at first, but if I don't use it frequently and consistently, I tend to forget which menu the feature I'm looking for is on.One thing I really like about this camera is the feel of it in my hands.  I was torn between one of the smaller Camera SD models and this one, but the A590 felt so good and comfortable in my hand, I figured it would be easier to hold it steady. (My sister has a Canon SD camera and it is so small, her pictures often come out blurry because she has difficulty holding it steady when she takes a shot.)  My old Olympus was much bigger than either camera, so I figured the A590 would be an improvement over it and I shouldn't worry so much about the size.  I also liked the idea of having it use AA batteries, vs. the Canon rechargable one in the smaller cameras.  (While on vacation, my sister would go to take a picture and lament that her battery needed charging.  With AA batteries, if you run out of power, just go buy more.)I am pleased with the photos I have taken so far, for the most part.  It does not do well outdoors at dusk, but my Olympus didn't, either, and I suspect more savy users would know what to set to make these kinds of photos come out better.  One thing I noticed in a lot of my photos is that if there is a lamp or light near the subject, or if the subject is near a window letting in bright light, you'll get a bright, overexposed area in the photo.  I never noticed this problem with my Olympus, and friends/relatives who have taken shots of the same subject with their cameras did not have this problem.  For this reason I am taking away one star.One thing I was concerned about after reading a lot of the reviews here was bettery life.  I preferred a camera that ran on AA batteries, but not if it was going to eat up batteries.  My Olympus ran on 4 AA batteries, so I bought rechargeable ones.  The A590 only uses 2 AA batteries, so I figured I'd be changing batteries often.  Not so!  I started off using the 2 Panasonic batteries that came with the camera.  I figured I'd use them up just playing with the camera.  I kept turning it on and off as I was reading the manual, trying the different menus and features.  Surely they'd be dead in a couple of days.  Nope.  I took many test shots in different lighting, with different settings, and downloaded them to my laptop.  Still the batteries continued working.  I took a LOT of photos at my and my husband's anniversary party, when all our relatives came in from out of town, but still the batteries lasted.  Then I took the camera on a trip and took many more photos, then a couple of birthdays, then my son's college apartment and STILL the batteries lasted. (I must've taken over 100 photos, not to mention my training sessions).  It's been a month since I've used the camera and just now I noticed the low battery warning is coming on, so I replaced the Panasonics with 2 rechargeable batteries.I am happy with my purchase.  When I compared photos that I took with my camera with the same photos my relatives took with their digital cameras, many of them much more expensive than my A590, I generally preferred my photos, and at the very least my photos were equally as good.  As I mentioned above, the only photos that weren't as good was when there was bright light from a window or lamp near (though not necessarily behind) the subject.UPDATE 12/15/08:The first time I reviewed this camera, I had only used it on a few occasions.  I was pretty happy with it at the time.  However, it's been six months and the more I use it, the unhappier I become with it.  It's enough to make me consider buying a new, different camera. I wonder if it's too late to return it to Amazon.Yes it's easy to use and yes, it has a lot of nice features.  But generally it doesn't take very good pictures.  Some shots come out very nice - especially ones taken outdoors in full light.  But there are too many problems with pictures taken if the light isn't just so.  If there is a light on in the background, you get bright halos around the light source.  If you use natural light on indoor shots, the colors look washed out.  Even indoor shots taken with the flash look washed out.Then there's the problem with batteries.  If I buy regular batteries, they seem to last pretty well.  If I use chargeable batteries, I get about 2 or 3 shots before the low battery light comes on, and maybe 2 or 3 after that before they need to be replaced.  Someone suggested that maybe the problem was with the batteries or my charger, but I didn't have this problem with my old camera, which used the same batteries/charger.  The fact that regular batteries last much longer does give merit to this theory.I now give this camera 2.5 stars because of the so-so photos it takes, and the somewhat faded looking colors.  If I had to do it again, I would buy a different camera.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "S.

I'm not a pro but love taking high quality pictures.  So far, my PowerShot A590IS has exceeded my expectations!Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomI've only had my Canon A590IS for a few months, but I love it!  The pictures are great and it's easy to use.  To me this seems like a great camera for the price.  It's my first Canon, and it's superior to the pocket digitals that I've owned previously.The Canon brand name, the features, and the price sold me on the PowerShot A590IS.  Specifically, I wanted a high-quality name brand camera, relatively small digital camera, for less than $200- that had 8.0 megapixels resolution, a large LCD monitor screen, at least a 4x optical zoom, a viewfinder for sunny days, video with sound capability, that uses SD memory cards.  The A590IS includes all of these, plus some additional features that I'm enjoying.When you turn the camera sideways for a vertically oriented picture, the camera adjusts so that you don't have to rotate the downloaded images, later.  Also, the processor is the same that Canon uses in their high-end digital SLR professional quality cameras.  There's also an optical image stabilization feature that reduces the number of blurry images as a result of photographer movement.[...]My only concern is that the LCD Monitor Screen is virtually flush with (even with) the camera's body, in other words, the screen isn't protected from scratches and damage.  To help protect the LCD monitor screen, I've added an inexpensive plastic collapsible digital camera LCD monitor shade.  There are numerous brands on the market.  I'm using an eFilm DU 2.5\"-M made by delkin.com.  It cost less than $10-, fits well, gives great shading of the LCD for sunny days outside.  It includes a thin clear plastic screen protector which does not adhere to the LCD monitor screen, but sits about 1/16\" above the LCD.  This attached device adds only about 1/4\" of thickness to the rear of the camera, when collapsed.  In addition, the LCD Monitor pop-up cover has a quick-removal feature.I read a good recommendation in another review link regarding Canon cameras.  That's to store the camera in the picture \"review\" mode (used for viewing pictures already taken)as opposed to \"shoot\" mode (used for taking still pictures and video).  That way if the power on/off button is accidentally pressed, the lens mechanism won't be activated in a camera case, purse, or pocket--potentially damaging the mechanical optical lens mechanism.For me, a service contract makes sense.  In my case I bought my Canon A590IS and 1-year service contract from another online source.  The price now, however, is less at Amazon.com with a 2-year service contract, than I paid, elsewhere.I'm pleased with the image quality, the camera's ease of use, the features, the price, and the look and feel of the A590IS.

Kudos to RLSd, F. Gillett, & Molly P., among others.  Forget the stars - it was their accurate realistic detail that really helped.  Lacking their expertise, I'll confine myself to a few areas that concerned me until I actually used the A590IS.  This was partly due to other reviews that weren't as well done.First is the size and \"chunkiness\" issue.  It's chunkier than some of its peers, but only a bit.  It slides into a jacket or jeans pocket very nicely.  In exchange for the chunkiness you get a camera you can grip securely and hold steady.  You also get a shape you are far less likely to drop, even holding it in one hand while scrambling over the rocks.  Finally, you get a view finder, not just a screen.  During a recent two weeks in Greece, that was a Godsend, as the bright Aegean sun totally wiped out the electronic image.Second there is the battery issue.  I read complaints from folks who said the camera ate batteries and died after too few shots.  I'm not sure what was going on there, but you need to research the batteries the way you did your camera.  The new Energizer lithium batteries got off about 400 shots, half with flash, before I had to replace them.  And because it was a new toy, I was constantly using the camera to show my shots to my wife, which burned still more power.  Hard to beat that.  Are they the right choice for everyone?  Maybe not.  They are not rechargeable, so there's an ecological price to pay.  Around the house I may switch to something greener, but for overseas trips, I'll stick with them.Another issue is the lag time between flash shots.  Let's be real.  If you want instant turn-around time, you shouldn't be looking at a $130 camera that uses a pair of AAs.  If you want a camera for fast-breaking sports and photo-journalism, don't get an A590IS. That said, I didn't think it took insufferably long.  I can't think of any shots I failed to get due to recycle time.Some folks had tales of woe about taking all these wonderful shots, only to have them disappear from the chip.  When the camera arrives, read the little book, esp. the part on formatting your chip.  That should prevent such sorrow from striking.Incidentally, one little discussed but really cool feature is the zoom capability when examining photos already in the can.  You can zoom in to an incredible degree and find things in pix you've already taken that you didn't even know was there.  (Honestly, honey, I had no idea she was topless.)  I was stunned by the clarity.Do I have any complaints? A few.  The manual is good but it has one of the worst indexes I've ever seen.  Don't assume it omits a topic just because it isn't in the index.  Flip through the pages and you'll find what you need.  On occasion, I was disappointed in the inability of the camera to handle sharp lighting contrasts.  Granted, Greek sunlight and shadow can create some extreme challenges, but it's still a limiting factor.  The flash is useful but don't ask too much of it.  You have to be quite close to your subject, esp. at night.  If you are outdoors, it's easy to be too far away without realizing it.I guess that's about it.  My bottom line is that I love this camera and I'm pleased and amazed with the shots I brought back from my recent trip.  It's a great transitional camera for someone like myself who finally decided to leave his old 35mm gear and give in to digital.  The auto setting is really good, but it permits manual control as well.  Am still experimenting with that but am encouraged by what I see.

I normally don't write reviews, but I started looking for a new (additional) camera with a longer lens which got me to realize what a terrific buy this was. I have taken super pictures with it. I don't understand some of the reviews that complain of battery life. I've had a great experience with battery life. Now if I can only find a comparable camera with a much longer lens I would be very happy. The newer cameras have a gps for some reason and no optical viewfinder which is necessary in bright light situations. Dropping the optical viewfinder was a big mistake and many of the new bells and whistles hardly make a difference. I don't understand why manufacturers don't build on previous successes and instead wander off into the great unknown. As someone who is only interested in stills, I would like not to sink money into movie capabilities and gps's. Cannon seems to be asleep at the wheel. Don't they notice that the A590 is selling for many times its original price? Apparently not. Why could they not have simply improved on the 590 with a longer lens and possibly more pixels? Too easy?

I have yet to explore all of the features, and perhaps some of the problems I have would be solved if I did (so if anyone has more experience with this camera and has any suggestions to my problems I would sure appreciate it!) It's been a pretty good camera - certainly good for the money, and though I have had some issues all in all I've been happy with it. I bought it almost exclusively to take pictures of my son - who was about 6 months old at the time of purchase - and while the quality of pictures is certainly better than the last camera I had (dinosaur), the shutter-speed is slow (typical of digital cameras) and the 'ready light' is so bright that most living subjects - especially a baby - have to look away. Likewise I find the flash to be SO bright that many of my pics are ruined by the severity of the light, but without it the quality is pretty bad. Therefore I frequently find myself taking 200 pictures in the hopes that maybe 20 will be decent enough to keep. My son is very photogenic, its just hard to get the pics I want with the speed, and honestly that light is just awful (in order to get a good close-up head-shot, that orange ready-light has to be right in your eyes... Ouch). But again this is all fairly typical of digital cameras in general, so I don't hold it against this particular cam too much (what I really need is a REAL camera, with REAL film, but that costs REAL money which sadly I just don't have. REALLY!). Its small and very comfortable to hold and use, which is great cuz I have small hands. The red-eye-remover function only works maybe half the time -and yes I've tried different settings-, but when it does work its super. And the zoom is decent, although the quality changes completely, becoming a bit fuzzy (I actually really like the effect, its super clear but at the same time fuzzy - hard to explain but zoomed pics look beautiful and vibrant to me) but its not good enough to take a picture of something very small, like a large spider, which is unfortunate for me cuz that's a hobby of mine. But I love the freedom of knowing I can get a better lens for it if I choose, and look forward to seeing how that affects the zoom and picture quality. Anyway some of my favorite features are the view-finder (so rare in a digi-cam) the PHENOMENAL night-shots (some of the BEST pictures I've taken with this camera have been in pitch-darkness, so at those times I praise the flash! It is UNREAL how good a pic you can take when you can't even SEE your subject!), as well as the video feature, which I use a lot (love being able to immortalize special moments in live-action with the ease of pressing a button on something smaller than my wallet)! Also love being able to preview pics -it automatically gives you a quick preview of the last pic you took, which is awesome- and of course you can look at and edit all of them in-camera quickly and easily. Whether I use the video or not though, the battery life is pretty bad. I can't use regular batteries AT ALL anymore, even to take ONE picture - they HAVE to be rechargeable. Frustrating, especially since it wasn't like that when I first got it. Meaning, I guess, that with frequent use something happens internally, which is worrisome. Regardless of the probs though, I give this camera 4 out of 5 stars, simply for value, simple features, ease of use and quality of some of the priceless pics I HAVE gotten out of it. And again there's a lot of features I've never even used yet!

She wanted a digital P&S; that had an optical finder.  There are not too many of these--Canon is the only one I could think of, and not even all canons have an optical finder. Some just have the LCD screen.I tried a few shots at home before we left on a trip to Europe.  It seemed to be working all right, so we took it along.  She also brought her trusty Olympus Stylus film camera, \"just in case.\"Here's what we found out:  first, the camera turned out to be a battery eater.  According to the instructions, you should get about 200 shots on a pair of AA alkalines.  Well, my wife got more like 30 or 40.  One set of batteries was good for about 4 to 6 hours of shooting.  She couldn't get a whole day of shooting out of it, even though she turned the camera off when not shooting.  Fortunately, I had several sets of spares along.  When these ran out, I bought four Kodak AA alkalines in a Paris store.  They were gone in a couple of days, so we made a shopping thrip and bought some German batteries.  They were maybe a little better--she shot for several hours in the Musee de l'Orangerie.I am thinking the camera may be defective.  No chance to follow up on that yet, as we just got back.I had a scare:  the pictures viewed on the LCD screen had an out of focus look.  I worried that all her pictures might be bad.  But the good news is that after downloading to the computer, her shots, viewed on my 17\" monitor,  are tack sharp!  A fine lens!  There were only 2 or 3 unsharp shots out of 579 total, and they are probably ther result of operator error.I can also say I'm very favorably impressed with the Canon's color management.  Good, satisfying color that does not disappoint.I don't think the dynamic range from highlight to shadows is very great.  The camera, in the hands of an amateur with no time to learn photography, produced quite  few blown highlights on scenes that ranged from shadow to bright sky areas, and definitely favors the shadows, which remain readable at the expense of blown highlights.  Probably an exposure tweak toward the underexposure side would help things a lot.  Of course, almost all digitals are limited in this regard; point-and-shoots perhaps more so than DSLRs.So, summing up:Image quality:  Excellent, for such a small camera.Color management:  Very good.Exposure latitude:  could be better.Ease of use:  pretty good!Battery life:  A big problem with our sample.  We may or may not have a defective sample, and this needs to be followed up on.

I shoot 3D images by using two of these at a time.  The A590IS has an optically stabliized image that is very useful in low light or when the camera is zoomed in at 4X.  The display is sufficient to preview the composition in full sunlight, but the optical viewfinder is also a fine feature to have.Rechargable AA battereis last about 200 shots or more and the display may be turned off to increase this.  However the display does not seem to draw so much power that this is worth doing.  The AA battereis make this camera larger than some other Canons, but I prefer the AAs due to their general availabity when on vacation.  One set of lithium batteries may be used to fill an 8gig card without replacement.The graphite fiber plastic body is more robust than the metal body used in the A570ISs that I also have that tends to show dents from heavy use.The only feature that could be improved upon with this camera is the focal length of the zoom lens.  I would also recommed the SX110 that I purchased for its 10x zoom lens.The video fuction of this camera is also great, and better than video cameras in that it isa full 640x480 at 30 frames per second.  Normal video cameras are not as good for viewing on the computer due to \"interlacing\" that prevents fozen images from being sharp.The Canon A590IS is a very good value.", "Date": "January 30,

I didn't realize how washed out the background colors seemed to be with my other camera, it never captured the real light! This camera does! I love it, it takes great pictures, they are life like pictures and when looking at a picture I just took on the screen and looking up at what I took the pic of, they look exactly the same. I love this camera, and I'm so glad I got it!EDITAfter using this camera for a while I have noticed one MAJOR and ANNOYING flaw. It takes FOREVER to take pictures, and to recoop from the last picture. I have a fast SD card so I don't think it is the picture writing that slows it. It takes sometimes up to 6 seconds to take a second picture which is not helpful if you have a baby or a toddler who can't or won't hold a pose, or to get candid shots. I absolutely hate this camera and will probably never buy a cannon again.

I purchased it a few days before a trip to California, which means I didn't have all that much time to get acquainted with the device.I had absolutely no problems learning how to use the camera and taking good pictures with it. To my amateurish eyes, the pictures came out just fine and the camera was quite easy to use. There are a variety of settings you can use depending on what is being photographed and when: People, landscapes, action shots, nighttime shots, the \"easy mode\" etc. These are all nicely indicated using a graphic that appears on the LCD screen. For example, the portrait feature is indicated by a small graphic of a person's profile. There's also a video mode that can be fun.The camera is pretty compact--not as small as some models out there, but I had no problems. One feature the camera includes that I think is quite important is a view finder in addition to the LCD screen. In bright sunlight it is difficult to take a photo using the LCD screen. I found myself using the viewfinder most of the time. I would caution anyone purchasing a camera with only an LCD screen. This was actually pointed out to me by a colleague who is experienced with digital cameras.The camera also comes equipped with \"image stabilizer\" and  \"face recognition\" features; from what I understand, these are two important features you should look for in a digital camera.For basic photography (vacation pictures, family events, etc.) this is a fine camera at a reasonable price. Part of my research consisted of using Consumer Reports, and the magazine gave Canon products (not sure if this particular model was reviewed) a \"Best Buy \" rating.About the only caveat I have is that the program included to load your picture on your computer is not particularly user-friendly. I wound up using iPhotos instead since I have a Mac.

This may not be a problem if the purchaser is the only one using this camera, but give it to a complete stranger to take a picture of you and the wife in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and you are going to end up with a picture that will probably be out of focus.

I have a Konica Minolta Dimage Z20, 5 megapixels and 8X optical.  I love that camera but it's too bulky to take everywhere.  It doesn't have the image stabilizer but it seems to take clearer pictures than the Canon does.

It was dropped one too many times and gave up. I would rate that camera as a 5 star (non professional) camera as a comparison.I did not want to spend a lot and the reviews and price on this camera were good. I have had it for a couple months and have been pleased. The pictures, for the most part, turn our very nice. There are many options for picture taking ie...kids&pets;, portrait, action, etc. and other setting to play with if you know what they mean or do. I mostly keep it on auto. Low light picture taking is difficult. The flash is VERY bright so if you want mood lighting (taking a pic of kids blowing out candles) you are out of luck! The flash tends to wash things out, especially if you are a little close. The contrast in pictures is something I regularly have to fix with photo editing software. I sometimes also have to fix the definition as pictures sometimes come out soft. I have had an issue with odd reddish shadows once in a while but I'm not sure why. Zooming in on things makes them a bit grainy. The video feature is great! You would not want to use the camera as a video camera but if you need to catch that spontaneous moment, it will do.The camera itself seems sturdy. The rubbery plastic door that closes over the USB port is the only part I'm concerned about breaking. For a small camera it is pretty heavy. If you want something to slip into your jeans this is probably not the right camera. It is perfect for a small purse though. It is small in length and height but it is pretty wide because of the battery compartment.For the price, and as an everyday camera, I am very happy.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "overall great little camera", "Author": "C.

The replacement camera took about a half dozen people trying before the lens ring would budge. And it is still very difficult to get off.

As for the flash issue that people keep reporting about. I don't understand how people expect normal cheap alkalines to be adequate. If you want the batteries to last anytime at all and have a reasonable flash recharge you have to have HIGH capacity rechargeable NiMH batteries in the range of 2400mah. If you do that you will find this camera a pleasure. If you try to cheap out and get by on the crummy alkalines from the drugstore this camera is going to be MISERABLE.Please do yourself a favor and spend about $20 on a nice set of decent high capacity rechargables and a charger and its advisable to have at least four batteries that way you have an extra set of rechargables in your camera bag at all times. I did this on a trip to India with the A570 and with those high capacity batteries and the extra set on hand I never had problems with flash recharge time.Otherwise, this is an excellent camera.

In 2002 I bought an Olympus C-3040 for $540.  I like the Olympus very much and it takes great photos, but the SmartMedia 128MB maximum began to wear on me.I bought the A590 after doing A LOT of research.  I was originally going to buy one of the more compact Olympus or Nikon models, but I really wasn't too thrilled about the idea of proprietary batteries, even if they do contribute to a slimmer camera shell.  I have quite a few Energizer AA rechargeables and a 15 minute charger that gets me up and running for weeks or even months at a time on one charge.  Always easy to find AA's no matter where you're at too.I've been playing around with the A590 for a few weeks now and I am impressed with the picture quality.  I still feel that the Olympus takes consistently better pictures, but it was originally over three times the price, is much bulkier, has major media limitations, and a significantly smaller LCD.  I have tried a number of different settings on the A590 to find what produces the best picture, and I've concluded that I like the \"P\" mode the best with Auto ISO, Auto White Balance, the max sharpness setting in the \"My Colors\" setting to offset Canon's inherently smoothed out pictures, 8 megapixels, Evaluative mode, and Superfine.  Also, center focus generally produces the most pleasing pics for me, unless I'm taking portraits.  I've read some reviews that indicate that 8 megapixels is too high of setting for a camera with this size sensor, but I've compared identical photos I've taken with all of the different resolution settings and the 8 megapixel setting does show more detail at the same zoomed out view as the other resolutions.  You particularly notice it with objects that have a lot of detail, such as an oriental rug or a bush in the yard that has a large number of leaves.  With my Panasonic 2GB card, I can take over 550 pics with those settings, more than enough between downloads to the computer.  I'm also very pleased with the videos this camera takes, which my 2GB card maxes out at approximately 25 minutes in length.  Canon dropped the fps from 30 to 20 on this year's model, but it still looks very good for a digicam video.  The audio pickup is impressive as well.I'd like to stress again the importance, in my opinion, of setting the sharpness (under My Colors setting) to the maximum setting if anyone is not initially impressed with the quality of the pics.  When comparing pics to my Olympus 3040, I felt that they were soft and too smooth.  Then I read online that Canon pics have a trademark smoothness to them, which caused me to figure out how to adjust the sharpness to compensate for this, given that I prefer a sharper, more detailed photo.  Since adjusting the sharpness, I'm much happier.  Once you set it, it will remain at the maximum even after cycling the power.Overall, for the price I've paid I'm happy with the camera and would recommend it to anyone looking at a digital camera in the $125-200 price range.

The auto-focus, facial recognition, and adjustment features all respond quickly at half-depress... lining up a great shot is simple and quick.- \"Manual\" mode gives you reign over everything about the photo, from the white balance, to the aperture, flash output, and even the part of the screen it uses to calculate gamma compensation.  When you've got time to make the picture turn out just right, this little camera won't disappoint.- The lens isn't half bad either, giving you focus-adjustment down to 2 inches from the end of the lens, and incremental up to 10 feet.As with most new Digital Cameras, the viewfinder has been long-since replaced by the back LCD, which provides a helpful and adjustable HUD.  The color spectral graphs are especially nice to have on-hand if you're worried about balancing multiple shots against each other.The only cons are inherent in the design:  the viewfinder and flash are almost useless when the camera is fitted with an optional lens hood / adapter.

I used to have an older Canon and thought I would give them a try again, and I have to say I am rather pleased with my purchase.  The camera turns on and is ready to take picutres quickly.  The Auto mode is great for most daylight or well lit settings. The 'Night-Scene' Mode works great if you are taking picutres during the night or in a dim room.  Colors are vibrant and crisp, and the image stabilization works rather well when using the zoom.  I really like all the available customization options for Exposure and and White Balance, that helps if you know a bit about what you are doing and want to take some specialized shots, which is exactly what I was looking for.I only have one thing that I don't like so far about the camera.  I would have liked something more then just a 4x Optical Zoom.  A 6x or 8x would have been a lot nicer, although you can purchase additional lenses for this, which is a great option.

I didn't expect the two AA batteries or the SD card that came with it to be anything spectacular.  They weren't.  Replaced the card with a 1gb eFilm PRO SD card and solved that problem.  But the batteries -- After the supplied batteries quickly died, I replaced them with a pair of 2300 mAh Lenmar rechargables - fully charged.  I expected to be off and running with a reasonable amount of battery life on hand.  Not so.  That wretched little, red low battery flashing icon came on in less than two hours of non-constant camera use.  Two additional, freshly charged, batteries had the same result.  I'm thinking this may be partially my fault as I did use the LED screen and flash about half that time.  But I really do think I should have gotten more use from these batteries.  So, I have purchased a pack of four Sanyo NiMH, Eneloop batteries and await their arrival.  I did a lot of research on which batteries to purchase and try, and these seem to come out on top. It is claimed these particular batteries don't leak juice, just sitting there, the way others will. I have a Nikon dSLR and a Canon SD870IS and I'm just not used to low battery life.  I wish this a590IS had the same type of battery that's in the 870. Perhaps I see the need to change the approach I have of tending to battery life with my use of the a590 camera.  I've shut the LED off (on the 590) except for a few seconds of post-view after a shot.  I have to use the LED to compose with the 870IS, but won't with the a590.  I also find that the 590 gives me a \"softer\" print than the 870, but I can live with this.  I really only want the a590 as a camera that can travel with me that I dont have to worry about.  But, it would be nice to get some mileage out of it if I'm along the coast of Maine, or some such place for the day where it would get a good amount of use.  I do really like this a590IS, but give it only three stars because I have no confidence in it's ability to last a reasonable amount of time.  It hasn't done that yet.  Perhaps the new batteries and my new approach (which I don't really think I should have to take) will make a difference here.  I'll edit this whole thing if that's my experience after a reasonable amount of time.  Maybe I should have gotten the updated Canon SD880IS and use 870IS as my travel companion. That would have been a great idea, but the 870IS is too expensive for the casual attitude I could have with the a590.  Again, I do like the a590, but it does chew up the batteries - at least for me.  I hope that changes.  If it does, I'll report that.  Until then. . . ._______________________Well, It's been almost two months since the above post.  A very helpful person replied and suggested a stronger battery - but, please read on: The four Sanyo Eneloop batteries arrived and I purchased four 8X Energizer Lithium batteries (+/- $11 for either 4 pack).  I took two of the Eneloops right out of the pack and put them in the camera.  It's well over 200 shots later now and the Eneloops appear to be still going strong.  I have become a believer in the Eneloops and now have the confidence in the A590IS that caused me to give the camera only three stars earlier.  I have two of the 8X Energizer lithium batteries in the camera case for when the Eneloops need to be replaced, only to be recharged.  The 8X Energizers are not rechargable.  I have since purchased four additional Eneloops along with the charger for these batteries.  Around $15, on sale, at Amazon.  The Eneloops (and, possibly the Energizers) will eventually replace, and become my only AA battery.  The Sanyo Eneloop batteries are only 2000 mAh, but they don't loose their charge the way other rechargables will while just sitting there.  I don't seem to need anything more than this 2000 mAh rateing.  If I could change the star rate of the A590IS, it would be to four stars.  Not five because I would like to see a wider field of view at that end, and I do find that sunlight in back of me does diminish the LED effectivness - but the optical viewfinder is there for those occasions.  I suppose the camera would be more expensive if it overcame these two points. So, it was the batteries all along.  Sanyo Eneloops solved this and I expect the 8X Energizer lithiums will be good also.  I would report on the Energizers, but the Sanyo product doesn't seem to want to give up so I can try the lithiums.  Just a moment to say that I keep the camera on aperature priority or progrm so I can keep the ISO at 200 (manually set), or below.  Others have complained about noise, but I haven't seen any at these ISO settings.

After spending several hours looking and reading reviews, I picked the Cannon A590IS. The things I liked about the camera when I first saw it, was the shape. I don't like those real small flat ones. They are great to stick in your shirt pocket, but are hard to hold steady and shoot. This one had a nice handle like grip where the batteries fit in and you can hold it and shoot with one  hand if you want to. It's still small enough to fit into a coat pocket, purse and pants pocket. It had great reviews and the price was great.I sure wasn't disappointed when I got it and got a chance to use it. It was everything people were saying it was. Easy to figure out, took great pictures and had a good zoom.I wanted a camera that used AA batteries, which you can find anywhere if your batteries die on you. The Cannon had that too. But it had something my Kodak didn't have and that was a view finder. Not many cameras have a view finder anymore. It really comes in handy when the sun is bright and washes out your LCD screen.But I soon discovered another great use for it. The view finder can stretch the life of your batteries a long way. On many shots, I turn the screen off and shoot using the view finder. The screen will light up for a second or two and show me what I shot and turn off again. That really is a great battery saver if used and would take care of most of the complaints about this camera.There are so many features on this camera, both automatic and adjustable that it's hard to believe it sells for so little. It should satisfy the needs of about anyone, novice or skilled camera user.A good safety feature you can use, is when putting your camera away, put the switch in (review) mode and not in (shoot)mode. That way if it accidentally gets turned on, the lens won't open up and push against what ever you put it in with and mess up the lens.I liked this camera so much, I just ordered two more. One for my other Daughter and one for my Son. They should get them this week and I'm sure they will love it as much as I do.If your looking for a good point and shoot camera with most of the bells and whistles on it and small enough to put in your pocket, but big enough to get a good grip on it, you can't go wrong with this camera.

A teacher of photography in our high school taught her classes using the A590 so I had a long talk with her and asked her why she chose that particular camera to use. She had 24 A590 cameras to teach her students with. She told me that this camera was totally auto BUT it was also fully manual, and she could teach her students photography best in manual mode. That peaked my interest. Every digital camera today will take the perfect picture, but sometimes that's not what I want, I like to be creative, and I understand light & shadow.

I mainly wanted a camera with image stabilizer with decent zoom. I mainly use it for everyday pics and for concert settings. I needed something that does well in lowlight settings. With flash I'd say 80% of the pics are very clear in a lowlight setting. Without flash I'd say it drops down to about 60%. The video is decent. There is some noise when taking video at such a place as a concert. Especially when watching on the camera itself. On a computer the video sounds much better and the picture quality is pretty clear. But don't try zooming while shooting the video. It will blur the picture. Also I find sometimes the video will blur while taking even not zooming. It's really a 50/50 shot.The zoom is pretty good. I can be about halfway back in a concert crowd in a small venue and still get good pics. But don't try going beyond the 4x zoom into digital. It will blur the farther off the 4x you go.I love the big LCD screen, definitely a huge plus.Love the AA battery. I hate non standard batteries. I've had friends who their cameras have run out of battery life in the middle of a concert. So replaceable batteries are a must. I guess it really doesn't have good battery life. I can't give an estimate but I probably had to change the batteries at least once during a concert (which includes taking pictures earlier in the day as it's usually a road trip to the show). But it never really bothered me. I just carried a couple extra spares.I can't comment on the different settings, as I only ever used auto and video modes. They worked well enough for me.The flash will take a minute to recharge between pics. This can be annoying, especially at a concert (or I would assume when trying to capture children). You have to hold the flash down for a couple seconds before it takes the pic. Between pics also takes a couple seconds. The screen will go black until it's ready for the next pic.The camera is a nice size. Not huge and bulky, but not very small either. For me it's a perfect size. I will miss this camera as it's served it's purpose quite well for my average uses.A couple problems I've had. I'd say a little over 2 years or so after I bought it the battery compartment wouldn't shut all the way. I had to put a hairband around it to keep the battery compartment closed. But it still didn't close completely, resulting in a low battery warning all the time. Finally, my camera has hit its end. It will no longer even stay on for more than a couple minutes. Even with fully charged batteries. and just about a week ago my flash stopped working. I must admit I am hard on cameras. This one has been in my purse, in my pocket at shows, has been dropped, etc. So for the abuse it has taken I think it's lasted a good length of time.Honestly for the price, I wouldn't buy it. I got mine for $160 four years ago at a local retail store. It was on sale at the time and was originally $250. I can't believe how much the price is now for such an old model. I really wouldn't spend the money and buying a used one would be just as bad, as with my experience the more it's used the less it'll last and you'll end up having to buy another camera a year or 2 later.If you can find it new for no more than $180 then I'd say that's a decent deal.

Great battery life with those special Energizer AAs made for electronics.  I never had any issues like some other reviews have mentioned.  Picture quality was great in general, and particularly so for its size and ease of use.  I don't remember having any complaints about this camera.After nearly a year of making do without the 590, I finally decided on replacement camera.  I chose a Canon SX40IS (which I love) for my 'big' camera, and recently picked up a Canon A3300IS as my new go-anywhere camera.  The A3300 I do not love.  In fact, I went back to the store and bought a Panasonic FH25 for a side-by-side comparison.  I generally like the Panasonic and, as is to be expected, its fancy features are much improved over the A590IS. (Oh, and it's purple!)  But in comparing pictures at 100% resolution, I see very little difference between my supposed 16MP Panasonic and my 8MP 590IS.  The A3300IS (also a supposed 16MP) is even less impressive than the Panasonic.  I know it's not all about the megapixels but for a jump from 8 to 16, I really expected better - especially from another PowerShot.  For the $150-ish price point, I'm not sure the newer Canon point-and-shoots really have anything on the 590 other than fancy features of dubious photographic value.  Photo-quality seems to be equal, if not less than the 590.After spending an evening hemming and hawing and deciding which (if either) camera to keep, I decided on the Panasonic.  Those neat little features may be largely useless but once I'd seen that I could have them in both my 'big' camera and my P&S;, they were hard to resist.  (And did I mention that it's purple?)  But I also hopped on Ebay and picked up a used 590IS 'just in case'.  There are some trips that simply must result in memories preserved 'on film' and you don't want to be caught with a camera glitch, or stuck with proprietary batteries you can't charge or replace at a moment's notice.  The 590IS will mostly be for my daughter's use, as she's developing an interest in photography, but I also plan to make sure she brings it along whenever we set off on one of those 'not to be missed' trips.  The bottom line for me is that there are certainly some neat little cameras that have come out in the last few years and I'm enjoying the new features that they offer.

The red battery warning symbol still sometimes appears almost immediately, but can often be made to go away by sliding the battery hatch open and closed a few times, reinforcing other owners' claims of a problem with the contacts.As a result, I'm still not confident about taking the camera out for the day, without the worry of it dying on me unexpectedly.After reading many comments online, my conclusion is that the A590is is a relatively power-hungry camera, that's made worse by an overly-fussy battery sensor and poorly-designed battery contacts.It's a real shame that a camera capable of taking such beautifully-clear, well-exposed and natural-looking photographs renders itself unusable because of its high, or perceived high, battery consumption.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unbeatable learning camera", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R3L9JMD05PLYOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my daughter, so she could have fun taking pictures but also learn the fundamentals of taking excellent pictures.

The price history for this excellent performing point and shoot is quite remarkable.  The camera debuted early in 2008 at around $200, and over time dropped down to around the $110 level.  However the price rebounded and increased to stratospheric levels.  The highest price I observed, was about $350 for a brand new model.I have had this camera for over a year, and have been completely satisfied with its performance.  I paid $140, and was tempted to buy another when the price was $110.  This camera is with me most of the time, and I have taken many thousands of images, with a `keeper' rate above 90%.  I have used it to shoot almost anything, except for fast moving subjects or sports.  Subjects have included, casual everyday moments, images for work, special events, family gatherings, my dog, and vacation memories.As an avid user of Canon SLR's, I had been disappointed with the previous A series Powershot cameras I owned.  The images did not have great colors, the zoom mechanism was clunky, the shutter delay was annoying, and it took a while to write to the memory card.  All this changed with the A590IS.  Color rendition is excellent, and the white balance settings work very well.  The camera is not suitable for shooting action sports, but the autofocus is very reliable in most situations, including low light or at night.  Shutter delay is minimal.  If you use flash at high ISO, it does take a while to write to the card, but otherwise time delay between shots is minimal.  The zoom action is not the greatest, but it is much improved, and more responsive.  The camera also shoots pretty good quality movies, with decent sound.The A59IS has a heavy duty, metallic gray, wear resistant housing, that is thick, providing for an excellent grip.  The camera accepts HDSC cards, so you can take thousands of images, or shoot some pretty long movies.  Battery life is good, using AA sized NiMH batteries.  The 2.5\" display is substantial, and the flash pretty powerful.  Like any camera, the controls take some getting used to, but the design is similar to other Powershots, and not too complicated.  Shooting mode is selected using the dial on the top of the camera.  Program Mode (P) works fine for me most of the time.  The size could be an issue for some, as the camera is a little bulky to slip in a pocket, but overall this is a very solid performing point and shoot.Is the A590IS worth paying a premium price?  Although I am very happy with mine, the camera has been on the market for almost two years!  Newer cameras probably offer more features and better performance, for the same money.  As good as the A590IS is, I am on the lookout for a smaller camera to replace it someday.

I have had more blurred pictures with this camera in three weeks than I had in the entire period of my ownership of the other two cameras.  The viewfinder, a good feature not available in many new point-and-shoot cameras, is unreliable in terms of coverage; I never had this issue in either of the earlier Canon iterations.  The color is spotty. The battery life is terrible.  The motion pictures, at higher resolutions, are only 20 fps, rather than 30 in the older camras.

With $100 tag, i was never expect this such of quality, features and ability. I was actually waiting for my decision whether getting G10, LX3, or SD990 (more compact) .. all of those has manuals to control. Then i heard that Fuji has new sensor coming, and so the waiting process extended (cos i need camera good for concert : low light, and i'm curious of what fuji would bring to the table this time). I know that i'm not gonna make any decision in this few months and so i purchased this hundred bucks camera cos it has manuals.And i was very happy i bought this one as a tweener as i need to have smaller camera at the moment (i have sony dsc-h5 which i love so much but cannot slip to my pocket), and believe it or not it fits my skinny jeans pocket, just need a little extra slip then it's good (though it will make a little bump on your pocket more than smaller compact, but still fits comfortably as long as you don't sit with it inside your pocket).The manual control is amazing in this camera. You can control aperture shutter, exposure, flash level (i love this one!), and manual focus (and this one also). Amazingly, the pics i took with this camera looks really great .. not great great but .. REALLY GREAT! I've had SD1000 before and the pics looked horrible! Noise and unacceptable noise in every inch of the pictures when i crop it 100%, grainy and it doesn't have ability of taking pic indoor (at least that's my experience .. on lots of occasions, enough for me to give conclusion that it's more like a toy, anyway i loved the shape a lot!).Never liked the shape of A series until now, it feels more secure in my hand, and it's not as big as i was expected (in a good way), i still consider it small (look at G9 or A650, now that's big! .. for pocket) and some people complains about battery life, i don't have that problem since i charge my eneloop batteries right.Cos :- Constructions, plastic all around. I bet that's why canon made this very affordable, yet the quality of the camera exceeds other compacts in it's class (our advantage in my opinion, to fight the price), though i'd prefer rugged material for me i have no problem, since i found the plastic body is quite cute and pretty as long as you don't let it fall. Not a problem.- Video quality is to be honest .. ugly (20fps)! Mic is pretty good except the picture .. even only play it on my computer. Then when i plug it to my hdtv and tube tv .. DISASTER! don't expect any quality video out of this camera. But since i'm not into video anyway so .. Not a problem- Slow flash recycle when you set it on full/strongest level. But i'm using manual setting, and set the flash output to the lowest most of the time, so the recycle time is not that slow (about 2 or 3 seconds total after each snaps, and remember .. that after each snap we will have a preview of what we just took, so for me, i didn't feel like i was waiting). But if you're into action picture with flash, don't complain .. just don't buy this camera cos this camera is fully loaded for it's price! I see the reason people had a it very very slow because most of them are using Auto mode, which is using the max flash output most of the time, causing the flash recycle to be very slow, i mean REALLY SLOW like about 10 seconds total including preview. While the medium takes about 5 seconds total (hey i just counted it by my sense, didn't do the exact timing with stop watch, sorry if i'm not that accurate, that's why i typed : ..about)- Auto mode is horrible! get ready to be washed out by the flash and very often set to high ISO automatically. But i found out that the easy mode works way better for this purpose. So take easy mode instead i you need to take a quick snap.- I wish this one has the famous canon's color accent, but it's doesn't !Now this one is a problem for me cos i loved it, shoot!- LCD resolution is a little low. Not that good. It's become a problem for me sometimes since i use manual focus very often, so it's a bit difficult to see whether it's focused or not cos the pic on LCD isn't sharp and that clear (doesn't affect the result at all if you got it right, it's just the LCD). A little bugger on this one.Well overall i am very very happy to have this camera. Heck ! for 100 bucks i buried all the cons far away of my thoughts cos the pros outweighs everything. Glad i didn't get other budget class camera, cos though it's the same price range (under $200) it's gonna be lower class instead of this one.Oh yeah, i've always put something in front of the flash as a diffuser so i don't have a harsh flash light (but this camera has great flash anyway, you'll be okay without anything, just set the level and watch for the distance) i even stick the toilet paper (this one was the best) on the clear tape and stick it on the flash. But now i have a better and dedicated flash diffuser for point and shoot camera that spreads out the light evenly and  nicely without giving a harsh spot flash light causing the washed out picture. Especially for portrait pics. I have attached some pictures of it, so check it out!Now i can see what's the hype about canon's. But as long as you able to control your camera of what it could brings to the picture and not the other way around, any camera with a decent quality would be fine. Depends on what your needs, any brands has their good and bad ones (i love my SONY DSC-H5, but i hate my nikon P5100's pic quality). Don't let biased people become a judge to your decision.Give this cute little camera a chance, i bet you're gonna love of what you spend!

The camera actually focuses on your subject and takes ultra clear, gorgeous pictures. It has a nice place to hold it, so it feels secure in your hand. Lots and lots of features to take pictures, more than I'll ever use. Great options to go completely manual and a combination of manual/automatic. I've used the \"snow\" scene option quite a lot and the pictures come out great.One drawback is there is no internal memory, so you have to have a memory card; which is stored in the same space as the battery. Not a big deal for me, but some complained about it. I purchased a 4GB card, as you do have the option to take large picture files.Compared to the Kodak this camera feels more sturdy and better construction. Some complained of a flimsy feeling construction, but I don't find that. This camera also has the option of interchangeable lenses, but you first need to buy an \"adapter\" and then the lens. I probably won't do that as that will cost even more than the camera!Some complained about short battery life. It doesn't seem much different from the Kodak I had and I just replaced the batteries from the original after having it for a month.

My main use for the camera was to take pictures of faces, groups of people, places, and business images for posting on my website [...]  Example pictures would be office buildings, conference rooms with chairs, people working at laptops etc.  This camera is so easy to use and has so many features that I don't think I can include all of them here so I'll focus on only my top favorites.AA Battery Power#1  favorite feature of the Canon PowerShot A590 is that it uses AA batteries.  What that means is that I (or you) don't have to stop and plug the camera into a wall outlet and wait for the battery to recharge.  No, I can simply carry a few extra AA batteries in my camera case and if I find myself taking 200 or more pictures in one afternoon, I can just replace the batteries and continue taking pictures.  The camera warns you of a low battery power situation with an indicator located on the display.  If you don't want to keep buying AA batteries, you can use rechargeable AA batteries and keep an extra, fully charged set of those batteries in your camera bag, handbag, or backpack.Large 2.5 inch LCD Screen#2 favorite feature is the large 2.5-inch LCD screen with face detection technology and red eye correction.  The display is very big.  You can easily see what you want to photograph without having to squint your eyes.  The image is clear and bright.  If you are taking a picture of a person's face, you can clearly see whether or not the person is ready and the picture will be good or if you have to give him/her some coaching to get a good facial expression.  (eyes open, etc)  You can make the camera focus on a certain face in a group or an object by pressing the picture button down only half way and looking in the display.  You will see a square appear around the face/object and if that's what you want the camera to focus on then you press the button down all the way to snap the picture. The camera has three options to fix red-eye but as of yet, I have not had any pictures which came out with a red-eye issue.No Blurry Pictures#3 favorite feature is the 4x optical image stabilized zoom.  What this means is the camera has a technology that will keep your pictures from coming out blurry even if you move your hands a little or your subject moves a little bit.  So far, I have not had any pictures with a blurry image.Easy Downloading and Printing#4 favorite feature and maybe the best.  Easy printing - this camera features a Print/Share button for easy direct printing to a printer or downloading to your computer.So to download your pictures from the camera to your computer or laptop, just connect the USB cable to your camera and connect the other end to your computer's USB connection (any of them). Once it's connected and your camera is ON and in the picture review mode, whatever picture software you have installed on your computer will open automatically.  Next, you'll select the menu choice to \"download\" the pictures to your computer.  (I use Adobe software for digital photos.)  When the pictures are downloaded to your picture directory, you'll see a new folder added with the current date.  You can delete the pictures from your Canon camera after they've finished downloading by either choosing the \"delete\" menu option in your picture software program or by using the menu button on the back of the camera itself.  The menu button is easy to see on the back of the camera and is the starting point for pretty much any feature you are interested in using.  Just press the menu button and then use the \"func set\" button to scroll down the menu list which you'll see on the LCD display.To sum up my thoughts about the Canon PowerShot A590 IS camera, I would have to say it's very easy to use, takes great pictures, and is very inexpensive.

(And also purchased some rechargeable batteries and a recharger). It is not a pocket size, but it is pretty small.It seems to take fine pictures for her purposes. With a short hands-on experience, she is comfortable with it. Despite a little arthritis in her hands, she can open the battery/SD card compartment to change batteries or take the card out for reading on her computer. We chose it because it had a view finder as well as the screen. (I appreciate using the viewfinder when I don't have my reading glasses handy since then I can't focus well on any 'screen'. I imagined that the same would apply for my mother).It can be a little slow in taking pictures, but from our experience with another model, that will be alleviated when we get a fast (class 6) SDHC card for her. It came with a 512MB card that was nothing special. It would be sensible to upgrade that as soon as possible with something like a 4 or 8GB class 6 card and high speed card reader.The only thing I do not like (perhaps I just didn't read the manual carefully enough to figure it out) is I cannot change the stored image names to a more unique and identifiable naming scheme that uses the date in the name.

My first review, but I am so very happy with this camera.  I bought it as a replacement for a Kodak DX7630 6.1MP I bought 4 years ago.  The price I got this camera for here of $109.99, is by far the least expensive I've seen.  It is only 1/3 the price of my old camera and by far superior.Some points...1) Takes great shots, and with being able to adjust every setting, including focus, if auto or easy mode for some reason didn't get it, then you could.2)Movie modes.  Many to choose from.  The smallest is super for e-mail.  The largest although running better than a Meg a second is awesome, even at 20 FPS. I think it takes better movies, definitely in low light, then my digital camcorder.3) The only negative I could mention is that in the highest fine picture mode (which is not the default), the processing time between shots can be long.  Sometimes even 5-7 seconds. However, its default mode is superb.  I just figure finer is better, since I downsize pics and so want to start with the most picture info.  The time lag doesn't bother me.  If I needed rapid shots, I'd switch modes, or use burst.4) It uses 2 AA batteries.  I put rechargeables in it.  They have never run out on me.  However, I always recharge after every large usage occasion.5) I just got this at Christmas and haven't even gotten through the manual yet.  It does so much and I'm always discovering more.6) For example..my son had a concert.  I was way in the back.  From my seat, to him on the stage, only the stage lit, with full digital zoom going (16x), it captured a more then usable shot.  I was amazed!7) So bottom line...I love it!  Even if it was $150 it would have been worth it.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "H. Bailey", "ReviewID": "R34XMMCVLQ5VSK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Plenty of features in a compact design, a great camera for beginning and intermediate photographers. The camera isn't quite a shirt-pocket camera, but small enough to be easily carried.The 2.5\" LCD is bright and crisp. The only issue with the LCD is the 'noise' in low light conditions or when using the digital zoom. The noise is filtered out of the picture, but is still visible in the LCD.The red-eye reduction feature is buried in the menu system, which makes it difficult to easily turn on or off, but the function can be assigned to the print button for one-touch access. The red-eye reduction feature works extremely well compared to older generation cameras. A lamp is used prior to exposure to reduce red-eye and any red-eye you may get is removed during processing.The various shooting modes are great when used as intended. The action shot (high speed shutter) was available on older Canon models, but is missing on this model. I have yet to blur an action shot, but I've only taken action shots in bright sunlight. If you need a faster shutter in low light conditions, it can be manually adjusted in the Tv mode. Once again, plenty of features, and plenty of manual adjustments for the creative photographer.If you intend on shooting 8MP photos, invest in a good SDHC Class 4 or better memory card. The SDHC cards have faster transfer rates than standard SD cards. The class rating on SDHC cards indicates the minimum write speed in MB/Sec. A class 4 SDHC card will write an 8MP photo to memory in slightly less than 1 second. A faster write means you're ready for the next shot sooner.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great value for the money", "Author": "T2000KW", "ReviewID": "R16MGP46DM4J0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll leave the detailed feature reviews for those who have the time to write for free, but this camera is a great value for the money. It has aperture priority and shutter speed priority settings, as well as a host of scene modes that shift the white balance to the lighting for various scenes. There's even an aquarium mode, which I've tested and found to be very useful.There are so many features that one might feel overwhelmed, but you can start taking pictures immediately with the easy mode or the auto mode and let the camera take care of things for you. You can disable flash in all modes, so if you are using easy mode in a museum where you aren't permitted to take flash pictures, you can turn it off.Battery life is much better than the last camera I had (a Fuji Finepix 1300), and it takes 1/2 as many batteries (2 versus 4) also. I use the Duracell 2650 ma/hr rechargeable NiMH batteries, the highest capacity I could find locally, and keep 2 spares freshly charged. I haven't tried this camera on alkaline batteries but I would expect shorter battery life, though probably better than in most cameras.Zoom works well. It stops at 4x optical when you zoom but it can go further with digital zoom (with some picture degradation, of course), up to 16x. I like the fact that it stops you from going beyond the maximum optical zoom before you enter the digital zoom, and beyond 4x it changes the magnification factor number to blue characters, so 5.5x would be blue, to warn you that you are beyond the optical zoom's capabilities. It's easy to mute the camera when you turn it on if you need to be quiet when you take a snapshot, as in some nature photography. You just have to hold one button on while you turn the camera on and it puts it in mute mode so the camera doesn't beep every time you push a button to change some setting.Great camera, great price at $109, and you can find it in the Amazon Marketplace for about $10 less right now from Adorama Camera as a refurbished unit if you don't mind that. I would have bought one of those refurbs from them but at the time there were none for sale below $109 anywhere else.If you need more features and greater zoom range, consider the 10x model, but this one got the greatest overall reviews everywhere (not just on Amazon) and that was a major decider for me.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very nice macro capability", "Author": "M.

My DSLR is just to bulky to carry with me and too expensive to just leave laying around.  This camera meets my needs perfectly as it is compact and is one of the few Canon point and shoots that allows you to control exposure by aperture, shutter speed or manually.  This is handy when in difficult light situations, portraiture, and especially in landscape shooting.  Although the ability to use a histogram (a graph that tells you about the details of exposure) may not be used by many folks in everyday photography, it is available on this camera.The viewfinder allows you to hold the camera up to your face instead of having use the LCD screen by holding the camera away from you.  This allows you to hold the camera steadier and makes it easier to use the zoom controls.  I find it unbelievable that so few point and shoots have this what I consider to be necessary feature.  The view finder adjusts as you zoom the lens so you can see what you are shooting.When you have too many megapixels in a small camera, you really don't gain anything useful, but you do loose picture quality, especially color quality.  This camera is just about right in that you should be able to make about a 16x20 inch print (or do some cropping)while still have good sharpness and quality.  The picture, compared to the 10 or more megapixel cameras, has bright colors and good sharpness.The shape has a nice feel to it and it fits in my hand nicely.  The controls are easy to get to and the menus are fairly intuitive.Since I carry it in my brief case, I first used it at an office party and the pictures came out great.  The 8X10 group portrait was sharp with good colors and contrast.  Canon makes a great camera and this one is no exception.  What I don't understand is why it is so inexpensive compared with others in its class, yet has so many features.

I never really looked at the instruction book -- since this is my third digital camera (I have an older Sony and a much older Nikon). I originally wanted to buy another Nikon because I liked my older Nikon Coolpix, it was so easy to use and took great pictures -- but some poor reviews kept me from buying another Nikon this time. I was swayed into buying the Canon by the good reviews I read.With that said, I am very pleased with my Canon (so far). The photos I took of scenic landscapes came out great. But, this is not the true test of the camera, in my opinion -- since all the digital cameras I have owned did great on landscapes. What I was after was the elimination of those blurry shots I used to take with the older cameras. This is where the image stabilization comes into play. I am very pleased with this aspect of the new camera. I have very few fuzzy photos this time around.Also, I have a one year old grandson who is the target of lots of my photographs. He is part of the reason I decided to buy a new camera with the Image Stabilization feature. With the new Canon I am capturing him in motion with a lot less blur. Although, I do agree with other reviewers on the long delay between shots when the flash is used. To get around this problem, I try to go outdoors for photo sessions with him -- or at least stay near a window with natural light. I will often turn the flash off so it doesn't fire automatically.I took some great night shots in Bar Harbor with the camera while I was on vacation. Also, the macro setting produces wonderfully detailed and clear close-ups.Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. I know I should read more of the instruction book to get the best results and to use more of the camera's many features (I plan to do this). However, I did pretty well without the instructions -- that tells you that this is an \"easy to use\" camera.

If it falls, it is toast.-Screen is larger, but also are the pixels.

The main reason was because the wife wanted to go back to something smaller aka a subcompact camera.  I had to agree with her there after a few days of using the camera.Second, she did not like the recharge time between flash pictures.  I didn't time it, but it seemed like at least 5 or 6 seconds.  I guess that's fairly typical of cameras with 2 AA batteries, but I could be wrong.The subcompact we had before (Canon SD600) seemed alot better in this regard.  It used a proprietary lithium rechargeable battery though.My beef with the camera was the video wasn't as good as our previous SD600 camera.  And I guess the specs don't lie because they state 20 fps for 640x480 video instead of 30 fps with most other Canon digital cameras.  The IS seemed like it made the video more stable, but it also made panning with the camera more choppy.  It wasn't a huge beef as I don't take alot of video with a digital camera, but it was annoying they made the video worse.I also thought the construction was a bit cheap with the shell of the camera being plastic instead of metal.  The zoom lever seemed a bit cheap too.Now the good.  I like the dial on the camera.  It lets you quickly select a shooting mode.  Very handy.  On a subcompact you have to select modes through the menus at least on the old Canon we had.  The pictures seem fairly nice.  I wouldn't say they were better than our previous camera, but certainly I didn't notice they were that much worse either.  The fact it uses AA batteries is convenient because AA batteries are everywhere and  the access to the batteries, memory card and ports are easier to work with.  (It's not as tiny as on a subcompact.)  And this camera has lots of manual settings.ULtimately though the camera wasn't as sleek and small as the subcompact we had before.  It didn't take as nice of video and it seemed slower in between pictures specifically flash pictures.he only advantage to this one over a ~$200 CAnon subcompact would seem to be the convenience of AA batteries and a slightly greater zoom although perhaps some would find a larger camera easier to hold.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "New Yorker", "Author": "Stern Fan", "ReviewID": "R2OR32QFKTCD65", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buyer beware!  The A590IS requires two alkaline batteries; however the batteries last approximately  one to two weeks or less than approx. 75 photos.  The low battery indicator appears way too often.The A590IS has 8MP packed into a small sensor chip which causes the photo details/sharpness to be less than say a 5MP on the same size chip (it's called \"noise\" in a photo).  Advice when buying a digital camera; more MP is not necessarily better.  Look at the ratio of MP to chip size/capacity.  The lower the ratio of MP to chip capacity = more noise, because the MP take too much space on the chip thus blurring the photo with more pixels.  If you buy the A590IS, Canon packs 8MP on a small chip thus creating noise.  I had a Canon A610 for two years; 5MP on a small chip but alot less noise than the A590.  My A610's sensor chip died after two years (black LCD screen).  Bottom line, digital camera technology is not reliable; the life expectancy is not long.

The Canon A590IS provides excellent quality photos and video both indoors and out. I used it for an entire week's vacation in a a variety of settings with an 8GB SDHC card with no problems. The image stabilization is a huge plus for this camera, because the small point and shoots without it often result in blurry pictures, even in good lighting. This canon is easy to grip and take a nice steady picture. The result is you can usually get a good shot even with the flash off in normal room lighting, because the stablization keeps the shot steady during a slower shutter speed.I used all the various automatic modes like indoor, kids, pets, landscape etc with good results, but auto and P mode seem to do the job in most situations. The video results are very good, even though they are only 20 fps, but this only effects fast action like a sports event, and even then is not really noticeable. I made a video of a flag football game that came out fine. I tested all the modes up to 8 megapixel. The 3M fine mode is my default for normal situations.The only downside of this camera is the battery life. For some reason, the camera shows the AA batteries are low even though they are only slightly discharged. As a result you have to often change the batteries, even though the batteries you take out still measure well into the green charged range on a battery tester. So do not throw away batteries after you take them out of this canon. They are still fine for any other device. Canon needs to fix this problem.Otherwise great camera at a great price for both photo and video.

I knew that the shape of this camera (because of AA batteries) would be easier to hold than my tiny SD Eplh's (it is) yet still provide a more than adequate point and shoot when set to auto. Another thing about this camera that I liked is the viewfinder which makes a nice transition for someone who is not used to digicams with lcd screens on the back. The image stabilization (IS) is also worth it's weight in gold when you consider that older digital cameras had to be held absolutely still to get a good picture without blurring. My dad loves this camera..he has already stopped using the viewfinder (which is barely adequate imo)and bought rechargeable AA batteries and a nice case for it.

It's seen hard service.  Not as hard as the Elph it replaced, which died an untimely death from a 70 mph pavement impact. But I digress.So, as I was saying, I've dragged this camera to heck (Missouri, specifically) and back.  Well, beyond back; it's been as far west as the Oregon Pacific coast.  I usually keep it in the pocket of my motorcycle jacket, where it enjoys whatever weather protection the textile jacket affords.  It worked perfectly for years, and then (probably because of bugs and road grime stuck in the lens cover) the lens stopped opening or closing completely.  I'd turn it on, take a shot, and then discover that the lens cover hadn't completely opened, leaving black triangles on the upper right and lower left corners of the shot.  But a bit of cleaninig made the problem go away.The modes:I've never understood what the difference is between auto mode and easy mode.  Both of them are complete \"point: shoot\" modes.  The night snapshot mode is good for exactly what you'd expect.  And the macro mode is very useful.  I never did manage to get any decent results from the manual focus mode.  I do like that it's easy to turn off the flash (an option that many more point and shoot operators should take advantage of; if your subject is more than a couple of feet away, you're better off without the flash - spectators in stadiums, take note).  Something else I like about this camera is that the shutter lag is unusually short; it's not quite DSLR-instantaneous, but it's darn fast.  One last point of praise; the inclusion of an optical viewfinder is great.  It has real advantages over using the LCD screen to set up the shot, especially in bright sunlight.Now the \"but.\"  This is an older camera.  For what this costs, you can set yourself up with a decent used DSLR or a much newer point and shoot, with features like sweep panorama, smile detection (not just face detection), and so on for much less money.  Note that I'm not saying you can get cameras with more megapixels.  You can, but there are much more important criteria than megapixels.  Unless you print bigger than 11x17 on a regular basis, and you need to crop down and then print that big, you don't need tons of megapixels.  8 megapixels is plenty; heck, if you never print bigger than 8x10, 4 megapixels will do just fine.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice old camera", "Author": "Scott Mc", "ReviewID": "R27LLZ56BLX2P0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my second digital camera I had and I loved it, I brought it everywhere and it took amazing pics.

The newest successors use Li ion batteries, have the hard-to-grip flat and tiny form factor and are loaded with unneeded sensor pixels (>12M) to jack up the price.- The incredibly ugly 'software' (if you could call it that) that comes with the camera.

It does use regular AA batteries, which is a real plus when traveling.  Cameras with special batteries can be a pain if you forget the charger, or run out of power in the middle of an event.  It is very hard on those AA's, so I would budget in an AC adapter if you do indoor shooting.  I have used the camera both for work projects to photo-document machines and testing, as well as fun events like car shows.  It comes with optical and digital zoom, as well as the cool Macro mode (I keep calling it Flower Mode since that's the symbol on the button) which I use a lot in my work.  An unusual COOL feature is the 1/8\" phono jack which continuously outputs an NTSC signal which can be viewed on any standard TV with an RCA video input jack.  You can go directly to VHS tape if you wanted to, or have a monitor running during your work to simplify aiming and shooting.  I've not seen other cameras with that ability.  The video capability is nice to have as well to make small movies. My favorite feature is the memory card.  I upgraded to a high-speed SanDisk Ultra II 2GB card with 15MB/second rate to capture movies.  Remember that not all SD cards are created equally.  Think of it as the difference between USB 1 and USB 2.  For video, it is best to get a high data rate card.  The supplied SD card is very tiny at 32MB and slow.  Be sure to budget in for a new SD card and possibly the AC adapter.  The great thing about the card is that most Dell laptops now have an SD reader.  I have one also in my desktop at home, so accessing photos IS A BREEZE!! NO SOFTWARE REQUIRED!!  When they created these memory devices as \"drives,\" that simplifies so much.  It comes with software if you want it, but in my high-stress work environment, I need the pics and I NEED THEM NOW.  Opening an explorer window is perfect.  I can preview them as I scan down the list.  I also recommend using the 640x480 size for easy drop-in into WORD documents.  So many people leave the cameras on their default settings wihtout realizing that the huge file sizes clot up WORD documents without improving image quality.

My PowerShot has been 1/2 way around the world and back, run over by a car and is still taking great shots.BEFORE buying this camera, would have also said that battery life is also a plus, as I much prefer AA batteries when traveling: you can recharge as needed but can always grab some at a corner store if you absolutely need to in a pinch.After researching current PowerShot models (on-line and in-store), I bought this A590 from Amazon for my 13 y.o. brother to take with him on his 1st trip to Europe - a school trip to London & France.  How very disappointed when, 4 days into his trip the camera 'went dead.'  It turns out we received a version of this camera from Amazon that required an additional WATCH-TYPE BATTERY FOR THE LENS.THIS IS NOT MENTIONED ANYWHERE IN THE CAMERA SPECS!!!!!!!  When I researched this camera in-store, the A590 I handled DID NOT require any batteries in addition to the standard AA's, nor did the user guide included with the camera mention anything about this additional battery.I might have actually bothered to return the camera simply due to this lack of disclosure, but this wouldn't have remedied the disappointment of a 13 y.o. boy.Has anyone else received an A590 with a similar issue?I still love the Canon products overall, but am unsure why the camera we received was not as described (by both Amazon and Canon).  I am currently researching new cameras for an upcoming trip.  I do not feel comfortable buying a camera again from Amazon due to this issue - how can I truly be sure that what I am buying is what I receive.....do I want to be in a remote Italian village when my camera dies for some unknown reason?", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Happy with the purchase", "Author": "Newbie", "ReviewID": "R2FT5XSDLFWWP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It has been a satisfactory product.

It bridges the gap between a point and shoot camera and a DSLR camera.  This is good for someone interested in photography, but not sure that it will become a passion.  It allows you to shoot with an incredibly simple mode for quick snapshots of friends and family, but you can switch to the more advanced modes (including fully manual) for taking specific photographs.  I often use the camera in \"easy\" mode for general picture taking, but then I switch it over to \"manual\" for shooting serious photographs.Using the camera in \"manual\" mode is a bit annoying, because manual focus, aperture and shutter speeds need to be changed individually with the arrow buttons.  This is fine when taking the time to compose photographs, but annoying when trying to capture carefully composed photos on the fly.Having used this camera for about a year and a half at this point, I now have a much better understanding of what all the different factors of a photo are, and I have a very good idea of what I need in a higher-end camera when I upgrade in the future.This camera is a bit bulky, but not nearly as bad as a full-sized DSLR.  It's a good compromise for carrying manual features when you might not use them, such as hanging out with friends and not wanting to miss the chance for a great photo.  I carry mine with a Gorrilla Pod, but the smallest size is really too small for this camera.  It makes a really good (nearly) fully featured camera in a small package.Battery life is dramatically improved (it becomes great!) by using rechargeable batteries instead of disposables.  Otherwise, battery life bites.Interface with a Mac is a bit annoying, but not an issue at all.  You just have to do \"image capture\" under applications, and it will pull up a folder to transfer the pictures.  You can also set it up to download straight into iPhoto without any problems.  Windows the camera just pops up like any additional drive.This camera is really a cool camera, and you can upgrade it with various add-on lenses.

Canon has produced a great product for the economically minded amateur.  This camera has the great function of the \"easy\" setting.  This allows almost anyone to take great pictures.  Just select this setting on the dial and the camera makes all the setting adjustments for you, no matter what situation you are in.  The only down side to this function is that it takes a bit longer to actually take a picture.  I have noticed about a two second shutter delay, which isn't good if you are trying to take pictures of fast moving object, like children, but is fine if you have a cooperative subject.  There are also a few selling points that I can't argue with, such as price, megapixels, and variety of options to tweak.  At around $200, this camera has some of the most functions I have ever seen.  It rivals the $800 Nikon i used to own.  There are several shooting modes that can be easily selceted from the dial next to the shutter, but if that isn't enough control for you, you can select the aperture priority, shutter priority, or manual modes.  Each of these modes allows full control over the setting in your camera, allowing you to make the camera work in any way you desire.  This is great as a learning tool, or for the more experienced user who likes the full control.  Image quality is pretty good as well, I have only noticed some distortion at the highest megapixel levels and in extreme conditions (very low or very high light levels).  Overall, a great camera for anyone from the beginner with their first camera, up to someone who is contemplating an entry level DSLR.  This camera gives you the full range of use, from simply point and shoot, up to adjusting white balance, aperture size, shutter speed, and flash output, you can even change to manual focus.

Ripplinger", "ReviewID": "R2VDVKN1OE4CJZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Canon A590IS Powershot: The A line of digital cameras in Canon's Powershot line is the entry level and cheapest generally of their digital cameras. They use plastic bodies and are not as nice a quality as the Digital Elph line they make. That said, if you are looking for a camera in the entry level, that also runs on AA batteries (Their Elph line uses a rechargeable Li-ion battery pack), these are the way to go. This particular model has all the features you would expect on much more advanced models at a cheap price. You get all the auto modes including various scene mode options (although no Sport mode) and full manual modes on the camera as well, which enable you to pretty much do whatever you want with the camera. That is a plus if you are a camera buyer looking for something to learn and grow into, or in my case an avid Digital SLR user who wants a small camera when lugging around your DSLR and gear is impractical.The specs on the A590IS:Canon 8MP sensor with Digic III image processorCanon 4X optical zoom2.5\" LCD with viewfinder as well (a rare thing these days)Face DetectionThe lens is also Image Stabilized to reduce blur and camera shake.Power source: 2 \"AA\" size batteriesPros in my opinion:A full line of manual features (for example the \"M, P, Tv and Av modes)\"AA\" batteries for power, although many out there don't like them. Its just my preference. If you are on a trip, and you forget your charger for your camera that uses one of those Li-ion batteries, you're screwed. With this camera, you can buy batteries anywhere. I use Duracell's rechargeable 2650mAh rated NIMH type and I seem able to get around 400 shots before putting new ones in. The camera is also easy to hold, because of the large grip. Most of the new A line have been shrunk and don't have the same grip anymore, which I don't like.Cons: The lens mechanism is slow when you want to change your focal length. The noise in the images is pronounced, even at pretty low ISO's because of the fact that 8MP is packed onto such a tiny sensor. I don't know if that problem can ever be solved. But, I haven't really played with the newer A1000 or A1100, because maybe they do better now. Potential lens problem: the lens gears fail and the lens no longer retracts. This is pretty rare though, and newer cannon models seem to have that issue worked out better. No Sport Mode! You can forget trying to capture fast moving subjects very well.Even after the cons, I would reccomend any of the A line of the Canon Powershot line if you want an inexpensive camera or you are looking for your first digital camera. They have better reliability than other brands in this class of camera (especially over Kodak and Olympus!). I make this statement based on my years of experience selling these products. I have rarely seen Canon cameras come back with problems. The only real problem I have seen on Canon is the lens mechanism failing.So all in all, I recommend this camera or generally any Canon Powershot. They beat the competition for quality and features.Also note, I recommend you use a type 4 or type 6 SDHC memory card, not the slow type 2 SDHC cards. The faster cards make the camera operate much better in terms of responsiveness. I use Sandisk's Ultra II line of card. They read and write up to 15mb /s and make a big difference over the slower regular line of cards from them or any other manufacturer for that matter.I hope this review was helpful on deciding on this camera or any other of Canon's Powershot line. In my humble opinion, they are the best at this price point. :)", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera", "Author": "Ernest C.

Back in June I was traveling across Louisiana on my way from Brownsville, TX to Clarksville, TN when my A720IS managed to drop from my truck unnoticed. I had owned it for more than a year, was thoroughly satisfied with it and am still furious with myself for losing it! The A720 felt very good in my hands and had a very nice fit. The A590 is a bit smaller and doesn't feel quite as good, but this is purely subjective on my part and will not be the case for everyone. Build quality is not subjective: the zoom mechanism is disappointingly sloppy. The zoom lever doesn't have the same substantial feel as the one on the A720 and the whole zoom operation is considerably less precise. With the A720 the lens would 'stop on a dime' when the lever was released while on the A590 the lens continues to drive for a millisecond or so, just long enough to position the lens at an undesired zoom level and making readjustments quite necessary. The 4x optical zoom is adequate for most purposes but comes up short compared to the 6x of the A720. None of these things is a deal-breaker and wouldn't matter on their own. It is only when comparing this camera with the A720 that one notices the difference. In my opinion Canon took a step back with this camera, albeit a small step, and if you are able to find the 720 for a reasonable price I would recommend it over the 590; however, both are capable cameras that take good quality pictures and both will serve you well. There are still a few 590's for sale off the shelf in stores and the clearance prices make them very attractive buys, especially now that both they and the A720 have been priced way out of reason in on-line stores.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Christine \"Chris\"", "ReviewID": "R1AL9TZVU6G1TX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes very nice pictures.

But it's my 4th one in 4 years - that's an average of 1 per year!  My history, in brief:- We bought a competitor's camera, which broke in 8 months (zoom lens got off track), fixed it, then broke again 5 months later.- We bought our first Powershot, then left it on the train. (Whoops!)- Got another one, then dropped it on stone in the Kaibab Nat'l Forest in AZ (Whoops!)  This one, however, was packaged with a Selphy photo printer (Bonus!)- Got a third one, which had a bigger viewing screen and more megapixels, but then after dropping a few times, a screw came loose inside and shorted out the circuit board so it wouldn't turn on - I found this by taking it apart after finding out the 1-year warranty expired.- Since the repair cost was $100, and I found out I could get the newer version for just a little more than that, I opted for the new version.I like this level of Powershot (in particular, the A590) for 3 reasons:  1) it's a good point and shoot with decent start-up time and recover times (except with flash on full power); 2) it has MANUAL mode to set your own F-stop, Aperture, and flash intensity, along with ISO and white balance, etc. - even manual focus; 3) it uses AA batteries (we use rechargable AA batts) and SD memory cards, which work with every other device we have.  If the rechargeables go out while we're away, I can just buy AA batts anywhere.You can read about the features - just warning that the flash recovery time is fairly slow (at least 10 seconds) in your Auto or Easy mode.  For this reason, I frequently use manual mode with low-intensity flash and 2.6 F-stop with 1/40 sec shutter speed for twilight conditions.You can collect a lot of data on your picture automatically, and the camera can remove redeye and crop shots, also you can analyze how well the picture came into focus.Also, a note - only the (current) A5xx (past) A4xx series Powershots have a clip on the front that comes off to add aftermarket accessories such as filters, wide-angle lenses, etc.In all, for this price, you get a top-notch camera that is NOT the best but is certainly by far the best, most reliable, and feature-full camera in this price range.

However, with all of these features comes a price (and I don't mean the price of the camera). I mean the price of batteries. It goes through batteries like a baby goes through diapers. A quick fix to this is to buy rechargable batteries. Even if you purchase Energizer or Duracell batteries, they do not last long (3-4 hours at the most). Also, you may want to be careful of the extending lens. Four months after I purchased this camera, the lens motor broke and it wouldn't focus or extend out anymore.

Berger", "ReviewID": "R2B8V5MCB2QVKV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have several DSLRs and many high-end lenses, but need something to carry with me on a daily basis. When my beloved Fuji F31 died, I needed a replacement and didn't want to spend a lot of money on a P&S; that would only see occasional use. Based on all the rave reviews of this camera and lts low price I decided to give it a try.First off, I notice that some reviewers are comparing this camera to much more expensive ones such as the A650 and deciding that the 590 comes up short. Considering the price difference (125.00 vs. over 500.00) I'm not sure this is fair. And comparing it to a DSLR is not worth commenting on.But anyway, on to this camera.- Image Quality: (always most important) - at ISO 80 or 100, image quality is excellent. The lens is nice and sharp. No complaints, in fact I'm pleasantly surprised. IS allows hand-held exposures at slow shutter speeds without flash, so you can use low ISO with less light. This is a good thing, because at anything over ISO 100 the image starts to degrade quickly. I'd say 200 is acceptable, anything over that stay away. My Fuji was the king (queen?) of high ISO, this camera falls over badly.- Controls: Amazing array of manual controls including Aperture priority, shutter priority, full manual, exposure compensation, flash compensation(!), spot metering, control of in-camera sharpening, contrast, and saturation, etc. Manual focus is actually usable, and the viewfinder magnifies the center of the image for easier focusing. Lots of good features for macro photography. There is really nothing left to be desired, in fact there is almost too much, this is just a partial list.Negatives:Build: While build feels ok to me, the battery door is rather flimsy. In order to get the card out, you must open the battery compartment and if you are not careful the batteries will fall out. You quickly learn to cope with this however.High ISO: Mentioned above. Not really useful over 200.Battery Life: Sucks. Pardon my language. The worst I have ever seen. My Fuji specialized battery lasted FOREVER on a single charge. Don't believe the specs, they are wildly optimistic. Plan on buying rechargeables.Overall Rating: Considering the price, the image quality at low ISO, and the level of controls, this camera is an amazing value. The biggest drawback is the battery life. I leave it to each of you to decide whether the high ISO is important to you: if it is, don't buy this camera.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful", "Author": "Tamunotonye Davids", "ReviewID": "R338IWI16AP0T6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera gives you the pictures you want,the battery life is a serious draw back.Canon should have used lithium battery,they got it wrong with this product and i hope steps are taken to correct this short coming.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Compact, easy to use...", "Author": "loadedlemons", "ReviewID": "RWLK6RUX1WU48", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for my wife for Christmas.

Many cameras lack that feature, but I do much better by using a viewfinder than by using a digital display.  The reason I prefer a viewfinder is that I have continuous focus lenses in my glasses, and it's tough for me to look at a digital display and simultaneously at my subject, but with a viewfinder that's not an issue.  This camera has a good viewfinder.3)I wanted a camera with a range of features.  This one, of course, has several photo capabilities, plus video capabilities.4) I wanted a camera that uses a standard sized battery so I can get replacement batteries wherever I go.  This camera uses two AA batteries - so no problem there.5) I wanted a camera that uses a standard SD card to store images, and this one does.  That makes it EASY to upload images to my computer, and even to remove the SD card and plug that card directly into a digital photo frame, or into my TV which has a slot for an SD card.6) I wanted a camera I could grip - and the shape of the camera allows that.All in all, this is a great camera for family's and my camera needs.Lest you think that this camera is the end all be all of cameras, it has are a few shortcomings.  One such shortcoming is that the viewfinder does not have framing guides in it, so you have to guess at where the edges of the image will be.  When you use the viewfinder the image captured will have more space around the edges than you can see through the viewfinder, especially if you happen to wear glasses, which make it more difficult to get your eye close to the viewfinder.All in all, though, I think that this is definitely a 5-star camera for this price range.

I purchased the Sunpak UC-VL compact video light which works independently of the camera (must be turned ON and OFF manually) but this assists in taking movies in low light.  Overall, I would highly recommend this camera.

It was so cheap I couldn't resist (only $109). I like being able to take short video clips and wanted the higher MPs for photos and needed something small for days when I don't want to lug my DSLR + lens around along with my diaper bag. I think it'll do the job well. Some things I dislike though: 1) The camera is slow on rechargeable batteries unless the batteries are fully charged. Noticeably slower than with the A520. 2) Also powering on/off is noisy due to mechanical noise associated the lens opening/retracting (this is audible and unpreventable even with all volume/sounds turned off except for playback & the self timer). Much more audible than our Powershot A520 and I would be nervous using it in a quiet setting like a wedding or funeral.My major gripe is with the new Zoombrowser 6.1 software that came with the A590IS. The A590IS won't work with the older Zoombrowser SW I have (version 5.0), images show up as question marks and do not download at all. I did not have any problems removing my old SW as a previous reviewer mentioned--my Dell laptop running Windows XP actually automatically removed the old version and installed the new version when I loaded the CD-ROM that came with the new camera.The most annoying feature of Zoombrowser 6.1 is that it automatically connects you to the \"CameraWindowDC\" interface that has no instructions and just a bunch of buttons to click on if you plug the camera in using the USB cable to download images. I can't find a way to bypass this interface and still connect to the camera. This method of connecting takes away the option to set the individual image file names and download folder name automatically as was possible with the Zoombrowser 5.0 version--I like to use the shooting date + a 4 position sequence number and I like give folder names that reflect the event/occasion, not simply the shooting date.So now there are many extra steps to rename the files and move them into an appropriate folder. However, the features to set the file names and download folder are available if you use ZoomBrowser 6.0 to connect to a memory card (like when I download images from my DSLR using a USB-based multi-memory card reader). In Zoombrowser 5.0, you had the option whether you were connecting directly to the camera or a card reader or directly to a memory card.So now the best way for me to download the images from the A590IS while maximizing the utility of Zoombrowser 6.0 is for me to take the SD card out of the camera and put it into the built-in SD card reader in my laptop. Then I have the option to select a specific download folder & set the way I want the images named as they download.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Clear precise pictures, and easy to download.", "Author": "Lorie A.

I have had very few blurry pictures, even though I was constantly taking pictures with shutter speed of 1/8 ~ 1/15.Battery: The \"low battery\" warning comes up prematurely sometimes, and it is quite annoying. Once I figure out that I can easily take 400+ photos on a set of Eneloop (or Rayovac Hybrid), I have learned to simply ignore the warning. I love the fact that it uses AA batteries, one less device I have to remember to charge.Auto Mode: If you allow the camera to decide all the settings for you, you should be able to take decent pictures consistently. Good lighting produces good pictures, bad lighting produces bland pictures, on par with most other entry level cameras. Noise level at ISO 320 is not noticeable, unless you are looking for it.Shutter/Aperture Priority Mode: Disappointing. The EV setting does not work properly when the flash is activated. And I use flash a lot in non-auto mode.Manual Mode: Great feature. You can combine different levels of flash with proper ISO and shutter speed to get great result. Instead of bland, washed-out indoor pictures, I was able to obtain good vibrant photos. Once you get the hang of it, you are usually adjusting between flash level and shutter speed, so it's not very complex to use.Size: It's a little too thick to fit in pants pocket, but should fit in some coat pocket fine. Its shape provides good grip, allowing better shot taking.Flash: The recycle time is fast enough for me. I suspect it's due to Eneloop.Reboot: The camera sometimes slows down after extended use. This is easily corrected by shutting it off, then turning it back on.Overall this camera is very fun to play with. The manaul adjustments allow you to do so much more than a regular point and shoot camera. However, when you bring your A590 to the company party, you would wish some of these features are available in the auto mode too. As a practical camera: 4.5 stars. As a toy: 5 stars.", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "M.

As you can guess I eventually made the purchase and can say I am very content with the camera.Being an amateur at photography, I haven't been too good at getting live-action shots, so the Image Stabilization was good catch for me. However after extensive use of the camera, I must say that and the night scene/portrait shots are the two features I have been fairly disappointed with.The detail of most shots is superb, but that one particular core feature (image stabilization) is nothing above or less than mediocre.So out for a rating out of 5:Overall Performance = 4Ease of Use = 5", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS CAMERA!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2347HB8T1WFR7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my camera in September 08 shortly before my birthday.

Anyway, I have yet to read the guide or watch the video but have been using the camera almost daily for 2 months.I love the quality of the pictures and unlike a 35mm, good light is not that important.  I take a lot of pictures inside with pretty lousy light.  The memory card that comes with the camera will let you take about 12 pictures but it only takes a minute to download the pictures onto your computer and clear the card.  I am going to get the 1 GB memory card and camera case that Amazon offers, they are only $15.95.  I have noticed that this camera burns through double A batteries pretty quick but it only takes two double A's. I ignore the low battery warning and keep going until the batteries are completely used up, this lets me get another couple days of use.  Anyway, I love this camera!

I need a camera that is easy to use, and takes good photos suitable for printing, thus the 8 MP minimum requirement. The A590IS turned out to be my choice for several reasons. The Canon reputation, Price, and available add-ons. This camera is selling for $185.00 at our local WalMart in Erie, Pennsylvania. One thing to note is the two Opteka lens made for this model, and sold here at Amazon.con. One Telephoto, and the other a wide angle lens. So if I decide one day to become more involved with photography, I can make some very inexpensive upgrades to this camera. Did I mention this camera has an \"EASY\" setting ? Yes ! When I don't have the time to show friends or family, that wants to use it, the features of this camera, I just set it to \"easy\" and hand it to them. The anti shake, image stabilization works great too. There are so many features on this camera, I'm still amazed at the price, and it's been lowered even more since my purchase in October 08. It fits my hands nicely, as it's not too small, but much smaller than a digital SLR. I also bought the PSC-85 Deluxe Case and its perfect match for this model even though the case is not advertised to fit this model.

It served me well, the outdoor pictures with a lot of light is quite good and it still works okay for occasional family shots. 6 year down the track I think it is time to upgrade to newer technology. I brought the Canon A590IS based on its good review in Amazon and I like the feature set on spec. I brought it at a local camera shop at A$163 a couple of months ago and it came with Canon's leather case and photo printing voucher.I would not hesitate to recommend it to others. The good points about the camera are:Excellent pictures with \"ease mode\" especially outdoor and not bad for indoor under normal lighting. A bit noisy for indoor when the lighting is dim, better use the flash to compensate.If you have time, the manual controls are great and let you create your own effects. The Canon Browser record all the camera parameters for each photo which is great for budding photograher. Despite some review's caution against poor battery life, I was pleased with what I can get from a pair of 2650 mAH NiMH rechargables, I used it for over 200 photos before feeling the need  recharging.The only down side for the camera, is its physical size, it's not a camera you can put in your shirt pocket.

If so, I haven't found it.  I'm kind of annoyed to have to turn flash off every time I turn the camera on.5) Contrast seems overly sensitive on this camera.  Bright spots in uneven light tend to be over-exposed.

Huh. Well, would you look at that. So much for your battery theory pal.\"After embarrassing him thusly, his only \"solution\" was to send the camera in for Canon to look at it (at my expense).

Recycle time is also slow. The camera has a view finder, but it's pretty much useless since it's tiny and very inaccurate. The 2.5\" 115k low resolution LCD screen is where you can tell this is a budget camera. It does its job, but is fair at best. The video mode is limited. You can't zoom during recording, and fps has been limited to 20fps. On the positive side, battery life seems improved over previous \"A\" models. There are some manual modes.

I have to crank up the custom color settings to avoid washed out colors. Noise has not been a problem for me so far. Do all cameras in this price range produce pictures which require touching up? This is good and bad news. Pictures usually require a little sharpening and some contrast adjustment and these pictures respond well to the adjustments.

When climbing ladders, I put it in my pocket so it sometimes changes to another setting without me knowing it.  For its size the zoom is good but you always would like more.  I would prefer if it had a little more wide angle setting for some of the shots I have to take.  The flash is OK and does a pretty good job eliminating redeye and I suspect does just as well as its competition in terms of effect distance, harshness and redeye reduction.The quality appears to be excellent.  I have not had one performance problem with it even though I have dropped it a couple of times.  By the way, the A630 is still going strong too.  When you are out on a claim you can't afford for your camera to quit on you so the A630 goes along as a back up.  The only time I sue it is when I need the flip view finder.Let's face it, since the coming of the digital age, Canon has been the number 1 seller and there is a reason for that.  I also have a Canon Rebel SLR that I bought right after I retired from professional photography and it has also held up well and provides excellent exposures.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "B.

The picture quality is excellent and the controls are much easier to use than my former camera (Panasonic).

This results in images with appreciable pixel noise.  The instruction book fails to mention that the memory card limits the number of pixels per image that can be set.  (The camera should be supplied with a larger memory for only a small increase in price). In any event the purchase of a larger memory should be a #1 item for the new user.2) I failed to see any warning about leaving the camera in a hot environment such as in a car parked in the sun.3) The focusing mechanism looks like it could be damaged by grit getting into the mechanism.

I don't have much knowledge and wanted a camera where I could easily use the auto mode.  Well, the pictures always came out too dark even when a flash was used.  Luckily I dropped the camera and broke the lens for it made me do in depth research before I purchased this little gem of a camera.I needed a workable camera for a New York City trip and I heard good things about Canon as well as this camera in particular.  I am thrilled with my purchase.  It is a small camera that is also very sturdy and an excellent piece of equipment.  Many electronic items now come with cds to read the manual.  This one actually came with many manuals and they were lenghthy and definitely user friendly.  Everything is described in full detail from first set up of the camera to the great enhancement features this camera possesses.But luckily for me I was able to go to New York and use the camera in the auto mode and it took amazing puctures whether it be day or night, cloudy or sunny.  The detail is amazing and color is crisp.  Whem I the pictures to mt computer again there were easy to follow instructions provided.  Everything about this camera is A+ and I can't wait to explore the more advanced enhacements it has.  No item is perfect and people are complaining about the battery life with the camera.  I have had no such problem.  I own a 4 AA battery rechargeable kit and I put freshly charged batteries into the camera and went 5 days, taking over 200 pictures without the batteries needing to be changed.  Now 2 more weeks have gone by and those same batteries are running strong.With so many oprtions out there with electronics it is very important to go by others experience using the item and really read their opinions to see what applies to you.  For me this camera receives the highest grade.  I can use the auto mode as I desire for perfect pictures and there are many great additional features to utilize as I progress as a photographer.  I now also trust Canon and learned my lesson about Nokia.

If I were a professional photographer I probably could make use of all these things, however, I'm just a vacation shooter and am overwhelmed by all the bling.  Thankfully there is an \"auto\" mode that can be chosen that turns this equipment into a simple point-and-shoot device.

My usual camera of choice is a Canon digital SLR, but I wanted a small point-and-shoot digital for times when I can't carry my big camera around.This camera is okay.  The photos taken indoors with flash are often dark and a bit grainy, especially if the zoom is used at all.  I'm rarely happy with the way my indoor shots turn out.  It does best outdoors - those photos have much better color and brightness.  However, in auto mode it does a poor job with moving objects - they always blur.  I have to play around a bit with the other modes to see if I can get better action shots with it.In summary, this camera isn't as good as I hoped, but it's better that having no camera at all.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this camera.", "Author": "appstatephotographer", "ReviewID": "R19HXR2XKW75VW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this camera for Christmas back in December of 2008. The image quality on this camera is mediocre at best. Never takes decent photos, no matter what setting is used or who the photographer is. Camera worked for three years, then, while stored in a carrying case, the zoom lens started making a clicking and snapping noise when the zoom was being used. Turns out one of the plastic gears inside the lens had snapped a tooth, even though the camera was treated very nicely.After replacing the gear inside the camera, the camera proceeded to commit suicide. All pictures are severely underexposed and not as sharp as they should be, there's a tiny spec of dust on the CCD on every photo. It's a pitty, because I could work around the \"not as sharp\" problem, if Canon had bothered to include a manual focus feature. But no, of course they didn't.This camera has no redeeming features for the price. You cannot set the exposure time any lower than around 3 seconds. The battery life is absolutely terrible and the camera goes through AA's like nobody's business. The lens design isn't what I would call best in class, and therefore the color depth on photos sucks. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!! Buy a Lumix instead. For around the same price, you get a much better camera that will last a long time.

The spotlight review pushed me over the edge too, and unlike him, I know next to nothing more complicated than a P-38 can opener. (See my review.)This camera comes with a 79-page software starter guide. (If you go beyond that it will be upside down and in Spanish.) Like a car owner's manual, it will be in my drawer for the next several years, largely unread. It also comes with a 199-page user guide, which like my car owner's manual will be in my drawer for the next several years, largely unread. There is another one that says Guia del usuario del la camera. (I might have a harder time with that one--that is 208 pages.) There is a solution disk. (That word sounds hopeful.) There are two, AA batteries and a puny 32 mb memory card included that might see me through Christmas Day, but I won't take the chance. (I'll replace that with a 4 GB card from Kingston at $8.99 including shipping.) Besides cables whose use I understand about as much as I would a Hindu chant, it comes with a neat little neck strap which I am sure to lose in record time.I ordered this yesterday, regular shipping, through J & R World where smart New Yorkers shop, which might explain why I got it here today, or just because I live in the same city. It's one of the many discount stores that seems to survive when others go under, and the price was $100 less than the ancient Nikon I thought was such a deal five years ago.I usually think of products like these using a Blanchard/Hersey Leadership Model. S1 is Ho-No; S2 is Ho-Hum; S3 is Ho-Kay, and S4 is Ho-Ho. This is very Ho-Ho, which is also appropriate for the season. I will try and take a picture of my Christmas tree with it, and post it, before my great nephews and great niece destroy it this Sunday.Floyd also advised me to spend even more money on better batteries and a recharger that tells you when your batteries are fully charged, and stops charging them, thus saving battery life.

This format is used to save memory stick space, but folks, memory is cheap! It locks you out of good computer processing of your images, something your grand-children might want to do with your images, even if you don't. Use of this format is unecessary for any camera over 2 megapixels. and harmful to your photographic health. You need \"raw\" a faithful image of what your camera sees.THat's the bad news, but the good news is the camera mfrs are finally coming out with raw shooters in this price range. So wait. And also look for cams that do bracketed exposures automatically at different exposures, emiting raw. Then you've got the photographic world by the horns because you can do HDR, high dynamic range. It's actually easy.I am looking for a small cam to compliment my $5,000 Nikon monster, but I won't settle for a jpeg-shooter.What's that You say you just want to take a few snaps and dont care about this rocket-science? Let me tell you a story. A friend's wife sent me a pic of animals expressing friendship to each other, a real \"aww shucks\" photo that I loved and wanted to print out and process. But it was in low res jpeg. Useless. OK, hi res jpeg would have been better, BUT:It won't cost you much more money to use raw. Why not get your money's worth? You have an advanced 10 megapixel range sensor in even the cheapest cam these days, why throw it away on jpeg when some engineer made the wrong design decision? It's yours for your money, free! Demand it! ANd you don't have to use raw all the time, a simple switch will set you to jpeg if you want throw-away pics...Wait like a cat and pounce when the camera mfrs offer raw with bracketed exposure.By the way, programs to process photos on your computer are often free. Photomatix is used for HDR, using raw. Gimp is a free photoshop clone. Now HDR will give you control over your exposure of dark and light areas of your photos. A crappy shot will be saved and maybe turned into a wow shot. It's hard to shoot perfect photos out in the field. I have spent hours getting the \"right\" shot. Then I saw what computer processing can do, and I instantly realized that it could make a pro photo from an inexpensive camera. Or a good phto from a lousy shot. And most of your shots will be lousy, trust me. Even the pros throw away 90% of their shots. Less work, wow quality, mmmmm.

Although it received many good reviews, my experience with the camera was very disappointing. Thw first big surprise was that although this is labeled a point and shoot digital camera, it has many features that allow an experienced photographer to modify the settings and make custom modifications.  I'm not an experienced photographer and was easily overwhelmed by the choices, especially since the instruction manual jumped right in discussing these things before it even explained the basics of how the camera worked.  The book didn't get to the basics until page 40!  I have 2 other digital cameras that I've used for several years  so I am familiar with how many digital cameras are set up----not that this helped.  This model Canon represents some significant design changes in digital cameras which I wasn't prepared for.  To make things worse, the instruction manual in many cases was incomplete or inaccurate.  I quickly became best friends with Canon's technical support department just to learn how to use the camera! Although the tech reps were pleasant and tried to be helpful, sometimes they didn't know the whole story either.  I also had problems with the software that comes with the camera for downloading pictures to my computer and editing them.  When I first installed it, it worked fine.  Then everytime I used it something went wrong and I had to call tech support for assistance.  The problem would get resolved only to reappear a few days later and the prior solution wouldn't work any more. Even the tech reps couldn't explain why  While the camera worked OK most of the time, it didn't function correctly all of the time which was really frustrating.  Also the picture quality was inconsistent.  Some pictures came out good, others (taken the same way) were lousy. I had so many problems with both the camera and software, even though they were brand new, I came to the conclusion that maybe I got a defective model so I returned it.  After everything the camera put me through, I didn't want to waste my time trying another one so I am looking for a different digital camera to replace my older ones.

Sadly, none of the reviews I found mentioned how cheap this camera feels. As soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it was made out of cheap plastic, and several of the buttons were loose and shaky. I thought that I would get used to it, but every time I picked it up, it seemed to feel more cheap and plasticky. The picture quality on it was about average. Nothing special and a little grainy. That picture quality would only be acceptable on a cheaper camera with a more sturdy build. The Canon is also very slow. It takes a long time to turn on, and a long time to focus and take a picture. The many delays can be devastating if you plan to us the camera taking nature pictures. An animal could runaway before you have the camera turned on. Because of all these things, I returned it the same day that it came. I gave this camera two stars instead of one only because of the considerable number of high reviews. There must be something good about this camera, however, I could not see what it was.I bought the Nikon Coolpix S550 camera instead. It feels very sturdy, and can take excellent pictures. I have even dropped it several times and the Nikon barely scratched (this camera felt as if it would shatter if you were to drop it). However, if money is not a factor, and you don't care to much about picture quality, and you can be very gentle with this fragile camera, then this is the camera for you.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Important Con's", "Author": "Larex Croft \"Larex Croft\"", "ReviewID": "R3NE35TEGQD0FW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off, the 8 mp advertised is quite inacurate. The pictures are hazy and the sharpness of the images are horrible! The flash stays on and distracts the person/animal that you are snapping a shot of. The shutter speed is slower than advertised. More minor details that also bother me:The plastic has a cheap feel, the battery compartment WILL NOT LAST. The door holding the batteries in is barely strong enough. The plastic is so flimsy that it will break soon. The worst part of the camera to me is, to remove the SD card you must open the battery compartment, which resets the time and date. So, everytime you remove the SD card you have to reset the time and date which is NOT good for quick shots or battery life. The battery life is not good on this camera.

I'm going to make this as simple as can be...the Canon Powershot A560, in my opinion, is probably the best digital camera anyone could get.

I say that the A560 is the best for many reasons. For one, it's price is as reasonable as can get. Another reason the A560 is the best is that I have probably dropped mine like 10 times already and the only harm the camera got was a few scratches here or there. Now a digital camera with this kind of durability is awesome. Other digital cameras end up being ruined after a couple of drops. First, a feature or two stops working.
