This falls into the category of \"what will they think of next?\"  The camera itself is a solid performer for a point and shoot with a slightly better than average 5x zoom which is great for a point & shoot model.  Of course, the projector is the \"WOW!\" factor.  No more squeezing around the display on the back to show your friends the photos.  The projector is a great way to share your images.  The image quality is not as high as the LCD display, but fine for quick showings.As an artist, I will use this camera to shoot new subjects, then project them onto a canvas so I can transfer the compositions into a painting.Be sure to order the larger Nikon case since the other \"S\" cases are too small for this model.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "A one of a kind", "Author": "Warren Flarity", "ReviewID": "R183BC0NBNQE7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I concur with the other 5 star reviews. It is for small groups of 4-5 viewers. It is not as bright as the big boy 2000 lumen, but adequate within its limits. I am also a hobby artist, with the projector I can store comps, project, and rough out line art. This alone makes it worth the purchase. The innards are state-of-the-art, as good as any other 12meg pix P&S.; There is a lot of undiscovered potential lurking within. One drawback is that the only input to the projector is via the camera. somewhere, somebody will hack the file format on the SD card so you can load your other pictures for projection.  I'll then give it 6 stars.Update:  here is a software that converts jpeg from other sources to Nikon coolpix s1000pj format that can be saved on SD card and viewed with the built in projector.  [...]. it works with other models and mfg's formats. Now I give it 6 stars. I can convert my powerpoint training slides for projection on the s1000pj, and carry it in my shirt pocket, now that's cool!", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Photos aren't sharp enough for a product this expensive", "Author": "R. Gale", "ReviewID": "RHBAZW2Z9QFLA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera for Christmas, so I've been using it for 2+ weeks.  Yes, the projector is very cool.  And the wideness of the lens is great.  The flash recharges fairly quickly.  But the photos I've taken with it aren't as sharp as those from the Casio Exilim camera I got 3 years ago.  And at the end of the day for me, sharp photos are more important than bells and whistles.  Also, the lens is in the upper right corner of the camera instead of dead center which is where the projector is (a strange design choice), so you have to be careful how you hold it so you don't get the edge of your finger in the image.  The flash is very bright, so you can't be too close to your subject when using it -- it washes out the image.  And because the lens is so wide, I did find myself getting closer to my subjects.  So unless you have some urgent need for the projector feature, I can't recommend this camera, especially given how expensive it is.  I've gone back to using my Casio camera...which is also lighter and easier to stick in my pocket.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon $149 camera w/ projector ... just buy it and enjoy the fun", "Author": "insandiego", "ReviewID": "R3985AGHO41B3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a $149 camera with a projector.  Keep this price in mind as you read my review or any reviews about this camera.  I own other compact cameras before but this one pushed me to write a review... it's that special!1) What will the projector do for you and does it really work?Yes, it really works.  It's really a fun and convienient accessory built into this camera.  You will be the star of the party when you start to shine photos and videos on the wall or any white surface nearby, I guarantee it.  The brightness all depends the distance from where you are to the wall or how dark the room is.  In a dimly lit party room or bed room, it's plenty bright enough for a 40 inch picture. In brighter rooms, then just make the image smaller down to about 10-20 inches, which is still way larger than the tiny 3 inch LCD on the camera to share photos with friends.  You might just be a bit nervous when strangers start to crowd around when you start your public slide show.2) Over all impression of the s1000pj = A+This is the camera to have handy to just have fun.  The s1000pj was a $500 camera a year ago and not worth it's price, but now at less than $150, there's no reason not to get it.  The s1000pj camera captures good enough pictures that would fit for any photo album or webpage or even reasonable enlargements to 11x14.  Seriously, who has the wall space to hang so many pictures on their walls?  Some people complain these small cameras are never good enough to do giant enlargements... to hang where? If you have the need for larger pictures then use a $1000 DSLR camera with a good lens.  Enough said here.3) Picture quality = AWhat I am saying is that for this small size camera at this price range, you just have to ENJOY your camera and ENJOY the images you capture.  No doubt there are other better cameras but with a projector?  This s1000pj camera works very well in daylight or well lit room.  In dimmer situations, the flash works well.  Without flash, well ofcourse the ISO will have to be little higher so expect some noise; it's not that bad, imho.  I really see that most people don't understand the value/compact camera and noise correlation.  Ask yourself what you use the camera for and buy the right camera for the purpose as priority #1, and make your budget priority #2.  Lastly, what should the camera do for you?  Make you a famous photographer or just to have fun and capture the images and share with family and friends?4) Build quality and useabilty = A+Nikon has worked wonders with this little camera.  Compressing the lens and a projector inside a very compact camera about the size and weight of a deck of cards.  I don't think it's bulky but some people say it is not factoring in that other smaller compact cameras don't have a projector!  With that said, the Nikon s1000pj feels solid and safe with a built in lens protector.  The lens is all internal and so no protruding lens to worry about while using it.  The camera is easy to use without weird complicated settings to worry.  The auto or pre-set Scene Selection works well enough for me.  Ok... people who complain this doesn't have all the manual settings and customization for experienced photography... GO GET A DSLR CAMERA FOR REAL TRUE PHOTOGRAPHY SETTINGS and ACTION!5) What are bad points?For about $149, this Nikon s1000pj camera does not have any negatives.  Really folks, people complain too much and want way to many things for free.  This camera will work just fine and does a special projection that no other cameras in this price have.  If I had to have something bad to say about the Nikon s1000pj is that the battery could be twice as big making the camera a little thicker so the projection time could be longer... oh I forgot, I guess I could just buy extra batteries!  The battery charger is external so you can charge while using the camera (other cameras you must charge battery inside it.----//----It's your money, it's your choiceIt's my money, then it's my choiceGot no money?, then get a job already!- anonymous", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Projector is the Great", "Author": "Chris Lawrenson", "ReviewID": "R3GD8SBGQTNYWM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Takes great pictures, easy to use, turns on quick, everything is great.You have to adjust the focus on the projector manually which is not a big deal, very easy to do, the adjustment is well placed on the top of the camera.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S1000pj", "Author": "Joe Hubler", "ReviewID": "R2S8EUOKQFGNAG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great camera, fast auto focus, good low-light focus.I am just disappointed with the battery life, I have 2 other compact cameras, one is also a Nikon, they both have much better battery life.i highly recommend you get 2 or 3 extra batteries.

I have put off buying a camera for a long time, even though my old camera is broken and dying, because I am not interested in a camera without a viewfinder.  I am an avid outdoorsperson, and I cannot see and frame a photo outside in sunshine when using the screen on all the new pocket digitals. It is absurd. But my old camera is broken and needs replacing, and I like the projector feature that started appearing on digitals in the past year, so when this one came up as a \"special\" on Amazon, I impulsively bought it.The first use was fun; filming an ugly Christmas sweater day at my office.  I got some decent photos and a pretty hilarious video of the office jackass up to his usual hijinks. (I say that lovingly -- he is NOT a jackass but he works overtime to keep us laughing so hence the unfair & inaccurate label). When I went to download the photos to my computer, I was very unimpressed with the camera/computer interface, which did not seem to be intuitive and kept separating still photos from videos and often had me scrambling to find pics I wanted to edit and forward to co-workers.  I did spend some time reading the user's guide, and I believe I have things configured properly on one of my computers to accept the downloads.  I will have to spend some time configuring my laptop and other computer however, to organize the photo and video files.  This seems like too much time to spend for the mediocre results; perhaps I was spoiled by the ease of downloading from my old Sony. I do not see the option to just download photos taken since the last download, and I am too lazy and impatient to pull up all photos every time and have to select individual shots to download. C'est la vie.The other annoyance is that when you take photos longways, you have to rotate them from the camera prior to downloading. What a drag. And there are videos that I shot that way that do not offer the ability to rotate 90 degrees at all. My loss.  My primo video of my funny co-worker dancing with a flashing-lights sweater can only be viewed horizontally. My co-workers are not impressed to get this gem at this angle.The projector feature is fun and was a hit at the office, but the photos I forwarded were not remarkable.  In addition, I have a very steady hand when shooting pictures and videos, but more times than not, I CANNOT seem to get a clear shot of anything moving, even in various modes that are designed for sports or action. At a recent bowling event with a lot of friends, we all took turns trying to get an unblurred photo, trying all shooting modes, and every photo except the still \"posed\" photos are blurred. There were no photos to commemorate the event on our website because they are all blurred, sometimes eerily. One photo of a guy bowling has swirls in place of his head and hands, but his shirt is crystal clear. What is that about? This has discouraged me from using it.I am also not happy with the need to use the screen to change settings before shots; I much prefer using an external dial or buttons to adjust settings before shooting. Sometimes the glow and beeping of preparing for a shot are too intrusive in terms of light and noise in certain settings, such as when someone is speaking and you are distracting the whole room to set up a simple shot.I am not willing to carry this camera for daily use, and I have not been able to successfully capture the moment more than half the time I have used it.  I am a person who has carried a camera with me every day for years, and I shoot a lot of photos and videos for work and personal use. After owning this camera for nearly 3 months, it is parked at home on a desk, collecting dust.  Luckily, I only paid $120 for this on sale, but it is $120 I would like to have back to apply towards a better camera.

The change in its projector bulb to DLP technology, has less heat produced and less power consumption and provides a larger projection size for all to watch. Both cameras are really nice. The S1000PJ has a better feel, built solid compared to the other two models. When switching to Scene Mode, the camera seems to take sharper, crisp photos.

And even better, it's popular over and over again.You might think something like this is a cheezy novelty that quickly wears off and is useless overall.  But this isn't true at all.  While there are some serious problems with this, like very low lumens, and a low resolution, that is offset easily by the simple fact that you can take pictures, shine it on a wall immediately, and show images to multiple people and laugh about those photos instantly.It's hard to beat and this is a feature I hope more cameras incorporate as a differentiator from smart phones.  While there are a few smart phones that have integrated pico-projectors, I highly doubt this feature will catch on quickly as the battery drain must be phenomenal.  and it's features like this that would really make me want to get another compact camera.

Brent", "ReviewID": "R1RHJNPZVK72XY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I kept this one in my wish list for a long time until my previous camera, a Casio Exilim, started to wear out. So I decided to go ahead and try it, because the projector feature interested me.The kit I got was a refurb, and came with add-ons like an external flash. I wasn't expecting that, so that was kind of nice (but then, I don't need it either...).The camera itself is solid, and the battery life was decent. It works fairly well and has all the features you would expect. The menu was a little confusing, but they all are. Where it comes down to the wire for me is the performance.All small portable cameras are a bit slow, but compared to the Exilim which I have been carrying for years, this one felt extremely sluggish, and even though my subjects were just walking by I missed more than half the shots I tried to take (and that at wide-angle). The pictures were taken indoors with sunlight coming in the window, but show bad grain as if light was insufficient, and many are out of focus. It's true I did not use the flash but I didn't expect to need to in this scenario, again based on my previous camera.I switched to video mode, which worked well enough. The highest resolution for video is only 640x480, however, and it takes just 24 minutes at a time. (On the plus side, there is no lag after stopping video and you can start the next one almost immediately). Videos are large - a 640x480 high quality video of 24 minutes took almost 1.5GB of space. Windows reports 640x480, 30fps, MJPG video at 8435kbps with 256kbps single-channel PCM audio at 16kHz. I didn't take any video where audio quality was important so I can't say whether it sounded acceptable, but video quality was decent.Better lit, posed still photos came out all right, and the zoom is nice. The camera is also acceptable in terms of size and weight - while it is thicker overall than my Casio was, it matches the thickest part of that camera and the lens does not stick out. I also very much liked the recessed power switch, as I never once turned the camera on in my pocket. ;)The projector gimmick works reasonably well. It definately impresses people to see it - and it's almost a shame you can't load videos and plug in an AC adapter, as doubling as a portable projector would be very nice! But you can't, you are limited to the photos and videos that you take with the camera (though I haven't looked at whether I can fake it ;) ). I had some difficulty getting a video to play with the projector on (I did it once, and another time couldn't work it out. Might have to read the manual. ;) )I did not install the software that came with the camera so I can't speak to whether it is any good.Overall, however, I am a little disappointed. Perhaps I have been spoiled all these years, but this camera feels like a step down to me, and although there is nothing really wrong with it, and the casual photographer may enjoy it, I can't really recommend it in general.

It would be so much better that trying to have everyone stand behind the camera and look at that tiny screen. Well, it is not much better. There are several things you need to consider before buying one. First, it is useless in the sunlight. You cannot see the image unless you shade it and then it is only slightly better. Two, you have to be about 5 to 6 feet from the wall. Farther than that and the picture blurs out too much to see detail. This becomes a real pain in that unless you live in a small travel trailer you do not usually have an available wall that close to show your pictures on so you have to stand up and go to the wall. Now everyone is standing for the entire slide show. Third, you need to have a wall! I never realized it but I have alot of pictures on my walls. I do not have many areas I can go to and project my picture on. Lastly, the wall has to be white. Any other color and it washes out your pictures details and color.
