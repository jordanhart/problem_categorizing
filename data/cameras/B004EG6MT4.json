Can set the sensitivity of the camera for motion recording ( 4 settings for each individual camera).  I use MOTION DETECTION...also can continuously record if you prefer. Can block areas of continuous motion as a flag or tree blowing in the wind so as not to trigger the motion detection. Playback shows date, time and can be played back at normal speed, or 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x and even 32x speed to search through recordings.....", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$159.50", "Features": "New - Retail\n1-Year Warranty", "Name": "DVR-H9104V Digital Video Recorder - 500 GB HDD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310OhOEltIL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004EG6MT4"}}
