I am a huge Canon camera fan and this is my first DSLR. It is so easy to use and does not feel cheap like some other cameras do. Its just the right weight....not too heavy but not too light. The bundle contains alot of useful items. The extra battery and charger with the adapter to charge in the car will come in handy on trips. The extra lenses and filters are a plus too. Everything that is listed in the description is in the box. I have been taking pictures non stop. I love it!! This is definetly worth the money!I added a couple of pictures to the item description.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Item", "Author": "Bipin Krishna", "ReviewID": "RLV7CUFC8W3EW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi,I purchased this item a few weeks back.
