Campos \"Kari Silva Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R3LAXVDCFS3L8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had probably ten different digital cameras over the last ten years, mostly Kodak, although the most recent ones were Canon.  I was spoiled with the 12x optical zoom on my Kodak Z1012 and the clear, sharp images it produced.  I don't want to carry it in my purse every day though!  I recently purchased a Canon SX110, which is small enough to carry daily and takes great photos; however, it doesn't allow for a date stamp except at 1600x1200 resolution.  After researching for several days online, I purchased a Kodak Z915 today.  Took it straight to the park and played with it.  Got some fantastic photos today.  I mean, I was surprisingly truly impressed by the clear, sharp images I got today for a relatively inexpensive camera.  I love the 10x zoom -- can't even imagine owning a camera with less after having that feature for a couple of years now.  This one does all that I need and does it well.  The movie mode seemed to have tiny shifts in focus while recording, but I don't use the video features on my cameras too often, so not a concern for me.  I may play with it some more and see if some tweaking of settings will allow for a smoother playback.  Again, can't say enough how happy I am with the image quality and that's my main requirement.", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Under Priced Quality Camera", "Author": "Michael E.

I compared features across other brands, and this came out as the lowest price for the same features.10MP means you can crop the heck out of your pictures and they won't turn grainy. The 10x optical zoom is a deal-sealer for me, since you have the option of getting in close to a subject when you want, without using the 'digital zoom' feature thats on digital cameras (which isnt really a zoom, and cuts down on picture quality).Optical Image Stabilization helps clear up shakey shots, lots of options for both the beginner/casual shooter, and more in depth choices for the experienced photog round out this awesome deal.Choice of colors is a nice touch, the icing on the cake.", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic photos for bargain price", "Author": "peamom", "ReviewID": "RKFX5LA5X5DXI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a Kodak z740 which also had 10X optical zoom and an eye finder, and took beautiful photos, but it was too clunky to fit in my pocket, and only 5mp with small screen so went in search of another camera. I first tried the Canon sx120IS, which was a major disappointment and you can see my review on it's product page. The Z915 on the other hand takes fantastic pictures. However, I must note that first camera I got was defective in that the outer edges of every photo were a bit blurry. I took a chance and exchanged for same camera as I loved the features and the great Kodak exposure. Well I'm glad I did because the new camera takes incredible shots.Here's what's BEST about camera:1) Sharp pictures with that wonderful Kodak vibrant exposure -- every one looks so warm and healthy.2) 10X optical zoom is incredible3) Camera has a \"stage\" scene that takes incredible photos of people on stage (I took some in off Broadway play) and camera makes no noise and no flash so no bother to the performers. If you have a kid in plays -- this camera is worth the price for that alone.4) Has a completely manual setting where you can independently set shutter speed, aperture, ISO, exposure and it will warn you in yellow if your settings do not jive with eachother5) Has a \"High ISO\" scene that takes incredible photos indoors in low light. I took some wonderful shots at an indoor basketball game where I was sitting 20 rows up off floor and zoomed in close to the foul shooter and pictures were great. (Note disable the flash or you'll miss an action shot - flash won't reach that far anyway).6) In display mode, has an \"i\" information button that tells you all the settings the camera chose even in scene or auto mode, so you can see what the shutter speed, aperture, iso, and exposure was for a particular shot and learn from it.7) Takes AA batteries which is super convenient. Batteries last days as long as you use good rechargeable batteries. Alkalines will work but not last as long. I bought a 15 minute Energizer charger with batteries.8) Super easy to operate. Very intuitive - you won't need to open the manual.9) Camera has does very well in minimizing noise. Check the online professional reviews and you will see the difference between this and the competition.Here's what could be better:1) This is not a sexy camera. A little clunky looking but fits well in your hand. Size tradeoff worth it for the 10x zoom2) Wish it had an eye finder for two reasons. Can be tough to see in bright sun. You may have to use one hand to shield the screen and the other to shoot. Also would be nice to have eye finder for the stage setting so audience at the play don't have to be bothered by the glowing screen as you take the pic (even though no flash or noise on that setting).3) I find putting the camera in P mode takes better photos than the smart capture mode, where the camera chooses a scene or settings based on what it sees. I took a picture of my kids playing wii video game in basement on both settings and the smart capture had some noise, whereas in the P mode where I left ISO in auto and let the camera choose everything else was noise free.4) The camera's find faces function is just so so, sometimes finding a few faces and not all. I found that if I want everyone pin point sharp in a group photo, hit the macro flower button on top of the camera to select Landscape (mountains icon appears), which gave me the most depth of field and everyone came out sharp - a must do for shots of people at a table where some close, some far.Note: The Kodak Z950 is the same camera, but a little smaller in size, 12mp as opposed to 10mp, same 10x opticle zoom, but proprietary lithium battery, and Schneider lens. It is a bit more expensive so if you want smaller size and proprietary battery (plan another $30 for extra battery and $40 is you want external charger), then try that one.Bottom line this is a great camera with stupendous optical zoom for a bargain basement price compared to the competetion. I gave it only a 3 star for portability as it is a little clunky compared to say the Panasonic Lumix with similar zoom. It's super easy to operate, but allows you many manual controls and a stage scene I've never seen on another camera.

Borah", "ReviewID": "R26MDB54ZLR8MR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the camera for the 10X optical zoom, because I'd like to get closer up pictures at concerts and I'm looking forward to taking pictures in the mountains this year with it. I already had a good Kodak camera, but with less zoom and less megapixels. So far, I haven't gotten to check out the zoom for things like that, but I've taken some close up pictures of a butterfly and gotten clear, detailed pictures. You can even see the barbs on its legs. It's easy to use, I like being able to crop my pictures on the camera, you can even add a sound tag onto your picture. I like that you can put it on smart capture and the camera does the work for you. Its a good, sturdy camera and even though I had read reviews that it was a little bulky, it is smaller than my last digital camera and doesn't feel bulky to me at all. So far, loving this camera!", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pro says: Exceptional camera at a ridiculous price!!", "Author": "Larry D Blumenthal \"Apollo sings!\"", "ReviewID": "RW1CTRGRPC4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Please read carefully: this is from a 35-year veteran Hollywood photographic professional who is both a still photographer and cinematographer. I carefully read the many reviews of the Kodak Z915, a very inexpensive digital camera. I noted comments of both those who raved about, as well as those who panned, this camera's performance. In fact, some of the criticisms gave me pause when deciding to buy my wife this model as a new camera for her birthday. She loves to shoot, but has no interest in a Canon D5 or such style of photographic gear. But quick photos from her cell phone were becoming a liability, especially considering her rather keen photographic eye and sense. So, without wanting to overwhelm her positive natural and artistic instincts with new gear of such professional level that she would be stifled by HAVING to control too much minutia, I decided to get her something viable for good results, yet not a fortune to buy or too complicated to learn! I am happy to report this gift was a huge hit! And here's why:1) First, fully ignore the complaints or bad reviews - either they know nothing about cameras or photography, can't follow instructions, or are simply too effing stupid or lazy to read the VERY CLEAR manual included. But mostly, these are people who go to taco bell expecting elegant epicurean dining. All my fears were allayed when I saw the Z915 in person.2) The camera functions as described and has exceeded ALL my possible expectations.3) The photos it produces, and the available functions to produce them, stagger the mind at this price!!!!!!4) The Schneider optics on this optical 10:1 zoom tracks well, has sparkling crisp resolution and is beautifully color corrected for achromatic distortion - very important for longer lens shooting - especially when combined with ...5) ...the amazing 10.5 megapixel resolution of this extraordinary consumer level camera system! There is plenty of room for up to even a another 5x digital zoom-in beyond the optical zoom limits to keep the image moderately clean on a 5x8 printed photograph. Bravo. In other words, if you were to crop an image to include only the words THIS IS ALL I WANT IN MY PIC from this review, it would still be a clear clean image.6) The features are perfect and all work well, from the SmartCam all-auto-point-and-shoot setting, to the many options for backlit subjects, intentional far or near focus even while auto-focus is working, to a setting which is fully manual wherein you must tell the camera what to do in every way just like a pro upscale still SLR camera. Plenty of shutter flexibility for sports, very fast turn around time for quick shots, quality for portraits and nature photography, lotsa special stuff for things like fireworks, red-eye, even document archiving! The only drawback I had was the lack of through-the-lens occular viewfinder for the eye. But most folks will prefer the wonderful LCD imager on the camera viewfinder anyway, which is set at half brightness from the factory and can be turned up for fair viewing even in sunshine! A viewfinder shroud can help this along for quite satisfactory results.7) And if all this isn't enough, the camera does amazing 3-panel digitally stiched panorama shots, and will video record image and sound in crisp Standard Definition video quite nicely. How fun. I noticed a couple folks bitched that the sound recorded was way down and therefore a big problem. As I said before, those morons are the problem. If they had simply looked at the diagram in the manual which tells you where the microphone is located (holes just at 10 0'clock of the lens housing), then they would have realized they had put their finger over the mic holes while they were video recording. Normally their forefinger should be on the zoom control anyway!In closing, let me just say that as a Hollywood photography professional there was no way was I going to just toss mama this camera, say \"have fun\" and then walk away. I did what all us camera and cinema geeks do - and that is take this little model through its paces. I am frankly shocked that Kodak pulled all this off for $120. No, it's not a high end professional replacement by any means, but my honey will no doubt take some amazing shots which might rival anything I would have\"planned\" to do with my Canon or Nikon. Eat your heart out Canon and Sony! Simply amazing.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Luv It", "Author": "J.

I love that I can zoom in and out while in video mode (maybe this is more common now but wasn't an option on my 6 year old kodak). I took video/stills at my daughter's swim meet last evening. I am very impressed with the quality and the zoom. I was able to capture her diving in the water (not even in sports mode).

The pictures are beautiful, very clear in a lot of different conditions.  The lcd is large and has great resolution.  I recently purchased the Kodak m380, and the lcd screen was larger, but the resolution wasn't good, so you really couldn't tell if you took a good picture until you saw it on the computer.  I ended up returning that camera because it didn't take good pictures, and I really missed the 10X zoom.  This camera has the portability of a smaller \"pocket\" type camera, but all of the features of a full size camera.  It is also a lot easier to hold and handle than the smaller m380.  That one was awkward to figure out where to put your hands for a steady shot.  It was almost too small.  This one is perfect!  I really love it, and the price was fantastic.

Frankly, people this dumb don't deserve to even think about handling a digital camera, let alone a computer.  It's 2010.  Today we have SDHC cards in digital cameras (jpeg compatibility), card readers, and printers (to print out manuals (even digital cameras costing 4X this price don't have printed manuals included).  Furthermore, if you don't like the software included with the product, don't use it.  Nobody's holding a gun to your head.  There are plenty of other photo software programs ready to accept your photos from this camera.  I don't care to dwell on stupidity so I'll move on.  I purchased this camera on an impulse buy.  I already have a compact Canon A590, and a megazoom Canon SX20, but needed a compact that had better resolution, and a greater zoom capability but wasn't as large as my megazoom.  I really wasn't expecting much from this Kodak Z915 and really was intending to return it after a few days, but upon using it for a week now, I'm fixed on keeping it.  The Kodak Z915 weighs approximately 280 grams with an added SDHC card and a good pair of Ni-mH batteries.  It measures 1.5 inches in depth, 4 inches wide, and 3 inches in height, with a 3 inch lens extension outward when in full zoom.  There is a mic pickup on the face, and a small speaker output on the top left of the camera.  On the top right we have a small power on/off button, a toggle in/out and snap button, a flash on/off button, and macro and timer buttons as well.  The camera looks slightly smaller in person than in pictures.  The body is made of plastic, aswell as the toggle switch.  All of which feel kind of cheap.  There is a program selection wheel on the top, and a color 2.5 inch lcd screen on the back along with four small function buttons running vertically along the lcd screen (delete, menu, info, and toggle camera / playback button).  On the side we have a port for a 3 volt in ac to dc adapter, and a mini usb out port.  In terms of selectable modes, we have a scene selection, a panorama option, a setting for \"sports\", a \"smart capture\" position for simple automatic point-and-shoot, a video mode, a \"program\" option (let's you set aperature, iso, flash advance or delay), an \"aperture priority\" setting, a \"shutter priority\" option, and a \"manual\" position.  The \"smart capture\" setting is a pretty straight forward selection for those phototakers who don't want to mess with settings and lets the camera set them, essentially letting you just point and shoot.  My favorite option though is the \"scene\" selection.  Kodak has built in 17 settings under \"scene\" that help maximize your picture quality depending on various environments and lighting conditions.  I find my pictures turn out a little better than just on the \"smart capture\" mode here with the \"scene\" choices. The \"scene\" choices include High ISO (for low light situations), portrait, night portrait, landscape, night landscape, flower (for vivid pics of flowers in bright light), sunset, backlight (for photos where light in behind the subject), candle light, manner / museum (where camera sound and flash are not desired), text (taking photos of documents), beach (bright situations), snow (bright white backgrounds), fireworks (displays of vivid bright night colors), children (playing in bright situations), self-portrait, and stage (for people on stage, less blur, more brightness, and no flash).  The camera doesn't have a true wide-angle position, but under the \"panorama\" setting there is the ability to take a 3 stage set of pictures from left to right, or right to left, and the camera binds all 3 pics (or \"stitches\" them together) for a wide-angle effect pic.  This is truly amazing and I've seen anything like it.  I've managed to put some fantastic panoramic pics together of some breathtaking landscapes with this option!  In the \"menu\" selection, we have 2 options for \"capture\" and \"tool\" settings.  Here we can adjust picture size from 10 MP (4:3), 8.9 MP (3:2), 7.5 MP (16:9), 5.0 MP (4:3), 3.1 MP (4:3), 2.2 MP (3:2), and finally 2.1 MP (16:9).  An excellent wide selection of picture resolution choices!  Under \"tools\" we can select the color mode (natural, high color, low color, sepia, and b&w;).  We can turn on or off the face detection option, set automatic focus to single or continuous, and set the LCD brightness.  Additional selections include image grid, red-eye reduction, date and time stamp, image stabilization, quickview, camera sounds, video out (NTSC or PAL), image storage (memory card, internal 32 mb only, or both using internal as backup for the memory card).  We also have language, reset, and format selections as well.  In terms of taking pictures and video, I find it's always best to know you're working environment and being able to fine tune the options on the camera for best photo and video quality.  Don't get me wrong, the simple \"smart capture\" mode works fine, but you can squeeze out some incredibly impressive photos from this little digital cam if you know how to get your settings right.  It's really something that comes with experimentation and experience.  The macro mode works well even though there has been some negative feedback about it here on Amazon.  Ideally, anywhere you have bad lighting, the macro focus won't focus, and you'll have bad pics.  I've managed to take some neat close=ups of flowers and other things at distances of about 3 inches, but anything closer causes the focus to blur.  The video is pretty crisp and sounds decent, but keep in mind it's at 640x480, so don't expect HD quality here.  Still, a nice little option for those moments you don't want to miss the \"live\" moments.  The use of a pair of regular AA batteries is excellent.  I don't understand why some people don't like using AA batteries?  A pair of high-powered ni-mh batteries will keep this camera running for hours under video mode, and lets you take hundreds of photos before needing recharging.  And if you're out on the road with no recharger, there's almost always somewhere you can go to pick up a set of alkalines for those occasions you need to get back to taking photos quickly.  The memory card slot accepts the largest card I have (32 gig) and when you're ready to view your photos is simple to remove and place in my laptop card reader or usb cardreader port on my dvd player.  A couple small things that i don't like include the fact that the LCD is hard to view in bright light and it's resolution is pretty basic, but don't let the pics on the LCD fool you, when you blow them up on your monitor many of them look incredible.  I've decided to keep this camera.  Why?  It makes my Canon A590 Powershot pocket cam perform like a dinosaur.  The Canon's pics look flat, hazy, and dull compared to the Kodak's.  I've taken both to the park and put them head to head.  The picture quality (resolution) of the Kodak, zoom capability, and video is just that much better than the Canon (I never would have thought that about a Kodak versus a Canon) condisering both cameras were released at about the same time (2007/2008).  So if you're looking for a VERY versatile pocket cam that takes great pics and good video at a price that won't break the bank, I highly recommend this Kodak Z915.

This camera follows that mantra with easy to read and use buttons, and a setting dial on the top which makes switching between shooting modes simple. This type of camera, a high zoom with expanded shooting modes than a point and shoot, while still having the point and shoot philosophy so a early user to digital cameras or even a seasoned photographer can find ways to capture their pictures the best.What Kodak does so well also is something that sets it lower than what Sony H20, Canon SX120 IS, and Nikon L20 have in the class the Z915 is trying to enter. All of the other cameras feature better image quality, more custom modes where white balance, shutter speed, flash levels, ISO levels, and focal distance points are more expanded than what's offered in the Kodak. Also, the time between pictures on the Kodak is noticeably longer than the Sony, Canon, and Nikon. While many may not see that as a make or break when deciding on a camera, the wait time can be annoying for others.The Kodak does make a compelling case in the in-between segment of point and shoot, and having some settings DSLRs were exclusive to.

It is better than my more expensive SLR bought just three years ago, she'd better watch out.  Despite her aversion to mechanical devices and reading instructions, she's off and running in a photography class.  Two excursions downtown this weekend, and she's already snapped 700 pictures and posted on Facebook (and gotten compliments for) at least 60 shots.This camera has the combination of moderate price, 10X zoom, fast exposure and focus, image stabilization, 10 megapixels, and ease of use that I sought.

I have not had a camera since the \"film\" days. About 4 months ago, I discovered super zoom cameras on TV and began to look into them. I took a liking to the Panasonic zx3 because it would fit into the pocket and had a long zoom. I was saving up to buy one but wanted to examine at least one other camera in the same category.  Then I found the Kodak Z915. I knew it was slightly larger and actually had to hope that it would fit in my pocket. It does fit in my shirt pocket. At that time, I was saving to buy the ZX3. The Z915 already fit my wallet. It is $100 less than the ZX3. That's nice. I bought the Z915 about 2 weeks ago. Also, as I mentioned above, I haven't used a camera in quite a while. Now with this camera in my pocket, everything is a potential picture. The auto mode is quick; I can take this camera out, push the ON button, zoom to what I want, push the Shoot button half way until green focus box, and click it. This can comfortably take about 5 seconds. Finally it is good for learning. This camera has enough modes that I will be learning how to use them for quite some time. When I put my 4 gig data card in the camera shows that I have about 1200 pictures left. I have a whole bunch of aa batteries but regular batteries only last for about an hour and a half or so of shooting and fiddling with the pictures.

Crawford", "ReviewID": "RDOBI5IDT5GDY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent quality, high zoom, very lightweight, easy to carry, Kodak camera for a bargain basement price. How anyone who knows anything at all about photography, including beginners, can not get a good pic out of this model camera is beyond me. The fact that it also has a nice, in camera stitch feature, for panoramic scenes up to 3 panels wide makes it an even better deal.  But, first, let's address some of the myths created by those that rated this cam with only a 1 or 2 star rating.\"Cam comes with very poor manual.\" Gee, do you think you might take 5 minutes and download the extended user's manual for this specific model and actually STUDY or at least READ it, if you can not figure this cam out on your own. It has an internal guideline system for even beginners built on the menu system, but still may be too much for some to digest and actually use._ _ _ _  \" It eats batteries like nothing I have ever seen.\"  Amazing. They ALL use up and drain non-rechargeable batteries quickly. Buy a good set of rechargeable batteries like Eneloops and this problem is solved.  _ _ _ _  \"The video sound is extremely muted.\"  Take your finger or thumb off the microphone. If you looked at the diagram supplied,you would know where it is, and it is very easy to cover it up without realizing it.  _ _ _ _  \"The quality of the photos is mixed, and it takes very poor pics indoors.\"  Odd, when you are consistent, using good standard practices, you can obtainconsistently good results. The ONLY thing causing mixed results, is the inconsistent actions of the user.Regarding the poor pics indoors or in low light conditions, the vast majority of cams with sensors as smallas standard point and shoots are going to perform in a mediocre manner. This one performs no worse than several on the market that are far more expensive.  _ _ _ _  \"This cam is all plastic and feels like it would break easily if dropped.\"  News Flash! Even a high quality all metal expensive cam may have the lens damaged by asingle drop, and be made non operational. DO NOT DROP IT!!!  _ _ _ _  The list goes on, and I will not bother addressing the rest of the comedy acts from fantasy land. Go to dpreview, or just look on this site at some of the examples of the photos taken. This is a VERY LOW PRICED budget cam that can often be obtained for around $100, and sometimes less than that. Out of all these whiners, complainers, moaners, and groaners, only a single one recommended something else by name, that he thought was better in the same price range. BUT, when I looked up that model, not only did it cost a minimum of $60 more, but it was not 10X. It was either 3 or 4X zoom putting it in an entirely different category, and it had some weaknesses I have not seen on this model at all.  The Kodak Z915 has 10X optical zoom, with 5X advanced digital zoom, for a total combined zoom capability of 50X. For such an inexpensive camera, while not perfect it is quite capable. It also has a quick turn around time in between shots, and overall works surprisingly well.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bang for the buck!", "Author": "Picture Taker", "ReviewID": "R2WD3JT4YS85T8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak is back!

When I received it, the red color made it look very cheap, almost like a disposable camera, so I returned it.  I didn't even bother trying the camera out.Fast forward to last month.  This was a Gold Box Deal and the price was (and still is) pretty good for the bundle (the bundle comes with the case, rechargeable AA batteries and charger)--by the way, don't get the batteries confused - they also include the regular alkaline AA batteries - don't accidentally stick those in the charger like I almost did!I took a chance on the black camera this time and I'm still on the fence about keeping it.  I think the black color makes it look  more expensive than a disposable, but the plastic seems very thin compared to other cameras I own.  Time will tell on how rugged it is, since there were a couple superficial scratches on it the first time I took it out of the box...what happens after I use it for awhile - how many scratches will this get? I take very good care of my cameras but this camera body is so chintzy.Easy to use without reading the instruction manual - and if you do need help, part of the manual is stored on-board - just press the button on the back of the camera.  It takes incredible pictures, even better than an expensive Fuji camera I used to own.  You can include the date on the picture, something I had to add  myself  with software with any of my Fuji's.  I'm not sure about Nikon, but I think Canon is the only other camera manufacturer where you can include the date on the picture.The shutter lag time is fast enough.  I rarely miss a shot while waiting on the shutter to respond whether it be with flash or without. BUT---Kodak's way of doing the picture preview after taking a shot leaves a lot to be desired.  It's called QuickView.  You have a choice of it being \"off\", \"5 seconds\", or \"10 seconds\" - meaning after you take your shot, the picture will preview for 5 seconds or 10 seconds. I *really* hate this feature, a 2 second picture preview is enough time to check and see if the picture is OK.  I don't need 5 or 10 seconds - your only choices besides \"off\".However, with this \"QuickView\" feature which really isn't quick - there is a small paragraph in the manual which says you can lightly touch the shutter button and you can then go on to taking the next picture.  I completely skimmed over this the first time I read the online manual.  Kodak needs to put this in bolder type so it's more easily noticed.  I assume all Kodak cameras are this way, but I still don't like the way this operates.The two AA rechargeable batteries last about 180 pictures for me.  But I tend to leave my camera on most of the time and let it shut off on its own.There are also very few cameras in this price range where you can have full manual control should you want to - you can set your own aperture, shutter speed, flash compensation and ISO.And even though the movies are not HD quality, they are quite acceptable for uploading to YouTube.This camera was released over a year ago, and that's the reason for the price drop.  I am also currently checking out the Z950 Kodak EasyShare Z950 12 MP Digital Camera (Black) with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD which was released about the same time as the Z915, but has 12 MP instead of 10, has HD video, and is slightly more expensive.  I will post a review on the Z950 soon.My complaints and the reason I'm giving this camera 4 stars instead of 5:  The battery compartment cover is flimsy and I know it will break eventually.  The camera body is easily scratched on the shiny surfaces.  And I'm not all that impressed with the distance for macro shots.  I end up compensating on this by taking the shot from a farther distance than 5\" on the highest MP setting and then cropping it down.  I've also had some trouble with shutting the macro off - I press the button on top and it gets stuck on the macro setting. And also that 5 second picture preview (called Quickview).  This may be a deal-breaker for me, I haven't yet decided if I'm returning it.One thing you have to watch out for with this camera:  The camera's speaker is located on the top left, where you'd normally hold onto the camera with your left hand.  I happen to like to hear the beeps and shutter noises, etc., and I have to constantly make myself aware of the location of my left hand when holding the camera.  And even then, the volume, when set on high, is not very loud at all.This camera has SOME internal memory but certainly not enough for taking any more than 2 or 3 pictures; I highly recommend getting a MINIMUM Class 6 SDHC card.  Make sure it's at least a Class 6, preferably a class 10, so you will have the fastest response time.  I can pretty much guarantee you won't be happy with a slow SD card.February 23, 2011 - Edited to Add this:  This camera is NOT worth the money at the price it is now, look for a newer Kodak model and the price will be cheaper with better features more than likely.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "best gift she ever got.", "Author": "G.

It was very easy to use right out of the box.  I just put the dial on the \"Smart Capture\" setting and started shooting away.  It does take a second or two for the camera to recognize the setting you are in but it's not overly slow.  One of the best features of the camera is how quickly it captures the pictures.  What I mean by that is when you press the shoot button, it captures the picture almost instantaneously.  The other cameras I have owned had a slight delay which caused some bad pics at times.The picture and video quality on the Z915 is very sharp.  I spent all week taking pictures and videos.  When I finally had it hooked up to the tv, the pics and vids came out very nicely.  It was very sharp and the colors came through beautifully.  The only negative thing about the camera is the size.

These are just my thoughts, I hope they might help a little. Pros: 10x optical zoom with a sharp lens and good image stabilization . It shoots fast, shot to shot is 1 to 1.5 sec with out the flash and about 2 to 2.5 sec with the flash, start up time is about 2 sec.( start-up is the same as my canon SX110 ). You do not have to remember to raise the flash and it is in a nice spot on the camera.Cons: No camera is perfect at this price point. Heads up here you do not get a SD card and no A/V cable comes with the camera.* These are just my thoughts,... The camera has a nice solid feel to it, it just feels like a real camera in your hands, you can get a good grip on it. Just about the same size as the canon SX110. I would give it a 7 out of a 10 on picture quality. As point and shoots get better we often try and compare them to digital SLRs (speed, ISOs, picture quality)so I think a 7 out of a 10 is very good for a point and shoot...  A lot of the review sites blow there pictures way up and look for defects, your likely to only make 5x7 or 8x10s and not see (what they see).It makes a great vacation camera or a good on a budget family camera ( Very easy to use, large zoom and fast picture taking ). It does seem that the Z915 gets more red eye in my grandkids pictures than I would like, that just me though...(I seem to have better luck with the (preflash) than the (digital correction). It has a really flimsy plastic cover over the usb - av cable ports. I use a SD card reader to down load my pictures. I have noticed that the mode dial has moved by accident from one mode to another because it is just a tad to loose, but on the other hand it makes it easy to turn when holding it with just the one hand... I use program mode a lot and keep the ISO  to 100 ( or I use AUTO ISO in program mode ) to keep the noise down and for the sharpest picture. I have used portrait mode and the camera used 64 iso indoors and the picture looked very sharp. It's just me thinking out loud but I think these do it all auto modes slow the camera down a tad ( focus time - shot to shot time ) and auto indoors wants to use a higher ISOs (like my canons)  and that makes for to much noise in the picture (for me), try to stay at 200 or lower and 400 is stretching it but see the pictures at cabela's I took at 400iso,they came out very good.  If auto works good for you use it but don't let the iso get to high... ( NOTE portrait mode so far has used 64iso every time I have used it indoors or out).  There are some great looking pictures posted on this site using auto mode with this camera, check them out if you have time...Another thing you can try to help focus faster is to use center-zone focas instead of multi-zone. Sometimes I set the color mode to low color and like what I see sense kodak colors are so vivid anyway, just something you could try if your pictures look over processed(over done,to vivid) to fine tune your picture if you wanted.  This camera is also called a ZD15 in some stores and it will be the same camera.UPDATE 7/24/10 this morning I used program mode and the ISO was set to ( AUTO ISO ) and the camera was taking pictures at 64iso, they came out very sharp and the sports mode was using 200iso which was making for  nice pictures and doing it very quickly. And also taking grand kid pictures and other pictures using ( AUTO ISO )indoors in program mode it was using (200iso with the flash)  where my newer canons want to use 640 iso indoors, I have to say they looked very sharp at 200. With out the flash it was just using 400iso (in auto iso) while using program mode, Thats pretty good... I use energizer AA lithium batteries or 2500-2900 NI-mAH rechargeables. I just use the lithium batteries for vacation or  hloidays,  for just every day shooting I use the rechargeables. * You would not be happy with standerd AA batteries... Again, you do not get a SD card with the camera ), a 4gb card class 4 or class 6 would be a good place to start if your going to use the movie mode any at all ), you could get by with a 2gb if not using the video mode.I rate the 2.5inch LCD a 7 out of a 10 it could be a little bigger and a lot brighter but it does good in all but the brightest sun. It has 5 levels of brightness adjustments. Note that the LCD screen also dims to level 1 adjustment after 7 seconds in any shooting mode until you push any button and if you do nothing for 7 sec again it will dim again  to save the battery... This might help if your waiting to long on the quick view to go off (it takes 5 secs) and you want to get that next shot, push the shutter button 1/2 down and it will go off and focus on your next picture, you do not have to waite the full 5secs.  Canon has a 2 second review or quick view setting which is nice. I mostly keep my quick view turned off again thats just me though...I set the  disp overlay to grid lines to help take a straighter picture, You may use it for the 1/3 rule also).( Kodak calls it-capture frame grid, set to on ).If your new to this digital camera stuff remember to low level format the SD card ((save your pictures first, doing this will also erase the pictures)).Just noticed this, while taking a picture go into (scn mode)then choose landscape, take your picture and check (properties in your computer), it chose to use sharp in the sharpness setting in stead of the normal setting (for a distant picture) it new to use more sharpness in that mode ,impressive...The lowepro ( Apex 60 AW ) is a really  nice camera case for the Z915. **Check out the pictures for the Z915 on this site to get a idea how some of the options and pictures would look for you.

Also there are 7 other positions for Manual mode, Shutter Priority Mode, Aperture Priority Mode, Exposition Progam, Movement Shots, Preset SCENES (museum, Night Shots, Portraits. . . . etc), Video and the good old composite panoramic shot included in my old Kodak (this is a neat feature, Take three or two shots and stich them on a expectacular wide panoramic photo)As I expected the image quality its superior than my older digital camera, however in some cases, specially indoors or low lighted areas the edges of contrast areas are very noisy (not a little, sometimes it is a lot) But as I learned to use the advance features of the camera, I use exposure modes and even the preset scenic modes to correct these shots.The Zoom and Lenses are excelent, the Tele - Wide control has a little of a delay of response at first, but still VERY GOOD and Stable, The Face detection and movement control are good. Most of the shots taken are sharp and Focused, even in long Zoomed pictures.Image Color as most of Kodak Digital Cameras, Is SUPERGOOD! the Daylight pictures are Clear, Crisp and Bright.I have not use continuos shooting mode ( as I read it only takes 3 shots), But I liked to take more than 1 picture of most portrait (or people) photos, so later on my PC I can review and select the best one.

Most still or posed shots came out great, no real touch-up required - however, the auto-focus takes some time to lock in and for action shots it was extremely difficult to get good usable photos - they were very blurry and it seems the auto-sensing scene selector did not choose a high enough ISO for me.  It would also be nice if the camera were a bit smaller - while this camera is by no means as large as a DSLR, it is still a fair bit larger than most compact cameras, and will just barely fit in most pants pockets, but not very comfortably.  The camera body also has a somewhat cheap non-solid feel which makes me think that the first accidental drop will end up being its last - not that I plan on dropping it, of course, but still...Bottom line: I am happy with my purchase. It meets my requirements pretty well and should fit most budget.  While it is priced similarly to other budget cameras, its features clearly put it in front of all of them.  I would recommend this camera to my friends or colleagues.P.S. The Lowepro Rezo 50 case is a great fit for this camera -- very small but not tight at all, while also allowing room for spare batteries and a spare SD card.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Buy for the money", "Author": "Floor Guy", "ReviewID": "R16VOR0OV6E0XN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a real estate appraiser & need a camera for everyday use, as well as family trips, etc. While I am not a camera expert or formal critic  I wanted a camera this time that had a good optical lens, but that would not fall apart after daily use & wouldn't break the bank. The Kodak works fine. Very easy to use and takes great shots. The only problem, & it is probably more me than the camera, is that the dial on the top of the camera that switches between the different modes does not stay in place after being removed from my pocket so I have taken a lot of videos with funny dialogs when I wanted to take a photo.  I must say the unwanted videos are also of a good quality. It fits in my pants pocket well enough and has not yet shown much wear & tear after being tossed into the car or placed into my briefcase.

Every other digital camera that I have ever used, even third world knockoffs, would open as a device under \"My Computer\" when jacked into a USB port. Not this baby.Two minor issues.  It is difficult to seat the USB cable into the camera jack because the rubber port cover interferes.  Or maybe mine came with a flaky cable.  Either way, it took more than an hour and three annoying text chats with technical support to solve this problem.  Also, the shutter that covers the lens is delicate and flimsy.

You are FORCED to either load the (very) crummy Easy Share software on your computer (or some other picture grabbing software), and use that as your interface, or yank the card out of the camera and plug it into a reader. Having had cameras in the past where the battery door broke, (and that is where SD card is), I am very leery of constantly having to access this compartment. I'm also definitely NOT getting those clear crisp pictures that other owners seem to get. I had a Nikon Coolpix 2100 that did better in some cases. This video is very good, as long as you don't try to zoom while taking the video. Talk about blurry, until it settles back into focus.

Mallinson", "ReviewID": "R3O9P743O00KHV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been itching for a new digital camera for a long time.  And when I say long, I mean an ice age.  My last new camera was a 3 MP unit purchased in the summer of 2003 before I took an eight-month trip abroad.  Needless to say, I make things last and I'll never be the saviour of a consumer-driven economy.My in-laws came to visit from Europe this past June, and while I'd been agitating with my wife to get a new camera to chronicle their first visit to America, I couldn't overcome her base-level skin-flintiness.  Then when the in-laws arrived, a ray of hope emerged.  My wife's grandmother had sent to each of us a little cash present.  Not feeling constrained to answer to my wife in the use of MY present, I surfed the webs and picked up this camera refurbished from B&H.;My wife was...  unimpressed.  Actually, angry was a better way to put it.  See, while our old camera was approaching the level of a piece of junk, regardless, my wife always imagined that our next camera would be a fancy DSLR job, since we'd borrowed one before and enjoyed it, and we'd also just helped her parents pick one up for her brother, who's on his way to being a professional photographer.  She said that there was no point to buying an ordinary point-and-shoot because 1) we never took pictures and 2) better to wait and buy a fancy DSLR.  My retort was that 1) we never took pictures anymore because the old camera was such a pain to use and 2) it will never make sense to get a DSLR because we'd never really need that much camera.  Needless to say, the night after I bought the Kodak Z915, we went to bed angry.Then she used it.Now, my wife and I can't be blamed for being blown away with any new piece of digital photography kit, given how long we suffered under the yoke of outdated technology.  I'm sure the high shutter speed and pixel density wouldn't make as great an impression on someone whose camera is only 2-3 years old.  And I don't doubt that there are better units out there than the Z915 to be had for not many more bucks than we spent.  Having used a DSLR for a whole vacation, I can tell you that for your average user, this camera will bring you about as close as any non-professional or serious hobbyist really needs.  The image stabilization is really quite incredible; the photos I took from the upper deck of a moving ferry to Mackinac Island on a blustery day were gorgeous.  I leaned towards this unit because of Kodak's reputation for punchy colors, and I wasn't disappointed.  It does veer a little close to looking surreal, but the photos I took of the gardens of Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago and on New York City's High Line Park are rich and varied.  That caters to my tastes, and I won't apologize for it.  All the other little things are there - a pretty intelligent automatic setting, nice scene settings for everything from close-ups and portraits to landscapes and sunsets, 10x zoom, fast transfers to your home computer.  You know the drill.  It covers everything quite well.  And let's be realistic, people, as much as the camera companies are trying to guilt you into moving on from your older cameras with newer models sporting 12 MP, nobody needs that many.  Heck, most of us don't need 10 MP.  In fact, on the hunt that eventually resulted in my buying the Kodak Z915, I limited my search to cameras between 7 and 10 MPComplaints about the design and build are not entirely out of line.  The plastic does feel a touch on the cheap side.  I'm not opposed to having a camera that evokes the feel of the simple pocket cameras of my youth, but still this does have a toyish feel.  And the screen-only viewfinder is a bit frustrating when reviewing the photos you've taken.  Even my old Nikon felt like it gave me a better idea about the quality of the photos on the card.  That's just a word of warning - this camera takes BEAUTIFUL pictures, but you won't appreciate them at all until you've seen them on your home computer or printed them out.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for the Beginning Hobbyist Who Wants to Learn More", "Author": "Linda S.

I adore taking close-up pictures of things, and while this camera can do close-ups, the close-up pictures don't always come out looking great.  Sometimes, you get lucky and they do come out great, but I want something that can get very, very close-up pictures without really having to work at it.Otherwise, this is a really great camera and I've not really had any problems with it.

Now, let me say that the image quality of this camera is the worst. Initially, I had a focus problem - and had to send it to Kodak repair(what a joke) twice to \"repair\" that problem. Each time that cost me at least $10. The image is \"thin\", meaning that it has no \"body\" or depth that can be manipulated with a image editor except in the slightest(and I do mean slightest) way. When enlarging or cropping an image you will see the noise and the \"blotchy\" way that the picture and color are constructed. This is the noisiest camera I have ever used - second to none. I previously purchased a Kodak CX7530 and it was by far a better camera with a much better image, with only 5MP. It had a CCD sensor, the Z915 has a cheap CMOS, which is truely inferior in every way - there is no way the Z915 is an upgrade even though it boasts 10MP. The last time I was on the phone to Kodak \"customer no service\" for over 40 minutes - and they told me that my problems would all be solved if I set the dial to the choice with the red lettering - what a waste of my time.

But I'm so happy with this one I may not ever trade up.The zoom is enormous (10X) for a camera of this type.  I took a lot of pictures at an indoor swim meet on \"no flash\" and they turned out great.  One of my big concerns is shutter lag and I don't notice any at all with this camera: it takes great action shots.  It has \"image stabilization\" and I think that helps, too.  It's a little slower (a few seconds) than my previous Panasonic to initially turn on; but once it's on it recycles quickly.I specifically chose this model because it takes AA batteries so I don't have to worry about being out camping with no power to recharge a proprietary battery, e.g., or having it die on me.  I use rechargeables and they seem to last a long time; but I also carry around a couple of Alkaline spares \"just in case.\"I didn't realize before I bought it that this camera also has a totally manual setting.  If I understood what I was doing, I could set the aperture, shutter, iso, etc. individually.  That gives me some motivation to learn more.  But the \"Smart\" setting - letting the camera choose - has really been great.  I've also tried the sports, sunset and low light settings so far with terrific results.  I have had fun playing with the Panorama setting (new to me - it \"stitches\" 2 or 3 pictures to yield one wide one) and I think the \"Manners\" setting (for museums or other environments where you don't want flash or sounds) is also a great idea, too.  I like that a quick explanation comes up on the screen so I can quickly flip through the icons to find what I want.  The screen is surprisingly visible even in bright sun - that was a pleasant change from just having to \"guess\" whenever I was in the sun.Moving from a Panasonic to a Kodak means, after only 6 weeks, I'm still in the learning curve but I am extremely happy with the pictures and ease of use of this camera.  It's a little large compared to the very compact ones that are out now, but it has a nice feel in my hand; it still fits nicely in a jacket or sweater pocket and I happily traded the slightly larger size for the convenience of the AA batteries and the ease of handling.I have not used the software at all yet - I know that \"old\" Kodak software was awful but I can't speak to the new versions.  I just remove the SD card and pop it in my card reader so I haven't even installed the software that came with it.  I know that there is a certain amount of editing I can do right on the camera, but I haven't tried that yet either.So far I have no regrets and I am totally impressed with how much camera I got for such a reasonable cost!", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera/Video Recorder at decent price", "Author": "Garry Engelberg", "ReviewID": "RTE2X6OIXEOBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent price for a  decent camera, not one a pro would use I'm sure but for me it is trul;y wonderful", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera; great price.", "Author": "Barbara J.

They both work good so I wasn't in the market for a new camera, unless a great deal came along.If I was to get a new camera it would have to be one with more zoom without spending $200+. I found a deal on the Kodak Z915 - it was $105.00 which included a $25.00 gift card. (Pretty Cheap!) It was actually cheaper than either of my current cameras.Because it actually cost less than the cameras I have now I wanted to do a comparison.I took a dozen indoor pictures with each camera from the same spot. All the cameras were set to \"AUTO\" mode and all the pictures were printed out at a Photo Kiosk.The Kodak Z915 produced good pictures, some of the pictures from my old cameras came out better, because the Kodak Smart Capture Feature on the Z915 made some of the pictures yellowish or had over processed colors. I found that by switching the Kodak Z915 to the \"P\" mode and re-taking the yellowish pictures they came out as good as my old cameras.All the indoor zoomed pictures with the Kodak Z915 came out really nice. The zoomed pictures with my old cameras had a more grainy look. The Kodak Z915 must have a more powerful flash or better lens quality.The outdoor pictures with the Kodak Z915 came out really nice. The colors were reproduced very closely to the original,(set in \"P\" mode). Colors with my old cameras come out darker, not the same shade as the original.The zoom on this camera is REALLY nice, at full optical zoom there is good detail to the pictures. This was the main reason for getting this camera in the first place. Sometimes you just cant get close to the subject and having a 10x zoom will let you do this.Other notes:The Kodak Z915 uses two \"AA\" batteries. I use NIMH rechargeable ones that last for many pictures. This is nice because my other cameras have proprietary LION batteries that are expensive and require special chargers or cables connected to the camera to charge up. You can find \"AA\" batteries anywhere.The camera comes with Kodak's Easy Share Software. I never liked it and don't use it. There are better programs available, some for free.Overall I am happy with the Kodak Z915. It provided me with some pictures already that I would not of had with my old cameras!

The zoom capabilities are excellent.  We are also pleased with the fair quality of the videos it takes (considering it is a camera, after all).  If you are looking for professional quality, this camera probably isn't for you, but for regular everyday pictures that most families would want to take, this camera is excellent.The one *major* complaint I have with this camera is that not a single computer in our house recognizes it when we attach it to the USB port (and this is after downloading the driver software that comes with the camera). We tried it on an Acer windows laptop, my older MacBook, my newer MacBook pro, my husband's Dell in windows, my husband's Dell in Linux, our windows desktop, and our linux desktop.  Not once could we get it to recognize the d*mn camera (meanwhile we had a couple of excited kids jumping up and down who could hardly wait to print out a couple of the pictures).  Argghhh!My husband finally went to Walmart and bought a USB card reader, and that works.  We remove the card from the camera, insert it into the reader, and download the pictures that way.When 2 highly educated and very tech-savvy people in the house can't get the camera to connect to any of our large variety of computers, there is something seriously wrong with the driver software.

DesignCamera fits in hand very comfortable, easily can be hold by one hand. Design is simple, looks nice, note outfitted or ugly but not glamorous (if someone cares about :)).Plastic body looks very solid, even battery lid (and lid is common weakness of plastic body cameras).It is very compact and not heavy at all. Forget about hesitations like: Should you take your  500g and 500USD camera with you or not. :)2. Battery lifeAA battery is an advantage for me - available everywhere, easy to find, easy to replace. I have used VARTA NiCd rechargeable - about 100 pictures, many with flash, megazoom, up-to 3 short (3-5 min) videos...  With NiMH should perform better.3. LCDSome may say, that 2,5' is small... but it is very bright and vivid display. Even in sunlight you still see, what you shoot - that's very important as no additional viewfinder is available (my advice - keep LCD brightness to 5).4. Performance and shootingKodak Smart Capture generally works well, picture colors are vivid, in-camera processing using Kodak Perfect Touch can also help.  Automatic white balance is also intelligent, but what you may lack - manual WB feature. That's Con.Camera gives no option for JPEG compression you can adjust. It is done automatically. Some may lack that feature for sure.What would make you happy - PASM. Camera gives manual control over aperture, shutter, exposure compensation, flash light compensation. Bracketing function, metering...  But even in manual mode camera suggests best parameters and gives histogram indication in live mode. You can do your own, but non-advanced users may find that very useful. And such suggestions also may help you to understand better how various options may be used best and do reflect on pictures.Camera is fast - quickly turns on and ready to be used, shutter is very fast  as well, but auto focus is bit slow - you may help pressing the shutter slightly, what makes camera to focus.Megazoom, Macro mode and optical stabilization work great. You may get very cool pictures of far-away objects, shooting thru windows or fence (some photos are uploaded to Amazon - please, check).Camera is quite. Makes almost no noise. Very useful for shooting in certain conditions, quiet environment.Flash is also OK (and as said above additional compensation is manually adjustable).  Would enable you to make nice night portraits.5. MenuThis is simply great. Intuitive, easily understandable, gives various hints and explanations... Even if this is your first camera - no chances to be confused or lost.In ConclusionPlease, read features carefully before you make a purchase to know exactly what you would get. From my side I can tell that you definitely get more than enough for this price. Nothing is ideal, but I am not disappointed at all.Should probably add one thing - Camera shots, but that's photograph'r, who makes beautiful pictures.

I am photographer as a hobby and take several hundred pictures a month. It serves me well.Pros-The 10X zoom is wonderful. I often shoot nature, and it's great to be able to get \"close\" to whatever you're shooting.- Many of the controls are physical. Meaning, you don't have to dig through a bunch of menus to set up your shot-It's size is quite go for what it can do, it's not going to fit in every pocket, but it's still decently small.- AA batteries are nice instead of a proprietary rechargeable. SD cards are good function too.Cons-Contrary to it's name. I don't find it an \"easy-share.\" as it will only import pictures to it's kodak program. I use my old camera so I can import them without the program.-The flash isn't too great.-I really want a camera with a manual focus, as it can really be a pain to focus on EXACTLY what I want it to, most times it's ok though.-the video is kinda noisy (by noisy, I mean grainy, not loud) at times-the zoom could be faster. It probably takes 5 seconds to zoom all the way in and focusa minor note- the edges of the LCD screen have turned slightly yellow dosen't prevent me from using it at all it just scared me when it first showed upIn terms of value, this is a great buy.

Moore", "ReviewID": "R3PLQXCGSDLEA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was shopping for a megazoom or even low-end DSLR camera--but became convinced by the reviews that I should start with a much smaller investment.  Based on the same reviews, I learned that the Z915 was well-regarded as a \"large body\" but entry-level camera.  Based on having taken and downloaded about 300 pictures, I agree, and am very happy with my choice.My shopping produced a price of $104, delivered, no tax--and for the money, I don't think I could have done better.  The camera has all the essential features that I want to learn and experiment with, and I'll be a much more knowledgeable buyer when I move up to spend 5-10 times as much for a good DSLR.  I haven't yet used the video and sound functions, since I'm waiting for a large-capacity, high-speed storage chip, but expect that they'll be typical of the quality to be expected from low- to mid-range cameras.This camera is very easy to set up and use--the installation software worked like a charm, and I'm impressed by the Kodak customer support and convenience of sharing photographs.  With a 2GB card installed, it has capacity for more than 600 photos, and I like AA batteries; I use rechargeable lithium batteries, and these give me 200+ photo capacity if I don't use the flash too much.Picture quality isn't the best--it doesn't have the name-brand optics that you can find in the $200-$300 range, and it's not a fast optical/electronic combination--but for the money, and at my level of experience, it's certainly good enough for the uses I'll have for this camera.  When displayed on a monitor, vertical/parallel lines look jagged and crude (don't know yet whether this defect is as noticeable when printed at a reasonable size), and there's \"noise\" (graininess of image) in low-light or magnified pictures.  I gather that these are characteristic of non-DSLR cameras, to some degree, and my expectations weren't great.  If you don't \"push\" toward the limits, photos taken with the Z915 under ideal or good light/speed conditions are certainly acceptable.It seems to be built pretty solidly--the only concerns I have in this area are the battery/storage card cover, and the flexible \"flap\" coverings for the USB port and power cord sockets.  The flexible coverings, in particular, are almost certain to part company with the camera (I'll give it a year or so), and the battery cover would be very easy to jam or otherwise mangle and break.  However, I've seen similarly frail-looking closures on higher-priced cameras, so it's probably a common weakness and complaint.As an inexpensive way to start digital photography, I'd recommend this without reservation.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "the batteries are a p.i.a.", "Author": "A.

Upon reading the reviews(most are above 3 stars) I read that it was an easy camera to use, took great pictures, and did more then the \"standard\" digital camera's did. I also read the negative reviews and they never focused on just 1 area, it was either the focus was poor, battery life was way to short, could break if dropped only a couple on inches. So i bought it, waited my 4 days for it to arrive, i opened it up looked at the directions, put the batteries in, the memory card and turned it on. So i decided to take a picture of my dog so i used the zoom and zoomed in on her, the auto focus wouldn't focus so i reduced the zoom and it would say the same thing. So i snapped a photo and it turned out great! so i quickly went outside to take some pictures of the trees and other things around my yard.

I hooked it up, waited for my computer to read the device and once i was able to view the pictures i was surprised, out of ALL the pictures I had taken, only about 5 actual pictures showed up.

During the picture taking of my family the camera froze and became unresponsive at least 4 times, maybe 1 out of 10 pictures actually got saved and some of the indoor pictures turned out to dark because the \"auto\" setting thought it was better to not use flash. all in all, I don't even want to take pictures with this camera.

This \"feature\" is not described in any of the literature or instruction book that came with the camera and there is nothing you can do to bypass it. You can set the duration before the camera shuts off - up to 10 minutes. You can set the brightness of the display. But no matter what you set, the display dims after just 10 seconds. I tried to shoot pictures at an air show. By the time I found a plane in the viewfinder (bright sunny day) it went dim, so I had to fiddle with things to make it bright again, and the process was repeated. The manufacturer initially didn't acknowledge this built in time bomb - said I could set a menu to determine how long before the camera shut down to save batteries. But eventually they admitted that yes, the display dims after 10 seconds to save the batteries and there is no way to over ride it. I thought since I was buying through Amazon that the standard 30 day 100% refund policy would apply, but this sale was through one of their Amazon marketplace vendors who are allowed to charge up to 20% for restocking.

I always take a point-and-shoot camera with me to photo-journal the ride. over the year, other members expected me to take the pictures of the ride and posted on Kodak Gallery ([...]). Recently my Kodak Z1486IS (small and light enough to carry in the back pocket of the riding jersey) went out of service, so I searched the Internet for the best mega-zoom camera and after reading many reviews, I bought a Canon SX-20 ($369.99), thinking it will give me better pictures.The pictures taken by Canon SX-20 looked sharp enough on the monitor, but with the size and the weight of the camear, it was hard to use during the ride, so I was forced to look for another camera. I found Kodak Z915 at a local Staple, and with the clearance price of $45.95, it was a great deal.What really surprised me is that now I am taking photo classes at a local community college, and the resolution of the photos from Kodak Z915, when using Photoshop CS5 to enhanced the contrast or color balance, reads 480 pixels/inch vs. 180 pixels/inch of Canon SX-20. When I print the pictures at 30\" x 40\" (the largest size school's Chromira printer allowed), it is so sharp that the teacher thought I used a digital single-lens reflex camera. The print from my Canon SX-20 was so soft (low res) at 30\" x 40\", I was embarrassed to show the print to other members of the club.I am more than satisfied with Kodak Z915. As for others' complain of blurry pictures, I read and followed Kodak's manual (press the shutter button half way and wait for the green mark, once appeared on the LCD display, the camera has found the subject and it's in focus (page 4 of the manual explain this simple procedure to produce sharp pictures).I still take pictures with my Nikon F4 or Mamiya RB67 Pro-SD for serious projects, but for quick and easy day-to-day picture taking, I am totally convinced that Kodak Z915 is one of the best, for price and the print quality, out there.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "\"It's not the looks that really count.

Power to picture is under a second, so you can turn it on and still catch that once-in-a-lifetime moment before it's gone, the #1 reason I chose this. It's by far the fastest in its class. Unfortunately, I will probably have to buy a pricier SX20 for night shots and concerts, and it's pointless to carry two similar cameras.The camera is very light and just barely pocketable in a jacket, big plusses. The superzoom is very quick to telescope in retract, and pictures are of excellent quality at either end with very little fringing, distortion, or blurring. Details pop without as much of the characteristic Kodak smoothing and sharpening. The flash is quite powerful and often exposes perfectly as long as the focus is correct - but it can sometimes be too bright and wash out detail, especially around interesting lighting. It is possible to lower the flash power in manual mode.It's also easier on the batteries than the average camera. I have a cache of AA around all the time, but I so rarely run out of power on a shooting session that I hardly ever take them with me anymore. In the past I've had cameras that left me high and dry, but despite the Z915 only taking 2 AA I've only had that happen once. Then again, I rarely use it after dark like the others.The one thing it can't do is night shots - don't even bother taking it to a club. It's almost completely unable to autofocus or meter in the dark - a common problem with all of the Kodaks I've owned - and there's no manual focus to fix it. Worse if there's any fog or haze. 90% of dark shots will be blurry, under/overexposed, or had motion blur, always full of grain, and shot time also slows while it hunts for focus. Good luck getting anything at all without a flash. You can manually meter, but without a focus there isn't much point. In my experience, only cell phones are worse at this; all of the Kodaks I've had were much more reliable. Macro mode focus is also not particularly good.When it works, however, the focus graphics are handy, showing both the focus point and faces, and on review shows quite a bit of photo details that can help meter further pics better. Alternate shooting modes are very complete, High ISO is particularly useful in the shadows. Some folks might like that it has Myspace Mode (Self-portrait). I've never used the on-camera editing features.Overall, I'd say that as long as you don't need concert & club photos, this is a fantastic value for the money.

I have mixed feelings about the purchase. Of great importance, is that the picture quality is very good and it has a lot of optional manual settings.  The zoom is also better than my last camera.  But I don't like the fact that there is no viewfinder (but this is now the case with most cameras); videos come out shaky because it is hard to stabilize the camera, and when in bright sunlight or trying to take a video or picture of something that is moving, it is hard to do with just the LCD screen, and it eats up the batteries quickly if you don't keep shutting it off when not immediately in use.  Speaking of which the on/off button is tiny and is in front of the setting dial, so it is not easy to use.  The other buttons are just as small, but raised up slightly and more conveniently located.  The cover for the place to attach a usb cable is very flimsy, and it gets in the way of the plug, so that you have to keep pulling at the cover until the plug finally snaps in, and I am assuming the cover will eventually break off.  It is nice to have the charger, usb cable, and batteries provided, but the case is so small, it is essentially unusable; it won't fit anything other than the camera and sd card; there is no room for spare batteries!When there are videos to download to the computer, the camera software can't handle doing it by usb; it will appear to be making progress, but then will display error messages, and you won't be able to download any of the pictures taken after the video if using the usb. However, I found out that inserting the memory card into my laptop is a fast and easy way to transfer the videos and pictures.  You will need the latest QuickTime 7 program to view the videos (which is avaible free online).  But a major problem in my opinion is that these videos are not compatible with other programs or websites, so you will need a program to convert them (to AVI or MOV).  When I contacted Kodak about a conversion program, they said I should be able to find one free online, and them mentioned one site but could not guarantee that it was safe (free of viruses or spyware, etc).  And it turns out the site they mentioned was not a free program, you could download it for free but if you didn't register and pay $$ there would be a large watermark in the middle of the video saying it was unregistered. So I decided to upgrade QuickTime 7 to the Pro version for an additional $30.

When I called Kodak, they just ran be through the menu and said their was nothing they could do.  Shame on you Kodak.  I had to send it back to the Amazon Marketplace seller to have them exchange it. The new camera is the same as the old.  I wouldn't purchase this camera again, and it is too much of a hassle to keep sending it back -- for what?

I did research before my purchase and I got the impression this was a great point and shoot camera, which is exactly what I wanted.  I never thought it took good pictures, most of them were grainy.  I called and talked to Kodak customer service & they said the only way to get better pics was to manually focus it every time, and mess with the settings, which is great if you are into photography, not so great if you are trying to catch a cute pic of your energetic 3-year-old.  So after 6 months of forcing myself to use my \"new\" camera, I finally accepted that I hated it, sold it used online, and went back to using my 8-year-old Olympus digital camera that is still easier to use and takes better pics than my \"new\" Kodak.I hated this camera so much that I will probably never buy another one, I found it not very user friendly and the pic quality was not all that great.

I saw this camera package on sale shortly before I went on vacation and wanted it on my vacation so I paid for the 3-day shipping. That was money well-spent! I am amazed(and so are others who have seen the pictures) at how well this camera takes pictures! I was really impressed with the zoom. To compare a regular shot with a zoomed shot, I took a regular shot of Haystack Rock in OR, and then zoomed in on a bird that was sitting on it. Where you could barely see that there was a bird in the regular shot, you could almost see the individual feathers in the zoomed shot! The layout of the buttons is also very well done. There is a dedicated button right next to the shutter to turn off the flash (but does not intefere with taking a picture). Just below it is a button that aids in shooting close-up shots, very nicely indeed. On the back of the camera are the delete, setup, info (help), and review buttons. If you take a picture and don't like how it looks, you can easily push the delete button and get rid of it. Even though there is a nice-sized viewer on the back, I did not find this camera eating batteries. There are so many number of preset ways to take a shot that I haven't explored them all yet, but I do like the Sport setting and the Panorama setting which allows you to take three pictures and then it threads them together very nicely for you.As noted earlier, there are several presets that will help any photographer take a good shot. I haven't explored them all yet, but I have been impressed with the ones I have! I haven't tried out the transfer because I just pop out the micro-SD card, pop it into a reader, and transfer them that way.

Still has all the great Kodak features, but unfortunately doesn't take the Kodak dual rechargeable battery packs that we already had. (two NiMH AA batteries attached to each other) It instead requires 2 separate AA batteries. We can still get rechargeable ones of those, and plan to, but I wish it had specified in the description that it ONLY takes separate batteries.  I have 4 sets of the other battery packs! However, I can still use my Kodak charger when I get the new batteries, and I can always use the regular AA ones in a pinch.  My fault for \"assuming\" that because it took AA size NiMH batteries I could use what I already had.The \"smart capture\" feature works OK, but gets blurry with any movement, so I am using the sport setting a LOT since my son is 20 months old.  The Z1285 \"smart scene\" feature was much more reliable, but again, this z915 camera is a lesser, older, cheaper model so I have to keep that in mind.Overall I gave it a 4 star rating because it came as advertised, worked great out of the box, is fully compatible with my easyshare software and printer, and we got some GREAT outdoor shots the first day I used it.

Having a 10x optical zoom was one of the major reasons I purchased this camera. You won't find that in competitors at a similar price. As far as picture quality goes, it is fine for what I need it for, an improvement over my last model, but still lags behind Canon. Megapixels are not the only important factor in crisp pictures.

All the indoor photos have a lot of noise, are unfocused, and look pixelated along the edges of bright colors. I've owned two other digital cameras and never had this problem (other brands besides Kodak). I chose this camera because all reviews said it's quick recovery between photos and that's true. Just don't take indoor photos. Outdoor photos seem better but still any lines look pixelated and distorted. I wouldn't say outdoor photos are fuzzy - they're quite sharp. But almost too sharp when lines or words are in the photos.I think part of the problem is that the flash is not bright enough so the camera compensates by putting noise into it. These were taken on normal exposure and on the point and shoot setting. On other settings or on close-ups the noise wasn't quite as noticable, but focus tended to be an issue if the room was somewhat dark. I was disappointed there was no way to adjust the flash brightness like on a Canon P&S; I used to own.The other thing I noticed is the barrel effect. I took some photos down a narrow hallway with this camera and my very old Sony Cybershot. This camera really made the walls bend!

We took a few short video clips as we used that feature extensively on our last camera (Canon). We took four and ALL FOUR of them were fuzzy, bad quality.

Even my 6mb Samsung point and shot takes better photos. Pictures cannot be read in your PC without installing the whole Easyshare software, which I did not do because it makes conflict with alternate picture software that I prefer. Your LCD TV via USB port won't read it while connected with the kodak USB cable. This problem does not exist with my Sony and Samsung. But the worst problem is that every memory card ever used in the camera can never be read in any other place. It's like the camera formats the card, so the only way to read the pictures is via the Kodak cable and having installed the whole Easyshare. It makes me feel like I'm a slave to Kodak. I wrote to Kodak support and they sent me a guide to read the photos in the PC using Windows Imaging Acquisition (WIA) driver. It's a 15 steps techie guide that I will not apply.

I put the camera to the test - took wide angle photos, zoom, video, macro, low-light - flowers and dogs (my newly adopted southern belle - Tara). At first the camera took great pictures. I liked the rechargeable batteries interchangeable with regular batteries. Nice photos- good video - good image stabilization. The rechargeable battery drained within a day - which didn't seem odd since I was using the initial charge they came with. The next session I took outside photos of flowers using various manual & preset settings. They were okay but not great. Some were out of focus, poor light metering or shutter speed. Again the battery drained after this session. At this point I switched to brand new Rayovac AA batteries.  Today an assortment of photos and again the photos were not great and the batteries drained very quickly.  After the 1st camera use I noticed a faint 'electronic burning smell'. This odor got worse everytime I used the camera.At this point I was concerned the camera was defective so I started the return process. I wasn't sure whether it was defective or just a bad camera until I packed the camera a week later. A white powder substance coated the battery area - inside and outside.

I haven't had a problem seeing the lcd in the bright sun like some other people said in their reviews.  The digital camera batteries that the camera came with (kodak brand) lasted for about 250 pictures zooming and taking movies and everything, but the rechargeable batteries that it came with only lasted about 75 pictures.

Unfortunatly, the indoor pictures are very poor quality. If the flash is always used indoors, the pictures may be too bright and washed out. If the subject is far enough away, the pictures are OK but not good. If the flash isn't used because of sufficient lighting, the pictures are blurry and fuzzy. They do not pick up detail and you'll wish you bought another brand. Kodak should be ashamed of themselves for putting this camera on the market. I've owned (and still own) an older, cheaper Kodak that does a much better job of taking good quality pictures indoors than this newer, slightly more expensive camera. I wish I'd had not bought the Z915. When the batteries run down on this Z915 camera, I'll simply sell it on eBay as a used camera, complete with all original boxes, packing and instructions. It's a real disappointment. No more Kodaks for me. I'll buy a more expensive Canon for it's replacement. I've been a hobby photographer for 30 years and this is the worst camera I've ever owned. I'm really disappointed in it's picture quality. And, no, it's not that I just got a bad camera. A friend got a Z915 at the same time as I bought mine. Her camera performance is just as bad as mine. She now wants a Canon, too. We both just laugh when we see each other's picures taken with the Z915. It's as bad as a kid's toy camera. Even outdoors in bright sunlight, never use the zoom feature unless the camera is on a tripod. You can't hold the camera still enough to take a picture that isn't blurry. We've tried many different settings and nothing seems to work well enough to get a great, clear, sharp picture. My recommendation is stay away from the Kodak Z915! Even at bargain basement, sale prices. It just isn't worth it and you won't be happy with the results!", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Piece of Junk!!", "Author": "Monique1", "ReviewID": "RIIE7SLTI3BST", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me preface this review with the information that a few years ago I received a Kodak camera as a Christmas Gift.  It is a Z712 IS.  Very nice camera.  A few weeks after I got it, it stopped turning on.  Or to be more precise, it turned on and then immediately turned off.  While going through the warranty 'service' of Kodak's \"Help Center\", I found I had to pay to ship the camera to Illinios for it to be repaired.  I was not pleased that their obviously faulty camera was now costing me money to have repaired.  I was shocked that there was no 'repair center' closer than Illinios as I live in New Hampshire.  After a very unsatisfying discussion with their customer service department I was basically told it was to bad and if I wanted the camera fixed I would have to ship it.  I did so.  It was returned several weeks later and it came out of the box doing the same thing I sent it in to have repaired the first time.  I called \"Customer Service\" again, this time quite angry and expressed that I wanted a replacement camera sent to me.  I was told that the best they could do for me was to send me by email and pre-paid shipping label and I would need to re-ship it to Illinios for repair, again.  I did so, it came back with a note saying that there was nothing wrong with it and to use the correct batteries.  I was and had been using a battery that was suggested in the user's manual yet this time it worked. (This camera was not bought through Amazon.)Fast forward to Sept. 2010.  My daughter's 16th birthday was coming up and she had shown a lot of interest in photography, even going so far as to join an extracurricular photography club at school.  I spent considerable time reviewing cameras and the Z915 had some wonderful reviews yet I was hesitant to try them again.  I finally decided I would as it seemed to have the best 'layout' for the money.  Camera arrived.  Daughter's birthday arrived.  Camera turns on and then immediately shuts off when she tries to use it.  We charge the rechargable batteries with the recharger that came in the bundle with the camera.  Tried again, camera turned on and off.  Put the batteries in another camera, that camera ran fine on the batteries.  Called Kodak and was told that I would have to pay to ship the camera.  I finally lost my patience and demanded that they replace the camera with a NEW one at their cost.  One camera is a fluke, two-with the exact same problem is shoddy quality control.  Especially when one of the automated options on the menu was to hit #1 if your camera would not turn on.  That tells me its a regular problem.I was put on hold for 15 minutes or so and was informed by the woman 'assisting' me that they would send me a pre-paid shipping label so that I could have the camera repaired, in Illinios still apparently.  I informed them to keep their label, I would return the camera for a refund.  NEVER again will I purchase a Kodak product, not even their prints.The camera may well take wonderful pictures but if it won't turn on it doesn't much matter.  So my daughter is out a present for her 16th birthday and I have to figure out a way to buy her a new one while waiting for the refund to come through. (Amazon's help center only gave me the option of a refund as they no longer stock this particular product.)", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Regular", "Author": "R.
