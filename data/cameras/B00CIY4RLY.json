On top of that, not long after I purchased the products, I received an email from the seller asking if everything was fine. I mentioned about the leaking cleaning fluid, and next thing I knew, I received a new package that contains the bottle. There are 6 items in the package. Yes, none of them was expensive item, but the service was good and quick.Just want to share with you.=== Original Review ===I only used this camera for 2 days. So far it works great, much better than my 7-yr-old Sony camera. :) It is like a mini computer. It adjusts lights so well and I could tell it's \"scanning\" the surrounding from the screen. Very cool. I used it on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning when the natural light was not good enough. This camera adjusted the light on the image so the flash light didn't flash. Awesome pictures.The missing star is not because of the camera itself. Since this order is a package of stuff, I think it's fair to rate the rest too.The cleaning fluid came out and wet everything in the cleaning kit box. I am so glad all 3 things in the kit were also wrapped in a plastic bag. Otherwise everything would be damaged. So now I only have 1/3 of the fliud... :(", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "good quality for price", "Author": "Randy Johnson", "ReviewID": "R280Z9XJXDCJ18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony camera had excellent features for the product. Pic as well as zooming feature were exceptional value. Only drawback on the camera was the WiFi upload does not work with window eight application from Sony only works with android and Apple application. Sony need to update their application to support window phone and window eight applications.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony DSC-WX300/B 18 MP Digital Camera with 20x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black)", "Author": "LesW", "ReviewID": "R1RN2GWC3UYN29", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Shipping and delivery time were great.  Right on time. The camera and attachments were all there and packing was great.  The camera took several great shots the first couple of days.  Then my wife and I wanted to download shots to her computer.  Went online to the suggested Sony website and downloaded the \"Home\" program.  No problems.  Hooked up the camera and downloaded the few pictures we had taken.  Noticed it had not downloaded a short video we had taken, but the other shots were there with very good clarity.  Un-plugged the camera after the download.  Next time we turned on the camera it would either not shoot a photo or shot only one.  Turned it on and off several times, still would shoot only one photo at a time.  Next we tried different modes on the mode dial and noticed the modes on the screen did not correspond with the mode on the dial.  Tried a chat with Sony reps, they said it needed to be re programmed.  Only had the camera a few days, so contacted Amazon for return.  No problems with the return and a full refund of our money.  Amazon was great.  Maybe we just got a bad camera, maybe the online Sony program screws with the camera???? Do not know!! Will not order another Sony though.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Missing Case", "Author": "Ali \"Ali\"", "ReviewID": "R8O3UO5NMM6KN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera itself is a little smaller than imagined but works great. However, I would recommend buying the camera on its own because this kit came without the case.

Bought this to replace a year old Nikon that took a blurry picture seeming every other one. The new Sony hasn't shot a blurry one yet, but I've only had it a month. I have only used the full auto mode and that seems to work great for me.The camera comes with one battery and the bundle provided two more plus a wall charger. So far I have only charged them all initially and, after a few dozen pictures, the first battery still shows a full charge. Also included a Vivitar 50-in-1 card reader, Sony 32 GB SDHC card and a camera case.  Note on the camera case: It fits tight, almost like a glove, and I had to squeeze the two extra batteries into the zippered front compartment. The case has a belt loop and a plastic piece to hook a carrying strap - but does not include the strap.Products arrived well-packed. Arrived in three days from ordering.Yes, I would definitely buy from Focus Camera again.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny.
