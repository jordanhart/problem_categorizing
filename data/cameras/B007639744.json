{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great and undervalued camera", "Author": "Photographer", "ReviewID": "R2P6A7WWS7WWIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Feb 14 2013 update:I have since added 3 fixed focal length lenses - 20, 85, 100 - to be used in my primitive studio in additional to the 14, 28, 35, 50, and 70. I will be using K-01 extensively in studio instead of the K-5. Focus peaking is so easy to use and so useful that I think images from K-01 are sharper than those from K-5. Some claimed that the AA filter is a little weaker in K-01 than K-5, that may also explain but not sure if that is indeed the case.I have taken the K-01 to NYC over Christmas holiday. It worked beautifully. I have little desire to get a K-5II(s) that I was considering late last year. So now my wish is that Pentax will release an updated K-02.Original:Let me first point out that I have been using Pentax equipment for decades, so I am somewhat biased. I am currently using a K-5 but have been interested in K-01 for a while. The recent drop in price pushed me over and I am now a happy owner.It has most of the internals of the K-5 but without the mirror box or viewfinder. Even though I am a long time user of SLR, I believe that the mirror box has well passed its usefulness and should be eliminated. But the K-01 is not perfect yet. It does not have all of the direct control buttons as K-5. The single control dial is not as convenient as the two dials in K-5. I am still getting used to relying on the LCD screen. It is not WR as the K-5. I like the look of the camera but the placement of buttons, especially the on/off and shutter release, could be better, at least for me.The look is just great. I got a lot of \"Like\" when I posted a picture on facebook, even from friends that are \"quiet\" most of the time. The boxy shape not only looks good but is also very functional. It makes holding the camera sturdy very easy, though not as good as the K-5. Focus speed is much faster than I expected for CDAF. I don't know how it stacks up again M43 from Panasonic and Olympus, but the speed is sufficiently fast for me. I was using a Tamron 17-50 f/2.8 (screw drive) and Sigma 18-125 (HSM)to test focus speed. The fact that I can pick anywhere on the screen to focus really makes composing easier than that of K-5. And focus peaking is just a great feature.Now the best part - no mirror box. K-5 is by far the most quiet camera that I have tried, including Nikon (D3s, D800, D300, D7000)and Canon (T1, T2i, D60). K-01 is close behind in noise but vibration is reduced. One of my main concern was vibration, especially since it would be held differently than a SLR. I was able to put that to rest. I had no problem taking sharp pictures at 1/10th second and at focal lengths longer than 100mm. I am sure SR also helped to make that possible.The K-01 will be matched with a Sigma 18-125 as a walk around combination. It is relatively small and the look will not attract unwanted attention.For anyone sitting on the fence about this camera, don't hesitate. At the current price, it is a fantastic deal. It is cheaper than buying an older micro 4/3 camera but IQ is head and shoulder better. I know that because I was actually thinking of getting a E-PM1.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Elegant", "Author": "Timber", "ReviewID": "R215HDSSQX8689", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased 10 of these Pentax K01 cameras in order to solve the problem of dust on the sensor.  By having a lens permanently attached to each camera, I will not be using my time to dust spot pictures and movies.  The criticisms that this camera have received seem to be from people who did not think through their purchasing and needs.  (1)  Comfortable to hold;  It's as comfortable to hold as any older SLR.  They call it \"The Brick\".  BECAUSE it is not thin, I don't have to hold it with my FINGERTIPS.  I can hold this camera in the palm of my hand locked-in with my thumb, a solid grip on it.  (2) The 16mp sensor is Sony's latest, and 16mp is all I will ever need.  (3) High quality 3200 iso speed:  It is written elsewhere that this is a low light champ of cameras.  (4)  Movies:  Aperature changes automatically to adjust sensitivity if the light changes; such as the situation wherein you would be walking from room-to-room.  Great.  (5)  It takes M42 mount and Pentax mount lenses.  This means you can purchase Zeiss or Schneider or Pentax lenses and use them on this camera.  With M42 mount you should then purchase a \"M42 to Pentax K or KA\" adapter WHICH HAS THE FLANGE ON IT (not the cheaper one without the flange) so that automatic aperature will operate for M42 lenses.  M42 lenses are oldie but goodies which you can purchase for very little. To learn more about them go to \"PentaxForums\"  (6)  Since there is no mirror in the camera, there is no mirror bounce to blur slightly your pictures when handheld.  And it is quieter to use.  (7)  Unless you really need the speed, choose Pentax or M42 lenses which are slower, such as F3.5 or F4 (prime lenses) because these lenses are usually sharper than faster lenses.  But that is your choice.  Since there is no optical viewfinder, a faster lens won't give you a brighter personal view with this camera.  I'll give you an example of a lens choice:  Zeiss Flektogon 20mm F4 M42;  Jupiter 9 85mm F2 (Russian) M42;  Schneider Curtagon 35mm M42; Pentax K A 50mm F1.7; Sigma 50mm F2.8 Macro in Pentax K A mount;  Curtagon 28mm in M42 mount, etc. So, this list will get you going. (8)  The white color of the camera is elegant in styling, not cheap looking.  It may look cheap in the photo, but it's elegant in person.  The first thing you notice about it is that it is sophisticated looking.  It just says:  \"Art piece\".  (9)  The SD card is solidly protected with 2 covers.  The outside rubber cover is deliberately connected to the camera with a large rubber ring in order to give it \"play\" so that it will not wear out.  It fits snugly to the camera to prevent dust from getting in.  And the palm of your hand also serves to keep the rubber door closed.  (10)  While the camera may not be considered \"sealed\", all joints are tight.  (11)  For triggering studio lights, use the hot shoe.  (12)  Focus Peaking helps to focus manual lenses by highlighting the area that is in focus.  The highlight area is white in color.  This is OK, but it would be nice to select the color of the highlight.  (13)  I chose cameras in Yellow, White, and Black.  I use black cameras for my wide angle lenses 15-24mm; I use White cameras for 28-60mm (for body shots of models); and Yellow cameras for 70mm and higher.  (14)  The camera can accept outboard electronic viewfinders.  But I am not using these cameras for sporting shots.  Usually the camera is used on a tripod photographing a person.  (15)  Since I have a dedicated lens for each camera, I can process each entire SD card with DXOmark for lens corrections.  I won't have to remember which lens I used and when.  (16)  The Yellow color camera makes me smile when I look at it.  And it makes other people smile when they look at it.  Perfect.  (17)  With each lens, I have a permanent lens hood which is taped with black drafting tape, strengthened by an inner layer of strapping tape.  I then leave a rectangular hole in the front.  This is my \"professional shade\" that is custom fitted to the particular prime lens.  You cannot do this with variable focal length lenses!  And so I can get the last ounce of contrast in any situation with this handmade and fitted shade. (18)  In regards to light obscuring the view of the LCD;  well, the LCD is bright enough.  But if I want to, I can simply use a camera rain cover in black cloth to provide weather protection or sunlight shading over the LCD.  Then I put the camera back into its zip lock bag to protect it from weather, smoky air, and dusty wind.  (19)  Menus are well organized  (20)  extra buttons on top, red and green,  can be programmed to assist you when you use manual, older lenses.  (21)  To start a movie, you just press the red button anytime, no need to go through menus.  And the red button is a comfortable distance to hit.  The green one, used to check manual lens exposure is further away, which is OK, not a problem.  (22)  Since the sensor is smaller than full frame, any movies you take have lots of sharpness and depth of field, so, in this way it is more forgiving than the full frame cameras by Nikon and Canon.  Better to have sharpness than be alittle off.  I purchased my cameras when it was announced that this camera was being discontinued.  I immediately saw the possibility of having a dedicated camera to each lens I owned, so I acted fast.  If you need a speedy camera to photograph birds in flight or basketball players, this is not the camera for you.  (23)  It records in Adobe DNG Raw format.  I recommend it for Tourist shots and all tripod mounted professional photography in the studio or on location professional photography.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "K-01 is a good instrument", "Author": "Maxim", "ReviewID": "R2WWJU36XT1RQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Auto-focus is good enough, sometimes it works definitely better than K-5 in a live-view mode.Manual focusing with sharp edges is a really cool feature: it greatly helps to focus without digital zoom, all sharp areas across the frame becomes easily visible.Very good overall image quality(as usual it depends from the lens).Noise level seems to be the same as k-5. At least after the RAW processing in Photoshop I'm getting the same results.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Now with the lower price - you can't go wrong", "Author": "Faxanadu", "ReviewID": "R1SNSYHIIEU6V2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera. It is NOT compact for a mirrorless (micro 4/3 does this better) and it is not the fastest on the planet - so why the recommendation? Image quality.This camera takes great pictures and really good video as well. It is basically a modified Pentax K5 without the mirror and optical viewfinder. It has focus peaking (though Sony does this a bit better) and much better video options than the K5.The design is bulky - and some items, like the green button, are difficult to operate. However, the camera is built like a tank and unique looking. I have the white - but the yellow seems to get the most attention.If you have Pentax lenses - this is a no-brainer - you can use a great set of legacy lenses right away.When the K-01 first came out - it was much too expensive. At the lower prices at the end of 2012 - this is a bargain - great back-up camera if you have a Pentax K DLSR and fantastic image quality - you really can't go wrong on this one.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great camera for the price!!", "Author": "marty", "ReviewID": "R2QA4ZGMQJI3WA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Pentax Mirrorless is larger than other mirrorless cameras but the price is right. The larger size allows one to use the large selection of pentax lenses.  The pictures are excellent. The only complaint is the autofocus is slow.

It is had to categorize as it is large for a mirrorless camera; the size was necessary to accommodate existing and past Pentax lenses without a cumbersome adapter. Reviewers were unaccustomed to it's design and tried to judge it by their more familiar DSLR standards, and so viewed it unfavorably. It was also ahead of its time with body colors, which are now increasingly popular, but led some not to take it seriously.  There were a few issues at first which have been rectified by firmware updates.This unique camera is built like a tank, has focus peaking, exceptional picture quality, and provides something \"different\" for photographers to use.  As prices have come down it has become a better and better value.  Remaindered cameras and kits are still available on line at greatly discounted prices, although some sellers are still holding the line on prices, banking on demand as it becomes popular as a cult camera and gets increasingly scarce at better prices.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Steal This Camera!", "Author": "John Ramsay", "ReviewID": "R6VPI0MZL5GHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The K-01 was a longshot for Pentax and at it's original selling price it bombed. It has the same sensor and many of the same features of the K5 DSLR so at under $300 it is a steal. It works with all my pentax lenses and the image quality is outstanding. The LCD viewfinder does wash out in the outdoor sun but for less than $30.00 I bought an LCD viewfinder and I am good to go!", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "some good, some bad", "Author": "oldsalt19", "ReviewID": "R2I15DMR2RUGOH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product is in the process of being discontinued by Pentax after one short year.  It really flopped.  Be sure that you have firmware v1.03 installed.  You can get this from the Pentax website.  The earlier firmware versions had some focusing problems but these problems mostly disappeared when I installed v1.03 firmware.  The other big problem was the lack of a viewfinder.  The camera depends on the LCD screen which is close to unworkable in sunlight.  My solution was an auxiliary viewfinder designed for rangefinder cameras with a standard accessory shoe.  I got a turret design with capability for different focal lengths.  Another solution that I have used with some success is the Hoodman LCD viewer.  Other than that, the camera works well and is a real steal at its distressed price of about $400.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Substitute For the SLR you cannot afford.", "Author": "Charles G.

Given that, I wanted a modern platform with features, accuracy, and some amount of compactness to fit my lenses. A tall order but the K01 fits the bill. This is a great camera that is easy to use. The ratings say \"quirky\", but I say compact, easier to transport, and fully featured. Special factors include a highlight manual focusing mode that is easy on the eyes and very accurate for detailed work. Having to wear reading glasses anyway, who needs a view finder? You can go from taking pictures to reviewing results with your \"cheaters\" on!

More compact than a DSLR.  Live view opens up new shooting opportunities and perspective.  pancake lens makes the camera less obtrusive and allows for easier street and event photography.  The in-camera color settings are amazing and reduce a lot of post-processing work for RAW images.  The new focusing feature makes using manual lenses a breezeNegatives:My number on complaint of this camera is its inability to achieve focus in low light/low contrast situations.  Also, the camera refocuses after every shot, even if you are shooting the same subject.  Thus, you are forced to obtain auto-focus and then select manual focus if you want to do several shots at the same focal point in quick succession.  Shutter lag is a real limitation.  Also, the camera does not support a wireless remote shutter.  This is inexcusable.  Finally, the liveview is difficult to use in bright situations and IMPOSSIBLE to use if you are wearing polarized sunglasses.Other comments:  Much has been said about the grip and button placement.  You cannot grip this camera like a DSLR or point and shoot.  It must be griped as a video game controller with you thumb on the shutter release.  This is neither positive or negative, just different.  Also, the \"rubber door\" that people complain about is not an issue if you close it properly (i.e. \"slide\" it into place...it doesn't \"pop into place.\"Overall impressions:  This is a fun little camera.  At $315, it was a steal and has become my \"go-along\" camera anytime I go out but am not specifically \"going shooting.\"  I like its low-profile, in camera effects, IQ and the outline focus feature.  I look at it as a big point and shoot that delivers the IQ and creative flexibility of a DSLR.  This is NOT a replacement for a DSLR, but it is a nice supplement to it.As I said, the jury is still out.  But I really like being able to grab-and-go with this camera in situations where I would otherwise be hesitant to lug my DSLR.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Fred1872", "ReviewID": "R2249YBF2EDUHS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great advantage in owning this camera is that I can use the lenses that I used with my film based K1000 body.  The only negative in this is that the older lenses do not communicate with the body as do the newer lenses, but a dial on the body will allow the user to dial the extreme positions of a telephoto lens accurately and the more astute user should be able to interpolate some intermediate positions with a degree of accuracy.  Another plus is the battery life.  The battery is removed for charging and has a very long lifespan, so one need not worry about having spare batteries for an all day shoot.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "16 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor with low noise image capture at ISO range 100-25600\nGorgeous contemporary styling by world renowned designer Marc Newson\nMirrorless body design with Pentax K mount lens compatibility that allows any Pentax K mount lens to work.\nFull HD 1080p video capture @ 30FPS with h.264 compression ( 60FPS at 720p)\nFast 6 FPS burst mode ideal for fast action photography", "Name": "Pentax Mirrorless Body Design Compatible with Pentax K Mount Lenses K-01 Body Kit (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ewwGnXPEL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007639744"}}
