{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Low profile color for a superb street lens.", "Author": "Joe Rama \"360\"", "ReviewID": "RVHRZWMHD1J6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some people are offended by the pricing of the black version of this lens, and it is relatively expensive compared to the optically identical, original, standard silver version (at about a $200 premium, since the hood + filter come in at about $100 total).  But the lens is superb, and in at least some of the reviews for the standard (silver) lens, the main complaint is the lack of black (and silver mismatches from lenses to silver bodies).  For me, silver shouts especially on a black body (contrast silver/black), and black blends in and is suitably low profile for street and casual photography.As for the $200 premium, I do not think it is quite as extreme as it seemed before the lenses were released, since they seem to have been produced in the low thousands (rumors suggest 3,000 worldwide) --- so it is VERY limited release, and presumably much more expensive to manufacture than usual mass production.The first 2-star review probably didn't know the economics of the manufacturing since the \"review\" was posted before the lens was even shipped.Personally, I wish that Olympus would release all their lenses in both silver and black.  In any case, I am glad the 12mm (24mm equivalent) was released in black because it's small, fast (aperture), and a great walk-around lens.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is a very nice lens (and a good investment too)", "Author": "B. I. Sevilla \"El Chubasco\"", "ReviewID": "R2YHHV08TJITCN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This lens is just beautiful and it looks very handsome in my black EM-5. I do not think that is necessary to write a review about the optics and image quality of this lens because there are plenty of reviews out there written by experts. The matter here is: Is this black lens worth $300 more than the silver lens? Well, that depends on how you value camera equipment. Look around and check the market, you will notice that lenses are expensive (and many times ugly) and they keep their value for a long time. I recently sold an almost 20-years-old Nikon AF 85 1.8 (non-D) for 3/4 the amount of money you would pay for a new one (D version). Yes! a used lens that I bought used and was used by who knows how many people before I did. The lens was in excellent shape though.My point is that lenses are very good investment for your money. If keep in good condition they do not depreciate substantially. This black Olympus is (and will be) a classic.  If Olympus does not do what Fuji did with their customers who bought the black X100, the happy owners of this limited-edition lens will feel that in fact, they did a good investment. In addition, this happy customers will be delighted with the joy of shooting with this optically-excellent lens. Micro 4/3 is going to stay. Many pros are switching to this format because it just makes a lot of sense. Lighter and smaller with dslr quality is a no-brainier. The optics of the big and heavy dslrs are from 30 years ago. Digital is different than film as smartphones are different from old land-line telephones.Finally, the lens comes with hood, filter, plastic and metal caps (the plastic cap is for when hood is on), which are worth at least an extra $150. At the end, for an extra $150 you get a very high quality product, beautifully packed in black boxes wrapped on white rice paper, and the certainty that you are one among 3000 human beings in this planet who have the privilege to own this jewel.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Olympus Special 12mm", "Author": "Nancy Zogleman", "ReviewID": "R12Y3IY9768560", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an absolutely wonderful lens!

This black varient will very likely show wear as all true metal painted/coated lenses do, so I'm happy to use my silver version. If this thing was molded plastic then I guess the black would be fine.  Just like the Panasonic Leitz lenses. But the premium for the limited run of a mere black variant lens?
