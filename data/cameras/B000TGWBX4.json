{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera, Very User Friendly", "Author": "T. Williford", "ReviewID": "R2LQHUZANCRS8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my father for Christmas. He had previously used a Fuji fine pix that had to have the alkaline batteries replaced very frequently. It was very important to me that the rechargeable batteries last a long time. I have a Samsung digital camera as well and knew that the rechargeable battery held it's charge a long time. This camera does not disappoint. It takes great pictures and is very user friendly. I wanted to make sure the buttons were easily distinguishable and simple for him to decipher. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others because of it's great picture quality, long life rechargeable battery and ease of use.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent low-priced point and shoot", "Author": "J. MCNUTT", "ReviewID": "R1EMABGZG4UE6H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Takes great pictures with proper lighting, flash is quite a bit more filling than expected for a small camera.Pictures with the flash (and relatively close subjects) seem to come out very good, with great balance of lighting, color, and sharp focus.There is a lot of noise when there is insufficient light, and (at least on the camera I got), there seemed to be strange banding in the low-light noising areas.By default it seems the flash wants to be in Red-Eye fix mode, in which it post-processes the image after taking the picture to remove red-eye.  Nice feature, but I prefer it to be disabled as it can take a long time to process the images and it means it's not ready to take pictures for a while.  It's disabled with the click of a button, but changing modes and/or powering the camera off returns this \"default\" setting.  There is a traditional two-flash red-eye mode, but I prefer any post processing to be handled by my photo software and not so much by the camera.ISO higher than 800, too noisy, however, there are quite a bit of manual settings on it that can allow you to minimize some of the auto settings.Low-light focusing has issues as there's no infrared sensor, so at times it's best to focus several times before taking the picture to find the right focal length.", "Date": "January 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Neil Nodado", "ReviewID": "R3D6HMDUP6LQ5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for the best under $200 this is it!

Image quality does suffer a bit from the price and I don't like the proprietary cord connections. The charger is proprietary and the data cable to download the pictures is.
