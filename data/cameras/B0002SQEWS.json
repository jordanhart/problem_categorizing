I wanted something small that could be used as a point-and-shoot and fit easily in my pocket. Unlike last time, I put a lot of time into researching before I bought this time. My priorities were convenience and resolution, as well as as little lag time as possible and as much manual control as I can get for a compact non-SLR model. Oh yeah, and under $500. Am I asking too much? Apparantly not for the geniuses at Sony that came up with the p150!It is about the size of my Motorola cellphone (slightly thicker), and both fit comfortably in my front pocket next to each other.To be honest, I haven't had it long enough to testify to the picture quality, but the reason I am writing this review was because my one reservation in buying this camera turned out to be unfounded, and more people may want to know this: This camera is FAST. Had I read this in a review beforehand, my decision would have been much easier. I was really worried about the lag time when taking pictures. This was a frustration with my older model of Cybershot and all the reviews I read point to the Canon Elph line for the place to go if you want speed, but for the same resolution I was looking at paying twice as much for a Canon.I'm sure those reviewers were telling the truth, but I think the difference in speed is a little overstated. I'm very pleased with the improvement from my older model.I decided the p150 had the most bang for my buck and bought it, anxious to see what kind of lag time there was. This camera turns on in a flash. The startup sound starts as soon as you press the power button, and by the time it finishes, you're ready to start snapping pics. If you push the button straight down to snap a pic, it does take a brief moment, but if you hold it halfway for the camera to focus first, then when you're ready to take the picture and press it the rest of the way, there is no delay that I have noticed so far. That means no more of this: \"Okay, everybody smile! 1... 2... 3!.... Hang on! It'll take it in a minute!

Let me explain. My purchase goal was to find an idiot-proof, ultra-compact, high resolution point and shoot camera. Maybe I have high expectations, but I wanted a no-fiddling camera for what I consider \"easy shots\" and I didn't want to have to settle for 4 mega-pixels. Basically, that's it. I didn't care about video mode or manual settings or any advanced feature. If necessary, I was prepared to give in and settle for the new Canon SD300 (4mp) which my friend had bought. That's why I was hoping desperately that the P150 would work out. And it almost did.The fatal flaw was motion blur on over half of what I consider easy shots. It doesn't matter how many pixels you have or how vivid the colors, if you get blurry pictures more than half the time, the camera is not usable. Blur cannot be corrected.So, what's an easy shot?Example easy shot #1: indoor, reasonable light, flash enabled, standard automatic mode, very low motion. The Sony auto-focus stubbornly insisted on using 1/40th shutter speed. If the subject moves at all, you get blur. The cause of the blur may partly be due to a design that places the lens on the far left of the camera body which amplifies camera movement. I tried both single and monitoring auto-focus modes to no avail.Example easy shot #2: outdoor, sunlight, flash enabled, standard automatic mode, moderate motion (somebody walking at a distance). More motion blur! Yes, there was a workaround if you resort to using the special \"sports\" scene mode which uses a much higher shutter (with great results) or manual settings. But that shouldn't be required for a point and shoot camera for such an easy shot.What made the blur so irritating was that it was not predictable. In some cases, a slower shutter would be used and in other almost identical shots a faster shutter would be used. In addition, you can't see the blur on the LCD, so you don't know when to retake the picture.My reasoning on the two stars is that the camera was not usable for me. I returned it. I almost kept it and thought about teaching my wife to use the special modes in certain conditions, but realized that was a losing battle and returned it for the Canon SD300.I compared the Sony and Canon for the better part of four days using at least a hundred shots of both. I even kept retesting the blur scenes in disbelief. The two cameras produced very similar results - each with their own flaws. The Canon's flaw was poor flash performance when up close - the Sony backs off when up close. Obviously, the Sony produces higher resolution pictures, but to check if 4 was sufficient, I had 20 prints of each made (three of them 8 x 10) at Kinko's on a high end dye-sub printer and the 4mp vs 7mp difference was not noticeable by the four people I surveyed. Both sets of pictures were amazing. So, I felt comfortable settling for 4mp.Despite the fatal blur flaw, the Sony had the following pros:* super fast operation* nice dial switch to make auto-mode obvious* easily pocketable (but not with tight jeans)* dazzling color and detail* nice flash performance considering the sizeSome additional cons that I was willing to ignore:* unusable video recording feature due to the blurring by the camera's slow lens refocus and MPEG artifacts. The video on the Canon SD300 was stunningly clear (close to mini DV).* awkward ergonomic design with lens on far left - it bumps into your fingers when powering on and it takes you about two days to get used to this. From then on, you are conditioned to be paranoid about powering on your camera.* zoom switch in wrong place makes holding and zooming even more awkwardIts really unfortunate that a camera with such potential has such a fatal flaw. And if you're wondering maybe I didn't read the manual or don't know how to hold a camera or drink too much coffee, believe me I tried everything. If your comfortable using manual shutter settings or using special sports mode for indoor low-motion shots, then get this camera.", "Date": "November 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "Best point-and-shoot on the market?", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1TDH38CHEYQ0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an avid photographer who was looking for a truly pocketable digital to compliment my larger, more full-featured Olympus digital. I also wanted something fast, both in terms of start-up and shot-to-shot cycle time and was unwilling to compromise on image quality.  Lower down on my criteria list was a camera that had strong video capability -- high-res w/o recording time limits that many cameras (including many of the Canon digital Elphs that I was strongly considering).  If your primary critera are size, speed, and image quality, you can't go wrong with this camera.  Prior to purchase, I was quite worried, to be honest, about some reviews mentioning blurry photos.  After 2 month's of use, however, I can only assume that those mentioning such problems either received faulty units or, more likely, don't know how to use this (or other) camera properly or are taking shots under conditions (low light and/or fast moving subject) where blur is normal.  MY IMAGES HAVE BEEN SURPRISINGLY CRISP, WELL-FOCUSED, AND VIBRANT, even using the flash, and my most frequent subjects are my 3- and 1-year-old daughters (not the easiest subjects to shoot!).  As for resolution, I was not looking for a 7-megapixel camera, but I must say, it comes in handy.  People talked about the potential to crop down significantly to essentially increase the zoom capability.  I was leary of this as I was doubtful that the focus on such detail would allow me to do this while retaining a sharply-focused subject, but I've been very surprised by the focus detail and am now quite glad I have all that the extra resolution to work with.Is this the perfect digital camera?  I don't think any camera is perfect.  I'd love to have manual white balance  (though I've yet to have a photo that has not had the auto setting do a wonderful job on) and other manual controls, RAW support, a more powerful flash, better burst shooting, and other high-end features.  But for cameras in this class, this camera is hard to beat.  If you can go with something just a little larger (but still quite small), take a look at the fairly new Olympus C-7000.  For those considering the P200, read the reviews carefully as I've seen some reports that noise is more of a problem, though in general it seems like a worthwhile upgrade, especially if you can get it at a lower price.  Amazon's current price on the P150 is sure easy to beat from reputable sources now with just a few quick searches.  If you are looking for a backup battery (I've never needed mine - it lasts forever), check out batteries-dot-com for a much cheaper alternative.  As for flash, Vivitar's DF120 far exceeds Sony's branded model for half the cost.  I tried to buy the Vivitar DF200 as a more worthy slave flash but Amazon's stock was depleted and not resupplied.  If flash is important to you for this or other digital camera, there are some very capable, pwerful SLAVE flashes available (can use with most/any digital camera type, no need to mount, easy to use, add much versatility to your camera).", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "The Sony's P150 is a solid mean machine!", "Author": "Roy Chan", "ReviewID": "R1K7CL9QCLSALK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Size, Above average to excellent photos, 7MP camera, KISS camera, big pictures, fast everything speed, movies with sound.

It has 7.2 megapixels, so my pictures have stunning detail. The color is also excellent; even on an automatic setting. The movie mode has is excellent; with 2X the frames/seconds & 2X the resolution (I regularly record my golf swing, so this is an important feature). It's only time limitation is amount of memory (many cameras have 30 second limits). I also regularly use the mult-burst mode to take 16 pictures in ~2 seconds (also for my golf swing). In bright light, I can increase the shutter speed to 1/1,000 second to capture more high-speed detail. The Battery life is much better than my old camera (I get ~3 hours/charge). I carry my DSC-150 everywhere, so I'm capturing pictures I would have otherwise missed.

I ended up with a P-150 anyways for a couple of reasons:  1) Sony has not announced an underwater housing for the P200 and 2) The larger LCD may result in  poorer battery performance.I've had the P-150 for a few weeks now and have taken a few hundred pictures.  It replaced a Fuji Finepix 4900 because I found myself wanting a more compact camera.  The Fuji took great pictures, but I didn't take it with me very often because of it's bulk, and the Sony offered the same manual modes that I found myself using on the Fuji.I'm very happy with the camera, though it did take some getting used to to operate optimally for low light shots.The pros:1) Extremely small size but well designed and easy to hold2) Extremely fast camera; startup and shutter lag are much improved over many other cameras.  Not as good as a film (or even digital) SLR, but  definitely better then most digicams.  Action / motion shots are much easier to accomplish.3) Great battery life4) All the essential controls are available (9 scene modes, program auto exposure, manual, automatic, etc); great movie mode (640x480 at 30fps)5) Focus assist lamp to help low light shots6) Excellent optics & macro modeCons:1) No manual whitebalance (look to the P-200)2) Questionable decisions for low light automatic pictures (see below).3) Proprietary memory stick media (not a concern if you already have memory sticks or don't have an existing investment in another format)To specifically address some other users concerns about blurry pictures.  I believe this is primarily due to a couple poor decisions on Sony's part, but there are simple workarounds.  First, the shutter speed will go as low as 1/40 for indoor shots with flash.  This is simply too slow for most people (myself included) to hold such a tiny camera steady.  Works fine with a tripod and if you take care to brace yourself and the camera, but not a good choice for candid indoor snapshots.  The second probable cause of the blurriness is the multipoint autofocusing.  This is well described in the manual and easy to change to center autofocus in anything but full automatic mode, but it can result in weird focal points.  The workaround I use is to shoot most of the time in \"P\" mode rather then the green automatic mode, leaving everything set to auto but changing focus mode to center.  For low light shots, I often change to \"manual\" mode and simply select a more appropriate shutter speed (1/60 or 1/80 and appropriate aperature).", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Largely obsolete - try the DSC-P200.", "Author": "Snap, Crackle and Pop", "ReviewID": "R1SDA4EK970HYS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera got a glowing review at dpreview.com.

Chilcott", "ReviewID": "R2R65KOTUYSSQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I would like to say that when I was shopping around for a digital camera I looked at as many reviews as possible and I found this site had the most extensive and convincing review on the internet:[...]I got this camera a week ago and I have been using it constantly since.  The DSC-P150 is fantastic in all of the major areas.The Lithium Ion battery charges quickly and power consumption on this camera is very efficient.  The rechargeable battery is a definite plus.  Sure Lithium Ion batteries deteriate after time but considering the fact that there are many cameras that eat batteries in less than a day this is a great deal.Since this is a point & shoot camera it is obviously nowhere near the quality of a digital SLR but this camera still takes great pictures.  The 7-mega pixel images are amazingly clear and take up just over 2 Megs of space.  The shutter speed is enough to provide clear images in even low light conditions.The memory stick provided is only 32 Megs and I highly suggest buying a stick with at least 512 megs if you plan on shooting images mainly on 5 - 7 mega pixels.  SanDisk makes great cards at a fraction of the price.The transfer speed with USB 2.0 is great as well and it doesn't drain the battery power much like in most digital cameras.I was very pleased and surprised with the MPG movie quality.  I created a short film using the highest resolution (640x480 fine) and I played it using the camera and provided RCA/USB cable.The cameras interface is very easy as well.  There are shortcuts that allow you to quickly change image quality on the fly and delete bad images in a second.  These are the two most used features for me and it is incredibly easy.The size of this camera is a definite selling point.  It is so sexy and sleek it is bound to turn heads but don't let its size fool you.  It can still take great images like the big dogs.The only downfalls in this camera that I can see would be the lack of manual control that you can have on an image but if you are looking for that go and buy a digital SLR.

After eight months, we have taken about two thousand pictures with the camera.The good points about the camera are its small size and its speed.  You can turn it on and start taking pictures almost instantaneously, which is a real advantage for catching unexpected moments.There is only one bad point, but it is a real kicker.  About half of the pictures I take come out blurry.  I always take multiple shots as a safeguard, but it is a bit of a pain to filter out all the blurry photos, and sometimes none of the pictures are sufficiently clear.You might just assume I am a bad photographer, but I have owned several other digital cameras as well as a number of film cameras, and I don't have this problem with any of them.One reason the pictures are often blurry is that the camera, by default, will set the shutter speed to 1/40 for flash pictures.  As any photographer can tell you, this is really too slow for most people.  The slow shutter speed, the fact that you have to hold the camera away from your body to see the LCD, and the light weight of the camera combine to make camera shake a real problem.  Even if you manage to hold the camera still, the subjects in the photo may be moving, in which case they will be blurry anyway.Most cameras, including my other digital ones, default to 1/60 for flash pictures, which works much better.  While it is possible to work around this problem by setting the camera to manual mode, I find that to be rather a pain, since you have to set both the shutter and the aperture.  This camera has no shutter priority (Tv) mode, so manual mode is the best option.The second reason that the pictures come out blurry is the auto-focus.  The default mode - multi-AF - is poorly documented and doesn't seem to work that well.  In some cases, green boxes will appear - presumably the locations that were used for focus.  In other cases (usually when the scene is darker), no boxes appear, even though the camera seems to focus correctly using its built in focus assist light and it makes the double beep sound that indicates successful auto-focus.  In those cases, you can only guess what the camera is focusing on.  Even setting the camera on center focus does not solve the problem for me, and there is the added annoyance of having to focus and then re-frame each shot.  I think that the auto-focus in this camera is just not as good as in other cameras.A couple of minor annoyances highlight why Sony is at the back of the pack when it comes to user interfaces.  1) The self-timer setting resets after each photo is taken.  This means that if you want to take a bunch of pictures using the self-timer, you have to remember to press the button before each shot.  I've never seen any other camera that did this.  2) The mode wheel is right on the edge of the camera.  Sometimes, when I pull the camera out of my pocket, the wheel changes settings, and I only discover that I've gone to manual mode (or whatever) after I've taken a shot or two.", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best camera for a mom", "Author": "Kate", "ReviewID": "R2JX89FP8G9L4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a month and I love it.

The 7MP resolution yields breathtaking clarity and resolution even when enlargements are made of the images. The motion picture mode is not as good as a true digital camcorder, but is definitely better than that found on most digital still cameras (and is not limited to any arbitrary length like on many competing cameras.)The optical zoom is easy to use, and operates flawlessly. The battery holds its charge for a very long time, and is easily recharged. Images are very easy to transfer to a PC (much easier than with my old Olympus), as are video images.This model is being phased out, so if you get the opportunity, buy this camera while you can and get a bargain price as a bonus. One spotlight reviewer said he had issues with blurry images. I want to join the overwhelming majority of users here and say categorically that I have never had a problem with blurry images regardless of shooting conditions.There are better digital cameras out there, but not at this combination of tiny size and reasonable price.

Indoor picture quality is better with less blur and the speed to turn on/off and even click to capture picture is a nice improvement.  However there is one MAJOR flaw for me in that Sony have decided for some reason to leave off the trim facility.  Once you have taken a shot, you can zoom in but unlike previous models you can no longer capture the zoomed image as a new shot which means alot more editing on the PC as opposed to the camera itself.

The same memory error popped up again for a few shots during my vacation.  This time it took more than a few re-inserts of the MS for the error to go away.  Got home and the error appeared again right before I was going to download the pics.  This time, I was unable to get rid of the error.  Fortunately, I had a cardreader and I was able to see the pics.  I come to find out that this is a common problem for the Memory Stick.  Maybe it's the MS, maybe it's Sony.  Regardless, this affects the MS technology.  Just do a search online for c:13:01 and you'll see what I mean.  If you want a reliable camera, do not get a Sony.  Otherwise, you're playing russian roulette with your memories.Other complaints, I also own a Canon S500.  Although it's a 5 MP, the Canon is head and shoulders above the P150.

But what I notice with both of my Sony cameras is that they do tend to blur far more frequently than the Canon. I get better video results with the Canon as well. For very smalll cameras the two Sonys are terrific. The Sony serves me well enough for a vest pocket camera on my daily hike. My in the glovebox camera is the Canon G5. And for my professional photography I use 2 of the Canon 10D. In my side-by-side testing I found that I got more blurred shots with P150 than I did with the P100. I don't know why. I had both the Sonys and the Canon G5 set on P, no flash, 400, indoor lighting.  So for a vest pocket camera I would save a few bucks and get a used P100. The 150 just isn't worth the extra $$$ If you aren't going to carry a camera in your pocket I would get the Canon G5. If you want even better pictures then get a Canon Rebel digital. If you want the top of the line get a Canon 10D or the new 20D.
