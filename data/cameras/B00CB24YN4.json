{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Digital Camera/Video Recorder for the $$$", "Author": "Rockinroller \"Rockinroller\"", "ReviewID": "R3GXBFY69TDPF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW!  Was skeptical at first--a 16MP digital camera and video maker for under $50 PLUS a memory card!  Took a chance and ordered this without much investigation or review--just knowing the reputation of Fujifilm in the digital camera industry and, boy, I was not disappointed!  This camera does it all, and does it in a compact unit that's easily stored in my shirt or pants pocket.  I take pictures for a living as part of a real estate valuation and selling business and need to carry a camera in my vehicle's glove box for last-minute, unplanned assignments.  My objective was to find a small camera, but one with quality abilities and not requiring manual settings in order to point-and-shoot.  This one fills the bill--and then some.  The rechargeable battery is a Heaven-sent, and the stored power seems to last for weeks and weeks before recharging is required.  Plus it charges easily via USB connection--in both my car and my laptop.I'd say the only negative issue is the size of the power-on button.  You almost have to zero in on it with the corner of your finger nail to activate it--it's so small.  But I excuse that in favor of the overall diminished size of this unit and the ease for which it is stored.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problems after 1 use", "Author": "O's Nanna", "ReviewID": "R1THNTSOGVBV4R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera a month ago. I used it once and am already experiencing a problem. I used this camera over the weekend and last night sat down to review the pix. I was in the process of deleting some and zooming in on others to get a closer look at them. At one point on zooming in it froze. I tried shutting it off, but that didn't work, so I pulled the battery. It reset itself after that action. I then replaced the battery and went back to viewing again, and again it froze when I zoomed in on a picture. I called Fuji this morning and the guy on the other end told me that the store may or may not exchange it. That was up to store policy. If they won't do anything then I need to send it back to Fuji at MY EXPENSE! It's only a month old...what kind of customer service it that? I'm going to Best Buy today to see if I can get a refund. I don't want anything to do with Fuji after this. I had a Kodak before and it lasted about 6 YEARS!", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little point and shoot", "Author": "Dana M. Lyons \"medieval monk\"", "ReviewID": "RRVSFSS9YXI7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know why there is so much negativity about this camera. I for one love this camera. I bought it to bring with me ever where. It's compact and easy to use. It has lots of features that are on my Fujifilm Finepix S1800 - I know it does not zoom far, but for what it is and what most people will use it for, it's great. I think the people with the negative reviews were looking for a camera that does it all at a very low price, you something for nothing or almost nothing. Gee people embrace this camera, it's good at what it does. If you want more features, buy a bridge camera or a lower end dslr. Some people are never happy. I am!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "If I could give it 0 stars I would", "Author": "Jace", "ReviewID": "R32ZJ5ING1JS4G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There must be a bad batch, but I bought one, and it would only turn on when plugged into the wall. As soon as it was unplugged it turned off. Returned and exchanged it for another one, and same problem.
