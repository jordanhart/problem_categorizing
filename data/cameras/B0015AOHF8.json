Thus, despite the clean smell, I needed to buy a new one.The remotes and its expected associated functions work great!  As one would expect, the functionality matched in every way my previous remote.  I definitely recommend buying this remote.Plus, the price was substantially higher at the shop.On a final note, the instructions for programming the remotes are sparse and vague.  I brought it to my favorite audio car place (they do remote start as well) and had them program it for me.  Fortunately, I was able to get this service for free.  If you are spending more than 10-15 minutes attempting to program, then cave in and get help.  Otherwise you will end up like me, wasting a plethora of time for something that truly takes 3 minutes if you know how.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "remotes", "Author": "Joanne Womack", "ReviewID": "R1X51Z2TC79SQ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "they look to be the same as i've got the originial just blk be i'm having a hard time getting someone to program them", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Saved $$!", "Author": "Andrew C.

I ordered this so my wife can have a remote to access our car as well. I already have an avital and needed a second one. This came with instructions included in original box. You can also get them online. They pretty easy to follow. When they tell you to press the button on the remote to complete pairing, you just have to press ANY button on your remote. It doesn't matter which one. I set it up within 5 minutes. Super easy and worth every penny.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works like a champ", "Author": "Scott St Onge", "ReviewID": "RPQWNGRWRIJKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little thing works like a champ.

That was the good part.The manufacturer's pairing instructions, however, left a bit to be desired... like which button on the remote was to be pressed in order to complete the pairing sequence.Add to that insult, the manufacturer did not provide an easily found U.S. email address or phone number for technical help.Finally had to email their Canadian subsidiary who was more than helpful.Guess that once in while you do have to go \"off shore\" to get something done right.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "weak", "Author": "steve", "ReviewID": "R397LD40V563PL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the item never came with instructions - when i emailed the company for instructions, they never wrote back.
