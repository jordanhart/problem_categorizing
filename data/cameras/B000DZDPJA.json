By far, for the money and features, this camera IS AWESOME!! 8.2 MGP and the HUGE screen is absolutely amazing and it takes WONDERFUL pictures. The ONLY downfall is that it charges only on a DOCK, (not just a cord) but the dock is small and VERY light, so it travels easily. That's it- everything else about it very cool. Onscreen finishing, effects, tinting, etc. I didn't need any sorts of bells or whistles as i have little camera experience, and with this its just point and shoot- and the extras aren't daunting in difficulty.all in all, its a sweet camera at a sweet price!", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "It does what I want it to do and more!", "Author": "N.

You can take pictures in color, b&w;, and in antique brown tone, enhance the color, sharpen, thin the fat, make artistic touches, stitch together landscapes to make murials.  Landscapes are wonderful. Up-close photos are not washed out. As for using only one hand, I always use two hands, so that is unimportant to me anyway. You must adjust the view screen to see outdoors on a bright day, but then it is easy to see.  HP offers classes on this camera for free, so there is no reason to not learn to use it.  Do invest in a hard sided case for it, an extra battery and charger. Lastly, it fits in my purse, and I don't carry a huge purse.Only down side, it does take getting use to. It is a computer and not a simple point and shoot. But what a way to go!", "Date": "August 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "M.

It has to be the easiest digital camera to use than any I've owned or used. I get more use from this camera simply because it is truly a pocket sized camera and I carry it with me most of the time. The huge 3\" LCD display is one of the most outstanding features. Its battery is strong and has not let me down yet. The camera is much quicker to use than the low resolution camera built into my cel phone. The video and audio quality is very good. This feature packed camera is one of the best values out there.", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Some good features, but some major deal breakers.", "Author": "Scott Rose \"Computer Geek\"", "ReviewID": "REVRYRNDWVUNO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is not a digital camera that I would recommend to anybody. Although there are a few good features, there are some MAJOR dealbreakers with this camera.  Then again, what would you expect from a company that specializes in printers, not digital cameras?First, the good news:1. Incredibly fast. You can take a photo in less than 1 second of turning this camera on. I have not seen this with any other digital cameras on the market. It is also ready to take additional photos almost instantaneously after taking the previous photos. Very nice speed.2. Beautiful large gorgeous screen, with full-text paragraphs explaining key features of the camera. This is is so invaluable.Now the bad news:1. Notice where the flash is located -- it is RIGHT UNDERNEATH the shutter button that you press every time you want to take a photo. What this means is that your right hand will almost always be blocking the flash when it goes off, unless you are CONSCIOUSLY AWARE about twisting your fingers & your hand to NOT block the flash.2. The flash is NOT POWERFUL at all... it can barely light up an object that is 5 feet away.  And unlike most other digital cameras on the market, there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to alter the brightness of the flash.3. Because the flash is not powerful at all, ALL indoor pictures come out EXTREMELY DARK and nighttime pictures outside are completely out-of-the-question.  This has not happened with any of my other digital cameras that I have owned -- this if the first camera that is completely disappointing in these regards. This makes this camera basically unusable to us. We took 3 photos side-by-side with 2 other digital cameras in the same indoor room, and the other cameras resulted in clear, bright photos.  Not this one. This one's photos came out dark & unusable.4. You're not going to believe this, but you can NOT download your photos from this digital camera to your computer without lugging along the 4-piece DOCK that comes with the camera!!! That's right -- you have to log along a 4-piece Dock (one plastic mounting piece, one plastic docking station, and 2 power cables)!  I have never seen another digital camera like this before! You can not simply bring along a tiny USB cable to connect this to your computer, so it makes this camera much less portable than any other digital camera on the market.5. Furthermore, you also can not recharge the battery in this camera without lugging along the 4-piece dock as well.  Unless you're interested in purchasing a $80 battery recharger kit  for this camera that they sell at Best Buy & other electronics stores, you will be stuck lugging along this 4-piece dock with you wherever you go.6. If you're planning on taking brief movies with the built-in videocamera, prepare for your videos to be jerky & very dimly lit. Granted, this isn't a dedicated videocamera, but still I've seen much better video quality from other digital cameras on the market.7. Finally, above all else, the only thing that really matters is how GOOD your photographs turn out, right? Well unfortunately, every single photograph taken with this camera (even the ones in bright daylight) come out incredible SOFT. The photos are not sharp or clear at all.  It's just so disheartening.I can not recommend this camera to anyone.  I'm sad that I even purchased it.  This camera is poor all the way around.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "HP R927", "Author": "M. Maffei \"Technigirl\"", "ReviewID": "R1OOQ5HTXF3OPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already had the HP R707 (one of their first generations of the R family) so I knew that with the product description what I was getting. And I got a bundle of fun.I know that there are a lot of people out there who bashed this camera because it doesn't do everything and doesn't take very good pictures that aren't sharp, or show weird pixelation. I think there is a problem with the user because I have used Olympus's, Nikons, and the such. I still prefer the HP line. There are lots of settings you can apply to get the camera to take pictures how you want to. You can control appature speed, you can change what type of lighting you are in. You can have the camera take the picture in 3 different ways. There are endless possibilities.The thing with the shape of the camera and covering the flash with you finger is not a problem. The shape of the camera fits your hand well to make you hold the camera properly and to get a steadier picture. Its actually really comfortable too.On the flash is too weak, that user had said that about another camera too.I LOVE the artistic affects you can do. At first I thought it would be terrible, but you can make some hysterical pictures with the kaleidoscope.The charging dock isn't that bad. Its smaller than having to carry around a charger with a huge block for a adapter.If you don't like the way that HP software transfers the images there is a lot easier way to do it. Remove the SD card from the camera. Insert the card into a card reader (many cpu's have them built in). Go to the drive and copy or move the images to the desired location.I have always used the panoramic and the program stitches it up pretty good too. I have so many stadium shots that are really cool with it.The video mode is good for what it is. I didn't buy a digital camera to take a movie, but it has been a good bonus to have. Especially when you can save a frame as an image.The battery in my last HP will still last a long time. You just have to remember to charge it up at least once a month like any battery.I love this camera and for the price here at amazon, why would you spend $350 on something that can do the same/almost as much.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, easy to use", "Author": "neone", "ReviewID": "R1V41ANE6IVI7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As soon as you charge the battery for the first time, you can take a picture.  The quick start guide has all the information you need to perform all the common tasks with the camera.  You can use the camera as a simple point and shoot, or take advantage of all its features.  You can snap pictures less than 2 seconds apart.  Great clarity until you reduce the megapixels too much with the digital zoom, but the camera tells you what your current mp level is, so you can monitor the quality before you snap.  I recommend an extra battery and a card with plenty of extra memory so you can snap unlimited photos then pick and choose later.  Only drawback is that the latch for the battery/memory door requires some dexterity to open and close.  If you have clumsy fingers, you'll want to try to open the latch on a demo before you buy it.

No more carrying the instructions book and frantically trying to find how to perform some functions.  Now one can frantically go throgh all the steps on the screen until the function is found.So far I am satisfied with the camera, I have not used it long enough to run out of battery and I bought a spare to keep with me at all times when that does happen.  The memory in the camera is inadequate except for an emergency, but a 2 Gig card has taken care of that.I have not gotten used to using to screen for shooting pictures as yet, I hope that by the end of vacation this month I have mastered the techniques for doing that.

The cradle is lightweight and easy to carry. I really do not see a problem with that.The only big problem I have is you have to be steady or you will get a foggy photo, I use a tripod most of the time and the pictures comes out perfect. The smaller problems with me is some of the buttons on top, I have had problem pushing these when taken a freehand shot, also when you are using Anti red eye or some of the other features this camera has It slows down the shots.I am rating this 3 stars only because of this camera not having a anti-shake mode.

I ordered the camera one morning and received it the next day. Now that is service.Now for the camera, I bought it as a gift for a first time digital camera user and I have to say the camera not only is easy to use but fun. I almost kept the camera for myself. The picture quality is a lot better than I expected. The pictures are very clear and sharp. The camera is used mainly indoors at family get togethers and I haven't seen a bad picture yet.If you are looking for a small camera that is easy to use and takes good pictures this camera is for you. It also has some fun photo imaging that you can play with on the camera however I have noticed it drains the battery fairly quickly. Overall I would recommend this camera.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "troubled!", "Author": "WARDAH HAQQ", "ReviewID": "R1GH6G8D1PFA4D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera has a slight opening on the top as id pried or picked.

I'd suggest you get a small camera ipod for this so that you'll be guaranteed good pics too.

Fits in shirt pocket.2.Clear pictures.  Good color and sharpness.3.Has great megapixels! More than ample.4.Has lots of nice features.Down side:  1.Unbalanced design.  Fits in one hand, but wants to fall off to one side when in position to shoot.  One hand operation is awkward.  Can't hold it, zoom it, use feature buttons, and still maintain balance to shoot.  Needs strap and awkward finger placements to help keep it level for one hand use.2.Slow, sloow, slooow......!3.Cumbersome download.  Needs recharger dock to download pics.  That wasn't obvious in the product description.4.No viewfinder.  That was not obvious in product description, either.  Must rely only on screen display.

Even if the battery would have charge, the charging process was bad.  That is because the camera's design required the camera to be placed in a two-piece plastic cradel in order to charge.

The charger was not sold without the other items. At that point, I just returned the product.However, the good point was the service from Beach Camera. After returning the camera, Beach promptly refunded the price of the camera and the shipping charges.

Although the camera has the potential to take great shots (and i have taken a few that people dont even beleive was done with this camera)it doesnt satisfy my expectations.  The docking station is a pain in the butt and the camera now takes me over 12 hours to charge.  It only works when it wants to (the camera, and the docking station). At one point i wanted to find a waterproof casing and found it close to impossible.  The casing i found was a waste of money.
