Zhang \"Kathy Zhang55\"", "ReviewID": "R1RMJ9TYNRFFIM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to buy this camera since last year because it is small but powerful.This package is a great deal. Each small box is packed carefully and the tripod is big, not a toy.I give 4 star because the CD is on the picture but not in the box. I contacted the seller and I was told that it is not availabe and I needed to download. If it is not available, they should update the photo instead of miss leading customers.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent quality but complicated", "Author": "Judy W.", "ReviewID": "R3LB8NCC63XF9F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We selected this camera because we were pleased with our eleven year old Sony with a Carl Zeiss lens and thought the larger sensor would allow us to take photos in low light conditions without flash. This camera is much smaller than our previous camera which makes it easy to carry along. When I first looked at the instruction booklet and tried to utilize all the features  I was flummoxed by the complexity. My son advised me to try one new thing each day which was helpful advise. I am still in the \"getting used to it\" stage and realizing that there are some features that I may never use. I may have purchased a camera that is far above my ability and perhaps could have settled for a less expensive model. That said, the camera produces excellent photos. I recently captured dancers moving on an outdoor stage at night. The results were not grainy and were well focused even with the movement. So the camera and I are friends and I look forward to getting to know it better.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pocket rocket and great accessory package", "Author": "J.
