For example, to mount this camera outside my front door I would have to drill through the house, find a compatible cord that long, then plug into a convenient(sarcasm)outlet and try and hide the cord. Problem two is it turns off with a power outage and doesn't turn back on by itself. Another problem is the motion detector is too sensitive. It records and records till it fills up the memory card. It's time consuming to sift through a mere hour of memory. I want to add that you can supposedly set the program to erase earlier recordings once the memory card becomes full, but this is not working, so my little card fills up in a matter of an hour. I don't dare buy a bigger card.A couple of these problems are fixable, but the motion detectorbeing too sensitive and the system not erasing earlier recordings when full is a deal breaker! I might try and adjust the camera to look at a stationary part of my deck out back, but the field of view might be limited. Seriously though a moth flies by and its on camera! Too sensitive! buy a better system that doesn't have these flaws!", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is NOT a reliable SECURITY device.", "Author": "lowepa", "ReviewID": "RS6UIK4WY48A9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Set up this system and tested it several times connected to a video display (TV).It worked, and we could see clearly persons in the camera view even in dim light.However, with the \"Arm\" button always glowing red on the receiver, it was hard to know whether the system was \"armed\" or not!  Next texted the system NOT hooked toa video device. Was unable to read the tested results either from the receiver hooked up to a TV or by reading from my computer (even downloaded software as SWANN recommended).  My thought was that should we need to read the SD if we had a breakin, someone surely would be able to read the SD.  What happened next, however,did not occur to us...we left for a 2 week trip the day before hurricane Irene arrived in our area.  The electric went out...no big deal, we have a large, whole-house automatic generator that kicks on in 15 seconds.  What we forgot was that theSWANN \"security\" system would have to be physically turned on again and armed.Bottom line I am ready to return this system for something we can rely on when we're not home!!!  Two calls to SWANN did not help in being able to read theSanDisk Ultra 32GB card.  Having just returned from vacation, I have not yet called SWANN for their comments.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motion sensor too sensitive", "Author": "Ronald L Waters", "ReviewID": "R4T6UM232CJ5K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera system would be be decent if the motion detector was not so sensitive. I called tech suppport and they said there is no way to adjust it. It fills up the SD card in less than 1 day.

Bradley", "ReviewID": "RDW211KVJWYJP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had mine two and a half stories up on my house for almost two years. It still works great BUT, it is slowly starting to get moister leaks in the front where the cam is and the inferred lights that really don't see anything unless you have flood lights to back it up at night. The moister leaks have shorted out the inferred lights for night vision but the cam is still going, for how long I don't know. I will say it has been through some very heavy and intense rain storms along with high winds. I would rather say moister leaking into front of cam when it rains for days.Otherwise it is ok. I bought a second cam only to find out you can only record with one cam at a time to an SD card. You can have from four cams but after you have more than one cam online you can't record  all of them, ONLY ONE CAM!!!Do yourself a favor, spend another two or three hundred bucks and buy a non wireless cam that is not plastic. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!This cam has always given a clear picture, the mic is for crap unless your standing under it with a megaphone. Well actually the mic picks up car engines almost three blocks away coming down the road. After two years i can tell a ford, toyota, chevy coming before the cam see's it! Big deal!It works but if I where you, I would spend more money.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "not usefull", "Author": "lb7788", "ReviewID": "R120OA04FLQUPY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1. auto delete function does not work2. once power is off, not able to restart when power is back, have to restart it manually.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does what it is supposed to do.", "Author": "TriciaH", "ReviewID": "RVLK5TWVKRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We chose this one not only for the price but for the ease of installation.
