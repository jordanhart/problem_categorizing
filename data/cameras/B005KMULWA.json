Your signal will suffer with poor quality wire. I find the copper wire is so thin when I cut it to connect.  The video image is blurry with this 100ft cable after I connected it to my CCTV camera.  I was so disappointed. I wouldn't recommend others order anything from this company.The cable can't work well. It gave us a very blurry picture. It have problem with distortion and drop of in power. You get what you pay!Buyer Beware!!!!!!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$51.00", "Features": "All-in-one video and power cable\nPlug and Play ready\n4 Pack of 100 feet video/power cables in white", "Name": "4 Pack of 100ft 100 Feet All-In-One Siamese Video and Power BNC Cable for CCTV Security Camera Surveillance System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41crCJCx2kL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005KMULWA"}}
