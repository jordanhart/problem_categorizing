Benenson", "ReviewID": "R1L8AAJ69ZVSVE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is probably a great camera for people who just need a point and shoot to take snapshots now and then, and the front-facing LCD is handy if you can deal with its quirks.But after having it a few months I'm just not that impressed. Here's what I don't like:- Wimpy battery - on my last outing it conked out after about 110 shots, none with flash, only a handful with both front and rear LCD on, and with the battery fully charged the night before.- The front LCD is a hassle to use; it always starts up in a mode where it only will automatically shoot when it detects a smile, and it's touch-sensitivity is pretty poor.- Macro mode (close-up) doesn't work very well, many shots end up out of focus.- The USB/charging cable is a proprietary cable, so that's one more cable to keep track of and maybe lose.On the upside, there are some pluses which could make up for the problems for a lot of folks:- If you must have a camera with a front LCD, this is one of the few out there. The front LCD will even show funny faces accompanied by silly noises to get kids to smile.- It's small and light.- The lens doesn't extend/retract, so it's less likely to get damaged.- It has a lot of scene modes.- It charges from USB.- The pictures look fine, but like most point-and-shoots, they are a tiny bit overexposed if you use auto mode.P.S. Before getting this camera I was quite happy with my Canon SD1200IS, but I really wanted a front LCD to take those occasional shots of me and my partner on vacation kind of stuff. Unfortunately, about the *only* thing this Samsung has over the Canon is the front LCD (and more megapixels, though that's not as important to me). In other respects I think the Canon's superior.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for the casual or everyday user!", "Author": "Iron Man \"JON\"", "ReviewID": "R3I9D0YEHS1S75", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung ST100 is a great little camera for the casual or everyday user. This was bought primarily for my teen-age daughter who loves taking pictures and posting them on social networking sites. Besides the camera in her cell phone, she wanted a dedicated camera to just lug around and take pictures in the conventional way. So I was given the task of the selection process (not to mention the purchasing part too) for her. Nowadays, the main component problem that arises from compact digital cameras are the zoom lenses. After continued vigorous use, the zooming mechanism has the tendency to wear out. When this happens, you have a camera slated for expensive repairs because although it does power on, the lens will neither extend outward nor retract inwards because the mechanism has failed. The brilliant solution would be to have a fixed, zoomable lens, no outward/inward motion where the mechanism will wear out from use. Before finally settling for the ST100, I also had my sights on the Fujifilm Finepix Z90, a camera in the same class and size: touch-screen, fixed lens having the same resolution (14MP) and maginification (5x), able to take 720p video, except that the Finepix has a retractable lens cover which also serves as the power on/off mechanism and a slightly smaller 3-inch LCD screen. The Finepix was around 40 bucks cheaper than the ST100 but what really drew me to the Samsung was the 1.8-inch front LCD screen. Teen-agers nowadays loves to take pictures of themselves and having the ability to see what you are doing with a front LCD pretty much enhances the appeal of the ST100. The front LCD can either be powered on with a button on top of the camera or just by a tap on the screen. The tapping is a little annoying. Whereas the main LCD is very sensitive, the front requires you to tap it with a little force. I guess this is where it needs a little improvement. The front screen does not always turn on or off with a single tap. There are other brands out there that has the touch screen capability but ONLY Samsung came up with the idea to add an extra LCD screen on the front. This makes it unique and a class of its own. The main LCD touch screen has clear sound and feedback so you will definitely know if you are or have touched the screen and activated a function. It has a P setting (Program) for the above average user where you can manipulate shutter speed and aperture for truly creative photos. It also has different settings for face detection. The pictures are pretty decent but since teen-agers aren't dedicated photographers, the end result satisfies the means. Do not expect to have breath-taking photos with the ST100. That's better left off with DSLR's. Compact camera's in this class and category are for casual users only. In summary, the reasons why I like this camera:Pros:3.5-inch WVGA LCD touch screen display with clear feedback14.2MP resolution, 5X magnificationFixed-lens, dual LCDAble to take 720p HD-quality video at 30 frames/secImage StabilizationIntuitive operation, not a lot of learning curve to doDifferent settings for different usesVery compact, can easily fit in your pocketCons:Front LCD screen does not always respond to a tapthe body of the camera is shiny glossy, very prone to smudges and scratches(they did include a soft cloth to solve the smudging problem)The power/USB cord is very short and proprietary (exclusive to Samsung)(you cant just buy a longer cord, its not going to be compatible)The battery charge doesn't last very long. You might want to buy a spare justin case you'll be using it, for example a whole day. Although it almost hasno moving parts, the high-resolution LCD just uses too much powerOther than my gripes, I as a middle-aged adult, found the camera to be so much fun to use, almost as fun as my DSLR. When my daughter finally got this, it was picture-taking galore to no-end! 4-star rating is the most I can come up with.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung ST100", "Author": "Tommy83", "ReviewID": "R3KO00NRZD28CT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a gift and I must say it does a pretty good job at taking pictures.

Easy to use for basic photos, it gave good results in untalented hands. The only thing that might have helped was an audio input jack for an external mike to give clearer voices in the videos.Today I sadly found the weak point. The case, with the camera inside, fell about a foot and a half onto a floor, and now it won't work. It is not competely dead, but the pictures come out strangely on viewing -- they are all streaky - beautiful really -- with green or red bars running across the screen and gaps between. You can make out shadowy images, but it is not a clear photo. Sometimes the power switch won't turn off the camera and I have to take out the battery to shut it down.It may have just hit an unluckey point on the camera, but if this fragility is general, the camera is very vulnerable to knocks and short falls. Even though it was protected by the case, it still broke....perhaps the case should be improved to absorb more shock.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "patical", "Author": "Galaxy", "ReviewID": "R1XMTO53H118KB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camara for its front camara display, it performs great and its a good size.

That part of the camera works fine. However, if you are looking for a camera with extremely crisp images, this is NOT the one for you. Even when the focus has locked on a subject, quite often the results are somewhat blurry, or 'soft' at the very least. Even when the subject is sitting perfectly still in bright light, the softness still occurs. Perhaps this has to do with the fixed lens? I'm not sure... Also, many times the colors are not as vivid as in real life, and the flash (even when 'dialed down) often washes color out unacceptably. Additionally, it takes a tad longer than other point-and-shoots to focus and then finally capture the image-- meaning a LOT of missed moments. I love the overall concept of the dual screens, but the unnecessary trade-off of low quality pics is just not acceptable. I end up wanting to to throw the camera more often than not... ended up buying a Canon sx230 for just about the same amount of money (the most recent version is the Canon sx260), as my last Canon took beautiful pics.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "i bought this for my woman because i am awesome !!!", "Author": "Kabol, Johnathan N. \"rhetorics\"", "ReviewID": "R3CKPO4C136L6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "went from a kodak m1063, that we loved a few years ago.  but wife hated getting confused by the settings and the ergonomic placement of the controls made for more frustration than not.  for her.  so i went for simple and powerful.  the front display is pretty awesome.  i love that you can activation with a hard tap.  we tend to spend more time together than with friends.  even two weeks ago when we went to cancun with friends, we spent half the time just us, and got some great footage using the front display to keep us in the perimeters before the shot.  just awesome for that.  that function wouldve been very helpful for the photos we made for family at christmas time last year hahai love that it doesnt have to load a lens.  it's stationary.  and the clarity is awesome.  the touch display is awesome.  makes for easy adjusting, unlike the wheel atop our last camera.  much easier and sure when it's a button on a display.i was surprised about the battery life, the only thing that wasnt way above par.  i expected it to last days.  it loses a bar after half a day of use.  that's still great, but i expected it to last something like forever, especially since there is no retracting lens.  must be the touch display lcd screen.  worth it, though, for the awesome display.  i ordered another battery and a wall charger.  concern solved.takes a micro sd card.  i was surprised.  unfortunately, there is no mini hdmi slot.  that was a hope, squashed.  but the compact flash is awesome.  definitely goes farther and clearer than any digital camera ive used before.i couldnt be happier with the purchase.  no more of the wife getting frustrated and thrusting a camera in my face saying \"fix it!\" awwahaha everything you need to work the camera is on top right.  on/off, shutter button, zoom, and preview all right there.  no looking, very easy.also, tech stuff:  ive not used camera software to transfer photos in many years.  i use card readers.  but with the micro sd card that is hard to pinch out, i tried the usb cable that came with the phone.  very easy to use.  no worries.here's [if it works] two links to two pictures, side by side from the same seat at the same place using only auto flash.  just to give perspective on the difference from the last to the new one:[...]just click on the photo to change from the new bright capture to the older [camera] kinda grainy picturethe difference in cameras over just the last few years is amazing !!update:christmas pictures were easier.  set it for a ten second delay and the entire family huddles in.  it counts down the last few seconds for you on the front lcd display.  very easy to see, that is a very cool function.weve had this camera for more than half a year now and it is still awesome.  the stabilization function is singularly awesome.  taking pictures of birds in our back yard is pretty fun at full zoom.  no flash, full zoom, and hold the shutter most of the way down, everything is so stable i can capture every part of the image i want.the battery does go fast so definitely have back ups.  we have two back ups and a wall charger.  it's a lot of camera, there's a lot of processing with each shot.  and it's very worth it.p.s., i love the touch screen.  there is a delay with the touch screen, but for the photos we capture, it is worth it.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "nicely done", "Author": "carltonzrad90", "ReviewID": "R36M2ISX9SBHDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is everything that i wanted. the zoom is alright, and the quality of the picture taken is awesome.
