Takes a while to get used to the EXTENSIVE feature set.  Doing a lot more than my alpha 300.  Totally different experience.  I like all the extra buttons and displays but have to master them.Not a five star yet due to still getting to know the camera.  Have read a 600 page book on this camera and still GETTING to know it.Much better pictures, bokeh better.  Images Sharper, focusing more precise, love the hdr etc.  Have not used the movie side yet.Well worth the money.Only negative is that it is heavy and bulky.Still love the camera after 3 months, taking the best pic I have ever taken.the stuff in the kit is cheap, not worth much so don't buy it for the kit.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,129.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony Alpha A77 SLT-A77VM A77VM SLTA77 SLTA77VM 24.3 MP Translucent Mirror Digital SLR With 18-135mm lens ULTIMATE BUNDLE with High Speed 32GB Card, 3 pc Deluxe Filter Kit, High Capacity Spare Battery, Padded Case+ More!", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OljY0c%2BQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0085VSUC6"}}
