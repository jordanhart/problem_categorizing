Useless camera, even worse bells and whistles.", "Author": "sdcanuck", "ReviewID": "R380RTFJK66V0G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera back in June just before I went on a 3-week vacation that included a wedding and a two week bicycling tour. I did a fair amount of window shopping before deciding upon this camera. I was extremely excited about the GPS functionality and the rugged design.After only a day or two of use, I was displeased with the camera's performance (sluggishness, long GPS tracking time, heavy drain on the battery, sub-par picture quality, poor scene selection under automatic mode, etc.), but I had no choice but to continue to use it since I had already started my vacation.Now that I've had the camera for over a month and I've tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, I've decided that this is the worst camera I have ever purchased. The extremely poor functionality of GPS aside, this camera is unable to take a decent picture. Even in decent lighting, photos come out blurry. For the $200+ I spent on this camera, I could have purchased any number of other cameras and would have been far happier with the picture quality.The GPS tracking can often take more than 5 minutes, even when the camera is an open area with no obstructions. This shortcoming caused me much frustration every time I pulled out the camera on the road trip, hoping to capture a picture complete with GPS data only to be forced to wait 5 minutes for the tracking to occur. Sometimes the camera's GPS didn't even track after 5 minutes. And to leave the tracking 'on' drains the batteries to the point where they last less than 8 hours without taking any pictures, and even then there is no guarantee that the tracking would even work. The GPS function on this camera leaves much to be desired.I consider myself a photography enthusiast. I have owned dozens of cameras in my life (point-and-shoot, SLR, film, digital). I typically lean towards Nikon products, but I've owned digital point-and-shoots from Nikon, Pentax, Casio and this Fuji XP30 the worst of the lot of them. Every time I pull the camera out to take a picture, I cringe as I imagine what the result will be when I download the images to my computer.I returned the camera for a refund.

The menu options are clear and easy to understand. I do have a couple of complaints though:The GPS seems to take a while to get a lock. (You can continue to shoot, but the photos you take until it gets a lock will not be geo-tagged.)I was disappointed that you cannot charge the battery through the USB connection. This would be a great camera for the outdoor enthusiast, but you can't couple it with a solar battery charger so you have to carry extra batteries.There is no lens cover so you'll want to watch out when throwing the camera in your pack or pocket.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not buy, trust me", "Author": "Bret O Sassenberg", "ReviewID": "R1PH6NDS66YZBG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Vacation in Italy was destroyed as far as pictures go when the door opened underwater.

It takes great pictures underwater. It took great pictures but on one of the snorkeling trips the battery died. Later when I charged the battery the camera wouldn't boot again...whatever happened to it I don't know but it was bricked. I ended up returning it to Amazon (one of the reasons I love to buy from Amazon) and requesting a replacement because it indeed did do what it is supposed to do - take pictures underwater (waterproof). I just received my replacement camera too.Now for the picture quality - low light performance is average. The SR-Auto setting is useful and recognizes the scenes well and automatically switches from portrait to landscape/scenic to underwater and night light shooting modes. You get good pictures with just point and shoot. (Remember this is not a professional camera - far from it) The GPS location setting is also useful - although indoors it cannot find the satellite so it drains the battery. The outdoor performance is excellent - color saturation is very good and produced some good detail and good colors.. flash is small for any night time shooting unless the subject is close.Form factor is perfect - fits in the hand well and you can swim with it.Battery life however is poor...with a fully charged battery it leaves much to be desired as the battery dies out fast especially if the GPS is on and the flash is used...On one of our day trips we took about 20 pictures before the low battery indicator started showing up and we had to conserve battery. Comparing this to my Canon point and shoot that thing lasts much longerGood and a cheap camera for some great underwater pictures and outdoor pictures - since it is rugged (shockproof, dust proof, waterproof etc) I want to keep this in my backpack...if you are looking for a professional camera with lots of settings to change when taking pictures then look elsewhere ...for some candid pictures on the beach, water, etc it is very handy because you don't need to worry about sand/dust/water getting into the camera and it does take good pictures", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY - Honeymoon Pictures Ruined!", "Author": "Fabry \"fabe_27\"", "ReviewID": "RYKMC9MQC5NXS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wish I didn't have to write this...We were given this camera as a gift for our honeymoon (11/13/11-11/20/11) in Cancun.

It took OK pictures but night pictures were always shocking even with the night setting on. I took it under water for the first time in December 2010 and it was fine til about the third time when it filled with water. The quality of underwater photos were not great even though it was used in Coral Bay (Western Australia) where the waters are pristine. Fuji replaced it in April 2011 (took 6 weeks turn around!). Again it was used underwater in December 2011(summer in Australia)and while it did not fill with water this time the buttons all started to sieze. I couldn't delete photos. Then the click button for taking pictures became erratic, having to be nursed along to take a picture. It felt like there may have been sand in there (voiding the \"dust proof\" claim). Yesterday the \"ON/OFF\" button froze completely. When I turn on the button it freezes the operating system inside and the only way of turning it off is to remove the battery. Today I returned it again and await Fuji's decision on a replacement. I do not want a replacement of this camera again but feel I may have no choice. However I would NOT reccommend anyone buy this camera.It must be said I didn't buy this through Amazon.com but felt a review of it would be helpful for Amazon customers.

Didn't know if it was the camera, the battery, or the charger. So I decided to just by a new camera. This was the camera I came upon. I bought it in December 2011. I took it with me on my honeymoon to Hawaii. It did amazing. We went to the beach, we went snorkeling, we went up to the top of the volcano, no problems at all. The battery life was awesome. When I would use it a lot daily (like when I was in Hawaii) I only had to charge it every 2 days. And I take a LOT of  pictures. Lol. Sadly, I lost my camera down a river this last weekend. Have to wait until I have the money to buy a new one, but I'll definitely go with this one again. I'm definitely going to buy a strap for it that floats. Already found a great one on Amazon for $7. I also have a tendency to drop things, and this camera is definitely shock proof. Just a warning if you are looking into this camera, this is the only camera I've ever had where the door for the battery compartment does not latch by itself when you shut it, so you have to move the latch to lock it. It should be easy to see though as it is bright yellow when it is not closed all the way. Also, the GPS takes a long time (around 2-3 mins) to find the location, and I've heard that it can drain your battery, but you can shut it off in the settings.

Like other people who have reviewed this product, I can also confirm that this camera is NOT WATERPROOF. The first time I took it into the water (snorkelling) the LCD screen went funny and stopped working. I sent it back to Fuji under warranty and they promptly replaced it with a new one, however not in the color I originally bought, and also all the shipping was at my own expense and it took weeks to get my new one. The second one stopped working after taking it on a wet motorcycle trip through the rainforest. I noticed the LCD screen had condensation inside and then the zoom and some other buttons stopped working. When I sent this one back Fuji determined it was due to water damage.

Wang \"jwangamazon\"", "ReviewID": "RDNKS9ZKDKHZX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got the Fuji XP20 mainly for taking videos in conditions that my Canon HD camcorder can not. On my first usage in a river rafting event, I already see the problems with this camera:1) I am experienced with Camera and camcorders, I know how to hold them properly. But the lens head is placed in a very awkward place, your fingers will easily cover part of the lens head. So, don't be surprised to see your fingers in the final photos and video clips. It's almost for sure that you will not get photos or videos of yourself. Because other people may not be able to hold this camera properly to take yours.2) Hard to fine tune the zoom speed. Not convenient, but I can live with that.3) The camera won't focus while zooming (it will focus after zooming stops). This is a typical issue with non-DSLR camera in video mode. I saw the same thing in Panasonic camera also. Not a big issue to me.4) This is the biggest flaw, the audio is not in sync with the video. I have to turn off the audio from the video clips, and add background music when producing the final movie for the rafting trip. Even my simple Flip video camera handle this better than this Fuji camera.5) The video quality is no way to compare with regular HD camcorder. The image is kind of grainy, even at 1pm strong sunshine with good light. Again, I can accept this since I am in a condition (around water) where normal camcorder can not be used.6) Indoor photo quality is no way to compare with my 5-year-old 5MP Panasonic camera.But this is OK to me since I am in a condition (around water) where my normal camera can not be used.If this is the only camera you want to have, I won't recommend this. However, if your intend is \"ONLY\" to take photos, videos in conditions where your normal gears can not, then I think this Fuju XP20 is acceptable....if you don't mind the out-of-sync audio problem.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "okay for what it is", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R1BPR517XAWG44", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my dive trips....
