It isn't going to be perfect and isn't going to please those that want a professional camera in a compact digital size and price.Be reasonable, ask yourself what you are buying the camera for.Here is my experience.  I love this camera (s-7) because I take it everywhere, and it takes great pictures.  I even have several on my wall blown up to 20 x 30 size framed and it looks great but it is probably on the limit of it's capability at that size.  I mostly use it for 8x10 and smaller and it is more than great for that.  I had an S-4 and it lasted 3 years, the S-7 has lasted almost 2 years now until I cracked it open on a rock but that isn't it's fault.  I take it everywhere with me (I keep it in a leather the Pentax leather case).  I love to travel and have traveled to humid, hot, cold environments.  I have run with it in my hand for several marathons, and have ridden over 4000 miles on my mountian bike with it in my sweaty back pocket in rough single track on races and several crashes.  One reviewer indicated that it felt plastic like.  I don't think so but maybe it is.  All I know is I have been hard on mine.  I bought a digital point and shoot because it was small and cheap so I could take it everywhere with me and not feel bad if I broke it, and I found out it takes better pictures than I expected.  I am totally happy with it.  I crashed and broke it almost in half so I need to get another camera now.  I am debating about buying another S-7 or plumping for an S-12.  I have a wall full of pictures that testifies that it is a pretty good camera.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "SLOW!!!!!", "Author": "janie werner", "ReviewID": "R3G38NBQ0FJO03", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am generally happy with the camera and quality of the pictures, but the start up time and the shutter lag are some of the slowest I've seen.  My family has 6 p/s cameras from all different manufacters and this Optio is the worst.I just don't understand why the companies promote \"face recognition system\", \"anti shake\",and high megamixel when what we really want is a camera that will take a shot when you press the button!", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "fab cam", "Author": "Jay-G \"JG\"", "ReviewID": "R22AKUC41OHJON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.

Dykstra", "ReviewID": "R2JR9YT7K16QXQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought one of these here on Amazon as a supplement to my Pentax Digital SLR. I wanted a low-cost, small camera to carry around in situations where I didn't need the quality or flexibility of the big camera. Since this is a somewhat older model, I assume most people interested in buying one wouldn't necessarily be looking for the latest, cutting-edge camera but rather something decent at a good price. Many of the reviews speak highly of the picture quality or features of the camera while pointing out that there is an issue with the speed at which the shutter trips. I have not had the camera long enough to really put it to the test in all situations, but I have a similar take on it. I love the small size, solid feel, range of options and apparent battery life. I also admit that in some cases you have to hold the shutter button for a bit before it takes a picture and that in some situations, such as low-light settings, it can be hard to get a good, in-focus picture. That being said, it seems to me that this camera has a very fast start-up and shut down time and the shutter lag isn't that big a deal once you get used to it. I certainly wouldn't say it's a substitute for my SLR in most situations, but for most point-and-shoot situations, it does the job. There are endless choices in small cameras out there nowadays. To me, the reasons for considering this one are the Pentax reputation for quality, the compact size and the currently-reasonable prices.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Aggravating", "Author": "MyoungU \"MyoungU\"", "ReviewID": "RY73Y12LMJYRQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The shutter lag on this camera is so bad that Pentax has disgraced its good name by putting this camera on the market.  Just how bad is the shutter lag?  If you ask a stranger who is unfamiliar with the camera to take a picture for you, nine times out of ten you end up with no picture at all.  Why?  The stanger pressed the button just like you said, but failed to hold the button down for the three seconds or so that the camera needs to take the picture.  Yes, it is that bad -- and even worse when the camera needs to flash.  I hate this camera.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "An Altoid box of utility and fun", "Author": "Leo Ingle \"one hand clapping\"", "ReviewID": "R1PCWKQ4VTX97O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera, which does fit in an Altoid box, has been a pocket companion of mine, ever since I bought it to replace my Pentax Optio S4.  Yes, it is slow to the starting gate, but, in the bracketing or burst mode, there is some relief from this problem.  That slowness cost it five stars from me.  Intuitive controls, easy to learn.  Great color.  Prints are excellent.  Low light and bright light handled about average.  I'm a Canon fan for larger point and shoots, and have a digital Minolta SLR (yes, I know, they went out of business)--but this little charmer is what I carry day to day.", "Date": "June 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great to carry everywhere", "Author": "Russell A.

And, the Pentax name.  I will attest as do others, it DOES fit in an altoid can.  And, for the most part, when I carry it in my pocket I have it in the altoid can.  It is 100% protected from pocket knife, keys, etc.  Others have reviewed that it is slow.  But, I haven't seen that to be a too big of a problem.  It's true..but not a terrible problem.  If you want speed...spend $400 more and get what you want.  I know this probably goes with all electronics, but my wife dropped my camera with the lens open and it messed it up pretty good.  It wouldn't work any more.  So, durability it doesn't have from a 4' drop to the ground.  But, to let you know how much I like the camera...I ordered another that very day!", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very small but not always the greatest photos", "Author": "M.

It takes pretty good pictures outdoors and in bright light but it definitely has it's limitations.  Forget about catching anything in action/sport mode.  The flash is weak and night time or low light pictures don't come out so great.  I will keep this camera because it comes in handy when you're going to the amusement park or the beach and don't want to lug around a larger camera.  I will use my advanced point and shoot (Kodak z812) or my DSLR (Olympus E420) instead when I want to make sure that I get some good photos.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "The image quality of 7.0 effective megapixels permits beautiful, crisp prints even at large-format sizes\nStylish and slim compact body - New Blur Reduction High ISO mode reduces camera shake and subject blurring - Supports the SDHC memory card for greater storage of high-quality images and longer movies\nFace Recognition AF & AE for beautiful one-step portraits - Auto-tracking AF continuously focuses on a moving subject\nHigh-quality movies with an anti-shake function - Auto Picture mode automatically determines the best settings for the shooting conditions\nIncludes the ACDSee for PENTAX image viewer/image management softwareSupports PictBridge, DPOF functions, Exif Print, and PRINT Image Matching", "Name": "Pentax Optio S7 Digital Camera 7MP 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JAS48zLiL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000I3ZDEC"}}
