{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic Entry Level DSLR", "Author": "Evil Von Der Scratchy", "ReviewID": "R1NQHFZRHI7FF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did hours of research before purchasing the Nikon D3200 with the 18-55mm standard lens along with the additional 55-200mm lens.  I am far from an expert with any kind of SLR camera, having only experience with the normal point and shoot variety.  I didn't want to shell out excessive amounts of money for a camera that would overwhelm me.I was interested in being able to continue taking the quick snapshots that I usually do with my point and shoot, but also extend my ability to control more aspects of my pictures outside of just pressing the shutter button.  I really wanted to have the ability to dictate exactly what would go into a photo that I take, what parts of it would be in focus or out of focus, and also be able to really extend the zoom range for distances I could never get with a basic camera.I was impressed with how easy this camera was to use.  Directly out of the box, without reading any instructions the familiar picture format settings made this camera an easy transition for a rookie like me.  The main dial on the top of the camera has the icons that are recognized easily as the same picture formats that are found on the basic camera so I could just turn the dial and fly between Automatic, Portrait, Action, Landscape, and even a new \"Child\" setting just for chasing around my three year old!The lens was easy to manipulate, and with Nikon's \"VR\" or vibration reduction capability built into each lens, the process of bringing a distant shot in close was a snap.  Changing out a lens is a breeze as well.This camera is perfect for anyone like me looking to step up their own photography skills.  I am very happy that I chose this camera for my new adventures.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best DSLR  camera", "Author": "AP", "ReviewID": "R269WI06X4O94L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been close to 4 months or so since I got this product. It's really great DSLR camera.  It has all the features of fancy DSLR at very affordable price.  I compared it with my friend's cannon EOS 60D  and I feel this is way better and is packed with many more features!!  Well if you are a professional photographer who takes pictures for living then you might want to research  but for rest it's perfect camera.I take pictures of my kids in contact sports and pictures are amazing. It takes like 4 frames in a second!!! No blurs or pictures that looks shaken. It  is  24 MP so pictures are fantastic. I think it is probably worth every cent I paid for it so far.Drawback is the zoom is bulky to carry around. It is annoying to carry camera, tripod and zoom around when you travel a lot.

I don't regret it.  The extra resolution of the camera allows a great deal of zooming of the pictures. This allows us to take pics of stuff that is a bit too far away, but still blow it up to a decent picture.There are far more features that I've yet to explore but I look forward to it.The big negative:  I still can't believe they wouldn't include SOME kind of memory card.

This camera performed flawlessly, and produced great pictures. I had previously been a professional photographer, but for several years I have been using a \"point and shoot\". I wanted to get back in to using a higher quality camera, but wanted something that would allow me to easily take control of the settings, and still allow me to use an automatic mode when I needed to shoot quickly. This camera gave me exactly what I wanted.The lenses that were provided were excellent for this price point, producing very sharp pictures, and great color rendition. The autofocus was extremely fast and accurate, and the image stabilization was great (I was able to handhold at 1/15 of a second, even fully zoomed out). The controls are very intuitive after you use it for a little while.The only possible suggestion I could make would be to incorporate the Wi-Fi feature without the need for additional hardware.

First of all I wanted a camera with interchangeable lenses with auto features. I first ordered a similar outfit from another supplier (I would only say its name starts with an A*) except the telephoto lens was not Vibration Reduction (VR) and cost $100 less. Big problem with that supplier was that both the Amazon site and their site listed it as \"In Stock\" so I clicked it. Big mistake! 24 hours later, not a few hours, they sent a note telling the item was out of stock with a non confirmed back-order date. I needed the item sent to my son by Dec 12th, but because he was leaving with no news about my camera, I asked the supplier to send it directly to my office address. Their sales support personnel never responded with a positive response, citing regulations that prevented them to change shipping address and so, and almost the same from Amazon. In the end I found the offer from PixiBytes and contacted them, and they promptly responded the kit was in Stock. I click the order, notify them about it, and the camera kit was picked up by FedEx a few hours later. So, I cancelled the other. When it arrived I had to say this was a Superb Camera for the price! Sorry for Canon, Sony, Panasonic or other brands' lovers, for me Nikon is still the best in semi/pro consumer cameras! I got a meeting later with several friends and they had their Canon's, Pentax's, etc, and they all fell in love with the Nikon D3200. I told them there are others models better, but they like it as it is. Many of them are sure in replacing their older ones with a Nikon soon. Only regret I have from this Nikon is that this type of camera seems it's no longer made in Japan -like my SUV-, it's assembled in Thailand. I guess that is why they can offer a camera like this for this relatively low price. I am happy with it, and it arrived in time for all my Holidays picture taking parties! If you have the bucks you may try the D5200 or even more the D7200. I am very happy with my D3200.

I also have a Canon S110 (also love) for carrying around in my pocket.  I had been thinking about getting the NEX 6 body but was not convinced it was a major step up for the money (although I wanted a viewfinder), and am waiting to see what new products are coming from Sony.  So, I started looking around as I have been wondering for the past year how my NEX stood up against a \"real\" DSLR.  I did the normal Nikon or Canon, if Nikon then the d3200, 5200 or 7100 etc.  I have been partly looking at this as an experiment so went for the cheapest possible body which came with the kit lense and 50-200.  In addition I got the 35mm 1.8G.  I also got the SB400 flash as one of my (few) dislikes of the NEX is the lack of options for flash.It has been an eye opener!  As I said, I love my NEX 5N, but, wow, the D3200 is awesome to use.  First off, I was amazed by the weight - it feels lighter than the NEX.  OK it is bulkier, but not to the point of inconvenience.  It fits in the same waist pouch I use along with the flash and 50-200 zoom - which also feels lighter, and is not much bigger than the NEX equivalent.  The photo quality is tremendous - photos are tack sharp and I find it much easier to set up great photos than with the NEX.  Maybe this is because it is the \"entry level\" and has fewer options - the NEX has a touch screen but the menu system is still a bit of a maze.  I am happy with the lenses I have, as my experiment continues, but I have noted how much cheaper they are than the Sony equivalent. And the quality is as good or better.So, I'm hooked.  I know this is described everywhere as a entry level, beginner etc. etc. camera but the controls are easily accessible and it takes great photos.  I haven't used the guide mode but presume it is good if you are starting out.  What astonishes me, is that I have a DSLR that is lighter, and not much bigger, than a mirrorless system which is a joy to use.  Finally, it makes me think more about the photo I am trying to take rather than just looking at the screen, I am getting better photos as a result. There is no doubt that next time I am traveling it will be with the Nikon.Negatives.  Of course nothing is perfect.  I like to use bracketing and this option is not included. Once I turn on liveview, I find myself missing the NEX. Given the enjoyment I get from using it, I still grade it five starts.If, like me, you are busy wondering what DSLR to start off with, get this camera (and the 35mm or 50mm prime lens).  It is just tremendous fun (with gorgeous photos)!!", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera but check your needs.", "Author": "Santiago Pecha", "ReviewID": "R1BYDFMM9AOI7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing camera for beguinners.
