{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK, so it was only $20!", "Author": "Amber L. Benton \"Truth, Order, Beauty\"", "ReviewID": "R3S8MGPXVYII92", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had to keep this in mind as we first started to use this camera.  That's why I gave it a four out of 5 stars... after I got over my initial frustration/letdown it really isn't so bad.  I purchased this camera at Walmart for $20.  I bought it for my 5 year old because the kid proof camera we bought him (V-tech) took such horrid pictures and I want to see how long a real camera will survive with him before spending anymore money on one.  AND of course I want it to be able to take reasonably nice pictures - because I want him to be able to look at his pictures, decide which ones are good and which ones aren't and adjust his photography based on his results.  So based on those requirements it was worth the $20, but it's durability is still up in the air as he's only had it one day!Straight out of the package I found it frustrating and not intuitive to figure out.  I was ready to return it, honestly.  But I finally found the user guide and got the first pictures off it, and my husband reminded me how little we paid for it.  So I relented, gave it to the kid, he came back 5 minutes later with 30 pictures.  I downloaded them and a couple were pretty good.  I spent another 10 minutes trying to figure out how to delete the pictures and he took it back outside and came back in 10 minutes later with 30 pictures.  Now we have a rhythm.  He loves it.  He can tell it isn't a little kids camera and is actually treating it pretty well.  He took it with him to bed and I'm sure will be snapping more pictures at first light.The nitty gritty:#1  If you buy this camera, be careful opening the package.  There is a cd hidden inside the cardboard label - and they don't tell you it's there.  This cd has the software that downloads the pictures from the camera and it has the user guide on it.  I scratched ours when we opened it, but thankfully it still loaded.#2  As far as I can tell you can only download pictures from this camera using the ViviCam software.  This camera does not show up under the menu 'Your Computer' along with our drives and cd rom, etc. so the only way to access it is through this software.#3  Downloading the pictures does NOT erase them from the camera.  You must select the trashcan icon on the menu screen by pressing the shutter button.  It will erase all of the images on the camera.#4  Battery life actually seems ok so far.  There is a tiny screw that holds the battery door closed.  I love this because I gave it to my five year old!  If the batteries go dead before you remove pictures, you lose the pictures.  Likewise if you remove the batteries.#5  This camera holds 30 pictures at full resolution - just enough to last a five year old about 15 minutes.#6  This camera has no flash.  It actually does pretty well indoors, but those shots seem a little more blurry.  Shots outside have a very luminous sky.#7  Picture quality varies, but with some practice you can get good pictures.  Out of the 30 pictures my five year old typically has 3 that are decent which is not bad for a 5yo.  You have to have good camera control and a subject that isn't moving too much, but even some of those shots are interesting.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Mac compatible", "Author": "Robert Mitchell \"Dirt Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3PFDAM32IO178", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one each for triplet eight year old boys, thinking if they lost or destroyed them, I wouldn't be out much.  The packaging says Minimum System Requirements: ... Macintosh OS X v10.4.6 or later.  A downloaded manual indicates it only runs on PCs.  I have a number of camera drivers on my Mac with a later OS but none of them can connect.  So the packaging is not correct, but the manual is.  On another note, the camera has limited storage - at the highest resolution you can have about 12-15 images in the camera.  If you are thinking this may make a good first camera, you may have to spend a few more dollars.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Save Your Money & Apply It Toward Something Else", "Author": "Doggymcnuggets \"doggymcnuggets\"", "ReviewID": "R1WNWS8J7PLRYK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My 6 year old son wanted his own camera, and with Dad's advice not to spend too much of his money he bought this inexpensive camera at a local chain retailer. That'll teach him not to listen to Dad! He was super excited...until we opened the packaging and went to put the batteries in. The battery compartment door broke the very first time we opened it. This camera is incredibly flimsy, hence the cheap plastic latch that holds the battery door in place broke off immediately. That's actually the best thing that could have happened, as it necessitated us returning it without any time to question whether or not to keep it. For kicks we took some sample pictures with it by holding the battery compartment shut with one hand, and the pictures were just awful - all of them were blurry and the images are very low-res. I've had lower end cell phones with pretty mediocre cameras and they all put this thing to shame. This in no way qualifies as a real camera, so take my advice: save your twenty bucks and put it toward some other camera - any other camera but this one! Seriously, you can find decent budget priced cameras from quality makers (Canon, Kodak, etc) on sale for not much more than fifty dollars, so save up until you can afford one of those. The old saying goes \"you get what you pay for,\" but in this case you get even less.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "V15 Freelance review", "Author": "Arthur Martinson", "ReviewID": "R1DDA3JYNUWY14", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love my Linux PCs: the desktop and the laptop. I am not a gadget freak; I do not Skype; I do not tweet; I do not text; and I am suspicious of \"social media\". I needed the most inexpensive digital camera I could find. While I \"use\" Ubuntu Linux I am no system administrator, so any really difficult problems encountered would have resulted in a smashed camera.I took a few pics and attached the V15 to the USB port. The cam mounted and I could use the graphical file manager to verify the files in the cam. The fact that they were large ppm format was NOT encouraging. The files did, however, copy to my hard drive and I used \"Image Viewer\" and \"GIMP\" to convert them to jpeg. They display properly and are not really all that bad at the highest resolution setting on the cam.You will ONLY be able to take pics outside in lots of sunlight. The LCD display will tell you you do not have enough light if you try to take a pic. Hey, at least it tells you.It is easy to learn to use. I just wish the higher pixel cams had as few features and buttons. Maybe one day I will get an adult digital camera.Note to Penguins: Ubuntu GNOME 13.10 would NOT let me copy over the files; I had to use my LXDE desktop on the same machine before they would copy.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "my review", "Author": "David S.
