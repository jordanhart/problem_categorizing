I had a heck of a time to find out who makes this device and where to get service if needed is a bigger issue.  When I finally got a user manual there is no reference to where to send to get repaired.  The remote will not talk to the DVR unit and could be defective (batteries are good) so I am stuck with the initial settings. I get 16 pictures and some in B&W; from Color being displayed from color cameras and that is an issue an other issue?  Sure would have been nice to have an acronym list also.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good DVR", "Author": "Charlie Collins", "ReviewID": "R2O5GVAEJRO0BF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My security system DVR at work died and I researched for another one.  I liked this one because:1) It comes with a Hard Drive2) It has BNC connections3) It has the option for audio for all cameras4) One surprising feature is that it can beep at you if there's motion detected based on which camera you select.5) The web user interface is pretty good.6) It can handle 16 cameras.Cons:1) You can't customize the display - placing camera shots on the screen where you want them.2) Using the remote isn't very intuitive.3) The software isn't as intuitive as my last DVR.5) There isn't a quick way to go through recorded videos like my last DVR. You have to manually click the ones that you want to watch.6) It makes a clicking sound when it detects motion on any of the cameras.  So, at my business, it's clicking quite a bit.  Not too annoying and I might like it more when I'm here at night, but I could do without it.Overall, I've seen DVR systems for a lot more money that do basically the same thing.  It is thin and doesn't take up a ton of room.  It arrived fast in the mail.  Overall, I'd buy it again.  If you only need to review recordings every once in a while, this might work for you.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad Product!  Only Lasted 4 months :(", "Author": "Hawaii SuperTech", "ReviewID": "RHVX50CNINVKE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this product back in August 2011.  I had a hard time setting up this DVR as the instructions are not clear.  I called the seller and got this Asian guy on the phone.  I asked him for instructions as he was very rude on the phone.  He was not much of a help at all.  I had to figure everything myself.  Also, this system is not compatible for Windows 7.After 4  months, (December 2011); these system keep shutting on & off, remote control not working, buttons also not working on the interface, can't access remote viewing and can't playback.These system is waste of money due to non operable after 4 months.  I would rather buy at costco or sam's club because at least they would cover a 1 year warranty.  My $500 went down the drain.  These seller don't offer any warranty at all.  Please save your hard earn money and avoid these DVR.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much better than Q-See QSD2316L", "Author": "Kris H.", "ReviewID": "R3RZLTK8XIXTPY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this DVR to replace a troubled QSee QSD2316L.  This new DVR is much nicer, has a better user interface, and the video playback is so much better!Strengths:Video playback fast-forward/rewind works more like a home satellite/cable DVR, and can smoothly go forward/reverse at 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32x speeds.Three entirely isolated video outputs: VGA, TV and spot TV.The included remote control is perfectly minimalistic.The price is outstanding.Weaknesses:The TV output doesn't appear to be customizable (it always displays all 16 channels).The web interface doesn't work with IE9.  We are geeks here, so we get around it easily by using Windows XP in a VirtualBox virtual machine.Choosing the VGA layout you want is tedious with the mouse (however, it works well with the included remote control).It appears that the recorded video quality might be a little lower than with the QSee, but I haven't placed the videos side-by-side to compare them.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,499.95", "Features": "16 CH Video Input H.264 triplex real time economical stand alone DVR\nGraphical interface, easy to use\nNetwork file share function, support composite video, VGA and HDMI output\nBackup file supports windows media player\nIncluded: Digital Video Recorder,Remote Control, Power Supply, User Manual and Software CD, USB Mouse, Audio Connection Pigtail, 2TB Hard Drive", "Name": "VideoSecu 16 Channel DVR Stand Alone H.264 Triplex Real Time Remote Review Digital Video Recorder with 2000GB (2TB) SATA Hard Drive Security Camera DVR 1YV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tLj7lLFJL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001IB6OLY"}}
