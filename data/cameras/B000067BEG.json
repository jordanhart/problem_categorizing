I'm not sure what it is about photography that gets my motor going, but I just love every aspect of it. And, yet, I'm not in the camp that believes that I must have the latest and greatest of everything in order to be a good photographer. In the end, the equipment is of little matter: it's just the light, the subject, the film media and you.It took me a while to get on the digital bandwagon. Initially, I went halfway and purchased a film scanner to get my 35mm negatives into digital form. While this is great for existing photos or for situations where you absolutely need to shoot on film for some reason, it slows down the workflow considerably. First, the film needs to be developed. Then you need to scan each negative individually on the computer. It can take as long as an hour to scan a full roll of 36 images. And, just like working in the darkroom, any dust specs are made larger than life in the final image, which requires some time messing with PhotoShop. This is not ideal for high-capacity work.After about six months of research, I finally decided on the Fuji FinePix S602. Fuji has a reputation for selling excellent digital cameras that produce remarkable pictures, and the S602 is no exception. I compared this to several of the Canon and Olympus prosumer models as well as several other Fuji cameras.I was looking for a camera that would allow me to have complete manual control over exposure and aperture as well as automating everything for me for when I was feeling lazy. In addition, I wanted it to be able to produce images that could be faithfully printed to sizes up to 8 x 10, though most of my digital work would be for the web. Since I have a full lighting set up, I also wanted a hotshoe so that I could take advantage of external lighting.Initially, I leaned toward the Fuji FinePix 2800, which has a 2.1 MegaPixel CCD and runs at almost half the price of the S602. After some soul-searching, I decided that 2.1 MP wasn't near enough for what I wanted. In addition, the 2800 is uncomfortably small for my hand, while the S602 feels like it was designed specifically with my big ol' hands in mind.The S602 is rather bulky compared to a lot of the cameras out there (except maybe for the Minolta Dimage). I'm not entirely sure what the obsession with smaller cameras is all about. I don't want a camera that I can accidentally inhale. The S602 is about 3/4 the size of my Canon Rebel G, which I feel is a perfect size. It's fairly light and has all of the controls in an easily accessible location. At first, all of the buttons and options for this thing may seem mind-boggling. After just a little practice, though, I found the user interface to be absolutely intuitive and easy to handle.Another feature I looked for was the ability to quickly capture images one after another. I had played with too many digital cameras that required several seconds between shots, which is frustrating when you're trying to work fast. The S602 has several rapid-fire modes, but I have found its standard shot-to-shot speed to be more than sufficient for most of my needs. I don't ever feel like I'm waiting to press the shutter.Perhaps the one thing that pushed me the strongest in the direction of purchasing this model was the fact that it takes both Compact Flash and SmartMedia memory cards. In fact, you can use both cards at the same time, switching to one when the other has filled up. It would have been nice if Fuji had made this easier - you can only switch cards from the \"setup\" mode of the camera rather than through one of their shifted shortcuts - but it's not a major inconvenience.Fuji has touted the fact that this camera can produce an effective 6.1 megapixels. Keep in mind, though, that the CCD is only capable of 3.1 megapixels, so anything above that is interpolated, which means the software analyzes the picture and inserts its best guess of what pixels would best pad the image to boost it to higher numbers. The 6.1 MP images are fairly nice and probably a bit better than I could get out of PhotoShop, but they are not as pin-sharp as they would be from a true 6.1 MP CCD. Bottom line: if you're considering buying this camera thinking it's a 6.1 MegaPixel camera, save your money for a true 6 MP camera.While I'm mostly satisfied with this purchase, there does seem to be one major flaw with this camera. I like being able to manually focus on my subjects. I'm not sure why I distrust autofocus so much, but I'm not a big fan of using it exclusively. Both the Electronic View Finder and the screen on the back allow you to zoom into one area so that you can manually adjust the focus to a specific subject, but it seems that, no matter how hard I try, I just can't get it pin-sharp. Even when it looks good in the view finder, it looks blurry once I have uploaded the image to the computer. The autofocus does a pretty good job of fixing this for me, but I'd like to be able to do this manually without hassle. It may just require more practice on my part.All in all, I'm thrilled with this camera. It does everything I could hope for and more, provides a seemingly endless number of functions to help boost the creativity of my photography and produces absolutely beautiful images that are of an extremely high quality. I would heartily recommend this camera to anyone looking for a fairly inexpensive equivalent to their 35mm SLR.", "Date": "December 4, 2002"}, {"Title": "Fuji S602Z Review", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RS9JOQDKXAHF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking into upgrading to a newer digital camera.  Previously owned a Kodak DC 290.  Although this camera still takes great photo's and I still use the camera on occasion, the need for a camera that would have the feel of a 35MM SLR and have the capability to capture image's of moving objects was desired.  After reading many camera reviews it was decided that the Fuji S602Z was what I would be looking for.  Some of the nice features that have been included in this camera is the zoom lens.  The camera was received the day before I would be attending Hydro-plane races.  Browsing over the owners manual it was time to put the media card and batteries in the camera and put it through it's paces.  Fuji did a very good job at placing the zoom and setup features in a place on the camera that is easily adjusted.  Battery life is very good.  I did use rechargeable batteries, recorded 300 images with the rechargeable batteries used.  Extremely pleased with the image quality.  Would recommend taking a good look at the camera if you are looking for a reasonable priced camera that takes great image's and has the potential for much more after you become accustomed with the use of the camera.  The 3.1 Megapixel is a little behind other camera's but most will never notice the difference.  This Camera also has 2,832x2,128 (6.0 million) Recorded pixels.  Plus Dual slots, SmartMedia and Compact flash.  Super CCD and the use of 4 AA batteries (not a expensive dedicated battery pack) made this choice easier also.  The Hot Shoe for a stronger flash unit is appreciated also. (Also not a need to buy a dedicated unit).", "Date": "July 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "D.

I exchanged an Olympus D-550 specifically for a camera with a better optical zoom (6x vs. 2.8x).  The grip is very comfortable to hold, however, someone with small hands may find it a little difficult to push some of the intended buttons.  The camera looks very slick and feels extremely sturdy.  The menus and functions are very easy to use.  It took no time at all to start taking pictures after taking it out of the box.  There are a lot of extra features which I havn't used yet but the pictures I've taken are indeed spectacular.  There are various resolutions the camera can be set to within the 6mp, 3mp & 1mp mode, but a 2mp setting doesn't exist.  I have found the battery life to be quite impressive.  I am still using the original alkaline batteries even after taking approx 50 pictures,  using the camera to download to my PC, recording video and viewing them on my TV.  However, the battery life indicator has yet to come on so I don't know how much juice is really left.  The Fuji's colors are very vibrant and true.  This is an all around excellent camera that takes wonderful pictures, both indoors and out and with both automatic or manual settings.  The camera is a little larger than most but that's because of the powerful optical zoom.  I recommend the 602z to anyone who wants a little more than just an automatic point and shoot digital camera, although this one will function that way if you want.", "Date": "August 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "Better Than My 35mm SLR", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2I3HZ89SZ5I5R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an avid amateur photographer since childhood, I was reluctant to trade in my superb Olympus 35mm zoom-lens-reflex to go digital. I purchased the Fuji S602 Zoom on a salesperson's recommendation, and couldn't be more thrilled. The convenience, flexibility, and creative potential in digital photography as compared to film photography are self-evident, but what blows my mind is the unbelievably high quality of these images - they are actually better than the photos I got with my old Olympus. Amazingly sharp and clear with gorgeous, realistic color (or black-and-white, if you prefer) - which you can, of course, tweak in editing and printing. The camera, lightweight and well-designed, can be used completely automatically, completely manually, or anywhere in between (aperture priority, shutter priority, various flash modes, night modes, portrait mode, etc., etc.). The lens opens to f2.8 and has a 35mm-equivalent zoom length of 35mm - 210mm - well, all the specs are available on Fuji's website, so you can see for yourself; suffice it to say that if you're hesitating about making the switch from film to digital because you're afraid of sacrificing quality, you needn't worry with this superb, superb piece of equipment.", "Date": "July 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "The Fuji S602 - A Great Digital Camera with Fantastic Images", "Author": "S.

I have made several test prints from it and have been highly impressed:  excellent color clarity, sharpness, and the camera is a joy to use.First things first:  I have to applaud Amazon[.com] for advertising this camera as a 3.3mp.  Buyer beware--although you might see Fuji and/or other stores advertise this as being a 6mp camera, this is after the interpolation process that Fuji cameras use.  The sensor in this camera is 3mp, and through a special process the camera goes through, you end up with a 6mp image.  It looks good, but not as good as a picture from a *true* 6mp camera.  Go to Fuji's website to read more about the process.  Regardless of that, this camera is fully capable of making beautiful prints sized 8x10 and even larger.The camera is made really well.  The body is lightweight and feels \"right\" in your hands.  I was kind of shocked to see the use of AA batteries.  Normally they last no longer than an hour or so in digital cameras.  Somehow Fuji has managed to fix all that.  I use this camera all the time, and the batteries last several hours.  The screen as well as the electronic viewfinder are very clear and easy on the eyes.Typically the movie mode that digital cameras have are pretty poor quality.  The Fuji's movie mode features a 30fps rate and fairly good sound quality.  The best I've seen in a digital camera.Other features on this camera that really stand out are the implementation of a 6x OPTICAL zoom, a manual focus ring (really useful at times), manual modes, and a hot shoe for a flash.  Unfortunately the hot-shoe flash is not TTL and will require you to do manual settings, but at least it's there.A good effort from Fuji--highly recommended.", "Date": "November 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "Neophytes only", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"etollis\"", "ReviewID": "R23IP2EZ0070DJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay folks.

Heck, the lowest shutter speed was 1 second. So.. the next five months I researched loads of cameras. And I finally narrowed it down to a few choices: Minolta 7i, Coolpix 4500, Canon G3, Olympus C-730 .. and the Fuji.I chose the Fuji.. and here's why:In simple, the Fuji offered the most of what I want. It has all my manual controls, it has nice focusing controls, it has adequate megapixel count, firm body, compact flash support, nice grip, decent software, good zoom, dual-media drives, superior movie mode ..The only downfalls to this camera: It's only 3.1 Megapixel, no matter what anyone tells you. But, for me, that was enough. I never print ANYTHING larger than 8 x 10, and if I ever plan to, I can use the interpolated 6 MP mode. AND no auto-focusing assiting lamp. But the manual controls this camera offers more than make up for it.Do yourself a favor and buy the Fuji. Don't be fooled by what you think you need. Longer zoom isn't that big of a deal. 6x is plenty, any farther and you get camera shake. Megapixel count is excellent for just 3. It's certainly enough for the average consumer.

I tend to get more good pictures now because I can immediately view my shots and tell if I've got something wrong.

Besides, delayed gratification is not my strong suit.)The Fujifilm site gives a detailed description of their CCD (Charge Coupled Device) pixel array that to me sounds like the best thing going in what the working class like me can afford.  The S602 is Fuji's 3rd generation CCD, the S5000 is their 4th generation.  The 602 has 6x optical and 4.4x digital zoom (26.4x), the 5000 has 10x optical and 2.2x digital (22x).  If that extra 4.4 turns your head, then shopping for a telephoto is probably something to consider.  I find the greater lens power more attractive, and should give clearer photos, side by side with the 602 at a comparable focal length setting.If you want to spend serious $$$ for something that has 5 to 8 megapixels, more power to you.  But the S5000 is a better Fuji for less money ... the S602 is really last year's news.  My hard earned greenbacks are on the S5000.", "Date": "December 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great for New Parents!", "Author": "Snarfelpig \"nerd wannabe\"", "ReviewID": "R22TLUCGGA1XIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for almost 2 years now & I still think it's the best all around camera for new parents. Here's why:1. The video is AWESOME for a digicam. 640x480 resolution + 30 frames per second = 15 minutes of good quality candid shots on an IBM 1GB Microdrive. (note - nobody wants to watch 15 minutes of video, so the 3 minutes available on many of today's cameras is sufficient)2. Can easily be used as a point and shoot, but I like knowing the other features are available if I want to \"grow\" as a photographer.3. A connection (shoe) for additional flash gives me a little more range for those family shots.4. 3+ megapixels (if you get into that whole interpolated hexagon pixel confusion) gets me great photos - poster sized through online retailers like Kodak (don't ask me why, I just know it works), 8x10 at home on an inexpensive Canon inkjet, and with 4x6 I have a little wiggle room for cropping.I just purchased a Canon Powershot A95 with rotating LCD for my wife and it's great too, but we're still using the Fuji for combo video/picture sessions.I spent about $1000.00 on this, 2 128MB smart media cards, a case, and a 1GB IBM Microdrive in 11/2002.

I have taken almost 6,000 pictures in less than a month- it's one of the best! But I have a couple complaints.First, is that it's too slow for it's \"class\". With a camera this size and with so many features, you would expect faster action than with the pocket-size compact cams. Not so. OK, I will give you that's it a good speed, but if you are trying to take quick snap-shots, it's going to be difficult. Maybe I am asking for too much in $600 but it's gotten t be annoying. The focus ring doesn't do much good because the sensitivity is too slow/low.Secondly, the playback is rather slow for today's cameras. I have an old Canon PowerShot 300/IXUS 300, and it reviewed pictures pretty well, and it's two and a half years old! This isn't a big thing for pro's, but since this is for the crowd that probably likes to take pictures of people and show them back as well, it's annoying having to take 10 seconds of looking at a black screen. Also if you try to switch the camera on and then off quick forget it.Thirdly, the camera has no way of naming each picture in serial fashion, at least if you are using Compact Flash. It's a small detail that has caused me to go through all 6000 pictures and renamed them manually using the Windows 'rename' function. Sure, I think there are programs for this, but I like to keep my stuff out of programs, beause software always changes, and it's just not worth my time.OK, small minor infractions in the whole long run but now I am looking at a Cannon or the new Sony DSC-F828 that's comming out soon. If you like to take pictures for fun, and want more control and flexibility, then this is a great camera.

But for the 4 months that i owned the s602, i was very impressed with many of the features that had been an improvement from many of the previous models.  This camera is BY FAR the BEST ergonomically shaped with excellent added attention to button orientation and placement.  The zoom in/out buttons are placed in the position that are easily accessed by the thumb which means you can zoom without taking your eye off the subject, limiting time spent searching for buttons.  In addition, they're also tilted at a slight diagonal angle to insure that it meets the normal relaxed position of the operator's thumb.  The on/off switch is rotational which means the operator won't accidentally turn off the camera.  The camera body itself is very compact and very light.  It adopts the make-up of many high-end digital slr's.Other features that impressed me besides the exterior were the \"honey-comb\" ccd image censor (super ccd) and the lcd screen.  The super ccd image sensor allows the effective megapixel count to double this means an image taken at 3.3 mp may be optionally captured at a very high resolution of 6mp.  One thing that separated this camera from other more expensive cameras was the LCD screen.  The battery efficient lcd screen allows a user to take 400-500 shots before needing to change batteries.  There's even a light that tells you when the batteries are low (green for good, orange for low batteries).  The lcd screen resonates more crisp images with far less \"dead pixel\" count than better than Sony's F717 \"L-shaped camera\" as well as Canon's G5, G4, G3...  I've also realized that the s602's lcd screen has a stain resistant + protective plastic plate that makes the lcd screen a lot more durable on trips.  If you don't trust me, please test it out for yourself at any electronics store.  You'll see an instant choppy graininess in the image quality from the aforementioned models that you won't see from the s602.  Moreover, unlike most cameras offered in the market, the s602 features multiple media outlets.  There are 2 media drives and the cool thing about them is that you can use two at the same time; you just need to toggle between them in the menu.  This allows you to have more choices in what type of media to use and it also allows for a backup card if the one currently in use is full.  For example, if your 64mb smartmedia drive is full, you can go to the menu and change to the microdrive that supports up to 1gb of storage!!!  Besides the media storage i was also impressed by the electronic viewfinder.  It's a lot more accurate than most optical viewfinders (that is, in reference to digital cameras).  And it's also a great alternative to the lcd screen and battery efficiency.  This camera has a lot of manual control and the pictures come out very nice.  There's a built-in flash, but it also supports an external flash with the hotshoe that's placed over the built-in flash.  The zoom on the camera has a macro option for close up pictures, which compliments its 6x capability.  This camera also provides streamline 30fps movie mode which has no time limit.  The 30 fps is equivalent to a camcorder (but the audio is horrible and sounds like it came from a paper-cup).  This far outweights canon's g4 camera with a limited 3x zoom and 3minute limitation on 20 fps.With all the positive things going for the camera i could only find 2 negatives.  One was the fact that besides, excellent macro zoom, the camera had only 1 lousy focusing point.  That was a major reason for selling the camera.  It's difficult to get multiple subjects from different field depths to be in focus, especially when i was trying to take a macro close-up of a lizard in my backyard.  Even Sony's f717 has 5 focusing points.  My other big complaint is that the camera has a VERY noisy zoom/focusing drive train.  I don't understand why fuji decided to have such an loud drive train mechanism controlling the lens.  Sony's f717 is super quiet, you can't even hear the it zoom or focus in the act.  This kind of goes along with my other qualm with the cheap construction of the camera.  The buttons are made of cheap plastic and pretty flimsy.  I hope i've provided some info that other users of this camera haven't.

I always thought after near four years of trailing behind the technology, that things had not changed much. I was very wrong. The changes are completely beyond my expectations.IMPORTANT:I have modified this review in light of investigations leading me to find out I was wrong about the hardness setting concerns.What I thought was smearing due hard/soft image setting is due to the ISO setting! WHEN USING ISO 400, FINE DETAIL IS SMEARED giving the picture an odd, fudgy, appearance. Once I set the camera to ISO 160 for outdoor work, all is fine.MINOR niggles:Battery cuts out with VERY little warning (like a few seconds!).Not good AUTO focussing in dim conditions.Tricky to use manual focussing (don't know if there is another camera with an electronic viewfinder which offers better, but...). The camera uses a small blown up area in the centre of the screen to focus on, but its not too easy (neat feature though)Can be a little tricky to navigate round all the features (but I'm getting used to it).Would've been nice to see more lower res options; eg 1024x786, and why have a 'basic' 450k version of the 2000x3000 image????Slight, but noticeable unfocussing at image edges (left and right) on hi res shots.NOT a pocket camera.SUMMARY OF GOOD POINTS:Big and high quality lens giving nice, and colourful images and the flash is not need for most pics which is great!FANTASTIC features from full auto control to completely manual with light metering; I'm still learning about them after three weeks of constant use!Virtually everything is customisable.Very good range of shutter speeds opening up great possibilities (including flash synced pics down to 1/10000 sec!)Preview mode (click once you are happy with a shot to store)Dual/triple media format; CF (upto 512mb - not the 128 in the manual), SM and IBM Microdrive.Display grid making accurate horizons a breeze.Three shot mode; one over exposed, one 'normal' exposure, and one under exposed.Multi expose pictures as many times as you wish, building layer upon layer of imaging.VERY GOOD battery life. Much better than my old camera; well over 100 pics using the flash intermittently and also the screen all the time! Use NIMH batteries though.6x Zoom -very useful; more than I would have thought.640 X 480 Full vga movie mode with sound.ISO 1600 option for low light no flash pics (a bit grainy for usual pics, though)NOT a pocket camera (looks the part).So many other good things and more which I have not discovered yet!It can be used as a point and click snapper, or it has all the manual features one could hope for for really creative shooting.The fact that you have COMPLETE manual control from 15 secs shutter down to 1/10000 AND aperture settings from F2.8 - F11. This completely manual option is coupled with a very handy light meter which means that the manual mode is really easy to use. In fact I use it for most scenery pics.I bought this camera for work (machinery pics) and mainly for its big lens for capturing good pics without flash in lowish light.It has delivered a heck of a lot more; I now look at the old Olympus C2000Z and at this side by side. I paid the same price for the Oly four years ago and thought cameras had not moved on since; I was wrong!Having said all this I am aware that other cameras now may offer even more to the consumer; I think this camera offers a little more to the creative user - If you think you will never use the major creative features of this camera and picture size and quality are absolute criteria, look elsewhere as you'll find cameras which will offer a smidgen better picture quality or higher resolution, but for a blend of excellent picture quality, all the features you could want, and value for money (price for this unit is very keen now), then look no further.", "Date": "March 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!!", "Author": "\"tommy55347\"", "ReviewID": "RRUA0NLF7I2KR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a dream machine!

Almost DSLR experience except it's a 3.3mp sensor.  Shutter lag was somewhat noticeable - I had to work around it to get great sports photos.Ability in low light was limited.  The Fujinon lens is a nice, fast piece of glass but the limit was always noise at anything above ISO 400.If you can pick one of these up used for about $50-75 on Craigslist (October 2010) then you have a very interesting camera for low $$$'s.I think I paid nearly $600 for it back when it was new.

I'm not a professional by any means, but I have already found vast improvement in the quality of my photos by using this. It's a real gem from yesteryear.

People who love tweaking options can get a nice range of settings for ISO and aperture, but it doesn't throw so much at you that it gets overwhelming. As a relative newbie I rarely venture far from the auto mode but sometimes I try out the various priority settings or do some manual focus. No matter what my shots always look great.Near as I can tell the optics are pretty good. You get a range that goes anywhere from 6x zoom (use a tripod!) to the Super Macro - a really awesome feature that practically lets you put the lens right up against an object and shoot. There's a flash hotshoe for external attachment (the on-camera flash is pretty standard fare). I especially love the electronic viewfinder, since I never quite got the hang of looking at the LCD screens on digital cameras. This one is bright and sharp and frames your shot well. You can do a Voice Memo and record yourself so you'll know just what the heck you were photographing at the time. And it takes VGA/QVGA video to boot!A couple of quick gripes: there is no battery indicator except for \"battery is dying in three seconds, powering off\" (and there is a design flaw that causes one battery to drain when left in the camera... Google for a fix) Only supports up to 2gb CF cards and archaic 128mb SmartMedia cards. ISO 800/1600 limits resolution to 1.2 megapixels.

This far outweights canon's g4 camera with a limited 3x zoom and 3minute limitation on 20 fps.With all the positive things going for the camera i could only find 2 negatives.  One was the fact that besides, excellent macro zoom, the camera had only 1 lousy focusing point.  That was a major reason for selling the camera.  It's difficult to get multiple subjects from different field depths to be in focus, especially when i was trying to take a macro close-up of a lizard in my backyard.  Even Sony's f717 has 5 focusing points.  My other big complaint is that the camera has a VERY noisy zoom/focusing drive train.  I don't understand why fuji decided to have such an loud drive train mechanism controlling the lens.  Sony's f717 is super quiet, you can't even hear the it zoom or focus in the act.  This kind of goes along with my other qualm with the cheap construction of the camera.  The buttons are made of cheap plastic and pretty flimsy.  I hope i've provided some info that other users of this camera haven't.  If you're suspicious of my review of this camera in anyway, please go to your local Fry's or Best Buy and try it out yourself.", "Date": "August 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "The best camera i evere had", "Author": "yaari ran", "ReviewID": "R1BZ7WS3YV17GL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my Camera in Insbruck Austria' 2 months after it came to the market.I could get it in the U S A for lees mony, but i culd not wait any more, as i was in a tour in Tirol-Austria.I have allso an 3 years old Fiji 4700 finefix, that i like very much.

Vongrabe \"vongrabe\"", "ReviewID": "R2FVHYRI59T85Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The truth is this camera is unfit for the purpose intended. To begin with , while the built-in screen freezes the picture at the time of taking it, the actual picture is recorded approx. 1 second later. No problem when you work in a studio with models, for sport or any animated subject it leaves composition to chance. Highly annoying.Next, the camera controls are maximum user-unfriendly. After 3 months of operation, I was unable to figure out how to adjust exposure (or at least turn auto-exposure off). For example, when you use the camera for document scanning (for example to speed up document conversion into digital files) with lots of white paper and 20% text, it adjusts the image too dark. While the usual text scanner software (I use Caere), works with it notwithstanding, the image shows a medium to dark brown background. That is the case even when you set it on manual.This does not happen in normal operation, though: in fact, color, exposure (even under difficult lighting conditions) and resolution is excellent in real life situations; they are nearly perfect. If the image would be recorded at the time the button is pushed the camera would be ok.Next, the camera does not have a remote control. While for regular photography it may seem unimportant, in a repro-stand, or for that matter in studio photography, a remote would come in handy.Finally, the mechanical design is Mickey Mouse. After inserting approx. 5 times over three months the 1394 cable into the camera-based connector, the connector disappeared somewhere inside the camera and can no longer be found, a gaping hole is there instead. I did not even use one of the heavily shielded 1394 cables. When it was working before the connector disappeared, though, the camera provided excellent moving picture results for Internet (cable) communications.It is a pitty that an excellent concept was executed so poorly.", "Date": "December 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "Wish I could rate it", "Author": "Daniel Fortmann", "ReviewID": "R10O22WV6XQLZM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After paying extra for next day delivery, I was hoping my order would arrive prior to my trip 5 days later.
