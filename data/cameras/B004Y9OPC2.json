during daylight. I was also impressed with its performance at night. The Infrared LEDs did an excellent job of illumination  and actually were almost too bright for the center of the image... but the majority of the rest of the image area was illuminated very well thanks to the 36 infrared LEDs surrounding the lens of this camera.The camera is housed in an aluminum enclosure that is rated IP66. This rating is about as good as it gets and means that the enclosure is dust-proof and will be able to withstand a strong, direct stream of water. In other words, this camera should be able to withstand outdoor conditions without any issues. The body is roughly the size of a 12oz can of soda. There is a hood/shield over the camera body that extends out and over the front of the camera and allows for about an inch or so of fore and aft adjustment.Out of the rear of the camera is a 2 foot long cord bundle that contains an ethernet port. Two additional wires at the end of the cord provide a power port and a reset button for the camera. The ethernet is used for initial setup of the camera and can also be used to circumvent the wireless capabilities of the camera if you want to use the camera as a wired ethernet camera instead. Power to the camera is provided by an AC adapter rated 100-240v and 50/60Hz.Because of the relatively short cord of the AC adapter wire, you would need to tap into AC power from a wall switch or fixture in close proximity to where the camera needs to be installed otherwise you would need to use extension cords which is not desirable.The mounting hardware included with the camera is lightweight duty and you might want to upgrade the mounting hardware depending on your installation needs.There is no audio capability in this particular model of camera. My video clearly demonstrates the quality of the image from the camera in day and night conditions.So for the price, this camera provides a lot of value.Setup is another matter. I have a pet peeve against poor documentation. How difficult can it be  for a company to spend a few thousand dollars to have a qualified technical copywriter produce adequate documentation? The quickstart guide included with this camera is so poorly translated and written that it makes setup of this camera way more difficult than it needs to be. In fact, once I worked my way through the setup through trial and error, I realized that it's not really difficult at all, It's just that the poor documentation makes it confusing and seemingly difficult. Maybe a user with more experience with security cameras and router setup would not have experienced the problems I did, but my point is that the \"average\" user will more than likely run into the same difficulties that I did.Basically, if you want to use the camera strictly on your LAN... that is if you have the camera mounted outside your house and just want to be able to view the image from a computer in your house, it's relatively easy to setup. If you also want to be able to view the image from the WAN... that is from any computer on the Internet, that requires altering settings in your router which will be confusing to many people because of the poor documentation. The reality is that is also is not that difficult to do.Regarding the software that is provided with the camera... it provides basic functionality but some people may choose to use other third-party software. That's entirely up to the user.I used both a PC running Windows 8 and a Mac running Mountain Lion to setup the camera. Some of the software provided is only compatible on a PC but a PC is not required to setup the camera. The software for PC is optimized for Internet Explorer. Using any other browser will not provide complete control of the camera and no browser on the Mac will allow complete control of the camera.I am not that familiar with wireless security cameras nor the setup of same. I am also not an expert at network setup but am not a complete idiot either. I'm somewhat technically inclined, just not well-versed in the intricacies of  port-forwarding and more advanced router setup procedures. Having said that, I found the procedure for getting this camera working over the WAN to be daunting. It took no less than 2 hours of putzing around before I finally \"got it\" largely due to the poorly written quickstart guide and marginally better documentation available on the Lofetk website.The Loftek Nexus 543 security camera is great, particularly when taking price into consideration. It's the hardware that deserves the bulk of the rating since the software can be replaced by third party software and the poor documentation can be worked around as well. So for the price the camera performs well and seems pretty well built.Since I have not had the camera very long at the time I am writing this review, I can't speak as to the long-term performance. I will update my review if necessary.I look forward to the possibility of reviewing other models of security cameras by Loftek.UPDATE: 4/12/2013: Regarding the mysterious powder that I mention in my review... I alerted the company that supplied me with the camera to that and offered to send them back the camera for further investigation. They had nothing to say except they didn't know what it was either. But apparently they didn't want to see the camera either so.......I was provided a sample for review.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, retarded software, mounting bracket from hell, connectors NOT weatherproof", "Author": "J. Martin", "ReviewID": "R1U2UKKGJ1DG60", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am giving this camera five stars because its performance is by far the best of the three relatively low-price surveillance cameras I've tried recently. It has a few peripheral flaws that I cannot bring myself to deduct stars for because they are fairly easily resolved.PROS:The image is probably as good as it gets for a cheapish VGA-resolution camera (640 x 480 pixels). The infrared optics and electronics required for nighttime imaging do not seem to detract at all from the color fidelity of the daylight image, which is excellent. Unlike an even cheaper IR camera I tried, greens are not gray, grays are not green, and blacks are not red. All colors are as they should be.The monochrome nighttime image quality is also the best I've found so far, much clearer and MUCH better detail than on the cheaper IR camera, even though its resolution was supposedly the same.The 36 IR LEDs give bright, even illumination over the entire viewing area and up to at least 30 feet (which is as far as I care about), with no noticeable concentration of light in the center as the 11 LEDS on the cheaper camera did.After initial setup with an Ethernet cable to the router (which is mandatory), I have used wireless connection exclusively with flawless results, in several different locations up to 80 feet from the router, inside and outside, with several interior and exterior walls and now even a massive triple-flue brick chimney in between.The case of the camera is very impressively hefty and rugged. I don't doubt that it is as weatherproof as the manufacturer claims. The IP66 rating is indeed impressive. It means that NO solid particles can enter the camera body. Period. There is no dust fine enough to get through the seals. It also means that no jet of water at any pressure from any direction can enter the camera enclosure. It might be susceptible to liquids only if completely submerged.Which leads me to the flaws:CONSAlthough the camera enclosure is impressively weatherproof, the electrical interface is not weatherproof at all, and it is permanently fixed to the camera through a singly hefty cable about a foot long. That cable ends in a receptacle for the Ethernet cable, which has two thinner cables about five inches long branching out the back, one to a connector for the power supply and the other to a small push-button reset switch. So any installation that takes advantage of the camera's ruggedness is going to have to provide separate and equal protection for those very vulnerable electronic connections, UNLESS you can bring the cable directly indoors within a foot of the camera. I can't do that, so I'm having to rig up another enclosure for them that will be mounted next to the camera. A little better attention to the design of the electronic interface would have made the camera's IP66 rating more easily exploited.The mounting bracket is one of the worst I have ever had the misfortune to wrestle with. I'm too angry at it right now to say much more, except that getting it adjusted and stable is a nightmare.The included software - as other reviewers have noted - is lame, as is most of the documentation (which completely ignores the mounting issues I just described). Clearly the manufacturer invested all its development budget in the camera itself, which at least was a wise choice. The camera really is so good that I still refuse to deduct even one star for these deficiencies.COMMENTSAfter a couple of hours' research, I followed another reviewer's lead and got Blue Iris software to control the camera. It is fantastic, and it's well worth the cost of $30 (support for one camera only) or $50 (up to 64 cameras). It makes setting up flawless motion detection, viewing video clips, zooming, panning (only in SW with this camera, but also in hardware with appropriate cameras), etc., a breeze. It has built-in support for this camera, and the only thing I haven't been able to do yet with it is adjust brightness and contrast, for which I had to use the included IPCamera Soft software. I did not have Blue Iris yet when I set up the camera's network interface through the Ethernet cable, so you may have to use the included software bundle to do that too. But that part is well enough documented and easy enough that it's okay.Finally: the color. Maybe color names have different meanings in China, but I never in a million years would have described this camera as \"silver gray.\" It is a lovely lilac color, a definite, unmistakeable LILAC, without any hint of gray, although it IS a sort of silvery lilac. It is a beautiful color, but macho types will not be showing it off to their beer buddies.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "decent camera, needs firmware update for mac compatibility", "Author": "The Rocketdyke. \"rocketdyke\"", "ReviewID": "R3CMGXL20849L7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When first trying to access this camera, I was presented with a 320x240 image and no buttons in the interface. \"strange,\" I thought, \"shouldn't I have some kind of control over the camera features that other people talk about?\"So instead of safari, I launched chrome. Same thing. Then firefox. Same thing. I cracked out User Agent Switcher in firefox and set it to be IE in windows 7. Presto! I had an interface, although most of the buttons were broken. Turns out they were doing some silly javascript OS sniffing, and dropping everyone in to the mobile device browser if they couldn't figure out what browser you were using.Thinking something was amiss, I contacted the seller. They suggested I download internet explorer for the mac. IE for mac? that hasn't been published since 2003 and won't run on an intel machine. Laughable. When I pointed this out to them, they asked me to contact them off amazon, as it stripped attachments, and they would send me a new firmware.So after a bit of email juggling, I get a new firmware file. Unfortunately, there is no way to upload it from a mac, so I booted up in my very old winXP that I keep handy and tried to install the \"firmware\" file they gave me. No good. Same problem when I rebooted into macOS. back to windows, and this time, I uploaded it in the \"  Upgrade Device Embeded Web UI \" box. This actually worked when I rebooted back to snow leopard. I now have full control over almost all of the camera features, but I cannot display a timestamp on the image, that appears to be a windows only setting.So, make sure you can get web UI version 0.0.4.18 from the vendor if you want to see this from a mac OS based browser. Also,  be prepared to use a dual-boot system to load the proper web ui firmware.Decent camera, decent images, I'll let people know if the weatherproofing doesn't hold up.but good luck if you only have a mac and can't dual-boot into windows.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera/ Bad software", "Author": "Matt Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3MYDRIMIZ6IYK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Loftek Nexus 543 is a good all-around surveillance camera.

The outdoor rating means it can withstand jets of water, as well as extremely hot or cold tempuratures, and probably even the occasional rock or baseball that your neighbor's kids will throw at it.From my research and experience, the Nexus 543 has the same firmware and networking features as Loftek's CXS 2200 wireless pan-and-tilt camera, which I also own and frequently use. You can view the camera's live feed through most browsers and manually record live video to a PC on your network in MJPEG format. You can also view footage of your other IP cameras on the same interface.Although the web interface doesn't look very polished, it's easy to navigate. The camera supports DDNS, so you can assign its web interface to a standard URL for remote access, which is useful for users without a static IP address.The cam streams video at up to 640x480 resolution, and its saved images seem to be the same quality as stills from the MJPEG. Based on my experience, the Nexus 543 is a great security camera, with sturdy build quality and effective night vision.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good image, poor software", "Author": "S. Erholm \"Scotty\"", "ReviewID": "RLCY6I4D30MTB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As others have mentioned, the setup software is not good. If you have a Windows machine, the setup is just amateurish.  If you use Mac or Linux, you likely need to know how to manipulate the settings on your router in order to configure the camera.The default IP for this cam is 192.168.0.178.  If the subnet of your router is also 192.168.0 then you can just use a Web browser to access the camera directly via the IP.  If your router is configured otherwise, you will need to be able to login to it and change the mask or the subnet.  Once you get the wired network for the camera set up as you wish (either via browser or poor Windows software), then you can access the camera and set many features.So set up can be painful, especially for non-Windows users, but then the camera works well.  The image quality surprised me for a cam of this price, and the IR LEDs actually work quite well to \"see\" in the dark up to about 30-40 feet (not as much as the claim of 25 meters).  The cam can upload images periodically to any server with FTP capabilities, or can also email them.  You can control the frequency of the uploads by specifying how many seconds.  Theoretically then, you could upload an image every second for real-time remote viewing, if your network connection is fast enough.  Every minute or five minutes is more realistic.Bottom line: If you need a really easy plug-n-play camera, spend a little more for a Panasonic with much better software.  If you need a really great image, then you need to spend 5 to 10 times more.  If you can deal with some setup issues and look past the really poor software, then the camera features, capabilities, and image quality are as good as cameras costing at least 2x as much.

It agreeably surprised me on both counts.It has built-in motion detection and upon detection will allow you to be notified by email, upload the picture to ftp and/or update an http of your choice.It allows for the default admin account to be changed (which some other do not which would be a major security issue for me) and connects to my router over WPA-TKIP.the ftp upload can also be configured on a regular basis, which is the feature I am using at the moment to feed sensr.net with recent captures.overall, this has worked right out of the box for me which I was very weary of but no, everything went as scripted.Do note that the CD coming with the camera has windows-only software on it so if you are a mac-only house (or shop), the only way you can make this work would be if your network is a 192.168.0, then you can hit [...] and hit the camera from there directly. In my case, my network is different and I had to use the excellent search tool provided, which found the camera and allowed me to make the camera available on my network.Overall just great!!!no complaints, I will buy 4 more to put under the eaves all around the house.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worked for under 24 hours", "Author": "WendyKellyBudd", "ReviewID": "R3CP288VKGLYBN",

The second one arrived out of focus, I'll probably do a review on that one too.This problem started within 24 hours and continues day and night.  The camera is mounted.  Loftek offered to replace the camera, but I ordered a new one (again, it arrived and is out of focus)Loftek Nexus 543 outdoor wireless/wired waterproof IP camera 4mm lens and 70\u00b0 viewing angle,36 Infrared LEDs with night vision up to 25M,easy installation, Silver grey.On the upside, I am very good at installing these cameras.  I've had three so far, 2 of these and one Loftek CXS 3200.  The CXS stopped working in a cool room, within their stated temp specs.All three make a fast ticking when in night mode.  If you want audio, good luck.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Capable IP Camera", "Author": "sonyboy", "ReviewID": "R29SPKT7YN5XQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loftek's Nexus 543 wireless IP camera is compact and easy to use, even for non computer experts. It's got some handy features including automatic infrared illumination and inputs for external sensors and alarms, and for the price, it's hard to find a camera with the same performance.The Nexus 543 is useful if you want to use it with your existing wireless network, and is well-suited for monitoring a doorway, or for watching over a backyard or garage. If you want to place the camera far away from your router or hub, it might be a good idea to connect it using a LAN cable instead of using the wireless connection, which might not be able to span a long distance.A quick setup guide is included on the installation CD, as well as more detailed directions in the usual manual, and it also has included software which has more options than the browswer-based access that is standard. For example, you can view a ton of cameras (supposedly up to 60, if you're that kind of person). You can also record your footage and set up intervals for automatic recording and alarm settings, etc.Once you've installed the camera, you can access it over your wireless network, or you can mess around with your router settings if you want to watch it from another location. This takes a little bit of work, but is definitely worth it if you want to be able to see your camera while you're not at home. The camera's resolution of 640x480 has adequate video quality to identify people and vehicles, but there is no control for pan and tilt, so camera placement is quite important.The browser accessed video feed works in both Internet Explorer and Firefox, and has a slew of features that can be controled from here, of which the motion detection is especially useful. You can configure the camera to email you or upload shots to an FTP server when motion is detected in the user-specified area.Based on the features, appearance, and installation requirements, Loftek's Nexus 543 is a great outdoor camera that's easy to use and well-priced.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera For The Price", "Author": "VABuyer", "ReviewID": "R3IX6ODWXYML92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on cameras before I chose to buy this camera.  This is my first security camera and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I put this camera over my front door and it picks up good detail out to about 20-30 feet, even at night.  The picture is still good beyond that but there is some lose on clarity (face detail).  If I installed this in the eve of a house I don't think the picture detail would be as good at that height.The setup was quite simple and took about 20 minutes.  Just be sure to connect the camera to your router with a cable first.  A have a D-Link DIR-655 Xtreme N Gigabit Router and the camera connected wirelessly without a hitch.

If you are tech savvy and know your way around network settings its easy, if you are not there are plenty of online how-to articles on setting this up.-I will not review the viewing software, I use a third party vendor software both for local and remote viewing.As things are now, I am very happy with this purchase.

Rather than spike strips I decided on an IP camera.  After looking around at a few I settled on the 543.  Overall, for the money, at first it seemed like a pretty decent camera.  That changed in less than a month, though.The only reason I gave this \"one star\" is because I had to give it at least one to get the review posted.The mount is OK, but expect to use pliers to tighten things up enough to keep the camera from moving.  I have strong hands and still needed to use pliers to get the mount to hold solidly at the ball.  The housing is very substantial and looks to be totally weatherproof.  So far the camera has withstood several snow storms and some heavy rain as well.  The cable connections are not weatherproof and need to be inside a weather tight enclosure or even a plastic bag.The setup was a snap using an Ethernet cable into my hub.  Wireless connection also works quite nicely as long as you can stay in range.  Another problem is that the antenna is kind of \"low end\".  Mine broke on the first day when trying to position it properly to get a decent signal into the router.  I have replaced it with a high gain antenna and it does work OK but I am also going to run an Ethernet cable out to the camera to improve the frame rate.  The camera is about 125 feet from the router and I think if it were closer the wireless frame rate, bandwidth/connection speed, would be better.The daytime picture is quite good as long as there's not too much sunlight.  Once the bright sun hits its field of view it starts switching contrast/brightness with, apparently, the auto gain control in full saturation and unable to remain locked and stable.  This renders the camera useless in bright, daytime, conditions.  The camera faces north-northwest and \"down\" in my font yard so the sun is not getting directly onto the lens.  The night time picture quality is surprisingly good.  I'm not sure that the range is as great as advertised, but I would guess that at 50 feet you can make out a face from it.I can't say that I'm impressed with the support from Loftek.  According to the page I ordered from, the order is through Loftek and fulfilled by Amazon.  I have sent a total of four questions to Loftek and haven't received an answer to any of them, yet, and it's been over a month.  That is not very encouraging.The software for monitoring the camera is kind of basic.  It may work OK for some people, but I wanted more flexibility and purchased Blue Iris.  I am not interested in viewing the camera from outside of my local network, but I think port forwarding could be setup fairly easily.I have emailed Loftek a total of four times asking questions about the camera, from a software/browser problem I solved myself, to a problem with the brightness of the picture changing in bright sunlight at about a 1 second rate.  I have yet to receive the courtesy of a reply after a month.  If you want an IP camera, look elsewhere, Loftek DOES NOT SUPPORT THEIR OWN PRODUCT!I've had it with this camera.  For the price, it seemed a good trade off of quality and price, but the support, no support, from Loftek and the constant flashing in brightness/contrast during times of bright sunlight have rendered it basically useless.  Amazon was nice enough to offer a full refund when I contacted them regarding the failure of the camera and Loftek.  Personally, I will not be ordering any more Loftek cameras.

However, I can't say the same for the one I just purchased.First, the 5v power supply comes with the wrong size tip making the camera unusable.  Based on a comment in another review that reported the same problem, I tried a power supply from one of my other cameras only to find that it would not boot even though I can hear the camera boot / reset when the power is first connected.I'm hopeful the seller will be able to provide a working unit.UPDATE - UPDATE - UPDATE - UPDATEThe seller eventually sent me a replacement camera after I returned the defective one.  Much to my surprise, the replacement camera also had the wrong power supply in the box.As with the other camera, I tried a power supply from a working camera and I can hear the camera boot and I can even hear it switch between day and night modes - BUT I NEVER GET AN ETHERNET NETWORK LINK LIGHT.  So, with no network connectivity this camera is basically a brick.This sounds to be the same issue that others are having.  Just look at the comments in chronological order.I'm extremely disappointed that they shipped me a camera with the wrong power supply AGAIN after my explicit request to either send me one that has been tested or to refund my money.So far this has been the WORST experience I've ever had with any Amazon purchase.

This is a review that really needs to be 3.5 stars, but without that option and with some major usability challenges and browser dependencies, three stars it is.Overall, the camera is physically robust. In fact, I dropped it while placing it in its final operational location (from three feet onto a tile floor), and it passed this unintentional test with flying colors. Read the specs: it's large, so is clearly best for outdoor or voluminous indoor spaces. It will be rather awkward if placed in sight in most residential-scale places.Color and clarity are fine, and switching between visible and IR are instantaneous and problem free.The drawbacks of this camera come from its controlling software. In short, users can expect a four-part process:(1) assign internal IP address (wired).(2) set up video control.(3) configure internal wireless settings.(4) configure remote access wireless settings.Although the wireless features will work with Firefox and Chrome, they are optimized for Internet Explorer. So even though this is an IP-based camera, don't expect it to be Unix-friendly.None of these are for the technologically faint of heart. You MUST be comfortable with internal IP address configuration options (in both the camera software and your router). This camera's configuration is controlled through two separate programs, and has to be done in sequence. Initial set up begins with a wired ethernet connection and then moves to wireless options.Once configured (in either wireless or wired modes), the camera is enabled with options for either scheduled or motion detection recordings. I now enjoy audible alarms whenever the cat approaches his food dish.The unit ships with an adequate quick start guide. A longer user guide is included on the accompanying CD as a Word document. One of the understandable challenges this vendor faced is that they couldn't possibly be successful in providing settings for every router potentially being operated by all users. If you feel like the user guide doesn't give instructions that address your router's interface closely enough, you can find assistance online (both at youtube and portforwarding dot com). While I am not a programmer, I am certain that some of the initial configuration could be automated on the installation CD to create a better out of the box experience.Finally, although the camera body may be weatherproof,  the combined ethernet/DC power dongle and the wall wart AC adapter don't appear especially robust, so you'll have to make provisions for their protection. Obviously, placement will be dependent on availability of an AC power outlet or extension cord.Note: I received this item at no charge.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not suited for outdoor use, but good support", "Author": "ecellingsworth", "ReviewID": "R30BCMAIE50ECO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Edit 3/31/14: The replacement camera I received after one had filled with rain is now dead. We had an exceptionally cold winter for the southern United States. Problems started around the beginning of winter with the camera disappearing from the network occasionally. Near mid-winter the camera was MIA about 50% of the time. I noticed it would be working during the daylight hours when it was warm but would stop responding around midnight when the cold would set in. Now, with winter over, the camera no longer responds at all. I haven't taken the time to determine if the problem is the power supply or the camera. I'm hoping it's the former. I still have one camera working (for 2 years now) under a patio roof that has never had problems. Even so, I can't recommend these for outside use. I've changed the title of my review from \"Not weather proof, but good support\" to \"Not suited for outdoor use, but good support\". I've changed my star rating from 4/5 to 2/5 since I've had two cameras die in 2 years.The original review is below.I have two of these cameras installed outside. The first is mounted under the patio roof and is working well. However, this location seems to block WiFi. I installed a second wireless access point close by, but it didn't help. When I swap the other camera to this position, it has the same problem, but works fine elsewhere. Therefore, I ran an ethernet cable directly to this camera - problem solved. This camera has been on continuously for about 3 months. The image has developed a small blemish. I thought it was dirt but cleaning the lens didn't help. I'm still not sure if this is from the camera itself, but it doesn't really affect anything.The second camera was originally installed on the exterior of the house, directly exposed to the weather. WiFi worked fine in this location, but after ~ 2 months the camera picture started going in and out until it was barely ever on. I inspected the camera and found it had filled inside with water from recent rain showers. I emailed Loftek's support and was asked to take a photo of the defective camera which I did. Without any further questions I was given an RMA number and asked to mail the camera to some place in California. Once the camera arrived, they immediately shipped me a replacement (new) that I've since reinstalled under an overhang in the same location. It's working fine now for a week. My positive experience returning the defective camera is what prompted me to write this review. Even with one water-logged camera, I would feel confident buying from this company again.Here's a summary of my opinions:1. Customer support = 10/10. Quick and courteous. Search the reviews and you'll see they even leave comments. This is a company that cares about how it is perceived.2. Weather proof = 5/10. Should be fine in a covered location. Definitely keep out of the rain, etc.3. Picture quality = 8/10. Really, it's what you'd expect for 640x480 resolution. Colors are adequate.4. Night vision = 9/10. IR LED's won't cover your whole yard, but work great in small spaces. IR filter is a plus.5. WiFi = 7/10. Works, but really depends on shielding and noise sources around the camera. For dependable connection, I highly recommend hardwiring IP cameras.6. Aesthetics = 10/10. Looks imposing to criminals.7. Software setup = 8/10. I had no trouble. The last one took me all of 5 minutes to configure. It helps to have some networking experience though.8. Motion detection = 9/10. Simple and effective. Emails me 5 frames at each event. Detection works better than Zoneminder, in my opinion. However, I've noticed that during motion events, third party recording software (Zoneminder) is denied frames, which is a shame. Best to use one or the other, not both at the same time.9. Durability = 10/10. Metal body feels firm. No mechanical problems to date.10. Features = 9/10. Has a lot of configuration options. I didn't give it 10/10 because there's no built-in way to disable the manufacturers DDNS service (though Loftek has a program on it's site that can do this). And, there is only a few 3rd party DDNS service providers in the pre-programmed list and no way to add more, which is a little restrictive.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well made camera.

Further investigation found the focus and depth on a fixed lens, fixed aperture will vary slightly with brightness. Loftek did provide refocusing instructions, but I decided to leave well enough alone.  Loftek also provides an software API, which allows interfacing to existing web and server applications.

Setting these network cameras was as simple as 1-2-3-4. If you want easy to understand instructions that will get you up and running wirelessly fast you should go to Loftek's website and select the 543 model. At their website you can download/view easy to understand instructions that will take you step by step. It took me less than 10 minutes to set both of these cameras up wirelessly. You will need a PC or windows running on your Mac to first setup the network cameras. Once you have set the cameras set up on your local network you will need different software if you want to use your MAC to record content from the Loftek cameras. I scoured the net for \"ip camera software for Mac\" and came up with the wonderful MAC program called EvoCam. The program is free to download and gives you 15 days of full use for free, after 15 days you will have to purchase it. The program only cost me $20 with a student discount, otherwise it's $30. Although the Loftek camera is not listed as one of the network cameras on this program I found that you can use the \" Foscam Network Camera (1)\" setting and it will work like a charm. You can set a recording schedule for your cameras. You will need to customize a window for each camera on the EvoCam software. I recommend setting up a folder for each camera.Installing the camera: You HAVE to use the included 5v ac adapter to power the camera. You will need to splice off of an outdoor power source such as an outdoor light. I spliced off of my front door light and my backdoor light. Buy a small outdoor electrical box at a place like Lowe's and buy a small female plug receptacle. Wire the positive and negative terminal on the female plug receptacle and connect the positive and negative wire to the positive and negative wire at the outdoor wiring (outdoor light source wiring in back of outdoor light). Drill a hole at the bottom of the small electrical box that will allow the wiring to pass through the electrical box. The small electrical box will house the adapter and plug receptacle. Plug the adapter into the female plug receptacle and run the wiring through the hole at the bottom of the electrical box. Screw the cover back on the small electrical box affix teh electrical on your house near where you want to install the camera. Install the camera. BEFORE you mess with the electrical wiring turn the power off at your fuse box so you don't get electrocuted.Camera quality: The infrared night-vision works nice and is clear. These cameras have pretty good resolution. You get 30 fps (frames per second) with this camera which is pretty good. I like the cameras so far and they seem to be weatherproof as advertised. I've had them up and running for about a week, so far so good. I really like the EvoCam software for my Mac. My Imac works perfect with this software, I run it 24 hrs a day and my Imac is so quiet you can hear a pin drop. If you are using an IMAC make sure that you have your setting so that the hard drive doesn't cut off (energy saver mode) and doesn't go to sleep. Your display can cut off but not your computer, NO SLEEP MODE. Go to APPLE>SYSTEM Perferences>Energy Save>Computer Sleep --> slide to \"Never\". Uncheck the \"put Hard drive to sleep\" box if it is checked. If you don't do this you will wake up to frozen EvoCam windows that show searching. If you get a freeze you will have to go to your username and then the library folder and then delete the \"com.evocam\" file to reset it and then you will have to redo all of your settings all over again and add the network camera settings again. I recommend getting a backup power source b/c any interruption in power will make you have to reset the program and redo all of the settings again.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'd buy it again", "Author": "Karl Kuzbiel", "ReviewID": "R3QUTEO8VSUB9V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looks like this is a generic China-made camera.

Started looking about a month ago, reading reviews on what new offering out there that is available. Reason I want to replace is that one of the unit outdoor is dead, the other one indoor is still functional, the 2nd reason, Wilife system does not have night vision.Decide to give the loftek brand a try. I ordered 2 of these November 24 and got it 5 days later.As everyone knows, the documentation is pretty spotty, but once you go thru the CD and manuals, you can pretty much puzzle the documentation together and go forth what you really need to do.You have to connect the camera WIRED during initial setup, and use the utility that came with called > BSearch_en.exe to configure cameras IP address of your network, username/pass(default info on documentation or sticker in the body of the camera), and PORT you want to use BESIDES 80 or 8080 to get it to connect.Wireless function, go to the Network configuration > Wireless tab and put the information of your network wireless to detect.If your wireless SSID is hidden, temporarily unhide it to assist the camera to find your wirelessOnce configured power off camera and disconnect the RJ45 wired connection. Power on, wait 10 to15 seconds for it to switch to wireless function. Once wireless is up, you can finish off configuring the rest.One of the 2 cameras I originally ordered will not work with the wireless. After careful observation, the gold connector where the wireless antenna connects to the camera body is not there. End up returning this unit. There is no exchange option with seller, once Amazon got the defective camera, immediate full amount refund + return shipping cost amount. Nice!Immediately order the 2nd  replacement camera.Moving forwardWhile waiting for the other replacement to come, I finish configuring the first camera.CAN NOT get the included software called > IPCmonitor to work.I tried installing on 6 different computers with OS, XP, vista, W7 x32 /X64, 2k3 or 2K8 x32 /X64 versions. NADA!Work with technical support (only email support) for 3 days, email tags back and forth but never really connected with them as they wanted to connect to my computer using TeamViewer remote due to time zone difference with emails. There technical support must be outside the USAI end up buying BlueIris multi-view version and got it to work.The camera also works remote view on my blackberry and IPAD outside my network to monitor using the browser function.Email, took some time to trace why not sending but it end up a combo issue of firewall and anti-virus software blocking SMTP broadcast.Initial impression of first camera, for a 640x480, pix and video are clear day time, night vision is also clear.End up using WIRED connection versus wireless as I did not want to move my wireless router location which is located the other side corner of my house. It will work but want the steady connection of 15 -18 FPS versus 5 - 2 FPS on wireless. Note: 2 cameras together wired, FPS goes down to 10-12 FPSAfter 4 days of using the first camera, I notice from comparison with original video and pix captured that the camera pix quality now has deteriorated somewhat. Just thought it might be just the weather.Another is I am getting alerts that the camera resets 2 to 4 times at night. No biggy, the BlueIris software attempts to restarts the camera and it does.The 2nd replacement camera finally came and was configured. All is working. Once up, the initial impression was WOW, this one has a nice pix and video. The colors are true Green and grass is not brown, the images are sharp and clear. It made me think that the first camera has some issues with contrast and Brightness, so I mess with the first camera setting to equal the setting of the 2nd replacement camera. Close but not quite there.Now, the 2nd replacement camera at night. Low light with just the porch light by the driveway is ON, IR is OFF on camera,  I CAN NOT see anything except small dot where light is reflected back like signal light reflectors off your car.NO LIGHTS ON driveway, IR is ON the Camera, it looks like I am looking at a barrel of shotgun or being time warp to another universe! The pix and video, there is a HALO view around the corners, pix and video is warped/distorted with 6 white dot spot around it. I can't get to recognition images off this!Decided to mess with the brightness and contrast as well for night time, but the HALO effect is still there. Original thought is that the IR LED reflection when ON might be bouncing off the shiny hood of the camera. I decided to put electrical black tape on the inside part of the hood, maybe it that what causing the warp/distorted with 6 white dot reflection on this camera. Nope, the same!Next day, since I started messing around with the contrast/brightness setting on both cameras the night before, Day time setting now looks washout on the replacement camera, the original camera, I now have a 3D images of pix and video. It looks like 3D vision on a LCD panel looking at it without the 3D glasses.It gives me a headache!Oh geez, could it be that I am spacing out! Not! I open up my old original 4 year old Wilife camera system and oh boy, these 2 new cameras do not even come close to the pix/video quality.Decided to give both loftek cameras another try by resetting both to Factory defaults, and move them back inside to my warm computer room for further evaluation.Results are the same.Original camera now has a 3D image effect day or night and progressively getting worse2nd replacement camera, pix are great in daytime but at night IR ON, Halo and 6 white dots present no matter what I do. By the way, both cameras are on the latest and greatest firmware update.Also, it is not the BlueIris software causing this because when I use the original viewing software from loftek, same issue and the output for pix and video is even worse.Both cameras are returned back to Amazon My opinion is that the CAMERA QUALITY control is not there. Most of these cameras probably came from the same one or 2 manufacturers. Some people reviews states that there camera works great for a while and other not. For the amount you are paying for this unit, you have a 50/50 chance on the deal so give it a try.End up getting an EasyN and a Vivotek outdoor models using blue Iris.

I prefer to use the wireless option as it optimizes the locations of my cameras.Once you open up the box, attach the wireless antenna, power it on and hook in an Ethernet cable to your router, it's time for setup.

This camera hands down is great, especially for the cost -- and it still works great today.  Recently I bought two more Nexus 543 cameras only to be really disappointed.  One camera has a focus issue, everything is fuzzy and night-time viewing is all but useless.  The other new camera has to be rebooted several times to get rid of a ghastly negative image that it resorts to intermittently.  It is bright pink and green -- rebooting the camera seems to be the only way to fix it when it happens - I may create a routine to reboot it everyday just as a precaution.  Besides the obvious loss of quality, these new cameras are indeed silver in color.We all know that over the lifespan of a product that companies do rework and downgrade components to save on manufacturing cost.  The quality of this camera has suffered due to that.  My old Nexus 543 has better image day and night over the two new Nexus 543s I just bought.  The mounting hardware on the new cameras is inferior to the mounting assembly that came with my old Nexus 543 which I still use, even though I have moved it countless times.In short, don't buy the new Nexus 543 camera, if you can find an old \"Lilac\" colored one, invest in that -- it will probably last forever.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent quality product, the price is pretty good comparison of the product.

There's something wrong with the camera's DHCP client, it does not work well with the Static DNS I tried setting up on my Router, you can specify a fixed IP address on the camera though. As far as I'm concerned this should be plug & play with auto DHCP - I should not even have to use some S/W to get it set up with an IP address. I was able to activate the motion sensing, ftp, email just fine. It would not email me pictures though, it only sends out a notification when it detects motion.I had a lot of trouble getting wireless to work, as mentioned earlier I found out the hard way that this thing does not work with 802.11n. Next I tried 802.11g and it would not initially work with that either, it turns out that it uses a hidden MAC address for Wifi (it only shows the wired MAC address on its Device Info page). I have MAC address filtering set up on my Router and even though I added the MAC address it showed on its device info page because it used a different MAC address on wifi it would not work. I had to turn off MAC filtering to get this thing on the network and had to look through the wireless devices page of my Router to get the wifi MAC address of the Camera. Once I added that to the MAC address filter I was able to turn MAC address filtering back on.Build-wise, it feels solid. The picture quality is nothing to write home about but it is a security camera so I did not have much expectation there. Infrared is Ok, you are not going to be able to recognize faces with the infrared it will only help to detect motion.To view images you have to log on to the camera with a userid & password, it worked with Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari on my iphone. for Internet Explorer it wanted to download some plug-in which I did not and so I could not see images from that browser.To sum up, if you are not a tech savvy person please avoid this camera and save yourself a lot of hassle.-->Update 8/31/11I'd like to correct the part about not getting images in email.

It was no fluke.In setting up the camera, and using the setup software provided, and when scanning the network to find the camera, that software wiped out the settings in a powerline ethernet system such that that system stopped working, and required a complete reset to factory settings and a new setup in order for them to work again.  I never did get the camera to work on my home network -- not even wired.After this happened the first time, I then set up the camera on an isolated network, using an isolated laptop, connected by ethernet to an isolated router.  The only devices connected to that router were the laptop and the camera.  I was able to get the camera working, but only when wired.  The camera WOULD NOT connect to the isolated network wirelessly.Having demonstrated that the camera would indeed work, I then attempted to set the camera up on my home network.  Once again I used the scanning software, but the camera was never found.  Again, the camera would not even work wired.BUT -- once again, the entire powerline ethernet devices, (which were not even in play for the camera setup as the camera was hard wired to the router via a switch, but data was not transported via the powerline system in this configuration) -- once again the setup configuration of that powerline ethernet system was wiped out, would not function, had to be set up from scratch again.So -- there is s 1:1 correlation of using the scanning software and the powerline system being disabled.  Twice.  Make that correlation 2:2 then.  Results in a pretty high X^2 value.By the way -- both times this happened, the wireless router had to be cold reset, and the wireless access point in a remote part of my home had to be cold reset, because none of the 7 computers on the network would communicate with the router wired or wirelessly -- this in addition to the powerline system being totally disabled.  Everything with an IP address on the network -- some 27 devices (computers, VoIP adapters, NAS drives, network printers, Slingbox, alarm system IP interface, smartphone WiFi connections, weather station) -- including both dynamic and static IP addresses -- had to be reset.  The system didn't just not work on my network -- it DISABLED numerous devices on my network -- TWICE.And -- I never did get the wireless side of the camera to work.  Wired yes, but only when on an isolated network.  Wireless -- no way.For the few minutes that the camera did provide images while wired, looks like it might have been an OK solution for what I was looking for.  If only it worked wirelessly as advertised  ..........  and didn't destroy every connection on my network.But I just WILL NOT tolerate somebody sending software into my network that damages settings and disables devices.  I haven't had to deal with issues like this since I fought with SCSI cards and IRQ settings.  Unbelievable.Note to manufacturer:  Let me know when you guys figure out what plug-n-play means.
