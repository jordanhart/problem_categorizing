It runs 24hrs a day and I'm quite satisfied. Resolution isn't HD, but to get that level of resolution you'd have to pay 5 or 6 times the cost.  For a low cost splitter, I would highly recommend this product.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does what I need.", "Author": "MD \"deek139\"", "ReviewID": "R1LK1EHOLW4I4J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this as an inexpensive way to add additional cameras to my 4 channel DVR. It worked well and was fairly east to set up. After about 2 months the picture became distorted. I contacted the company and returned the unit. They promptly determined it was a bad unit and shipped me out a new one. I am not happy it broke but was happy with the customer service of Evertech.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Video garbage", "Author": "FOXFIRE", "ReviewID": "R23FJBWNRPIMFC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It is not user friendly.
