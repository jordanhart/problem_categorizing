{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not the greatest quality, but also not the worst", "Author": "relbeis", "ReviewID": "R3SHYZTKS257P3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received my camera today, so I don't have all that much experience with it.  However, I did want to post my first impression of it so other customers have at least something to base their decision off of.First off, I wanted to mention that I bought this camera because I want to be able to take photos and video in or near water and I don't trust myself to use my good cameras for that - I chose this one because my Kodak PlaySport crapped out after one use and this wasn't too expensive.  I was nervous preordering this, but so many other waterproof cameras had mixed reviews so I figured I'd give this one a shot.This camera is VERY basic.  Something I'm not used to.  I own a Canon DSLR and a Canon point and shoot that both have manual modes and ways to adjust ISO and whatnot.  This camera doesn't even show you the ISO.  It has a few scene modes like night, macro, underwater, fireworks, etc.The charging just completed, so I played around with it in the low light of my living room (haven't been able to try it in daylight yet).  The photos taken with the flash are pretty decent, but appear grainy when you zoom in closer on the computer screen.  If you printed one out in an 8 x 10 size, I don't think it would be very good quality.  The photos taken without the flash are very grainy.  The photos taken using zoom with or without the flash are very grainy.  The photos taken in macro mode are not clear at all.The video quality in low light is absolutely terrible.  The sound is very low.  However, you can hear every click of the zoom button as I zoomed in and out.  I'll have to play around and see if any improvements can be made.I'll keep it, because it seems good enough to have around the pool.  My fingers are crossed that the quality is better in daylight.Will update as I use it more.UPDATE 3/11/14 - I still haven't used it in daylight yet, but I just used the video function in the brighter light of our bathroom.  I thought about putting it in the tub while I gave my daughter a bath to see how it holds up in water, but there really wasn't anything to take pictures/video of besides baby toes.  So I just recorded her splashing around a bit.  The quality in brighter light was actually a lot better.  The sound was so so.  I'm happy with the video for the most part.UPDATE 3/14/14 - I finally used the camera in daylight.  The quality is good.  Not fantastic, but good.  The quality when you take a photo zoomed in on something still isn't very good, but it's passable.  I also changed my review from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I've been comparing the quality to my DSLR and to my $350 point and shoot.  Those two cameras are obviously better quality, so it wasn't really fair of me to compare.  A few years ago, I had tried an inexpensive Fujifilm FinePix XP10 waterproof camera - it was pure crap.  This camera is far superior.  For what I paid for this camera and for what I intend to use it for, it appears to be a good choice.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great, so far.", "Author": "Sonja Dutch \"Video hunter\"", "ReviewID": "R2RUA7TRIVQ7AP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything is really working great on this camera so far.  Had a problem transferring videos with Picasa, must have been something to do with the format of the chip I used.  .  But I was able to transfer with Windows into my computer so not a big issue.  I cannot say yet how well it works in the Ocean (Salt Water) yet, as we won't be using it for that until our vacation in Oct.  Everything else is exceptional.  Very easy to use,  Clear vivid colors.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Used two times and it was broke", "Author": "preziosi", "ReviewID": "R35MLPHUCXMXID", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst camera.  Nikon disappointed me.  The first time the button broke when I used like three times.  They send me the same camera new. I have it just for underwater pics, so as soon as I took the first picture underwater it was all cover in water and sand on the inside.  This is not my first underwater camera I know how to take care of them.  Nikon failed in this camera and in the service.  PLEASE PEOPLE DON'T BUY IT.

I must say though, that the Nikon people were helpful but I still had to pay eight dollars for shipping to the repair facility.Update: after three and a half weeks I received my camera from the repair shop. Can you imagine...they sent me the camera without its rechargeable battery. Now what, Nikon.

Some times it doesn't focus and video is all out of focus.5/23/2014, flash doesn't fire anymore.Totally disappointing... utter piece of crap. Waste of money.

It takes terrible (out of focus and blue) underwater pictures and showed \"Memory Exhausted\" when only 10 pictures were taken on a 32GB memory card.  The throw-away plastic cameras take better underwater pictures than this camera!! I tried to return it but Amazon said I had to have sent it back by yesterday--June 1st.  I've owned a number of Nikon Cool Pix cameras and this one is not up to Nikon standards. Don't waste your money on it!! I'm really disappointed about the camera and the short return period--that I wasn't aware of when I purchased it.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Unintellagble sound with Video", "Author": "Nostromo", "ReviewID": "R3G49Z0DVJFAEX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The photos taken with the Nikon S32 were good, the Video I took looked good, but the Sound with the video was real bad. Considering that this is camera designed to be used near and in the water the sound quality is unacceptable . Once the camera was wet and I took a video above the water the sound was completely muffled and unintelligible. What good is a 1080 HD video with terrible sound? I have had other waterproof cameras and had no problem with video sound  even coming directly out of the water.

Using flash or not, regardless of image size there is allot of pixilation noise going on in the background of almost all images.  Macro shots barely acceptable in my opinion.  (even after choosing macro mode) Even with the large image setting, ANY zooming in on the picture will show much graininess.Outside not in direct sunlight the pictures seemed to be much better, none of that pixilation noise in the background, but again any zooming in on the picture looks like it's an 8-bit Nintendo game.The saving grace for this camera will be that it is kid friendly near water + sand.  If I did not need it for that, I would not be happy. The video mode seemed to be decent also, not really interested in that aspect at the moment, but all sample videos I took inside or outside seemed to be decent quality.If I remember to I will update this review after further experience with this camera.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best camara ever", "Author": "Rebe", "ReviewID": "R18NRWHX73QU96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I truly recommend this camara is awesome, is a great waterproof product with high quality images.
