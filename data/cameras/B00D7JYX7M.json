Still have not been able to make it work reliably using any of the various methods.Slow to take pictures - auto-focus is really slow.It feels cheap.The telephoto lens that came with it is almost useless.Do yourself a favor and buy a good point and shoot camera with optical zoom.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best birthday gift ever!", "Author": "Ashley Hanes \"EvelynHarlot\"", "ReviewID": "R3B9FOYDEDRCRU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered this for my boyfriends birthday, he's been looking at camera's for months now and he loves Samsung products.
