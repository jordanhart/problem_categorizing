I bought this for my mom who just wanted to have a simple camera to make some special days memorable to herself and before her I tried several shots myself to teach her how to use it. I was so surprised at the clarity of the photos I took. One of my friends had it and had told me that it was so good and I was suspicious about her comment as I always thoght some higher brands were always better. But now I found out I was wrong. No need to empty your pocket to take a good picture. This good value one does that job very well. Apparently Fuji is able to surprise photo enthusiasts.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Gary Parlato", "ReviewID": "R2PB5FW1BDEC42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content":

It will take me a long time to get around to learning everything you can do with it. So far i have not had one blurred picture. It has so many different settings on it for different shots you can use. It has special features for just face shots, night scenery, text shots for close ups and a lot more. I am using it in auto-mode most of the time. The panorama shots are great. When i use text setup i can get good shots of text on those little bitty manuals with the small print.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "arrived defective", "Author": "Don Erickson \"Dieter\"", "ReviewID": "RNJLZAJDNFJIL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We never got to use the camera.
