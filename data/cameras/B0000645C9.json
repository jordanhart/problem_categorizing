{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pocket-sized, but not small on features!", "Author": "Jesse Garner", "ReviewID": "RNVAB9EUWEIT9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my S200 for three weeks now, and just had to post and let others know this is a great camera. This is my first digital camera, and after much research, I'm pleased to think I got exactly what I needed.Pros:- Sturdy! Portable! I work at a summer camp and wanted a camera I could take around with me and not worry about. I've already dropped this camera several times (pretty hefty drop once) but the metal casing is sturdy enough to take abuse. As always, be careful, but you won't have to worry about breaking this camera. You also won't have to worry about lugging a huge camera around and having to set it down everywhere. Shorts, swimsuit, whatever - it'll fit in your pocket.- Print Quality: I got my first ofoto.com order the other week and the pictures look GREAT. I was worried that 2 mpxls wouldn't be enough, but even the 8x10 I ordered came out fine. Make sure you have a large memory card (I have a 128 mb one) and take pictures on the best possible setting.- Good battery life: I've seen some bad ratings on this, but don't know why. I take lots of pictures and always use the LCD screen. With that usage, my battery lasts from about 7:30 in the morning until 11:00 at night. I just come home and charge it each night. If you turn the LCD screen off (and the camera off when you're not using it) it will last longer - I've used it for two days straight before charging it. Extra batteries are relatively inexpensive, so get one if you can, but you can always get one later and still enjoy your camera.Cons:- No case. You really need a case. I've gone caseless for three weeks now and there is a lot of lint inside my viewfinder (but no other problems). The Canon paperwork is a little confusing about which case is designed for the s200 (get a case designed for it - it's too small to fit anything but a made-to-order case), but check powershot.com to find out which one to order. It's a cheap way to protect your camera for a long time. Buy it online, too - I'm having a hard time finding a case in a store.- ZoombrowserEX. The software program that comes with the camera to organize your pictures and take them off the camera is not designed well. Windows don't pop up right, and it's easy to permanently delete some of your pictures (no recycle bin).- Slow. With the red eye reduction flash setting, it takes _forever_ to actually take a picture. Even the autoflash function is still slow. With plenty of light there's no problem, but the flashes tend to be a little slow (although, if you prefocus, there's not as much of a wait). Don't buy this for sports photography.-Uploading old images. I've had problems with taking pictures off my SimpleTech card and then putting them back on. Half the time the pictures are squished or streched, especially portraits. I'm not sure who's at fault for that, Canon or SimpleTech, but it makes it annoying when you want to share images with your flash card.Overall an excellent camera. I'm very excited about it and would recommend it to anyone who wants portability and great pictures. I picked the s200 over the s330 because of size (the s330 looks a lot bigger). None of the extra features on the s330 made up for the size difference.I tried to cover all the bases here. Hope this review from an amateur photographer helps.", "Date": "June 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R1T2Q39B7WJ7NA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You want the truth, can you handle the truth?  Let's begin with my title, \"The good, the bad, and the ugly\"...THE UGLY-well, there is no ugly.  The camera looks that good.  Just taking the camera with you will make you cool (I mean, not that I needed any help or anything, but if you do, that's ok and this is the camera for you).  The GOOD-for a camera the size of a, actually its the only little rectangular shaped thing I own that small.  It is small, period.  I carry it in my front jeans pocket when I go out and pretty much don't know its there.  I bought this camera knowing that it will be going with me on trips to Asia, and Europe and around town.  I don't like being a \"tourist\" (ie camera on shoulder, carry bags), so this camera is a dream.  I will add, it is surprisingly durable as well, you can tell as soon as you hold it.  OK, the Pictures.  LCD screen, awesome.  Bright, crisp, wish my TV was that good, hmmmm...wish my monitor was that good.  The photos, here is the deal.  You need to learn how to take pictures with the camera.  Outdoors, no biggie.  Takes great great pictures.  I have even entered some in contests.  Indoors-a little bit of a bummer.  My only real gripe with the camera.  Indoor pictures with any camera are not the easiest, but with digital, even harder.  I don't know about other digitals, but with the elph, lots of red eye and dark background.  A little trick-indoors in sufficient lighting situations, shut the flash OFF, and what you see in the LCD is what you get, usually a better picture than with flash.  With practice indoor shots will be sufficient.  Batteries, Cannon NB-1LH.  Right.  Because you don't know what that means, let me tell you.  You are not going to find them at Target, or 7-11.  They work pretty well though and the camera comes with a charger and one battery.  You probably won't buy an extra battery now, but later you will want an extra battery...trust me, I'm telling you.  Oh by the way...I am not a Cannon rep or anything, but ONLY buy the Cannon NB-1LH battery-again just trust me and listen.  8MB memory card-The camera comes with it, and it is enough memory for you to realize the camera is the greatest thing since sliced bread- you will want a bigger memory card.  Well, in conclusion:  Would I buy this camera again?  100% Yes.  The camera is just awesome.  You will have so so so much fun with it.  That I can guarantee.  Great pictures, video mode (with GOOD sound quality (only 12 seconds though)), comes with cables to hook up to the TV, probably one of the greatest things I have ever bought.  It is one of those deals where after buying it, you won't know how you lived without it before.  I don't know if a camera can add to the quality of a persons life, but you will definitely have more fun.  By the way, be prepared for every person you take a picture of to want to see your camera.  Prepare yourself now for the fact you are going to have other peoples fingerprints all over it.  :)  Peace out, and enjoy life!~", "Date": "January 17, 2003"}, {"Title": "fun and handy, room for improvement", "Author": "BookWoman", "ReviewID": "R6FZQXN22HA3B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is fantastic for convenience. It realistically fits in your pocket, and its compact brick-like shape means nothing is protruding and getting dented as you walk around. I take it places that I'd never take a larger camera, because I can bring it along without a big camera pack hanging off my shoulder. The main complaint I have is that the image quality isn't great. It's good enough for snapshots, but I've had a lot of so-so pictures. My former digital camera, an Olympus D-460 with only 1.3 megapixels, took sharper and better-looking images. A lot of my pictures on this camera look all right from far away but up close everything is a little fuzzy.Here's a summary of my pros and cons with the camera:Pluses:* Size -- it really can fit in your pocket.* The charger is small and light-weight and works in standard 2-prong 110V outlets.* Nice viewing of shots on the camera -- loads quickly and there is speedy and good navigation, even when I had 100s of pictures.* Battery life is great.* Video mode is a blast.* Battery charges quickly, around 2 hours from totally dead.* You can plug the camera into a TV with included cables and view your photos there.Minuses:* Picture quality isn't great.* Sometimes when you take a picture with the flash, it takes forever (we're talking holding the button for 10 seconds or more) to take. I found I could improve this by depressing the button slightly to get the light setting, seeing the red light go one, and *then* pushing hard to take the picture, then waiting another second or two for it to take. But try explaining that to a Chinese person who you don't know who's taking your picture for you!* No software included to create a slideshow. I was hoping for something that would make a nice picture-and-video slideshow.* The video mode can't adjust to different light settings in the course of filming, so whatever setting you start with is the same one it will maintain even when the light changes.* No warning before your battery dies. The warning light comes on and poof! 30 seconds later the camera's dead.* No sound on video playback on the camera (there is sound when the clip is downloaded to a computer or played on a TV).* Maximum imposed recording limit for videos, regardless of how much memory is on your memory card. At the middle quality setting it's about 10 seconds, and at the low quality about 30.Overall I think the camera's size makes it a good camera, it could use some improvements particularly in picture quality but for casual snapshots it'll do the job. A similar camera worth checking out is the Minolta Dimage X. It's slightly smaller, has longer video recording capability, greater zoom, and audio on video playback, but I've heard the picture quality is worse than the Elph.", "Date": "November 5, 2002"}, {"Title": "awesome little camera.", "Author": "Nikon131 \"Nikon131\"", "ReviewID": "ROHDNALHOBKJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Canon S200 for about a month now and am absolutley pleased with it's performance. First the design: it is literally the exact size as a pack of cigarettes. (with the cool weight of a tiny gadget like a zippo lighter) Very sturdy feel, feels like a block of metal in your hands. The case does not get smudges from fingerprints and have not noticed any scracthes from everyday use.Second, picture quality: I have only printed 4x6 prints onto photo quality paper from an Epson Photo printer and as an amateur photographer was amazed at the picture quality. Very crisp colors and details, from daytime outdoor pictures to nighttime indoor pictures. You can see tiny freckles on ppl's faces, good or bad I dont know. There is a macro mode for close-ups. A manual mode which is intuitive, for example, if you want to take Non-Flash shots where flash is not allowed, you dont have to set for No-flash everytime you turn the camera on and off. Set if for Manual Mode>No-Flash and everytime you turn the camera on and off the flash is automactically set off. (or vice-versa) ISO can me set, as well as shutter speed. which is also nice for more creative ppl, or for dark situations.Third Battery life: I recently took a trip to LA, with two 64mg Compact Flash cards (set for highest resolution each card held approx. 180 images: the camera \"says\" the card can hold 70 images, but i kept on going to experiment and got different from 180-200 images!) So everyday I would take 120-140 images, go to my hotel recharge the battery, which lasted the whole day, download the images to my laptop and be ready for the next day. and a note, whether you set for high or low resolution the camera takes same amount of time \"writing\" or recording to disk which is btw very fast. I have both Sandisk and Fuji brand compact flash cards and have not noticed any performance difference.I was deciding between the S200 and the S300 which are identical, except the S300 has 3X optical zoom instead of 2X, and also has a longer movie mode. 2MegaPixel is perfect for 4X6 prints and 8X10 prints also.If you are new to digital cameras you will be absolutley satisfied with this camera's print quality, ease of use, battery life, as well as more advanced features which I have not used yet such as the longer shutter speeds. A good online source for digital camera research can be found here: dpreview.com and canon's site has sample pictures taken with this camera.

The pictures I took were all great, the close up shots for detail shots are incredible perfect color and lighting everytime. I had a hard time between this one and a Canon A60. I had a Sony before this one and this one beats hands down. The Canon A60 has alot more features but a higher price tag. I got this one at my local Staples for $ 220.00 - BRAND NEW !!!!The case is small and sturdy stainless steel. Great pocket camera. It is not a pro camera, and not a basic point and shoot, it can record up to 1 minute with audio!!! It has a microphone!!!Bottom line it is a great buy and quality is excellent. I even took a picture with just a candle lit and it calibrated for light for a great shot!!!Why 4 stars, well the buttons are tiny, bigger hands will have a hard time with this camera, and a replacement battery is very expensive; although do a search on Ebay and many vendors have the battery for $10-15.00; as opposed to $50-60.00 on retail sites. As for memory cards go to Crucial.com for the cheapest memory anywhere!!! I got a 128 card for $25.00 !!! There prices do change.Pros: Compact and light, simple menu, easy to shoot, stainless steel case, cheap memory, movie mode, great shots, even in the dark!!!!Cons: Special cable for video(included) and USB, so don't lose them or you'll have to order direct from Canon; special battery- not AA's, too small for bigger hands.Final say: Great for trips, and to carry in your pocket, but if you have bigger hands and a few extra dollars, go with a Canon A60. The Canon A60 uses AA's and it's case is bigger(although plastic), and has a few more advanced features.", "Date": "April 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "I preferred this one over the PowerShot S330", "Author": "Dennis Guilder \"Dennis\"", "ReviewID": "R8MVD0Z1NP62W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took me a while to decide between this camera and the PowerShot S330.  I prefer the S330 for the way it looks and feels and for the fact that it allows to manually set the shutter speed.  I also like that feature that allows you to add voice memos to pictures taken.  The reason why I decided for the PowerShot S200 in the end is pocketability.  Although the S200 isn't much smaller in terms of inches, it feels a lot smaller than any other digital camera I have held in my hands so far.  I have had the S200 for a week now, and I just love it!  I had it with me almost everywhere I went.  It even fits into a shirt pocket without feeling too heavy!  That was my main reason for buying a digital camera anyways, I wanted to be able to bring it with me wherever I go.  The picture quality is o.k., as long as you don't zoom in too much they are fine.  I only store my pics on my pc and email them to people once in a while or post some pics online.  If I would want to make prints, I'd go for a camera with more megapixels.  But for prints I have a trusted Canon EOS 600 35mm.For the PowerShot S200 I also bought a small carrying case that clips on my belt as well as a spare battery.  I'm also going to buy a flash-card reader.  Oh, and of course I bought a 256MB Compact Flash Card.  So, it was quite an investment, but I love this camera, and it's size is just amazing.", "Date": "May 20, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "T. Tom", "ReviewID": "R3VXIH3JP5YCDC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Digital point and shoot cameras should not be looked at as a replacement to film cameras, the quality just isn't good enough for anything important or for images that you need to enlarge. But, for the convenience of being able to email your snapshots or upload them to a webpage or online auction quickly and easily, nothing beats a digital cam. The image quality of this Canon is acceptable if you understand that you will not be able to match 35mm film quality. The color saturation on the images is surprisingly good however you will notice some milky haze around some of the edges and background if you look closely. This is common (and expected) for low and mid range digital cameras such as this one. I bought this camera over the newer S230 model because of the price and the fact that the S230 has longer shutter lag. While the S230 has more megapixels, I wasn't willing to pay so much for images that would just end up being emailed and on webpages anyway. And the longer shutter lag in the S230 is unwelcomed. The image quality and 'look' is equal in both cameras as far as I can tell, of course the S230 model just makes them a bit larger. This camera is quite small, which makes it convenient to have with you all the time, or to put in your camera bag as an addition to other cameras. It only comes with an 8MB compactflash card. You will need another one. I recommend at least 128MB, which should give you 180 image capacity in the best picture quality mode with 'Super Fine' compression. The propriatary battery doesn't seem to last very long so it seems like an extra battery would be needed if you are going to rely on this camera a lot. But this will mean that you will have to carry around the extra battery, which adds a bit of inconvenience. All in all, Canon makes good digital point and shoot cameras for the money. The unit has a lot of features other manufacturers do not include (such as black and white and sepia modes as well as macro mode for close up photography) and it feels quite sturdy and designed well. It doesn't replace 35mm film cameras (nothing but the highest multi-thousand dollar digital cameras will), but for general snapshots and as a complement to your film cameras, this camera provides acceptable results.", "Date": "November 17, 2002"}, {"Title": "Best and smallest 2.0 megapixel Canon Powershot yet!", "Author": "vicvalv", "ReviewID": "R5CQZX79TBIA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This ultra-compact camera has excellent image quality in a tiny package.

The last vacation was the final straw ans total film costs for the vacation came to 60 bucks.  I did a lot of research and narrowed my choices to the S200,S330 and S3.  I looked at the S3 because I promised my wife that the new digital camera would take as good as a picture as the APS camera.  But the 3 meg pix was still kinda pricey so the S200 and S330 were the finalists.  The cameras from what I read are the same except for the 3X zoom on the S330. I didn't really use the zoom on my APS camera so we bought the S200 off of amazon.  Soon as ups came I started to charge the battery.  In the meantime I got familiar with the camera and read the docs.  Canon did a great job of a quick start guide and the detailed book was more than I really needed. about 1.5 hours later the green light came on from the battery charger (nice feature to let you know it's finished) and powered up the camera.  After setting the date and setting the pics to the highest resolution and super fine compression I was ready to go.  Point,shoot and view.  It was really that easy.  I was able to view the slide show of images I took and I erased the pics I didn't like (that pays for itself being able to erase the pics you do not want).  I also bought the viking 64 meg cf card and HP 100 Photo printer with this and I can't believe the photo quality coming from this little HP 100 printer.  The S200 takes as good if not better pics (settings are on high) than my APS and then the kicker was I pulled the CF card, inserted the CF card into the HP 100 (doesn't require a computer to print) and printed a 4X6 borderless pic in under 2.5 minutes.  We both laughed, cause you can't imagine the quality.  Side X Side with a APS photo you can't tell the differnce.  Took the little printer and S200 to work snapped some photos and printed them off and I get the same disbelief from everyone.PROS: small compact, rechargable battery, able to do video out to tv, usb to pc, incredible pics, no more film costs!CONS: got to get a 64+ meg card with purchase (8 meg card isn't enough)For [more money] get the HP 100 printer and you won't be disappointed...", "Date": "June 27, 2002"}, {"Title": "What a Sweetie-Pie!", "Author": "\"racantwell\"", "ReviewID": "R360E3UCO83BTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took me a long time to decide to \"go digital\" and even longer to figure out which specific camera to buy. I'm fairly techno-crippled (faxes and microwaves still seem like magic to me and I still have to rely on my children to program my VCR).  Because of my limitations I felt positively overwhelmed by the information to consider when I tried to pick which digital camera to buy.  I read as much technical information as I could stand (not very much) and listened to the advice of family and friends until my eyes glazed over.  Finally I decided to purchase this particular camera for several reasons.  First, Canon was a brand of camera I'd owned and liked in the past; second, this model seemed to deliver the most features at the lowest price; and finally it looks good and has a cute name (pause while eyes of the tecno-literate roll).The day after I got the camera I took it with me on a family vacation.  I started taking pictures almost right away -- although figuring out how to download the software onto my laptop took a bit of time and exploring all the things I can do with the pictures (like printing and emailing) is still in the works.  But I don't think any of this is a problem of the product -- everything in the documentation seems clear enough that even a moron like me ought to be able to put this together (eventually).Here are some of the things even I can do already -- 1)  I take pictures, choose which shots I don't like, delete them right away and take a new picture.  This is great if you have a nine-year old who loves to ham it up for photos (i.e., now mommy is going to take this picture again.  This time without the silly faces).  This is great for posed shots -- now you can be sure you got that great picture of your family in front of Cinderella's castle BEFORE you walk away.  2) I can hook up the camera to my computer, download pictures and enlarge them to see if I still like them (you can't see on the itty bitty screen on the camera if someone has thier eyes closed for example).  I delete pictures I don't like.  I may not be able to take a picture over at this point but I used to pay to have the shot developed only to throw the picture away later.  What a waste.  Plus now I only print the best of the best and only what I need.  3) I can (and do) carry the camera everywhere.  This camera is about the size of a double deck of cards.  It tucks in a pocket or purse (it even fit in my tiny evening bag along with my lipstick and credit card).  I found I was much more likely to take this little camera with me and got some great picures I might have missed otherwise. 4) I had no problems figuring out how to charge the battery, put the battery in the camera and load the flashcard (I did get the 128MB flashcard and never ran out of room).  It was a bit more difficult figuring out how to hook the camera to the computer and download the pictures but again, I think these are mostly my limitations not the product's or the documentation.Some disapointments, though not unexpected, were that it is hard to take \"action\" shots as there is a delay between pushing the button and taking the picture that is hard to get used to.  Also, sometimes I accidentally flipped the switch and was taking motion pictures instead of still pictures.  It was hard to figure out how to delete the motion pictures I did not want and I did miss the still photos I had wanted to take.It will probably be a few years before digital photography catches up to film photography in quality and at a price the average user can afford, but in the meantime this is a great camera to learn with while still capturing your memorable moments in photos.

The bottom line is that this camera will take great pictures in the auto mode if you want a point-and-click camera, and it has plenty of advanced features if you're a more experienced user.  Like any camera, however, you can't rely on the auto settings to get it right every time, so a little photography 101 homework is necessary.... The few negative comments (in my humble opinion) were mostly not THAT negative, or they were buyers who hadn't figured out the basics of digital photography. ...Asides from the excellent picture quality, you'll be pleased with the quality construction of the camera - all stainless steel except for the memory card and battery doors - not big deal, although it would of been nice to see it all stainless on the outside.  But rest assured, you won't find a camera built much better than this.  The feel/operation of the control buttons are that of precision manufacturing.  The LCD display is excellent, as is the menu set up.Some reviewers mentioned the need for a larger memory card than the suplied 8MB.  The 8MB card will hold only 7 shots on the highest quality / picture size setting, but I would only use that setting for printing or photo development. The camera takes very nice shots on the lowest quality/picture size setting,  which makes a approx. 79kb file - great for emailing...and you'll get 87 shots on the 8MB card!  You might find somewhere in between is best for you - you can always buy a larger card later.  Battery life isn't bad for moderate use - about an hour or so...it works for me, but a second battery for travel might be an idea (make sure you get the newer NB-1LH (840 mAh) battery that comes with the camera if you can). The supplied documentation is very good.  The movie setting, like most still cameras, is nothing to write home about.  It's good for a short \"merry Christmas\" to e-mail out.

If you don't think you'll take pictures in every day life, but just on vacation... or if you need to take pictures for work... you may find that size isn't key, and you may be happier with a larger camera (though I'd recommend other Canon models in that case, including the 330) or a cheaper one.However, if you're like me, and want to capture the world around you, but in good enough quality to get 8x10 prints of the *really* good ones... if you want to have a camera that fits in a pocket so you don't look like a tourist all the time... this camera merits a good look.When I say \"worth upgrading\": I loaned my S100 to a friend shortly before the S200 came out.  130 pictures/day later, my friend had to have one, so I took another look at the S110, which seemed a fine replacement -- and then the S200 came out, and I had to have it.Features that make the upgrade worth it:  video clips (long enough to be interesting; not only is this good for catching cats and trains, there are also cases where you can't get a clear still shot but someone looking later will get more out of a short video clip) *with* audio  better low light support (both automatic and manual settings down to ISO400)  anti-redeye flash option  ROTATION SENSOR (worth shouting about - it's so nice to just rotate the camera for framing, and have the results come out properly tagged.)  better (2- and 3-zone) autofocus/light level sensing  on-screen histogram for low-light shots (lets you tell if you really got nothing, or if you can pull out more detail in post processing)  \"view pictures\" mode lets you zoom all the way in, allowing spot checks for blurriness directly on the camera.

I really love this camera and have recommended it to my friends. The quality of the photos and its small size have won me over. The S200 has some of the improvements that I wish my S110 had but it is still a great camera. I have an extra battery but have only had to use it a couple of times. I charge my battery every day when I am travelling. The rechargeable battery is really a blessing. It is so convenient and quick to charge. Sometimes I wish it was a 3 or 4 megapixel camera but I'll have to wait for Canon to develop that in the future. I took the camera with me on my two plus week trip to France and took over 350 pics. That meant buying an additional 128mb card in addition to the 128,16,8 and 64 I already owned. It was barely enough. The camera worked well in low light situations(no flash used) when we wanted to photograph some of the paintings we saw on our museum tours. With a steady hand most came out pretty well considering the slow shutterspeed necessary for that kind of lighting. Where this camera mattered the most to me it through with flying colors on this trip and I was very happy with the photos of our trip. The primary reason to buy this camera is its small size and good quality photos. I carried this camera with me,usually in my pants pocket, 90% of the time I was in France. I barely knew it was there and I didn't stand out as a tourist.  I do find myself longing for a camera with more features and more megapixels but would I take it with me as much as I do now? I think not.  I do get a few unsatisfactory photos, but I think it has more to do with using the light well and setting the camera's light settings appropriately. I'm still learning how to use it.The video feature is really wonderful. It gives short clips with so-so resolution but you can be creative and catch some wonderful moments, especially with children.i would recommend the canon s30 or s40 if you can afford more and size is not a factor in your decision.

I have 3 main problems with the camera. #1- The Zoom. 2x zoom is just about like having no zoom at all. Forget the 2.5 digital zoom, it makes the pictures too fuzzy. #2- It has problems in low- light situations. I often have to use photo editing software to brighten up pictures. #3- The display is not very clear. For the same amount of money, I wish I had gone with the Fuji Finepix 2800. It has the 6x optical zoom with a much clearer display. With that said, it is a very small camera. Slip it in your pocket and no one has to know that you're a tourist. Also, the video with sound is very cool. With a 128 MB card and up you can store many video clips (up to 60 seconds per clip depending on what you're filming. Complex backgrounds such as trees will eat up the time quicker then if you were videoing sky). Also the software that comes with the Canon is very easy to use and the video software is neat too. I've heard people complain about the battery life but I took a whole weekend of videos and pictures with the display on without having to charge it. So it boils down to: if you're looking for the small size, go with the Canon.

It's our first digital camera, and we're basically \"point-and-shoot\" types.  So far we love it. The tiny size is a big plus as it easily fits in purse or pants pocket. It feels very solid and the controls are well laid out.  Even my wife (not technically inclined) finds the camera easy to use. It also has some neat features such the built-in automatic lens cover and automatically detecting whether you're taking portrait or landscape views and rotating the images internally.  It also has an amazing \"stitch\" feature which will combine several panorama photos taken end to end into one long image.  It automatically matches the edges!  It's slightly distorted, but still pretty neat.  How do they do that?  The way the menus are displayed on the LCD screen makes changing camera modes a breeze.  You can also upload pictures to your PC without pushing any buttons just by plugging it in!  The user manual seems well written considering the complexity of the subject.  Like others, I was disappointed that Cannon does not provide a case or larger CF card, but for the money the s200 still seems a good deal.  Our local 'big-box' store matched the best price I found on the internet.  The picture quality at high resolution is terrific. I view them on my 19\" PC monitor and they look very professional.  Even the medium res pictures look good.  Another unexpected plus was the included software.  I found it very easy to use and with plenty of features for a beginner.  The included ArcSoft PhotoImpression software does everything I want with a digital photograph including special effects editing, cropping, text layering, framing, making greeting cards and calendars, etc.  It simplifies placing multiple images or combinations on one page, which minimizes waste of pricey papers.  It also has a \"fantasy\" section that lets you create dummy magazine covers featuring faces from pictures you take.  Lot's of fun to play with, though I haven't fully explored it yet.  All told, we are very pleased and impressed with the camera.  While I'm sure other digital cameras provide many of the same features, Cannon's photographic reputation, other user reviews and the camera's small size ultimately sold me on this model.

Too many blurred and/or out of focus pictures. Had to sell off my S200 because it can't take sharp/crisp/clear pictures even in daylight ! Many other users on dpreview forums have same problems & Canon hasn't released any firmware update to fix it. My suggestion now is to avoid S200/S230/A40 because of focus problems. My old review continues below :Canon has another winner in its new S200 model just like the S110 and S100. It has the following positives,1. Excellent looks/build quality.2. Great night shots, not found on any other compact 6 oz. camera, new long shutter feature in manual mode for upto 15 secs (tripod a must for this).3. Very reliable and tons of features like charger works all over the world, PAL/NTSC video out, all cables included (unlike Sony).4. Accepts cheaper Compact Flash cards which are easily available in sizes upto 256MB. Not expensive 64MB sticks here :)5. Very much pocketable. Easily goes into any pocket.6. 2.1 MP may looks low compared to other 3/4 MP cameras but this one offers more features without sticking you with any sticks ! Don't just use MPixels as your sole criteria when selecting camera. If you won't print them bigger than 8x10\" then 2MP should be enough for now unless you have that extra cash :) Also Canon can't have a 3MP on the Elph's since they have to sell their S30/S40 also !7. 2x zoom very faster to start and fold back. Works smoothly. You can turn the digital zoom off permanently.8. LCD is superb, pictures look great on the 1.5\" LCD. (a bigger 1.8\" LCD on other need not neccessarily mean better quality, my last years Fuji had 1.8\" and comes no where near this 1.5\")10. I haven't encountered any problems downloading pics till now. I don't see any reason to buy a CF card reader, the included cable works fine took just 3 mins for 100 big pictures11. Comparing this with S330 is really very tough. S330 is heavy and feels rock solid, looks even better than S200 and has 3x zoom. S200 because of its light weight and smaller significantly smaller size is better to carry around. Play with both in your local store before deciding between the two.11. Great user interface... think of these Elph's as Nokia's of digicams. Other cheaper camera's out there might not have same reliability, features, user interface and picture quality.Things that could be better,1. Only 2x Zoom, Canon needs to get this up to 3x next year. (And 4x on S330's replacement).2. Battery... you might have to buy a second one for extra 45 bucks depending on your needs... I guess this is the case with any ultra compact camera3. The battery/CF doors feel flimsy.4. Canon's ZoomBrowser EX software is very unstable. It has crashed atleast 5 times in one week on Windows XP. also it takes long time to \"update its database\" whenever any pciture is deleted or addedd to the directory. Canon needs to iron out the problems in this. You may be better off using some other SW for editing/managing your pics, use this one just for downloading pics.5. Price is still high for a 2MP camera, although its become much more affordable than last year.6. Movie mode is almost useless because of 5 sec limit on decent sized clip. Its just a marketing thing.7. Included CF card is just 8MB ! Someone has to start including these necessary things like a decent 64MB card along with new cameras.8. Camera gets pretty hot in a few mins of use and the buttons on S200 feel tough to use compared to S330. This is part of the deal in buying a such compact camera.Spend few extra bucks on this cool camera and you won't regret !

I've managed to get some good pictures with it, but it definitely is not a good camera for someone looking for a \"point and shoot\" device. Careful composing of each shot is required, as is tinkering with the various settings and modes. For example, on my first outing, I took it to a large aquarium in Chattanooga. When I returned, I realized that only 1 out of the 16 shots I took was excellent; 2 other ones were pretty decent, and the rest were garbage. Not great for a supposedly \"point and shoot\" camera. On my second trip, I spent about an hour with the manual, learning the intricacies of auto focus lock, flash lock, various metering modes, and other features. If I spent a minute or so on each shot, carefully determining the best mode for the situation, my results were much better - 6 out of 8 shots were excellent. If you want a camera for a vacation where you want to snap something neat that you see as you pass by; say, out of a gondola, while on a train, etc - I'd say forget about the powershot s200.

I chose Amazon.com instead of buy.com for the uncomplicated return policy.The price is high for a 2MP camera, but I didn't want to spend $500 dollars for a 4MP camera. I rationalized by saying to myself if I don't buy another camera later, spending extra 50 to 100 dollars more is worth it.  2MP will serve my purpose as I am not going to print out posters from this camera. Besides, I don't have too much wall space to hang them. It is a size of a cigarette box, but as heavy as a unopened Budweiser can.  It would be nice if the camera came with a longer loop string to put around my neck rather than the small wrist loop.

It's really small, which is a huge plus.  Because of the small size, it's very convenient to take with you and that means you end up taking more pictures than you normally would.  I've chronicled most of the little and big events I have gone to with it.  Even though it's just 2 megapixels, that is more than adequate for me--I don't rely on it for professional shots, just mostly snapshots.  I have printed some photos through shutterfly, and they came out looking great.  You could tell that they weren't quite as sharp as those from a regular camera, but I had taken them at the medium compression setting.  They were definitely framable though and you probably couldn't tell that they were digicam pics unless you inspected them close up.  I suspect pics taken at superfine would be even better.  Rendition of colors is truly remarkable, and I have received many compliments from friends on this.  Canon sure does seems to know what they're doing when it comes to optics.  Any photos I've taken with bright colors (landscapes, flowers, etc.) came out breathtaking.  The camera is made of metal, so it has a nice, high quality \"heft\" to it.  The photo management software that it comes with is awesome--intuitive and easy to use.  It may run slow on old computers though, if you have a lot of photos in your albums.One complaint I have about the camera is that it's just okay in dark settings, even with the flash on.  Also, when taking pictures of people, I seem to get red-eye a lot, even with the red-eye reduction setting on.  It takes small video clips, but the resolution is very grainy and with the 64 MB card that I have in it, the maximum length of the clips is really short.Other than that, this is a terrific, dependable camera that's perfect for the beginning digicam user or for someone who wants the convenience of a small, easily transportable camera.  It comes with a far too small 8MB card, so I highly recommend getting a larger one.  Also, it doesn't come with a case, so I recommend buying one because this is a beautiful camera and you wouldn't want to damage it.

If you do not intend to make many 8x10 enlargements and none larger than 8x10 and you have a budget this is a great little camera.  The pictures at 4x6 size are as good as the S230.

There is a very minimal(2x) zoom.  2. There is not any warning before you run out of memory on your compact flash card.  3. There is insufficient warning before you run out of power.  4. There is an appearance of red eye in many indoor photos.These problems can be remedied by always starting out with adequate memory on your card, charging your battery before each use, carrying an additional battery and CF card, and turning off the flash whenever there is adequate light available.  This is often the case even indoors.  As for the zoom get closer. Do not use the digital zoom as picture quality suffers.I have discovered that by taking these precautions I've been very satisfied with both the S200 and the S230.

While small it is heavy for its size giving the impression of quality and durability.

There are times when I'm trying to snap a picture when the camera \"thinks\" for as much as 10 seconds before firing.  You can minimize this by pre-focusing the camera before taking the shot but this is not a good camers to try to grab a quick shot.A month after I got my Elph S200 the Elph S230 came out.

Metaxas", "ReviewID": "R3OVYWX2XZUTRX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I beg to differ with all the raving reviews.  There is something very wrong either with this camera's light metering in `auto' mode or its ability to register a wide range of tones - or both. It will work acceptably in diffused light, i.e. with an overcast sky.  But try to shoot people in bright sunlight and you get pictures that are far too contrasty: Eyebrows, nose and chin shadows come out far too pronounced. Things are worse if there is a somewhat light background, like lots of blue sky or any non-dark wall.  The system goes bezerk and yields pictures where the background is `burned out' while your darling spouse is a dark silhouette. The same happens if your son happens to wear a white T-shirt and you attempt to shoot a waist-up portrait: his face will come out underexposed.There are ways to overcome such problems (to a degree!): Switch to manual mode. But who really buys a point-and-shoot camera to fiddle with manual settings? If to get acceptable pictures I have to exercise `creative control' I might as well stick to my old Minolta Maxxum. The result will not only be acceptable but PERFECT pictures.But back to the S200 Elph. Another criticism is that parallax correction is way out: Unless you're shooting landscapes there's very little in common between what you see through the viewfinder and what the lens sees. Of course you can always discard that and compose through the camera's small LCD back panel - but try seeing anything clearly there in sunlight!Two minor negative points concern the flash (you get more `red eye' pictures than usual in point-and-shoot cameras) and the Elph's accompanying software. This is annoyingly basic. As an example, if you `correct' a picture's contrast (or colour or brightness) and save it over the original you lose all camera settings data (including date/time of shooting).Much has been said about the Elph's features. It is certainly impressive that so many are crammed in a camera this small. I am, however, unimpressed with the result.

It is a rock-solid, 2 megapixel, 2X optical zoom, pocketable digicam. It was not, however, a perfect camera, and the first update, the S110 attempted to address its major shortcomings, most significantly by fixing the poorly designed power switch and by adding a movie function. Next came the S200, which added to the movie function (60 seconds max., with sound) better battery management and higher amperage and several new user controls. It did *not* add the anticipated 3 megapixel resolution, nor improve upon the 2X optical zoom. The series continued with the S300 & now the S330, and these indeed do offer the 3X optical zoom (forget about digital zooms; they're nearly useless, especially in lower resolution cameras), though not the 3 megapixel resolution (this is important *only* if your intention is printing enlargements greater than 8\" x 10\"). So with all 5 of the digital Elphs still widely available, which would suit you best? Personally, considering their prices graduate only slowly, and given my experience that a better optical zoom makes for a more useful camera, I'd go for the ... S300. However, if size is not a major factor in your decision process, skip the premium one pays for the Elphs' compactness and consider the fact that you can buy other digicams that are only modestly larger but rather better equipped for less money.", "Date": "June 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "Rachael Moore", "Author": "Rachael S.

I print my photos through Apple's iPhoto (which imports well from the camera) and even after significant cropping, 4x6 photos are indistinguishable from 35mm photos.The video mode is impressive. This is a feature I didn't pay much attention to, but it really is a killer feature. I would never shlog around a video camera unless it was for special occasions where I knew there'd be lots to record. But with the PowerShot... it's small so you can take it everywhere... and it records great little videos ready for the web. Granted, its not as high of a resoulution as standard video, and the length is limited (a couple of minutes on a 128 MB CF card, but for capturing quick video (recently, of skier against a gorgeous mountain backdrop) it is priceless. QuickTime in Mac OS plays them flawlessly (even in the Finder under Mac OS X). The one caveat is not to film vertical orientation... because then there's no easy way to flip it. Did I mention it records sound?The preview mode is also good, smart enough to rotate pictures taken with a vertical orientation. And you can preview the movies (although without sound).Connecting to a Mac works well, either through the provided USB cable, or via Compact Flash card and adapter to a PC Card slot. The cable to connect to RCA input is pretty handy, as you can view pictures and video on a TV if your are away from a computer.Battery wise, there are some problems... after going through a 128 MB CF card of photos, you are going to have to recharge... that's my experience... also, there doesn't seem to be a battery indicator until you are out of power.Overall, a great investment!", "Date": "February 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "durable, go anywhere trooper", "Author": "jose_monkey_org \"jose_monkey_org\"", "ReviewID": "R350WG4I1VS4Y7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i've been using my s200 for a couple of years now, and it's toured the world with me. it's been durable, convenient, and a great home and road camera. i just got back from tokyo and took hundreds of photos and several minutes of video (30 second AVIs) with it. same with france, washington dc, and the like ...it's got good exposure detection, a very simple to use interface, and has the features i was looking for. the zoom is pretty good for most situations, and it's reasonably responsive (boot up time, delay between click and exposure). i'm not that thrilled with the macro capabilities, my nikon coolpix 800 did much better. nor am i thrilled about the \"no zoom during movie capture\" feature. overall, i'm quite happy with my s200 as a point-and-shoot camera. i'd definitely get it again if i had the choice to do over. however, now i'd probably go for a few more bells and whistles, including more optical zoom and better macro shots. still, can't beat the form factor!", "Date": "November 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great little digital cam!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2JK89H71AKDIE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband gave me this camera for Christmas, and so far I am thrilled.

You also will need to manually adjust the white balance with snow scenes as they will be a little overexposed on automatic.  Other than that, the only two reasons why I am thinking of upgrading are: 1) I want higher resolution for larger prints, and 2) a better zoom.  2x optical zoom (on any camera) is pretty worthless for getting action type shots in outdoor photography.

I have been a Canon fan since the late 60's, and although I have used pretty much every film format except 8x10, I have found that the smallest cameras were the ones that were at hand most often. My old Canon G17QL was my first \"small\" camera with a quality lens, and it still takes good images after 25 years or so. When the Elph APS series came out, I bought one, and I was hooked. It offered far more than the typical point and shoot camera of the day, and sported a great lens protection system, as well as an armored metal body. I carried it in my pocket for several years, and it always gave great results. The only problem was the continuing expense of film. I dreamed of the day when digital technology caught up with film. The wait is over. The S-200 has the diminutive size of the APS Elph cameras, as well as the pocket proof lens protection. It is also all but bulletproof with it's tough stainles steel body. This camera is loaded with quality features. With a 128 meg memory card...it is ready to take 128 gorgeous max resolution pics. The color, exposure, and overall quality of the pictures will amaze you. Even the short movie clips the camera can take are of high quality, and have wonderful sound.There are larger cameras that have similar features for somewhat less money. There are also larger cameras that cost more than the Elph. With the exception of the 4 megapixel S-400 though, I can't think of any that offer better image quality and features in as small and durable a package. Even then, the S-400 costs much more. If the S-200 takes a trip over Niagra falls, it is a lot easier to deal with. I just ordered the new S-400 Elph to satisfy my incurable desire for leading edge photographic toys. It is a little heavier than the S-200, but has all of the latest refinements, including an extended movie mode. It also costs $... Even after it arrives, my S-200 will still be the camera that is always in my pocket, ready to go at a moments notice. Consider this; After eight months of constant abuse (just stuffed into any convenient pocket with keys, dirt, whatever, on a daily basis), it doesn't show any signs of wear. Plastic cameras simply can't compete. The lens door is so well made that despite it's working environment, I have never had dirt penetrate to the lens surface. After taking well over 2,000 photographs, it performs like new, and delivers high quality SLR class images. It makes better 5x7 images than many larger 3 megapixel cameras, and delivers solid 8x10 performance. If you have a computer, you can enjoy and manipulate all of your work without spending a fortune on processing fees.Last, and most important, is the simple truth that this camera is so small and tough that you will carry it with you with no more fuss than a ring of keys. After all, the best SLR in the world is useles if it is sitting at home when a photographic opportunity pops up in front of you. If you can only justify one digital camera for all of your family photographic needs, get the S-200. You will be amazed. If you can justify as many cameras as you would like, get the S-200 or the S-400. I bet it will become your most often used camera.Update (3/23/03). When I ordered the S-400, I also ordered a 24x 250mb Compact Flash card. The 24x refers to how fast the card can store an image. It also determines how fast you can take another picture. I bought this card for the S-400, but the card arrived first, so I tried it in my S-200. At the time the S-200 was made, 128 meg was the largest card available, and I wasn't sure if a larger card would work properly. The results were fantastic. The S-200 had no problem recognizing the 250mb card right out of the box. The 24x write speed makes taking sequential photos without flash seem like a motor drive was installed (sequential flash photo speed is limited by flash recharge time on any camera). Best of all, the S-200 with the 256mb memory card will take over 250 (that's right, 250!) max resolution photos without having to download or carry a spare memory card. That could well be an entire vacations' worth of pictures in the palm of your hand.The price of the S-200 has dropped since I bought it. The cost of high speed 256mb Compact flash memory today is about what I paid for the 128mb card when I bought the camera. This makes the combination an even better value than before. If cash is no problem, buy the S-400. It is simply awesome with the quantity of up to date features packed into the tiny steel case, but if you prefer an album full of beautiful 5x7 or 8x10 prints from an inexpensive pocket dynamo, but this combination. You won't regret it. By the way, there are many brands of Compact Flash memory available, and several offer high speed. The brand I bought was Lexar. I'm sure others will work just fine, but Lexar offered the fastest (24x) at the time, and I know it works with the Canon line. They also include a USB adapter with the 256mb card, so if you don't happen to have a CF card reader built into your PC or laptop, you can download your images to any computer with a USB port without special software or cables. A nice touch if you are away from home and want to email your pictures from a library or internet cafe.", "Date": "March 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "What a camera!", "Author": "Wen Xue", "ReviewID": "R3D53N38MCZPQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a couple of digital cameras in the past.

The S200 gave me everything I was looking for, and more. As for the reviewer below complaining about poor picture quality - you can examine each picture the second after you shoot it, and delete it if it's not a quality shot. If you choose to keep poorly shot images, rather than deleting them, that's not the camera's fault. It's yours. The menu is easy to navigate, in general. If you choose to be really technical and explore every bit of the menu, that may be a different story. I use the menu to adjust general image quality and things of that nature, and I find it to be very intuitive. One other recommendation I'd have is to purchase a larger memory card if you plan to use the camera on vacations. I bought a 256M card and that's actually overkill, but rather too much space than not enough. I also purchased an extra battery so that I could have a spare ready to go when the other is depleted. I'm sure these two extras have greatly improved my experience with this camera. I would certainly buy it again in a second.

Due to its metal frame, it's slightly on the heavy side for its size.It's the type of camera you can take with you just about anywhere. It's perfect for taking to partys and other events as it can take a real beating without getting hurt.2MP is good enough for most occations, and you can make very high quality prints in the sizes you're used to for your APS and 35mm cameras.The AF Assist lamp is a definite advantage, as it allows you to take pictures in relatively low light, usually indoors. It sometimes happens that it can't lock focus, but the camera will still take a picture after a short pause, and usually with a good result at that. This feature is far from perfect, but it definitely gives you an edge over cameras that lack this small, but very important feature.The battery capacity is not that great. With the LCD screen on, you can perhaps get somewhere between 50-120 pictures taken, all depending on how much you're \"idling\" in between. An extra battery is a must here. I shoot most of my pictures with the LCD screen off, and on that setting, the camera will still show you the resulting picture in the LCD screen for either 2 or 10 seconds (user selectable), so it's not really a problem. With the LCD screen off, you probably about double the amount of pictures you can take, possibly more, before you have to change the battery.On maximum quality settings, your pictures will usually consume between 700kb and 1.1MB of space on your memory card.

What sold me on this Canon S200 was the quality of the pictures, the built in features ( flash, zoom, rechargable lithium-ion battery), the reliabity of the camera based on previous owners reviews, the portability or its small size, and the fact that Canon used a metal enclosure when most of the other cameras did not.So my reviews after a year of using it is as follows:  The camera is great, the lense allows for clear, sharp pictures. Even 8 x 10's look great. The computer software is very good and easy to use. This camera is also very reliable. I have used it for over a year with no problems at all. Also, I have dropped the camera accidently twice. Once on a hardwood floor from a height of about four feet and the hinge hook on the inside of the door for the memory card broke. I used a piece of transparent tape to hold the door to keep it closed and then ordered the replacement door on the phone for $8 directly from Canon. That drop did not effect the camera at all otherwise.  Then recently the camera accidently dropped out of my aftermarket velcro belt case from about three feet up onto solid concrete. It landed on a corner with a solid \"thump\" and the lithium battery popped out.  I was sure the camera had to be damaged !  I picked it up and the outside metal case didn't even have a dent in it, only a tiny scratch on the corner where it landed against the ground. I put the battery back in and turned on the camera and to my surprise everything worked perfectly. This seemed impossible to me but I took a few pictures checked the lense and its motors. The pictures were all there in memory without a glitch. A three foot drop onto solid concrete and nothing but a tiny scratch ?Hats off to Canon for making one durable little camera.  I don't know what metal they used to encase this thing but after my two accidental drops I would not recommend anyone buying one of these expensive digital cameras without a sturdy metal casing.  I do not recommend doing this but I have also read several other reviews people accidently dropping this camera into water without effecting it. These Canon Powershots cost more than many others with similar specifications but the others are not as durable nor do they all have the same quality lensing.

I print on a color printer and send images to Shutterfly, and both methods result in the same washed out look to the contrasting elements (trees, houses, hair, etc) against the sky. With a deep blue sky, no problem. Also, I use a 256MB card.

The cons of it are:-Terrible shots at night (when it needs flash)  If you want to go to nightclubs and take shots, or take shots at night, you are limited to 6feet distance.  The good cameras for night shots are the Nikons and Olympus.-The video mode will only goes to 30 seconds maximum.  It should go to as long as the memory card allows, but it doesnt.  For that feature get the Canon A60.-Only 2x Optical zoom, digital zoom should not be used with any camera.-The picture quality is not as good as it should be at the lower pixels levels such as 800x600.  But a plus is when you shoot at higher pixel levels.  But at that level all digital cameras shine.But on the positive side:+Small(its really compact)!!!!  I take it everywhere.  I took it to me when i go places where i 'should not' be going, and it was so small i had no problem taking it out, shooting a picture, and putting it away in my pocket (pant pocket, or jacket pocket, or even shirt pocket) and no one was the wiser.  Its really useful when shoping and i need to take pictures in the store of merchandise.  Most stores(especially Frys, Walmart, etc) dont allow that but its so small the stores dont even notice.  All in all for the price premium, if you can wait till better small cameras come out, or if you have to buy a compact camera now, this is an average quality compact camera.

The Canon S200 consistently received excellent reviews on numerous sites with many positive comments on compactness, picture quality, and overall design.  Of course there was always the ocassional negative review from someone who got the rare lemon but the majority rules. This is a great point and shoot camera with a crisp view screen. It also gives you the ability to tinker with plenty of the settings including shutter speed. It does an outstanding job with two mega pixels, any more for me would be overkill.  I have taken photos in numerous lighting situations and it has done a good job in all of them, including a gorgeous macro shot of a flower. I purchased the leather S200 Power Shot case that fastens to your belt and you would never know it's there, it can't get any easier.  With a 128mb card in the camera and an extra battery in my pocket I'm ready for anything.  The movie mode with sound works great and is easy to send by email(great for new baby clips, etc.). There are three resolution settings for the movie mode: 4,10, and 30 seconds in length with the 10 second setting being my favorite. I have read complaints on the duration of the movie but for email it's plenty long enough unless you like huge uploads and your family and friends like huge downloads. Try holding a camera on most people for 10 seconds asking them to say something and it seems like an eternity.  A nifty charger is included which is very compact with it's own pop out plug, just plug it in to the outlet like a glade air freshener and wait for the light to turn green. I have noted some complaints that the camera doesn't warn you of low battery soon enough, how much time do you need?  When the indicator comes on you have a few shots left but why push the envelope, just swap batteries.  When is the last time your car warned you of an up coming dead battery?, at least the S200 doesn't leave you stranded and the battery is so small you wouldn't even know there is an extra in your pocket. The S200 will plug in to your TV and do an awesome slide show of any or all of the pictures and movies contained in it.  It shows a few pictures, automatically plays a movie, then shows more pictures and continues this in whatever order you choose with a staggering amount of pictures and movie clips using a 128mb card.

One trick I found to get good all-around pictures is to put it on manual mode with \"flash-enabled\" at all times.  This gives you good pictures indoors as well as outdoors in most situations, especially backlit ones.  Also, pictures with the flash have less shadows on the faces.On my recent vacation I used the Canon s200 almost exclusively since it is so portable. You can slip it in your pocket and have it ready in no time. Besides, it is unobstrusive, and you don't go around looking like a tourist with a big bulky bag.  You can also print out pictures with the Canon CP-100 Digital Printer, which is a small portable dye-sublimination printer (not inkjet, so it won't smudge).  It's a great combo to take on vacation or to a party since you can print out pictures right there and share with friends and relatives.Another neat feature is the stitch-assist mode.  You take a series of pictures, by looking through the LCD, it'll show your previous picture half-way and helps you to line up the image.  You can then import this sequence into the Photostitch software provided and get an instant panoramic.  The Canon Photo Browser software remembers which set of pictures were shot in a series, and the transfer and stitching is very easy and automatic with a few clicks.  This feature is great for vacationers and real estate agents, and adds to the fun of using this camera.  The resulting image is likely to be huge, but using any photo editing software you can reduce the size for web-pages (set the width to 800 pixels) and create some really awesome vacation web pages.Another fun feature is the movie clips you can take.  It's very simple to use.  Just slide it to movie mode, push once on the shutter-release to start taking the movie, and once to end it.  Surprisingly it even records sound, so you can get the kids to say Happy Birthday to their grandma and send it to her via e-mail.For convenient show and tell, Canon includes a cord that allows you to connect the camera to a TV (and there is both a video and an audio cable - for the sound in the avi (movie) mode).", "Date": "March 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excelent digital Camera", "Author": "Evelio Martinez Mtz \"eveliux\"", "ReviewID": "R2OZ2K964LFOFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An excellent digital camera, great price, less than $300; very compact, fits in your pocket.

I highly reccomend this camera to anyone who is interested in a digital camera without all the bells and whistles!", "Date": "July 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Cool cam - cheap price", "Author": "SysAdmin-E dot com", "ReviewID": "RWSUX805VRTD0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are way too many cameras in this category that you could spend months researching them all and you'll probably still be unsure that you made the right choice. The S200 was one of my picks and the fact the my brother has the older S300 and really likes it made my decision to get the S200 easier. Amazon also has the best price when you include the free shipping. I bought this along with the Viking 128 MB card. Below are the pluses and minuses that I've classified thus far:+ Compact size and solid Japanese construction+ Featured-packed with many manually adjustable features that I don't plan on ever using+ Comes with rechargeable lithium ion battery and charger (this will save you around $50)+ Records video and audio and has A/V outputs so you can plug it directly into your TV to view the pics and video+ Nice packaging and excellent documentation - you get the actual paper manuals, not PDF files on CD. Everything in the box is well layed out+ Sharp LCD screen+ Excellent picture quality- Lack of a case or protective cover of any kind- Flimsy terminal cover on camera- Pathetically small 8 MB CF card that was included- Unlike some other brands, namely Olympus, your PC will not recognize the camera as a mass storage device, so depending on your version of Windows, you'll need to either install Canon's software and/or drivers. I personally don't like installing software on my PC just to be able to download the pics off the cameral. I'm not into touching up pictures, so all I want to do is plug the camera in and drag the JPG files from the camera to my PC's hard drive without going through some custom program; you cannot do that with this camera unless you have Windows XP or ME, according to the manual.Things you should get along with the camera are: a case, larger capacity CF card, and a CF card reader so you don't wear down the camera downloading pics to your PC. I don't think an extra battery is something that you should get right off the bat because it's expensive and, unless you plan to take pics all day, would not be necessary. The included battery should be adequate as long as you're not using the flash and LCD with every pic. If you do plan to get a battery, I've learned from postings elsewhere that you need to make sure that the battery has the same V and mAh ratings as the stock battery. The third party batteries might state that they are compatible, which is entirely true, but they have lower power ratings than the original Canon battery. You'll be able to use them, but they will not last as long as the original Canon battery.Overall, I think I made the right decision with this one. It's not the best camera out there, but for $, I doubt you'll find anything of this quality that comes with rechargeable batteries and charger. Most pics that I've taken came out fine. Some pics with flash look grainy while others with flash look great - I'll have to take more pics and experiment.", "Date": "July 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2R0DS5E1SPX8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is very easy to use.

I had a chance to compare this camera to Sony CD mavica 300, which we owned but its bulky. The picture quality...mmm.. the quality is good but i still like the quality of the Sony MVC 300 (using 2 megapixel), maybe this is due to the \"Carl Zeiss\" lens. I took about 250 pics(10 days), my only complaint was that i been getting some kind of \"snowflakes or \"spotting\" on my pics, about 1/3 of my pics have this. I'm not really sure whats wrong with it. First i thought there might be some kind condensation on the camera or in the lens but couldn't find the culprit. i also notice that the \"snowflakes\" or \"spotting\" only appears on a telephoto and dark shots.i'll be returning and exchanging this camera for a new one, i'll give it another try.

This is a 2 megapixel camera, which was the mean for a compact camera about 2 years ago (when I bought the camera).2) This rating is based on 2 years of wonderful experience with this camera and thousands of pictures taken.  If you are set on a 2 megapixel camera regardless of price, then this is the camera for you.  -Picture Quality- Amazing for a 2 megapixel camera.  I routinely print out 4x6 pictures at great quality.  Before this camera I was using an APS Elph.  Without a doubt this camera prints much better quality pictures than my old APS compact camera.  Although keep in mind, no matter how good the camera is, the prints can only be as good as the printer.  The only problem I had with this camera is that it is VERY dependent on the flash for point and shoot pictures.  Without the flash, unless you are in bright sunlight, pictures can come out blurry if you don't have steady hands.-Features- AMAZING.  Simply more features than you will use if you are buying the camera for quick snapshots.  Also the problem with the flash dependence that I mentioned earlier can be fixed using the manual features.  But with that said, it is impractical to change these features manually everytime you want to take a quick shot, but it is very handy when you want to take portrait type or studio type shots. This camera also has a movie function with sound that most cameras have nowadays.  Most people say they don't use it, but I use the function a lot.  I find the main problem is that most people just forget they have the function so it is never used, but if you can get in the habit of using it you'll have priceless small clips (at a low resolution) of things that happened.A 2x optical zoom isn't too shabby either considering many compact cameras don't offer a zoom.-Durability- again AMAZING.  I have never dropped this camera (well once off a bed, onto some really soft carpet), but I've owned this for 2 years and probably 75% of those two years that camera has resided in my jeans pocket with lint, keys, cell phones, change... and not even ONE scratch and it still works perfectly.  I did buy a small pouch for it, but the pouch really goes against what this camera is about, fast pictures.  It wasn't practical to take the camera out of the pouch everytime I wanted a quick picture so I never used it, and it turns out I never needed it.Also the camera is heavy and solid for its size.  Too heavy for a shirt pocket, but definitely light enough to put into your pants.  Its made of a metallic material that feels much better than the plastic that most compact cameras are made of.The display screen on the back of the camera is plenty big enough to use to frame your shots.  The viewfinder however does not accurately show the picture you are taking, which is a problem for many cameras.  I never use the viewfinder because of this, but I never really want to either unless I forgot to charge my battery and I want to conserve battery power... which leads me to...-Battery Life-  The battery easily lasts the whole day of picture taking if you are on a vacation for instance.  Easily I would be able to take 100+ pictures with flash and the screen on.  But I have noticed over the thousands of pictures I have taken that the constant recharging of my battery has made the life lessen a bit.  But that is to be expected from any battery over a couple of years of high usage.-Price and Summary- I think the deciding factor for this camera is price.  I gave this camera five stars because I couldn't be happier with my camera... BUT i bought the camera 2 years ago.  A quick look at cameras of equivalent price and one can easily find 3-4 megapixel cameras for the same price (but maybe not the same quality).  A quick look at cheaper cameras and I can also find plenty of 2 megapixel cameras from reputable brands such as Minolta, Nikon and Fuji.  This camera has kept its price amazingly well over 2 years for an electronic device (I bought mine 2 years ago for $250).  I think it has to do with the HIGH quality of this product.  But if you have the extra $$$ for a mere $100 more you can get a 4 megapixel Elph.I am very satisfied with this product and I know when I eventually get a new camera several years from now it will be another Canon Elph.", "Date": "May 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great for a Trip", "Author": "Frank L.

Can it really take pictures? - looks more like a toy. Then you look at the user's manual and you are amazed by its thickness - all this for a point & shoot camera? As you read through it you find it hard to comprehend that so many features are included in such a small package - technology has certainly progressed!And then you take your first picture. It's not good, so you take a second, then a third, then you fill the weak 8mb flash card supplied with the Elph with test pictures. None of them are good. They're either out of focus, or too contrasty, or the background has been `washed out'. Almost all are badly framed too. What gives? So you go back to the user's manual and re-read and start trying different settings, combinations and shooting techniques. Eventually you manage to produce a really nice picture. Then you realize you have *worked* for it.The S200 Elph has wrongly been touted as an entry-level camera. Its picture quality in auto-mode-point-and-shoot is nothing to write home about. Lens flare is way, way pronounced (cheap optics, in plain English). To get good photos you have to plan and compose carefully. Which, in my mind, defeats the purpose of going for this camera. It is supposed to be *practical*. Size aside, it's no more practical than all digital cameras. You shoot, you download, there's the picture. They all do that, and it's the reason we have come to love them. Doesn't mean we have to have bad photos.There are other gripes, many pointed out even in the positive reviews: problematic flash, shutter lag, no camera case, no battery life indicator, inadequate zoom factor, weak software. But all these pale into insignificance compared to the main problem: Picture quality. This is so essential, I don't see why we should even bother with other shortcomings. After all we take pictures because we expect them to come out beautiful, don't we? I do. If you think like me, pass on the Elph. If, on the other hand, the beauty of the camera is important, get the Elph. It's small and techno-loaded, it's shiny and oh-so-cute. It delivers big in the `cool' category.
