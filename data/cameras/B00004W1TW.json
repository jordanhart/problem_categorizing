I was originally looking for the Cannon Ixus, but this was smaller, very light-weight, and had a 4.3 million pixel definition!  The advantage of this is that you do not need to zoom with the camera.  It will allow for a 2400x1800 resolution, so you can zoom in on a quarter of an A4 sized picture with the software whilst hardly losing picture quality.  The Quicktime movie mode works well and is fun showing a webcam like video with sound.  Finally, it is an MP3 player which is hardly bigger than the dedicated ones.  Sound is good, the MP3 player alone is worth having, allowing you to do voice recording and pictures when necessary.  Oh, it also looks very cool!  Only drawbacks that I've seen so far are no onboard memory and the MP3 player doesn't take VBR encoded files.  I say nevermind!", "Date": "September 27, 2000"}, {"Title": "Finepix 40i.

Well all that doesn't matter. This baby rocks.First off I had no problems with mp3's, I got mine ... and stuck 'em in the 40i and off I went. NO PROBS!!This camera is tiny, it's light and it a joy to hold and use. The quality of the pictures are amazing, I took a shot of the sky just before sunset and the detail in the clouds is unreal.The 16MB supplied card is a bone of contention for me. Yes it will store 19 or so max resolution pics. But compact flash would have been the way to go Mr Fuji.The smartmedia is ok but it's wafer thin, looks like it could easily break with removing it all the time to go in a card reader and the industry seems to support the bigger CF cards. So why not Fuji?I reckon a 64meg card would give you almost 80 pics at the max setting. Maybe enough for a holiday/vacation hmmm maybe.....I did print out some pics first at max setting, then at norm setting and I couldn't tell the difference - even at 10 by 8 size so maybe a 64 meg card would do it.Anyway, this is the camera for me, I don't buy things unless I am totally happy with them and I am totally happy with this purchase.", "Date": "November 18, 2000"}, {"Title": "perfect balance", "Author": "Allison A", "ReviewID": "R33T267CGBLE8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the perfect balance between high resolution and small size. The photo's I have taken with this camera are so fantastic, that two other picky people from my office finally bit the bullet and bought one too! I have traveled the world for 13 years capturing the moment - therefore -my photo's are important to me. By the same token, if the thing is too large, I am less likely to want to drag it along. This camera is so small, I carry it with me everywhere - traveling or not. It is also easy to use with auto or manual functions if you prefer. The macro lens is great - I have used it in lieu of a document scanner in a pinch. I carry a couple of spare rechargeable batteries (extra 5 bucks) so I am never out of juice and the smart media cards are only limited by MB = hundreds of pictures on one card. Another important consideration is the time it takes the camera to record the shot. Some digitals have more megapixels but are too slow to record initially or between shots. This one is as fast as a film camera. To sum it up - this camera takes beautiful pictures, is easy to operate, fast to act, and small enough to carry in a pocket while skiing. Top this off with ?Ofoto? (Amazon's photo printing service) and the results are amazing - worth framing. If this baby ever dies--> I will buy another one!The digital video is fun for short takes with sight and sound that can be replayed on the camera. I have never used the MP3 function and I do not care if I ever do.Best of luck on your camera hunt.

Not only does it play MP3's and take great hi-res pictures, but it also takes digital video with sound, which you can review instantly on the LCD screen on the back of the camera. The 40i is easy to use, the smart card media cards hold tons of pictures and the whole thing easily fits in my pocket! (It's about the size of a wallet). I have used the 40i to send pictures and videos of my baby to my family in Texas and Atlanta and they are always amazed by the quality. If you are considering getting this or the Canon Elph, get the Fuji 40i.

The quality is great and in such a small , light but durable package! Megapixel !!!! I can't say enough about this camera. So many features. I do use the mp3 player and it works great , but to hold pics and mp3's I have to upgrade my smart media card. I will go to a 128 meg and that will be all I need. (I called Fuji and they said it will handle a 128 meg card) This camera requires a special ID smart media card and Viking makes it. Last time I looked Amazon was selling it [price] dollars for 128 meg. Nice! My wife has her eye on this beauty and now she wants one, so I ordered the metallic blue model. The movie function is nice and includes sound but I really don't use it. I noticed that although the movies have an .avi extension windows media player won't play them but quicktime does. .... Some camera buffs wish this camera had optical zoom, but I'm happy with the digital zoom and after all optical zoom means heavy weight added to the camera.

The camera cannot do the zooming-in for you.And secondly, the shutter speed is far too slow.  Trust me, you cannot take photos of, say, people dancing.  All you'll get is a blur.Oh, and why Fuji neglected to include the AC Adapter as part of the package is beyond me.  Supplying two rechargeable batteries, which take about 13 hours to charge simply isn't on...That aside, it is a good little camera.  TV-Out is more of a gimmic than something you'll use regularly, as the pictures look very fuzzy, even on a decent TV.

The major advantages for me have been it's size, picture quality and, of course, the very handy digital video recording functions. I would definately recommend it to friends because, in my opinion, it's the best all round performer. OK, with that out of the way, I have one major problem with the video function: Having used the camera on a regular basis, I've found myself recording more and more videos. I now have 2 64meg cards to support my habit. The videos are saved as .avi files which I thought would be ideal to send to friends to view the videos. Unfortunately, if the video is double clicked on a standard Windows PC it does not act as a standard .avi file and it cannot be viewed ie it can only be viewed either from within the Exif Viewer software (supplied with the camera) or by opening Quicktime then opening the file itelf. I'm happy to be proved wrong on this. I've tried renaming the file to .mov so that it can be recognised by Quicktime and I've also tried changing the file associations in Explorer so that the file is viewed by the standard .avi viewing software. When the file is double-clicked in Explorer a connection to the net is made to attempt to download the appropriate decompressor (which, of course, fails). My suggestion is simple - if the file generated is indeed given a .avi extension, can it be viewed as any other .avi please? I'm sure that there's a very good reason why this occurs but try explaining it to the average Joe who tries to view the video without Exif Viewer or Quicktime.", "Date": "March 14, 2001"}, {"Title": "After a year of ownership....", "Author": "B Zolt \"bzolt\"", "ReviewID": "R1D9THJ8D43VDS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a year of owning this camera I have to say I am still pleased with it. It has been the ultimate device to have for traveling & vacation, especially when visiting museums where you can use all the functions - still camera, video, and MP3 player.Those who wrote less than favorable reviews, seemed to have higher expectations of this camera than what was advertised. If you want to take professional quality photos, have lots of little buttons and settings on the camera to play around with, and be able to zoom in on distant subjects, then just buy a digital camera that has those features. Or those who expect more from the MP3 player, like ID3 tag support and being able to fast forward through songs, should just buy an MP3 player that has these options. After a year of using this camera I found I don't care about ID3 tags.I think the only legitimate complaint people should be posting are about it's reliability problems.
