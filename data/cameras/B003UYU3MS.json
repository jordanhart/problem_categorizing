{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not perfect, but close enough", "Author": "Harry M. Shin", "ReviewID": "R3VN74Y5NO2C0T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "1.  There's a lot of personal biases that go into determining as to whether one likes or dislikes a camera, especially with compact cameras.. because we tend to want it to do everything.2.  Brief background info:  I've a lot of different cameras over the years (film for many years (contax / zeiss, some nikon), various sony digital cameras (F828, R1, HX5v?), Olympus gear (E5, EP-1), brief encounters with the Pentax K5 / Canon 5DII / Sony 850 / Panasonic LX-3 etc... etc...  Oh yea, and I've owned the Ricoh GX100 and 200 but sold them a while ago.  Both were excellent cameras in that they were relatively small (compact but not subcompact), they had an excellent focal length range (at least for me), excellent imaging (shooting RAW)... but only at base ISO, decent performance in re: continuous shooting, nice lens accessories, superb build and ergonomics and an excellent menu system.  Basically, the GX100 / 200 were cameras designed for \"real\" photographers.  The only downside was that the \"high\" ISO performance was absolutely hideous, esp with the GX200 (ie higher MP camera).  ISO 400 was essentially unusable for me.  ISO issues are important because with a compact camera, the concept (at least to a degree) is that you want to take it with you in various places (where you wouldn't take a bigger camera), you're going to be shooting in varied conditions.. and often times want or need to use ISOs at 400 or even 800;  the GX100 / 200 made this essentially impossible and thus I got fed up and just sold the unit, hoping for something better.  Reality: there is no perfect camera for all situations.  I'm very happy with the Olympus EP-1;  excellent imaging qualities and decent ISO performance;  400-800 is easily acceptable;  1600 is a stretch.  But, although smaller than a DSLR, it's not compact;  even the current versions are only semi-compact if you use a pancake lens;  if you use a zoom, it's definitely not compact and they don't make a zoom with the nice focal length range of 24-70mm (if / when that comes out--> again, not compact).  I also thought the sony HX5v would be nice;  good on paper--> terrible in realworld imaging.  I mean, plastic / artificial JPEG images for the masses (no offense to anyone out there who likes the HX5V).3.  Thus, in the end, if the main thing that counts is image quality, the GXR is definitely a camera system to consider.  Here are my brief pros / cons of this unit with the 24-70mm lens:  a.  Pro & Con:  The camera is semi-compact; smaller than the m4/3 cameras, but not by much, at least with the pancake lens.  But it's definitely compact considering you have the versatility of the 24-72mm lens.  On the otherhand, it is overtly bigger (not by much, but noticable) than the GX100 / 200;  too bad, because I really like the size of the GX100/200.  This camera is not a pocketable camera ( at least in one's jeans; it'll fit into a jacket pocket or large pockets in one's cargo type pants).  In the end, you'll have to figure our what your priorities are but with my recent negative experience with the Sony HX5v, there's no point in having a very compact camera if it's difficult to use & outputs lousy images...  b.  Pro: build quality.  All of the other main stream camera companies really should take a cue from Ricoh;  this is how to build a camera.  Very well made, solid, excellent ergonomics.  c.  Pro: menu system and customization.  Again, all of the other camera companies should treat or assume their customers are intelligent photographers.  If you know what you're doing, you're going to love this camera;  it just offers a lot of flexibility and customization.  d.  Pro:  Imaging.  I was initially dubious as to the different between this new lens module compared to the GX100/200, simply because the lens is the same.  However, after some research, the sensor & / or engine is different and it shows.  ISOs of 400-800 are useable and acceptable;  it's still noisy and thus one may choose to utilize a light amount of their favorite noise reduction software, but compared to the GX100/200, this GXR with the new 24-72mm is definitely much much better in regards ISO performance.  Again, it's all relative;  compared to the m/43 it's more noisy, but then the m4/3 is more noisy compared to the Pentax K5 compared to the Sony 850.  Bottomline, in most applications, you can actually use ISOs of 400-800 with this camera.  In terms of other imaging issues, as with the GX100/200, the GXR provides excellent imaging.  Nice colors (natural), sharp images, decent dynamic range... basically it provides nice / natural looking files from which one can then create excellent images (ie I use a RAW workflow and thus I'm not talking about JPEGs).  e.  Neutral: performance-wise, the camera is good enough.  I wish the continuous shooting was faster than what it is (you'll have to look up the specs, but I think it's around 1.5 frames / sec and then stops at 5 images).  Focus speed is ok.  Again, overall good enough performance.  f.  Neutral or Con:  Movie Mode:  I'm a photographer and thus really not that focused on movies.  On the otherhand, I live in the modern world and it would be nice to have at least 720HD video, but in the end, still imaging is the most important thing to me.  With that being said, the regular movie mode is good enough for me, if / when I just want to document something.  When I think about it, I have HD video (720) on my EP-1 / E-5 and I had true HD video (1080) with the Sony HX5v and in all cases, I intermittently used video and I have never ever processed / edited that video footage.  Bottomline, unless you actively shoot video and edit your video footage, don't let this \"spec\" hold you back from this camera.4.  There might be more to say, but I've overextended myself.  There are a lot of decent cameras out there, but the Ricoh is definitely one those cameras (and company) that always gets overlooked by the mainstream;  it is what it is.  If you're someone who doesn't care about the hype but cares about quality, then this is definitely a camera to seriously consider.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful pics", "Author": "E Soon", "ReviewID": "R1X4U95AXAJPET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lots of contrast, colour rendition was amazing. Bought the zoom kit and later the 28mm lens and sensor. Was hoping to get the M sensor and use other lenses but realised that these days, my eyes aren't that good and having to put on reading glasses and manual focus is just one too many things to do when composing a shot. For travel, I sorely missed the smaller size, weight and portability of my GRD1. Although the pics from the GXR are better than that from the small sensor GRD, (tho some pics of my GRD were good enough for publication in magazines) so I think I will look forward to getting a GRD V (for walking around the city) and keep the GXR for still life or landscapes.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "c A 'Delicious' Camera (Ricoh GXR)", "Author": "MAXWELL STRICKMAN", "ReviewID": "RX45S66BFWHLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Because my Ricoh Digital Camera (GXR) is one of the most enjoyable instruments that I have ever owned, I term my camera as 'Delicious.'
