It's 3 cables, with shielding and exposed wire strands.  It's actually for a DVR system.  I found that out after I tried to crimp on end on.  I was only able to to use a single pair for a single phone line so it worked, but I was not what I wanted.  The description does make note that its for DVR systems, but never clearly says how many wires it has.  I gave it one star not because of the quality or even the lack of wire description but just to get the attention of anyone who might be considering it for landlines.  For DVR systems it probably works fine, seems like a good quality cable.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what we needed.", "Author": "Peavy", "ReviewID": "R2S27ZSHVGA9NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We needed some additional length of cable for our cameras and they show great picture with this additional RJ12 cable.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect for my application", "Author": "RenoRed", "ReviewID": "R14FZY2ZHY14KJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just what you need for those long Revo video camera runs to the far ends of your home or business.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Revo Video Cable", "Author": "Louis Vaccaro \"Curtain Shop dot com\"", "ReviewID": "R3089IC3OXN5B0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Needed a few extra feet (about 80!) of cable for the Revo camera system and this did the trick.

Recommend T59 Wire/Cable Fastening Gun for stapling wire onto both interior and exterior walls. Also, there are various sizes of insulted fasteners/staples that can be used to secure the wire without damage.

Revo has a serious problem in that their cameras often require a double female connector between the cable end and camera.  I have now gone through at least 10 of these connectors.  Not from mis-use, but exposure to the elements make them die a very sudden death.  The electrical connections in the ones I have committed to the grave yard for expensive toys, have completely dissolved.  They just don't exist any more.  I had three of these do that within the first two months that I owned the new Revo DVR system.  I have told Revo of this and they declined to send me any replacements.

My security systems wire looks exactly identical to this wire in both looks and despription but unfortunately I needed RJ11 wire.  This wire is RJ12, but how does one know theres a difference without an explination.  Suffice it to say I feel for the better price and bought 2 of these.  Amazons return policy is absolutely horrible by the way.  By the time you pay to ship and have the 20% restocking free reduced from your original order, you'll be lucky to get back half of what you ordered.  And price pros that sells this wire isn't fun to deal with.  I returned my wire via postal instead of ups, and it sent them for such a loop it took an additional 3 weeks to get my refund.
