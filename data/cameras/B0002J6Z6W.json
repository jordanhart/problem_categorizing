KIM \"mom2sarah\"", "ReviewID": "R2N13D3CXULU4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this AWESOME ultracompact digital camera from my local camera store.  I am by no means a novice to the world of digital photography.  I bought my 1st digital camera (Nikon Coolpix 990) over 4 years ago for just under a thousand dollars. While it took great pictures, it was too bulky and a bit too easy to change the settings on the camera.  My 2nd digital camera was a SONY Mavica-that one had TERRIBLE photo quality.  My 3rd camera was the Canon S50 which is very highly rated butI had 3 problems with it- 1. It was too bulky to toss into my pocket. 2. The toggle switches are a pain to operate  (they eliminated them for the S60/70) 3. I was not blown away by the photo quality. To be honest, I think my Nikon Coolpix took better  indoor pictures and it only had 3 (vs 5) mega-pixels!  I have heard that Nikon utilizes some of the best photo lenses in the industry which result in great-looking pictures.  I was thinking about getting the Nikon Coolpix 3200 BUT the shutter speed is way too slow!  And it has a cheap, plastic body.  Then I read Mossberg's review of the Dimage X50 in the Wall Street Journal and was very intrigued.  So, I headed to my local camera store and purchased it (they have a 7 day return/exchange policy).  I took a bunch of pictures of my baby both indoors and out, and I was VERY IMPRESSED with the photo quality (for a camera this tiny)*.UPDATE:*Some reviewers complained about \"noisy\" pictures.  You have to factor that in when considering a digital camera purchase.  If you want pictures with no noise, then you have to use a much bigger camera like the Canon A95 or Sony W1.  Also, I don;t recommend buying an ultracompact camera as your primary or sole camera.  They are best for taking to parties or tossing them in your bag to capture spontaneous life moments. You shouldn't expect an ultacompact to produce museum quality pictures- it's simply not possible.  I truly believe that the XS50 offers one of the best photo quality in the arena of ultracompacts.Besides the high photo quality, there is A LOT I love about my 4th digital camera.  1st, the price is GREAT esp. when you consider the picture quality, TINY size, and zoom capability.  I think it's a STEAL! 2nd, the only thing I disagree with Mossberg is that he didn't think it looked very \"sleek\".  I love the all metal design - aside from the viewfinder, you will not find any cheap plastic parts.  Even the A/V out has a tiny metal door that slides up and down.  Not to be anti-American made but it's obvious that this was made in Japan.  It is also extremely EASY to use-the buttons are very intuitive.  I have yet to crack open the manual.  It also makes a soothing \"ding\" sound when the picture is in focus (not at all loud or annoying) so that you are assured a great picture!  Even though it is very small, the lay-out is great and NO TOGGLE SWITCHES.  And of course, having a  2\" LCD monitor is very helpful (and fun).  You don't have to squint into a tiny viewfinder!  The combined 12x zoom is VERY COOL-it's similsr to a submarine telescope and doesn't protude !The only thing I'm not crazy about is that it uses a proprietary battery but it's supposed to last for over a 150 pictures and using \"AA\" batteries would have added too much bulk.  Overall,I am THRILLED with this camera!  I finally got (almost) EVERYTHING I was looking for in an ultracompact digital camera- Very Good photo quality, ease of use, tiny size, and a very FAST SHUTTER SPEED at a great price.  What more can you want?  Well, maybe a bigger memory card :-)", "Date": "September 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for everyday use!", "Author": "Leslie S.", "ReviewID": "R1MUCP3D89QA5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched cameras for about 2 months before finally deciding on the DiMage X50.  I went to a camera store to check them out and found that the camera I really wanted hasn't been invented yet. (I wanted a large LCD screen (2-2.5 inch), and more than 3X zoom, and all in an ultra compact camera!)  It all came down to the Dimage X50 but I also looked at the Casio Exilim EX-Z55 which had a nice 2.5 inch LCD (but you need a dock to connect to a computer), and the Canon SD300. The viewfinder on the Canon was in the middle of the camera and was uncomfortable, as it hit my nose. (and I must say I have a small nose!)  The DiMage X50 came the closest to meeting all my needs.  I also liked the non protruding zoom lens and the metal cover that protects the lens and also acts to turn the camera on and off.My criteria was: a small camera I can keep in my purse, large LCD screen, optical viewfinder, fast startup and no/short lag time between pictures, USB connection to computer and connection to TV, movie with sound ability, easy to use, good picture quality, zoom (could be better - although you can zoom in on pictures using photo software).I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  I was very surprised when I took my first pictures in a dark restaurant.  The couple sitting across from us came out clear and without red eye!!  The camera is very easy to use.  I was taking pictures and movies before I even read the instructions, which I eventually did to find out how to use the camera correctly.  The pictures indoors as well as outdoors came out great.  Downloading them onto the computer was very fast and easy.I've been keeping the camera in an eyeglass case (men's vertical type) with no problem.  It's easy to carry in my purse without worrying that it will be damaged.  I did order the Minolta casual case for it and will see which works better when I receive the case.I can definitely recommend this camera with no hesitation!!", "Date": "November 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great take-along camera with AWESOME close-ups!", "Author": "Artem Lapitski", "ReviewID": "RHY18I7PDSLOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera during my trip to St Thomas in the Virgin Islands after my old Panasonic DMC-LC43 got washed down by a wave at the ocean. The main reason I bought it was the design and the super micro mode which lets me take extreme close ups (see my pic of a bee in the images section). Since almost all of my pictures are taken outdoors, the noise in dark pictures is not a factor; when I do take dark shots, I set the ISO to 50 and that gets rid of nearly all noise.Pros:-Sleek and small design-Great for close-ups-Customizable sounds (menu clicks, shutter, focus)-Slideshow function-WEBCAM function with decent quality video-Good quality video recording for the full card capacity-Good battery life-Lots of modes (sunset, landscape, portrait, etc)-Very quick start-up time...moreCons:-Slight noise in dark pictures at auto ISO-The internal zoom lens is a little loud and sometimes gets stuck for a split second in the middle of the 'zooming' (while the button is pressed). This started about a week after I bought it. Works but sounds as if it's about to break every time it reaches the max/min zoom point.-Battery door is a lil wobbly.Got it for $300 at the duty-free store + an extra battery and case at a discount, so I consider it a great cam for the money.

I had only owned one camera before this, a Canon S110, so comparisions will be relative to the S110.It is very small and light (slightly smaller and lighter than the S110) and it starts up very quickly (much faster than the S110).  Daytime picture quality is very good (comparable to the S110 except with higher resolution).  Night/dark area pictures are terrible due to the noise (the S110 does better).  I expected better since the S110 is a much older camera model.Like B. Hart's review on May 13, 2005, I also had problems with the LCD screen.  Unlike Hart, I did not drop my camera.  It just stopped working at one point.  After taking a picture outside a castle in Japan, I went into the castle to take more pictures.  5 minutes later in the castle, I slided the lens cover open and the LCD displayed all white.  The LCD had become stuck at ultra high brightness.  I couldn't see a thing with the LCD (no viewing pictures already taken, etc) and it drained the batteries real fast.It has been 2 months since I sent it in for repairs as covered by warranty.  They said they'll replace the LCD.  I also find the repair turn around unacceptable.Some notes:  My S110 has a \"Made in Japan\" label, whereas my X50 has a \"Made in Malaysia\" label.  My brother's X50, which he bought in Japan, has a \"Made in Korea\" label.  His camera has no problems whatsoever.  I had originally assumed my X50 was also made in Japan until it broke.  I was looking for the SN and noticed the Malaysia label.  I'd definately be more careful next time in checking the made in labels before I buy.", "Date": "May 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "The perfect ultracompact", "Author": "amazonlink", "ReviewID": "RSPZ5159JK9UB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I put some time into finding a good digital camera. Many people I meet at parties and social events pay a lot for bad quality name brand cameras that boast portability and style (ie, sony, canon's sd series), and I checked out most of these ultracompact cameras suggested to me. Most of them to be honest (maybe with the exception of the canon sd300) just didn't do it for me. I finally came across the dimage x50. This camera is UNDERRATED; the image quality is excellent, it has the flexibility to become a point-and-shoot camera or a manually adjustable camera, the color saturation is the best I've seen from cameras this small, and you can also have the option of recording captions to remind yourself why you took the picture or what it's about.I was looking at the canon sd300 and sony t1, very small cameras with power and many features, and I guess the deciding factor for me in going with the Dimage was that 1) its lens is non-protruding, unlike the Canon series. I've worked in electronic stores, and trust me--cameras frequently come in because the zoom lens won't function. 2) I think the overall quality is the best, not just due to higher MP, but just because the camera distinguishes colors a lot better than most other cameras and the final product (sans red-eye, blur--unlike the sony) is perfect.Finally, this camera has a cheaper price compared to other cameras in its class.Hope this review is helpful.", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice package, noisy images", "Author": "Overzeetop", "ReviewID": "R2K16LPI1APOJY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is one cool camera...it has all the buzzwords and is -physically - a dream. I wish I had known that the images would not quite be up to snuff. Before you disregard my post as flamebait or trolling by a camera snob, let me say that my last digital camera - which has very good image quality - was a $199 Fuji Finepix 1.3MP bought 4 years ago.The images are quite noisy in low contrast areas, especially in indoor lighting conditions.  The only way to mitigate the problem is to manually set the ISO to its lowest value - 50 - which will cause a lot of flash work on a camera with an f/5 telephoto lens. At the lowest setting, however, the pictures seem very nice. Although this workaround does allow it to produce acceptable images, you'll need to be more interested in the \"coolness\" of this super-mini camera to feel that its worth $350.I have a post over at steve's digicams forums which shows the noise problem.

However, I dropped the camera and even though there was no visible damage to the body the LCD screen was damaged internally with an odd shaped section of about half the pixels blank.I sent the camera in to Minolta warranty repair and it seems that to repair it they had to order a new LCD screen component from Japan.  I've now been waiting 5 weeks (not including shipping time) for my camera.  I find it totally unacceptable that the repair turn around is so slow.  This is a current model with probably hundreds of thousands being shipped so why can't they have spare parts on hand in the US.

Overall speaking, it is superior to Sony P8 in terms of image sharpness, design, weight and LCD size. However, I found that the LCD display is not as good as that of sony's. Sometimes the display of LCD will simply blur and you cannot see what is going on there esp. when you zoom in or zoom out. Another problem with it is that the LCD is sort of fragile and tends to be easily broken (I wish that is only my guess). Since nothing is perfect, you have to ask yourself what is the most significant factor that you are looking for in any kinda Digital Cameras. For me, of course, it is the image quality and portability. Hence, the Ultra compact minolta X50 is a must keep for me. I have done a lot of research before I made this purchase, all the candidates I once looked at were Sony T-1, Canon SD300, Casio ex-x55. After a elaborate comparison and field test, I prefer this x50 for its best performance in image capture and also for its elegant design.

After using the camera only 6 months, the LCD screen displayed a red line and then days later multiple colored lines, rendering the screen useless.  After not receiving contact from the repair center for over a month, I contacted them.  Their response was the infamous \"impact damage\" which was not covered by the warranty and the repair cost was their infamous $148.  I talked with numerous customer (dis)service representatives and managers in an effort to determine how impact damage can happen during just normal usage.

However, for a 5.1mp camera, it really fell short, especially in low light situations.  Not to mention when using the flash.  You better be ready to blind the subjects you're taking a picture of, because you have to be pretty darn close or you'll lose the shot to fuzz, blurr, or whatever else.Anyway, I'm thinking of buying the X60 model since it looks like you get more for less.  My only concern, Costco no longer carries any of the Konica Minolta line.  Neither does BestBuy.

I think this has to do with the camera's size and intrinsic frailness if it is not assembled right. So, be sure you buy it someplace that will replace it or refund your money, so you will have recourse if you have this experience.With that caveat, I have to say that I am impressed very much with this sporty little camera. And it IS sporty. I've taken it out and not missed those interesting city street scenes I've always wanted to capture, when before I had been really frustrated by my slow and bulky fully manual camera. It's not just a point and shoot. It's a really fun camera to take out on the town and catch action shots with. That's not to say it doesn't have features that go beyond point and shoot that a lot of people just don't want to learn about or practice getting right It's not fully manual, OK, but I already have one of those and it is too bulky to take into the city and take great and interesting pictures of street scenes. This is the intended purpose for the X50 IMO.I had a Minolta G530, but I dropped it in some coffee and I've been without a small camera for a while. At first, I thought the G530 was better than the X50, but I am coming around to thinking the X50 will be just as good once I get better at quickly working some of the controls that are a layer or two down. The bright idea of Minolta, though, was to give you the ability to bring the function you think will be the most important for the current shooting situation to the first level of control. If you are in changing light with bright sun alternating with thick clouds, then bring the exposure compensation up to the first layer of control. You can do this with ISO sensitivity, quality settings (i.e., fine, normal, etc.) white balance, exposure compensation, metering mode, color mode, and the ability to change the 2\" LCD's brightness.  It takes excellent outdoors night shots, and I plan on taking it out with a tripod this weekend to see what it can really do with the 2.8 zoom. under city lights It seems like not much, but I think it will be able to use some of the digital zoom with the tripod. I will give my report afterwards.  (I know, what's the point of a small camera if you are going to use a tripod? The thing is, I have a half size tripod that I can collapse and carry in a backpack, or even in my jacket pocket.)  I will also take some shots without the tripod.  I've already done this with great results.As far as overall picture quality goes, it is quite good if you keep the ISO down. I have heard that if you make prints up to 8X10 they come out really well. On the computer screen, I have noticed a little noise, but it is almost not noticeable. There was no noise at all with the night shots.It also has some presets, but the only one I have used so far is the macro.I can only tell you my experience with the battery. I took it for a 4-hour walk yesterday and took about 100 shots on a 1-gig card. I had the power save on 1 min and the camera shut itself down dutifully and powered back up as soon as I touched the shutter button. I used the LCD for every shot and I still had some juice in the battery when I got home, although not much. Even so, I would recommend an extra battery, since you can't always be sure you will start out with a full charge on the one you have loaded into the camera. The battery charger is actually about the same size of the camera, so it would be no problem to carry it a jacket pocket if you were staying at a hotel, or visiting someone. It also has a changeable cable for the outlet, so when you travel to a foreign county, you can just pick up a local cord there.The internal zoom is a good feature too. Makes it faster to get it up and running - remember, I said \"sporty.\" There is another advantage to this, which is there is no external barrel to worry about. It also makes the camera that much sexier.I give it a 5,because I really like its smallness, which makes it quick with the ability to get those street scenes you would miss otherwise. If you want to use it for your kid's birthday party, then buy something else. You'll have to really work at overcoming the problems this camera has with contrasts with indoor scenes, like a boy or girl about to blow out the candles on the birthday cake in a low lit room. Size and sportiness might get you noticed by the other moms and dads there, but it's the pictures you really should care about - so buy a camera that is made for those situations. There are plenty of good ones to choose from.That's my take on the X50.

However, I have read that Konica Minolta has left the digital camera business, and this makes the X50 even more valuable to me.The camera has a superfast startup which occurs by simply sliding the lens cover open.  Honestly, the X50 is ready to shoot in less than 3 seconds.  I currently have four digital cameras and have probably owned twelve digicams over the last seven years, and none of them start as fast as the X50.Another plus is the compact size of the X50.  I carry this camera with me whenever I drive, as it fits neatly in my carry bag with my cell phone, medicines, and other essentials.  For me, this is a very important feature, because you can't take pictures if you don't have your camera, and you never know when you'll see something that might turn into a good picture. It also fits neatly into any available pocket, and the zoom lens is unique because it is non-protruding.The X50 has most of the features digicam users have come to expect: large LCD, numerous special picture settings, 3X optical zoom.  It also has a optical viewfinder, which can be useful in brightly lit outside situations.  By the way, in my opinion the X50 also takes great pictures.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the price", "Author": "Magpie", "ReviewID": "R26E12DJWMQ0EE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent almost 2 months searching the internet for a camera, when a friend recommened Konica Minolta. They had previously bought another model and loved it. I looked on the Minolta sight and saw this camera. However, I looked at the price range, and it was very far out of my budget. This seemed like the ideal camera for me, except for the price. It was small and very travel-friendly. I scanned ebay, and I found a great deal, for $100, new! I was delighted, and when it came, I tested it out, and it was perfect. I love this camera because of the size, the picture quality, and it's EXCELLET super macro mode. I had high expectations, and it met all of them. The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the internal optical zoom is a bit loud, and the battery life is questionable. But so far this has been a great camera for a beginner, like me, and I highly recommend it. If you are thinking of buying this camera, I would recommend you by a protective case for traveling and a screen protector.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "I LOVE it!", "Author": "Movie and Music lover!", "ReviewID": "R16H4NAC196W0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first digital camera have ever owned.

The reason I say unpredictable, because when it comes to taking pictures with the zoom and or the flash feature, you never know what you will get. I'm a modest with digital cameras and photography but still, when I use the zoom, 6 out of 10 pics come out so extremely fuzzy I end up deleting them. This goes for the so call \"macro\" feature as well, which was the main reason I needed the camera in the first place. The flash is so unreliable even in the proper background. I waste too much precious time having to fiddle and praying the pic comes out ok, due to the poor focus lens. This brings me to say, I also think the response time is too slow when trying to get a quick shot. You would think for all the features the camera offers the response would be a little faster. I think partly because it has such a poor focus lens that it takes precious time trying to - focus. By the time it \"clicks\" it's too late and yet it still comes out fuzzy.The worse part, I bought the camera exactly a year ago and in Jan/2006 I had to send it away while it was still under warranty because the display just went out on me without warning, and for no reason. I take very good care of all my electronics, so I'm perplexed.However, out of fairness I could say it can be a fairly decent camera if you have patience and no high expectations. I do like the video feature, it did come in handy a few times, but don't rely on the zoom in feature on that either, even just one notch of zoom, you never know what you might get.", "Date": "March 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Takes great pictures but don't drop it", "Author": "Ballet4me", "ReviewID": "R2OMFG5YBGKZHH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera barely a month ago.
