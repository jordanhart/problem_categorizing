{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lumix is the camera of the year!", "Author": "Michael Stouffer", "ReviewID": "R9VCEBHJPF0AU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For $599, this is an unbelievable camera for an aspiring amateur or blooming professional. I was looking for something better than the average point and shoot but not as complicated as the digital SLR's. I wanted a nice optical zoom, not just some 3x optical with 4x digital.I researched camera after camera for over a month. I looked at basically every camera out there including the newest and higher end cameras such as the Canon Powershot G6, Canon Powershot Pro1, Canon Digital Rebel SLR, Kodak DX7590, Nikon 8700, Olympus C-8080 and the Sony F828 among others. After much debate, it came down to the Canon Powershot Pro1 and the Panasonic Lumix FZ20. I didn't mind paying more for the Canon if it was really worth it, but I could not turn my attention away from the Lumix.It had a much better optical zoom -- an unbelievable 12x!!! The higher end cameras only went to 8X (Canon Pro1) or 10x. Although I wanted a 6 - 8 megapixel, and the Canon had 8, I figured that I'd rarely blow up my images greater than 8 x 10, so when would I really need such high pixel resolution. See, in my research I found out that pixels aren't everything, believe it or not. It depends on what you're going to do with the images. If you just want to send e-mails, you only need a 3 megapixel. If you want to print out quality pics, you might go for a 4 or 5. You only need a high megapixel camera if you're going to do some really big layout stuff. For me, that wasn't the case and the only other thing I liked more about the Canon was the swivel screen. So I went with the Lumix.After you hold this thing and take pics, you'll think this is an 8 megapixel!! The images are so sharp and clear it is unbelievable. I was told in reviews that I'd see some redeye in the pics, so just to be safe I purchased an external flash (yes, the camera has a hot shoe). The best part is, I took off the external flash and tried it with the standard pop-up flash and still -- NO RED EYE. I was amazed.The menu is easy yet there are tons of options. The unit feels and shoots like a professional camera, yet with the ease of use for an aspiring amateur. I am SO VERY HAPPY that I purchased this camera. Do not pass it up. I'm telling you, if you want something affordable and better than the average compact point and shoot -- this is the way to go. If you're looking for small size, then go with something else. This is a big boy, but not extremely heavy or bulky by any means (like the F828). It just won't fit in your pocket.Before you buy, I suggest you go to Circuit City and play with it. See how it feels. Don't just go in blind. In purchasing your next camera, really see which models out there have what you need. Every camera has its pros and cons. I have yet to see the flaws in this baby, but it may not be for you. Do your research. A great site to compare and see the newest reviews on the best cameras is [...] It really has some great info.Good luck on finding your new camera. My vote goes to the Lumix FZ20 -- ALL THE WAY!", "Date": "September 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "LOVE this camera...", "Author": "Zeolite", "ReviewID": "R1VQ75XM1A4HZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One complaint that I have about this camera is that the LCD screen cannot be moved for taking pictures at odd angles, or to protect the screen when you are done. Overall, it's a great camera. One of the lesser-known but very unique features of this camera is that it can maintain an F-stop of 2.8 throughout the entire zoom range. Most zoom lenses must reduce the aperture size, letting in less light, at full zoom. The top-notch Leica lens on this camera allows you to maintain the maximum aperture setting at full zoom, allowing you to use the zoom effectively in low light settings.Here's my list of accessories that you may want to purchase in addition to this camera:1. Bigger memory card (comes w/ 16MB SD card). If you want to take a series of photos in rapid succession (using the \"burst\" mode), a high speed (Ultra II) SD card works better. Otherwise, a regular SD card is fine. Also, several smaller memory cards may be safer, and cheaper, than one large memory card, in case a card goes bad.2. Camera case. I just bought the Tamrac 5683. The fit inside is snug, but with a little room for a lens-extension. It's not quite the smallest bag for this camera, but it's very sturdy, waterproof and has a good deal of padding. It also has just enough room in the side pocket for extra cards and cables.3. NC (no coating) or MC (multi-coated) clear filter. This is a filter that you can attach and leave on at all times to protect the lens. In order to use a filter, you must attach a lens hood. The camera comes with a hood that requires 72mm filters. You can also purchase a hood (e.g., made by Photosolve, Pemaraal, or Raynox) that fits 62mm filters. Why would you purchase a 62mm hood? Several reasons. First, 72mm filters are more expensive. Second, the 62mm hood is shorter and smaller than the Panasonic 72mm hood. Lastly, I don't think the Panasonic 72mm filter lets you cover it with a lens cap, though I'm not sure.4. 62mm lens cap (for the filter in #3).5. AC adaptor to power the camera directly. The camera does not come with this, but you might find it convenient to have.6. Extra battery. The battery charge lasts for quite a while, but it never hurts to have a backup. CGA-S002 is the part number.7. USB card reader for SD cards. The camera comes with a USB cable to transfer your pictures from the memory card to a computer. However, a USB card reader can be useful if you want to download pictures without turning on your camera.8. LCD screen protectors (look for PDA screen protectors at an office supply store, and cut to size).Finally, if you buy accessories online, just make sure you find a good price, because the online stores that sell really cheap cameras tend to overcharge for the accessories.After owning this camera for a year and a half, I have more reservations about it. If I could, I would change the rating to three stars.  I have found it difficult to get a sharp focus, and also difficult to get a clear image indoors. Granted, indoor shots have less lighting, so require a longer shutter speed with greater risk of blurring, but it is still frustrating to see only one picture in ten come out clearly, even with the motion stabilization.  Turning up the ISO to 400 helps, but results in noisiness that I find unacceptable, so I rarely go beyond ISO 100.  Also, this isn't the greatest camera for taking quick shots.  The focusing speed, and picture-taking speed are frustratingly slow.  If you want to get that perfect facial expression on your toddler at just the moment you see it, another camera will probably serve better.  Granted, these are some of the prices you pay for a more complex camera with a higher-end lens (as opposed to a point-and-shoot).  Also, don't mistake this for a full DSLR.  My friend's Minolta DSLR focuses in a split second with a satisfying click of the lens body.  The Lumix sometimes focuses over more than a second, going in and out of focus until it tries, and sometimes fails, to find the focus (again, in lower light conditions).My wife now wants me to buy a Canon powershot. She gets frustrated with the Lumix because she can't figure out how to adjust all the right settings, and it looks like I'll have to give in on this one.", "Date": "November 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "A Digital SLR trapped in a non-SLR Body - Great Product", "Author": "B. Colonna", "ReviewID": "R1MG7JGDPH10JO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is fantastic.  It has a superior lens.  The zoom is great and basically, the camera could be considered \"the poor man's answer to a digital SLR\".  Except it isn't an SLR.  The lens, made of very high quality by Lecia, is fixed mount.  You can't remove it, but it has an incredible zoom of up to about 430mm.  This makes it much more than a point and shoot, and gives you the flexibility of higher priced SLRs.Overall, this camera has numerous features!!! Easy to use controls, great battery life.  The camera is much larger than a point and shoot so know that going in.  The battery is a Panasonic unit, not AA or AAA, so it will cost a bit to replace.  It comes with the camera, along with an easy to use, compact charger.Photo quality - great!  For best results (lower noise) I set the ISO to 80 when possible.  You can shoot at F2.8 throughout the zoom range (even Panasonic's new 8MP Lumix doesn't offer that, dropping to 3.7 toward the longer range).You can shoot fully programmed or go manual if you are a camera buff.  You can use all the modes in between - shutter preferred, apeture preferred, etc.About all you give up versus a $1500-$2000 SLR is the ability to change lenses and a slightly lower shutter (some Canon SLRs fire at 1/8000 second).  This camera also has a smaller CCD sensor than some of the Canons, but again - the Panasonic is less than $500.  The CCD is what makes the photo quality on any digital cam, in the end.  ISO can be set to auto, or from 80-400.Stabilizer - helps keep shots sharp throughout a long focal length.  You have two options for stablizing photos.  One is throughtout the focus and one is at the time of the photo.  I set mine for just the time of the photo and feel that provides better results for sports photos (soceer, lacrosse).Bracketing - lets you bracket exposures, which works great when you are shooting on the beach, for example.  You have sun off the water, or maybe behind your subject, so you can bracket the exposures automatically and shoot 3 shots with one click, so you get an over/normal/under exposure and one should be a great shot!  This also helps with pictures of kids, as you essentially get a few different facial expressions (the bracket shots are after all in succession, not the same exact instant).You can also set the camera to fire off multiple shots on one click of the shutter (bursts) and get 10-20 shots in rapid fire, capturing that one or two \"perfect\" photos.  In addition there is a flip animation feature, which lets you create nice \"flip page\" features of your kids, pets, etc.You have a decent flip up flash as well as a hot shoe for an external flash.The camera has a built in video cam - just keep in mind that it locks the lens on whatever focal length you are at when you go to video mode, so this is not really for anything other than basic video.The camera also has full audio, so you can record sound and/or add narration to your photos to refer to later.Other features include numerous metering options, an auto focus \"assist lamp\" for low light, and histogram options.  It even has several settings like \"sports/snow/fireworks\" and so on, so you can choose one of those for different photo scenarios.  i've tried them all and they don't hurt the photos, although I'm not sure they enhance any given photo scenario.  But I tend to chose my own shutter and other settings, shooting manually much of the time.  if you prefer to shoot in auto mode, I doubt you'll be unhappy.This camera is a must own for a family.  It gives you great shots of the kids.The included software works fine, so this camera easily connects and works on your PC.The two downsides:The lens cap is not clip on, so you might lose it.  I use the included lens hood almost all the time so I don't worry too much about the cap.  The other downside - you need a good memory card to use any 5 megapixel camera - Panasonic includes only a 16mb.  You want at least 256mb, preferably 512mb and up.  if you are going to shoot at lot of bursts, get a high speed, quality card.", "Date": "October 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best Camera Ever Made", "Author": "Alan D. Hewitt \"Don't Call Me Al\"", "ReviewID": "R1BAVE496KBM0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Lumix DMC FZ20 is, arguably, the best camera ever designed and produced.  It is, most definitely, the very best camera I have ever used and I have been taking and making pictures professionally and for fun for 50 years, starting with a Yashica-Mat (2 1/4 sq. TLR), light meter and flashbulbs and lately, with three other digital cameras.  I was skeptical of the hype produced about the camera but its appearance, alone, is sexy.  It's the Darth Vader of cameras.  So I took a chance and made the purchase, thinking that something had to be wrong or missing for a camera with those specs for only [$...].  Wow, was I wrong.  As soon as I opened the box and got it in my hands, I knew what love at first sight really meant.  Every control falls under the right fingers.  The Lumix must have been designed by a working photographer and not an engineer.  Every feature is superior quality, such as the LCD monitor, the viewfinder, the unbelievable 12x optical zoom, all of the manual overrides that are available, the plethora of shooting modes, and, most especially, that hunk of glass called a lens.  That lens proves that it takes more than a lot of pixels to take a good digital picture.  That lens lets all of the juicy colors get through to the pixels.  That lens lets razor sharp images through to the pixels.  That lens alone is worth the price of the whole camera.  Everything came together when I made my first prints from the Lumix: up to 13x19 enlargements that were so crisp you could hear the snap, crackle and pop; Colors that were perfectly faithful to the original scenes; and cropping that represented half of the 'negative' before I could discern a single pixel.  I could go on and on but life is too short and I have a lot of pictures to make.

I have taken thousands of pictures with them, so I can give you a good assessment of what you should expect. Since I've sold these, I upgraded to a Rebel XT, so I can also tell you how they compare.Interesting thing about the model is that, for various reasons, it has a very very loyal and almost cult-like following who make this camera sound like it's made by God himself. FZ20 is not \"all that\" as people here there and everywhere will tell you. It is just a very decent prosumer-grade camera.That said, I would recommend this over Canon S2IS (although comparable in image quality, feels like a toy over this one), and the Sony DSC-H1 (just not as polished enough as a serious camera). Yes, I have had a decent amount of experience using both of these other cameras.Many people will tell you that this camera can produce images so good that you won't be able tell the difference between it and one from a more expensive dSLR. This is only half-correct. Let me tell you that even with the mediocre kit-lens of the Canon Rebel XT (which you all know is the low-end model dSLR), you will be able to tell the difference when compared side-by-side. Better contrast, color balance, sharpness, just more lively and \"better-looking.\" On the other hand, if you just show the picture from an FZ20 and tell them that it's from a Canon 5D, you can probably fool most people (including me). But then again, I am very confident that I can take a picture with my Canon A620 and do the same.I seem to be too much on the negative here, so let me compensate for my 4-stars. With good lighting, this camera can produce some very impressive images, and the zoom reach is just awesome. If you haven't had experience with ultra-zooms, you will appreciate how it opens up another world of opportunities in your composition. I would go out to the street, sit on a bench, start shooting away at people without them noticing me at all... resulting in people looking very natural, not looking into the camera and smiling.Let me close by noting a very very important difference between these two cameras. The FZ20 is a \"daylight\" camera. If you need to take pictures over ISO80 (on the FZ20), you WILL DEFINITELY be able to tell the difference between the image it produces and one a Rebel XT would produce under the same ISO. ISO400 shots on this camera is, I am sorry, HORRENDOUS. That's right. HORRENDOUS. You cannot use it. This means that if you use it in auto setting in a semi-dark place (even inside of a decently lit building), you will get a bad image. If you set the ISO low and lower the speed to compensate, you will get a blurred image - if not from your handshake (please, the IS is good, but it doesn't do magic), then from your subject moving. The Rebel XT, set your ISO up to 800, it's STILL better than the FZ20's ISO 200. In fact, the XT's ISO 1600 is comparable to FZ20's ISO 200. This means great pictures even when your not outside in the daytime.Hope you found this helpful :)", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great lens, decent still camera overall, bad movie option", "Author": "A Reader", "ReviewID": "R1CD3ABT7FKZNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to get a new camera for our upcoming trip to Greece. My basic requirements were that it be an ultra-zoom and that it have image stabilization (ultra-zoom isn't much good without it unless you always use a tripod. If you do, you can save about [...] by foregoing IS). I quickly learned that the current sweet-spot of the market for this class of camera is 5 M pixels, so I further narrowed my search to that. The choices were: Panasonic Lumix DMC F20 and F5; Konica Minolta DImage Z5; Sony CyberShot DSC H1; and Canon Poweshot S2 IS. All cameras in this class use an electronic viewfinder (EVF), which I'm not as fond of as optical.I quickly dismissed the Konica because it takes very mediocre pictures. The images just can't compare to anything else in this class in crispness or low noise.The big hurdle for cameras in this class to get over is chromatic aberration. For a lens to be able to bend light to a proper focus across the color spectrum at a zoom of 1x to 12x is a terrific challenge. At the long zooms, lenses tend to show a color \"fringe\" around edges if they aren't exceptionally well made. Of the remaining cameras, Canon was the worst of the lot on this. I have an SD-200, which is an ultra-compact with 3x zoom, and it has a bit of a problem this way. So I was not surprised that the long zoom from them would also have this problem. The Sony is not too bad at this, but chromatic aberration is clearly present at higher zooms. The Panasonic's Leica lens is the stand-out in this regard.As to LCD, the Sony has the largest and brightest of the displays. The Panasonic is second-largest (2-inch screen) and adequately bright. The Canon is the smallest, at 1.5 inches, but has the virtue of folding out and twisting around to allow you to take pictures from odd angles, using it as the viewfinder. Also, it folds into place for storage with its back to the outside word, so its protected against bumps. The Canon is the least visible of the LCDs in bright light, and the size is pretty small for reading menus. For me, each of the LCDs was good enough, and none was ideal.All cameras of this class image-process the data before you ever see a picture. By default, Sony processes their images way too much. They smooth the noise, and then put back the appearance of sharpness by (what I presume to be) unsharp masking. You can see the Gibbs effect on sharp transitions (the image looks like water is lapping against the sharp edge). I find this very irritating. But the images show absolutely no noise, and at first blush look like they are very sharp. I think Sony does this to impress the unwary with \"image quality\" that isn't really there. Canon chooses a middle path on processing by default, and Panasonic allows their wonderful lens' resolution to come through the images, at the expense of higher noise than the other cameras show. All cameras allow you to adjust the processing settings, so this is just their choice for out-of-the-box. I strongly prefer the Panasonic default to the others. I can always smooth the images in PhotoShop if I like, but I can't retrieve the native resolution once its been smoothed away.Manual focus is important to me. The Sony has a rather clunky way of getting at manual focus (keep pushing a button near the shutter button until the viewfinder shows a distance bar, then you can use the rocker switch on the back to focus.) Canon is better. There is a button by the lens to switch to manual focus, and then use the back rocker switch to focus. The FZ5 doesn't support manual focus, so this was when I dropped it from contention. The FZ20 has a switch at the side of the lens that puts it in manual mode. Flick the switch all the way down if you like (it bounces back up to the manual position), and it will auto-focus to get you started. Then, you use a ring around the lens to manually focus, just like a film 35 mm camera. Panasonic won that part of the UI hands down.I don't much care about using the camera for movies. If you do, Canon is the clear winner. It takes full-size M-JPEG video (640x480, 30 fps). You can zoom while you shoot the video (unique to this camera AFAIK). The Sony takes 640x480 30 fps MPEG-1, which has the advantage of being smaller on the camera, but the disadvantage of falling apart if you edit the video after acquiring it. The Panasonic is awful in this regard -- 320x240 30 fps M-JPEG video. But I use a camcorder for video, not a still camera, so I took no points off for this. YMMVAt this point, I had pretty much zeroed in on the Canon vs the FZ20. Because my other camera is a Canon, using the same Digic-II processor that I love, I was favorably disposed to the Canon. The user interface is excellent on Canon cameras, and the color and focus are excellent. I knew that it would take good pictures with little fuss.The FZ20 also has excellent controls -- with one big exception. To change aperture or shutter speed in Program (fully automatic) mode, you need to press the shutter button half-way down, then press the Exposure button on the back of the camera, and then you can adjust using the rocker switch. The maneuver is every bit as awkward as it sounds. However, I seldom use the Program mode -- I normally use aperture priority, and the adjustment interface is perfectly fine for anything other than the Program mode.The Canon has ISO ratings of 50, 100, 200, and 400. The Panasonic's are 80, 100, 200, and 400. What I dislike about the Panasonic on this is that a natural way to use the ISO is as a \"poor man's\" neutral density filter. To do the moral equivalent of adding a 0.3 ND filter, just cut the ISO rating in half. Canon has the right steps for doing that across its range. Also, the Canon has a max. shutter speed of 1/3200, while the Panasonic tops out at 1/2000.One thing that matters to me is using filters. I use a circular polarized filter to cut down on glare, or a graduated neutral density filter for landscapes with a bright sky and dark foreground. The Panasonic comes with the lens adapter to take filters (72mm, which are a bit pricey). The Canon takes 55 mm filters -- a bit cheaper -- but does not come with the adapter. It is apparently not easy to get the adapter, especially if you order the camera itself on-line to save money. Even from a camera store, getting the adapter is apparently \"iffy.\"Ultimately, I just couldn't get away from the quality of the Leica lens. In addition to virtually no chromatic aberration, the uniformity of focus and illumination of the lens across the field I wanted to get a new camera for our upcoming trip to Greece. My basic requirements were that it be an ultrazoom and that it have image stabilization (ultrazoom isn't much good without it unless you always use a tripod. If you do, you can save about $150 by foregoing IS). I quickly learned that the current sweet-spot of the market for this class of camera is 5 MPixels, so I further narrowed my search to that. The choices were: Panasonic Lumix DMC F20 and F5; Konica Minolta DImage Z5; Sony CyberShot DSC H1; and Canon Poweshot S2 IS. All cameras in this class use an electronic viewfinder (EVF), which I'm not as fond of as optical.A few final points on the Panasonic FZ5 vs the FZ20. The FZ5 is about $100 less expensive than the FZ20. However, in addition to no manual focus, the FZ5 does not use ED glass in its Leica lens -- a big difference (adds to chromatic aberration). It also does not have a constant f/2.8 max aperture across the whole zoom -- it creeps up to f/3.3 at the longer lens settings. The constant f is unique to the FZ20 in this class of camera AFAIK, and is a very nice touch. The FZ5 does not have a hot shoe for external flash, which is a big disadvantage. For other differences, go to the [...]I have purchased the FZ20 and begun the learning curve for getting the max out of the camera. This is a camera for enthusiasts more than for causal photographers. I expet it will take me a few months of experimentation in different contexts to really fully appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of this camera. But it is clearly a wonderful device.", "Date": "September 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "The Reviews Have Been Proven", "Author": "PaulRevere", "ReviewID": "RKG9RAPPNU2S1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, allow me to give a brief history on my owned camers. The first good camera I bought was a Minolta Maxxum 7000 back in the mid 80's. This was a good camera and I took many pictures over the years. The first digital I bought was the 3MP Olympus C3000 in 2001. In mid 2004, the camera bit the dust (unfixable). Luckily, I had an extended warranty and the retailer allowed me to choose another camera which cost the same as the Olympus. The only one they had in stock which suited me at the time was Kodak's DX7590. I kept the camera for a couple of months and even though it took good pictures, something just wasn't right. The detail was lacking, shots were not consistent and white balance was off at times. Even though it was a little faster than the Oly, still something was missing. Since it was a replacement, and I was ready to upgrade anyhow, selling it outright would not be a loss to me.I wanted a good camera in the $500 range, at least 5MP and a powerful zoom. I researched and researched, and everything seem to lead me back to the Panasonic FZ20 time and time again. I was nervous about complaints on some noise, dim LCD and battery life.  I ordered the FZ20 and I must say I made a good decision. Maybe I've had bad apples in the past and didn't know a good digital when I saw one, but the Panasonic far exceeds my expectations.It is quick to focus (even in a dim lit room). The zoom is fast and awesome. The histogram is a nice feature. The noise is not detectable for 99% of the shots, and probably 100% of the shots for most users. The flash has a very good range, as well. It reminds me a lot of my Maxxum 7000 in the feel, functionality, and operation. I took and compared similar pictures with the Kodak and found that the Kodak was richer in color, but the Panasonic was clearer. However, the Panasonic has settings which increased saturation. As far as the the LCD brightness, I'm not sure where those complaints come from. It's bright enough for me. It does dim a little when you press the shutter, but that is no concern to me at that point.If you are looking for a simple, no thrills, point and shoot camera, the Panasonic may not be for you. Don't get me wrong, the panasonic produces good pictures by pointing and shooting, but you have much more control over varying situations if you need that control. I think it is more of a professional camera than the Kodak and Oly, which I previously owned.Not sure on what color to get? Silver or Black. That was a hard decision for me, but I recommend the black. It's sharp looking, and any lens accessories you buy will probably be black, too. I've heard that when silver finishes wear they show black. That was enoght to turn me against the silver.So, if you are looking for a 5MP range, long zoom, professional feel and operation type camera, which takes excellent pictures, look no further. I think the Panasonic DMC-FZ20 will make you happy.Update: After two months of use, I like this camera even more. I always display the most recent pictures as a slideshow screensaver (full screen) on our PC. Looking over the Christmas pictures, I am intrigued by the clarity, color richness, and natural look given by these photographs. I've also purchased a lens tube adapter (Raynox RT5264P) and attached a 52mm UV filter. If you want your camera to look even sharper, get the lens adapter. The lens hood which comes with the camera is nice to have gotten, but it is mainly for bright light situations, and  the thread size is like 72mm. The hood is good for wide angle, but zoom shots have a decreased angle of view, can can cause flare and ghost images. [...]", "Date": "December 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "vs. Canon S2 IS", "Author": "A. Johnston", "ReviewID": "RSRQ7UERMFCI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Both of these cameras boast 12x optical zoom, 5 megapixels and Image Stabilization but they are very different cameras. Here are some generalizations I came to while researching them myself:People who would be happier with the FZ20: photographers with more serious/artistic ambitions who still want a fun, simple camera; people attracted to the more classy look and feel of rangefinder cameras from the 70s; people who want a lens made by a classic camera company (Leica) mounted on a body made by a company who knows electronics (Panasonic); people who really just want to take pictures and could care less about taking home movies or messing around with RAW software (the FZ20 stores TIFF files which can be directly read without need for RAW conversion.)People who might be happier with the Canon S2 IS: folks who want a sportier camera with better general-purpose performance in a more compact body; people who really enjoy making home movies on their digicams in addition to taking reliable still photographs (fun at parties); people who are less artistically-motivated and care more about specs than character; people with smaller hands; people who do not care for the look or feel of older cameras.These are just generalizations. As always, it's best to actually demo each camera for yourself. I chose the FZ20 for many of the reasons stated above and because I already have a Canon DSLR setup and wanted to try something different.I use the FZ20 mainly for black-and-white shooting in congested urban situations and find the combination of the Leica lens and the zoom/IS to be incredible. Although I felt the lens on the Canon was well made, the images I get with the Leica just seem more artful and I think the camera itself is a total work of art.If you do go with the FZ20, I strongly suggest buying a SanDisc 1GB Ultra II SD card if you plan to shoot in the highest resolution at TIFF quality. Each shot takes up 14.4megs and even a 512mb card will only hold about 30 images at this setting. I recommend the Ultra II cards because they read/write at exponentially faster rates than the standard cards and this is extremely important when dealing with 14.4mb files.", "Date": "June 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "Do yourself a favor !

After misplacing and losing the Olympus ( I'm a Senior which explain's that), researched all the net sources and popped for the Panasonic. The Leica optics, great optical zoom and good reviews to that point(all two of them), plus a Circuit City sale pushed me over the edge.Cut to the chase: The camera has excellent feel, like a 35mmSLR except much lighter. The manual is very well done with easily understandable instructions. I was up an shooting almost immediately. Being an old SLR shooter I prefer the EVF viewfinder and the conversion between that and the LCD are a single button click. The FAST lens lets me shoot in available light almost all the time and going to flash is SO quick( compared to my lost O).Low light photography is one really nice feature. I took some pics of my son-in law with his 1st bow and arrow deer after sunset. I could barely see him but the camera focused perfectly.Needless to say the 5 MP CCD produces excellent quality pics when I set my printer to max resolution.

More recently I have gone thru 3 digitalcameras, an HP215, a Pentax EI200, and a Canon A70. The Canon had thewidest zoom range at 3x and I also used a 2.4x Canon teleconverter with it.So it was a handful as well.  I wanted to simplify my life, and yet preserve the quality of the photos Iam accustomed to taking. In other words as much zoom range, built in manualfunctions, external flash capability, etc, but NOT a 5-10 lbs bag ofaccessories everywhere I go. Not really of utmost importance was themegapixel resolution, I have taken prize winning and nationwide calendarphotos with a 2 megapixel camera. Many schools of thought here, add thisone; a hi res monitor will display 1280x1024 pixels with sometimes painfulclarity and sharpness. Yet that is barely 1.5 megapixel, the source and thequality (dynamic range, edge sharpness, focus) of the original have as muchimpact as the number of dots. This became important when I chose the FZ20,as the other camera in consideration was the Nikon 8800 (The Minolta Z5photo quality made it a non starter). It had 8 vs 5 meg resolution, but notthat wonderful Leica f2.8 lens, and that's f2.8 at 430mm! Compare that tothe Nikon's f5.2 at only 350mm. In photography the lens is everything. Indigital photography, that is closely followed by the CCD sensor size (theNikon is ahead here, however both camera test results show objectionablenoise at ISO200 and higher, so shoot at 80 or 100 ISO when possible). So adigital SLR was too big and required a bag of lenses, the one lens thatcame with the Nikon was only so-so, and the Panasonic got the nod ofapproval.So how does it fare after 4 weeks and about 1500 photos? Very well indeed.The Lens is outstanding, the image stabilization works superbly, the 4 fpsmotor drive is great, and the pictures are tack sharp and stunning inquality.

Most standard digital cams have only a 3x optical zoom but I recommend at least a 6x; this camera had lots of spare zoom for me at 12x, but I am already finding it handy. Do not underestimate this feature in its ability to deliver good photos!There are some small compromises, however. For example, it's bulky and awkwardly designed; not as bad as a traditional SLR but not as conveniently compact as most digital cameras. Also, you have to manually pop the flash up for indoor shots; I wish they made this an automatic option. Finally, while image quality is mostly quite good I don't like color balance as much as on my old Fuji Finepix.

What does need to be said is the ease of use and quality of photo that results with this camera.  I am a novice photographer.  Nobody pays me for my work.  I do it because I enjoy it.  The result of that is more often than not, I use standard settings, and with this camera, that is 99% of the time a fantastic photo.  I have used every function on the camera, and each and every time I have moved from the standard setting the result has been an amazing photo.

Menus are clear and easy to use, and switching between functions is fool proof.The optics on this camera are outstanding.  If you are buying a digital camera, the digital zoom is virtually worthless as a consideration for purchase.  The optical zoom (in this case 12x) is the critical zoom function.

Srinivasan", "ReviewID": "R2N1B0ILHOGX9Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially read reviews on CNET and here and went with the Canon S2 IS, primarily because of a good experience with the Canon Powershot A60 and unfamiliarity with Panasonic in the camera business.Assumed that with the larger aperture (and higher price) the Canon S2 IS would get better pictures than the Canon Powershot A60... unfortunately, got no better clarity when using the autofocus. A couple of sharp pictures in macro mode, but the others, esp. outdoors in overcast conditions were not sharp. The movie mode of the S2 was excellent, however, with very high resolution, 640 x 480, so believe the trouble was with the autofocus algorithm and its interaction with the hardware. Also, the viewfinder was grainy, and manual focus was hard with it. Had to return it to Amazon - not good enough for a $500 camera.I then went back to the other choice on the plate, the Panasonic Lumix FZ20K and reread the reviews. Was happy to see the emphasis on sharp pictures, and ordered it, this time with the higher speed SD-II card (512K, which is quite an adequate size). I also took the advice of an earlier reviewer and picked up a snap-on 52mm/55mm adapter from [...] and a Quantaray 55mm multi-layered coating UV filter from Adorama via Amazon - the combination keeps the lens protected and is also compact.Initial results with autofocus with the Lumix were not still up to expectations, but better than the Canon - there were a couple of very clear shots indicating that the reviews I read were not gibberish, but that I needed to use the camera better.After fiddling around for a day or so, realized that the best way to really use this camera is to go to the manual mode on exposure and focus whenever possibleMANUAL EXPOSUREThere is a convenient exposure button to start the setup and an easy-to-use four-way button to set both aperture and shutter timing. Smaller apertures (1/5.6 is smaller than 1/2.8) provide for clarity over a larger range of image depth but with less light; Shorter shutter timing (1/250 is faster than 1/60) is good for fast action situations, but again there is less total light for the exposure. Depending on the situation, one can also go semi-automated with priority for the aperture setting (aperture priority) or for the shutter speed (shutter priority).MANUAL FOCUSThe manual focus mode was easier to use than with Canon S2 IS, esp. since the electronic viewfinder in the Lumix FZ20K is far clearer. A somewhat-grainy window pops up in the middle of the screen, and you can rotate the focus adjustment on the lens till that section becomes sharp (it remains a grainy picture, but it is hard to not get the focus right, esp. if there is any high contrast line in the scene).I also used the exposure bracketing feature - the camera takes three pictures at different exposure settings very quickly, and one can select how different the exposures have to be. In the manual mode there is a histogram feature also - don't know how it works, but know you have to have it be centered in the box for optimal exposure.After I understood how to use these options in this camera, it has been a breeze getting sharp pictures.Don't need exposure bracketing any more, but have found it is a cool feature in another way - the three shots get taken close to each other, fractions of a second apart. Hence if you set the exposure difference to be minimal, say 1/3 apart, the exposure bracketing gets you three pictures and this allows for selection of the best picture. Am amazed how fast my 1-1/2 yr old son can change expression in about a second :) And if someone blinks during a group shot, one of the other two bracketing shots should catch them with eyes open.Haven't yet really explored the two IS (image stabilization) modes or what the ISO setting is about. I took the advice of one of the reviewers here and have turned off the digital zoom (no real need for more than 12X) and also have turned the continuous autofocus off (go manual anyway by now, four days into the camera). Am sure there is more to discover with this camera.Am very happy with the clarity of the pictures, and am willing to put up with the slight graininess when you blow up the images.The video mode is a bit puzzling - haven't been able to view the clips yet, since I was trying to continue to use Zoombrowser. This is one aspect where the Canon is clearly better. But a $500 digital camera should at a minimum take great still pictures, and in that respect, the Lumix scores over the Canon.This camera has brought thrill back to photography for me (used to have an all manual Ricoh a long time ago, then switched to the small auto units and forgot all about the nuances of photography).

What SLR allows you to compensate AE levels in the viewfinder in 1/3 EV steps and observe the results as you do so? The image stabilization is impressive allowing one to use much slower shutter speeds without the problem of shake.

Naturally, there are a few quibbles.  Autofocus sometimes misses completely in less than bright light (even with the AF lamp on) but it is very easy to switch to manual focus and use the enlarged portion in the viewfinder to obtain critical focus.

These comments are based on my own experience, balanced by what I have read on other digital camera forums.Noise-- easily noticeable on an 8 by 10, at ISO 100.  Navy blue pants had red specks.  This is a function of the small sensor, which allows the long lens at a reasonable size.  I have read that the FZ15 (4 mp)  has less noise, almost all the same features.  The lesson learned is that sensor size makes a big difference, you do not want higher megapixels without increasing the sensor size.Viewfinder \"freeze\"-- When using 3-zone focus, when you are test focussing by halfway pressing shutter, frame freezes.  Disrupting to try to shoot picure when this occurs.  Avoidable with other focussing modes.Downloading pictures-- When using windows camera wizard, pictures do not appear and do not download in the order you took them, unlike my Canon S30.  You have to pick through the old and new picture to download.Filter use-- Camera has unorthodox filter system, comes with lens hood which will accept 72 mm filters, but at some distance from the lens, increasing storage bulk.  People are buying various aftermarket filter adapters, but these increase the bulk of the camera when the camera is off.  (Camera lens retracts during shutoff ).  I am going to try a Nextphoto.net filter adapter which snaps into the retracting lens, to get both filter capability AND the compact size during storage.Instruction manual-- Could be a bit more educational/explanatory, not too clear in many spots.White balance-- Unlike a CanonS30 which I still use, I find the colors sometimes seem dull and bluish-- some think faces look pink, especially with flash.

After doing more research I discovered that it was possible to take good pix with it with some tinkering, but not, generally, with the \"auto\" settings.Not what I had in mind.Sending it back after two weeks of puttering about with it, I bought the FZ20K.YESSSS!!!!I was taking fabulous pix right out the box, and even shifting exposure settings and such to realize special effects and so on.  The camera is bulkier than the minolta, but I find it more intuitive and I don't have to putz around with the controls to get good snapshots.  Along with the 12x optical zoom on the Leica lens, the ability to capture great shots with all the special scene modes, and video with sound, I have to say that this is the 5 mp digital camera to have, hands down!NOTE:  I bought a three-piece filter kit and adapter tube along with this camera from A& M photo world (amphotoworld.com - ask for Tyler), a couple of extra battery packs from thomasdistributing.com, 3 ATP 512mb SD cards (60x), a universal ac adapter, a full-size and a desktop tripod, and a camera bag from microcenter, and I am now looking forward to capturing some good pix on our vacation in Hawaii.Total price of this package:  around $750.00 with taxes and shipping included and well worth it.", "Date": "March 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best super zoom camera except for the ccd smear", "Author": "Kyle T.

Do a search on the internet and you'll quickly see it's high ratings. Pic quality is outstanding and the manual features are incredible. With a super fast SD card, it writes massive 13 meg images in under 1.5 seconds, which is incredible. Zoom is amazing. Crispness is to die for. The only minor complaint is that, like almost all other digital cameras, it exhibits ccd smear (vertical lines) when aiming at pinpoint lights (such as Xmas tree lights, headlights, the sun, etc.). This smear effect is most evident in zoom over 6x, but it really shows up on the LCD because it's of such a high quality. These smears do not appear in still pictures that you take, but if you were filming a  movie, they would. Since about 99.9% of the time I'm not shooting Xmas tree lights, headlights, and the sun, I can live with with it. Just be aware that this is a common occurence on digicams and if you see it happening, don't be alarmed. It's normal and won't effect your still shots at all.

I have an old kodak dc 290 which I plan to use as a back up and it has provided great service, but when comparing this camera with the comparable kodak 10x 5mp it is no contest regarding the solid construction and design of this camera and metal lens housing in addition to the quality pics.  The menu, dial and other functions are very user friendly and so far it performs consistently with all previous positive reviews.  The flash is small but powerful and is more than adequate for a variety of circumstances.  I like the step down feature of the flash output. The live histogram and focus assist are also great features and there are many others.

It started with the compact cameras in the 80s, the cheap japanese cameras with their tiny little slow lens. For the first time people realized that good pictures can still be taken with tiny lens instead of the big expensive 35mm instruments.  Since that time the cheap japanese cameras used this to the extreme that noise was so obvious. In the digital age, compact cameras are still doing that and gets poor noise control simply because of not enough light through the lens.  DSLR is much better for this purpose, except that a good huge lens is hard to manufacture, unlike smaller lenses. DSLR and the tiny little lenses used in most compact digital cameras are the two ends of consumer photography. A balance of the amount of light and the quality of lens allowable for consumers.  FZ series is such a good example of this elegant balance. I've used the FZ-1, FZ-10, and now the FZ-20. They are simply the king of the jungle. With the constant F/2.8, they conquer the shortcoming of light deficiency of compact digital cameras. With the proven Leica lens design, they provide lens of beauty.  The reasons I upgrade my FZ-10 to FZ-20 are as follows:1. FZ20 separates the link between metering and focusing. In FZ-10 if you want spot-metering, you also have to use spot-focusing. But in FZ-20, you can do spot-metering with any kind of metering options.2. FZ20 has the more realistic knob layout so you can exchange A/S/M modes without going to the menus, as FZ-10 was designed.3. I can sell my old FZ-10 for the price of a new FZ-20 on amazon now4. other minor reasons such as an AF assist lamp, much more powerful flash, and 1M pixels, faster focusing, cooler petal hood, etc.etc.  I know that after the engineering wonders of FZ-1 and FZ-20, I can expect beauty out of FZ-20, and I did.

Although this camera takes very good outdoor pictures, it wasn't so good indoors and even outdoors would sometimes have trouble focussing if you zoomed in too close.  For the purposes I wanted to use it - photographing fine lace and dolls for my e-books - it was next to useless.So after many months of dreaming, thinking and comparing review after review I began to get closer this week.  I looked at the Fuji S7000 and S20 Pro, Sony DSC-828, Nikon Coolpix 8800, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ5, and a number of other similar superzoom cameras.  Every time I compared any of them to the Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ20 the only camera which came anywhere near to it was the FZ5.  So today it ended up being a battle between the FZ5 and FZ20 and when I saw the FZ20K beside the FZ5 in Jessops today the battle was over.  I would have liked the silver but Jessops only had the black model; nevertheless the FZ20 it was.So far I have had the battery charged for about half an hour - way to go Panasonic, it only takes 2 hours to charge the battery for this large camera - and basically the camera is light years ahead of my Fuji Finepix 2600 camera (which takes perfectly good indoor pictures but often requires some adjustments in lighting arrangements) and the aforementioned Minolta Dimage Z2.  The lense is frankly amazing to see, and the camera is packed in the box with a lense cover protecting it.  The camera and lens hood and lens hood adaptor are carefully wrapped in a soft protective plastic wrap within the box, to minimise the chances of any damage.The menus are easy to navigate with very little instruction and the manual is not one of those which provides minimal information and then expects you to print out hundreds of pages from a PDF file.  It contains all the information you would need to operate the camera, all the safety information and everything into a 118 page booklet which is clearly laid out and easy to follow.  There is a lot of information to digest, but then this camera is really a DSLR with some point and shoot functions.  It compared favourably in appearance with the Canon EOS 300D which one of the other people in the shop had with him.  It certainly is no toy and will provide both point and shoot enthusiasts and manual control enthusiasts with an excellent range of facilities.The camera of course has full manual capabilities as well as a wide range of modes and different settings for the image sizes as you would expect.  The flash is operated by a button on the back - an advantage in some museums where you are allowed to take photographs provided you disable the flash.  The zoom is wonderful and it's exciting to watch the camera autofocus stabiliser working and focussing beautifully on the area you want it to photograph.I took photographs of some fine tatted lace this evening - if you don't know what tatting is look at my web site, [...] - and you could see every stitch.  This is something that my Fuji Finepix 2600 2 megapixel camera could accomplish with care, good lighting and macro photography on a tripod; the Panasonic does it without any zoom at all and just holding the camera a few inches from the lace - this in a hallway which is not particularly well lit in the evenings.Way to go Panasonic, this is a wonder camera which will provide many years of photographic enjoyment!", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "This FZ20 has put the fun back into taking pictures", "Author": "Bob \"rww319\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q2XS7W3HPEWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the DMC-FZ20K over the Labor Day week-end.

I was having problems with slow shutter speeds on all of them and my shots were very blurry. The only way I could get them to be less fuzzy was by using the flash which wasn't appropriate for all the shots I was taking. I didn't like using a tripod either to get steadier clearer shots so I decided it was time to look for a much better camera.I searched the web for reviews on cameras with quicker shutter speeds, which were not too expensive. I really wanted a digital DSLR camera but when I saw the prices I realized I couldn't afford them. I found a few models that were in the DSLR style. I was crossed between the Canon PowerShot S2 IS, this Panasonic model FZ20 and the Sony Cyber-shot\u00ae DSC-H1 Digital CameraDSC-H1. It was a very difficult choice but I decided on the Panasonic DMC-FZ20 because it seemed to have a cult following. Not to mention I have had problems before with Sony products in the past so I was wary of another Sony product.Today my camera arrived and when I took it out of the box I instantly fell in love! It is a very sturdy, well made camera. I really like the way it looks because it has the look and feel of a professional 35 mm camera professional photographers use. It looks bigger than the product pictures show, however it is not too heavy. By the looks and feel you can see it is not a cheaply made camera and is very sturdy. It feels really good in my hands.I quickly charged the battery and fired it up. I couldn't wait to start taking pictures. I quickly skimmed the manual, but have to admit I didn't read it in depth {I will do that later}. When I took my 1st shot which was indoors in bad lighting I was very surprised! It was like night and day compared to my other point and shoot digital Olympus cameras I have been using. The image stabilizer really works well and is a Godsend! I didn't have to use my flash and the pictures came out without no blur. Way to go Panasonic!Next, I took it outdoors and it is a very overcast cloudy day.

In comparison to those cameras, which are very good (I prefer the S30 as the images are a little less over-exposed outdoors), the FZ20 is far easier to use, has a superior LCD screen, and has some significantly better features. For example, the FZ20 has a bracket function which allows the user to make three exposures simultaneously at three different user-defined exposure settings in order to allow selection of the best result. Since this camera also tends to overexpose bright spots in outdoor sunlight as the Canon S50, this bracket option allows selection of a preferred exposure. Obviously the 12x zoom lens is a nice feature, but also the ease of adjusting flash fill, picture deletion... I could go on at length about the ease-of-use of the menu system... One feature missing that is present in the Canon models is the on-board ability to set up stitch photos and, even though software is supplied to accomplish this on the computer, it is no substitute for an on-board system. Also, the software provided with the FZ20 for Macintosh is restricted to a very slow PhotoImpression software which is very disappointing compared to Canon's offering.

Granted, this results in a camera with more lens than body, but that is part of what gives it it's nice SLR feel.Powering on and off is quick and smooth.  The Olympus takes its own sweet time to extend the lens when powering up, and always had a kind of grinding noise that was rather unsettling.

We also do weddings, graduations, etc.We have not purchased pro cameras but prefer the upper line consumer cameras for obvious reasons.  Our last two cameras have been this one and a Nikon D50 D-SLR.  Before that we had a Sony DSC-F828.  All of these are great cameras with particular strengths  and on their own do a great job.But for me, the FZ20 is the best all-around digital camera I've ever owned and used.  It will take pictures of anything and do an excellent job 99% of the time.  The difficult shots for me are the high-glare, low light photos I take a lot of and this camera will do it every time.The high glare shots are taken one of two ways: with controlled lighting and in low light.  We use a photo booth setting using daylight flourescent bulbs to flood the subject and the FZ20 does it right.  In the low light, natural indoors setting, I turn the flash on and set the image stabilization to Mode 2 and 99.9% of the time I get a clear, in-focus, accurate photo.

First, it is much smaller than a full-fledged 35mm digital SLR from the likes of Nikon, Canon or Minolta. But more importantly, it has an image-stabilized non-interchangeable Leica Vario-Elmarit zoom lens which is undoubtedly one of the finest lenses available in digital photography. I have become quite a fan of Panasonic's Lumix line of digital cameras, and this camera is yet another excellent representative. I'm quite impressed with the optical excellence demonstrated by the Leica lens, though frankly I am not surprised, since I rely extensively on Leica optics in my Leica M rangefinder camera kit.

I have had this camera for upwards of about a week or 2, and I still suck at taking pictures. But this camera is so versatile you'd never even notice how bad I am at it. It's very easy to use, while still being adaptable almost to a fault. It's not clunky like some other cameras I've seen, yet it's still sleek while being loaded with features you wouldn't expect (like some other cameras). Buttons and settings are all easy to get to. It has many preprogrammed settings in already (for the REAL amateurs). I find myself always looking out the window for things I could shoot, because with the SD cards, it takes pictures quite rapidly, even the large ones. And if you're feeling frisky, you can take some nice panorama shoots that are HDTV widescreen compatible. I already have. The camera includes pretty much everything but the kitchen sink. The 16MB card is a laughable inclusion since the standard settings will fill it up in about 5 minutes. But I've found high end SD cards at stores at prices that make me feel like I should have a gun in my hand when I buy them.I LOVE this camera, and it's been a great tool in helping me get the feel for the art of photography.

The lens is stunning, fast and clear with an amazing zoom ratio. I got this camera when I was fascinated with photographing ducks. The 430mm equivalent zoom is perfect for bird photography. Compared to an SLR with equivalent length of zoom it's so light and easy to handle. And with a 36mm equivalent wide angle it replaces an entire kit of lenses. And with a 2.8 aperture it's remarkably fast for such a zoom.My biggest complaint is that the with a minimum aperture of F8 I can't get quite the depth of field that I'd sometimes like. Some other features are a bit dated, too. Maximum movie size is 320 x 240 pixels. The USB connector is only the slower version 1. But since I don't like hauling multiple lenses around (or changing them in bad weather) and don't really use this as a movie camera, it's still the camera that goes on hikes with me. If you can find a used one at a good price don't worry about the 5 MP limit. The few photos that I've needed to print at a large size, I've taken to a print shop that does giclee printing.

Well it's been a couple years and this camera is still my all-time favorite.  Lumix has come up with some really nice cameras that are more compact and have that advantage, but wow, the photos from the FZ20 are just spectacular. Hope it lasts forever.  I've bought some new batteries and more memory cards <grin>======================I got the FZ20 when it first came out.  It was an addition to several other digital and film cameras that I own.Having been a semi-pro photographer for years, we have to realize that different people look for different things in a camera.  That's one reason why I have a lot of cameras.However, if size is not a factor but I still can't carry a complete camera bag with interchangeable lenses, then my go-to camera is the FZ20.  Why? Well, if I am shooting in low light, the results with either a Sunpak 422D or Metz 60CT is great.  Also, in normal situations where the onboard flash will work or in available light situations within the range of the camera, the lens on this hummer will catch shots that I would otherwise not get.  The incredible zoom range, quality within the range and 2.8 aperture are an incredible combination.  Think about it.  And while it is 5 MP, because of the broad zoom range, there is far less need to crop a photo later on, losing resolution.  With the FZ20 one has far greater flexibility in framing and cropping the photo in the camera, using the lens. The results are pretty stunningThe camera has been very reliable over the years, taken lots of bumps and bruises, and just doesn't quit.  No problems whatsoever. Destined to become a classic, I think.The internal battery is pretty good, and I always carry a spare, but I use external batteries with this to help keep me going during a shoot.CONS, well there are a few.  Not the best for video display of shots taken at extremely low light, but print results look good.Some people have complained about the viewfinder and screen, I find that they work perfectly well for me, and would not have wanted to buy the camera at a higher cost for something better than it has.This is another common complaint that I read about... and that is image quality of cameras.  Too often the image quality will vary depending on whether the photo is being displayed on a computer screen or printed.  And if it's printed, the printer and paper used.  When printing either at a lab or on my dye sub printer, I have never had a bad photo with this camera, except for, say, user error.OTOH, photos taken with my non-Lumix cameras tend to look flat and uninspiring by comparison.  There is something about the Leica lenses that makes people really flip out over the Lumix shots.Also, the location of the SD card is in the BOTTOM of the camera, which is a drag when using a tripod.  You have to unscrew the camera from the tripod base to get to the card. Max card capacity is 2GB. Which is generally enough. Why they didn't mount the card in the side of the camera is a mystery.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "WORTH EVERY PENNY!!", "Author": "smartydog904 \"bluedog\"", "ReviewID": "R2B6Y1UOLSQSDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic has shocked me with the quality of the Lumix FZ20! Camera has great features, from beginner to expert. easy to use and fun to take pictures with. The zoom is VERY good! once you use camera a few times, you can learn to deal with small problems with lcd screen, such as wash out in bright light. or focus problems, in changing lighting conditions. many fine add on products available, such as tele conversion lenses and filters. If your into high zoom cameras this ones great! just make sure to buy a high quality tripod, something made very sturdy! Picture quality is clear and crisp in most of the lens range. under full tele zoom there is a little fuzzyness, but that can be compensated for thru purchase of add on tele conversion lens for extreme zoom shots. (Raynox 2020 2.2 is good example.) Purchasing a good quality printer will help as well. (Epson Picturemate deluxe viewer is a good match at a good price.) Panasonic has really done a great job with this camera, menu is easy to use, and with a little time you get the hang of this camera pretty quick. would recommend it to friends and family. The only thing that is a bit of a pain is that the battery runs out quickly, so if you take alot of pictures, make sure you purchase a few extra batteries!It can be a real pain when using a tripod, since it covers battery compartment. There's just not enuff time or space to write about all the great features of this camera! every camera has minor flaws, but this one is way more to offer than to complain about! HAPPY SHOOTING!Well it's 5 years later- I just love this camera!! I can even shoot it with one hand and no blur!! The internal components just work, period!! This camera looks and feels like a high quality should. I just purchased Panasonic's FZ40 a 14mp 24 x zoom  camera, and they changed the body style, smaller and lighter, internal components changed for the worse, I must say in comparison to the earlier FZ20 the FZ40 needs work. I shot an Eagle family with babies with the FZ20 and attached a Raynox 2.2 conversion and got shots in the exact same quality as the FZ40 (also with conversion lens)! I was majorly disappointed!  I figure that since my FZ20 was getting older and newer cameras had more megapixels and longer zoom range I'd get a much better shot and clearer photo, nope, I was wrong!! This FZ20 is built to a high quality! I think these camera companies are trying to stuff 10 lbs of \"stuff\" into a 5 lb bag!! Let's turn a camera into everything, it can shoot movies, 10001 scenes, even take the photo for you. ENOUGH, some people just want a quality camera, with quality components! The FZ20 is your camera. FZ20 comes with a great pocket manual, new one is on disk, big error Panasonic! Especially since the FZ40 is extremely complicated with way too many poor scene setting that just don't cut it. The FZ20 is far simpler, easier to handle and has less blur and graininess then the \"new & improved\" model.I'm sooo glad I purchased this camera, just can't say enough GREAT things about it, even 5 years later. It's my main \"go to\" for those gotta have it right the first time shots.Panasonic- Stop competing with the 'Other guy\" go back to competing with yourself, you'll have better success and SALES!!Check out my eagle nest photo's for zoom quality, also giraffe and Lion & polar bear snarl!", "Date": "August 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "weezerwil \"weezerwil\"", "ReviewID": "RBP43SCQP2QGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I are novice photographers.

Not only was it easy to use -the menu is quick and easy to figure out; the 12x optical zoom is fantastic; you can turn off the digital zoom - a must; and I have more manual control over the camera.  The downside, and there always is one, is that it doesn't handle lighting well on the auto setting.  Great pictures outdoors in sunlight; but easily overexposes the brightest parts.  Indoors it does well, still the light handling with and without the flash leaves a bit to be desired, but nothing I can't fix in a good photo program.

Absolutely love this camera and I never leave home without it.  This is without a doubt the best camera on the market in its class second only to the much more expensive D-SLRs.  The only thing needed for this camera is the proper lighting. Buy yourself an external flash (Sunpak 383) and you can't go wrong. Try not to shoot over ISO 100 as this creates noise (distortion) in the picture. The lens gives unbelievably clear and colorful pictures. The pictures look as if they came from a camera costing thousands of dollars. There is a big learning curve when you graduate from a point & shoot to this baby.If you are new to photography start off in the automatic modes i.e full auto mode (program) or Aperture priority. Take some time to really learn this camera to find out its strengths and limitations. Read and study the manual. And if you are really serious as I am about photography read, study, and practice all you can about aperture, shutter speed and lighting. There are those that will tell you that you will need a SLR to take professional quality pictures totally untrue.  It is true that SLRs take very good quality pictures and it's mostly because of the bigger image sensor and capability to utilize higher ISOs with very little noise.

Well, after spending quite a bit of money purchasing some of the digitals, I never felt that \"wow effect\" until I came across this beauty.  First, I did as most smart consumers do and researched as well as read the reviews.  The reviews and specs were good enough to purchase this model above all the others including other Panasonics.  This camera takes amazing shots, and still allows you to manually change the settings if you choose to do so. A plus to this is by inserting a high capacity memory card, you can shoot a video scene for the length of the mem card. Of course this does not take the place of a quality camcorder, nor can you adjust any of the settings once you are in video mode such as zoom, but the feature alone plus the quality is awesome. This past summer we took this camera on vacation with us and shot beautiful sunsets and great video of our son surfing.  I have dozens of cd's with incredible video footage even the birth of our first grandson.  I recommend this camera 100%, and it can still be had for less than $300. if you shop around. If you want a quality digital with a 35mm feel then go for it! One more very important thing, the accessories are very expensive if you buy them from Panasonic. This beauty has a hot shoe for an extra flash and now here's the kicker, I decided to see if my Vivitar 283 flash would work on the camera and YES it did. As a matter of fact all my flashes work,but of course they should be used for extreme cases because the built in flash is great.

The images from 80 or 100 ISO are great but when you need to up the ISO to 200 or 400, the images get a lot of noise and the quailty decreases greatly.  I do whatever I can to avoid having to use ISO 400.  Even with the noise reduction set to high, the image quality is still pretty bad.  (If you're indoors, you can use the flash of course)The 12x zoom was one of the major reasons I got this camera over others when it came out.  It maintains a f/2.8 apeture throughout the zoom when set to Apeture Priority which means less depth of field even at 12x zoom.A problem I had was the viewfinder being digital.  It's frustrating to try and shoot sports when you can't see what you're shooting.  I'll push the shutter and the screen goes black for a second.  When shooting in burst, it stays blank so I can only hope I'm getting the action.  The LCD also does the same.  One of the advantages of getting a DSLR instead is that they have optical viewfinders so you can see what you're shooting as you shoot.Overall, I would recomend this camera for anyone that plans on doing a lot of shooting in good lighting conditions.  This camera would also be great for beginners but for anyone that is a mid-level or advanced photographer, I would not recomend this camera.PROs--Great image quality at ISO 80 or 100-12x zoom that maintains f2.8 apeture-easy to use-lots of manual functions to experiment with-durable, sturdy camera body-Supports my 2GB memory card for plenty of picturesCONs--Horrible image quality at ISO 400-No 800 or 1600 ISO-slow shutter lag-Zooming in and out is slow-digital viewfinderPersonally, I would recomend getting one of the beginners DSLR's such as a Nikon D40, D50 or a Canon Rebel XT.

Well I knew it was good but what I got was better than I expected. The construction is much better the that of the Canon IS series ( I used to own an IS ) and the camera handles amazingly well. There is no lack of controls like some reviews seem to point out and the functions that Panasonic has chosen to keep in the software menus alone are things that you don't really use that often. The only 2 that I would have liked better with a dedicated button are white balance and ISO settings.As far as picture quality goes I am amazed how good pictures FZ20 takes on auto settings. This is truly a camera that's easy enough for a beginner to use. What I like even better is that you get settings that allow you to modify only some of the features ( f stops etc. ) so you can really grow as a photographer with the camera. Now back to the quality of the pictures. I took over 100 pictures on my visit to a cave this summer. Needless to say FZ20 has some problems with high ISO settings. I was using ISO 200 and the cave had hardly any light in it and it was all artificial. Well the results with the build in flash were simply amazing and it was done in auto mode. Those pictures alone would have sold the camera for me.Star up time is about 3 secs and while the newer FZ models start faster the price difference and the increase of size makes FZ20 a truly great choice. I can't recommend this camera enough. Oh yeah , buy an extra battery or 2.

I am a digital enthusiast, and I bought this camera right after it came out.  I like the fact that it has tremendous zoom capabilities.  36-432mm in 35mm speak.  What is really nice is that it is F2.8 throughout the entire focal length.  That's a fast lens.  Panasonic has not duplicated this in subsequent iterations of this camera.  I have not had any of the problems if the camera not working like some other people have had.  It has been a great camera, but it does have some serious drawbacks in my opinion.First of all is the noise levels on most of the images.  Even at ISO 80 you are going to see quite a bit of noise in the images produced and for a camera this expensive this shouldn't be a problem.  The HP 935 that I use to have took less noisy images then this thing did, and having to run all of your images through a noise filter to get passable images is rather disappointing.  Especially when I think about the money I put out.Second is the EVF/LCD.  Neither of these gain up or down in high light/low light situations.  So shooting outside on really sunny days or at night is difficult at best.  I live in Oregon and like to go the beach and shoot pictures there and it is really difficult to do.  The Electronic Viewfinder is so low resolution that often times you can't really see what your shooting at.

Having owned more expensive Minolta, Canon and other film and digital SLR's, THIS is my favorite camera so far.  Why?  The short version ... I've never found it so easy to take such GREAT pictures so consistently ... and for so little money (I got this when the price was lower)!!  I was once the proud and happy owner of a Canon digital SLR that, with lens and associated gear, cost me around $5000.  I can honestly say this MUCH cheaper Panasonic blows my old Canon away and for less than 1/10th the money.  Pluses?1)  Light weight and easy to use.My arms used to ache after a long shoot with my Canon.  That big 2.8 lens was a beauty, but SO heavy.  I can shoot all day with the Lumix and feel just fine.  The controls are intuitive for me and easy to use.2)  Incredible Zoom RangeThe 12x optical zoom is AMAZING.  I've never had such lens reach, even with extenders, and the images taken with the lens zoomed fully out are crisp and clear and rich.  I LOVE this Leica lens.3)  Image StabilizationYes, it really helps ... zoomed out to 12x you need some help keeping things stable.  And the IS feature on this camera works like a charm.4)  ExposureI've never owned a camera of any type that made such consistently \"right on\" exposures using Automatic / Program modes.  Yes, it's nice to have all the manual mode options the Lumix offers for especially tricky situations.  But I've found that I can shoot 80% of my shots with this camera on Program mode and I'm VERY satisfied with the extremely high rate of first time successes.5)  Color Saturation and HueThe colors captured by this camera are consistently rich and right on target.  Not too blue or too red ... AND it allows you several different methods of adjusting the white balance if you wish to push it one direction or another for your own reasons.6)  Digital ZoomI've never been a big fan of digital zoom ...  \"If you're not zooming with the otpics of the lens, why bother\" I used to think.  Then, just for un, I pushed the Lumix past 12x to see how the digital zoom worked.  I was AMAZED at the image quality.  So ... if you need more than 12x ... it's there for you.7)  2.8 Aperture throughout Zoom RangeYes, it's true.  If you've ever paid $1500 or more for a lens with a 2.8 aperture available throughout the zoom range, you'll know what this feature is worth to you ... and this camera has it for so much less.  Being able to use the larger opening when zoomed all the way out is a HUGE plus.SUMMARYI've always wanted a light, easy to use camera with tons of zoom, delivering crisp, clear pictures, consistent great exposures without a lot of futzing, consistent good color satuation, quality white balance and lots of manual / menu selectable features for a reasonable price.  And THIS camera has fit the bill for me.  I'm SO happy.  I can heartily recommend this camera for anyone whose needs can be satisfied by a 5mp sensor.  And I agree with other reviewers of this camera ... it doesn't behave like a 5mp sensor ... much more like a 6 or 7.  If someone offered me a 6 or 7mp Canon or Nikon worth 10 times more in exchange for my Lumix ... I'd say \"no thanks\".  :)NOTE - I read another review here that mentioned that the owner experienced excessive noise in all his/her photographs, even at slower ISO's like 80.  All I can say is that my experience has been just the opposite.  Both my partner and I have shot thousands of shots on our FZ-20's and seen surprisingly little noise, even on very low light shots on ISO 400.  I've never owned a digital camera with so LITTLE noise.  I'm not sure what the problem was for this other reviewer, but I can assure you that neither my partner nor myself have experienced any such difficulty.", "Date": "June 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "W.

Because of the frequency with which I switch machines of all sorts, I make it a rule never to read manuals.  This camera holds its end and is ready to use out of the box with little instruction and logical controls.  It distinguishes itself with extremely fast shutter time and instantaneous time between shots even when not in fast frame mode.  You don't have to stand around and wait for the camera while your subject moves on to something else as you do with other digital cameras.  The 12x zoom works quite well.  Better still, because of the wide angle of the lense, close shots are happily in focus.  There is no need to back up to photograph subjects near to you.However, the camera lacks the software/chipware standard on most other digital cameras to make colors look true.  Colors look faded and washed out like they came out of an antique album.  Also, pictures are cast in the hue of the predominant item such that even skin looks purple if the subject is wearing a purple shirt.  This is something that one cannot fix well with software.  I have never had a camera with this problem before.  Moreover, there doesn't seem to be much consistency from picture to picture with the same settings in the same room as far as color goes such that one doesn't get a feeling of control over color.  \"Kodachrome, give me those nice bright colors.\"  I think I'll give this camera to my husband and move on.

The camera yes, and the fact that I should actually want to take a few minutes to praise it as well. Thanks to my wonderful wife giving me this as a Christmas gift, my well-used, 25 year old Minolta has been retired. As a rule I'm not easily impressed by \"new\" stuff, not particularly fascinated with the things of human genius. (After all, \"things\" are not even what we material-grubbing capitalists want to believe they are. They're the composite programming of so-called \"quarks and gluons\" resisting, for a given duration, the deprogramming effects of the electro-weak force and the second law of thermodynamics. Strangely ethereal stuff.) It invariably happens that today's latest and greatest techno-toy is tomorrow's techno-trash. While generations from now an idea or 'problem' thousands of years old might still be interesting and relevant, last year's cell phone might not even have a game station or a high-def camera in it, for-cryin-out-loud! (When will someone figure out how to include a digital cheese straightener?).So my perspective is not one from the bleeding edge of material technology-love. Other reviewers will offer more technological savvy, so if you're shopping for a new camera please pay close attention to what those people have to say. However, one need not be an expert to discern that this is an exceptional camera.Compare features and you'll wonder if the price isn't a mistake, especially if you shop around for the best price (which will probably be at an on-line technology merchant in Brooklyn). The 12x optical Leica lens alone should get your attention, no camera in this price range compares. The features are pretty much industry standard for higher-end cameras. The digital menus are extremely easy to navigate. It takes great pictures. And so it is that my judgment at last achieves a resonance with most of the technological experts: it's a beautiful thing, a great camera.", "Date": "January 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Everiting was great untill it stop working.", "Author": "Alberto Cid \"palapaquete\"", "ReviewID": "R2MXU8ATOYH4DG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera in July, and I was able to take many nice pictures.
