{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent dark performance!", "Author": "Robert Heron \"tech pro\"", "ReviewID": "RH61CZV724WIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera along with two of the Toshiba IK-6420A Analog Camera, 540 TV Lines, 24V AC and 12V DC cameras (non-Wide Dynamic).  The 65WDA is 2x the cost, but its ability to resolve detail in poor lighting is excellent.  Where the other cameras go muddy and dark, the extra sensitivity of the 65's sensors provided noise-free detail - even in dark areas that may contain a bright point (spotlight in operation).  For well-lit environments, you don't need this.  But if excellent, non-IR, low-light performance is what you want, this is an excellent 12VDC/24VAC auto-switching SD camera.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$562.50", "Features": "0.33-inch interline-transfer CCD image sensor CCTV camera\nFeatures wide 133-times dynamic range and dynamic shutter for clear pictures in incredibly dark or backlit conditions\nProvides resolution of 520 TV lines and an incredibly clean image with a S/N ratio of 53dB or better\nFeatures automatic backlight compensation, gain control, iris and shutter\nOperates on NTSC video format, runs on 24-VAC or 12-VDC power", "Name": "Toshiba IK-65WDA Analog Camera, 520 TV Lines, 24V AC and 12V DC, Wide Dynamic", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21CII7YNLIL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0006ZSPRO"}}
