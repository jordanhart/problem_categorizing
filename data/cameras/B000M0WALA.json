{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Can't beat it for PoE", "Author": "This Random Guy \"TRG\"", "ReviewID": "R2NXJ9FA63QN4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My boss wanted us to be an all-Cisco shop, but for a 50 person company and with less than ten employees in this remote office, with less than 50% projected growth y-o-y, it didn't make sense to pay Cisco prices. We're using this as a PoE switch to power a dozen VoIP phones.This switch works well, it has a clunky web interface like any other SMB market switch, but who spends much time with that, beyond first setup?Compared to the nearest Cisco, the Cisco SF200-24P Switch 24 10/100 Ports, Smart Switch, PoE, 2 Combo Mini-GBIC Ports, Warranty, One Year Tech Support - SLM224PTNA, this has more power per port, PoE on every port, and a higher max power output than any others I've found. And reasonaby priced. Fans weren't noticeable over the other server rack fans, admittedly not running at full PoE power.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "This switch is very buggy", "Author": "Gilbert Gutierrez", "ReviewID": "R32EIBP69KRWIU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "You would think that this switch would be very simple, and it should be. The software on the switch is very buggy specifically when it comes to DHCP.  I cannot get the switch to obtain an iP address and whats worse, I lose access when I do. Netgear knows that to be an issue and the latest firmware (5.0.2.33) on Netgear's web site is supposed to address this issue. I installed it with no success at resolution. I had to program a static IP into the device to allow myself to access the device. (When the device is in DHCP mode, the device is accessible by its default IP, but as soon as it sees a DHCP server access is lost and it does not get an IP or even request one.)I purchased this switch to simply power some PoE phones for a customer and while I was able to get this to work with some effort, I would not recommend this switch for anyone who has limited experience. Small offices that would tend to use this switch have flat networks and just need a simple switch to connect devices and in the case of a PoE switch power their devices. Why Netgear adds so much complication to their switch is beyond me because no large enterprise is going to buy this dud.The device I reviewed was a v2 version of the device. At this time, Netgear has software for a v1 and a v2.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything I needed it to be!", "Author": "George Warren", "ReviewID": "R1B3EUXPJI8SI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a techno, however, this switch is exactly what I needed to fix my failed switch made by 3Com.

York", "ReviewID": "R1NMATMRPYA3RG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have used these switches for our VoIP network in the office. We had a power even that knocked two out so I had to replace them. I was happy with the old units so I ordered the same model again. The old version was loud, it was the loudest unit in the rack, but these new ones are way quieter, as quiet as a PC. Overall this is a great POE switch that does what it is supposed to do. We ran the old ones for about 4 years with no issues, the only issue was because of the power even that knocked out almost everything on the network.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good switch but turtle-slow web interface", "Author": "B. Pearce", "ReviewID": "R9UM8OOMGT857", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With this, I was able to replace six 8-port switches and reduce clutter in my garage which serves as a hub for my network camera hobby.  18 of the 10/100 ports are in use, 14 of them using PoE, and 3 of the gigabit ports are in use.  No problems at all with connectivity or transfer speeds.  According to the web interface, I use about 50 watts of PoE during the day and just under 100 watts at night when all my cameras turn on their IR LEDs.The web interface uses a ridiculously slow web server.  When loading the administration pages, it can't seem to send faster than 10 KB/s and it appears to only allow one active network stream at a time.  This is connected via gigabit ethernet but the web interface pages load almost as slow as if they were hosted via dialup!  Minus one star for that.  Fortunately, the web interface isn't something I foresee needing to use very often.Coming from a consumer background where network switches are almost always silent, it is important to note that this one is not.  It has at least two fans and they are most definitely audible.  This isn't something you'd want to put in a room where silence is valued.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice product.", "Author": "hunter", "ReviewID": "R222FYVHNYOK5V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Set up in wireless WAP network and it works very well.

All Ports are POE", "Author": "nighthawkn117 \"nighthawkn117\"", "ReviewID": "R2LW0FTVH0YLWJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good Switch and priced right. The biggest advantage with this switch is that all 24 ports are POE. Most other switches in this price range only have 12 ports that are POE.So if you have a small environment that needs POE, then this guy will do the job. Its not a high end switch and doesn't have a ton of features, but still a great POE switch for the money from a reputable brand.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good switch", "Author": "RW", "ReviewID": "R39NKQ8OMX20IB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an urgent need to set up a test lab and didn't have thousands of dollars to spend on a Cisco switch.I was able to trunk a few VLAN's to my Cisco switch and even enabled 802.1x authentication on some of the ports and it worked well. Even though it's a 10/100 switch, it was nice to have some gigabit ports for uplink, and the ability to use SFP modules means that I could have used a fiber SFP module to use a Fiber uplink.I selected this switch because it has PoE on every port (many 24 port PoE switches only provide power on 12 ports), and the PoE worked well for me - I had a PoE device in nearly every port and it powered them all.I'll still use Cisco on my core infrastructure, but I was happy with the performance and configurabilty with this switch.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent for my avaya system", "Author": "J.

Hemmings", "ReviewID": "R1Q09KLG4WF5XC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With traffic on networks increasing and new devices being regularly added, you need a network switch that will not only cope with your current demmand, but will also be futureproof. The FS728TP does all that. With power over ethernet it can provide power to voice over IP phones on your network, remote webcams, etc therefore removing the need for local power sources for them.This really is a switch that suits all users - from the basic user this is effectively plug and play - just connect your devices and it works out of the box. With other more advanced features such as QoS, SNMP, Web based configuration & DHCP it offers plenty of configurability for the more advanced user as well.All in all, this is a great value for money switch with the performance and reliability that Netgear are known for. A highly recommended product!", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000M0WALA"}}
