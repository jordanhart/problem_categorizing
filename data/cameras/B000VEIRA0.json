I purchased this 2nd system to watch over my elderly parents who live on their own and refuse to go to an Assisted Living Facility.  I have checked into other monitoring systems but this one works for me.  Now Logitec does have a wireless model for around $299, but this older model which uses an ethernet cable still has the same functionality as the newer model - I just need to capture video and watch what is going LIVE from anywhere in the US.Reason why I love this system:>This system has FREE monitoring where some other companies charge a MONTHLY $$ Fee - so read the fine print if you decide to buy another system.>This system is easy to use and set up does not take more than 15min. anyone can do it as long as you read the instructions and you must be connected to the internet at \"all times\" to view LIVE video feed.>Since the camera plugs into any wall outlet you can move the camera from one room to another without any problems.> Just one suggestion buy a refurbished desktop with Windows XP and a cheap monitor just dedicated to the security system, so you will not tie up your personal computer that's what I did.  You can purchase a refurb desktop from Micro Center they are located in NY (Long Island and Yonkers - Westchester) and NJ or just go online and look for Micro Center they have plenty of Refurb desktops - it would run you around $200 - $300 for both plus $$ you need to add the cost for the Wilife Security System.  ****Make sure you check the computer requirements for the WiLife system you are going to purchase to make sure the desktop has enough memory and disk space.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for the price, some caveats", "Author": "Tech-Duke \"Tech-Duke\"", "ReviewID": "R1MCW0VJ2ADBNW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "5 stars because in this price range, it provides more than your money's worth. But it's not a super-deluxe system with lots of additional of features and capabilities. For that you must pay much more.I've been running a two-camera system (DVS-800i) for several years now and I must say, for me it has been much better than I expected. First, I had doubts about any product that was serious about communicating through AC power lines but I've only had to reset a camera a few times a year and, really, being cynical, I expected more problems. The reset worked for me in each case.If you really shop and think about a video surveillance system you quickly find there are some major decisions you must make. One big issue is installation time and cost. If you look at the competitor's fully dedicated wiring systems available (costing more) you realize that you must drill holes and run coaxial cabling for the camera to communicate, AND provide cabling for power to the camera - two wiring jobs. Once you've installed a wired system, you can't move it around very easily.Even if you choose a competitor's wireless system, you still need to provide power to the camera via wires. There are solar-powered outdoor cameras from other companies, but they are still early in their development. Additionally, you have to confirm that a clear and reliable wireless signal will always reach your receiver and if you are paranoid, you have to consider that wireless signals can be jammed by intruders.You will pay twice for a more feature-rich system from a competitor. First the purchase price of a more deluxe system itself will cost many times the cost of a WiLife system. Then you will pay again for the cabling installation. And when you want to add a camera or move an existing camera, you are facing cable installation costs again. If you can get a wireless system to meet all your needs, you may avoid the cabling, but when I made my comparisons, those systems still cost more for less features.With the WiLife system, you still have to power the camera but that very power line is also your transmission line so half the wiring problem is solved. It's relatively easy to move cameras and install new ones, provided that an AC outlet is within reach. I haven't needed AC extension cords, but I imagine they will work OK, they warn to avoid using power strips.So for the cost, the WiLife system offers a quick, easy solution and if it works for you, you have saved a lot of time and money. I won't go into comparing every feature, plenty of other reviewers have done that for similar WiLife products on Amazon.com, but I would like to say to some of the disappointed reviewers that they must be expecting the features of a much, much more expensive system. They should have checked their needs before they made the purchase. This is probably the best entry-level system with more capabilities than you'd expect for the price. It has been very stable and reliable for me but I would agree that in some locations, AC power data transmission may not work as well as expected. But try the WiLife system and see if it works for you.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor Product quality", "Author": "Phill", "ReviewID": "RD3LUP7YK9OQR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I rate this product as poor it looks that it is a used camera, the power supply is making a noise and the camera range is very limited", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$329.99", "Features": "Monitor up to six cameras simultaneously\nView live video from anywhere, anytime\nWindows Mobile cell phone accessible", "Name": "WiLife Indoor Camera Master System  DVS-800i", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Un3AVdZcL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000VEIRA0"}}
