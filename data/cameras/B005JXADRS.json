The sound came out perfectly, the sharpness of the back ground was great. The color came out beautiful. It's small fir perfect in my pants pocket, my handbag, it's awesome to have.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "bang for your buck", "Author": "david hazardous", "ReviewID": "R1SS67XQ8UODVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this gets five stars because i only paid like $20 because the flip out usb plug wouldn't stay in. i threaded a bolt into the tripod mount that holds the usb plug in, so if yours breaks, don't worry, it's an easy fix. actually, i would give this product five stars anyway, because it goes from off to shooting in about two seconds, and shoots awesome video for such a small camera. don't expect cinema quality, and it's terrible in low light, but what do you expect from a tiny sensor? want to see this camera in action? i shot the entirety of this music video (http://youtu.be/_1JuF_AJmN4) on it, as you can see, in VERY mixed light conditions. fresh!", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cool Camcorder!", "Author": "Robert Mitchell \"Rob Mitchell\"", "ReviewID": "R28AWH940R9VL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just took a chance when I bought this camcorder. And my sixth sense has come through again. This camcorder does everything I could expect. It records in HD and takes very good pictures as well as video. You can plug it directly to a HDTV via USB to HDMI cable.(Not Included). It is very easy to operate and make edits to your pictures and video. It has a micro sd card slot for more storage if you need it. This is great for making short or long videos. The picture quality is unmatched for this price range. Uploading to YouTube is a breeze on Mac or PC! The video quality is as good or better than a lot of camcorders that are much more expensive. One thing to take note is the size. It is pretty small and will fit in the palm of your hand. (Smaller than an iPhone). But what a punch this baby can deliver. I don't consider myself as a photography expert. But I do know how video should look and play when broadcasted. Clear with good sound! And that's what you get with this camcorder! Very happy I made the buy. I would recommend this to all amateur videographers! Especially just starting out! I got mine used on Amazon Warehouse Deals for $55! Listed in (Good Condition). It didn't have a scratch on it, and everything was included! Now how can you beat that? Thanks again Amazon! That's what's up!", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camcorder", "Author": "Macek", "ReviewID": "R38B6SRN2ID99F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My cannon camera died and I wanted to get something to capture photos and videos as well. I was also looking for something small in size and hand-ready since I have a baby and a toddler, and my video camera takes forever to turn on. This is a nice camera. The videos are good quality but it took me a while to figure out how not to have so many blurry pictures. I have to hold the button firmly for longer period of time. Overall, I am happy with it although my husband hates it.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stopped working in the first 2 days", "Author": "Airportkat", "ReviewID": "RZ3P5WP9FIHL0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is junk.  It stopped working in the first two days.  It wouldn't power up even with a fully charged battery.  The design also isn't great because when you plug it into a laptop or whatever, it has to support its own weight and it doesn't work well.  Neat idea...not a good product.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Had to send it back", "Author": "Thomas", "ReviewID": "R1AB4H7RDZCZYR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The battery lasted only 42 minutes the first full charge, then on next full charge went down to 24 minutes. I am sure that my experience is the exception because I have heard from others that the 2 hours of battery life is true for them. I really liked the camera and this defect is disappointing. The quality of the video wasn't as good as I have had on other cameras but that could be due to the battery defect also.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Adequate", "Author": "Peter J.
