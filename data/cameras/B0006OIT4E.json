I bought this camera on a whim. I took it out on the fourth of july and all the pictures/video i took with this are incredible. it's 4 mp so every pic is crisp and the colors aren't saturated. the video blew me away! it plays back clear and smooth, though you can't tell what the sound is really like until you listen to it on your computer or tv. I have about ten great/cute videos of all the fireworks last night... You also get nice features with this, such as night shots, portraits, sports, close ups, landscape... this is a refreshing change to my old, SLOW, featureless camera.", "Date": "July 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice overall good camera", "Author": "Brian J.

Most I've taken are blurry/fussy. Other than that, it is an OK camera.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "There have to be better cameras out there", "Author": "Oooh chimpanzee that", "ReviewID": "R2ZTTX2B2QN2JX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this camera a few years and used it sparingly. The rechargebale batteries that came with never keep a charge, so I started buying batteries. They did nto last long in this camera either.then, fo rno reason whatsoever, I get an error Camera Error #B03....see user's guide.After doing some research, this code pretty much means the camera is done. No fix for it as far as I know.I would definitely look for other cameras before buying this one.Also, I never did quite realize how much of a pain carrying around a bulky camera is. It is very bulky.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Kodak EasyShare CX 6445 - digital camera ( CX6445 )", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LZOyaSXRL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0006OIT4E"}}
