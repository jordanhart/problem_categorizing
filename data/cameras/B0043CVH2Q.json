{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great quality video but focus lags", "Author": "Zainul Charbiwala", "ReviewID": "R106RROA52YUYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a week now and have been loving it ever since. I've used another \"flip\" camcorder and the Bloggie Touch puts it to shame.Pros:1. Love the quick on and record. Great for spontaneous videos of the little one.2. The touch screen interface makes it both useful and fun to use the big screen.3. The still pictures come out brilliant, when the lighting and focus is good.4. The battery charges up super fast and stays with you for a whole day of shooting.5. The image stabilization is good. You can take decent video while walking around and panning too. Note that it is not optical, but electronic SteadyShot stabilization.6. The lens is very good quality and the pictures are crisp.7. Really like the \"snap picture while recording\" feature. I find myself using that feature the most. The video doesn't stall while the picture (full 12M resolution) is being taken and since the focus and exposure are usually locked well while you're in the middle of the video, the pictures come out great.Cons:1. In low lighting, there is quite a bit of graininess and using the digital zoom makes it much worse.2. While the lens is good quality, the auto-focus mechanism is really very slow. If you move around the camera too much before focus has locked on, the auto-focus will almost never lock.3. What I really miss with this camera is a flash. Even a tiny one would help with low light pictures.4. Minor annoyance: to preview a picture right after you take it, you have to go through at least two clicks. Sony could have designed it so that it always goes to the last picture taken by default, instead of the thumbnail list of all pictures/video on the device.I decided to purchase this camera over a still camera that can do video because:1. This one is dead simple. One button to turn on, one to take video and one to take stills. This makes it both easy and quick to use.2. This one can do 1080p video and 720p at 60fps.3. Its under $200 and is smaller than your phone.4. Its got internal flash and USB connector - no more SD cards or cables. 8GB is enough to get you through the day before you can come back to your laptop to dump the pictures.I decided to purchase this camera over other ones in the same category because:1. Its got a big display and the touch screen is fun to use.2. Its got a better lens system than the others.3. Its got (some) image stabilization.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow, wow, 1080! And so easy to use with the touch controls (pc and now apple compatible)", "Author": "Sincerely Yours", "ReviewID": "R2HM3WYB5D0JU0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well it almost seems like everything is now like an iPad! Operating this little device is definately one touch and not multi touch.  IT was fully charged when you switch on the device (that was a plus).  The packaging was beautiful and I thought I was getting a nice of piece of jewelry!This little camcorder/camera has a glass face that provides most of the functions with the exception of an one/off button, camera button and another button for start/stop video recording.  There is an initial set up prompt menu when you first start the device and a demo video that gets you all excited that you immediately want to play with it!Pros of this device1) camera provides photo size of 12megap, 8m, or 2m2) movie size 1080 (30p), 720 (60p), 720 (30p)3) camera self timer (2 or 10 minutes)4) zoom touch5) camera has a single face recognition6) delete and view of saved items very easy to navigate7) mini hdmi to allow view to television8) auto focus , not fastest response, but if panning slowly, it works great9) a USB that is neatly stored in body of camera10) allows for a mini tripod to be attached11) for each of the saved photo/movie youncan tag it to you tube, facebook, flickr, and prelabeled email addresses.12) the picture will rotate likemit is an iPhone/touch!13) volume adjust on playback is great and picks up voices very well.14) weighs less than iphone4Con: you have to buy a separate pouch!  Does get warm after using for half an hour continuously. This can only be used with windows and is not compatible to Mac!  Hmm, not good.( update as of February 2011, software is now available to Mac users to allow download to a MAC! Yeah)Also, wish there were some rubber gribs around the edge as it can get a little slippery to hold, but you do get use to it and adjust your grip to accomodate it.Results: even in low lighting, both the camera and camcorder recorded pretty good results.  The auto zoom will adjust from a moderate panning speed to avoid blurs.  We were quite impressed with how well the auto focus adjusted.Setting up the software was easy and detected the device immediately.  The picture is a little grainy whe using less than 12 megapixel, and the playback on the hd1080 (I, which is what we suspect) was actually not bad on our 46 inch tv!It is simple to use and I am usually the one that needs the manual and get over whelmed with the numerous functionalities.  It was very intuitive and really simple to use for the market it is aimed at: shooting fun footages to share with family and friends.Update: December 12th: in low light and indoor shoorting: the picture/video can come out with a tinge of yellow.  This result will happen if you shoot too quickly without allowing the camera to 'accumulate' a little more light.  The results are great for outdoors and very sharp finish (then again this is more for outdoor than indoor!  We are still loving how light it is and that with the touch screen you can move the focus and hold the Touch with one hand!", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Five star review for the Sony Bloggie Touch", "Author": "Ellie \"Eilean Siar\"", "ReviewID": "R1CKCDCQXEDBC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Consider this to be a rebuttal of the reviews of the Sony Bloggie Touch which were badly written by non-photographers, whiners, people who don't read camera manuals, people who don't understand that a camera needs, YES!, light ... Like flash? Get one of the thousands of cameras that feature automatic, built-in flash. Do you understand that a camera, even one with anti-shake features, must be held as motion-free as possible for best results, particularly in poor light? Video cameras don't use flash. Sorry, incorporating a video light on this camera would at least quadruple it's really handy size. Don't like the touch interface? Are you a Luddite? This is the most fantastic camera interface I have ever used. A touch interface like this is the main feature that makes the iPhone, Touch, and iPad so popular with tens of millions of people worldwide.The focusing is quite satisfactory - do you want a ring around the lens so you can focus yourself like twenty years ago? Do you think a very, very small form factor 1080p video/still camera which costs less than $160 with the touch interface making it the most easy-to-use camera of its type must do everything perfectly seeing that no camera is perfect regardless of price or class? I think the ergonomics are superb just as the iPod ergonomics are superb.I like my iPod Nano for the same reasons I admire the Sony Bloggie Touch design: small, elegant, easy interface, excellent performance within the design constraints imposed by current technology. Attach the wrist loop, hold the Bloggie as instructed in the PDF user manual (did you read that?), practice for 30 seconds and Voil\u00e0! Success. If you have a tripod so cheap it doesn't have a vertical flip capability, you have no right speak about tripod use.My use so far has shown the Bloggie Touch to be everything I hoped it would be in video and stills. I have numerous cameras including Nikon SLRs, Leicas, Fuji, and Canon from the days of film up to the present. Some photos I've posted online have gotten tens of thousands of views. I have been a press photographer. I love cameras and am inclined to say there are no bad cameras, only bad photographers. Having a camera with oneself and knowing how to use it with style and making use of its features, whatever they may be, is the mark of a photographer. You want quicker focus, get a Leica M9 and focus by hand. Get a Nikon D3 and a few thousands of dollars worth of lenses and other accessories to get the features you think the Bloggie Touch should have but doesn't.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "3 & 1/2 STARS: Nice camera with a few drawbacks...", "Author": "A.

The #1 being that if you hold it vertically, you get a lonely strip down the middle of the tv screen instead of a full screen video. I've been recording and playing with this video camera for days, and the only way to not have that was to make sure I started recording holding the camera horizontally. Imagine you're recording a once in a lifetime event, and later you realized you started holding the camera vertically, and the whole video is just a tiny strip down the middle of your tv. That's an \"oops!\" that will make you mad for a lifetime.#2: problem with the focus. I've had to do a lot of fiddling around to get it to attempt to focus on anything. Otherwise it would just continue to film unfocused, which is odd. I'm fine with a moment or two to get oriented, but it was just straight up not bothering.#3: I recorded some 1080 video, and it did not play well on my computer. So far I cannot get the sound/video to sync together which is very frustrating. I'm guessing this is all because my laptop is a couple years old and really not made to play 1080 video. So I think that setting will only turn out to be useful for watching on the tv. Otherwise for facebook uploads and online viewing, I'm going to record in 720 from now on.Otherwise, it's fairly easy to use, most of it is just common sense. Not too many buttons to get lost in. It will depend which way you're more comfortable holding the camera too, I like holding it vertically but for those horizontal people, this will work well for them. The plus side to holding it this way is that you'd also most likely use two hands, which will stabilize it and make your video less shaky.When you plug it in to a USB port, the software should automatically load. It was up and running in minutes. The software was simple with no good editing capabilities. When you take a video, you can check mark it to be uploaded to facebook, youtube etc when you plug it in, or just leave it alone and do whatever you like with it manually. The screen size is excellent, but you've got to be careful you don't hit it when you're just holding it since it is a touch screen. It would have been great if they included a little carrying case.Cute camera, easy to use, but my preference is still the flip.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible focus hunting problems and ergonomics", "Author": "dcJohn \"jwind\"", "ReviewID": "R1OO0LKHDA3OT5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted to like this camera, but it's been a complete disappointment. First and foremost, the automatic focusing is terrible. The image is often out of focus, and there's no way to tell the camera to try focusing again. (Why not add this and handle it like the iphone does? Just touch on the subject you want in focus.) Most portable video cameras like this (e.g. flip and kodak) have fixed focus, and I was looking forward to the Sony's ability to focus, since it helps get better macro shots. Instead, the camera is just constantly hunting for focus and often not getting it.The ergonomics are also a problem. I often want to hold the camera vertically, because it's more comfortable, but still take the usual landscape wide angle footage (again, like my flip and kodak cameras handle it). Instead, the Sony switches to verticle orientation when you hold it vertically. So, you've got to hold it sideways all the time, which isn't wildly comfortable for any length of time.Adding insult to injury, none of the useful tools for sharing footage online work with the mac (though it will import into imovie).The touch screen is nice and responsive and the video quality is good when it's in focus (though with the Sony's typical slightly colder color/white balance).

I wanted to get a pocket sized HD video camera for under $200 and I was considering this item to the Flip Mino and Flip Ultra.  I settled on this item over those two Flip cameras for the following reasons:1. Can record in 1080p.2. 3\" screen over 2\" screen.3. Can take still photos with Bloggie.  Cannot do this with Flip.4. Can record in 16:9 or 4:3.5. Bloggie has 4x digital zoom compared to 2x digital zoom for Flip.The biggest selling point for me is being able to record in 1080p.  It makes a difference if you are going to output to a TV (via HDMI) that can support 1080p.Now, I will say that the accessories for the Flip are much cooler but I wasn't shopping for accessories.Also, some people complain of the video quality in low-lighting.  Duh!  The Flip, Bloggie, Zi8 type cameras are not really designed for low light settings.  If you want a HD video recorder/camera that fits in your pocket, easy to use, has a nice wide screen, and takes great video for under $200 I strongly suggest the Bloggie.  If you want a HD video recorder/camera that is perfect for all situations in all sorts of lighting for under $200 you're not going to find it.Edit on 12/29/2010: I just learned today that while I can have over four hours of recording when using the 720p 30fps setting I cannot record continuously for over 30 minutes.  I'm still very pleased with the bloggie but the 30 minute time limit is a big disappointment.  If for example you do some kind of martial arts class and you want to set it on a stand and record the entire hour long class you will not be able to.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Does NOT record past 30 minutes at a time.", "Author": "ben23", "ReviewID": "R1L7VG5HDWO7KU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I tried this out at a concert and I was disappointed to find out that what I thought was recording was not recording because the camera will just stop if it's reached about 30 minutes -- don't know if the flip does this or other cameras but found this to be very annoying.  Also, like everyone else said, it sometimes takes forever to adjust and of course it's not good for long distance rendering the zoom pretty much useless.  Also, I guess the default is 720p -- not sure how to change it.  There is no power cord with this, but the way to charge it is through a usb charger which is included.  The drawback unlike the flip is that you can't just switch batteries, so you are kinda stuck after 4 hours.  I just got it, so still trying to see how it goes.  I like the 1080p and the 12 megapixel camera -- seems like a great combination which is the reason I chose this over the flip.*******Here is the response from sony:Depending on the camera, the recording time for each movie is limited to approximately 25-29 minutes and the maximum size of one movie file is 2 GB. Therefore, recording is automatically stopped when the file size reaches 2 GB or if 25-29 minutes of uninterrupted recording occurs.

On both counts, the Sony Bloggie delivers.PROS:- Great video quality- Easy to use- 12.8MP still camera- 1080p supported (as well as 720p)- Built-in USB port- Built-in mini-HDMI port- Attractive appearance- SteadyShot image stabilization (not optical)CONS:- Middling still photo quality- No optical stabilization- Hard to grip- No pouch or case included- Goofy name- Only digital zoomA couple of years ago, I bought one of the original Flip pocket camcorders from Costco. It was somewhat bulky, took standard definition video and ran on AA batteries. But we loved it as a family for being super simple, fairly cheap, and allowing us to capture spontaneous memories. We then upgraded to a Flip MinoHD but never had the same affection for it the way we did with our original Flip. I also had experience using the Creative Labs Vado and so I had a good sampling of what the pocket camcorder market offered. When I initially ordered the Sony Bloggie through Amazon's Vine Program, I was expecting a toy-like camcorder-- a My First Sony camcorder. I was wrong. The cutesy, youth-oriented name disguised the fact that the Bloggie Touch was a very capable, easy, and fun to use pocket camcorder.USABILITYEven if you haven't used a touch screen device before, the Bloggie Touch will be very easy to figure out. Once you get past the initial demo video, you'll be prompted to set the language, date, and time and then you'll be ready to shoot your first video. The large 3.0\" widescreen touch screen is fun to use and responsive. The itty bitty screens of the Flip or Vado were a bit of a chore to preview videos with but not so with the Bloggie Touch. There are just three physical buttons on the Bloggie- Power ON/OFF, Movie Button, and the still image shutter. That's it. All other functions and settings are are accessed through the touch screen. Though you can hold and record the Bloggie Touch in portrait or landscape orientations, keep in mind that it will be recorded in those orientations. Unlike the Flip or Vado, the Bloggie Touch is really meant to be used in landscape. The only problem I had with the Bloggie Touch was holding it correctly without it slipping out of my hands. The Bloggie Touch is very svelte and made out of slippery plastic. The front has a brushed finish while the side and back are a matte finish. Since you're supposed to hold it in landscape mode, it can be challenging to hold it with two hands without covering the lens with a finger from your left hand. It can be used with a single hand but since it's so slick, I felt the need to use both hands. Luckily, a wrist strap is provided.VIDEO QUALITYThe Bloggie Touch has three video recording settings-- 1080/30p, 720/60p, and 720/30p. I found that the 720/60p had the best balance of video quality and size. FYI, there is a 29 minute limit for continuous recording and a 2GB file size limit.  The Bloggie Touch uses Variable Bit Rate (VBR) format for video so the size and times of the video can differ depending on the type of video being recorded.  Below is the estimated recording times for each recording setting:1080/30p 1h20m720/60p 2h40m720/30p 4h00mIt performed very well outside in daylight. The autofocus actually worked really well. I should note that I immediately upgraded the firmware to v1.05 before I recorded a single video or took a single still. Firmware v1.05 is supposed to improve the format function, touch panel operation, and focusing. As I mentioned, I had no problems with focusing so perhaps some of the focus issues that the Bloggie Touch had initially were addressed in this upgrade. Indoors, it worked well for the most part, but as with most pocket camcorders, it struggled to keep up in low light. I did not expect any different.PHOTO QUALITYOutdoors, during daylight, the still shots that I took with the Bloggie Touch were rather good. Indoors, in good light, it was just ok and pretty awful in low light. The problem with still photos is that the Bloggie Touch does not have a flash so it's pretty useless indoors unless you have very good lighting. Except for the shots outdoors, I thought that my Droid X smartphone took as good a photo, if not better, than the Bloggie Touch. I was disappointed overall with the still pictures but still happy to at least have the option. In fact, you can take a still picture while recording a video.SOFTWAREI was never a big fan of the FlipShare software for Flip camcorders but did like it for it's ability to export videos and rename the files automatically by date. It was ok. The Sony software however seems to have no real added benefit other than organization and importing the videos from the Bloggie Touch to your computer. Yes, you can tag your videos and photos for automatic uploading but I don't personally find uploading my files to Facebook, Picasa, and others to be troubling to begin with. I suppose it would be decent for the super newbie. One feature I did like was the ability to trim videos, but that was about it.CONCLUSIONOf all the pocket camcorders I have owned and used, the Sony Bloggie Touch is probably the most fun and versatile. It's a little more challenging to hold because you have to hold it in landscape mode and is a bit slippery, but the nice 3.0\" touch screen makes up for it. If you already have a good HD pocket camcorder, I wouldn't say that the Bloggie Touch is worth switching to, but if don't already own one, the Sony Bloggie Touch is definitely worth a look.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Digital camera meets iPhone touchability", "Author": "A.M.Boughey \"Poetmaster\"", "ReviewID": "R10H2GZKSO36D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "3\" touchscreen is probably the biggest selling point of this very capable Sony mini cam / still cam combo, making controls, interaction and options as simple as a touch, on the very well lit and easy to use rear screen.Quick shoot capability with the \"hit the big button\" simplicity is also a plus when grappling for that perfect shot, still, or movie of often fleeting \"kodak moments\" that are harder to capture with high end, complicated equipment.8GB is pretty good internal memory as well, 2-4 hours of video, with up to 1080p resolution, in web friendly MP4 format. It even has included software for Facebook, and YouTube integration. It has a nice built in microphone with surprisingly good audio on the video takesNice and discreet, easily fits into any jacket or shirt pocket at just over 4\" x 2\" in size, and 0.6\" thick.The still camera is amazing, up to 12.8MP with great clarity, with a F/2.8 aperture range, it also tilts automatically when turning the camera between landscape and portrait, I like this personally, but agree with other reviews that an override would have been nice. I also noticed, as others have mentioned the auto focus can be a bit of a bear at times, but  I didn't consider it a deal breaker.No viewfinder (obviously) as everything is done through the touchscreen, which is pretty easy to see, even in direct sunlight.Unfortunately no flash, so low lighting shots and video are grainy. Why no flash? You ask, well I would imagine that this would eat the battery life at such a rate, it would spend more time on charge, than in your pocket. I did knock off a star for this, as there were times when a flash would have been great for still images, but you can't have everything I suppose.Prior to this I owned one of the cheaper Flip Video's, which although it was adequate, was a world removed from this for picture quality, video resolution, and build quality. Something I am pleased to see seems to still be reliable with the SONY brand.Overall 4 stars. A great multi function camera.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty good if you need a dedicated camera", "Author": "Raj", "ReviewID": "R2NABZ9DWBEV0S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I like it, though I'm beginning to really question why I need a dedicated camera when the newer smart phones take such great video and photos. I don't know that it performs that much better than my iPhone 4 that it's worth carrying a separate device. That said, if you don't have an Android or iPhone, and want a dedicated device, this is a good one.Pros:- Video quality is crisp and clear- Records at 60 frames per second, which gives the videos a very smooth look when you're panning or changing focus- Dedicated buttons for taking a picture and recording video- Sturdy construction- HDMI outCons:- Touch screen is very laggy- UI is not straight forward.

These issues could likely be fixed in software so let's hope Sony puts in the effort. In an age of iPhones, Google, and Twitter, I don't understand how a manufacturer can address ergonomics and user interface so carelessly.1. The ergonomics are terrible for video. One must always hold the camera sideways for a true full screen wide shot. This is uncomfortable, and because of the microphone placement, often your finger ends up covering or making noise at the mic. Holding the camera vertically (like the Flip) switches the record mode to a portrait with black bars on the sides--I can't imagine why anyone would ever want to record this way.Sony should get rid of the portrait video mode and make it always widescreen no matter how you hold the camera--or at least make it an option.2. The PC software seems like an afterthought with regards to editing videos. You can trim the front and back ends of a video, but can only play from the top. If you want to edit the end, you either have to watch the whole thing, or \"pretend\" to trim the beginning so that the playback point is closer to the end, then move the top trim back before you make the edit.Otherwise, the video and sound quality is very good, the camera is fast to power and instantly record. The inclusion of 3 video formats is very cool.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Class, elegance, simplicity, and lousy software.", "Author": "Just Trying to Help", "ReviewID": "R2P1TRHVLAY123", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very pleased with the bloggie overall.There are 3 basic parts of this review:1) hardware - of course, thats what you see in the picture2) software - we increasingly get software with the hardware which affects our experience, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.3) Accessories - With this product you could use someI have used the Flip Mino and this unit is superior.  While the name \"bloggie\" is somewhat whimsical and even a bit lame, this product has several hints of luxury.  The first one is evident when you get the bloggie and open the box.  Its reminiscent of iPhone packaging.  In fact, as you can see by the picture it arrives in a \"presentation style\" box, suitable for gifting.  Whether you buy this for yourself or for someone else you will feel that it is a bit of a treat to open.Picture quality:  outdoors the picture quality is extremely good.  I have owned many Sony cameras, as well as Canon and Fuji.  this one takes excellent pictures FOR WHAT IT IS.  Don't expect DSLR results.  The outdoor shots are excellent.  Indoors is another matter.  I found that the camera had difficulty with the auto-white balance.  I found myself wishing I could just hold up a piece of white paper and white balance it manually (the old way).  For those of you who aren't camera buffs, white balancing is when you tell a video camera what \"white\" is so all the colors will be natural.  Anyway, the point is that indoor pictures are often off-color and a bit grainy.  There IS NO FLASH.  Thats not abnormal for this kind of camera.  Certainly a flash would help significantly, but if you are comparing it to similar pocket video cameras you will not be surprised by this omission.Controls are incredibly simple.  Sony seems to have gone to great effort to keep it simple.To charge the camera, you simply plug it in to a USB port.  USB ports are ubiquitous these days, and so you can charge it many places.  In fact, you can buy a cheap generic car charger to charge it in your automobile, like this one: Apple iPod USB Travel Kit with Car Charger/ Travel Adapter/ Cable - WhiteI haven't used this particular one, but the one I have is similar quality and is no longer available on Amazon.  There are actually many of these to choose from.  This one gives you a wall charger and a car charger for cheap.  So I'm very happy that you can have multiple charge options cheaply.  If you are buying this as a gift for someone consider including a car/wall USB charger.Another nice feature this product has is the HDMI out, however, it is a mini HDMI.  I purchased this adapter: HDmi Cable Adapter Hdmi To Mini Hdmi Cable Adapter for m.  Its easy to put in a sock with the camera, and you can probably find an HDMI cable you can use at any of your friend's houses.The software is a bit of a downer.  I downloaded the software from the camera.  The software was slow.  The benefit of being able to upload to facebook easily was lost on me because it took me a long time to weed through all the videos I took.  I don't want to share lots of videos on facebook, just a couple of the best ones.  Another thing I noticed is that video playback was choppy in the Bloggie software.  it was also choppy in Picasa.  But the videos played back perfectly on the camera, in Windows Media Player, and through the TV.  it was irritating to not have the movies play correctly on some software.  I wonder if this could be fixed somehow, or perhaps I didn't have a setting correct, but the camera should work \"out of the box\" with its own software.Overall, i have to say I really love the camera.  It is best for people who like to take a lot of outdoors footage.  its not so good for indoor use but the small size of the camera means that I would take the camera more places and use it more often and capture more of life's joys.  Even without a flash.It has a lot of elegance and simplicity which are things that I prize in a device.  I would be happy to give or receive this device, mostly because you don't HAVE to use the bloggie software that is included.

I still can't get over the breathtaking pictures that this little guy is capable of producing! The photos taken by my Boggie Touch are comparable to that of my $300 digital still camera!!!Another feature that I like about this particular camera is the fact that it has built in memory. Something that is rare for cameras at this price point! The 8GB of memory allows for a total of 4 hours of HD video recording! This also means that I don't have to fool around with SD cards, or worse, MICRO SD cards! LOLLast but not least, I love the simplicity! I really love the simple ease of use when operating this camera. The menus are very easy to navigate and the touchscreen is very responsive.Things that I didn't like:The only real con that I found with this camera is it's poor automatic focusing ability.

The video sample was shot on a very overcast day at a ski hill.  Minimal controls, everything except the start and stop is done via the touch screen. Still photos are good quality, and the digital zoom is surprisingly detailed.  Light weight, compact, and pretty rugged. The case is aluminum - I'm not saying it will survive a drop on concrete, but on grass or snow, no problem. The included software is in the camera, and is accessed like a USB drive.  I installed it on Win 7 Ultimate, but it would not run. So I un-installed it. No idea what it does or why you need it.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my lil Bloggie!", "Author": "patskywriter", "ReviewID": "R1HBNZKLI4MAF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't think I really need to say how much I LOVE my Bloggie--so many people have already said that. However, I will address some of the criticisms (which were indeed accurate). I'm simply offering some workarounds:Someone mentioned that the Bloggie gets a little slippery when you're holding it for a long time. You can buy a soft plastic case for a couple of bucks. That could help. Someone else lamented the fact that the Bloggie doesn't come with a flash. My solution actually solves BOTH problems: I bought a LightLINK rechargeble camera light. It's a 2-inch-square multi-LED light that comes with an L-shaped bracket that attaches to your Bloggie via the tripod screw (it's right next to the USB jack). How cool is that?! I bought it on Amazon.com and it was only $25. You'll find that your video work will be much steadier because you're holding the bracket, which is so much easier than holding the camera. (LightLINK Rechargeable Ultra-Bright LED Camera Light for Flip UltraHD , Sony Bloggie Touch , Kodak PlaySport and Other Pocket Camcorders with Mini Tripod) After you get this LED light, you'll probably notice that shining it directly into people's faces is rude. The light it produces is wonderfully white, but too bright for close-up interviews. I bought a bit of translucent white fabric, doubled it up, and made a light diffuser.Keep in mind that you'll probably want to protect the glass. I found a great little case for $1 at the dollar store. I slip the Bloggie into the case and then into a small shoulder bag, where I keep the AC cord, car charger, lens cloth, LED light and bracket, and notebook and pen (I'm a journalist).Another item I bought was a double L-shaped bracket, which allows me to attach the Bloggie to a standard tripod. Unfortunately, the tripod screw is positioned so that your Bloggie is in portrait instead of landscape mode. The double L bracket fixes that problem. I also got that on Amazon.com, and it was only $7. When searching for brackets made specifically for cameras, the ones I found cost around $100! (Double L-shaped Bracket Holder Mount for Camera & Speedlite Flash)I bought my Bloggie to make short videos, and I think it's great! Once you learn how to \"work with what you've got,\" as my dad used to say, you'll find that working with a Bloggie is a real pleasure.  :)", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice little camcorder", "Author": "S. Flanagan", "ReviewID": "R1T1ALOLRWK9XV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camcorder to replace my 2 year old Flip camcorder. The Flip was so easy to use and the pictures were good but sharing them and transferring them to DVD was a pain. The screen finally cracked and I was having a hard time uploading to my computer so it was time for a new camcorder.I checked out different camcorders on line and then went to Best Buy to look at them physically. The Kodak camcorder was very nice and easy to use but I know they are no longer manufacturing camcorders and I didn't want to get into the same problem I had with the Flip, the manufacturer is out of the business, so I checked out the Bloggie. Amazon had the best pricing and with my Prime membership I was able to get it quickly. Out of the box it is charged partially which was good. The bad news, there is no owners manual that comes with the unit, you need to get it from the camcorder itself, which to me is not great. The pictures come out great and the sound is ok. Once I figured out how to share privately I was up and running. And unlike the Flip which had it's own clumsy software for playing the movie, these can be stored in your regular windows files which will make them much easier to convert to DVDs.I did get an AC adapter because I am not sure how long the battery will last and I may not have my computer with to charge it up. But otherwise, you really don't need to purchase anything. I thought I would like a camcorder with an SC card but with 4gb memory this should be fine.Really like this camcorder. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally done shooting videos with my phone!", "Author": "Fryeguy", "ReviewID": "R1ALGYMIVV6Z3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been shooting video with my HTC Evo with an 8mp lens and my Sony Cybershot W330 with a 14mp lens and the Bloggie puts them both to absolute shame.  I've finally realized a phone's a phone & a camera's a camera so I encourage you to do the same.  The cell phone makers have done an excellent job fooling everyone into thinking their IPhones and Droids can do it all but it's just not true no matter how many megapixels they have or how advanced they claim they are.  They'll get there someday but they're not there yet.As for performace, beyond my expectations.  Now, if you want a professional camcorder, buy one.  It'll cost you at least 4 or 5 times as much but you won't have much to complain about anymore.  If you want a significantly better video experience than your cell or digital camera, the Bloggie is awesome.  Not only does it outperform every other compact out there (Kodak, Samsung, Flip), it does better than a lot of actual camcorders in the $500 or less category.  With adequate lighting, the crispness & clarity is stunning & videos look great on my Mac, PC, & big screen.  No it doesn't have a flash or a video light, no it doesn't take the greatest pictures, no it doesn't have an optical zoom (for a digital zoom, it's actually quite nice).  You have to remember the price point & remember that it's a camcorder 1st, & a camera 2nd.  My suggestion is use your digital camera to take pictures, or your phone if you have to as long as it has at least 8mp.  Turn the lights on if you're shooting video in the dark or just deal with it if you can't.  The Bloggie actually does very well in the dark in comparison to cell phones & it's competitors so I have no complaints.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Image Stabilization",

nicest for quality video. One issue I have with taking video is shaky results. Most image stabilization on camera's doesn't really work that great, this Bloggie works great. The best video I've ever taken. Extremely effect image stabilization. Excellent photos and video. And these camera's work GREAT with the iMac. Plugging in the camera to the iMac usb port or extension USB cable, iPhoto pops up with this camera, the Bloggie, as the devices attached. Then simply import your photos and video into iPhoto. So simple. Battery life is great. After a week my Bloggie still shows full charge. I returned the HSN purchase and bought the Bloggie from Amazon just to get the 8GB 4 hour version for near the same price as the lesser 4GB bloggie at HSN. Forget HSN, get the better version from Amazon for a few dollars more. Great image stabilization, long battery life, mac and iPhoto support. No need to install and further 3rd party software. Plus, the HD video is easily editable using the mac iMovie software. This camera was made for the iMac. And for people that tend to take shaky video, this is the best solution for smooth perfect video.

picture gets a little fuzzy with every movement and always seems to be trying to autofocus.  So far that's the most irritating thing I've encountered while using the Sony Bloggie, but here is a more in-depth run-down of my pros and cons:The Good:- Breath-taking picture quality.  Anybody can make their own Earth documentary with this thing, the picture is SO clear.  It's glossy and detailed and just utterly mind-blowing.- Touch Screen. this will actually appear on a \"bad\" list as well for zooming, but for messing around with settings and options the touch screen is very handy.- Still pictures.  The Bloggie is an upgrade for me from my previous video camera, the Flip MinoHD, and so I was quite thrilled to see that Sony's camera can take phenomenal still shots in quality as high as 12mp.  There's also a self timer function, which is always handy.- Tri-pod slot.  I'm pretty sure all camera have these, but it's nice to know this one does too.  I bought a little Flip Video Tripod and it screws in nicely and keeps the camera steady in just about any location.-Pop-out USB.  These make me nervous, but they certainly are handy.  The USB connector pops out of the camera itself so it's always ready for connecting to a computer.  No worries about losing wires or forgetting to bring them.-HDMI output.  This is amazingly handy for a quick connection to your 1080p television.  All you need is a Gold-Plated Advanced High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet (6 feet) and you can connect it to your TV through an HDMI slot.  This is a great way to actually see what you recorded instead of loading it onto a computer and then viewing it.  Plus, the video looks A M A Z I N G on a 1080p television screen.- Easy function.  Anybody can use this camera, it's very simple and bare bones.  You point and shoot.  There's nothing really fancy about it.  For some people that's probably a down side, but since I'm not a professional movie director I think it's kinda nice.-Memory.  8gb is a shockingly large amount of space and provides enough room for a good two hours of true 1080p footage, even more if you choose to film in lower HD (720p) - up to 4 hours, they claim.-Battery Life.  Even after playing around with it for hours, recording most of that time, the battery is still going so I can't complain about how long the juice lasts when you start on a full tank.The Bad/Mediocre:The Autofocus.  Pretty much everytime you move the camera it's going to need to do a little autofocusing.  Depending on the depth of the new object it's looking at, this could take half a second or three or four or more.  It is beyond frustrating.  Not just because for a time the picture is fuzzy, but because you have to sit and watch the camera think and then watch this zoom in/out business while it regains focus.  Once it has focus, however, it REALLY has focus and every little detail sparkles with high definition.  So if you plan on recording something with the camera remaining very still it should be perfect... otherwise, be prepared for some focusing issues.Sound quality.  I wouldn't call the sound \"bad\" and maybe \"mediocre\" is even a little harsh because it is good given the size and shape of the camera, but when you compare it to the picture quality it's not so magnificent.  I know the purpose of this camera is convenience, no ordinary person wants to attach big Hollywood microphones to a little camera, but just be aware that some sounds may be a little high pitched and some will be soft while others startlingly loud.  Nevertheless, I think it's very satisfactory for home use.Zoom.  Pretty much worthless, I would not recommend using the zoom feature because it distorts the picture and isn't really that impressive.  As you can tell from my video, once I zoom is everything gets very fuzzy.  Additionally, it's very difficult to smoothly zoom with the touch screen feature because it either under-reacts or over-reacts to touch, and you have to jeopardize the steadiness of the camera to do it.Software.  The software it comes with is not bad for beginner film editors, but for anybody looking to do a little more I would suggest sticking to whatever software you are already familiar with.--------Overall, for $150 this is a fantastic latest-greatest gadget in the realm of home video cameras.  The picture quality is so so so incredibly amazing that watching it actually makes it feel like you are back in the moment.  The autofocus is irksome and with the way home video cameras continue to evolve and upgrade, there May be better option out there or in the near future, but to be honest it isn't THAT annoying.  After getting used to it for a while I managed to understand how to move the camera around so the autofocus didn't intrude too much, and if you're not interested in being overly professional it's hardly a worry.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product !", "Author": "michele harman", "ReviewID": "R1EPWLGHX4JTNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was really impressed how small it was .Feels good in the hands ,great video quality.We have a Flip HD Ultra and I would say that the Sony Bloggie blows it out the water.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Depends of Price", "Author": "Dan D.", "ReviewID": "R1HCZ4EVMFBMAG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this as a video camcorder/camera I can easily keep in my pocket to capture the unexpected.

After a few days of using it, we were amazed.  It is a very sleek, cool looking camera and is capable of giving very good quality videos.  However, after using it for about a month, we wound up taking it back and getting a flip.  Here are my findings:1. ERGONOMICS.  This camera is very slim and light.  I didn't have much trouble with it, but my wife hated it.  It is sleek and very cool looking, but she just hated the way it felt in her hand.  She constantly complained that she couldn't handle it well.  I guess it was too slim for her to get a good hold on it.  I'll admit the flip is easier to hold being quite a bit fatter.  I kinda figured the whole point of getting this type of camera was to have something compact and sleek, but you might want to consider what your preference is.  Again, I didn't have a problem with holding this thing and using it.2. LIGHT.  It does fiarly well with handling light.  It can shoot in the sun beautifully.  In an average lit room with incandescent or fluorescent lighting, it did well with a slight loss of color in dimly lit rooms.  With a backlit subject, like my kid running around the living room with a window behind him with sun coming in, it was horrible, which is not too unusual for most cameras in this price range.3. FOCUS.  The first day we got this camera, we were pleased to see the green box show up around my son's face.  It had identified his face and was trying to focus on him.  However, after a few days of use, we realized that box didn't come up too often, and dissappeared quickly when it did show up.  As soon as my son would move, it would focus on something else, then go completely out of focus and have great difficulty getting back in focus.  We tried and tried, and found this to be the norm.  After about a month with this camera we gave up.  This was the reason we eventually took this camera back and got something else.Basically, if you are shooting video of something that doesn't move and is at least descently lit, this is an awesome camera.  I plugged the bloggie into my 46\" sony bravia and was amazed (Costco sells it with the HDMI cable included).  The video quality is far superior to the flip.  The video quality can rival some much more expensive camcorders, when it is in focus.  However, if you are shooting video of anything that may move, this camera just isn't that practiacal.Although I was very interested in looking at the Kodak playsport, my wife wanted the flip and we never looked at the Kodak.  I suspect the Kodak may have been our best option in this class of camera.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent with three very annoying traits -UPDATED", "Author": "DirtRider \"I like to play in the dirt\"", "ReviewID": "R2JN5C83866MVJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The video with the stabilizer is fantastic however, it takes a while for it to focus which is annoying.

I got used to not doing that but it does happen from time to time. You hear your hand shifting around it. That's #2When you record the video, it will set either landscape or portrait depending on how you are holding it which can get annoying.  It should have a setting for a default set up which never changes. Maybe there is one but I can't find it.

I charged it and was using it immediately.ProsI have primarily used the bloggie for short videos and find it completely simple and intuitive to use.  The commands and icons on the touch screen are straight forward and I figured them out by just clicking on them.  I like the touch screen, it has a similar responsiveness to smart phones.Starting up and taking a video or a picture is very easy.  The bloggie boots up quickly so if I want to snap a picture or start a video, I can do it in seconds.  That is big.I like the fact that I can be doing a video and can snap a picture while videoing.ConsI have noticed that the focusing on the bloggie can be slow (as a number of reviewers have bashed the unit for).  This is noticeable to me but not a show stopper.As obvious as it should be it took a few times for this to click with me... the orientation of the image is based on how I am holding the bloggie.  If I am holding it vertically (which for me is the most comfortable hand position) it is taking a vertical wide-screen (9:16 instead of 16:9)...  if I turn the bloggie on the side it takes a normal wide-screen.  I haven't dug into the settings yet to see if I can change this, wouldn't surprise me if I could be changed there are plenty of settings with this item.At one point, the screen froze up and by holding the power button for 5 or so seconds, it shut down and restarted fine.SummaryI've tried to list positives and negatives and have deducted a star for negatives.

Firstly, the on screen zoom feature isn't very easy to use and is very jerky. It might be a better idea to have physical zoom toggle thats more like a real camera. Secondly, I don't understand why the bloggie does not have a built in flash for the camera, even most cell phones have a flash built in these days. My last complaint about the Bloggie is the software - it's a bit clunky. I found it easier and faster to use just Windows 7 to extract the videos.Now to the things that I think the bloggie does well. It takes some really good video, especially if you are in a well lighted setting. The still picture quality is pretty good as well.I would recommend this camera if you like taking a lot of video clips of kids playing at home etc. I was doing a lot of that on my phone but the video quality left much to be desired.

Not overly sensitive where your accidentally  pressing commands when you don't mean to. But definitely does what you want it to when you do want it to do something.Menu is extremely user friendly and easy to learn. Within 10 minutes of playing around with it, you can totally understand how to use each of the features and feel comfortable with them.Ability to take both pictures and videos with the camera in either the horizontal or vertical position.  Simply turn the camera and it automatically changes modes.Sleek, compact design with a touch screen that does a good job of minimizing finger smudges. Small enough to slide into the smallest of pockets, yet takes high quality videos like it's larger counterparts.Separate buttons for picture and video recording. The recording button in the large circular button in the center of the Bloggie, the button to snap a picture sits on the side of the camera. This helps a lot to make sure your in the mode you want to be, and not taking video when your trying to take a still picture.Turns on fast! The Bloggie is on in just a few seconds and ready to take pictures and video.  This makes it  much more convenient for recording those unexpected moments.The not so good:The Bloggie does not do well taking digital pictures in low light. In a typical indoor setting with household lights, it's still too dark sometimes. I find myself wishing it had a flash all the time while taking pictures. You seem to need either natural light or florescent light to take a decent still photo. The recording feature definitely seems to do better in low light situations.A little slow to focus in recording mode. You can definitely see the Bloggie trying to focus as your recording.  The better the lighting conditions, the less the focusing seems to be an issue. We took a video while out ice fishing and when going from inside an ice shack (dim light) to outside on a very bright and sunny day, there was a significant focusing time for the camera. Seemed to take about 5+ seconds before the camera was able to come out of the blur and focus on the lake.Final thoughts:While it's not perfect, it's a great little camera. I own this and the Kodak Play Touch (also takes, pictures and records) , and the while the Bloggie's picture quality in low light is not the best, in total it still takes better photos, as the image stabilization in the Kodak is not nearly as good. I end up with a lot more blurry photos with my Kodak, where the Bloggie takes clear photos that can come out a little dark in low light. Also the menus in the Bloggie are much more friendly and the video I have taken with the Bloggie has been brighter and cleaner looking than with my Kodak.

Never had a camera that could do that before! So it was really easy to just grab and go - anyone seeing it would just think it was a cell phone.I also agree with other reviews about the grainy images when in low light conditions.  In my opinion, the videos also looked a bit \"soft\"; not much sharpness in recorded details.  At times I believe the antishake processing was noticeable in some of the recording as well (subtle shifting of the subjects within the frame for example.)The issue that made me return the camera is the fact when you turn the camera vertically, the camera records in a vertical mode WASTING all the space around the video with a black border!  There isn't even an option to turn this off!On playback you get this terribly small \"postage stamp\" of your recording in the middle surrounded by a sea of black border!Ultimately I found myself holding the camera horizontally pressing record to START the recording and then rotating the camera back vertically, which would keep the horizontal orientation for the remainder of the recording. (I then rotate my videos back in post using my editing software.)Didn't have this problem with the PlaySport which maintains a horizontal orientation.For now, I've sort of settled on a Canon 4000is which is blazing fast at snapping pictures (8.4 fps in the burst mode, nearly 4 fps in Program mode which is amazing to me coming from other Canon pocket cams that could barely snap at 2 fps.  Video is 1280x720 30 fps but I'd still prefer 60 fps.  Low light is the best I've had to date using a Canon snap camera; 85+% of my snaps come out clear with this camera compared to all my older ones!)I'd still like a pocket camcorder so I plan on evaluating the Sanyo VPC-PD2BK later this week - to perhaps go along with my 4000is which is a definite keeper for me.I still somewhat like the Bloggie though, it's a sleek, great gift camera for perhaps someone that rarely takes pictures / video and not looking for as much perfection as possible from the camera they use.With a software update to lock the video orientation (or remove that vertical mode altogether), I could see using the camera again for myself or perhaps recommending it more to friends and family.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Benjamin", "ReviewID": "R39ZR007I4KXYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Id like to have ten of these.

Connects to laptop through built in USB for viewing and charging.  Software is pre-loaded and self-installs.Took pictures and video indoors and outdoors on rainy, cloudy and sunny days. Convenient. Zoom works well for stills.Played back very well on both my laptop and, even, more vivid, on 1080p TV with the HDMI connection.Stills grainy through HDMI, but perfect through USB connection.Very compact and lightweight.Pretty quick charge through USB connected to laptop or car charger.Easy to adjust video and still image quality with several options available, right through the touchscreen.NEGATIVES:Does not perform too well under poor lighting conditions.No flash.  Requires special HDMI cable (standard Type A to Type C cable) to hook-up to HDTV.Takes a second or so to auto focus when moving across objects far and near. Improved auto focus with Firmware upgrade.Not so great zooming while shooting for focus. Touchscreen not the most convenient for zooming either while shooting. Best NOT to zoom while shooting video.Upgraded to v1.05 which improves touchscreen and autofocus, BUT NOISY shooting video in 1080p due to \"constant autofocus adjustment\". No problems shooting 720p, still providing excellent video quality through HDMI.SHARING WHILE TRAVELING:Simple YouTube and Facebook uploads through included Bloggie software.RECOMMENDATION:Case to protect camera.

Mills \"FaultyDrive Admin\"", "ReviewID": "R1FDY9A3GB3IDQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I got my Bloggie HD Touch 8GB, I only had a few minor issues with it.  *The focus was sluggish and inaccurate.  *The touch interface was irritatingly inaccurate.Both of these issues were fixed with the 1.5 firmware update which can be downloaded from Sony's website for free.  With those issues out of the way, I tried to install the Bloggie software on my laptop.  I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit (a supported OS) and had nothing but trouble installing this software.When the Setup_Bloggie.exe application was run, I encountered Javascript errors which prevented me from installing the Bloggie software on my computer.  Being a systems administrator, I tracked down the javascript file that was being run by this program and attempted to bypass the Setup_Bloggie.exe program altogether.  I found the install program and went to run it manually.  The install only got about 60% of the way before failing because it was missing files.  I ran back through the code and found that a few files seemed to be missing.At this point I contacted Sony's customer support (people you would expect to be at least moderately technical) to see if they could send me a link to a new version of the Bloggie Software.  After an hour and a half with customer service, I had lost my patience and received no help at all.  I would go 15 minutes without any kind of response (This was over their online support chat client) and in the end he kept telling me to read the manual (which simply told me to run Setup_Bloggie.exe).  When I finally asked to speak to a manager or an engineer, he told me I should contact a different department.  Rather than transfer me himself, he wanted me to call back later.After a little while longer, I did manage to install the Bloggie Software on my own, but still cannot get it to function correctly.  If you receive error messages when attempting to install the software, try the following:Please remember that I am a very experienced user.  I would NOT recommend that anyone try this if they are not comfortable getting their hands dirty so to speak.  Instead, I would recommend that we all push for Sony to release some software that works.  I am not responsible for anything that may happen to your computer if you attempt this procedure.  1.) Go to the \"Start\" Menu and open the \"Control Panel\".  2.) Click on \"Folder Options\".  3.) In the new window, click on the \"View\" tab along the top bar.  4.) Scroll down until you see \"Hidden Files and Folders\".  Click \"Show Hidden Files, Folders, and Drives\" underneath this item.  5.) Click \"Apply\"  (Leave this window open.  It is a good idea to click \"Don't Show Hidden Files, Folders, or Drives\" as soon as you finish this process.  6.) Open \"My Computer\" or \"Computer\".  7.) Find \"Bloggie Software (J:)\" along the left hand bar.  8.) Open the \"conf\" folder.  9.) Scroll down until you see \"Setup\" or \"Setup.exe\".  10.) Right-click on this item and select \"Troubleshoot Compatibility\"  11.) In the new window that opens, click \"Start the Program...\".This will install the program.  However, even after installing and updating the software, the software will STILL not recognize my Bloggie.  I still cannot synch my camera with my computer.Note that the updates require this same procedure, but you first have to find the updated software files (The same files that Sony would not provide me earlier) in your C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\" directory.  Mine was titled 1293649297.  Finding it was fun.As for the camera itself, I found it to be a bit lacking in color saturation and contrast.  Everything seemed a bit flat.  Then again, I couldn't get Sony's software to work properly, so there may be something in there that can correct these issues.All in all, I like the Bloggie HD for what it is.  It's a (relatively) cheap, pocket video camera.  I wouldn't use it to shoot anything serious, but it's great for those times when your boss takes you to a \"unique\" restaurant and the food is still moving.

Video quality is pretty darn nice, very clear with alot of light needed because this bloggie has no flash or light of its own. Sound quality is very low. When you replay you can barely hear sound. Once its connect to your HDTV you can raise the volume, so problem fixed there. The picture quality connected to the Sony Bravia TV is excellent.

Its lack of a flash is such a ridiculous oversight, I felt compelled to read others' reviews just to be certain I wasn't crazy.  Others have pointed this out too.I had been using a years-old Sony Cybershot, and I would occasionally take stills (with flash) on my Sony HDD camcorder.  I had hoped that the Bloggie Touch would replace them both as a small and stylish alternative, giving me the ability to shoot HD video from a device the size of my iPhone.  And outdoors, it's remarkably convenient.  Whereas on a vacation to, say, Walt Disney World, I would have the bulky Cybershot on a strap on one arm with the camcorder in its own bag on the other, the Bloggie Touch fits in the smallest pocket of my cargo shorts and basically does everything that both of these devices do.  Ah, but if I ever find myself taking pictures in low light, forget it.

The streamlined features and simple to use settings found on the LCD panel were appealing concepts to me as well -- initially.For still pictures, I experienced the following problems.  The shutter (somewhat hard to find unless you are looking at the camera instead of at the subject of your picture) needs to be depressed halfway and slowly for the autofocus to work properly.  It is a fixed lens so my expectations were not high to begin with.  While this shutter is a common feature, on the Bloggie it takes practice.  It remains a very slow shutter process and it compromises the ultimate image.  The Bloggie does not perform in bright daylight -- the pictures have too much contrast and they are never sharp -- even at 12 megapixels.  In lower light, the colors quickly shift and the autofocus suffers even more.  A Bloggie's output appears to never be in focus --  even in regular interior commercial lighting.The videos are slightly better than the still pictures but they still fall short of any HD video camera of any size that I have seen.  The Bloggie is also able to take still pictures while it is filming a video.  The pictures are not worse than if they would have been taken on their own and the same is true of the video. This might be the only positive comments that I can make about the Bloggie's video and picture output.  The inferior pictures and videos are no more inferior when the Bloggie records them both simultaneously.The Sony software for the Bloggie (MAC version) that I installed and used is acceptable.  However, because the Bloggie will work with iPhoto, I gave up on the Bloggie software after 2-3 days.  The Sony software only has a fraction of the features that iPhoto has.I have always owned Sony products from many different categories.  I have had more Sony digital cameras and camcorders than I have any other Sony device.  If anything, I had hoped that my favorable bias would overcome my disappointment with Bloggie but it did not.  The Bloggie's output was inferior and always unusable.  I am sorry that i bought it.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "A value choice, but recognize the limitations", "Author": "Gaz Rendar", "ReviewID": "R31T87ZG911OU4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony Bloggie Touch has some neat features at a good price that makes it an interesting choice when compared to it's obvious competitors.I'll start by saying the packaging of the Bloggie is pretty cool.  It comes in a nice, compact box that you'll want to keep for long term storage of the device.  The Bloggie itself is also very svelte, small, and stylish.  It's smaller than most smartphones, but has a very usable 3\" touch screen on the back.  There is a faux wood pattern that adorns the front of the device, a record button on the back, and a power and camera button on the right side.  There is an HDMI port with a cover on the left side, and a flip out USB stick on the bottom.  Simple layout for simple, intuitive use.Touching on the screen brings up the 4 different menu options, which are rather limited.  The first menu lets you pick image sizes.  You can choose 720p 30frames per second, 720p 60fps, or 1080p 30fps.  The camera setting lets you choose 2, 8, or 12 megapixels.  Note that the 12MP images are 4:3 ratio.  There is a menu that provides a 2 or 10 second timer. The general setting menu allows you to set the date, HDMI settings, format the device, set language, and turn off the beeps.  The last menu is a PLAY button that showcases all of your media.  There is also a Wide - Tight digital zoom slider that's always present on-screen.  The screen itself does an admirable job of displaying your pictures and movies.  The screen isn't super responsive like say, an iPhone, but with the simple menu options it's never a hindrance.The software comes pre-loaded on the Bloggie device.  Turn the Bloggie on and plug it into your computer's USB port and you're ready to install.  The software is barebones simple.  You can view the media on your Bloggie and choose to import it to your computer, or you can automatically upload it to your YouTube and social media websites.  There's not much else going on here.  But there is one problem.  The software loads a Bloggie Watcher utility into your taskbar that boots when windows starts up.  There is an option to not have the Watcher Utility load when windows starts, but on 2 different Vista machines selecting this option had no effect.  The Watcher still loads when I start windows.  I had to goto my msconfig file to block it.  Don't know if this is specific to Vista, but it is annoying.  I shouldn't have to have even more mini-software programs bog down my start up time. Vista is bad enough as it is.As for the movie making?  Well, it's average.  The Bloggie has an autofocusing mechanism that can't be adjusted.  Here's where the video settings come into play.  The Bloggie Touch can take 1080p video at 30fps, which is better than the usual 720p that most competitor cameras max out at.  Unfortunately, you have to temper your excitement over the 1080p.  At 1080p, in medium to ideal lighting, from 4-8 feet away, the Bloggie performs well.  It can autofocus quick enough as long as you hold the camera steady.  If you're trying to focus back and forth between things 6 - 25 feet away, the Bloggie will struggle a bit.  Same if you're in less than medium lighting conditions.  I did find that the Bloggie performs noticeably better when it's at 720p / 60fps.  The video on this setting is clear and buttery smooth even if you're panning your shot at a normal speed.  It does a better job autofocusing at 720p 60fps as well.  Not awesome, but better. When you're in close-to-ideal lighting conditions, you can take some pretty good video under this setting.  Of course, this somewhat negates the distinguishing 1080p feature that separates this device from the others out there.What's it all mean for you?  Well, if you want a device that can take competitive 720p video with a smooth 60fps rate and you occasionally want to take 1080p video with a very steady hand, or tripod, in ideal lighting conditions, in an area where you don't changes in depth of field focus (phew...), then the Bloggie will work well for you.  Otherwise you may want to go with a competitor device that has better image stabilization.  And if you want to be able to take versatile videos in a variety of settings, then the Bloggie Touch and Flips of the world are not going to work for you; you'll need to pony up an extra $100-300 to get a decent camcorder with optical zoom and stabilizers.  But if you're looking for a good value choice, and recognize the video limitations, the Bloggie can work for you.

It's fairly simple to go through your videos, play them back, and set videos to auto-upload to sites like YouTube and Facebook when they're dumped to your computer.Taking video is a cinch. Press the red button. Boom, now you're filming. The Bloggie will automatically switch between landscape and vertical depending on how you're holding the device. This isn't ideal, as ergonomically it's easiest to hold the Bloggie upright -- which is also how you hold it for vertically aligned videos when most people will want landscape. But that's a minor gripe. By and large, it's painfully easy to shoot video. Even grandma can do it.Video quality is surprisingly good. Very sharp, even when played back on my plasma. The autofocus isn't always perfect, so keep your eyes peeled for that, but the issue didn't come up frequently. Video quality is a big step up from digital cameras that also do video or your typical iPhone/Blackberry.Dumping the stuff to your PC is a breeze. A USP connection swings out, you plug it in (with cord adapter), and you're dropping videos in no time.The Bloggie is small, thinner than an iPhone, narrower, but a bit longer.

Let's face it there's not a whole lot of choices for this kind of video camera out there , there's about 3 or 4 others and every single one of them has something that will make you cringe... Sony Bloggie doesn't support memory card which means once the internal memory is full you have to erase some to shoot some more and the battery doesn't come off as well so make sure to charge it before use... When I used my bloggie on my vacation trip I had to bring my laptop with me so at the end of every day I would upload all the videos to my laptop then erase it on my bloggie for the next day and the battery usually will last you all day even after shooting for 4 hours worth of 1080P ...I never had a day where we completely used up 4 hours worth in a day so memory and battery wasn't much of an issue for me as long as I can empty the internal memory on a regular basis... The HD Video looks sharp and the stabilizer works well, the only problem with this camera is that when you start shooting vertically you cannot turn it to the side (wide angle shot) without stopping it first or else when you upload your video it will be tilted since it doesn't automatically rotate the video if you shoot it in one continous motion (same with the iphones)... and just like most other pocket vid cams this one doesn't shoot well in the dark as well... My suggestion to everyone before buying a pocket vid cam, instead of looking for the perfect cam, try to find the most that will fit your need because there is not a perfect pocket vid cam out there yet.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "Dawniel", "ReviewID": "R53WF2OIJG0IP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente quede complacido con el producto, proximamente espero poder seguir realizando compras de este estilo, gracias por todo, Feliz A\u00f1o", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Trillmilk.", "ReviewID": "R2VWS3US2WN01B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pretty cool camera, I lost it.

This camera is perfect for the average day blogger hence the name Bloggie. It shoots videos in stunning 1080p and shoots still photos at 12MP.  The design of the Bloggie is absolutely beautiful! It looks like you are carrying an expensive piece of kit. I have the black color model shown above and it is like a brushed metal on the front with chrome around the lens. The camera has a 3 inch captive touch screen and only the recording button on the other side. The lens is a Sony Lens no Carl Zeiss or anything. Surprisingly though this camera takes pretty good photos and videos. The camera has a mini HDMI port on it so you can watch your videos and photos on the big screen. The camera has no physical zoom just digital but thats what you would expect from a camera this small. The image stabilization in this camera is amazing! I tried to take a blurry photo but it would not let me! My only real problem with this camera is how long it takes to auto focus while recording and the bad quality it has in low lighting. The only thing that was missing from this camera would be an led flash that would have been much better in dark situations (New Bloggie Cameras have this.).

The only things to keep in mind is, first: that the quality in low lighting is obviously not so great. Second, like many other reviews say, the auto focus is a bit laggy. I use the camera for filming underwater with a waterproof case and mostly for filming longboarding and skating sessions. The quality is amazing when the camera is well focused, if you are recording a quick motion like skating in my case, you need to give it some time to focus before you actually start recording or else the video will be somewhat blurry and you won't be able to tell when you watch it on the cam because the small screen always looks HD regardless.It can record amazing quality at 1080/30 FPS or at 720/30 FPS as well as 720/30FPS, great for slow mo editing.This camera is a great buy for the price and for its quality, it has yet to let me down and can compare to many professional cameras out

The sony bloggie does just that, this video camera shoots in great HD and is durable. I am a sports lover and wanted a camera that would be good for shooting sports. In the camera market, some cameras are better for sports than others, for example if a camera blurs with side to side motion it is not a good option for someone who will be filming on the sideline trying to get all the action from side to side. The Camera is great once it is in focus, sometimes it takes a second to auto focus but it has never been a big deal for me. The touch interface is user-friendly and easy to work with. The 720-60fps is a good feature for good quality slow motion play-back. I love this camera because it is durable and can handle quick movement and shoots good quality video. If there is loud sound it doesn't sound very good on this camera but for a sports lover like me I hardly ever use the original sound anyways, I got the case and a screen protector for it as well, i have dropped the camera a few times because I was running with it jumping off things ext. but this thing didn't even get a scratch.

As such I felt I was quite ready to purchase this item and already understood exactly what I was purchasing. When the product arrived, I tested it out and found that I was not surprised in the least by its performance. It was exactly what I was expecting.The camera takes excellent quality shots, and very nice videos (note: at 720 x 60 video quality). The sound quality that it records with was actually better than I had expected, I have no complaints about that.One noticeable problem that I was already aware of, is to try to be as still as possible taking the shots or they blur very easily - both pictures and video. It doesn't take much movement to ruin a picture, and videos do have to continuously \"refocus\" when moved (this is less noticeable at 720 x 60, more frames/faster refocus). The camera has a 1080p video feature, but I would not suggest using it - as I had already been warned to. The 1080 is at 30 frames, unless the camera is sitting on a tripod it'll be constantly refocusing when moved. Oh and; don't even think about taking pictures/video with this camera held vertically...it screws them up. Keep it horizontal.Overall it's perfect for what it does. I'm not an expert photographer/etc, I just wanted a simple, reliable product that was easy and fast to use and supplied me with both photos and videos that were both of good quality. This does just that.

Turn on the power: press the movie switch. Take your video. Hit the play button on the touchscreen to play it back. You can take stills while taking the video. The view screen is a very generous and bright 3 inches.All settings are made from the touchscreen, which is fairly responsive. The settings icons are big enough for a fumble fingers (like I occasionally am) to use.There are three photo size settings: 2 MB and 8MB for 16:9 ratio photos and a 12 MB 4:3 setting. No flash, so there is a lot of noise in the images once you leave bright daylight.There are also thee settings for video 720 and 1080 at 30p and 720 at 60p. Video quality is pretty good. It doesn't match higher end camcorders, but footage from brightly lit scenes is quite good. The lower the light level, the more noise you'll have. I tried some poorly lit indoor footage and despite the golf-ball sized noise, it was viewable.Focus is on the slow side. There is a 4X digital zoom which doesn't degrade the image too much.The USB connector pops out the end of the camera and Sony is kind enough to provide a short USB extension. There is a full size HDMI port, though you need to provide your own cable. I didn't try outputting to HDMI. Since the software provided with this kind of camera is, at best, mediocre, I didn't even try it. The file format is MP4 and opens nicely in just about contemporary video editing program.The camera is very compact, about 2 x 4 inches. The surfaces are all very slick which makes it difficult to hold. You will definitely want to use the included wrist strap. There are a couple of drawbacks, which I consider to be major, but not showstoppers. First, the camera must be used in the landscape or horizontal position. I'd rather have the option of a smaller image in the viewfinder, so I could hold the camera in a vertical position. Us it in the vertical position and the video is actually truncated! The tripod socket is on the bottom of the unit when viewed vertically. This means you must have a pan head capable of rotating 45 degrees. This simply adds to the problem of keeping your perspective correct.Overall, as such vidcams go, this one is very nice. Simple to use. Huge viewfinder. Excellent image in bright lighting and more digital zoom than others. Sound is passable. And output is industry standard MP4.

The other disappointing issue is the featured Bloggie Software, meant to be totally user-friendly to share pictures but, at least in my case, the software has never been able to create any preview or sample of my pictures, bcoming totally useless. My only choice has been to transfer my pictures using Windows Explorer. A real shame.

After I got it home I mounted it on my radio controlled airplane for some airborne video. I watched the video on the Bloggie and was quite impressed by the video quality. I took it home and hooked it up to my ROKU box to watch the video on my tv. I was shocked and really disappointed by what I saw.While the video quality was excellent, my excitement was quickly removed when I saw that the video picture was only several inches wide. It did not fill the screen as I had hoped and assumed it would. I bought an HDMI cable for it in hopes that might help. No luck.I posted it on Youtube for those that want to see what I'm talking about. The link is, I guess they block links.

I went to the web and quickly found that this is a common complaint with this camera.I then emailed Sony support asking if this was a flaw and perhaps I was overlooking something. Here is their response,Thank you for contacting Sony Support.I'm sorry to inform you that the image cannot be recorded in landscape mode while the Bloggie Camera is held in vertical orientation. However, please transfer the images to Computer and use any third party Software to change the images from portrait mode to landscape mode.Thank you for your time.The Sony Email Response TeamC2X7AnaNeedless to say I'm not happy about the product. How hard would it be to rewrite the code to allow a selection of portrait or landscape modes?Everything else on it works well.

Overall I'm very happy we decided on the Bloggie.My favorite qualities of the Bloggie are:- very easy to use and set up- simple touch screen, never even read through a manual before use- extremely compact and can come anywhere in my purse, a huge change from the video cameras from my youth!- easily hooks up to my TV so I can instantly share videos with my family or watch them immediately myself- all you ever need to do to charge or load videos onto the computer is pop out the USB plugWhat I wish they would improve upon is the auto-focusing feature does not always work well or is often delayed. This happens sometimes even in well lit rooms (like the very brightly lit room during my c-section!) I also wish they had positioned the microphone differently, as the way I catch myself holding the camera sometimes my finger positions over the mic and the sound is then muffled.

It comes in a good quality felt lined box and looks better than the usual vacuum packed item.I have not yet been able to truly evaluate the picture quality of this device although from what testing I have done it looks very adequate for the price.I am rushing to do this review because I want to alert anyone considering the purchase of this camcorder to the fact that when you are out shooting beautiful things, you will be able to see the video you have captured, but you will not be able to hear the audio that you hope you have captured.  Even with the playback volume turned all the way up, the sound playback is just slightly audible if you really strain to hear it.  I contacted Sony and was told to transfer my video to my computer and then play it back.  The sound should be normal.Unfortunately I cannot do this because right now I am having computer problems and my computer sound is completely dead.  I have ordered a mini HDMI  adapter so that I may play my video through my HDTV.  However, I will not receive that until next week sometime.But, why do they have sound circuits and a volume control in the Bloggie if they will not function normally on play back?  I sent Sony another email and this is part of what they said: \"Please note that, the Camcorder records the sound at a standard level for consumer models, ensuring linearity. Therefore, the recorded sound is lower than non-consumer devices. As the noise level is also lower, there is no problem with signal-to-noise ratio of the sound. Please turn up the volume of both the Camcorder and the other device, to increase the sound during movie play back.\"Gooble-dee-gook.  A fancy way of saying, \"So you won't know if your sound is any good until you GET HOME from your once-in-a-lifetime outing. Life is tough all over fella!\"  Had they said that it would have been better than not saying anything until after you buy the product.The camcorder has quality and is certainly worth the price.  Too bad Sony had to skimp on design.  They could have at least included a headphone output which would have improved the audio tremendously. But lying by ommission, puts a very bad taste in the mouth of anyone who appreciates knowing all the facts BEFORE they buy a product.This is a revision of my above review.When played back through another device the sound is adequate except video and audio can play back all chopped up.  However, if you play that video again it can show normally.  The bottom line seems to be that you have play around with it to get good results.  You will learn by doing.  The complaints some reviewers had about this product were based on ignorance and lack of common sense plus the inability to have a little patience while learning to use it.My contribution to ignorance was that I was completely unaware that I could not expect to play back sound in the field and felt that it might be a defect in the unit.  But Sony should have seen to it that their advertising removed the chance of someone having that ignorance.All in all, you could not get a better mini camcorder for the price.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good enough for $159", "Author": "Luis Garcia", "ReviewID": "R3QIO1VI0X2547", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Awsome video quality, fits in my back pocket, beautiful design, bargain priced, and its a SONY!Cons: Touchscreen should be a tad bit more responsive, no flash when taking pictures in low light ambient, very grainy photo quality at night, only 30 min recording at a time, no 1080p @ 60fps setting (only 30fps).Overall I am satisfied enough, yes I do recommend it as an ultra portable and inexpensive gift! :)", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good Hardware, don't both with the software", "Author": "Jason Goldberg \"Retailgeek\"", "ReviewID": "R3JSYG1YK5GRG7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just picked up a MHS-TS20 to replace a first generation Flip Mino HD.  In general I'm satisfied with the purchase.Pros:Great formfactor/sizeBuild Quality - it does feels like a sturdy well-made metal product (vs. the flimsy plastic of my old Flip)Speed - it starts up quickly and can have me recording in about 3 seconds.  The menus are reasonably responsive.Video Quality - 1080p looks pretty darn good, the tiny lens and sensor aren't great in low light, but nothing in this category is.Image Stabilization - while not as good as a real camcorder, it's a big improvement over no image stabilizations.Stills - the stills are decent and it can even capture stills while recording video.Cons:Audio - no provision for external mic, and the internal mic has tons of handling and wind noise.  I didn't expect decent audio out of this device, and pretty much got what I expected.Focus - I was satisfied with the fixed focus on my old Flip.  The Sony has auto-focus which is an improvement in some cases, but can also be a negative when the camera starts hunting for focus and gives you no control.  Being able to use the touchscreen to define what to focus on, or being able to lock the focus on infinity would be a big improvement.Software - Don't plan on using it.  You can't specify where on your PC it stores your video/still files.  You can't add new sharing services (SmugMug, Vimeo, etc...).  It has no editing beyond basic trimming.  It doesn't let you manage what stays on/comes off the camera, etc...  You'll be happier if you just assume it doesn't come with any software.Misc - It has some silly misses, such as no way to tell what firmware version you are using, how long a video clip is, etc...Orientation - I wish the sensor/lens could rotate 90 degrees.  If you want normal landscape format video, you must hold the camera in landscape which is slightly less ergonomic than holding it in portrait.  With the Flip, you can shoot landscape video while holding the device in portrait, which is better for one handed operation.Bottom Line:  If you need a small/simple device to capture pretty high quality ad-hoc video clips, this will do a good job. If you're expecting a full-featured video camera replacement you'll probably be disappointed.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than you might think", "Author": "M.

We wanted a camera that we could use to film parkour, free running, and skateboarding with so portability was key.  What we ended up with was a camera that not only performed for those purposes more than adequately but was found to be a great camera all around.Pros:The camera is very light yet felt very solid. The 12.8MP still image sensor performs very well and even catches slight movement VERY clear.  The video recordings are taken in mp4 (ipod) format which all of my video editing software accepts fine.  We needed to update Windows Movie Maker to get it to work with that though. Once set up, you can mark pictures and videos to be uploaded and/or emailed, then when you plug the camera in to your computer it does it for you.  The USB is attached to the camera itself so there is nothing extra to carry.  If you need a quick charge, borrow a USB port from a comp and get charging.  The camera also comes with a USB dongle for those ports that are not in the most convenient spots.  The screen on this looks fantastic.  8GBs of storage is plenty for me.  If I have 4 hours of video on it and have not uploaded then I am doing something wrong.  The power up time is minimal.  I havent timed it but I would say its about 2 seconds from power button push to ready to shoot.Cons:The touch screen is really sensitive.  Now it is not so sensitive that it causes a great amount of frustration, but in my opinion it is a little too sensitive.  An option would be appreciated in which the screen sensitivity could be adjusted.  That might be asking a lot, I dont know but it is just how I feel.  The same could be said about the accelerometer (the thing that makes the screen adjust when you turn the camera).  Sometimes I feel like I barely tilted the camera and the screen will adjust on me.  Now, its not a big deal because it easily comes back.  They may have made it like this to be responsive while shooting.  The manner in which I take pictures and video, that amount of sensitivity is not necessary.  The USB dongle that comes with the Bloggie is a little short.  I am not sure if it will actually make anything better if plugged in to a front USB port on a full size tower PC. Unfortunately in retail, its not the thought that counts.Summary:If portability is the name of the game then this camera provides a lot of options at a decent price.  Of course there are better cameras on the market that will do one thing much better than this camera but the Bloggie does all sorts of things really well.

I think the main reason would be something like an overseas adventure where you don't plan on bringing a laptop and already have your iPhone stuffed to the gills. In either case you will get `good' video at a great $ value. If you don't have an iPhone this is a worthy contender.If you want `great' video quality you need to move away from small sensor devices into pro-consumer grade digital camera and micro four third systems. If there is one key point to convey; the video resolution only matters so much... with complex scenes the bitrate of the stored video will matter more and a 1280 x 720 video with a compressed 30 Mbps output will outshine a low bitrate 1080i.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bloggie a little touchy", "Author": "staccato", "ReviewID": "R28SGSPH1LEOT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been getting used to my Bloggie and just when I think I've got it down I have go back and review procedures.

They tend to be overpriced and force you to purchase their proprietary accessories. My opinion has changed after using the Bloggie.  When I got this camera the first thing I asked myself was, \"Is this a camera, or video camera?\"  I have still cameras that take video and video cameras that allow you to take still pictures; I wanted to know which category this fits into.  After using the Bloggie  I would put it in the category of a video camera that can take pictures.The first thing you notice about the Bloggie is it's slim and sleek profile.  Sony opted for a smartphone appearance rather than the often cluttered multi-button interface of most cameras. There are only three buttons on the camera (power, video on/off, and shutter click).  Most of the controls are handled by the touch screen.  The touch screen menu system is clean and easy to access.  I have large fingers and did not have any trouble making choices on the screen.  The only issue is that I had to train myself to slide the zooming control smoother, otherwise the autofocus would not be able to keep up with the zooming.  But this is an issue you encounter with every video camera.The quality of the HD videos is great if you have plenty of light.  As the light decreases the autofocus often has trouble locating the proper target.  Although after testing the camera a couple of times in a darkened hallway I was able to understand how the Bloggie chooses targets and now the focusing is better.Sound quality is very nice.  I did not experience any clicking noises like some of the other reviewers mentioned.  I even did video playback on the camera and on my PC (haven't tried the HDMI connection to my TV yet).The picture clarity of the still images is okay at best.  A good prosumer digital camera will outshine the Bloggie all the time.  The issues the Bloggie has is that the lense is too slow (afftecting the exposure) and there is no external flash.  You would not make a living as a photo journalist with this camera.  In well lit situations (especially outdoors) the still images are very good.The software included in the camera is great.  Just plug the camera into a USB port and it installs the needed software.  This is convenient because now I can upload pictures from any PC.  Sony makes it a breeze to upload videos and photos to your favorite online social networks.  I uploaded both photos and videos to Facebook with no problem.  This is by far the best proprietary software I have used with a video camera.  Granted I still prefer Adobe Bridge, but this is simple and quick.That said, the Bloggie is not perfect.  There were a couple of issues (mostly minor) that kept this camera from being a 5 star winner.  First the placement of the microphone on the left side of the camera (when held in a horizontal position).  I am left handed and I noticed on a couple of videos either my hand or fingers must have been covering the mic.  I can hear something brushing against the mic. Along the same lines, in one video my little finger on my left hand can be seen as I start the video.  Both of these issues can be prevented by training yourself how to hold the camera.The camera could really use a flash for the still pictures.  I understand that most video cameras do not have a flash, but since the Bloggie is trying to blur the line between video and still cameras, that would be a nice addition.This is a great little camera for the person who finds themselves taking a lot of video and would like to take the occasional picture too.  Its slimline profile makes it great for vacations and on-the-go impromptu occasions.

The camera uses the MP4 format which allows you to upload the video or photos to sites such as Facebook, YouTube, and Flickr. It features a 3.0\" LCD touch screen so you can easily search for your photos and videos. It has a built-in USB arm so you can connect the Bloggie directly to your computer to upload videos and photos. The Bloggie records up to four hours of HD video and has 8 GB of internal memory.What I like about the Bloggie Touch Camera:The Bloggie Touch Camera is very easy to use. I have the Flip Video Camera and the Bloggie Touch Camera is much easier to use, especially the record button. I love the fact that you can use it as both a video and still camera - it is much easier to carry around just one camera. The pictures and videos come out nicely and quite clear.  Both the video record button and still camera button are easy to use. It is easy to choose which video to upload and where you want to upload it. It is also easy to upload the videos to places like FaceBook and it takes very little time. The touch screen technology is a lot of fun. Having the USB arm attached to the camera is another plus as it is one less thing to carry around. The Bloggie Touch Camera is slim and fits easily into a pocketbook or even a pants pocket.What I don't like about the Bloggie Touch Camera:While it is nice having a built-in USB arm, the connection is very flimsy. So flimsy that I never could connect it to my computer without the camera falling off - I use the camera with my laptop. The button for recording is right above the USB arm and I accidentally hit it more than once and started recording while trying to connect the Bloggie to my lap top. There are a lot of icons on the Bloggie screen that can be a bit confusing. There is no flash option so unless you have the proper light the picture/videos can be dark.Bottom-line:The USB arm issues aside, the Bloggie Touch Camera is a nice video/still picture camera that is easy to use.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Handy Videos but not a Camera Replacement", "Author": "Tanya McHenry", "ReviewID": "R1QLT4515O3TGO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "What can I say about the Sony Bloggie Touch? Well one the highlights is the device is very easy to use.  I mean you have a lot of camera's out there claiming ease, and then I get calls late in the evening from my relatives who are trying to figure out how to use them. I think the videos look very good too, I mean this little device is a great HD camera for novice purposes and easy to use so why only 3 stars? Well I will be happy to tell you. First, the Bloggie arrived on my doorsteps virtually unusable. I cannot tell you how excited I was to rip open the box, see one of the most delightful little black boxes I've seen come with a device in, well ever, and then turn on my Bloggie. It pretty much went downhill from there. The touch screen was unresponsive, clunky and so poorly implemented that I wound up reading Kanji after my first few attempts. My Japanese is pretty poor but not non-existent so I wound up, after several awkward attempts of getting the device to reset to default settings. Kudos to Sony for providing a way to get back to default, but shame on them for shipping a device that was unusable out of the box. I understand that firmware updates are a standard, but you would think you could at least use the camera before having to hook it up to a PC right away. You can't in this case; the touch screen software was that bad out of the box.  The other problem is that the camera still shots, pictures, have this terrible orange tint to it in low light. Now I know what you are going to say, what you are thinking. This camera doesn't have a flash. I realize this, I really do but the thing is, if you take video in the same light, the camera doesn't have this problem. It is so bad that I cannot use this camera in my house at night under artificial light.In summary, this is a really fun device for videos AFTER you update it, but barely even mediocre for pictures.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "This camera is perfect.", "Author": "Kip Sanford", "ReviewID": "R36GSHW2AEKC2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The bloggie touch camera is perfect for outdoor videos.

Right out of the box, I loved the look and feel of the Bloggie Touch. The brushed metal and chrome in a small form factor felt substantial and expensive. The capacitative touch screen was responsive and the camera turned on and was shooting within 1.5 seconds. Although the Bloggie Touch only has a mono-microphone, the sound quality was surprisingly good. Voices were natural and, even when shooting in windy conditions, I didn't really have a problem with the audio tracks. The camera is simple to use.  Other than setting the video and photo qualities (720p at 30fps, 720p at 60fps and 1080p at 30fps), there were no other settings to play with.  Sony was definitely trying to steal a page from Flip when they designed the Bloggie Touch.Unfortunately, the Bloggie's actual video quality is poor, regardless of which setting you use. Most of the video footage I took in outdoor conditions was overexposed and most of the indoor video was had an unacceptable abundance of pixilation, compression artifacts and evidence of over-aggressive post-processing by the Bionz sensor.  The colors were also blown out.  To get an HD look, the camera seems to compensate for the small lens by artificially pumping up the color (making them excessively vibrant), increasing the contrast and using heavy-handed digital edge enhancement, which gives images an artificial look and feel (lots of jaggies and very dirty looking). The images also lacked detail--except when the camera was in macro mode (it did pretty well up close). While these issues create a less than satisfying image when the camera is in focus, the true downfall of this camera is its horrible (truly abysmal) autofocus mechanism.  In more than two hours of test footage that I shot in indoor, outdoor, bright and dim environments, the camera was out of focus 60-70% of the time.  When the camera is in focus, the image quality is acceptable for a low cost pocket camera, but it takes almost two or three seconds for the camera to lock into focus.  This doesn't sound like much, but if you're following a subject and moving the camera (even with a gentle, slow pan), the camera is constantly adjusting the focus and never achieves a lock.  The result is blurred images--that look good for a second and then slips back out of focus.  Lowlight conditions (which, for this camera, is basically anything indoors) wreck havoc on the autofocus causing images to blur to the point of being unwatchable. The camera also has a tiny lens and a huge sensor, so all of the images look noisy and pixilated--even under the best shooting conditions using a tripod.  Sony was going for specs to make this camera look good on a spec sheet and didn't worry about the quality of the video output.  Sony should have pairs this lense with and 8 mega-pixel sensor instead.  The only good shots I was able to achieve where using a tripod, outdoors, shooting slow moving/fixed objects with the sun to my back.  Given that this is a camera that's meant to fit in your pocket and is meant to be used on the go, that really makes this camera unuseable.I had the bloggie for two weeks, but ultimately had to return it.  This camera doesn't hold a candle to an iPhone 4.  There are many better choices for similar money--including a few real 2010 model year HD camcorders that are now being cleared out and even Sony's own Cyber-Shot DSC-WX9 (which only costs $20 more) is superior in every respect.  I replaced the Bloggie Touch with a JVC Everio GZ-HM300, which is available for $195.00 on Amazon (and can be found for less online). If you must have a true pocket camera, I would strongly suggest getting Kodak Zi8 or Kodak Playsport Zx3 (both are much cheaper and provide significantly better image quality).", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this Camera", "Author": "FredR", "ReviewID": "RZEGE44ZLC5IK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Simply google: bloggie clicking and you will see instantly why.

My camera seems to have that clicking noise too and produces a clicking in the background on the movies. I find this unacceptable for a video camera to impart noise into a film.

First, the video feature on my still camera is terrible, so I had to get a dedicated camcorder. This performs way better than my cell phone or still camera, and it's small enough to fit in my pocket. As is typical of a Sony product, the build quality is very good. The body is made of plastic but it feels solid.The 1080 feature was the major reason I chose this model, but the performance was underwhelming. The image would smear and blur when you panned the camera slowly, and the digital zoom turns the image into a blocky mess.Fortunately this has a 720p at 60 fps setting. This setting looks really great. When panning, the video is sharp, and clear.  The digital zoom is much better at this resolution, with some blockiness at the max zoom (4x). At half zoom, the image still looks good. You can zoom while recording, something my cell phone can't do.With a name like Bloggie, I wasn't expecting much in terms of image quality, but I was pleasantly surprised. The image is bright and colorful. The CMOS tends to give everything a slightly yellow tinge compared to my Fujifilm CCD camera. The exposure seems to be a bit over exposed. Some details tend to get blown out. For example the flower petals lack details from overexposure while the darker leaves look OK. This is really a minor issue and is not a deal breaker. The still images and videos are not overly compressed, so artifacts are not a problem.As others have stated, the auto focus is really slow, so I was expecting this problem. It's not that big a deal unless your focal point is constantly changing. It's  really slow when the scene is dark. It took almost 10 seconds in a dimly lit room. I think most of the processor power is devoted to face recognition, because it's quick to find faces.This is not a high quality consumer camcorder, so it's not appropriate for a graduation ceremony or a wedding. This was intended for casual videography, and it's perfect for those youtube moments.I can say that this is the easiest and most convenint camera to use. Press one button to turn it on, and press another to take still images or record a video (two separate buttons for still, and video record). It's small and thin enough to fit in your pocket. The still images are good, and the 720 video is very good.

If you like waiting 10 to 15 seconds for your camcorder to focus, then this one's for you. Sometimes it would focus 6-7 times in a 2 minute period. Also shoots horrible in low lighting, very grainy and dark. Speaker is on the top where your finger goes, so if you're not careful you could cover it and have muffled sound on your videos. If you are buying this to take it on a vaction or to film outdoor events, such as sports, this is not for you. I also bought 3 mini HDMI cables until I found one that was compatible. (Not all mini HDMI cables work with this.)It's a shame, I really wanted to like this camera but sadly I really disliked it. Spend more money and get a real camcorder like the Sony HDR-CX150.

Howes", "ReviewID": "RDFNO9R22NDED", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I want to like this device, and in many ways I do like it. It's light and convenient, and when moderately well lit creates lovely crisp high definition video, and erratically nice stills. If I didn't have experience with other devices, I might even love this device. But I have experience with other devices.I carry an iPhone 4, and I can say without reservation that iPhone 4 users will have no use for this camera. While the Bloggie can generate 1080p/30 video, therein ends any advantages it might have against my phone. The phone can take HDR stills, has a more responsive screen, allows network uploads of video and stills, allows for in device editing, is easier to use, has GPS tagging of content, an LED flash, has touch to focus, has better white balance, has a more robust viewing environment including pinch to zoom and doesn't have an intermittent odd clicking sound over some video (the auto focus motor?). I'm sure many high end Android and Windows Phone 7 users will find the same lack of value.Having said that, this camera is markedly better than the piece of junk in my wife's iPhone 3G S, and is superior to the cameras in the current generation iPod Touch, so conceivably, users of those devices could find this camera useful in a supplementary role.As an iPad user, I was disappointed that I cannot directly import media from the Bloggie onto my iPad via the Camera connection kit. The iPad complains that the Bloggie wants too much power.Other problems include: It's too easy to cover the lens with your finger; a ridge around the lens would have fixed this. The shutter button is flush with the case and generally hard to use by touch alone. Similarly, easy to cover the microphone accidentally. Low light images and video have absolutely horrible white balance. Digital zoom is too prominent and easy to accidentally activate; you rarely want to use digital zoom if you are going to edit the video anyway. Mac users will often get a bad eject warning after removing the device as there is a useless software distribution partition which will have to be ejected separately from the media partition. And it's useless for Mac users as its only use is to launch a website with a promise of future Mac support. And the volumes are formatted as FAT32, which while an understandable choice for maximum compatibility does limit video capture to 2GB per video, which is not long at 1080p.Also, this camera shoots 12 megapixel stills. I know this is an industry wide problem, but who thinks it is a good idea to have such a large number of pixels married with such a small lens, short focal length, and correspondingly small sensor area? Don't people realize that using a 5 megapixel sensor with its correspondingly large sensor elements would result in less noisy images and better low light performance. I implore camera manufacturers to not put anything more than 5 megapixel sensors into any camera smaller than a micro four thirds format. As it is, I have this thing set at generating unnecessarily noisy 2 megapixel images; I'm not going to be printing movie posters from these images, please try marketing to the educated consumer.The good features include. Really nice image stabilization. Will charge in an iPhone/iPod wall charger. Amazingly accurate realtime face recognition. Decent compression at 100 MB per minute of 1080p. Works well with iTunes. Decent battery life. Doesn't show motion as \"jellyvision\" artifacts like the Flip HD camera I sampled earlier in 2010. Has a tripod mount threading on the bottom.But, sadly, I cannot possibly recommend this camera. The bar is just too high.

Since I needed a better camera than what's on my cell phone and has a better battery, I need stills and video capability. I worked using the stills mode over the weekend and the shutter speed is awful. From the time I push the button there is 2 seconds delay before the picture is actually snapped. There's no way to capture people without them looking elsewhere by that time or getting decent candids. Out of about 20 photos, 3 were too blurry to even post.There was also almost no instructions whatsoever. I plugged the device into my pc hoping a digital set of instructions would come up but instead I got to an app for SONY that wants my credit card information for billing me for some account I don't want. The information makes it sound like it's so easy to share images and files but it isn't at all. I didn't want to give my credit card information even for a certain amount of \"free\" storage so I didn't get to test the uploading out. Just trying to make an album was awkward in that software and then changing a name on one of the built in contact lists didn't let me go much further; I changed the name of \"My Best Friend\" distribution list, then what? There was nothing to enter their email address, cell phone number for texting an image, nothing. It's a clumsy tool.I also couldn't find any way to make the camera front-facing which would be especially useful for people looking to essentially have a better version of what cell phones offer these days.I had bigger expectations for this overall.

This camera is small, lightweight, and easy to use, but has a few major issues that made me regret the purchase.First and foremost, this camera has a really difficult time auto-focusing. I was filming some kids who were moving around a bit and almost ALL the footage is out of focus. It sometimes takes a full 4-5 seconds to focus, and by that time my subjects are out of frame doing something else. Also, as some other reviewers have mentioned, the microphone is placed incredibly inconveniently so it is often covered by fingers when holding the camera in a natural position.

I've had no problems at all with it.  Its HDMI out works very nicely too, so that you can just plug it into the TV and watch.  The camera does have a few downsides: (1) poor low-light performance.  There is a ton of image noise in low light and it looks like you're shooting on a 1st gen cell phone camera.  (2) poor stills.  Not too important, as that's not really its job, but important in that this can't really be your \"all-in-one\" type device.  If you're, say, on vacation and want great pics and video, you're better off taking the DSLR and shooting your video with that.I think this camera's real value is for those of us with babies who often are looking to grab a camera quick because baby is doing something cute.

The Bloggie Software is a bit bland but it allows you to view your videos and photos as well as share them with your social media and family/friends so it is good.

It would also be great to be able to do some minor editing and sharing right from the Bloggie.It is a great size, fits in my pocket or purse and it very easy to hold. I LOVE the touch screen. The features are easy to use. The Bloggie auto flips from horizontal to vertical when you change orientation. However, in vertical mode, there are black sidebars which are a bit annoying. It would be nice if it had an auto adjust to make it fit the screen in vertical mode.One other feature I wish it had was a dual camera (like on the iPad 2/iPod Touch 4, etc.) but that isn't a con, just a wishlist.Overall, is a very nice video camera and will be perfect for our trip!", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Nifty Little Pocket Camcorder", "Author": "Hope", "ReviewID": "RSYR05T5Q5MU2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This nifty little pocket camcorder is just what I expected at this price point.

The software is also very basic, I found it to be somwewhat slow to act when prompted. Easier file naming for later retrieval to other programs would be a nice upgrade as well. The software also has a tendency to crash a bit, thus forcing the user to close the program, and restart it.Aside from the software glitches, however, the picture is in beautiful HD, and has a brilliant picture quality, especially in a well lit or outdoor setting. Low light situations, however, don't look very good and are somewhat grainy. I like the size of the unit, and the slickness in the design. IT's a classy little unit.

I was super excited at first as we have a 1-year old and i wanted to record every moment. Sadly, the camcorder takes about 8-10 second to focus, so those first seconds are always blurry. Second, the zoom in option is toach-screen (you have to move your finger up a bar) which sounds fancy, but it's the worse. Every time i want to zome, I have to stop focusing on the object to find the bar and then my finger either moves it too close or too far and because i'm putting more focus on the zoom bar than the object, the entire image is distorted - as a consequence, I don't use the zoom anymore. Third, when you download the videos (let's say you've done a months worth of videos and you might have downloaded some to share on FB but not all), when you go down to download to store (in my case in order of date because I'm a bit type A), it doesn't tell you when they were taken.

I've never gotten it to work on three different computers and Sony's customer service comes close to being the worst I've ever had the deep displeasure of interacting with. The online CS chat must be manned by chimpanzees.Every time I execute it on any of the computers I tested, it errored out instantly. The CS chat told me initially that this was because Sony does not support it on 64-bit OS, such as the Windows 7 laptop I was using. I thought this very fishy so I tried it with a 32-bit Windows XP and Windows 7, both of which errored out as well. I've given up on using it.Now the camera: It's a nice camera with a clarity problem taking video in anything but clear sunshine. How bad? Well, it's not terrible, but it shares this dastardly characteristic with some other cameras I've tried. This isn't saying much as Sony has a pretty good reputation with graphics and video and one would expect they would do better than be content to be counted as best amongst the worst.Working the camera also presented a problem: I found I almost always had a finger cover part of the lens in landscape mode. Then again, I could just have fat fingers, but the placement of the lens was such that if you naturally holding it, the risk of covering the lens was high. This wasn't a problem in portrait mode, which the camera switches between quite easily.In good lighting, I really liked the quality of video and the relatively large viewing space. I found I never use the digital zoom on the touch-screen because it results in low-quality video (yeah, don't use digital zoom, ever. Walk closer) and I also really liked the ability to take still shots during video recording although for some reason--perhaps outlined in the manual?--the stills were bad to terrible quality.The lens gathers and keeps dust and I had to spend quite a bit making sure it was clear. This wasn't a problem I'd had with some of the other cameras (such as the Kodak Zi8).

My friend videotaped a few short 5 minute segments and then proceeded to download them to his PC using Sony's software.  It convolutes the location and uses bizarre filenaming conventions to store the files on your PC, rendering it extremely difficult to find and identify the video files with any other program (using filenames like \"import26349983627561\"  WTF?).Anyway, we get the videos on the computer and try to upload them to a YouTube account, follow all the instructions and Sony's bloggie software responds with \"File too big\" - that's it.  FU.  Your shiny new camera can't be used with YouTube.  Buh-Bye.YouTube's file upload limits at the time of this writing are maximum 15 minutes and up to 2GB file size.  Is a 4 minute video shot on the Bloggie more than 2GB in size??  After some exploration on the PC, I finally find the video files (again which are named with bizarre filenames that have no relation to what the video contains) and the size?  184MB.  So why can't it be uploaded to YouTube?  Clearly, Sony's bloggie software is lying to us about the limitations on uploading this video to YouTube.We managed a work-around by manually uploading the files to YouTube outside of Sony's software, but this creates a significant problem because after awhile, all the video files are obscurely named and virtually impossible to identify on disk, and nowhere in the Sony software does it give you the filename.  Sony also uses the same filenames but with different directories further compounding the ability to organize the videos in some meaningful way outside of its very limited software.This unit is unfriendly and very limited in its functionality.

Instead use the auto focus to your advantage and know that it'd focus MUCH FASTER if the whatever you wanna focus on dominates the screen (daylight makes focusing even easier).2. Bloggie produces the best still images in the pocket camcorder class BY FAR. It's 13 megapixels for gods sake. It's well in the digicam category. There are lots of camcorders out there that doesn't even let you capture a still image let alone in 13MP resolution.. Like *cough* flip *cough*.. And people still want a full xenon flash in this thing? Next thing is the battery getting drained due to the flash and more people whining about low battery life.3. This is another funny thing. I mean seriously. This thing has among the best low light performances in the segment. Way better than flip. Keep in mind this is a 150$ pocket camcorder. DON'T COMPARE it to something 5 times its size and cost.4. Most moving lens system would make some amount of noise while it moves. This is true for all pocket camcorders with a movable lens system. STOP placing your finger over the mic and amplifying the internal lens noise and you'd be fine. NO clicking noise no nothing.5. There are tripods that actually swivel 90 degrees. The bloggie would only work on that.6. This is up to you guys. Personally I love not wanting to carry those little cards around. And I find 8GB more than enough for me. Another thing is that the built flash memory is fast enough for 1080p vid recording you don't have to worry about buying cheapo cards thats not fast enough.If you still need a 50$ camcorder with Xenon flash, 15MP stills, 1080p video, 100 hour battery life, 30x optical zoom and want it in a size smaller than a cell phone. Just wait 6-8 years and let the technology catch up to your idiotic dreams.This is what I think :Among the best in class quality video in daylight.Best in class low light performance. (NOWHERE NEAR DEDICATED CAMCORDERS but can give some cheap digi cams a run for its money)13 MP stills... mhmmm do I really need my digi cam?Full 1080p recordingAuto macro for that close up shots and videos.Still image capture while recording.

Still, with a bunch of young kids, I'm often taking movies of the young'uns, so I was excited to have this.  This is maybe my fifth or sixth digital camera and fourth digital camcorder.  This is the first of my digital camcorders to have a touch screen--a feature I absolutely love.  Of course, the problem with a touch screen is smudges--but it's something I'm willing to deal with for the touch screen ability.This little camcorder is amazingly stylish.  If looks are a big thing, then you'll love it.  Resolution is great.  Storage is great.  Software seems fine to me as well.  Easy to use--designed to let you post to YouTube or Facebook in a flash.  The lack of flash hasn't impacted me yet--although I'm sure it will.  Not sure how I'll overcome that.NOTE: The only way to charge your Bloggie (at least that comes with it) is via a USB cable. I find that very annoying. Couldn't they at least include a regular wall plug? I can see myself out travelling, and having to hook up my netbook just to charge this camera.  What a pain!  You can buy a USB Charging Adaptor from Sony for $24.99.  They'll give you 15% off if you register your Bloggie, but still that's a steep amount for a plug.I received the 2010 December Consumer Reports today and they recommend two earlier models on Sony (ranked #2 and #4 of the pocket camcorders).  The Bloggie MHS-CM5 is #2 and earns a 53, just behind the Kodak PlaySport Zx3.  The Bloggie MHS-PM5 is #4, and earns a 52.  Although this Bloggie was out before the issue went to press, it was not included.  Still ,the fact the both Bloggies were recommended gives me confidence in this model. The one thing that the previous models had that this one does not is a little screen/lens head that you could flip out.  I think that would have been a great feature to keep.  One feature that this does much better than my Kodak is take good stills.  With my Kodak, I felt like I always had to have either my separate digital camera or my phone ready.So for me, the Bloggie is an improvement over my last digital camcorder in terms of resolution, for that I'm happy.  Still, in a few years when my kids are older, I doubt I'll use anything other than my phone to take 99% of all videos and pictures.  I'll give Kodak credit for including a wall plug though. Heck, even iPods come with one.  Is Sony so cheap? The flash issue is also a big oversight. I haven't experienced the clicking in the audio, though.*What to do with old cameras?*If you're like me, and you have quite a collection, you might wonder what to do with your outdated ones.  Besides giving them to friends/relatives/kids, I highly recommend looking into nonprofits that use them.  RAWA is an organization in Afghanistan that helps women fight domestic abuse--and wants digital cameras and camcorders.  Ask at your local school/YMCA/boys/girls club. They may want them either for a digital photography class or for teachers to use.  Ask at Domestic Abuse shelters, etc.  eBay has a page called the Rethink Initiative (just Google it) which can help. Try and find a good home, and if you can't, check with the manufacturer about recycling opportunities.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Focus .... please focus  Very Disappointed", "Author": "unbiased reviewer \"horriblemongo\"", "ReviewID": "RKDNHYKZAVSGH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was really excited to buy this and I choose it over the Flip because it offers 1080 quality.

If the quality of video/stills is not critical, you could definitely do worse.However, if you're a stickler for image quality, then I'd strongly urge you to consider the Canon Powershot S95 - which is the best combination of still and video that I've encountered.

(I understand that is coming soon). I was hoping for a phone sized camera that I could tuck in my bag for the kids to use at the skate park or to use myself at concerts or outdoor events. (We all take video/photos frequently) I was not intending to have this replace my camera, just to be something small and useful for impulse use. Unfortunately, nine out of ten things taken with the Bloggie were useless. When the conditions and lighting are perfect, the camera takes a lovely image - unfortunately my life rarely lends itself to perfect conditions. The bowling alley didn't have enough lighting for the camera to work properly for still or video. Shots taken outdoors were much better, but the focus lag still left several of them very blurry. I found the touch screen less responsive and accurate than on my other devices. This is a great idea, but it's just not well executed.Edited to add - Updating this 3/2012.

It was intended as a gift for my daughter.  She's just in middle school and isn't a super \"technical\" type so a clean, not overly complex user interface was/is a motivating factor.  This piece is a very pretty package, too.  But that's about all the praise I can give.Once I turned it on, I noticed that the capacitive touch screen isn't as responsive as what most of us have grown accustomed to.  I had to tap on the various options usually more than once.  I got a little better at this with some practice, but the fact that I had to practice my \"touch technique\" at all is a fail in my opinion.  The next thing I noticed though was the real deal breaker.  It's very awkward to hold in operation.  It feels more natural and comfortable to hold it in a vertical orientation.  And just like the specs say, it will rotate the screen to keep everything right-side-up.  But that looks very strange in playback because it's creates huge black side bars, similar to watching a 4:3 image on a 2.35 screen except much worse.  So you ideally need to hold it horizontally, in which it's hard to find a comfortable grip.  For me at least, the grips that did work felt somewhat insecure, too.....instantly conjuring images of it getting dropped by my daughter.The actual video quality I'm not qualified to judge as I haven't had a camcorder since an old over the shoulder vhs, lol.

I contacted Amazon and they suggested a return, but then I contacted Sony and they said to send it in for repair under warranty and that's what I did.  They were very fast and it was out and back in just over a week.  They replaced the battery and initially it seemed to work.  However I only had maybe 15 minutes of recording time with it when the battery went down again.  I hooked it up to charge but once again the camera wouldn't take a charge.

Its easy to accidently reset the device to defaults.  I was a little disappoint by the cable that came with the device.  It would be sufficient to connect it to your laptop, however, the device literally has to hang off my desktop from the usb port.The camera portion of the device is very poor.  First off, the default setting for the camera is low res.  2nd off, once you set the camera to take pictures at full resolution, the focus if very slow, and it it does not handle low light very well at all.

More proof that Sony does NOT wish to admit to this issue. I finally received an e-mail which somewhat acknowledges the clicking problem. I am currently waiting for the Sony rep to get back to me because I have demanded a NEW Bloggie. If I am not satisfied, I will be spreading that e-mail acknowledging the clicking issue far and wide, including every one of their CEO's and Board members, of which I have found a detailed listing of contact information(which wasn't easy, mind you!).DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!SONY WILL NOT STAND BEHIND IT!!!!!!!Update: Sony is shipping us a new Bloggie--different model, 22L?

No flash on a camera in 2011?! Indoor pictures, even when flooded with window and overhead light, turn out dark. Disappointing.Second, unless pictures are taken with a tripod, they often turn out blurry and slightly out of focus. Also, no modes for \"landscape\" \"portrait\" etc. exist.Third, the software is a mess. All photos land in an \"Everything\" folder in thumbnail form, making a large portion of pictures very difficult to sort through. After installing an update, many pictures went completely black, and after a call to a Sony technician, they just told me to re-install the software (which made no difference). Grrr.I waited past the 90 days to return this to the manufacturer where it was purchased. After calling Sony with all these complaints, they said they were unable to do anything for me either.
