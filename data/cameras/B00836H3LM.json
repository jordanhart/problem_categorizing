{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This camera is a very nice upgrade of the already very good SLT-a55", "Author": "N Doxey", "ReviewID": "R14IQFOHNKXMRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used a Sony SLT-a55 for the past year and a half and purchased a number of the Sony and Zeiss professional lens.  This combination has produced very good output.  Some of the finest pictures I have ever taken were with the a55.  However I was annoyed that the camera was not as responsive as my a700 and the overheating problem during video recording.  So I preordered the SLT-a57 March 18th and it arrived yesterday.  I have only had the camera one day and I am very impressed and think the upgrade from the a55 is very good.  I think the Sony SLT cameras offer an excellent feature set.  I am a fan of the EVF technology.  Much of my photography is done shooting stage events where the lights vary greatly across the stage.  I love being able to see the adjustments of the camera setting in the EVF and shoot without needing to refer to the output on the LCD screen.  What you see is what you get. I can concentrate on the subjects and wait for just the right moment in the action. I prefer to compose the scene through a VF anyway. I no longer take an OVF camera to stage events.  Getting the right exposure is so easy with an SLT camera.  The exposure on stage can easily vary from 1/30 to 1/640 sec at F4 depending upon the subject position relative to the lighting, especially spotlights.  I no longer do any exposure bracketing.  I also enjoyed the continuous focus during video recording (DLSR AF during zooming while video recording is poor), and in camera HDR feature that works very well.  I do prefer an OVF camera for studio work with strobes.  I have been very impressed with two other features of the SLT-a57 already.  The first one is focus peaking during manually focusing.  I have poor eyesight and could no longer manually focus a scene.  But with the focus peaking feature my manual focusing that been restored.  It is like a part of my vision has been restored.  I now would buy a Sony SLT or NEX camera just for this feature alone.  The other feature that appears very impressive is the clear zoom feature where the picture quality is processed and improved over what one usually gets from a digital zoom which degrades the IQ. You can zoom up to 2.8x on any lens attached to the camera.  I have uploaded two pictures for you to see the magnification of my CZ 16-80 zoom lens at 80mm while lighting the subject with bounce flash (These are jpg pictures right out of the camera. Notice the knots on the beaded jug as a reference).  I now will have a very nice combination with my a77 for event photography with some SSM lens.  I want to thank the engineers at Sony for this feature set.  In the past I felt that Sony offered some excellent lens but that each of their camera models was lacking an important feature.  Now I feel that Sony has produced two excellent cameras in the SLT a77 (I bought it for its AF system (which is great) and the ability to micro adjust lens focus) and the SLT-57 model.  They are very fun to use with a super feature set.  They are fast, feel good in the the hand and produce very nice pictures indeed.I tested the clear zoom feature further tonight and I think that it works as advertised which is amazing.  You can digitally magnify the image up to 2.8x more while still retaining very good image quality through Sony's image enhancement feature.  I included some pictures taken with my telephoto lens on the Sony a57 product page here on Amazon shot at an 8 Mp resolution.  Look for yourself.  I made my 200mm telephoto lens a 400mm with the push a button.  There is a picture taken with my 400mm lens for comparison.  It doesn't look like a gimmick to me.  4-29-12 I uploaded more pictures to the Sony SLT-a57 product page after a trip out \"birding\" with an 400mm lens.  I think people interested in photographing wildlife should consider this camera.Update: 5-23-12. Recently, I shot 3 stage events and I am satisfied that this camera's clear zoom feature works just as well indoors as outdoors. I was very impressed with the reach of this camera and the IQ of the images using it with a Tamron 70-200mm f 2.8 lens. I did not need to go above 1600 iso to get the shutter speeds I needed even with dancers and felt no need to do any noise removal in post proceeding. The feature set of this camera gives one so many options. Using the focus peaking feature with manual focusing more and more.Another problem that is resolved when using the SLT-a57 when shooting stage events (formal concerts like choir or orchestra) or weddings is how quiet the shutter is.  It is almost silent.  In the past using a OVF camera with a moving mirror I could not get the shots I wanted for fear of causing shutter noise at a time when everyone in the audience should be quiet like when a soft song was being played or sung or when the couple is exchanging vows during the wedding.  I would have to wait until a rise in volume occurred so the shutter noise would not be noticed.  Often during concerts I shoot video and take still pictures (with two different cameras) at the same time. Then when I played the video back I could hear every shutter click when using the OVF camera like my a700 or a580.  What a pain.  Now I record video and shoot with the SLT-a57 at the same time and I do not hear the shutter in the video at all. Now I shoot whenever I want during the event.  I love the freedom a quiet shutter mechanism gives me. The a77 also has a very quiet shutter as well.  I am very happy with this purchase.Update 10/27/12.  I have shot with this camera for another 6 months and my satisfaction has only grown.  I love the focus peaking feature for manual focusing.  It is the best focus assist system for manual focusing in the world.  I have shifted over to become a full manual mode shooter.  I now have raised my photography to another level.  Another feature have works excellent as well is sweep panorama.  My sunset pictures are even better.  I do agree with other people that Sony needs to improve the jpg engine of all their cameras especially with shooting in the shade.  Anyway this is a class leading camera.  An excellent choice for someone starting photography.Update 11/30/13.  I wanted to add a short update.  I am still shooting with this camera.  I cycle and hike a lot and even though I also own an RX100 I take the a57 with me most of the time. It is my outdoor activity camera and I have use the in camera HDR and panorama feature all the time with the focus peaking.  That allows me to put the focus right where I want it in the scene.  My preferred lens with this camera is the Sony 16-50mm f2.8 SSM.  It takes sharp landscape pictures.  I am also fond of a light weight and \"poor man's\" telephoto lens.  The Tamron 200-400m f5.6. My copy is sharp at 400mm.  The a57 camera and those two lenses stay in a backpack where I can just grab them and go. Sometimes I will include the Sigma 70mm macro for closeups.  Also I have really enjoyed using the a57 with the Sony 15-50mmf2.8 SSM for video. This setup is silent and the camera does a very good job metering the stage productions I video.  I can keep the exposure compensation and the clear zoom adjustments on the live view LCD and make silent and easy adjustments to the image. I just shot a high school play for the drama department and was very happy with the results.  The AF with phase detection was very accurate and quick.  I was very pleased that the camera never hunted once as it reestablished focus as I changed scenes.  Canon is trying to make a big deal about their AF with video with the 70D.  Now not is news of a new feature to me I have already been using AF during video for a year and a half.  I think the negative press that the Sony SLT cameras have received are such non issues (like the 1/2 stop loose of light from the fixed mirror). Now this camera is an old model and can be bought at very good prices.  I just have enjoyed this camera so much.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great step up from the A100", "Author": "Derrick", "ReviewID": "R18QHJ99FQ2FS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this from another retailer before it was available from Amazon. I needed it in a hurry because my A100 failed. The a57 is a very good camera but it took some getting used to.This is my first SLT so I found the LCD viewfinder to be a bit strange at first when using a DSLR. It is very bright, and has a bit too much contrast when shooting in very bright sunlight. The LCD multiple angle live/playback/menu screen is great. Easy to see even in bright daylight. Being an SLT (single lens translucent mirror) camera, the a57 is extremely quiet when taking pictures. I use the Intelligent auto mode or the P mode most of the time as opposed to the Superior mode. I don't want the flash to pop up on its own when shooting in low light, which it does very well. All my older Minolta AF A mount lenses work well with the camera, including my Sigma 28 f2.8 macro lens. My older HVLF36am flash is completely compatible with the a57 as well.The camera body is the same size as the a100 although a bit lighter in weight. It has a comfortable grip with room for all my fingers (no pinky hanging off like with earlier Sony DSLR models). The controls are layed out logically. There is one minor problem...it is possible to hit the movie button by accident. I would prefer a slide switch to start a movie as opposed to a button. You can eat up your memory card without even knowing what happened if not careful.I am still a guy who misses film (I had my own color darkroom) I shot mostly 200 ASA negative film and 400 ASA in very low light conditions. So at 16 MP I feel that the A57 takes very sharp pictures in all conditions. I took a look at the a65 with its 24 MP and its brighter OLED View Finder but really did not see enough advantage to the camera to spend an extra 200 bucks. I think Sony had that in mind when they replaced the a55 with the a57. If you really want the extra MPs then 200 bucks is not bad, but you don't sacrifice much if you go with the a57. As a matter of fact you get a couple of new features with the a57 not available with the a65. One is Auto Portrait Framing. When taking a picture that captures a face, you can center and snap and the camera will automatically save a second image, re-frame the shot using the rule of thirds. Pretty cool I think. Also, if you are willing to shoot at a smaller picture size, the a57 will fire at 12 frames per second. At the largest pic size it will shoot at 10fps.  Not bad for action shots. Last the a57 will shoot at 16000 ISO which for all of us old film buffs translates to a lot of pushing in the darkroom.Not having used an SLT with electronic viewfinder before, I found out that there are things I like... such as the level indicator, and things I don't like..like too much info cluttering up the viewing area. Fortunately info displayed is optional and you can change how much you want to see.The a57 uses the larger M size battery, the same newer battery for the a100. The a55 which the a57 is replacing uses a smaller battery, which doesn't last as long and tends to get hot as well.The Pros of this camera are many....sharp pictures even in low light. Records movies easily (also a con)Terrific number of auto shoot modes for all kinds of conditions including portrait re-framing and auto HDR along with multi frame exposure for low light conditions.Uses the large M batteries.Bright LCD multi angle live/review/menu screen.Cons (keeping the camera from getting a full five stars)View Finder screen has too much contrast when shooting in bright daylight, .Easy to hit the movie button by accident...with a finger or against your chest.The camera has some fun things I have not used yet..such as the panorama sweep mode, both 2d and 3d. Not having a 3d television I doubt that feature will get used much.All told I look forward to using this camera for a long time to come. I will say this...I still like looking through an optical VF so my a100 is going in for repair. Using the a57 and the a100 together should allow me to do just about anything including shooting HD movies.I am updating my review, now that I have learned a bit more about the camera and giving it five stars.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast, Quiet, Beautiful", "Author": "Beka", "ReviewID": "R2LMHB0AKVLV7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony a57 is a really fantastic camera.Handling of the camera is excellent and the way better than any competitor.Its design and built quality are simply perfect, it fits in hand ideally. Not only that it's easy shooting with various settings with a57 but it's also very pleasing.The shutter is really quiet and smooth. The electronic first curtain shutter significantly decreases sound and vibration caused by shutter mechanism.Articulating screen is very useful and once you get used to it's a very comfortable and necessary feature to have.Viewfinder is more than good enough, although it's not as good as OLED EVFs we have seen in high-end SLTs but it's much better than competitor's small OVFs. Most important thing is that with EVF \"what you see is what you get\" unlike OVFs where you have no clue what your final image is gonna be like.One more thing, manual focusing with traditional DSLRs is a really headache, it's almost impossible to get accurate shot since the OVFs of entry-level DSLRs are ridiculously small, but with EVF you can use MF magnification or Peaking feature and never bother again how accurate focus will be.Autofocus is really fast, unlike nikon competitors you have built-in AF motor that you can use with old excellent minolta lenses. Face detection, object tracking and AF area features are on board, so you have great ability to customize Af behavior. The shooting speed is excellent, at least twice as fast as rivals and a57 has a HUGE BUFFER SIZE (21 raw+jpeg) that takes fast shooting experience to a higher level. Video quality is outstanding, full HD 60fps is really enough for even advanced video shooters and customization of video is much better than firs generation SLTs. One downside is that if you shoot with AF you can't go wider than f3.5 and it's a shame but with excellent peaking feature you can shoot with manual focusing without any trouble.There is not reason to talk much about image quality. It's excellent and it's not big news that 16mp sony sensor is really great. I think everyone is aware of that, since D5100 D7000 A580 A55 A35 nex-5n etc. have the same sensor. Some people claim that a57 sensor is improved over a55 but it's not true. Raw image quality is exactly the same. The one thing sony is still behind from canikon is it's jpeg engine. While White Balance colors and contrast are very good, sony a57 still fails to get as clean and detailed jpegs as the sensor allows. At low iso images are fine but at high iso NR shows its ugly head (I always keep it at Low setting).I won't talk much about features. Clear image zoom is really gimmick and does nothing useful and auto portrait framing is only for kids under 10, it uses RULE OF THIRDS composition and crops picture, if you can't do it yourself and if you don't enjoy framing during taking pictures then why you should buy 700$ camera? So those are features that I turned off the second I got the camera and never turning them on again. Peaking, HDR, panorama and painting effect HDR are really useful features.Before the listing of cons I want to say why this camera is better than Cnikon rivals.WHY YOU SHOULD CHOOSE A57 OVER NIKON COMPETITORS: A57 has much better handling experience, is much much faster, has Larger buffer size and much more features. A57 has Built-in focus motor and Built in image stabilization so you get IS and AF with every lens you attach and with nikon you get neither of these with old lenses. People say that nikon has the same sensors and recieves extra half stop light but come on, while nikon gathers 1.5x more light sony has steadyshot and can shoot at least 3-4 times longer with any lens, so you can get at least 2 times more light, so in most cases(except you're using stabilized lens on nikon) you get at least one stop ISO advantage with sony. OVF technology is really old and uncomfortable and it's obvious that with SLT you have much more chance to get right shot than with SLR. OLD minolta lenses are soo cheap and so good, you can get under 100$ some excellent lenses and have full functionality. much better video with full-time PD autofocus.WHY YOU SHOULD CHOOSE A57 OVER CANON COMPETITORS: canon has fallen behind in sensor technology. Image quality of Sony sensor's are much superior to canon's. even with extra half stop light canon iso performance is no better than sony in terms of Dynamic range and color depth sony really puts a shame even canon's pro sensors. much better video with full-time PD autofocus. much better build quality, much faster, and 5 times larger raw buffer kicks canon out of game.Cons of A57:can't choose ISO other than power of two (x 100).Not-so-good Jpeg engine without opportunity turning of NR.No auto ISO in manual mode.No hope that sony will ever do firmware upgrade.EVF refresh rate still has to be improved.EVF dynamic range isn't match of sensor's DR.Aperture limitation on Video (when using AF).Bracketing has only two options 0.3 and 0.7 EV.Most of features doesn't work when you shoot RAW+jpeg (it's soo distracting).ISO buttons location is far from perfect.Why the \"?\" button isn't customizable and who needs the button that doesn't do anything but showing guide?To sum up a57 is a great tool for photographer and it not only does many things but does everything well. This is a camera you'll fall in love with and this is camera that shouldn't be pared with crappy 18-55 kit lens. I highly recommend to everyone buying this camera.

Period.", "Author": "Christian Ellsworth Capo \"blues squier\"", "ReviewID": "R1YQHY8IBPX20U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a photographer with more than 20 years of experience, and I was looking for a near-professional camera and great walk-around lens. i evaluated the Canon T3i/T4i, and Nikon 5100... all of those are good cameras, but the price/features is biased by the \"pedigree\" of the brand.The Sony A57 is a great camera, feature rich, the body looks great, it takes great pictures, and the battery last over 500 pictures.Why Sony?Pros:- LCD viewfinder, finally on the viewfinder all the relevant info is available, this camera is not a DSLR, but a \"translucent mirror\", which removes part of the vibration of physically rising the viewfinder mirror on each picture. on this the Sony is way more stable and less prone to vibration when taking pictures, the only \"moving parts\" are the sensor stabilization, and the sensor curtain.- High ISO sensor, and multishot Noise reduction (takes several pictures and combine them to remove image noise of high ISO settings)- 12FPS at 8MP o 8fps at 16MP. no other \"pedigree\" brand beats that.- Great Lens. the 18-135 F3.5-5.6 is a great walk-around lens.- Great on body features, like HDR, Panoramas, 3D panoramas, fullHD 1080P videos in 24fps, 30fps and 60fps.- On body image stabilization: this means that you can use any old Minolta AF lens and get the benefits of the image stabilization found on the Alpha Body. On Canon or Nikon, if you need image stabilization, you need to buy expensive new lenses.- Cheap and available Minolta AF (Maxxum and Dynax) lenses, flashs and accessories. I bought out from ebay 6 near mint different lenses for less than 300$, and 2 Minolta Flashes for less than 100$- On body motor for lens AF. (Sorry Nikon I still have a grudge on you for the motorless bodies, many of my old Nikon AF lenses are now manual focus, and on Ebay to buy additional Minolta/Sony lenses).- The body embedded flash, is good for 25-30ft pictures, good for indoor pictures.- The camera has all the wireless flash features on the body to fully take advantage of any Minolta wireless AF D flash or new Sony flash.Cons?- No grip (official or 3rd party) available for the camera yet- APS-C sensor crop hits you on the fish-eye/wide angle lenses, killing a 1/3 of the view angle. this is a common problem for all cameras not full frame.Side comments: if you buy a DSLR/SLT camera (any brand) make sure that you buy a cleaning/dust removal kit (sensor, mirror and lenses). my pick?:Giotto's Rocket-Air Blower Professional AA1903 Large (Red) + Lenspen Lens Pen Cleaning System + Lenspen Digi-Klear LCD Monitor Pen Digital Display Cleaning System + Accessory Kit for Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax and Sony Digital SLR Cameras this worked wonders cleaning some dandruff off the mirror (windy day lens change)UPDATE after 3 months of usage:The camera performs great, after learning more of the options, the camera keeps impressing me. With a Minolta 50mm 1.7 lens, at night, with the light of only a single birthday cake candle i shot a great sequence of a friend blowing his birthday cake candle, amazing stuff, no flash, 12fps, and lights where solid and warm. camera is great. buy it now that the price dropped a few hundred dollars.UPDATE after 8 months of usage:This camera still amazes me, solid performance... I had the opportunity to play with 3 wireless flashes (2 Minolta HS5600D and one Sony 5600)... amazing results and the camera has the wireless built in... Chalk that one up for the A57 against \"entry\" same price range on Canon or Nikon.I also added a few \"expensive\" lenses to my bag: a Sigma 170-500 F5.6 Super Tele-zoom. great for long range outdoors. the A57 performs awesome, the built in motor on the camera allows to use those oldie but goldie glasses.Latest Firmware also adds on camera corrections for additional new wide angle lenses, to correct chromatic aberrations and distortions.Don't buy the new A58 as a replacement of the A57, since is a more of a mix between the A37 + A57, not an upgrade... if you are looking for a upgrade, check the upcoming A7x when available, or wait for the A77 to lower the price.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very impressive camera, and well worth the (not so high) price!", "Author": "Chiradeep Chhaya \"Genetically Alien\"", "ReviewID": "R13E5TG2M5R15V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Please see updates below------------------------A couple of caveats before I get into the review:1. I am not a professional photographer by any means, and2. I've only had this camera for a few days and haven't shot across the range of featuresThat said, I believe this is a wonderful camera for those that - like me - aren't in the top 20-25% as far as skills or demand levels go. And I say this more as a compliment - there's no reason why the remaining 80% of us will find this camera any bit unsatisfying.I owned an alpha 230 so naturally the video shooting features are a big plus. However, I still believe that video shooting should be left to specialized devices - this one does well but Sony itself warns that prolonged usage can heat the unit up. For short clips, like I need of my newborn cooing or flailing his arms or squirming around in his crib, the continuous autofocus is wonderful.The camera comes with a number of useful modes, such as the various options under SCN or the Inteligent Auto and Superior Auto. However, my absolute favorite is the Intelligent mode with flash off. Shooting portraits indoors benefits greatly when you can quickly dial into this mode. Of course, you can use a mounted flash to bounce light off or use a diffuser - I doubt that my newborn's going to hold his smile while papa behaves like a pro.Another favorite is the level guide on screen. Helps greatly as a first step to good composition - getting the image leveled!Speaking of composition, the Auto Portrait feature takes getting some used to and may not always produce the exact composition you were looking for. However, it's still a useful feature in that it helps the 80% population correct some composition mistakes.The sweep panorama mode is a welcome addition too. Be aware, though, that there's a setting that controls how wide the panorama should be and setting this to \"wide\" instead of \"standard\" often requires you to swoop the camera over 180 degrees, increasing chances of shake and misalignment (the camera almost always complained that I needed to hold steady).Canon fans often like to point out low light performance as a big plus over other makes. While I won't dispute performance over 3200 ISO, I found that shooting the moon over Manhattan on a clear night at 1600 ISO didn't result in a whole lot of noise (unless you were thinking of printing out a poster and examining at a pixel level). Plus, it's hard to beat value at this price.There are other fun features, such as in-camera effects, that might be useful at times.All said, I am quite happy with the indoor performance of the camera so far. The alpha 230 was pretty decent outdoors and I don't see why this one wouldn't be an improvement.Finally, here're a few reasons to not opt for an alpha 77:1. I didn't know what I'd do with 24MP that I couldn't with 162. It's still Sony so any negatives as far as high ISO performance goes would be carried over3. I don't care about GPS4. I'd rather invest the remaining sum in a Tamron 70-200 f/2.8 or the SAL 16-105, both worthy utility lensesUPDATE 11/2/2012----------------I've had this camera for a while now and I continue to be mighty impressed with it.As I've explored further, I've realized that this camera - and other alphas and SLTs - include in-camera correction for distortion and CA. I think that's a huge plus to not have to rely on something like Lightroom, especially since LR doesn't have profiles for a majority of Sony lenses (a shortcoming that I think Sony should address).High ISO NR and Long Exposure NR have both come in handly a number of times. Although High ISO NR tends to compromise contrast slightly, I think it still keeps the images very neat and correctly exposed. Plus, there is no perfect contrast point so you can look at how much noise is acceptable and adjust contrast during post processing.As mentioned in my original review, video capture capabilities seemed good then and have seemed even better after some use. I had an addition to my family during the past few months and video has come in very, very handy.If there's one slight negative, it is that the use of flash is controlled by what mode you're currently shooting in. It takes getting some used to and I found myself going to the Fn button often. However, once you use the camera enough, you know what's your best mode for shooting in specific circumstances.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "A review for the non-professional", "Author": "E. Gollihar", "ReviewID": "R29AT5O1T27BJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, so this review isn't going to be anywhere near as technical as most I see posted. And it won't have a lot of direct comparisons of competitive cameras. What it WILL have is my opinion of this amazing camera after using it for a month, and how I wound up choosing it.To begin with, I used to do a fair amount of SLR photography back in the 80s and 90s. I was never all that serious about it, though, and switched to point and shoot digital cameras in the late 90s. And until recently, we've been perfectly happy with the good quality digital cameras we've invested in. The one exception has been for taking pictures of my son's basketball and daughter's volleyball games. No matter what we did, we couldn't seem to avoid blurry pictures where you can barely make out faces.After some research, we decided that going back to SLR was the way to go. But coming back to a big camera isn't enough in itself. You really need to buy lenses with f-stop ratings at 2.8 or lower (2.2, 2.0, 1.8, 1.4, etc). Some of this can get expensive quickly. But luckily, Sony has a couple of very nice lenses (the 50mm 1.8, the 85mm 2.8, and the 35mm 1.4) for not a lot of money. I skipped the kit lens.So how did I end up buying this camera? Kind of by accident. Starting out, I was convinced I was looking at one of the Canon Rebels. Then I read great things about the Nikons in their D-series (D3100, D3200, and D5000). So I was focused on picking one of those. Then I read an article saying that the new Sony cameras can use older Minolta autofocus lenses, which piqued my interested. I have some old Minolta AF lenses, and it would be nice to be able to use them again. But that alone wasn't enough.So the research began. At first, I was put off by how many people had really negative things to say about the Sony cameras. But eventually, it occurred to me that almost everyone who was slamming them DIDN'T ACTUALLY USE THEM. Most were people with long-stated preference for Canon or Nikon. Which is fine, but not really helpful. Once I focused on reviews from people who are actually using the Sony cameras, it became clear that people who own them love them. That, combined with the wealth of features (big, bright, pixel-dense display, easy to use auto and program modes, great video capabilities, ability to use Minolta lenses) left me favoring the Sony slightly before purchase.Now, after using the camera for a month, I can say without question that we made the right decision. We've already taken hundreds of photos in all kinds of situations, and without fail this camera delivers. Granted, it sometimes takes a little playing around with the settings to get what I'm looking for, but as I'm learning there's less and less of that. If you're new to digital SLR cameras, the Sony does a decent job explaining itself to you, and there are plenty of online resource (youtube videos and the like) to help you figure out the features and make the most of them.So my recommendation? Unless you just have a preference for Nikon or Canon, you will likely love this camera. It takes excellent photos, and that's what it's really all about.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony a57 is almost perfect", "Author": "Merto", "ReviewID": "R1TAL0QEQ012DL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So it goes, \"a picture's worth a thousand words.\" It looks like Sony remembered that video is the master of pictures in motion. That's my take on Sony's new mid-range A-mount camera in it's Alpha series. The Sony SLT A57 is a fast, quality camera with impressive video capturing capabilities.RECAP: A DSLR (digital single lens reflex) is the digital version of the same flipping mirror technology that has dominated serious photography of the past half-century. You look into a view finder and when you snap a picture, the mirror that you were actually looking at flips out of the way so a sensor can make a copy of what you saw.  Sony, with it's SLT line, fuses a forgotten technology with it's background in electronics to make a completely innovative camera that threatens the royal DSLR family of Canon and Nikon.Instead of a flipping mirror, the a57 uses a semi-transparent one that doesn't need to flip which enables this $700 camera to take rapid 8 (full control), 10 (aperture control), and all the way up to 12 (cropped resolution) frames per second. In this respect, the transparent mirror is allowing Sony's SLT cameras to compete with others 4x it's price. That stationary mirror is paired with an acclaimed 16.1 megapixel CMOS sensor that has a very fast phase detection auto focus.The A57 has all the other details a DSLR would afford you. The things that work especially well are its ISO performance, up to 16000 for quality in low light conditions. It has a host of fun borderline gimmicky options like auto-portrait framing where the Bionz processor takes a look at a photo and crops it using the rule of thirds. The in camera digital zoom works unexpectedly well allowing my kit lens to get some respectable macro shots. It houses a larger battery than it's predecessor, the well-received A55, allowing up to 550 shots on a fresh charge. Memory Pro Duo and SD cards (class 10 recommended for keeping up with a57`s decent buffer) are accepted in the larger rubberized grip.Sony's newest offering is larger than the model it replaces inspiring confidence that the company was listening to customer feedback. It turns out mid-range DSLR customers didn't want smaller and delicate in their models but something more substantial with plenty of grip options and spaced out controls for one-handed activation for most features. Sony's live view has been excellent since it entered the DSLR market after acquiring all things Minolta. It's fully articulated though it's majorly annoying that it's hinged on the bottom, which means even on a tripod it's difficult to do self capturing. The electronic view finder (since its not a true DSLR, no flipping mirror remember, everything's recreated digitally) is easy to use and greatly enhanced from the A55, though still no OLED inherited from the higher end A65 and A77.If you have a collection of Minolta Lenses or have one of the first few Sony Alphas that didn't record video, then the A57 represents digital SLR movie making in it's prime and now would make right for an upgrade. Video capture is where Sony's camera shines utilizng its in-body camera stabliziation (they call it Steady Shot) and its constant phase detection auto focus. Regardless of price, few DSLR's can compete with how fast and accurate the A57 is when recording in movie mode. There's no flipping mirror so auto focus is never turned off or in need of readjustment unless you want full shutter and aperture control. For indie film makers, probably the most important thing of note is that Sony's new SLTs record in full 1080p at 60 frames per second and now also 24 progressive frames a second. The A57 records video at a bitrate up to 28 mbps which is a bit less than a hacked Panasonic GH2 or Canon's T3i but neither do 60 at 1080p. Unless your going to do extensive and repeated digital manipulation to your videos, my opinion is 28 mbps is of very high quality.  In any case, shooting video with a DSLR and the many lenses that offer up a shallow depth of field can yield expensive looking results.There's a lot of fanboy-ism when affiliations are made to a camera manufacturer. Nikon and Canon make excellent products in the DSLR market, Panasonic does well with its micro four thirds system and Sony's stronghold as underdog may well change with it's SLT line of semi-transparent mirrors. With any of the above you get large image sensors and full manual control options over exposures which is why they yield better results than cheaper point and shoots or typical smart phone affairs. In my opinion, what it really boils down to are the lenses. Not the mirrors, definitely not the megapixels and not the brand's name. If you have a bunch of Canon or Nikon lenses then stick with Canon or Nikon. However, if you have old Minolta lenses (don't forget all Minolta Maxxum A-mounts work with all Sony A-mounts) or are starting from scratch then consider the A57. Like all Sony Alpha DSLR and SLTs, it has both in body stabilization (negating the need for the more expensive stabilized lenses) and a built-in auto-focus motor. The last two things simply mean that you could save money in the long run if you plan on buying a few more lenses.Did any of this make any Flipping sense?After a few months of use I am finding the lack of on board audio controls with no choice but the auto gain to be inconvinient now that I do more video work. Recording audio separately is usually best anyways and the onboard stereo mic work well for syncing but it would be nice to throw a rode video mic pro or sony's own ecmalst1 and not worry about picking up the camera's motor noise.

After taking on a full-time gig I was responsible for shooting stills too.  After much research I decided on a Sony A55, the company then gave me a bonus and I ended up with a Sony A57, man, I lucked out.I'm not going to give you all that kakamamie tech talk, it's just that this camera can take some exceptional shots whether you're a pro or a beginner.  You want a great Point 'n' Shoot or a camera you can experiment with and get some incredible artsy fartsy stuff?  Answer, Sony A57, A65, A77 or A99, more money, more camera.  This DSLR (A57) has a ton of features.  Believe me, after 6 months I'm still learning new stuff and I love it.Ok, the Nikons and Canons also get great results, but they usually don't have so many of these magic bells and whistles, like panorama, 3-D and some of the other effects too.  Plus most of those Nikons and Canons which closely resemble the A57 cost quite a bit more.  The one very important and cost saving difference is the ability to utilize the old Minolta Lenses.Minolta lenses have a reputation as being very well built glass which gives a unique natural color (Minolta Color).  Whether you're shooting video or stills if your glass is cheap your pictures will reflect that.  Now you have the opportunity to acquire really good glass at bargain basement prices.  Yeah, they'll be used, but out of the three Minolta Lenses I have already bought none have been bad, some were even NOS (New Old Stock).  I also highly recommend some third party lenses, like the Sigma Fisheye 10mm (purchased from Amazon), wow, that will certainly give you a new perspective, great for concerts and artsy fartsy stuff.The bottom-line, the Sony A57 cost less than any other camera with similar features, but if you want great glass it'll cost a ton unless you can get some good Minolta Lenses.  I have two friends, they're kind of pros and they use Canons and Nikons, then they played with my camera, asked what it cost and their mouth dropped, what!  One of them was so pissed cause they had just purchased another new Canon. Already a couple of my other friends have purchased an A57 after playing with mine.  Really it's no-brainer with the recent price drop, just start shopping for some good used Minolta lenses fast, do your research...KG", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Evolutionary Step from the a33/a55 Models", "Author": "Ray \"A Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R22J43N3DDJCVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a pretty long history with Sony cameras. In addition to the \"litter\" of point and shoot models I've purchased from Sony and used in both Europe and the US, I've also long experience with the venerable DSC-R1, the SLT-a33, and the F707/F717/F828 series (which may or may not be described as \"point and shoots,\" depending on your perspective). I would have to say that I very much enjoyed the a33, and under the right conditions, that camera (the a33) can knock out some truly terrific images. The a33/a55 had a few deficiencies, as all cameras do, but if you learned to work around them, it wasn't much of an issue.Now, if you are an owner of either an a33 or an a55, you are probably reading this review to help determine if the upgrade to the a57 is \"worth\" it. If you are new to the Sony line, you are probably comparing this model to some of the Nikons or Canons (I've some experience with these, as well, having owned the Nikon D7000 and the Nikon D5100). I can tell you that I would be able to recommend the Sony SLT-a57 for either category of users, and although what I write here has probably already been commented on by everyone else already, it still is helpful to hear another person's impressions of the camera.What is it that makes this SLT-a57 so nice? Here's some of my reasons:1. Highly responsive - nearly instantaneous autofocus, quick power on, and no delays in the menu system2. Lightweight - it's a tad heavier than the a33, but not much; this is still one of the lightest DSLR's you'll run across3. Gorgeous flippable screen - high resolution, and can rotate through two axes of motion4. Good image quality - it can hold its own against the other brands (there are some caveats, as always, and your lens model has a large impact on this)5. Very comfortable grip - improved from the a33/a55 (which is on the small size) in both shape and the tactile surface6. Loads of advanced features - multi-shot layering, HDR, special effects, and, of course, aperture mode, shutter mode, manual mode, etc., etc.7. Extremely reasonable price - even when not on sale, it's a great price, particularly when you pick it up with the highly reviewed 18-135 lens as part of the bundle8. Long battery life - the battery type, though still in the \"M\" series, has more charge capability than the older \"M\" batteries used in the a33/a559. Excellent video capability - can take video in high resolution in both \"i\" and \"p\" modes, as well as either AVCHD or MP4 formats10. Built-in help system if you are new to DSLRs, and want some advice for shooting with certain modes/conditions11. Generally good physical layout of buttons12. Super high burst rate of 12 frames per second (faster than most any camera in this class, and perhaps equalled only by some extremely expensive models13. Electronic \"spirit\" level can be displayed on screen to verify horizon (every DSLR should have this!)14. A number of Zeiss lenses are available for the alpha mount (including Sony SAL-85F14Z 85mm f1.4 Carl Zeiss Planar T Coated Telephoto Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera, Sony 24 -70mm f/2.8 Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Cameras, and Sony SAL-1680Z 16-80mm f/3.5-4.5 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T DT Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera)I have paired this camera with the very nice 16-80mm lens, but I have also been using the very inexpensive Sony 35mm F1.8 lens, and the images have been exceptionally good. Based on the reviews I've read, you should get very good results if you purchase this with the 18-135 lens, which is apparently made in Japan, and is being offered at a fantastic price when you purchase it with the a57. Overall image quality from the camera is therefore seen as very good (with the exception that the jpg rendering engine for the a57 is not as good as some other brands, sometimes resulting in minor image artifacts under some conditions), and images are generally sharp and contrasty (you'll need to post-process to maximize sharpness, but this is true of nearly every camera).The camera is exceptionally responsive. Due to the speed of the unit, you can focus on your photography, and not wait for the camera to catch up with you. If you prefer to use the viewfinder, the electronic viewfinder on this unit is improved from the a33/a55, and most people say that it is very adequate for a camera in this price range. I usually compose and shoot using the LCD display, and because there is no mirror to flip down and back, you get instantaneous focus and shooting. They say this is an entry-level DSLR, and I suppose it is, but that doesn't mean you can't take images like a pro with this camera. You just have to take time to learn how to use the various functions, and you can really knock off some terrific shots with this.Are there any shortcomings with the camera? Well, yes, but none of them seem to generally be deal breakers. Some of these might include:- Sony alpha lens lineup does not have the same range as, say, Nikon or Canon (however, there really are plenty of alpha lenses available from Sony, Sigma, and Tamron, and more to come from Sony in 2013, if the latest rumor is to believed)- Batteries are expensive (but they are for all cameras when you buy brand (which I recommend for this camera)- JPG rendering engine really could use some improvement (but if you are really concerned about this, you can shoot in RAW mode)- No \"flash off\" setting for P/A/S/M modes (flash will pop up, but if you push it down, it will stay down from this point...)- No custom leather case (yet) from Sony (but I suspect this may only be a matter of time)This really is a great deal all around, and as I write this in late 2012, there is a sale going on that has brought the price down quite substantially, making it even a better bargain. This is an easy five star recommendation, even when at retail price.Recommended Accessories:I very much like the Sony STP-GB1AM Genuine Leather Grip Belt -Black, and use it all the timeA fantastic filter is the Sony Alpha VF67CPAM Circular Polarizing Filter (Black), which is coated with the Zeiss T* coatingA second (and possibly third) battery is always important.

I use my dslr mainly for video and if that is something you are thinking of doing there are a few things you should definitely know.I know that you have probably read so many comments and reviews that your head is spinning but fear not. What people like myself often want to know when reading a review is confirmation that they are about to make a \"good buy\". Good news you are. I recently bought the Sony and have a canon 650d, they are similarly priced cameras. I can say the Sony is far ahead in all respects bar one. There are lots of good used canon fit 2nd hand lenses. You will have to shop around for the sony fit lenses only because they are the new boys to the dslr market. That is the caution out of the way.Everything else about the sony is miles better. Did you know that Sony make the sensors (which are the important bit of a dslr) then after a year or two of using the sensor sell it to Canon etc. So the technology is newer in the Sony.Now the video bit. This camera just feels made for video. Canon and Nikon are both very flawed for video in the hands of normal people. With my canon I need to use a loupe to get it half nice to use. This Sony has an excellent evf and autofocus. Exposure , framing and focusing is so much better for video on this camera than on any other make in this price range. Do not listen to EVF (eltronic view finder) doubters on here. It is the way forward. If I had to buy another \u00a3400 camera for video tomorrow it woul be this one.

Instead, I went with the Nikon D60. I'm very happy with the D60. Its images are absolutely phenomenal--so rich and vivid.Back in those days, SLRs were cameras in the purist sense. They didn't have video capabilities, and you couldn't frame the picture by looking at the LCD screen; you had to look through the eyepiece. Those features were added with Nikon's next model, the D90, and other manufacturers have followed suit.For my second SLR, I took a risk and went with the Sony A55, the predecessor to this product. The price was good, and I was intrigued by its SLT technology. I have been extremely happy with the A55. The A57 has a lot of the same features but some differences, which I'll talk about later.Technically, the A57 (and A55) is not an SLR because there is no mirror that flips up. Instead, it has an electronic viewfinder (EVF). When you look into the viewfinder, you are looking at a small LCD screen that shows the image seen by the sensor. This is in contrast to an SLR, where the image you see in the viewfinder is reflected and refracted by mirrors and prisms directly from the lens. When the EVF technology first came out, it was a contentious issue among some of the photography community.Personally, I don't have any problems with the EVF. It's clear and bright, and you generally don't notice you're looking at a digital image rather than the direct lens image in an SLR. The only thing that makes it clear you're looking at a digital image are the optional menus and histograms superimposed on the viewfinder image. That, to me, is a big advantage of the EVF. Another advantage of the EVF is with manual focusing because the EVF and LCD can show a highly magnified view of any portion of the image you choose, so you can adjust the focus there. Also, the EVF shows 100% of the image seen by the sensor, whereas optical viewfinders on comparable SLRs typically show only ~95% of the image, cropping off the edges.Anything that can be displayed on the viewfinder can also be displayed on the LCD. So unlike my D60, you don't have to use the eyepiece. The opposite is also true--anything that can be viewed on the LCD can also be viewed on the viewfinder using the eyepiece. This is great for working outside in bright sunlight; even though the screen is still usable, looking through the viewfinder avoids glare.Speaking of the LCD screen, I love the fact that it flips out, tilts, and swivels. This is great for shooting with the camera held high overhead or close to the ground. I wish, however, that the LCD screen would flip out to the side of the camera rather than down below the camera. Because it doesn't flip out to the side, it can't be used for self-portraits when the camera is on a tripod or resting on a surface.Image quality is excellent. Although I still think my D60 has slightly better image quality, the advantages of the A57 compared to the D60 far outweigh the disadvantage in image quality. If I could only bring one of my cameras on a trip, I'd choose the A57, no question. The image quality differences becomes noticeable only if you compare photos side-by-side. I can't comment on the image quality of the A57 versus the new Nikons.If you enjoy photography scenery and landscapes, you'll love the Auto Panorama feature. It doesn't always get the stitching perfect, especially if a subject is near the camera, but it often does. When I first heard about the feature for the A55, I thought it was a gimmick. How wrong I was!One gripe about the image quality isn't with the sensor, it's with the flash. The range of the built-in flash is only 10m, less than most SLR's. My D60, for instance, is 12m.The kit lens is what you can expect for a kit lens. It has more barrel distortion than I'd like, but as I said, it's a kit lens. One disadvantage of Sony's is that they don't have the huge range of lenses that you can buy with more established camera brands. I'm a small person and never carry more than two lenses with me, however, so I don't feel so limited by the lack of available lenses.The HD video is very good. This is not a video camera, though, so you will get \"tearing\" with fast horizontal panning, but this is an issue with video on all SLRs and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras.You can use both SD cards and Sony Memory Sticks. Supposedly you can get faster write speeds using Memory Sticks, a big advantage if you do a lot of burst shooting. The Memory Sticks are pricey and can't be used with non-Sony's, so I've only used SD cards. As with all SLRs, I recommend shooting in RAW+jpeg mode, which means having a large card available.Everything I've mentioned so far applies to both the A55 and A57. So how do they differ?DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A55 AND A57The two biggest differences, for me, are the size and battery life.The A57 is considerably larger than the A55. As a small person, I prefer smaller cameras, so I didn't like this change. People with larger hands, however, may prefer the A57 because they may have trouble with the A55's buttons. Being bigger than the A55 also means being bigger than other mirrorless interchangeable lenses such as the Sony NEX. But it's a feature vs. size tradeoff. Many of the smaller cameras do not have a flip-out screen or a viewfinder. They also typically have a custom lens mount to accommodate the smaller size, which means a smaller selection of lenses, which are often more expensive.The battery life on the A55 sucked. The A57's battery life is so much better!There is no GPS feature in the A57. Though I initially thought the GPS feature was a useless gimmick, I found it extremely useful on a cross-country road trip. If you do a lot of shooting away from home, it's a valuable feature.In the A55, there was no way to operate in bulb mode without buying the remote accessory. This has been changed in the A57.Last, and in my opinion least, the maximum ISO has increased to 16000. Camera manufacturers often promote their high megapixel count and high ISO's, and it's getting ridiculous. Who really wants to shoot at ISO 16000, almost guaranteeing a mediocre at best image? Although I haven't looked at every camera, the only camera I've seen produce very usable shots out of the camera at ISO 12800 is the Fuji X100. Every camera with a higher ISO that I've seen has given unusable pictures at those numbers. So imagine what it would be with ISO 16000. In other words, a super-high ISO is a gimmick statistic that you shouldn't factor into your camera decision.BOTTOM LINE: If you have the A55, I'm not sure it's worth the upgrade. But if you're looking for a great SLR or mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, the Sony A57 should be *very* high on your consideration list.Full disclosure: I received a test model of the camera to review but was not otherwise compensated.

Here are my impressions that I hope will help you decide whether to buy this camera or not.The camera has a variety of automatic modes selectable with the dial on the left of the camera and there is no need to make this review too long. I'll hit the high points:Enhanced Intelligent auto-Turns the camera into a point and shoot like auto mode on most DSLRs. However, it will also do things like auto HDR and auto continuous shooting. This mode is very smart, I used it for outside shooting animals to inside macro shots and it takes pretty good shots almost every time. I'd say that unless you have a specific need, most of your shooting should be in this mode, especially if you're not a hardcore amateur photographer.Sweep Panorama-Want to take a shot of the grand canyon or some other vista? Just put in it this mode, hold the shoot button and sweep the camera from left to right. It does the rest, stitching them all together into a wide angle shot. It does a good job of stitching them together, but I tried this a few times in different locations and none of the panoramas  come out super sharp. I suspect this feature might work better on a tripod. Still, if you don't want to use a program or manual method to create a panorama this will work fairly well.Multi shot mode-This is where the Sony shines when compared to the other mid level cameras from Nikon and Canon. The competitors shoot at 3-5 shots a second, this A57 will machine-gun shoot at 10 a second in high quality or 12 in slightly lower (but still good) quality. I took some one handed shots of my dog flipping in the air catching a ball. They came out really nice and sharp, no blur. I'm very impressed with this feature.HD video-Full 1080 HD video with an auto-focus that actually works? You bet! It did great following my toddler around without ever getting excessively blurry.Manual mode-For those a little more into photography, there is a full manual mode. All of the manual controls are easy to access. ISO goes to 16,000 which is very nice for low light shooting without a flash.Also while not a mode I should mention that the camera does (human) facial recognition in the auto modes and it is good and keeping people's mugs in focus. If it does recognize a face it will save a second cropped portrait shot. This shot is USUALLY a good close up but this feature isn't perfect. It DOES NOT mess up the original photo, it just saves an additional one so don't worry about not having control over your shots.All in all I'm very impressed with this camera. For a non-power user like myself the auto modes do a pretty incredible job of trying to get you the perfect picture. All of the bells and whistles like sweep panorama and mutli-shot just add flexibility to that. If you're looking for a do it all DSLR camera this is probably the one to get.With all of that said, are there any downsides to the camera? A few. As I mentioned above it's a little disappointing the sweep panorama isn't ultra sharp. Compared to Nikon and Canon the Sony controls feel a little cheap/plastic. If you want to know what I mean, go handle them side by side in a retail shop. Finally the viewfinder is an LCD. Hmmm... Not sure what to make of that. It isn't as sharp as a simple lower tech through-the-lens viewfinder like you see on every other camera. It can be a little tough to view all the heads up info about lighting, ISO, etc... around the LCD which can distract you from your shooting. On the other hand, it looks like you're shooting some kind of high tech weapon system and it does a good job of showing you what it's focusing on.

Sullivan", "ReviewID": "R3EZS9ZKNWGJCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The A57K is a fine DSLR. It appears to be the second step up in the APS-C class Alpha series of cameras. The advantages it has over the A37 are few, but I would consider them significant enough to justify the added cost; on the A57 the flash recharges one second faster, the higher resolution LCD rotates and the AVCHD movie mode is capable of 1920x1080:60p, among other things.When considering buying the A57 camera or others in its class, keep in mind that the image capture quality of a smaller APS-C sensor is not equivalent to that found in a full frame DSLR, thus the affordability over one. Though other lenses will work, a lens marked with DT specifically accommodates the size of the APS-C sensor. I need to do more research before I can determine the implications of investment in higher-priced lenses that target full frame cameras over DT lenses that target APS-C and whether or not the added expense would be worth assuming that I might upgrade to a full frame camera that may use the same lenses in the future.I find the 18-55 kit lens a bit limiting. Optimal lighting consistently results in fairly sharp, colorful and beautiful shots; however, a tripod is essential for satisfactory results with lower lighting. The discounted kit price with this lens is fair in comparison to cost of the larger aperture lenses available that can take better advantage of low-light composition with minimal noise; however, both the zoom and aperture range of the 18-55 limit composition choices.The A57 has an impressive number of menu options and convenience features including separate display options for LCD and viewfinder (including a nice, HUD-like leveling display), various button assignment options and lens compensation features. The \"?\" button contextually provides descriptions of the features and options encountered while using the A57.The A57 has all the typical DSLR camera modes (check the product pages for specifics). What I like so far is the rapid fire Continuous Priority AE Mode, which can be set to capture either 12 images per second from the image center or 10 frames per second utilizing the full image. I really enjoy the panorama features that provide both horizontal and vertical panning options - due to the rapid capture, it's a feature best used in brightly lit areas. Having no 3D monitor, I have yet to try the 3D panorama mode, but I am pleased with the results of the 2D panoramas.The auto and auto plus modes work nicely, yet with no way to change the focus mode from 15-spot in these modes, I rely on the camera to choose my subject for me while focusing, and it seems to prefer selecting the most contrasting objects within range for that purpose. The Program Auto mode is the most automated mode that offers enough choices to give sufficient control to the photographer.Beside the AVCHD movie capabilities, I find it very nice that an internet-ready MP4 option at 3Mbps is available in addition to a 14Mbps MP4. I like to avoid opening my video editor to convert a clip to a reasonable size for upload.I continue to learn to better use my A57. I get noise from self-adjusted low-light shots, but the various noise reduction options and multiple exposure bracketing features are available to compensate. I would not expect breathtaking night shots (my Holy Grail, so far) from the 18-55 kit lens; however, I have had pleasing results using night scene mode which captures stars perfectly fine in the dark night sky. I need to either master the ability to replicate these settings in other modes so that I may better compose and make subtle landscapes lose their cardboard cutout appearance, or just accept that other lenses would yield better results, if that in the end were the case.The A57's photos are rich in color. It captures images nicely, but with the included lens it produces only reasonably sharp detail in areas of focus. This is a wonderfully capable camera. The Sony A57K offers far more than twice the features and capabilities, right out of box, than those of a particular point and shoot that I bought at half of its price - though I still love and use it. The A57 has much more potential when paired with the external flashes and various lenses that are available.The A57K is spectacular for portraits and memorable snapshots of basic compositions; however, for more aspiring shots I suggest adding the Sony SAL18250 Alpha DT 18-250mm Lens, or something more suitable to the cart before checkout. I always seem to want more telephoto than I can get from the 18-55, even with the camera's zoom turned on.

The sooner we quit using that term for every larger camera with interchangeable lenses, the sooner we can all start understanding photography.  SLR is a dinosaur technology, and one that prevents the user from seeing the shot they're GOING to take, before they take it, and while they're making decisions, so they can make BETTER decisions and capture more accurate and ARTISTIC photographs.True Live View (meaning in the viewfinder, not the hobbled and half-a$$ed version Canon and Nikon peddle on the LCD) is night and day better for being an artistic photographer, so on that feature alone, the Alpha SLTs greatly exceed everything they immediately compete against.But add to that better image quality, stabilized body (saving you fortune on lenses) and faster shooter speeds, and this camera would easily be worth double the price.Color, sharpness, noise control.....the a57 has EXCELLENT image quality.It's also the single most usable, artistic camera I've shot, and I've shot them all.  8 or 10 bodies each from Canon and Nikon, Pentax, Olympus, Panasonic......Put this camera on FULL MANUAL, because live view means you can SEE your exposure and white balance before you shoot...make your own decisions, and become an artist, not just a point-and-shooter.  If you're going to let the camera decide, you can grab any entry level system camera and do fine...if you want to be an artist, right now, choose SONY.Don't mess around with kit lenses....be honest with yourself, if you aren't going to spend THOUSANDS on a system, you don't WANT a system, you want a camera with just one lens.  Kit lenses are a CON...they're there to make you think you can have a pro camera for $599, but what you get is something straight south of a high end point and shoot.Get a Tamron 17-50f2.8 lens (about $400) and a Tamron 70-200f2.8 lens (about $800) and you now have an EXCELLENT system for $1700.

I also dabble in shooting local cycling events. I've owned this now for about 2 months, having purchased it from Amazon. I got the kit with the 18-135 lens. I am a long-time Nikon user and previously used a D50 with 18-55 lens and SB-600 flash. I was really interested in getting something that would have HD video. My choices boiled down to the D5100, D7000, and the A57. I really didn't intend to even look at the A57 but a trip to the big box retailer to try out the Nikons let me to pick up the A57 and see how it felt. I believe a camera purchase decision should be based on equal parts performance, features, and 'feel'. In performance and features I didn't feel there were too many differences but the 'feel' of the Sony is what sold me. The screen on the back, the EVF, the easy access to all important shooting parameters via the 'FN' button. The video seemed much easier to use as well. I may be overselling it but the Translucent mirror features seems to make composing and focusing with the rear monitor and EVF much easier on the Sony. This where I really noticed a handling difference between the cameras.I'm pretty pleased so far. I just returned from a Disney vacation with the family and it never felt too heavy or unwieldy. I bought a Case Logic wrist strap and carry it in a Mountainsmith lumbar pack. The pics and video I'm very happy with. I generally shoot in RAW + JPG but very rarely do anything with the RAWs; they are mostly a safety net if I am off on the WB or exposure. I've also purchased the F43 flash to go with it.

I am not a professional photographer (and frankly, I'm a novice just starting to learn more about cameras).  That known, I was looking for a few things in a camera.1.)  I wanted to be able to take crystal clear pictures.2.)  I wanted to be able to take pictures with moving objects without blur.3.)  I want at least the ability to have the camera take multiple shots a second.4.)  I wanted the ability to use zoom lenses as needed (this is pretty basic which most all cameras in this price range have).All of these were fulfilled.Frankly, I haven't had to learn about focusing because the auto-focus does such a good job that it hasn't been an issue.  Not only that, in good light it can refocus very well on all 12 frames it takes a second (ya, 12 frames a second).  To expand on that, it will take up to 12 frames a second when it doesn't use the built in flash.  When it has to use the built in flash that number will drastically drop to maybe 2 a second (which makes sense since it's also powering the flash).  At that point, you need another lighting option.  I was looking for a camera that I could learn how to use to take excellent photos and this camera did most of the work for me.  In a lot of cases, I don't know what I could do to make my photos better.The battery life seems to be very good.  I charged the battery two weeks ago, have taken probably 1,000 pictures with it since and still have 68% of the charge left (most of those didn't require the flash).I purchased a remote control for the camera and it also works very well.  I just had to figure out that you have to set the camera to specifically set that as input and it only works in certain modes (not auto mode).The sweep panerama feature is pretty cool.  I've found you really need good light for this.  Also, the quality of the photo isn't as good as if you took a standard photograph (I haven't been able to produce one anyway).  That said, it's simple to use and it does an excellent job of stitching the photos together (and quickly).  I can't tell by looking at the photo where the individual photos were stitched together.The quality of the video is very good.  I know that the previous model would over heat and I had heard this one would also but I took 20 minutes straight video with it and didn't have that issue (I was inside and it was air conditioned, that might be different if you were outside at a picnic in the summer).I haven't been able to test out the 3D photos capability as I don't have a 3D camera.Finally, there are so many features and settings that I haven't had the time to learn how to use.  I'm looking forward to trying them and learning about them but since the camera takes great photos out of the box I haven't had the need to yet.

Have a look at the pictures of my Focus Mares cyclo-cross bike taken with this camera and decide the quality for yourself (in the customer added pictures).For those who are torn between the Canon T3i, Nikon D5100 & this Sony A57 I would still suggest picking up the Sony over the Nikon or Canon mainly for the greatly superior auto-focus and video.  The Canon T3i has a very slow and incredibly loud auto focus, the Nikon is slightly faster but still is no comparison to the A57 which is truly fast.  When recording video the Sony also comes out ahead again because of its faster and quieter auto-focus.As for noobs like myself, it is quite helpful to you-tube some basic photography principles such as aperture, ISO, F-Stop etc.  Once you have a basic knowledge of these setting you can start using the \"M\" or full-manual mode on this camera and open up some stunning in-camera effects such as HDR, Selective Color, Pop Color, B&W;, High Contrast B&W; and my personal favorite \"Toy Camera\" (which gives a nice shadow in the corners, an effect called \"Vignetting\") while managing your exposure settings manually.  This camera is still very capable for users without a high knowledge of there manual settings.  In \"Auto\" mode it shoots great photos although sometimes they are a bit brighter than I would choose on manual.  There is also an \"Auto +\" setting which is nice but is a bit unpredictable.  This setting automatically determines what scene you are trying to shoot (i.e. HDR, portrait, landscape, sunrise/set, twilight etc) and displays its selection as you are shooting.  This setting can change very rapidly, sometimes switching between 3 or 4 scenes in a matter of seconds.  However, it is still a cool feature and usually knows what it wants to do without switching back and forth.As for disadvantages I cannot attest to any since this is the first SLR I have owned and therefore I don't have anything to compare it to other than the god-awful \"camera\" (if you what to call it that) which you get on a cell phone.  One potential disadvantage to keep in mind is the lense selection compared to Nikon and Canon.  There are certainly great lenses available however there are less to choose from and probably less on the used front.

Comparing this camera to my former Canon T2i and Nikon D5100, both similar in price, the Sony wins out in almost all areas.The Canon T2i produces excellent stills and film-like videos. But the camera's sensor overheats when shooting video, causing the camera to stop shooting. I tried three of these, plus the newer T3i, and they all did the same thing. This makes Canon  unreliable and useless for video use. When it does work, the 12 minute maximum shot length is too limiting for shooting weddings and speeches. Internal audio is crisp, but there are no controls to bypass the AGC. There is an external mike jack that provides clean audio with a good mike.The Nikon D5100 produces stills comparable to the T2i and video that is reliable, both about one stop better than the Canon. The video is a little noisy in darker parts of the image. You can plainly see the stepping action in brightness as the auto exposure control compensates for changes in light. It isn't a smooth transition. In photo mode, when shooting multiple images rapidly, the buffer will fill up fast and the shutter button will no longer operate until the buffer clears. I missed too many shots with this camera. In addition, the internal audio is very noisy and muddy, even with the four presets for AGC. The external mike jack is better than the internal mike, but it still suffers from muddy audio and AGC hiss even when using the best external mike.These shortcomings with Canon and Nikon led me to search for a better alternative, but the top end cameras were out of my budget. The Alpha 57 touted it's mirrorless technology and electronic viewfinder, so I decided to try it out. I like the electronic viewfinder, because it allows me to see the exposure in bright sunlight. I also like the video peaking mode, which lets me manually focus more easily.The first thing I noticed was how fast the stills are. I can shoot 10 shots a second in rapid fire mode, and when the buffer fills, the camera slows down to about four shots per second rather than stopping altogether like the Nikon. Let up on the shutter button for a second, and the buffer reloads for another two dozen rapid shots. I can live with this. The quality of the stills is nearly as good as the other cameras, the only difference being that when you pixel peep, the grain that looks like film grain in the Nikon and Canon looks a little more squared off in the Alpha. You'll never see this in a 16x20 print, however.The Alpha video file mode is a welcome surprise. Rather than shoot strictly MOV files, the Alpha allows you to select MP4 or AVCHD files in 24, 30 or 60 frames per second. These files are much more efficient in file size while maintaining similar compression quality, allowing over three hours of video on a 32 Gig card. Also, the per shot limitation is 30 minutes rather than 12 for the Canon or 20 for the Nikon. This opens up the camera for more video use. Quality wise, the video is much cleaner in low than either the Canon or Nikon, and you can manually select the video ISO, white balance, iris and shutter speed, something neither the Canon or Nikon can do. There are many more features I like on this camera, such as the extreme amount of manual white balance control with it's dial-in color balance capability. With the step-up 16-50 lens at F2.8 throughout the entire zoom range, the low light video capability indoors is astonishing, even compared to my 4000 dollar Panasonic AC130 camcorder. The low light capability in still twilight mode is so good, I was able to capture razor sharp images of star constellations in the night sky shooting a short exposure hand held. Both Canon and Nikon require a tripod mounted 30 second exposure to match what the Sony can shoot hand held.The audio is very good with the internal mikes with very little AGC pumping. The AGC is smooth and barely noticeable. The external mike jack provides clean audio, with the same smooth AGC action. Normal speech sounds very natural with no objectionable extra hiss or pumping.My biggest gripe with the Sony Alpha series is the non-standard hot shoe. Yes, I bought an adapter, but really? Why deviate from the decades old industry standard shared by every other manufacturer? Sony saw the way with the next year Alpha models, changing their hot shoe back to the accepted standard. In the video mode, there tends to be a narrow range of conditions where bright, shiny objects such as a detailed metal picture frame in direct sunlight tend to show some compression artifacts. But in normal video scenes, the image is crisp and clean.In short, the Alpha 57 meets my needs for a solid performer in both the still and video modes. Is it the best for both? Within it's 750 dollar price range, I think so. A high end Canon or Sony will probably outperform this Alpha by a bit, but those benefits will come at more than four times the price. For me, the Alpha 57 is the best compromise between performance and price, in both still and video modes.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderfully Amazing camera", "Author": "Jenna G.", "ReviewID": "R1QF5IA1AGRFS7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say that even before I purchased this camera I was impressed with the direction that the Sony camera line was headed in. My first real digital SLR experience came only a few years ago, when I purchased a Sony a390 based primarily on the cost.  That camera instilled a real passion for photography with in me and launched me into a nice little photography side business. Unfortunately, it became damaged in a kayaking mishap (Yikes!) and I was forced into replacing it.  By this time I was biased toward Sony products, but I researched all the major \"more elite\" brands and tried many of the more expensive Nikon and Canon models. It came down to when you compare cost and features the A57 stands above the rest.  This camera is amazing. It's easy enough for a beginner to operate and get good results from with-in a few minutes of familiarity. It features an easy menu screen with many settings that an amateur can use while remaining in auto-mode, as well as many more advanced manual settings. The portrait mode not only provides the original photo of the subject, but will frame your subject, as to the photography rule of thirds, providing 2 photos to chose from.  The camera will shoot at 12fps and in some modes will take continuous photos of your subject forming a composite by combining the shots into the best possible photo.  This enables Sony to provide a remarkable hand held night setting. I'm primarily a landscape photographer, so the panoramic feature blew me away. The eyepiece and screen work together, showing not only a clear true to life preview of your subject, but a copy of the photo you just took.  I can not comment at this time on night time photography, a drawback to the a390 model, as I have not had the opportunity.  I'm also one of those people who see no reason for the video option and quite frankly I wish it was not included. I have taken well over 1,000 pictures to date with this camera, and I seem to get about 5 to 600 photos per battery charge. There are only 2 drawbacks I see to this camera. One, is the range of the lens provided with the camera.  It does fine with most everyday photography, but for capturing objects far away it is inadequate.  The second drawback unnerves me.  Why can't Sony provide a lens cap strap to their camera? I realize there must be reasons for spending thousands of dollars on a camera.

I read reviews at length, for weeks, before settling on this model and I am so glad both to have made an informed choice and to have that choice proven in reality now that I've had the camera in hand and used it.  The a57 is more complicated than a DSLR, with dependent inter-relationships across both common and novel functions and priorities.  The a57 is not point & shoot; it's more like a lump of clay, that sees you as a lump of clay as well.  If you know what you want from both a visual and a technical perspective and have the right lens for it, the a57 will get you there.  If you have blind spots now, but want to learn to be a competent all-around amateur DSLR photographer, then this is your gateway drug.  The a57 doubles as an excellent digital photography tutor, and will help you build understanding and skills every step of the way.  The Sony way, that is. If you just want a pro-looking DSLR with a big black lens that makes impressive clicky noises on the 50 yd line, but is otherwise a simple point-and-shoot, then look elsewhere.  In its' various Auto modes the a57 can serve as the King Tiger tank of point-and-shoot; the issue is that a novice to the camera could select settings or lenses that counter this functionality and then become lost, with mixed end results. The user may not realize dependencies to a setting in some other menu area (where was that, the Menu menu or the Function menu, or wait was I in Movie Mode, or did I hold down the ISO button then roll the knob...?), and one could spend time puzzling over why it's not doing now what it did before, when you're in some manual mode rather than auto.  If you haven't done the reading, which I will mention further on,  you may find it hard to keep the dependencies straight.  When in doubt, reinitialize!  In the more manual modes, there are several of these newly arrived Sony tech settings that can throw you off and I'm not talking fstop vs shutter speed, the rabbit hole goes way deeper on this camera.  Sony has introduced new concepts and approaches to a pro DSLR while also attempting to maintain \"point & shoot ease\" and though this camera succeeds at the former two it is initially at least, a fascinating & robust failure at the latter.  Works fine though, if one devotes the head space to learning some new feature concepts.  Do that, think through your shots and vids first, and this camera will reward you handsomely for the effort. Rolling the dice WITHOUT first reading the manual (THIS manual btw, thanks to TCav of Steve's Digicams forum for the link: [...oops please do a search]), will probably result in some mediocre shots at first.Note that the a57 can take (and I'm doing it) the quality Minolta a mount AF lenses that you can find cheap on Ebay. It amuses, considering that many reviews argue that there aren't sufficient lenses for this camera, when there dozens of pages full of reasonably priced Minoltas, Tamrons etc. that will work with this lens. I got myself a Tamron 90x300, a Minolta 50mm f1.7 prime and an Abeline 500mm for less than $230 including shipping!  So if you like to play around and really test to see what works for you there is an abundance of lenses available, from fish-eye to macro to 4000mm tele zooms on Ebay.  Keep in mind though, that there's an approximately 1.4X mag factor on these lenses which is going to change your field of view compared to what you might normally expect - a Minolta 50mm f1.7 lens perfect for tight interiors, is gonna be a 70mm lens and you may notice that difference.  You also have to remember that the 300mm you are reading on the lens is actually 714mm, etc.  A labelmaker would resolve that issue.  I got my a57 with the 18x55mm kit lens and I have no complaints thus far.  The kit lens is solid but not overly heavy.  If it's plastic like the body is, as some reviews have written, then it is a metal-like plastic.  It seems more like aluminum to me, but there is little relevance in plastic vs. metal at this level of product engineering. Consider that this is an SLT rather than a true DSLR, for instance.  Since there is no mirror-flipping going on for every focus instance, that vibration common to DSLR's is not existent in this camera.  This means that the camera does not have to wait around for itself until the mirror has stopped vibrating, before it can image again.  And this means, faster finger press to shutter releases, and continuous photo bursts in shorter timeframes. So, even if metal were a more stable material for a body (which, at this level of engineering, I rather doubt), that is hardly helpful when you still have to wait around while your mirror vibrations dissipate through that metal body before you can image again. To say nothing of being able to autofocus real-time continuously while taking 1920X1080P 60P video!The 1.4 firmware update is out, you would want to snag that, just because.The camera has a cool target reticule, that indicates pitch and roll alignment of the camera body, like a built-in level.  Since the display can be folded out and around, this does help to maintain a level shot in these awkward positions.One cool, new-to-me feature, is what Sony calls Peaking Level for manual focus.  When set to manual focus and with 3 settings, low medium & high, the Live Display (which generally shows the final picture live all of the time, essential) shows a fine pixelated wash across the image, in a plane that IS the actual focal plane of the lens cutting through the 3-dimensional image space, so you move the focus out and this plane of (I choose white) pixelation occurs across the image telling you precisely where the focal plane is hitting!  You don't even have to see the fine elements of what you are shooting.  Fantastic! For instance, one of my cats is black, so he is a black blob in the viewfinder or display. But with Peaking Level, I can clearly see delineation as to where his nose is, then whiskers, then the surface of his eyeballs, as the Peaking Level effect illustrates the focal plane's position as it moves in - and I take the shot when the white noise is where I want the focus to be. You do need 2 hands, to use this feature.  And to be clear, this is not one of the \"3-D panorama\" features of the camera.  I have not used the 3-D panorama or panorama features as yet.The a57 feels solid and heavy, as one would expect.  I picked up a Nikon D6 the other day and it felt like a toy in comparison to the a57.  Even my Casio EX-FH20 Super Zoom felt more solid than the D6 actually, not that I have anything against Nikon.  Just saying, build quality should matter.  The image that you take is more important than the image that you want to project as a \"serious photographer,\" ha ha...The a57 sports myriad display symbols within multiple configuration menus, all of which you will have to learn in order to interface with it.  This camera takes on the bushel of both tool and tutor, and its' abundance of menus does reflect that.  Now that the world has not ended, any familiarity with Mayan hieroglyphic script will find new application as one works through understanding the functionality of this camera.  Hey I did it, and learned a lot in the process.  The tutorial aspect of the camera is somewhat separated from the controls aspect, so you don't have to constantly work through menus full of advice to get where you need to be.  It is there if and when you need it.  I found it helpful mostly for understanding the new concepts and terminology that Sony labs have come up with, in advancing the field of digital photography.  I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for other companies to figure it out, when many are after all, buying sensors made by Sony to use in their own \"cutting edge\" cameras.Take it slow with the a57; the amount of information needing assimilation, will overwhelm anyone so take it task by task, in stages.  I find connecting the HDMI out to my flat screen TV, lessens the tedium of the small display.  I learned the camera (and still do) in 'study sessions' on the big flat screen.  You see the complete display on the flat screen monitor, in both movie and pic mode.  I'm experiencing macular degeneration for the first time (joy) due to age, and have recently begun using readers, so I rely on the diopter-adjusted viewfinder when taking stills, but for me studying menu settings of a digital camera for long periods, through the viewfinder, is an added strain that I do not want.  It certainly works, but learning on the flat screen is much easier.  You can toggle back & forth between your camera's HDMI in to the TV, and the .pdf a57 manual on your computer's input to the TV for instance, for learning ease.  You can even go picture-in-picture.The autofocus system is fast, and great for video, particularly when you learn all of the autofocus modes and settings and creatively apply that understanding to your project.  You can deliberately pace & plan your pans, to take advantage of this amazingly snappy autofocus capability.  You may have read reviews that complain of the a57's limited manual controls over video when in autofocus - there is a little switch on the lens that says AF MF. Just set it to MF and focus manually, if you find yourself trying to use AF in an MF environment.  If you aren't good at manual focus for pictures, use the Peaking feature.  You will get better.There is even an unlabeled 'mystery button' on the camera.  Now, any cold-blooded, dyed-in-the-wool amateur photographer would have immediately asked what the little button on the bottom of the a57 is for.  I did, and it is the Preview button.  If you push this near-unnoticeable button while in Auto Aperture, it will display for you the full depth of field effect of the shot, with the blurred fore-and background to either side of the focal plane.  I am still testing this, as I can already clearly see depth of field in the WYSIWYG display/viewfinder.There are lots of APS-C sensors out there. The a57's APS-C sensor has comparatively good sized individual sensors, which is just one small part of all of the tech working together in the a57 to result in great video and picture quality.  I know of no camera that works harder to get at what you want, if you know what it is that you want to get to in the first place, that is...The a57 records in AVCHD 60P, and is about the only DSLR under a grand that can do that, apart from the other Sony's, like the a65, a77 & a99.  And that is what I needed, and it works.  I can rewrap and convert footage on my Macs w/no issue between Free MTS M2TS Converter, JES Deinterlacer & MPEG Streamclip, and get 50% frame rate reduction that way for good HD slow motion, though I can't watch the AVCHD natively on my Macs (no need to yet). I can watch a57 footage via VLC player, but with a stream rate of 26Mbps, my Macs are better at editing than AVCHD playback anyhow, and what I do is use Toast 11 with the Blu Ray plugin to burn to Blu Ray disc if I'm not going to a lesser stream rate.  Toast 11 is stable and provides the option of crude Blu Ray menus if you need that for weddings and such, and it's not expensive.  The a57 has a separate button for recording video, not the shutter button; it took me all of 2 tries to set that difference to memory.  You can disable the button, if your fingers are in a constant and unknowledgeable flail.  I've never had a problem with it and even if I did, I wouldn't call that a problem as I have actual real problems in life to deal with. As with any camera new to you, there will be subtle and not-so-much subtle differences.Low light performance is all there with the kit lens.  I find that the kit lens has a little stiction in the zoom but there is an element of my own inexperience involved here; hand muscle memory for stylish manual video zooms is something that has to be worked at anyhow.The a57 is only dust sealed, not weather so one should have a rain sleeve in their bag just in case.Battery life is long with the camera.  Though it doesn't have GPS, I happen to have a Pentax WG-2 GPS for that.  The Sony a65 at about $200 more than the a57, has GPS that I believe tags every video key frame with GPS data, if you need that.  Double-check first before picking one up, it's just what I read.  If I thought the a65 were a better camera overall, I would have bought one of them, but 24mp is a lot of video color data and though I wasn't certain it would be a factor in post processing I'm happy to have avoided that possibility.  The a77 though weather sealed, is a lot of money and some users have noted sloppy knobs after significant use cycles; I can't attest to that but since I can't afford an a77 anyhow, I am indifferent to the issue.I can't comment on the on-board stereo audio recording capability, haven't needed it yet - but there is a stereo mini plug jack to connect an external microphone.  I haven't been paying ANY attention to sound yet and that bit me in the boo boo recently as I learned from a colleague that a slow motion test of mine had slowed audio, that then cut out halfway through the video leaving silence for the remainder!  Of course I had expected the audio would be played back at 1/2 speed, but I did not anticipate the truncation.  When I get to the point of working with on-board camera audio in a project, I hope to remember to post my impressions of it here.The a57 is dust sealed however the sensor cleaning is accomplished through vibration cycles.  I find that a bit unnerving and so I try to carefully prep when swapping out lenses; if swapping where you can ground out static electricity with a wrist ground strap that might be worth the bother; setting down a lens on a surface with a pre-existing static charge and dust, could cause a static attraction with dust lifted to the lens that could then become pulled in to the camera sensor if the camera were differently charged than the lens, and we don't want that. The sensor can do 16X9 or 4X3; in 16X9 you are not using the whole sensor, but since full HD is only 2.1Mp or so anyhow the subset of this 16MP sensor is sufficient.  I have been running in 16X9 but then I mostly shoot video with it.  The low light capability, short focal length of the 18X55 lens, huge sensor (comparative to camcorder) and enormous fun of playing with depth of field in video, and smooth realtime video autofocus make the a57 just hugely fun to plan and shoot video with, and there is a uniqueness to DSLR video shot with this feature set.  It's a frontier camera, but sans weather sealing, not perhaps a camera FOR the frontier.About the viewfinder, it is a full WYSIWYG so you don't have to push down the button halfway to know what you're dealing with, in most instances.  And you don't have to look from the viewfinder to the display all of the time to change settings, it's all on whichever you want.  It has diopter adjustment which is a big help for those of us who need it.The feature set is so rich with this camera and I haven't done it justice but you can read of the camera's excellence in other reviews.  I will update this review occasionally, as I learn more about the a57.  It is now my primary camera.Thanks for reading, hope this helps you to make an informed choice.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS!!", "Author": "S.

Let me state up front that I shoot mostly still pics (not video), and mostly through the viewfinder (not the LCD screen), so my comments will not address the video capacity or LCD screen of the a57.  But it is the best of all my cameras for taking still pics through the viewfinder.It has an Electronic View Finder (EVF), like the Nex-7 does, but unlike the a700 and a100 that rely on Optical View Finder (OVF).  The essential reason that I prefer EVF over OVF is that it presents \"live view\" to the eye, i.e., shows what the camera's sensor is \"seeing.\"  It is also possible to display the exposure/brightness histogram on the EVF when composing a shot, and this makes it possible to adjust the five main components of picture quality: white balance, ISO, aperture, shutter and exposure compensation and to see the effect on the EVF image that changing any of these five components make to the picture about to be taken.So, both the Nex-7 and the a57 share the capacity to display histogram and live view through an EVF, so why do I still prefer the a57 over the Nex-7?  While the Nex-7 is superb for landscapes, portraits, low-light, it doesn't do big sporting events as well due to using contrast-detection auto-focus that is somewhat slower than the phase-detection auto-focus of the a57.  Plus, the a57 but not Nex-7 has steady-shot image stabilization and can shoot the long focal length alpha-mount lenses (e.g., 300mm and 400mm) that are so often essential for such long-distance shooting.  While the Nex-7 can be equipped with an adapter (LA-EA2) that enables it to \"simulate\" an a57 and to use all alpha-mount lenses, nonetheless the a57 still has the advantage because its in-camera image stabilization is NOT available via the LA-EA2 adapter.And now that I have found my favorite camera, what does Sony go and do...they discontinue the a57!  So, get them while they last and at such attractive close-out prices,  because the a57 will no longer be made, along with all the other Sony alpha-mount cameras (a33, a37, a55, a57, a58, a65, a77, and a99) that depend on the technology called SLT (single lens translucent mirror).", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera - great support", "Author": "Arlington J.

The first one was put through it's paces. I take pictures for my school's yearbook and website. I have taken thousands of pictures with it. Then, one day, the dreaded \"camera error\" that other people have mentioned. I sent the camera to Sony repair (on my dime) but the repair was covered under warranty and in less than two weeks it was back at work. I received two calls from the Sony repair center keeping me updated. Their service was exemplary.As for the camera - it does what I need it to do. Outdoor pictures of soccer, baseball and softball - great indoor shots for concerts, musical and plays - and I really like the video quality. I added an external microphone (to eliminate the noise created by the focusing of the camera) and took some great clips at a recent musical performance.Is this \"pro\" level? Maybe not - but it has handled all I have thrown at it and done quite well. I have used Minolta/Sony cameras for well over a decade and this has turned into my favorite camera.

Some tests show Nikon having better performance in dark. But I found them to be negligible. T4i has nothing going for it besides the touch-screen. A dubious feature for such a small display to begin with.I shoot mostly landscape and skatepark. In both cases the camera is superb. I've never seen 10fps burst rate until this. And, man, oh man, is it awesome. 1080p/60fps video with continuous, quiet auto-focus from the SLT lens is remarkable.

About 1/4 of my shots are taken with the screen off-base.The only feature I find lacking is the OVF. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly usable. But at first glance, the pixels are quite obvious. I got used to it with time. Would love to have the OLED screen that's available in the higher end models. But I understand that you can't have everything for $680 (what I paid for 18-135 SLT kit).And as far as lenses go, I find that with Sony, Tamron, and Sigma products, there is a lens for every occasion.

It was amazing features that allow you to do some truly incredible things. First, what kind of consumer am I? I would consider myself an enthusiast photographer, I love having a DSLR (in this case a DSLT), composing my own photographs, but I am not about to start charging people for my services and unrefined skills. It is a great hobby of mine. I spent the equivalent of a few days (over several weeks) reading reviews, comparing, and learning about technologies before making my purchase.Sony really has been making leaps and strides in the their higher-end cameras, both the Alpha and the NEX lines. When considering cameras I was actually leaning towards the NEX-5N. I have had a Sony A100 since they were first released and, while I love it, I was very drawn to the small and sleek form factor of the NEX. It wasn't until I got a store and handled each of them and tested some of their abilities up-close that I (without any warning or looking back) chose the A57 over the NEX-5N. I am VERY satisfied with my choice.I have had the A57 for about a week now and have been blown away. The Multi-frame NR, Auto HDR, DRO, Panorama, and 12 FPS features of the camera are my favorites so far. They make taking photographs that you may not otherwise get, or have the time to properly compose/post produce SO easy! It is amazing how many useful features this camera has, ones that are far more refined than just a bunch of cheap point & shoot gimmicks for casual picture takers. The image quality of the camera is fantastic, colors are faithfully reproduced. The Auto WB may need a little tweaking now and again, but for the most part, that works great as well. The camera itself feels solid and of quality construction. Having a larger body, over the A55, is a very welcomed change.One thing that I am getting used to is having to frequently check to see if I have any of the many multi-frame functions turned on. The first couple days I kept forgetting that I had turned on the HDR or Multi-frame NR (through the ISO) for a previous shot and would end up finding out the camera again wanted to take six shots when I was only ready for and expecting a single shutter release. I have had to be constantly aware of the settings I am using; when I turn them on, and when i turn them off.Overall, I am extremely happy with this camera and with Sony. I plan to stick with them over Canon, Nikon, or Pentax for the next long while. Sony really has been raising the bar on what it means to be a truly DIGITAL-SLR and they are doing a fantastic job. I have and will continue to recommend this camera over its competitors, even those in the prosumer and semi-professional categories.UPDATE: Still love the camera! One thing Canon just added to the 7D as a firmware update was a user-limited Auto ISO. This adds a surprising amount of control and flexibility.

I am really happy after purchasing this great item. It has :* Great IQ & Video. One of the best & well tested Sony Image Sensor used in this camera.* Dedicated ISO, White Balance, Self timer  and other dedicated buttons. Without dedicated buttons it take little a bit time to change those setting.* EVF is \"you get, what you see\". This really great sometimes even in manula mode camera told me the correct exposure but EVF was showing a bit underexposed image. Decreased shutter speed a stop and got the correct exposure. We can't do this so easily in Canon or Nikon.Also, EVF can shows all the camera menu & setting. This way no need to look at the lcd to get the details.EVF shows rule of thirds grid lines, diagonal lines, labels etc. I don't think all these available in any one Canon-Nikon Camera (at least not in this price range)* Inbuilt AF motor in Body so I can use all the lens (including the lens lacking auto focus motor). Canon & Nikon does not have inbuilt autofocus motor in their camera for this price range.* Auto portrait cropping. I did not find it great still Ok.* Battery life is good compared to a55.* Dual memory card support (SD & Memory stick). (I know :) who will use sony memory stick ;) still if someone want to use they can use it.Now some of the negatives :* ISO, WB & other settings are carried over from Aperture priority/other settings to Manual mode. eg. If ISO set to 200 in Aperture priority mode and if the mode shiwched to manual default ISO is showing 200. Actually manual mode should have default iso set to base (100). WB also has same issue.* Body & Kit lens material looks a bit cheap to me compared to Nikon.* Can't set the max ISO limit in Aperture priority mode. Eg. If ISO set to auto then camera can choose any ISO 100 to max, Nikon D5100 we can set max ISO for auto ISO, this way we can instruct camera not to go beyond say 1600 ....* Kit lens focusing has difficulty focusing in some normal focusing condition. Sometimes lens dancing back & forth to achive focus.* Images taken on Low light is better than many SLRs but still normal indoor house photography need faster lens like f/1.8 or better.I will try to update the review soon.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazingly Phenomenal !", "Author": "P.

The features give more bang for the buck than any other camera in it's class. It's a shame that Sony discontinued it, as it is head and shoulders above the a58. The trade off in camera quality and shooting speed is not worth the extra megapixels, especially if they end up being essentially useless.The .jpg engine could definitely use an overhaul, and the kit lens...well, it's a kit lens. Get yourself a nifty fifty prime, and you'll end up with the best photos you've ever taken. The low light capabilities are absolutely superb, and you can push this camera into the higher ISO ranges without an obscene amount of noise. The button layout is sensible and easy to learn and operate.The video on the a57 is stellar. It shoots in full HD and allows you to capture stills while filming. You can also film in full manual mode, which is great for those that want to get better control of their subject matter.The viewfinder is nothing short of amazing and allows a 100% field of view. Basically, whatever you see through your viewfinder ends up in your photos. Many other DSLRs in this price range offer subpar viewfinders that end up giving cropped versions of your images.The abundance of automated features on this camera are great to learn from, but the real jewel in the feature set is the Sweep Panorama mode. By far the easiest to use of any camera in any class. You just press the shutter and swing the camera around. No trying to line up inside a series of onscreen dots or any of that goofy stuff. This is just point, press and swing around. It provides amazing results, too.If you're looking for a light, easy to tote camera, I wouldn't recommend this little beast, as it's pretty hefty. The a37 might be better for an everyday carry type camera, if you absolutely need one of the SLT series cameras. The NEX series is also great for everyday shooting and portability.I've had my a57 for three months now, and I've shot a few thousand photos with it. It's a fantastic camera, and despite the fact that it's been discontinued, it will remain a solid camera that will provide outstanding results for years to come.

One feature that I'm in love with is the focus magnifier - it allows you to use the preview button that is conveniently in reach when you're holding the camera for a shot. When enabled in the settings, it enlarges an area of your image so that you can more precisely adjust your focus, and you can change the area that is zoomed in case you wish to have your focal point stray from the center of the frame. This button can also be changed to preview your selected aperture, etc. In any case, the auto and scene modes on the camera are great too. If you are a newcomer and want a camera that will be easy to use that will also grow along with you at a good cost, I'd say you should go for this one! I think more experienced photographers are also likely to find this camera satisfying.Also, shortly after buying I realized I wanted to expand my lens collection, as the lens is just as important for image quality as the camera body is. Here are some lenses I ended up buying or considering heavily (be sure to compare prices on ebay vs. amazon, it's a coin toss as to where you'll fetch the better price and this can change daily).For a great zoom lens: (I found it muuuuch cheaper on Ebay - fast and quiet autofocus with good image quality)http://www.amazon.com/Sony-SAL18135-18-135mm-3-5-5-6-Zoom/dp/B00836H3Z8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1368729442&sr;=8-1&keywords;=sony+18-135Portrait lens: (Also found much cheaper on Ebay, and this lens is unbelievably sharp and fantastic for low-light non-flash photography.

The camera is very easy to use and intuitive.  I purchased the body and Tamaron 18-270 lens.  The key factors for our family was the ability to shoot high frame rates (sports), great video, and simple and easy to use.  The Tamron lens is very versatile allowing us to not need to change lenses ever (easy & simple).  The camera is really fast (12 frames / sec) which is pretty good when shooting the action of my kids sports games.  The one thing that that is a downside to this camera is that when shooting at high frame rates the viewfinder does not show a live view but rather the stills as the camera takes them.  It makes it a little difficult to keep the camera on the subject.Some of the unexpected nice things I discovered:- The auto portrait has actually worked really well.  Sometimes I like the original but it does a really good job with it.- The auto focus during high speed shots is very good at following / tracking the subject even with a narrow field of view.  I got to test this over the weekend during flag football where there could be 5 or more kids in the shot but the focus would remain on the ball carrier.  Sometimes it would jump around but it was pretty accurate most of the time.- The lessons within the camera (pressing the \"?\" button) is a nice touch for beginners.- The \"no flash\" dial position is very convenient during those times you simply want to disable the flash in a hurry- Being able to record video at any time regardless of what mode the camera is in.I would purchase this again and I have not issues recommending this camera.I chose this camera over the A58 for:- the speed (12 fps vs 8 fps)- buffer space (25 frames vs 7)- video options (1080 @ 60p/24p vs. 1080 @ 60i/24p only)- LCD screen can twist and fold downThe new A58 does have a clearer OLED viewfinder but it's a smaller screen.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "More than fulfilled expectations", "Author": "Sandra Samuelson \"Scrutiny\"", "ReviewID": "R2RFIW0MADJRJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Getting spectacular pictures with Tamron 28-75 mm f2.8 zoom and Tamron 90 mm f2.5 macro lenses.

I have typically gravitated toward \"prosumer\" level stuff. My last camera was (is) a Canon 20D, which I still love. So why go Sony? I was intrigued by the high FPS offered by the EVF/SLT design. I shoot a lot of sports for my kids and 12FPS was a huge enticement. I was on the fence between the A57 and the A65 with the OLED EVF, but when the price dropped with the introduction of the A58, I couldn't wait. So far I have been pretty happy. The pictures are as sharp and crisp as I expect, controls are easy to use and figure out, and focus is fast and accurate. In camera functions and creative modes are pretty neat. \"Serious\" photographers will dismiss these as gimmicks as they are all things you can do later in PS, but if you value your time and just want to get the shot straight from the camera to your computer without a lot of messing around they can be very useful. The one thing I thought that I was going to dislike is the flip up/down rear screen, vice flip to side. Now that I have the camera I have to say flip up/down is better. Shooting low/high is much easier with a flip up/down than flip to side and rotate. The down side is you can't put it on a tripod and flip it around to the front, but you do a lot more shooting up/down than tripod self portraits (well, I do anyway). It does use an electronic viewfinder vice a pentaprism. This has advantages and disadvantages. Advantages- a lot more information can be displayed, gives you a view of what the sensor sees, allows multiple focus modes, shows instant display of the picture you just took, less noise/camera shake. Disadvantage - Not a pentaprism, grainy in low light, Not direct through the lens to your eye. I thought this would bother me, but it doesn't.Pro: Fast continuous shooting, good sensor, good in-camera effects, easy controls, fast accurate autofocus,Con: Feels a little light, no top panel LCD, not made by the Big Two (if you care about that), proprietary hot shoePro and con: EVF vice pentaprism", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great except for viewfinder.", "Author": "Todd J.

I am very happy with the performance in all those areas.  A couple things that I did not expect were the ability of this camera to capture minor differences in shading.  The D90 seems to have lower default contrast and a tendency to slightly overexpose, but even after adjustments the increased shading detail of the Sony can be amazing.  Secondly, I knew this camera was highly regarded for video performance, but it is amazing.  The camera picks up some noise from the autofocus, but the video is like a high definition nature show.  I have a Sony HD camcorder.  This is much better.  With that said, I will stick with the Nikon as a system.  The viewfinder is useful only to frame the picture.  I could never manually focus or even tell if the autofocus worked properly by looking through the view finder.

I went through a few point and shoots until I bought a DSC-HX1. While the lens and other features of that camera were amazing, I was still dissatisfied with the lack of depth of field, the resolution, and image noise (and noise processing). It was the right combinations, but the not the image quality I wanted. I knew that I would need to jump up in image sensor size (the HX1 had a terribly small sensor, about 1/4 of the size of the APS-C) and with my other Minolta gear and familiarity with the Sony features, I decided to check out the Alphas.I started learning more about the A37, but felt I wouldn't be completely happy with it. For about $100 more for the body, the A57 offers a larger battery, sharper screen, larger body size, 1080P 60fps video, etc. To me, that's a better value considering that this is a camera that I want to keep a long time. So far, I've taken about 1000 pictures, and the image quality is fantastic, everything I wanted it to be. The included software is a nice upgrade from the older Sony PMB. The kit lens is 200x better than the 20 year old Tamron that I owned, so I will be using that from now on, or at least until I can afford a nicer lens. (In a nutshell, the $100 kit lens is well worth the money if you don't have existing lenses). Because I was familiar with the operation of the HX1 already, I was enjoying all of the features of the A57 almost immediately.If you're on the fence about buying a new DSLR or SLT camera, take a very careful look at the Sony Alphas.

I mostly use Canon cameras and once you pick a brand your kind of stuck with it once you buy accessories because they are not cheap.  I did pick up a cheap off brand back up battery and remote, both surprising doing very well.  I started out using the auto features which it has plenty of, and they do a fine job. While I do like the panoramic feature, I had issues with it telling me I was moving to fast then to slow, and while shooting scenes with hand rails in it, the rail is noticeably chopped into dozens of squares, but when it gets it right, which is most of the time, it is a nice feature and no pasting it together back at the pc.  What is the point of owning a camera like this if your not going to play around a bit, night time storm and astronomy photos look good, I got wonderful lightening photographs of a night time storm cell and 15-30 second star photos turn out. Long exposures of star trails turn out with out too much noise.  How ever long you hold the shutter open is pretty much how long you have to wait while it processes before you can take another. The close up photos with the supplied lens are decent enough you wouldn't need to invest it a macro lens for your basic close ups. The day time shots are excellent, I took dozens of photographs of a butterfly landing on a flowering bush in the wind, so many of the shots turned out so nice I had trouble picking which one I wanted to print. Out in the south sunny west, I ended up with far more sun flare during vacation then I am use to, so I will be investing in a lens hood.It took me a while to get use to the massive menu, but I can now work most of the camera even in the dark, I think I was just use to the Canons. Its kind of noisy, a guy next to me at the Grand Canyon said, \"you won't be sneaking up on any critters with that one.\" And I myself while waiting for a sunset heard a girl using this same camera take her panoramic sweep.I used both memory stick pro and SD class 10 cards, I could not tell any difference.I know my review points out a few things I would like better, but I give it the 4 star because it does a good job and I am happy with it, I like that it can use off brand accessories without issue so I can put the money where it counts, into the lens.4/13 I had to come back and update this to a five star.

After two months of playing with it almost daily, I think I can now do a fairly good job of it.What's in the box?You get the camera, body cap, 18-55mm kit lens, strap, battery & charger and a usb cable.  It would have been nice to include a rear lens cap for the lens, but those are cheap enough I picked a few up elsewhere.  You will also need to provide the SDHC card.Stills:This camera takes awesome, clear, sharp and beautiful stills at 16.1 MP.  The shutter speed is fast, press the button and your picture is captured.  The A57 takes pictures as fast as you can press the button.  Auto-focus mode takes all the guesswork out of shots.

Caruso \"The Happy Aspie\"", "ReviewID": "R1VENU8PXAGNKN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I moved up to the Sony Alpha A57 from the A300 (A DSLR, without the SLT thing).I love the A57.  If you are looking for a camera that can function as a fairly automatic camera, but is more fully featured than a pocket point and shoot, this could work.  It excels in that it has enough of the \"big camera\"/pro-features and exchangeable lenses that a budding photographer can really grow their skills and the quality of their work without outgrowing the A57.Immediately, I adored the A57 and stopped using the A300 as the A57 had easier, more intuitive design and feature access.  The screen was bigger and clearer and the swivel, tilt of the LCD was also, more intuitive than the somewhat clumsy A300 tilt.  I need reading glasses, but I shoot mostly outdoors, and I'm not a fan of my bifocals, so the screen's flexibility, clarity, and brightness allowed me to shoot thousands of photographs without having to locate my sunglasses with the bifocal lenses.  I know, I could use the viewfinder.  I have, for the past 20 years of photography experience, avoided viewfinders and prefered using the screens as it's easier to sneak candids of people, I like a nice low angle, and I had cataracts at age 19 and until this year, I had never successfully used a viewfinder to accurately frame and focus.I went, at the beginning of 18 months, from shooting only using autofocus (due to me not trusting my eyes as the last time I seriously shot regularly (200+ pics a week) I was in film school, had the cataracts, and everything came back from the lab out of focus.  My eyes are fine now but I guess they are a little camera shy, albeit on the other side of the camera instead of as subject.)  to shooting almost only with manual focus, manual shutter speed selection, and manual aperture.  My images have gone from what I thought were pretty good macros of jewelry and the occasional flower, and candids of my kid, to the point where I feel like I should recall the book of photographs I printed for my aunts because what I thought was good and impressive and creative and high quality has been blown out of the water as my skills have developed with the safety nets and countless options available on the A57.The kit lens isn't too bad.  For someone with beginning to moderate abilities, it is satisfying and when it stops satisfying the photographer and he/she starts \"pixel peeping\", there are many other lens options available.  The 18-55 lens is very lightweight and I used it mostly as a walkabout when staying in the neighborhood and it wasn't until recently that I started craving the crispness and speed of prime lenses and some of the cult favorites detailed on Alpha mount focused sites.  The images with this lens are \"good enough\" and I have had a few that are spectacular, but more a combo of circumstances and settings making up for any deficits in the lens.  I was happy with the kit lens for quite some time.The only problem I have had with this camera is the memory card slot.  At around 16 months, and almost 9000 images, the slot started eating SD cards...It started with a snack of a few micro SD to SD adapters and then SD cards and then it moved onto memory sticks (the half-sized ones, not the ones that are sized like a piece of fruit stripe gum).  Apparently, the A57 memory card slot was famished.  Eventually, it stopped accepting SD cards completely and would only accept the memory stick duo until it had enough and now it won't accept and register any card.  (note:  if this happens to you, DO NOT think you can just pop the back off the camera and fix the memory card slot yourself.  Just send it in for repair and let the pros monkey with it.  Trust me.).Aside from that,  this camera has cemented my love of Sony DSLR and DSLR-SLT cameras. My next camera will hopefully be a Sony full-size sensor (the SLT-A99 looks and sounds pretty sweet!), but for now, I'm nowhere near outgrowing the capabilities of an A57.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera for still and video", "Author": "Roderick C.

I love the extremely fast frame rate - 10-12 frames per second. The electronic viewfinder is very good but in using my 120-400mm zoom lens for bird photography, the a-100's optical viewfinder is easier to focus accurately. Like many bird photographers, I use my long lens on manual focus most of the time. Using the a-57, the bird just doesn't \"pop\" into focus like an optical viewfinder does.  The focus peaking feature on the a-57 helps but it still takes longer to focus than my old camera.  With other lenses, though, I don't have any problems.  People buying this (or any other Sony camera) may be interested to know that you can use lenses with other mounts if you have a proper adapter.  I bought an inexpensive M42 lens adapter a few years ago that lets me use old Pentax screw mount lenses on my Sony cameras. The lens must have a \"manual\" switch, otherwise it will stay at maximum aperature.  This manual adapter does not preserve auto focus and you have to set the camera to Aperature Priority or Manual but I am able to use my old Super Takumar 50mm f1.4 lens and an old Soligor 135mm f2.8 lens with  bright, sharp images.

I bought the A57 for its improved resolution (16 instead of 10 MP) and articulating, live-view LCD screen. I was a bit sceptical about the electronic viewfinder, and Sony is taking a risky leap here, eliminating the mechanical complexities of a flip-up, instant-return mirror that has defined SLRs since the late 1950s. So far, Sony is the only manufacturer to make this leap. Only time will tell if this becomes an industry standard.The EVF works fine, and autofocus is very quick. There is essentially no lag in shutter trip. There is a 30% loss in light reaching the sensor, but that's irrelevant with today's high ISOs. There may be a trifle loss in sharpness with the light passing through Sony's translucent mirror, but nothing you can notice. All my old Maxxum lenses work fine, but the newer (since 2009) SAM lenses have focus motors built into the barrel, allegedly delivering smoother and faster focus than the in-body focus motor that focused through a pin on the lens mount. A distinction without a difference, as far as I can tell.The A57 seems to eat batteries faster than the A200, but that is to be expected with the A57's EVF and supersharp live view. The batteries, BTW, are the same, the robust FM500. The A57 uses the standard and cheap SDHC card in contrast to the CompactFlash of the A200. I prefer the off-on switch of the A200 (a carryover from Maxxums) instead of the switch on a ring around the shutter button on the A57, but that will just take some getting used to.The articulating LCD is very desirable, especially for portraits and product shots. You need not get down on your knees for a child's portrait; instead, you use the A57 at waist level, like a Rolleiflex. The A57's LCD, however, is hinged at the bottom, which may interfere with your tripod's head. My solution: get a new tripod with a smaller head to allow the LCD to swing down.The options on the A57 are exceedingly complex and, frankly, I have not mastered them. Without my wanting it, the A57 recently gave me \"continuous\" shooting--like a machine gun--that I'm not sure I've gotten out of. Like learning piano, you have to study and practice daily. Simpler would have been better for most shooters.The A57 may be the last Sony to utilize its special hot shoe that came out with the second generation Maxxums. If you have a flash for that, keep in for the A57. Altho the in-camera A57 flash has been ample for my occasional needs.Be aware that the new A58 gains MPs (20) but loses the supergrade articulating LCD.All-in-all, I am extremely pleased with the A57. It appears that this translucent-mirror technology is the only kind Sony will offer. I think the standard flip-up mirror models have or will be discontinued.

My mom is a big time Nikon fan; my sister-in-law has a Canon.  After spending hours and hours researching and reading reviews, we went to Best Buy to check out the Nikon, see how it handles, etc.  We ended up trying all three brand (Nikon, Sony, and Canon) models at Best Buy.  What made me lean more towards the Sony was the shutter speed.  Because Sony uses the transparent mirror, I can snap up to 16 shots (which doesn't sound like that many until you actually start snapping) of my \"active and always fast moving\" 5 year old son ensuring that at least one shot will be a great one :)My camera traveled with us to Keystone, CO over the New Years holiday when the temps didn't get over 20 degrees while we were there.  I was worried about its durability in the cold (but was willing to try having the warranty).  My Mom, the Nikon fan, was worried about my lens fogging up with the temperature change; she did NOT bring her Nikon for that reason.  The Sony was a champ.  I had NO problems at all.  It took wonderful pictures in all environments - freezing temperatures, in the 70+ mph car, dusk, daylight, full sun, etc.Another perk that was just an extra bonus is the panoramic picture mode.  We visited the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs, and that feature was wonderful to use for taking pictures of the beautiful landscape.The final reason that we decided on the Sony was its compatability with the Minolta lenses.We've had the camera for almost two months now, and I wouldn't trade it for any other brand!  I love it!As a side note, my sister-in-law with the Canon has had it for a year, hardly uses it (only for select special occasions around the house), is having major issues with it turning on, the flash working, the LCD screen, etc.  Not sure which model it is though.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent camera at a great price!", "Author": "Ong Chi Hang", "ReviewID": "R1NE2WR5FKWZN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first camera and after using it for a month, I'm very satisfied with its performance.The main reason I chose this camera is because of its high fps (8,10,12 fps under different mode) combined with a sufficient buffer.

The high fps also allows multi-frame noise reduction and the highest ISO can reach 25600 although I found it quite noisy at that level.

Video quality was great but the sound was fair, which others have suggested an external mic would do better (I will be purchasing).

No exposure bracketing? Fewer white balance settings? No histogram? If I was going to UPGRADE my camera, I demanded that it offer AT LEAST as many features as my old point-and-shoot!Verdict: I love the A57. LOVE. IT.This is my first DSLR, so I can't tell you how it compares to other DSLRs, or how fabulous the kit lens is. You can read others' reviews for that. But I can tell you what stands out to me, as an amateur/ enthusiast/ hobbyist/ first-time-DSLR-user. (I'm the \"photo walk\" type, no studio setups for me.)FIRST:Notes on the 3.5-5.6/ 18-55mm SAM kit lens:(1) You can use 55mm filters with this lens.(2) Because the manual focus ring is the same place you screw in your filters, a screw-on tulip lens hood will not work with this lens. I got a Fotodiox rubber lens hood instead. (Vignettes at 18mm, okay at 19mm. But that's another product review.)(3) The included lens cap does not come with a leash/keeper/lanyard. I, being a spaz, drop my cap a lot, and intend to correct the situation as soon as possible.(4) I can't comment on the optics, but they seem better than those of my point-and-shoot. No complaints.As for the rest of the A57:* A physical comparison of the A57 and the A37:I was 90% sure I was going to buy the A37, until I visited the brick-and-mortar B&H; store in NYC and held an A37 in my hands. The A37 and A57 may have virtually identical software, but the A57 really does feel like it is worth an extra $200: the LCD screen is WAY better; the \"fully-articulated screen\" has already saved my arse far more than I thought it would; the digital level is super, super useful (especially in conjunction with the articulated screen); the larger size and deeper grip are much more comfortable for me (I'm a woman with medium-sized hands: my right handspan is 7.5\", my middle finger is 3\" long).Although final image quality output may be identical, I enjoy photography because I get a kick out of the PROCESS. If I can make the process 10x more fun for myself (and less frustrating because I have 80 bazillion features to get around any photographic dilemma I may encounter)... why not?* I grew up with film cameras; I've taken darkroom photography classes. Guess what? I HATE VIEWFINDERS. Part of the reason I've held off on buying a DSLR is because, for most DSLRs, the LCD-screen Live View doesn't accurately reflect the image your camera will capture, so you HAVE to use the viewfinder. Bleah! Sony's SLT technology allows me to accurately preview my photo on the LCD screen. Awesome.(A lot of photographers find viewfinders good for shooting in bright sun. I don't. Maybe glasses get in the way. I dunno.)* It's good in low light, but not miraculous. This may speak more to the lens than the camera.* I was a little annoyed about having the mode dial on the left shoulder of the camera instead of the right, but I'm getting used to it.* There are multiple ways to set burst mode. If you just set burst on the mode dial (even on the slightly-lower speed/ better crop factor), the image quality seems astoundingly lousy. It works much better if you go into the function menu and set hi-speed shooting as your drive mode. I don't know how the fps speed of this setting compares to the mode dial setting; perhaps another reviewer can comment on this.Overall: the Sony A57 makes me one happy camper.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent DSLT Camera", "Author": "M.

After ~ 10 years with the latter I decided to make an upgrade.  I had every intention of purchasing a Canon, but I wasn't sure which Canon product.  While researching the various online options, I kept seeing the Sonly line of digital cameras getting as good, if not better reviews.  I then had the opportnuity to make a side-by-side compasrison and found that I liked everything about the Sonly equally, if not moreso than the Canon cameras.

I have a variety of Konica Minolta lenses both zooms and primes. I have read up extensively on the A57 before I purchased it and at this point have shot thousands of pictures as well for various events and functions. It is much \"snappier\" and has an overall better feel compared to it's predecessor, it is slightly faster and the UI isn't that different. The AF is quite fast and accurate for the most part, the subject tracking function requires the user to select a target prior to actually tracking, I don't do alot of action shots so this was not an issue.Battery life is awesome, compared to it's predecessor, I don't have to swap batteries out on a typical shoot. I generally take no less than 300 photos each time I shoot. As far as handling, I love that grip better compared to the more compact A55, although it's size is an advantage when hike being smaller and lighter. The overheating problem with video is no longer a problem compared to the A55 but it only shoots 30min at a time (Steadyshot off)My biggest gripe about Sony cameras though is not having the ability to set the ISO limit, I also own 2 Olympus EPL cameras where you can do such a thing. ISO 3200 is just too high for most shots I do, to be able to lower that upper limit to 800 or 1600 would be such a better choice ( I prefer the camera on Auto ISO, though I know I can select ISO manually), and the camera does like to live in that 3200 range when shooting in not so ideal light settings, the software is geared towards minimizing motion blurr versus low noise.( I work with JPEGs more and don't do RAW shot editing unless it's that important of an event). White balance metering has been fixed on the A57 unlike the A55 which varied a little more than I like in the same sequence of shots.FOR SONY - Can you please come up with a firmware update to be able to customize the upper ISO limit!Overall, it's a wonderful SLT, it's loaded with features you can only find in thousand dollar cameras and the availability of legacy Minolta lenses only makes it better. Highly Recommended!Update 01/08/2013I've had the camera a few months and decided to take advantage of the video capabilities, I knew of the noise presence while recording with the built in micrphone so i purchased a ZOOM H2N microphone, along with a flash bar and mounted the mic on it. With the outboard mic (industry-first MS mic!) I must say I was VERY impressed with both the video and Audio quality. This is the most ideal set-up for video, and although the camera itself did not have onboard audio controls, having the H2N was a breeze to integrate with manual recording level controls, compressions/limiting if necessary and a low pass filter... I continue to be amazed by this camera considering the price point!", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Makes great photos easy", "Author": "Toripony \"Cosmic Possum\"", "ReviewID": "R3E6PZU2UNKDRY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This limited review coming from a lifelong amateur.  For the last 10 years I've used a Coolpix 5400; if you know the model you know it was a step up from the \"casual\" Coolpix series.  One feature I loved on it (and still use) was macro shooting at 1.4 inches!  Always had trouble getting enough light for it, though.Not so with the A57!  Great light gathering allows me to succeed at a lot of shots that used to fail.  I'm not a pro; although I understand the concepts of manual 35mm operations (I had two of those previously, too), I tend to rely on the \"auto\" features... the intelligence of the camera.  But I'm never satisfied with \"pocket\" cameras, so I always look for the best thing I can possibly afford.  I never paid $600+ for a camera before but I can almost promise you that you will not be disappointed with this purchase!It's an extremely intelligent camera, pulling detail and color out of the dark and mists that I would certainly miss with a manual or cheap camera.  I can't make comparisons to other models on the market but I can't imagine they would be any better or have more wonderful features.  I could talk all day about the focusing intelligence alone (I almost never touch the manual focus).  The automatic 3-frame combining feature has gotten me several cool bird shots at distances up to 100 yds using a fully extended 450mm zoom... HANDHELD!  This camera's technology is perfect for an amateur like me who wants great photos without learning a lot of photography \"tricks\" or spending 2 minutes adjusting for every shot (although I do that, too, when necessary and sometimes just for fun and practice).The feature I love best is the battery (LOL)... it's an \"intelligent\" rechargable so it can be charged anytime, even if it has a half-charge.  And it can be removed from the charger at any time... even at 1/4-charge.  It won't harm the battery or setup \"short-life\" problems.  AND, compared to any other camera I've used, the battery lasts forever!  I've shot 400+ shots on 2 recharges.  Two small details that concern me... the battery door is just a little bit \"stiff\" to shut; I'm worried it might break someday.  Also the mode dial seems too tight... sometimes hard to turn or \"feel\" if I have it in the notch or between settings.  Haven't had any problems, I just hope it loosens up a tad with more use.  I agree with the previous post/review that mentions the clutter in the viewfinder, although it hasn't annoyed me enough yet to make adjustments to the display settings.I've only had this two months so there are many functions/features still to try, but I've been perfectly pleased with the ones I've tried like the 12-frame panorama feature (captures about 120-140 degrees, I think??)  I also really like the fact that there are controls to disable auto features that might get in the way of a shot.  For example, it automatically switches between LCD display or viewfinder depending on if it detects your eye in the viewfinder.  But if it's not serving you correctly there's a button that lets you manually select which view you want to use.  Overall the button/control layout is good, but I'm still trying to get used to the mode select knob and the Menu button being on the left side.  Once I master it I think I'll like it though; it does give the left hand something to do and unclutters the right-hand side of the camera back/top.The best final comment I can give you is that I am a very picky person who finds fault with most anything, but there's nothing for me to criticize about this camera.  Unless you're a pro I doubt you would regret owning/using this unit and if you're an amateur who justs wants to take better photos without reading books, step up... you will probably love this thing like I do.

I also compared it to other popular SLR cameras.I believe that the quality and sharpness of photographs takenwith this camera are top notch, a result of the large 23 X 15mmCMOS sensor.  Both the LCD and the EVF displays are also topnotch, and live view is very convenient.  Battery life is lessthen some others, but you can still get over 500 photos on afull charge.  The 18-55mm kit lens is great for all around use,but the Tamron 18-200mm lens extends the zoom capabilities. Thisis not the smallest or lightest camera, especially when usedwith the Tamron lens, but it easy to hold and the controls arevery well designed and intuitive.The FN button displays commonly used functions, such as ISO,flash, metering mode, etc.  The Superior Auto mode recognizescommon shooting situations and adjusts accordingly.  Veryrapid for sports or moving objects, shooting at up to 12images per second.  The stabilization works great.  Thereare a variety of flash options.  I personally believe thatthis camera does a great job of automatically selecting AWBand ISO settings, better that other cameras that I have used.Low light capability, without using the flash is alsoimpressive.  I think this is the camera for anyone reallyserious about extremely high quality images.  Note that thereare also two panoramic modes, and a bunch of creative shootingmodes.Anyone moving up from even high end P&S; cameras should bepleased and impressed at the improved low light capabilities,the high speed and the extremely high image quality.It does take some effort to understand all of the featuresand options of this camera, but I think it is well worth theeffort.  I found a wealth of information in David Busch's A57guide, and believe that it is well worth the investment.The only down side I can think of is that this fairly largeand heavy and will not fit into your pocket.

It does a better job than Canon and Nikon in night video shooting (based on YouTube videos). The auto focus is ridiculously accurate. Enough with the pluses though.The downside is that the panoramas aren't easy to shoot at all. The camera usually skips the ending of the frame and fills it with empty black space. This never happened using my Fuji HS20. The macro shots are very good, but only when it lets you click the shot. I am usually stuck pushing the click button and nothing happens. I really don't understand what the issue is. The menu is confusing with some modes not available for editing in certain dials. There is a conflict between 2 modes, namely, P & Auto Scene. This makes for a problematic on-the-fly experience.

Almost no delay from when you hit the button to the picture being taken.  The kit lens takes clear and sharp pictures.  I'm not as impressed with my older Minolta lenses so far on this camera...but I think I need to spend some time with the camera first....the file size with the Minolta lenses (70-210 and 35-70)are half of the size with the kit lens.  I'm willing to call it user error/ignorance at this point.The video is the best home movie quality I've seen.  We took it to the pool and the water and waves look incredible.My only complaint so far is the lack of a rear lens cover. I spent eight hundred bucks and I have to go to Wal Mart and spend $3.32 for a rear lens cover.  The 'packaging lid'  supplied is of 'dixie cup' quality.

Rossi", "ReviewID": "RAQKHUY1BXSPD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Sony A57 from Amazon it arrived without any problems, it could have been packed a little better, the camera box was packed loose in a larger box with no padding and was free to move around freely in the larger box. I have taken a couple hundred test shots using all the functions and this is my report:This camera has a nice weight and feel and very fast and is fun to use. The 18-135mm kit lens is really nice and pretty sharp but very soft around the edges, the colors this camera takes are beautiful and true to life, but I'm getting grain (color noise) in the shadow areas even at ISO 100 and it really shows much worst at ISO 400 and above in bright light outdoor photos. At ISO 1600 and above with available light photos indoors the whites really show color noise pretty bad. The software that comes with the camera is horrible in my opinion and the instruction manual is a joke! I encountered a large dust spot on my sensor in the upper right hand corner. Fortunately, I was able to remove it using a Giotto blower. I put my lens on the camera when I received it and never removed it, this spot came from the factory! In conclusion the images are sharp and colorful, and there are tons of special features. Since this camera is very inexpensive you really get a lot for your money. I also want to mention that I'm not a new comer to photography or DSLRs. I was a wedding and portrait photographer for over 25 years and my travel photos are all over the web and are very well acclaimed. Not a bad camera but not outstanding either, it is however a good buy!", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "WAIT! I'm not sure how it can get better but, the NEW Sony is coming out!

To summarize my experience with the A57 I'd say it is a well put-together feature set of Sony's best since the introduction of the A55 in 2010. This makes it a proven performer for anyone stepping up to a DSLR from a compact camera, and one that concedes little in terms of either value or performance to its competitors from Canon, Nikon and Pentax.  A touch-sensitive screen and a more sensibly angled LCD would be worthy additions but the A57 is an excellent camera in it's price range.That being said, Sony has announced it's successor, the A58.

First, coming from Canon DSLR with multiple lenses, 17-85mm, 24-105mm, 50mm F1.8, 85mm F1.8, 70-200mm F4. I was totally sold on Sony system when I purchased NEX-5N with 18-55mm kit lens last November. The image quality produced by the camera surpassed all my Canon set up, especially at 18-45mm range. At 55mm, the lense is some what soft. Later I bought a Sigma 30mm lens, which is a super sharp lens.Since Nex-5N does not come with viewfinder, I found myself miss it very much. Since I don't like the imge quality of Nex-7 as much as Nex-5N(softer at 24M), and it also costs $600 more, it is ruled out early. In the meantime Sony is also coming out with Nex-6 soon, with 16M and viewfinder. Not sure its selling price at release time, but adding a walk around lens with more reach than 18-55mm leaves no choice but Sony or Tamron 18-200mm, it alone costs about $800.Luckly saw Sony A57 and 18-135mm combo on Amazon, at price that is just little more than a nex lens alone. Ordered it and tested it. The result is that image quality with 18-135mm even surpasses NEX-5N at 18-55mm, sharp, contrast and artifact free. The image quality at 30mm is very close to Sigma 30mm.

Sony is setting hte standard high in this realm. However, the camera picture taking performance seems way immature to me.  BTW, nothing in its class can touch this thing for movies, nothing.  However, hving said that, its a dslr and pics ought to be worth way more than movies. Thus, below is just a few of the bigger nits i've picked after playing with this system for 1.5 months and comparing to nikon 5100, nikon 600, canon t3i and t4i, pentax k30.The jpeg engine is a joke relative to its peers, even relative to cheap P&S; cams in my estimation and there hv been a ton of complaints on the web from both pros and amateurs on this aspect but sony appears to do little to address it, if its done anything at all.  This is really inexcusable---there are so many good jpeg algorithms out there, sony should license one if its too hard for them to write their own!Noise abatement is overly agressive.  Again, fairly many comments on the web to this point.The metering system is amateurish compared to more mature rivals. Anything beyond the most basic scenes raises metering concerns with the Sony.  For example, it often overexposes and clips sky details or other bright detail in other hi contrast scenes. Should be way better at metering these relatively common but tough exposures and at least not clipping anywhere near as much as it does. My god, the histogram shows the clipping, sony can use that to back down the exposure a bit, and kick up their auto DRO if they want the darker detail (much like nikon does with its active d-lighting approach i guess, how hard is this?)  I certainly can (and did) compensate for this in any of the non-auto modes but why should i have to?  the cam has the information it needs to do it itself.  Immature system really.The auto and auto+ modes are completely worthless in my 1.5 months of experience with this cam. From my experience, in auto (or auto+), the a57 rarely identifies the proper scene, rarely meters correctly except for really simple scenes or outdoor scenes with consistent lighting across the scene (not high contrast as mentioned above), rarely gets the iso right on indoor shots (in room lighting, it often chooses a really hi iso which will result in terrible noise, rather than pop the flash or lower the shutter speed. If it does pop the flash, it throws a LOT of light, way more than necessary or wanted), and rarely uses the flash with proper exposure (almost exclusively is too hot---not overexposed, just no background subtleties retained. Their flash metering montra seems to be, \"make it bright to capture the subject, and lets not worry about the overall scene or background!\"  I rather think INTELLIGENT auto should be smarter than that---again, immature system). Some affecionados may gripe that anybody uses the auto mode at all. Tough----sony offers it, i paid for it, i use it often enough, and i EXPECT it to work far better than it does. Its really poor in this regard (and i've compared to nikon, canon, pentax systems and my comments are based on comparing to the competition, and are not personal based on my emotions).In general, and in all modes, flash often tends to be too bright in nearly every use, even in program or A or S or whatever---at least in these modes, its compensation can be backed off to acceptable levels, but really no reason they can't get this right out of the box and no reason i should have to back this off to MINIMUM flash in ALL situations.Oh, too, as a point of interest, i also purchased TWO OTHER a57 systems just to compare to the one i'm writing up to make sure i didn't have a lemon, they all worked very much the same---identically really.  These are design issues and not one-off faults.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this cam line is sony's poor support in correcting these problems/issues/design flaws---there's a ton of commentary on the web along the lines i've mentioned here,and sony doesnt appear to be very responsive to the criticism or suggestions, continuing to push these, shall we say, immaturities on a loyal buying public. They better wake up and deal with this stuff or they will find themselves losing market share as fast as they've gained it. Their features wont carry the day forever, afterall, its a camera and will ultimately be judged on its picture quality and performance relative to its peers. Overall, the features are great, as i've said, and i struggled for a long time trying to accept the sub-par camera performance/operation just to retain the feature set. However, cam performance and operation is only 90% of what it should be in my opinion and in the end, i use it FOR its camera aspects!  Dont get me wrong, the image quality is on par with its peers, its just there is too many things about how its takes pics that it could do better.  Metering, flash, jpeg rendering, noise reduction (and these are just the big ones)---they are deal breakers for me. sry, just how it comes down for me given the 8000 picts i've taken. Really can't recommend it for these reasons, and I've returned it.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "buy it now", "Author": "ceejay", "ReviewID": "R72TGTMJMFTZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "if your into film buy this camera. 3 days with it and going nuts!!! will be posting videos soon if u would like to see please visit:[...]", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Won't shoot ghosts", "Author": "My Fake Name", "ReviewID": "RA39REACUYIHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*****The Sony A57 is a DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) with interchangeable lenses and a maximum density of 16.1 megapixels.  It records and plays back video, and this package comes with an 18-55 millimeter zoom lens.  You can focus manually, and it includes auto-focus in still photography, of course, but also in video and even video during zoom.The A57 (where the \"A\" really means the lower-case Greek letter alpha) is a sophisticated camera suitable for many professional uses and most amateur use.  (A step up from the A57 is the A65, which boasts 24 megapixels, which is 50% more and which is suitable for most professional use and all amateur use.)As you'll see, I end up awarding 5 stars to the  Sony Alpha SLT-A57K 16.1 MP Exmor APS HD CMOS Sensor DSLR with Translucent Mirror Technology, 3D Sweep Panorama and 18-55mm Zoom Lens.Pluses-- In continuous exposure mode the A57 can rip off as many as 12 frames a second, which is really fast and which might help you improve your golf swing or your bowling delivery or your take-off as you're training for the Olympics in the standing high jump.  Each individual image is remarkably crisp, even if you have to move the camera a little to capture all the action.-- The still capture of low-light, no-flash scenes is remarkably good.  From all my other cameras I'd gotten used to blurry darkness, but the A57 shines in this problematic province.  (Shines, get it?)-- With my Nikon D5100 in video, when you zoom the movement of the motor or the lens elements or both is audible on playback as a clicking.  The same is not true of the Sony A57.  For this I add 1/2 a star, which makes it 5-1/2 stars so far.Minuses-- You cannot use the A57 to photograph aliens or ghosts.  I can't prove this, so you'll just have to take my word for it.  I do promise that my house is veritably inFESTed with aliens and ghosts, but this camera -- as with all the others I've tried, and over the years that's been a lot -- refuses to record them.  As you probably know, one of the characteristics of such entities is that they cannot be photographed, so the fact this camera cannot take their photographs or any video of them pretty much proves they're there, for which I thank the Sony Corporation so sincerely for being on my side.-- The A57 does not have a time-lapse feature, which I would have expected in a camera this costly.  Since much cheaper cameras offer this feature, I suspect this is an oversight and not the result of some software impossibility.  Because I happen to have found this feature useful in the past and expect to do so in the future, I subtract back that half a star.-- If you aim from ten yards away with a Marlin .22 rifle at the center of the optical from dead on, and if you hit it as you know I did if you've read some of the previous reviews about how accurate I am at shooting various products from ten yards away, the camera is instantly rendered useless.  At that point when you turn it on it always emits a little puff of smoke and then otherwsie completely 100% stops responding to your commands no matter what you do except that now when you shake it things move around a lot and some of them fall off.  I subtract no stars for this, I'm just letting you know the results of my tests.  Also, I have learned that this sort of testing is not, not surprisingly, covered by the warranty.*****Although I normally think of Canon and Nikon first when it comes to DSLRs, I will now add Sony to that list.*****", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good but not great", "Author": "Mary Ann Machi", "ReviewID": "R12NF0WYKS7U6W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I can't give a technical review as many of you do.

I was hoping that with the increased burst capabilities, I would be able to better capture those quick moments when taking pics of my grand daughter.What I've found appears to be less than optimal.  In a full weekend of testing both at an indoor graduation and at an after party, again indoors, I am finding the indoor pictures to be extremely noisy.At the graduation, when I took pictures using the flash within the two or three rows right around me, I found the flash to be great and didn't overexpose the pictures.  That appears to be the only plus.  When taking pictures at 55mm of the graduation floor with the students, I tried several modes: Intelligent Auto+, and two scene selections: speed burst and the nighttime scene where it captures 6 quick images together.  In all situations, the pictures were ISO 1200 or more, and every single picture was noisy and it was impossible to even consider trying to crop the picture at all.  I also tried video at 24FPS and the quality was terrible.So, I figured it was just a bad situation where I really could have used a good optical zoom lens in the first place.  So, we went back home and I took indoor pics in our family room with reasonable light.  This time, I left it in the intelligent Plus and Intelligent Plus+ modes.  Again, every picture came in at around 3200 ISO.  It's not like the camera even attempted to take use a lower ISO and bump the shutter or aperture.  The results were horrendous.  Every picture was noisy and grainy.  Full 16MP pictures that clocked in around 6MB file sizes taken 4-6 feet from the subject were noticeably grainy and had zero detail.Granted, I know that I should spend more time with the camera and use the Program modes more than relying on the Auto modes, but for $800, The intelligent Auto settings are not very intelligent at all if it's going to constantly force 3200+ ISO indoor pictures.  About the only thing positive about any of the pictures taken thus far is that they are in focus!  At least with the fast frames per second and quick autofocus, all my pictures are in focus.  Unfortunately, they are all too noisy to even consider keeping.Unless I'm doing something terribly wrong, I don't see the a57 as being a keeper.
