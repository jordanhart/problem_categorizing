{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Leica D-Lux 5", "Author": "WVU Mountaineer", "ReviewID": "R21IOTXJGP7S3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tired of carrying my DSLR and associated lenses, etc and decided to go to a Point and Shoot (P&S;) camera. I had read a great deal and having owned a Nikon D-60 DSLR for a period of time, was concerned primarily with picture quality in going from a DSLR with large sensor to a P&S; with much smaller sensor. For 3 solid months, give or take, I diligently, researched all P&S; cameras as well as \"mirrorless cameras\" currently on the market. I went to 'handle' the cameras I was interested in (see below) and to Flickr on the internet and queried some groups regarding the cameras I was considering. I am a hobbyist when it comes to photography but, I was obsessed with getting as close to the superior photo quality of a DSLR as possible in a P&S.; I finally decided on the Leica due to (what I believe to be) superior photo quality and excellent in-camera jpeg processing. I looked at the Nikon P7000...mixed but generally lower reviews within this group (I have owned a number of/and greatly respect Nikons); Panasonic LX5...which many say to be the same as the Leica (with the exception of jpeg processing); Canon G-12...which seemed ok with the exception of handling RAW production and the Canon S95...not as good in the lens department and photo processing. Both the Leica and Panasonic have a larger sensor than the rest of this group. Granted, I could have purchased any of these really good cameras, at a much lower price; but, I found the color and overall photo quality of the D Lux 5 to be best of the group I researched. I have never owned a Leica before and I while I expected it I am still shocked at the sticker price and cost of accessories. I'll not debate the pros and cons of the Panasonic LX5 versus the Leica, there is enough information in that regard published by professionals and labs, all over the internet. The warranty and the inclusion of Lightroom 3 were nice additions, to help soothe the price pain. A word about the warranty, depending on what you read the warranty goes anywhere from 2 years (what was in my box warranty) and some (see Steve Huff's excellent analysis) say 3 years. I'll admit the whole warranty process was/is confusing. I bought my camera from B&H; Photo in New York and was confused when the salesman said that there was no warranty with the Leica during checkout and that I should buy an additional warranty for 2 years. Everything I had read previous to my purchase, said Leica provided a 2 year warranty and so I passed on the B&H; offer, hope I am right. I am very happy with this camera. It is easy to operate, provides excellent stabilization, in-camera menus are outstanding, shoots in RAW format and is easy to carry/handle. Leica accessories are expensive though. Many of the items that fit the LX5; also, fit the Leica. The viewfinder, although with mixed reviews, is a must if you shoot in bright daylight or snowy environs. The Panasonic viewfinder is around $200.00 less than the Leica brand and supposedly fits/works the same on the D Lux 5...we'll see. My decision to buy the Leica boiled down to quality of build/pictures and reputation. Good sites to go to: stevehuffphoto.com; DPReview; CNET; bhphotovideo.com; snapshot.com; youtube and if you want to look at actual photos, taken by everyday users of the Leica D Lux 5, see the Leica groups on Flicr.

I was going back and forth between this and the Panasonic LX5 as they are essentially the same camera as I've read. I wanted something for travel and as a backup to my Canon dSLR. This is smaller than I expected which is actually great because I can fit it in my pocket!As for price, if you think about it, the copy of Adobe Lightroom and the 3 year warranty basically means it costs about the \"same\" as the LX5 if not getting a better deal IMO.  Yeah, I like the red dot too...and the build is really solid for this camera..and a beautiful one at that. The menu is pretty intuitive. The manual isn't all that informative.Picture quality looks great, I like the different formats..I can take square pics or wide angle..The special effects aren't as robust as the Olympus Pen, but I use graphic editing programs anyway....gets a little noisy above 1600  but again, I have noise reduction software..but for its size and convenience and the fast 2.0  lens, available light photography is great. I use this mainly as my street photography/photojournalism cam.I would've given it 5 stars if it had a viewfinder...I really wish these companies producing these compact cameras, 4/3 cameras and the like would have a built in viewfinder..it only makes sense. Also, don't get the Dlux4 battery for this, it won't fit. I have to wait about a month before they release the ones for Dlux5 and exchange the Dlux4 battery.But I'm happy so far and hopefully I'll be able to update to the M series someday.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Leica but lacking much...", "Author": "J. Moro \"JM\"", "ReviewID": "R2I1X5HKXXZJ34", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a few weeks ago to try it out after hearing much about it.  Quite frankly I'm not sure what the hoopla is all about -- other than it has a red dot on it.  First of all I AM a photogapher.  I shoot with a Nikon D700, d300, a bevy of Nikon glass, as well as medium format Mamiya film and digital.  So yes, I do know what I'm talking about and this is not a casual review.The Leica is an incredible piece of metal.  I love the heft, and the feel of it.  The lens is superb at F2.0.  Love it.  I LOVED the 1:1 ratio which gave me square images -- one of the reasons I still shoot 2/14 film on occasion.  The video option was also awesome. I shot several movies in B&W; which was so neat and also in the 1:1 ratio  I loved it.  They were crystal clear in HD.My problem, and this could only be my problem, not yours was the image quality.  I shot a total of 263 images with the little gem and was extremely disappointed in the image quality. I shot mostly at ISO 80 which is the lowest;  I also chose an aperture between the F2, and F4.5 or 5.6 depending on the light.  I used a tripod for many of the shots but I just couldn't get over the smudging of the noise reduction.  Oh, I shot in both jpeg and raw format, which is how I shoot my D700, and D300 100% of the time.Anyway I shot and I shot away.  I had several designers I work with look at prints I made (11 x 14) and at 13 x 19 and they noticed the noise and/or the smudging.  Since I shoot for stock, working with several on line sites, as well as \"real\" agencies I submitted a batch of images to them all.  Each and every image was rejected from three online sites, and my agents due to \"overall lack of focus and detail due to excessive noise reduction\"  (which smudged the images).  Even when viewing them on screen in Lightroom at 100% they were awful.  I did submit the out of camera jpegs, as well as jpegs that I processed from the raw files in LR3.  Neither was accepted by anyone.  Since that is pretty much my bread and butter I decided to return the camera.  At $799.00 it's way overpriced (IMHO) as a piece of equipment that I can carry wherever for \"the shot\" when I don't have my dSLR's with me.  I believe the Panasonc Lumix, which is essentially the same camera without the red dot, is $300.00 less.  Even at the Panasonic's $399 or $499 price point it's still way overpriced due to the lack of resolution/sharpness even at the lowest ISO of 80.  I don't get it.  I played with every option in the menu's trying to get it to shoot correctly; shot the highest quality jpegs, and simultaneous raw file to no avail.  At this point I'm 99.9% certain it wasn't me causing this.If I were an amateur, and just wanted to capture atypical \"I was here\" shots, and videos I might be tempted. It is a gorgeous camera. But my being so nit picky about noise, grain, and image quality I just could not bring myself to keep this camera.On a side note Amazon and J&R; Music World were fabulous to deal with. Shipping was fast, return processing was fast as well and I was given my full credit as of last night.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent and versatile point and shoot camera with an unsurpassed lens- at a price!", "Author": "J. M. Fitzpatrick \"John Fitzpatrick\"", "ReviewID": "R1OUUC9QXWZNYC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Leica is an excellent point and shoot camera.It is expensive, and hence it is not for everyone!However, it offers a very fine quality and versatile zoom lens, which I believe is unsurpassed amongst current point and shoot cameras.The bright f2- 3.3 lens, with a 24mm (equivalent)wide angle is ideal for travel photographs in a broad range of situations.From my perspective, there are four critical characteristics of the lens which are of great value:1. The brightness of the lens,which is much superior to other p&s; cameras, at each end of the zoom range. By the way, the digital zoom reaches to 15x;2. The lack of distortion at wide angle focal lengths- this is a particularly good feature;3. The very wide 24mm wide angle- very helpful for a travel camera; and4. The very high quality of the lens- it is noticeable!The quality of the lens, and the ability to capture pictures in a broad range of situations was a critical consideration for me in deciding to buy the Leica. With previous point and shoot cameras (most recently a Canon SD950IS), I have found the most limiting factor for travel photography has been the limitations imposed by the optics. The Leica broadens the picture taking capability significantly, but you do need to take into account that the better lens does make it a slightly larger camera. I am happy to accept this in return for the enhanced versatility afforded by the higher quality optics.Other features I liked are:1. The flash- much better than the Canon (which had a tendency to allow red eye, even in \"minimization\" mode); and2. The ability to easily select from a broad range of aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 2:1 and 1:1) using a switch on the side of the lens.The quality of construction of the camera is impressive- it feels good to use, with precise controls.The cost may seem to be high. But, if you take a large number of pictures, I suggest you take into account the \"per picture\" cost as well as the value of getting good pics!! I took 14,000 pictures with my Canon over the last 3 years. By the end of that time, I suspect it was wearing out! I suspect I will take just as many with the Leica!If you appreciate a nice compact camera which takes good pictures, I believe you are unlikely to be disappointed with the Leica.By the way, to get an idea of the camera's capabilities, take a look at the sample pics I have uploaded and included in the product page.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Camera Ever!", "Author": "Dr. Bitz \"Boss Angeles\"", "ReviewID": "R3PT601PKPJ7LA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own several Sony products, including the Alpha 350 DSLR and the DSC-WX1. My workflow is mostly architectural documentation and the occasional art shot. But what I do shoot has to be presentation quality. I got sick of blown out images and flat looking pictures that just didn't look that good. I think the metering was lousy. I spent my time retouching everything. After reading countless reviews I ponied up for this D Lux-5. Woah. The quality of the image is crystal clear, rich and beautiful, all on the snapshot mode using RAW. Controls and menus are average to easy to use, build quality very good. I like the HD video quality too, although I have to run it through the Handbrake converter for Mac Mp4 files. Such a difference and worth the money for sure. If you want to take stunning DSLR quality snapshots on the go, then this camera is for you. The wide angle lens is a stunner as well, especially in the video mode.

Nery", "ReviewID": "RAH2IE8LZXWAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a photographer and I don't intend to be - though, by all means, I admire the profession. It's just that it's not something I can place priority in the next few years at least, mostly because the learning curve is steep if you intend to be good or great (who needs another mediocre photographer?)Having said that, I'll tell you why I bought a Leica: so that I could have the best camera possible without having to learn how to use it. I want the cam solely to accompany me on trips around the world. I love landscapes, monuments, streets. And it's simply a waste to see so much beauty in the world and be unable to capture it with some dignity. So I figured that, unable to commit myself to really learn how to do it, I could at least buy a great cam that would make the best decisions for me.I did buy Alexander White's guide, so that I could at least learn about the potential of my Leica. So I think now I know what AP, S and MF mean. Not that I can do anything meaningful with that knowledge... Still, I did try to use what I learned here and there, when I had time to tweak a little in my first trip with it. Hmmm. WHY? Everytime I tried the results went from disastrous to acceptable. I tried to use it in P as much as possible so as to get RAW files, as I meant to learn how to deal with those. But then... well, when I put it on A the results were so amazing (though this mean no RAW) that I simply gave up to outsmart it. If in A I get a photo I love, why bother with tweaking it even more???In the last trip I took I had many friends with huge Nikons and Canons, two were pros... and even though they had better zooms, at least in those particular travel pictures I can assure you - my Leica on A was just as good as their DSLRs most of the time. And, I swear, sometimes even better. Amazing colors! The main difference is that they were carrying more weight and a more expensive equipment than me. But for that purpose, travel pics, let me tell you... they brought their tuxedos to the beach party. So I really couldn't be happier with my camera. I have another trip coming up and I still won't know how to get anything useful out of P... but I'll use it in A and I'll have ridiculously beautiful pics, and that's exactly how I want it.Just a word of caution: buy an extra battery. After having taken about 150 pics with RAW my battery died. That was noon in Jerusalem! I find that 150 (jpeg+RAW, little flash) is the average for a full charge. Maybe .jpgs only would conserve more energy? I don't know. Still, if you intend to travel, buy extra batteries.So those who know little or nothing of photography... get this Leica, because it's wonderful for people like you and me: dummies who appreciate QUALITY!", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Opinions on the D-LUX 5", "Author": "Michael M. Shaw", "ReviewID": "R2EBR29OU5CQHG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many folks on the Panasonic and Leica internet fora have discussed the prices of the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX5 and the Leica D-LUX 5. The discussion usually centers on noting that the two cameras are essentially identical. No question about it; both cameras share the same electronics and lens. So why buy the Leica?First, you're getting a longer warranty--two years for the D-LUX 5.Second, the Leica camera comes with a registration code for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3, an excellent post-processing, DAM and workflow program that alone has sold for $299 at the highest price (though recently on sale for a substantial reduction). The LUMIX comes with SilkyPix Developer Studio SE, a program that I find to be a little difficult to warm up to, though it does a credible job.Third, and this is the best part for me: The D-LUX 5 is a Leica. It has a shape and build and finish that to me are elegant, minimalist and simply beautiful...more so than the Panasonic version. I own the LX5W and the LUMIX is a beautiful camera in white. But the D-LUX 5--a gift I bought for my wife--strikes me as being the better overall bargain and just a superb piece of craftsmanship. And yes, I do like the \"red dot\".Some will note that the Panasonic LUMIX has a grip for your right hand and the Leica does not. A very high quality third-party grip is available for the Leica (Google Richard Franiec) at a very modest price and I highly recommend it.In the end, what appears to be an unjustified higher price seems to me to be a well-justified expense.

It takes wonderful depth shots as a default -- just beautiful separation of different lighting situations in the same room or space, and the 16:9 option makes you feel like you're in the room when you look at the photo. I love the feel of it, and the precision and simplicity in the design. I bought it and then after playing with it and reading Steve Huff's review ([...]) and reading Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX5 (apparently the same camera in terms of functionality), and then playing with it some more, I decided to keep it. I look forward to learning more about the camera and how to achieve different things with it. Also, I am impressed by the video -- it's a nice quality, if you don't count the remnants of light that hover in lines above candles now and then.

In the past months however, the camera has won me over to the extent that I now call it my number one. I carry it on my belt, and it goes with me everywhere I go. I initially bought it for exactly that reason. I was working with my tractor in the woods and the whole time an ermine followed me around, curious, and me with no camera.Now I can draw the camera in a flash and snap a photo whenever I see a good opportunity. I can't even quess how many more photos I shoot with this than I shot with my 40d, and more photos mean more excellent photos. I've surprised moose, antelope, deer, big horn sheep, eagles, hawks, herons, and more, but never saw the ermine again.What I like:Size, quality of image, quality of video, raw file capability, quality of view screen, did I say size?What I don't like:No reasonable filter option. I think this is really bad design. You can get an after market tube that looks for all the world like a sewer pipe with a window, but that defeats the point of having a small camera. Someday I will damage my lens -- $800 down the drain. Apart from this, I would give 5 stars.In closing, my photography has changed a lot with this camera. In the past, I always took photography too seriously. If it wasn't a great shot, I didn't take it. . . . and when I was with others, I participated but never documented. That has changed.

Each camera was slightly different from the other.  The disparities were two and this is when both cameras were set to factory settings.  The LCD display was brighter on one camera and the flash was also more powerful on this camera (camera 1).  The flash output can be adjusted and the LCD display has three settings, but camera 1's LCD display is brighter no matter what the setting. When the flash is set to zero on both cameras the output difference is significant. Batteries were swapped between cameras but the results remained the same.The red color issue is common to both cameras and cannot be corrected using either the auto white balance or manually setting the white balence to the correct Kelvin setting for the lighting condition.  The red color is not correct even if a white sheet of paper is used to set the K1 or K2 white balance.  I also changed the auto white balance manually and moved it to the more green setting.  This improves the red imbalance slightly but also overstates the green so no winner here.I photographed a ceramic sugar bowl I made years ago when my wife and I took our kids out for a arts play day (yes, my sugar bowl is really bad so I emblazed the word Help! on the lid). The predominant colors are yellow, green and rusty red.  The D lux 5 sees if differently with a brighter chartruse red that over powers the yellows and turns some of them to red.  The sad thing here is my Samsung Rugby II phone gets the picture color right.For a $800.00 camera this is simply not acceptable.  I don't want a camera that adds more brightness or color than I actually see.  I can understand if this was just one camera with a problem, but for two cameras to have the same problems and to also not match each other in flash settings or display brightness??  To bad, I really wanted the D Lux 5 to shine.  No recommendation here, just disappointment. I'm considering sending my new camera to Leica assuming they won't send me a refurb.  I'll update my review if this happens.I also don't understand all the rave reviews here. I cannot give a rave review to a camera no matter what cost I try justify. If it can't get the color right then it's not worth even $200.00 to me. Buyers...try testing the accuracy of the red colors. Two out of two cameras having the same problem is not a coincidence. Just to add....I am not a novice regarding photography. I have been taking photo's since I was 18 and always enjoyed quality photography gear going back to my Navy days with a Yashica SLR.  I've owned professional Nikons, Canons, Contax G2 and many more over the past 46 years. My color perception is perfect and has been tested by the US Navy and NASA.Follow up January 2012: I decided to send the D Lux 5 to Leica USA for a check-up. I really did not expect that they would find anything wrong with this camera as I had two samples of the D Lux 5 that shared the same problems, color and white balance. When I received the camera back from Leica I let it collect dust for weeks as I was busy shooting with another camera I recently purchased. There were a few items I needed to shoot in the macro mode so I unwrapped the \"repaired\" D lux 5 and set the camera up with my preferred settings using the auto white balance and then took a few macro shots. I was surprised at the quality of the photo's. The color was absolutely spot on and the subject was perfectly focused.  After trying many different modes I'm really pleased with this camera. Turns out you can get two bad eggs in a row.

The camera has a fairly typical and complete array of functions that is taking some time to learn. They are nicely arrayed and access through menu is friendly. Includes the RAW file format, but it's a .rwl which isn't that recognizable. Video functions are immediately accessible. The accompanying software download Abode Lightroom is not easy (it converts your .rwl to .dng or .tiff) and like the Adobe we come to know, required significant downloads within the first month, including a total replacement! A few complaints that are not deal killers: Battery life is lower than expected, compared to typical Nikon or Canon. Holding the camera steady is something of a learning curve, though to help there is an eye-viewer add-on that itself costs, like the Leica we've always known, more than just about any compact digital camera on the market. It is very recognizable as many passers by seemed to recognize the camera, even from a distance, and though this isn't a complaint it may be a warning if you don't like to attract attention.

I carry this camera in my purse at all times. Took it to Hawaii (left the D700 at home) and just love the shots. The camera is so easy to use, and even the JPGs clean up nicely in Lightroom.

Get paid occasionally, but It is at the very least a full-time hobby. And I also am finishing a B.A. in Photography. I bought this specifically as a \"toss in the glovebox\" camera to always have with me when I was not around any of my camera gear, and to take location scouting for various projects. Overall it is an excellent camera, with surprisingly easy controls (I'm not a gear nut so this is the only \"enthusiast compact\" i've ever had, but from what I can tell it is pretty awesome).I paid just over $500 on eBay for it. The $799 price tag is pretty steep for any camera of this type, and since all the other reviews say that the Panasonic camera this is a rebrand of has the same image quality/controls, then I'd just buy that, unless you can find a detail on the Leica version. Having the Leica version is nice because it inspires more confidence when I meet with someone who is paying me money to take pictures and sees me whip out a point 'n' shoot at a location.... more so than the generic looking, generic named panasonic. I also found a non-leica leather case on eBay that is an absolute MUST for this camera. Felt lined, two-piece, it looks incredible for about $50 shipped.The photo quality is impressive, especially from RAW (I have never seen a reason to shoot jpeg out of any camera... why cheat yourself out of editing headroom). I've done some serious  \"damn it i framed way too wide\" cropping, I mean like taken the middle third or quarter of the image, and the images are still sharp enough to use at least in web page form, large file size. Don't get too hung up on megapixels. 12 is more than enough for most things. I print up to 24-36\" on the long side, and I've made 12mp look great even at poster size. So don't talk yourself into spending an extra grand on a camera with 16-18-20+ megapixels just because you get buyer's fever. My 18mp Canon EOS 7D makes moderately sharper prints at those massive sizes, but I have printed an image from my D-Lux 5 almost that size, and I doubt anyone but me could tell they were from different cameras, and then only because they were deep focus landscapes where everything was in focus. It really doesn't matter what resolution your photo is if it has thin DOF and most of the photo is blurry anyway.The little aperture/shutter speed adjust dial by your thumb is small, but works great considering it is almost invisible. in Aperture Priority just rotate the dial to adjust aperture just like an SLR (ditto with shutter speed in S-mode). Press the little dial in (like a button), and you have quick access to exposure comp. ISO and white balance functions are quick access.The rear LCD looks pretty good, but these days all of them look pretty good. Not worth mentioning more.Focusing is about as fast as any newer point-n-shoot, which is about average I guess. It is disappointing if you are used to DSLR optical autofocus. Contrast detect AF just plain sucks, and even when camera manufacturers try to improve on it, they can only make is suck slightly less. That's just the rule of the game at today's current tech level. The F/2 lens gives pretty good moderately shallow DOF considering the size of the sensor, with decent bokeh. Some of the best you will see without seeking gear that is designed for good bokeh and short DOF (I.e. full frame sensor camera, LEICA R glass, etc)Besides the high retail price, the SINGLE issue i have with this camera, is that if I turn it on with the lens cap on, It just keeps asking to remove the cap. It doesn't look like you can just go into playback mode to quick browse through the images. You have to take the cap off, which I think is a waste of time. Why not have a simple menu item to change this, because I can't be the only one who turns their camera on to look at the pictures frequently (or to show an image to someone else). It is a pet peeve, but I judge my gear pretty harshly if it interrupts the pace I work at (especially if i pay over $500 for a damn tiny camera only to have it bug me to remove the lens cap when I don't even want to take a picture)So I gave it FOUR out of FIVE stars for a combination of the high price, and for the lens cap annoyance. Other than that, i LOVE this camera. I find myself always taking it out of the case and handling it when i'm at rest and I have the camera with me.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera and gives you more than you would ever expect from a compact sized camera!", "Author": "Victor", "ReviewID": "R33H5N4T9EZ65S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about 2 months ago... and i'm just lovin it more with time. Great Leica lens with unmatched picture quality from any of it's close competitors (even to quite similar one's like the Panny LX5). The D-Lux 5 comes packed with Manual controls and plenty of pre-configured shooting modes (portraits, babies, landscapes day/night...). I read it somewhere in the reviews that the menu configuration is some how cheap and not up to the level- which I certainly don't agree with for two reasons: 1- it's simple and intuitive and you get used to it in few days of operation. 2- I see it more as a German type oriented software with no complication in design; after all the Leica appears vintage and the menu style should complement the looks. Size and weight are important features of the D-lux 5 to consider, if you're willing to carry it with you on travels.I am not a professional photographer, but I did compare it with my friend's Panny LX5 and to Canon's 550D dSLR. I tried shooting starry sky mode (moon and stars) which I consider challenging because of \"low light\" situation and the picture exposure and saturation was superior to the shots taken by the other 2 cams. Now, I am quite positive that the Leica lens with the internal processor are far superior together than most, if not any other similar product. And yes it's a bit more pricey but if you can afford it you should get it!On another note,the major downside (in my personal opinion)is that Leica didn't release much gears and accessories for the product although its Panasonic sibling has (i.e. wide angle/macro lenses). These lenses can only maximize the utility and enjoyment of the D-Lux 5. However, you can use the Panny lenses as they fit both cams.I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-end product characterized with superior picture quality and portability!", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "An excellent compact camera", "Author": "TL", "ReviewID": "R27IH0JHPI7QQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a compact camera for everyday use as my DSLR and the equipments are quite heavy to carry around, so I did some research and tested various compact cameras and 4/3 systems cameras, and decided to get this leica camera as it has the best combination of size, build quality, picture quality, and zoom range.This camera is small and light, but yet it feels solid, and has good ergonomics.

Absolutely love this camera.  Pictures are better than any other point and shoot I've ever used.  Compared to my wife's Canon G10, pictures are sharper and noise is significantly less pronounced at high ISO.  Granted my 5D is a bit dated now, but it's still pro quality full frame DSLR and better than 80% of all DSLR's out there.  But the Leica's auto focus is significantly quicker to lock than my 5D with the 24-70 F2.8 L lens. Auto focus performance is comparable when I've got one of the prime L lenses on.  Don't mistake this review though, the D-Lux 5 will never hold a candle to the pics I get from my 5D. But for most everyday shooting, the D-Lux 5 is a beast.Main reason why the pics from the D-Lux 5 is so much better is the sensor size.  It's fairly large compared to most point and shoots. This is also why it gets much less noise at higher ISO compared other point and shoots.I know I could have bought the Panasonic, but this is also the perfect camera to pick up your first Leica like I did.

Fast forward 25 years and the D-Lux 5 delivers all the things I liked about my IIIf in a digital camera, without requiring a payout that could buy a car.I considered the Panasonic LX5, Leica D-Lux 5 and Leica X1.  While I liked the X1 it was more money than I wanted to spend, and I wanted a zoom lens.  The Panasonic was nice, and is essentially the same camera, but I didn't like the styling nearly as well.  The Leica has smooth lines while the Panasonic has a pseudo grip.The size and feel of the D-Lux 5 is perfect for me.  Easy to carry and easy to shoot.Controls are easy to understand and access.  I mainly shoot in Program Mode, and it is easy to manually adjust the exposure.The pop up flash is nice for outdoor fill of portraits (not too far away).  Also it is easy to adjust the flash power to not overpower a subject.The lens is fantastic.  24mm wide angle to 90mm telephoto cover all my needs.  Macro mode is incredible.

I think there is nothing wrong with the camera.  Like other things, you just have to know its limitations.  It is unreasonable to expect it to perform as well as a Canon DSLR.  In retrospect I had unrealistic and amateurish expectations.  With the various test shots in the previous update, I have now looked at them with both Lightroom 3 and Paintshop X3, both RAW and JPEG (FX33 JPG only).  When I zoom in on each of the pictures, I get basically the same results as I did when looking at them via the on-camera LCD.  But when I print A4 or even A3 size copies of shots I took along the Singapore River, the results are very satisfying.  I'll keep it and would recommend it to others.  A bit pricey, but you get Lightroom.

Die Kamera wird sofort erkannt und am Display erscheint die Meldung Zugriff. Habe mir eine SanDisk Extreme SDHC 30MB/s mit 16 GB Kapazit\u00e4t f\u00fcr die Leica D-lux5 gekauft. Sie ist flott bei den Kopiervorg\u00e4ngen (Dauer des Kopiervorgangs bei 15 Bild-Dateien mit der Gesamtgr\u00f6\u00dfe 174MB von Kamera auf PC dauern gemessen 29 Sekunden). Achtung: In der Bedienungsanleitung werden die maximalen Kapazit\u00e4ten in Abh\u00e4nigkeit zur Speicherkartentechnologie aufgef\u00fchrt. Vor Kauf einer Speicherkarte erst Bedierungsanleitung lesen, da nicht jede Speicherkartengr\u00f6\u00dfe unterst\u00fctzt wird.Videos am PC schauen:Die Betrachtung der ungeschnittenen Videos im *.MTS Format ist mit dem VLC Media Player (vlc-1.1.7-win32.exe) am PC m\u00f6glich.Brennen der Videodateien ohne Videoschnitt und ohne Tonbearbeitung.Die Videodateien werden so gebrannt, wie sie durch die Kamera aufgenommen wurden, genauer, wie sie auf dem Datentr\u00e4ger vorliegen. DVD Flick (dvdflick_setup_1.3.0.7.exe) dient dabei als Projektierung der DVD und als Encodierwerkzeug. Das Programm arbeitet mit IMGBORN (SetupImgBurn_2.5.5.0.exe) bestens zusammen.Brennen der Videodateien mit Videoschnitt und Tonbearbeitung.Installation der Codec-Sammlung ffdshow. W\u00e4hrend der Installation das Plugin f\u00fcr VirtualDub aktivieren.Decodierung der Videodateien in das *.AVI Format mit XMedia Recode (XMediaRecode2309_setup.exe). Dieses Programm will zwar einmalig nach der Installation telefonieren, l\u00e4\u00dft sich bei dem Versuch durch die Firewall direkt verweigern. Die Decodierung kostet je nach vorhandener Rechner-Power Zeit. Ich nutze einen 1,8 GHz single-Core Prozessor (Dell Latitude D810_CineBench R11.5-CPU-Test=0,42 Punkte =Dauer mehr als 15 Minuten) funktioniert aber auch. Videoschnitt mit VirtualDub 1.9.11 (VirtualDub-1.9.11.zip). Video-Schnitte mit den Pfeilen siehe untere Markierungen und dann Tastenkombi Strg x. Die geschnittenen Videosegmente speichern. Das Zusammenf\u00fcgen oder Binden von Vidiosegmenten: File - open video, File_Append Video Segment. Danach wieder speichern. Fertig. Andere Tonspuren lassen sich mit VirtualDub einf\u00fcgen.Brennen der Video DVD mit DVD Flick (dvdflick_setup_1.3.0.7.exe).", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pictures but...", "Author": "E Sikorski \"Mac/PC Support\"", "ReviewID": "R1UR2Z9UKOUKUC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the D-Lux 4. I don't own the D-Lux5 as I could not wait for its release date. But I was able to compare it to the newer D-Lux 5:-Dlux 5 has taller hotshoe mount-1yr Less warranty than the D-Lux 4-dial is prone to accidental setting change (better on 5 but not much)-Replaced joystick with wheel (better on 5)-Proprietary RAW format (RWL)-Better CCD on the 5-D-Lux 4 is 24mm-60mm where the D-Lux 5 is 24mm-90mm (35mm lens equivalent)-The D-Lux 5 can save to SDXC cardsImages on the Leica tend to be bias toward green as compared to Canon cameras. Easily corrected in Pshop (and about the only thing I usually correct, or crop)BTW, the Panasonic Lumix line (LX4, LX5) are the SAME inside, same camera, same lens, compared to the D-Lux 4 and D-Lux 5. Only the firmware in the Leica is different (and with the Leica you also get Adobe's Lightroom software so YMMV).One blog said that the Leica holds a better resale but I see the D-LUX4 sells used for $200 less than new, where the Panasonic Lx4 sells also $200 less than when new.It does a very good job shooting indoors over most and in low light exceeds.Things I would improve:- improve speed to save BOTH JPEG and RAW files (I had both a Class 6 and Class 10 SDHC card and it was slow to write)-Why do I need a bulky leather case that says \"I have a LEICA in here\";  just give me a wrist strap.-a wheel-lock just like the old SLRs had...

With more than doubled price and its well-known brand, I had bigger expectation for its performance in low light situation than Nikon P300.  It turned out to be a big disappointment for at least two reasons:1. Lots of noise in low light condition with high ISO.  Comparing with Cannon and Nikon, it is far from the standard in the digital world.2.
