Any custom settings are lost any time the camera is turned off, so it is impractical to use them.  It would take a few minutes to get the camera ready, and you would miss the shot.  Not even the flash setting saves.I am returning mine.  I would prefer a 3 Megapixel camera of higher quality to meet this price point.", "Date": "October 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Poor picture", "Author": "Mobi", "ReviewID": "R2TZRPY3Y9Y2TD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Takes poor quality picture.

It will also do Movies, and comes with the cable that plugs into the back of the TV or DVD player to show the movies or pics on the TV.  It also comes with it's own USB cable.  Just one thing that is a little upsetting, is the fact that most all the manufactures of digital cameras never give you batterys that last for more than Ten minutes. You will need to get a pair of CR-V3 rechargeables if you use it a lot as I do.  Other than that this little Digital Camera/Movie maker is Very Nice.

Hollander \"Online News Editor-RIS\"", "ReviewID": "R1KU3362WM60GH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I know several people who've said that this camera eats batteries, but I've not had that experience.  It will take up to a 512mb SD card and has a built-in 16mb memory chip that gets you 4 pictures in a pinch.  The LCD is bright and easy to use.  The camera has the standard Vivitar feature of the lens pushing out when you turn on the camera.  The quality of the prints is fine as long as you're doing 8x10's or smaller.  If you're using the flash in a really dark place, you will only have enough light for close up photos. If you're doing more than that, you're using the wrong camera - or get a slave flash.  I got this at woot.com for $100, but even at $200, it's a pretty good value.", "Date": "March 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Pleasure to Use", "Author": "Robert Dunkin", "ReviewID": "R1ZXOGC0XNE9EM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is very lite in weight and easy to use.

Pattee", "ReviewID": "R2K1U5N8NS1NEL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this digital camera as a gift last year (2004) for Christmas.  I got to use it a total of 5, maybe 6 times.  A month after I got it, something broke in the lens so I had to send it in.  I got a new camera & once again, a few months down the line, it broke again.  This time it would not focus any pictures.  So I sent it in again & got ANOTHER new camera & it again broke.  The screen would freeze & you would have to turn it off & on several times to get the screen back to normal.  Now I admit, I thought I was doing something wrong in all of this process.  I read the users manual front to back several times to make sure I was doing everything right and I was.  I just find it very odd that out of 4 cameras, they were all defective.When it did work, the time it took to take a picture was very long.  You would hit the shutter button & wait several seconds before it would take the picture causing blurriness & frustration.If you are also looking for a camera that puts the date on your pictures, this camera does not do that.  The camera also eats up batteries like you've never seen.I would not recommend this camera to anyone.  I have now gotten an HP digital camera and am extremely happy with it and have not had one problem.", "Date": "December 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "low cost camera adequate for beginners with good quality images", "Author": "Bman", "ReviewID": "R3DCAY3TH0TQES", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for almost 3 days now, in that time I have had 2yets of AA's die on me just playing around seeing how everything works.the quality of the pictures is good, not great, just what you would expect from something that costs $200 canadian funds in a field where it can cost upto $1000+ for a camera (something that costs THAT much had better be super high quality!).  aparently it can play video as well as take pics, I have tested this and the video recording is not bad, I have seen worse, just not from a digital camera :), the audio to go with the video recording however is horrible, the position of the microphone instead of in the front of the camera pointing TOWARDS whats being recorded, is in the top of the camera beside the power slider/button -thing.this is a decent camera for doing what it does.  as other reviews have said it can take a 512Mb sd card, but I could only afford a 128MB one after buying this camera, but you shouldnt need much more than that for a digital camera, video is a bit different but you're not filming a full length movie with it so you shouldn't really need a lot of space.the accessories the camera comes wit are USB cable, video cable (headphone plug  to AV audio and video (wth?!?)), 2 AA batteries (mine were Duracell Ultra's), manual, software cd, and a tight fitting carrying case.", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Decent pics, slow shutter, should have come with adapter plug", "Author": "PenThis", "ReviewID": "R2N5Q6HZXIKQXJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got a great deal at $79, so bought my first digicam. You have to buy a power adapter plug if you want it, as it doesn't come with (company sells for $25, you have to mail them a check). Pictures are decent (I don't know much about photography, but they come out nice IMO), but the problem is the speed. There is a ~2 second delay from the time I press the button to when it takes the pictures, and the subjects must stand still in order to not blur. So it's a pain in the rear to make people sit still, and taking photos of people walking/in motion (laughing) is out of the question. Isn't this not supposed to be a problem with digital cameras? Of course it eats up batteries like all digicams, so get a CRV3 lithium ion or high mA (I got 2500) lithium rechargeables (it also takes power to upload to a PC; I use my adapter plug for this). It's nice there's an option to NOT use the LCD screen if you're low on battery power. Need to buy a 512MB camera card, but one will hold ~325 pictures (at highest resolution). The cap on the front is nice (but cheap-looking); it's convenient that it pops off as soon as you turn it on (if you forget to take it off).
