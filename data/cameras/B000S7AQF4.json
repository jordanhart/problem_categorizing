I have worked with electronics for many years and personally, I am very disappointed in the quality of this product.  The conductors (the amount of actual wire) within each cable is so minimal that I was concerned about using them for my camera's power.  I purchased 6 of them and ended up not even using s single one- I just didn't trust power running through the very thin wires.  I researched online and ended up purchasing a different connector at a different place ([...]).  Disappointingly inferior quality!", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy Installation Product", "Author": "nightowl", "ReviewID": "R9O6DE9CCFWJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product makes security systems in automobiles very easy.
