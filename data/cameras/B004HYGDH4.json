It lasted the week that I needed it to, but after returning home, tried to use the camera and it said Lens Error.  It turns on, then makes a clicking noise and immediately turns off.I purchased a second pink Casio EXilim-EX-S5from Amazon the next month, believing that I broke the original camera,as my last digital camera was purchased (prior to these fancy tiny pink things)in 2000!  The new Casio survived for 6 months before the same lens error popped up.  I read somewhere that the lens retraction mechanism is very delicate and dust can prevent the lens from retracting.  I was quoted $85 to fix this.  Not worth the money the first time, let alone the second time!  Very frustrating, especially since I bought 2 memory cards for these cameras.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Grainy pictures, flimsy - do not recommend", "Author": "Chinook", "ReviewID": "RS26JA9C4J2VO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After searching for the cameras for hours on end, I decided to purchase the Casio EX-ZS5. I thought that you couldn't go wrong with a 14.1 mp camera, but boy was I wrong! This camera is super flimsy, picture quality is pretty bad (very grainy), and feels like it could break any second. Not to mention the zoom is absolutely useless! Don't get me wrong - this is not a terrible camera, but there are better ones out there for the same price (if not cheaper). I highly recommend the Kodak Easyshare C195. It takes crystal clear photos, is very sturdy, and is very cheap (I got mine for $79). You cannot go wrong with that camera.Do yourself a favor and avoid buying the Casio EX-ZS5!", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great quality for the price", "Author": "ellkay", "ReviewID": "R2WD00UCQ38S87", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this camera for 2 years before it broke (it was totally my fault, not faulty) and it's always worked like a charm.

Walton \"Allright Appraiser\"", "ReviewID": "R3QECYIFM78DCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little camera that didn't break the bank.  I use the camera appraising real estate and on average I take 50 pictures a day.  I bought this camera because I had gotten such great service out of a previous Casio Exilm (5mp) camera.  With my wife working in the business I needed another.  I've used the camera for several weeks now and am not disappointed.  The slightly wider view angle works great for my needs; the downside to that is that I think this impacts the magnification of the 5x zoom - doesn't seem much more magnification than the 3x zoom on the old camera.  Regardless it works perfectly for me.PS- some of the reviews indicated that the camera was delicate.  That has not been my experience.  I've dropped it several times and it has kept on ticking.  In my experience over the years using many cameras similar to this, drop any camera on the lense while it is extended will ruin it if it lands on the lense.  Otherwise these little cameras are reasonably rugged.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera for my Mom.", "Author": "Jessie Jones", "ReviewID": "R2TNHKV8466P9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "She loves it.
