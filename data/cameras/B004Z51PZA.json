(Update: Blackberry is no longer supported)-Cameras are completely wireless, allowing for extremely easy installation-Cameras seem to have a very decent range from the gateway.-No line of sight needed for the cameras, no problems for me going through walls and floors of brick, wood and drywall. Metal building supplies may pose issues though, but this will be the case with any wireless camera.-1 year of Premium service comes with the system, currently only $49.95 per year after that.-Snapshots/videos are recorded out to the website immediately, and can be played back from almost any internet connected computer.The bad:-Motion sensing does not work through glass.-Cannot set ignore times for motion sensing/alerting, it is either on or off for each camera.-Low-light performance leaves much to be desired. Despite several streetlights, no picture was visible in an area easily visible to the human eye.-Operating temperatures limited to 32\u00ba to 122\u00ba F, so mounting options will be limited to temperature controlled locations for most locations. (Update: per Avaak Tech Support, this is a limitation of the batteries, not the camera.)-Cameras have no wired power option, so you'll be using up batteries even in areas where you could easily connect wired power.-Fixed 60 degree field of view on the cameras is a bit limiting.Overall, the system is good with a few caveats. With more camera options, it would be great. Unfortunately, it appears Avaak has gone the other way, as the Outdoor rated camera has disappeared from their site.I would love to see cameras with an AC power option, an outdoor rated dome camera (Pan/tilt/zoom would be outstanding) and perhaps others integrated into the great gateway and website that Avaak has going for them.Update:Outdoor (waterproof) camera mounts are now available! This doesn't address the temperature restrictions of the batteries, but gives you a lot more flexibility in the mounting location. Avaak has changed their service plans several times from when this review was written, so check the latest account details on their site. They also run sales on the service renewal from time to time, so renew when the sales are going to save yourself a few bucks.My concerns with eating through the batteries seems to have been unfounded, as I'm still on the original batteries in all the cameras. Also, the sticky-back on the mounts should be looked at as a BACKUP to the screw slot on all but perfectly smooth surfaces. I had a camera take a nasty 8 foot fall onto concrete which left a crack in the housing, but it still works perfectly.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for basic use...", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "R1BCZJJ0Y88I93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my VUE SM2700 motion detection camera system up and running for about a week now, and so far so good! Installation really is a breeze, and the wireless cameras (and their mounts) are so convenient to use.  I have the receiver upstairs along with one of the cameras, and the other camera is downstairs.  Both cameras have perfect reception and the viewing resolution is better than I expected.  Also, there are three adjustable settings for the available lighting the room provides, which is accessed through the software so you can easily change the settings even when you are away.I tested the motion detection once, and it worked fine.  An email was immediately sent showing a video clip of the movement.  This can be adjusted from a 10 second or 40 second clip.  I will do more extensive testing at a later date, but so far it seems to work well.  The 2x zoom function also works well.  You get to decide what to zoom in on, and the resolution is excellent.  The movements on screen are a little laggy, but that is to be expected and really its not that bad at all.  If someone was removing something from your home, I think you would be able to get a clear shot at the persons face along some point of a 40 second motion video.  A lot also depends on how far you setup your cameras from the objects they may be viewing.  The brighter the available lighting and the closer the better.I have had zero issues using the software on a PC, IPAD, and on my Android phone.  They all three work perfect so far.  This is great news, something that actually works!So far I am very happy with this setup.  I will say that this is NOT a high end surveillance system so dont buy it with unrealistic expectations.  However, for basic home use I think you will be hard pressed to find anything better anywhere near this price range.  I only wish a future firmware upgrade will add a schedule setting that allows the motion detection to turn off/on at a certain time.  That way when you come home at 5pm everyday, you dont have to disable it manually.Otherwise, no real complaints!

Recently I purchased a condo in Florida. I was looking around for some type of security camera system for my condo that I could review over the internet. Having a second home I wanted to be able to view the cameras every day to make sure my property was secure from theft and/or damage from mechanical failure or weather related problems. Through my work I was involved with several projects dealing with camera web based technology, i.e., cameras in schools, malls, banks etc. that could be viewed by an officer from his car computer.These cameras are excellent, inexpensive and efficient little security devices that works well in my condo. First the setup is simple. The system comes with two wireless battery operated cameras, a network gateway with its own AC power adapter, four camera mounts for mounting your cameras, and an Ethernet cable. There is little computer system setup on the Vue network gateway. All you do is plug it into your router and synch the cameras. You are able to view immediately.I have recently purchased the new cameras that have motion sensors, which enables the cameras to automatically record videos or snapshots when they've been triggered by movements. Sensitivity for each camera's motion sensor can be adjusted on the web page. In addition to the recordings, I can receive e-mail notifications whenever motion is detected. Also I'm able to share the cameras with my family so they can view the property as well. I have recently recorded an alligator in the lake outside my patio window.Living over 3,000 miles away from my property in Florida and being able to view the cameras a couple of times a day makes our family feel more secure about our property.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lousey support.....

They say \"you must resync the camera by moving it closer to the base station...\"  I ask why I must 'resync' the camera if it was working before.  They don't know but will 'forward' my problem to the 'real' tech support who will get back tome in 24 hours (probably by email).The reality is there is no tech support.  There is only tech response by  email.  (support would be talking interactively to a knowledgeable person; not emailing every 24 hours back and forth)This camera is at best unreliable and inconsistent.  The tech support is non-existent.  If you need to rely on the camera or the company for consistent and reliable operation you should look at other cameras.  This camera and the company 'behind' it aren't setup to provide those needs.PS.  I just heard from Vuezone tech support.  They state that when sharing a camera link with someone else, if the other person 'forgets' to close their browser, it could run down the batteries and result in a dead camera.  This means that if you aren't at the camera location 100% of the time, you must 'educate' shared users about how to properly 'close' the camera viewing session so the battery isn't run down.  This makes a strong case for getting an AC powered camera.PSS.  Non working issue resolved.  I just got an email  (2 days after first contacted):  \"We reviewed the data from your system and were able to replicate the same issue you described. While investigating the issue, it appears to have cleared.

I returned these and found the Vue.It is so simple to setup and operate and doesn't need line of sight to the gateway  (most systems do) - doesn't even need to be hardwired to a gateway; and a computer system is not required.  It is truly a wireless system; and each camera works the same as an intelligent laptop camera with WI-FI that can be controlled on your own designated web site with zoom and lighting adjustments by user.  Because it is battery operated, you don't have to locate it near a power outlet- really gives you lots of flexibility in where to locate your cameras.  Quality of the camera picture is excellent--as good as most hand held cameras.  If you have a wireless router, you just have to plug in the gateway and mount the cameras -- about as easy as hanging a small picture on a wall, it's that easy.Some insurance companies offer a discount on a home policy if you have a video monitoring system that can alert you if motion is detected; so the system could be paid for with Home insurance savings.

I researched several options including a hard wired security type system with DVR, IP network cameras and monitoring systems such as Logitech & Dropcam.The Vue system is incredibly easy to set up- you hook up the base station to your router, insert the batteries into the cameras push a sync button and that's it. Placing the cameras and aiming them actually takes much longer than set up but even that is easy & really doesn't take long just take your laptop to check the angles of the cameras and you're done. Setting up a Vue account is simple & quick too - create an account -set up motion detection, email alerts and etc. There is also an app for your Android, Iphone or Blackberry this too is quick and easy. Total time invested for system setup, camera placement and account setup & Android app setup for me was less than an hour. I recently added a third camera -again insert batteries, push the sync button & place the camera - 15 minutes or so -most of that was camera placement and aiming.The cameras are about the size of a roll of tape and most people don't notice them even when placed in plain site. The down side to the cameras is a narrow field of view. I have 2 placed in my dad's 10 x 12 bedroom and would need to add 2 more to capture all areas of the room. Note that there is no night vision capability, not a big deal for me but maybe for some.  We've had the system for 2 months or so with the cameras running 24/7 and the batteries still show full charge. I bought replacement batteries just in case - they run around $18 for ten.The VueZone app works great on my Samsung Vibrant phone I can access the cameras while on the go with ease. However, after installing the app on my wife's identical Vibrant she continually gets a \"cameras disconnected\" error when signing in on a \"friend\" account w/ permission to view the cameras. I have emailed VueZone about this & initially received several prompt responses (always within 1 business day) but have so far been unable to resolve even after removing & re-loading the app and following all other directions from Vue - finally they said they would consult their lab people and respond -it's been almost a month and no reply. I've sent follow-up emails which have been ignored. As with our IT guys @ work -silence usually means they're stumped & have chosen to hope I will go away.Similarly I am unable to view the cameras from my work PC but that's likely due to our firewall settings.This is a good, reasonably priced MONITORING system. If you want/need home security to be the primary function there are much better & more expensive choices out there. If you need to check on elderly family members, kids or pets remotely this is a viable, cost effective option - just be forewarned that their service & support has become somewhat suspect in my case.Update 8/12/11: 2 days short of 30 days since my last inquiry into the access issue on my wife's phone I received the following email from Vue Zone Support: \"Thank you for your patience as we looked into your issue.

I read all the reviews, so I knew exactly what to expect as far as the service plan requirements for most features, etc. With these things not being a surprise and having my expectation level appropriately set, I am really impressed so far with this little system.I received it the other day, and I didn't think I'd set it up until the weekend and thought I'd just open the box and have a look. Well, it was so ridiculously simple and quick to set up, I just went ahead and did it within the span of maybe 15 minutes. The trickiest part was placing/aiming the camera where I wanted since my computer is in another room and I kept going back and forth to see how I was doing. After some reading, I realized that having the camera running constantly would drain the batteries pretty fast (you don't want to just leave it \"playing\" and on a window on your computer or whatever; it's not like it's plugged into the wall, the batteries will drain doing that). Their website cites \"normal\" use as about 5 minutes per day, so take the hint.Yesterday was the first \"test\" day as I wanted to get alerts when my dog passed through the room. At first I set the video clips for 10 seconds, but I was getting bombarded with email alerts every minute (I hadn't realized my old dog was scampering around the house so much all day!). I changed it to 40 second clips, but I still got bombed with alerts. I'm going to have to experiment with the sensitivity settings or something so that I can leave the motion detector/alerts on for security purposes w/o having my little Jack Russell indirectly emailing me all day long.The video quality is better than I expected from reading other reviews. Yes, it is certainly not HD, but it's clear enough for the purpose. The iPhone app is actually pretty cool in my opinion and I think they've probably sold me on signing up for the service plan. When I bought this system, I expected to be happy with the free basic service. I don't think what they are charging is exorbitant, and you can't really expect them to give away storage space, etc. for free. I guess I feel better about it than some because of the great lightening deal I got, and that I didn't used to get these services for free before they started charging. I can imagine I would be irritated by that.I plan to test this out just a bit longer, then will probably add at least one more camera. I will put one in my kids' upstairs play room to be able to take a quick peak at them when I think they may be up to no good.

I stuck with it, having no other reliable options available.And things have improved greatly!Only 1 web downtime in the past month, and that was for only 1 hour for maint (a popup message displayed).The camera pricing has dropped a bit. And new lower membership pricing. Both get A+ for improvement.I have to add this monitoring system is very good. Especially reliable using my iPhone.I will change my original star rating from 2 stars to 4. Would earn 5 stars if 100% security system, which they aren't, naturally.And I now \"would\" recommend this system/cameras for casual home or site monitoring.The system is very functional and I am still on the original batteries getting full meter levels.Not for high security needs, but for casual monitoring this system is worth the cost. Smart phone support is the major advantage.Yes... I can now easily recommend this system for giving a little peace of mind while away from the home.I have never once had to recycle the system or cameras. They always work as long as the web is up.The system has always recovered on its own, after a home power outage due to a few bad storms.The system has always come back online \"ON IT'S OWN\" as soon as the power and internet was back up. 5 stars for that !!!I now plan to add more camera's very soon!Vuezone very much is option to try or consider for casual monitoring.And they have added a optional cam-shell add-on for purchase, for I guess camera protection adding outside monitoring.Vuezone obviously is working hard and attentive to make a very good system even better.***** UPDATE 11/18/11*********Not only is the vuezone web down quite a lot, it is also taken offline often for maint. Again... totally unacceptable. The vuezone camera system is nothing more than a toy. Un reliable for any type of security monitoring. When the site is down, cameras are useless. And the site is down \"A LOT\". Add to that, vuezone has the nerve to actually charge a monthly fee.******* UPDATE 10/13/2011 ***********I am finding the vuezone website is down several times throughout the night on many occasions.Due to this, the cameras are naturally non accessable remotely. This is totally unacceptable!!!!!I will be returning my camera system to amazon.I was afraid of this happening when using a system that relies on access through the company website.Any site maintenance that causes loss of access to the camera system is totally unacceptable. Period!!!I expect =ZERO= down time on the part of any company where camera access is only possible using the website.*************************************I've tried many web enabled camera's for home monitoring. None work as advertised. Usually some connection issues or camera dropping offline and needing a reboot. Not possible when away from home, naturally. D-Link web camera's are one of the many that totally fail at reliable home monitoring. And I've tried them all.This vuezone system, so far, has been reliable using my iPhone-4 with 3g connection and the vuezone iphone app.System setup was not smooth, however. After connecting the receiver to the router, the camera's failed to connect. Only after unplugging the receiver unit and doing the opposite of what the instructions say to do, did the cameras connect.So far remotely, the system has connected via my iPhone and offered reliable monitiring. But this system is way too costly for what it's worth. The 2 camera + receiver unit system should sell at half the asking price. No live audio. And the video goes thru, and relies on the vuezone company website to furnish your video from your home location to your viewing location. So I wonder what happens if vuezone goes belly up in the future? All these systems will be worthless? Since the system relies on vuezone to relay your video?A little scary if you ask me. Especially for the high cost of the system and the fact you also have to pay a monthly membership to vuezone for anything beyond basic camera services.Not good!This is your risk to consider... Investing in a costly limited video monitoring system, plus paying beyond that a monthly fee for premium service, then hoping the company is still in operation one or two years down the road. The whole thing sounds a little like a gimmick to me. Selling low end video hardware at high end prices, then having the whole system only operational as long as the company is in business. If vuezone fails to remain in business, you will be stuck with hundreds of dollars in useless paper weights.The system, as a remote monitoring system via phone apps, is so far working fine for me. But I have to weigh if the future risks with this investment is really worth it in the long run. I have 30 days to decide via the Amazon return policy, thank goodness.PS. I have to add the fact that these camera's are battery, no wires at all, does make the system user friendly in that you get 4 wall stickem's (magnets) with the camera kit, where the little camera sticks to it magnetically. So if you need a camera here, or there, depending on the day or monitoring need, it is simple to grab the camera off it's magnet mount in one room, and take to it another room and stick it in that room on the magnet mount. Just grab and stick up. What could be easier?Plus... the \"ball\" stickem magnet mount makes it simple to adjust the camera view angle. No hardware or screws to mess with. It's a camera with a magnet that sticks to a round wall stickem-up ball magnet. So easy to adjust the viewing angle. And while I have a fairly large home (3 levels) the camera's have kept connection to their base no matter what room in the house I placed a camera. That was a plus for me.Battery operation for some may be a drawback. I find it to be very functional and user friendly mounting system. Just stick the camera where you need it for the day/night via the magnetic connection wall mount. You get 4 wall mounts, so you can place the wall mount in the 4 rooms where monitoring is needed most.Wall mounts can either be attached with the sticky peal-off back, or hung on a wall screw. The little camera's also have a flat bottom base, so it can be set flat on a table or shelf. And because the camera's are totally wireless (battery operated), you have no nearby power supply or wall outlet issue to deal with.NOTE: For a battery operated camera system, and with Wi-Fi, this is no doubt the most convenient monitoring system you will come across. That is until the battery dies.HOWEVER... the company claims a 6 month battery life under normal use. And as a PLUS I might add, is the iPhone or computer live monitoring screen also displays a battery level meter, so you know where the battery life stands.The live battery meter display makes up for the possible short comings of using a battery operated camera system.You can easily tell when time is at hand to change the battery's.

You can set the sensitivity of the motion detection, the light affecting the camera, and zoom all from the internet or your smart phone.The cameras are battery operated so there are no cords or wires! They mount magnetically to the little domes that you put on the wall so you can move the cameras around as you please.It is so nice to be able to check on them while we're gone and have peace of mind that they have everything they need. When it comes to no-nonsense home security and monitoring... It is SO easy to use!

EZ EZ EZ setup, no programming or even a computer necessary2. no wires to run3. really EZ cool magnetic swivel mounts with tape backing4. motion sensing camera recordings with email notification5. up to 25 cameras can be used6. recording stored offsite at Vuezone and can be downloaded later7. droid app that works fine with my phone or you can view cameras straight off the browser, either way.cons1. since it is wireless, picture resolution will not be premium, don't expect commercial resolution2. since it is wireless and battery operated, distance from wireless router is very limited, make sure your specific situation (i.e. mounting distance from your wifi) is sufficiently close for two way communication.I'm sure this system is not for everyone, but it works great for me. I have the motion camera mounted on my front door so that whenever someone comes to my front door, they are recorded and an email is sent to both my droid phone and my other email accounts with the recorded video event.I'm going to buy two more systems, one for my office and one for my parents house", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "very easy to set up, nice resolution, would like more features.", "Author": "M.

I've already got my non-tech oriented husband set up to view the cameras using his android phone (okay I had to install it for him but he can now use it on his own).The camera set up was easy, connecting the receiver to the router was easy, getting on to the web site and creating an account linked to my product was a complete breeze.  Getting the cameras set at the right angle was probably the most complicated thing and even this was very easy -- especially with the ability to have a cell phone right at the site of the camera to ensure the angle is right without having to run back and forth to the computer.The camera's are much smaller than a previous system I have used.  I like this because they are not as easy to see so people may not know they are being monitored.  I still keep the bigger one up and plugged in as a decoy.Things I wish were present1. the ability to stream directly to my computer and record directly to my computer or external hard drive.2. ability to remotely control panning3. better low light resolution / infrared technology for night or dimly lit areas4. a more common battery type -  I use rechargeable AA/AAA batteries.  This are odd batteries and not rechargeable.  :/ (not happiness)5. outdoor rated cammerasOver all though I'm impressed and like the price point compared to other products with similar features.The ease of set up goes a long way.

I've had the same issue with another camera I've owned Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera Wireless 802.11 and no longer use. So, those network camera systems may be great products, but they couldn't work well with my unreliable WiFi.In terms of picture quality, the videos and pictures don't look great on a large monitor, but on a mobile phone, or even an iPad, they look fine.  Most important, I can see what I need to see.The reason why this VueZone camera system works better for me is that it has its own router, which is connected to my router via Ethernet (not wirelessly).

It is very easy to use and install.  Why did I give it one star you ask,  because the software needs improvement and the fee's charged to use it are ridiculous given it's limitations. The free service allows only 2 cameras and no alerts or mobile phone access. The next level is good for only for 5 cameras.  This is not enough even for a modest home give the limited viewing angle.  Here is where they are shooting themselves in the foot.  If you allow at least 10 cameras for the basic paid plan, you will sell more hardware and give customers a more useful system.  I don't see how anyone will be whiling to pay for the premiere service that allows more cameras but is too expensive. On the bright side I do like that you can set it up to record video when motion is detected.  You will receive an email with a link to the video.  This is great because if someone does break into the house the video is stored safely in the cloud.  Another big problem is that the cameras do not automatically adjust themselves to light.  This is a big problem because if you set it up for night view you get a washed out picture during the day and if you set it up for bright light you get no picture at night.  The manufacturer has not plans to fix this issue.  Also, it would be nice to have a way to quickly turn motion on or off on all cameras at the same time.Pros1. Very small2. Long battery life3. Completely wireless so you can place it just about anywhere and move it as needed4. Very long range5. Motion detection works well6. Can be setup to record to the cloud when motions is detected7.

The cameras are still going strong, working well and I finally signed up for the premium service for $5.47 with tax. I'm very pleased with this product and service. Thanks Netgear!Ordered the VueZone System with one camera to feel secure in a sketchy neighborhood. For the price, I'm impressed it works. Everything was in the box (I read reviews that the batteries or cord was missing). The batteries, ethernet cord, camera mounts, camera and receiver (router) arrived in the box, brand new.VueZone's website has online directions for setting up the camera. The system is very easy to set up for anyone. No technical experience is needed (in my opinion). You plug in the receiver with provided power cord and connect the ethernet cable to your router, place the provided batteries into the camera and sync. Very easy. The clarity of the video is good. It's not hd, but you can see faces and it's a better picture than expected. The phone app is available from Google Play off VueZone's website and works with the Boost Samsung Prevail Galaxy (reviewed). Took me less than ten minutes to the open box, read the directions and get the camera working online.The camera system earns bad reviews because of the service plans. I understand people being dissatisfied their cameras are (now) requiring payment to operate. This does not affect the basic service (allows one camera to be viewed on a computer). It's up to the individual to decide if paying for the extra cameras and phone app is worth the money. The rates are NOT super expensive.A sticker for the area being monitored (such as ADT gives their customers) needs to be included or offered. Would be awesome to let people know they are being recorded and broadcasted. The program needs updating and connecting issues fixed. The camera disconnects when another program is opened (sometimes). Basically, you can view your camera but do nothing else on your computer. A good programmer can fix that snafu. There's not too much visibility at night. A night vision camera would be the best addition to VueZone's two camera models.Overall it's REALLY easy to set up and gets a good picture. You can move the camera around without being strangled by cords and view it on your phone. Cool to me so far.

Companies that specialize in home security want lots of money to set up a viewable home monitoring system if they even offer one at all.  I decided to wait until I could find something that would work for my needs.  The VueZone system seemed to fit the bill.  When Amazon had the VueZone on a goldbox deal, I decided to roll the dice and see how it worked.  Truth be told, when the system arrived, I stuffed it into a cabinet and forgot about it for a month or more because I wasn't in the mood to goof around with it.  Most technology doesn't work properly right out of the box and I didn't have time to troubleshoot any problems.  When I finally did get around to pulling the system out and setting it up, it literally didn't take me more than 5 minutes.  This couldn't be any easier.  I plugged the base unit into the wall and my router.  I put the included batteries into the camera and pressed a button on the base unit to sync the camera with the base unit.  I then found a place in my home to put the camera.  The kit comes with several \"ball\" wall hangers.  You just peel the plastic off the back and stick it anywhere you like (they do caution you about the adhesive possibly messing up your walls, but I believe they have adhesive removers to handle such issues).  You'll have to log on to VueZone online to set up an account and choose your level of service.  You can either get the free service which supports two cameras, or the premier service which supports 5 camera.  I got the premier service on sale for $36 for the year.  Once online you can view your camera right away and the pictures are cystal clear and fantastic!  I'm so pleased with a product that delievers just what they promise.  I can now leave town and not only check in on my home from my computer, but from my android smartphone as well!  I have three cameras in various places inside my home and two cameras positioned at the front and back door.  I can always get a clear picture as long as the lights are on.

I bought the first VueZone camera and wireless base 2 years ago with an additional camera at over $275. I had every intention of expanding later to 4 cameras if it met my needs, which I did a year later, at another $100 each. There was no warning that these cameras were only useable for 1 year before the company would \"turn off\" two of them unless I subscribed for a 4 camera setup with an annual fee. This was not disclosed up front when I bought the system 2 years ago. Now I have two \"disconnected\" and useless cameras unless I pony up.  Two dead cameras, poor frame rate, expensive batteries, and expensive service plan...I feel ripped off.  If you must have it, just buy the two camera system ONLY.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera with a warning about the additional cost to use all of its features!!!", "Author": "Busymomonthego", "ReviewID": "R1O54VRZTVO61A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First...the warning (visit their website and read thoroughly before purchasing):I purchased two of the motion censored cameras to monitor the activity in my home while I'm at work (I have a teenager...).  Set up was quick and very easy which is a great thing...but...make sure you read everything thoroughly before purchasing because there is a catch!  The advertisements talk all about the systems great online features and how you can view it from your smartphone and add up to 15 cameras, etc....but read very carefully because in order to access these features, you must pay an annual fee.  The basic service only allows you to sync up to 2 cameras and you can only view the cameras from your computer.  You need to pay their premier or elite fees in order to add additional cameras, receive any alerts or use any of the cameras features.  Here's the link to their service plans: [...]The pros:Again, set up was really fast and easy!  The cameras themselves work great and the picture quality is really good for the price.  With the annual premium service package, I like that I can login anytime and take a video or a snapshot, even if the motion sensor wasn't triggered.  One of my big concerns was that I would waste my online memory space because I have 2 cats and I thought they would trip the sensors all day...but they didn't.The cons:I wish the cameras would come with rechargeable batteries instead of regular ones.  The battery life doesn't last very long and since I am using mine 5 days per week....those batteries can get expensive.  (They don't take regular AA  or AAA batteries)  Make sure you know where you want to place the mounts before sticking them because I made a mistake and when I tried to peel it back off....it ripped the paint clean off.  The stick very well!  The view is a bit narrow which was a slight disappointment but not enough for me to not use the cameras.  It is a bit of a pain to have to turn each camera on and off morning and night.  It would be nice if they included a shut off feature in that premier package we have to pay for.  The only other problem I found is when the camera is activated.  Maybe I misread the product slightly but I didn't realize the camera will will only take about 3-4 snapshots when someone walks in its range and because we walk somewhat fast, we appear blurry.  The surroundings are perfectly clear but depending on where you place the camera, you may not capture anything in the image unless there is a large area for a person to walk....long enough for the camera to capture something.  If you pay for the premium service, you can log online and take a snapshot or a video from your cameras at anytime but the video feature only works when you login and click it.  Otherwise, it's just those little quick snapshots.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "I Spy", "Author": "D. Wortham", "ReviewID": "RMIHHIB3JTBRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary: Very simple to use. Very quick setup. Very little technical knowledge needed. No sound. Video quality good overall but not good for detail. Frames per second poor - from 1fps to 8fps. So expect choppy video. Resolution is 640x480. Not super bad but far from excellent. There is a higher resolution but it doesn't look like it is available with the current router. Cell phone usage is where it shines. Verdict: recommended with reservations and conditions.I've been interested in getting a security camera system for a while now so when this became available for free to review on the Vine program I eagerly selected it.The good:  Setup is very easy. The out of box experience is really very good. Everything you need is in the box including the batteries to run the wireless cameras. You must have a router (your dsl modem or cable modem) with a port free to use with the included camera router.Pairing the camera(s) with the router is a snap. You can tell that the company put a lot of thought into making this as pain free as possible and they succeeded admirably.I was viewing my remote camera within minutes of opening the box - 10 minutes tops!Some of the things I've been using my camera system for: Keeping an eye out for the family coming home loaded with groceries I need to go help unload; watching for the UPS guy; seeing if the dog wants back in; etc...Let me touch on a few of the things I think are bad:1 - video is choppy. The frame rate is about 3 to 4 frames a second. So, while you can see things and people moving for real security where you need smooth video this system isn't adequate. For you paranoid parents out there spying on the babysitter with this level of frame rate it is entirely possible you'll miss the slap and just see the move to and away from the now crying child. This is something Vue is working on so if that is your need you might contact them before purchasing - ask them about frame rates.2 - video takes at least 5 seconds to start playing if you are trying to start the live feed. Not really a big deal just something to note.3 - viewing from the computer browser is highly annoying. There are two sizes to view, danged small and full screen. What that means is that you cannot do anything else while viewing the camera on your computer. The way the web page is designed, even if you have the camera in its own browser window you cannot reduce the window size to just the camera view port so it still takes up a lot of screen space. I have a 23inch LCD monitor. The thing is the small view doesn't show much detail. The full screen view shows quite a bit of detail but it really is full screen, no borders or anyway to scale it down.4 - motion sensor. Depends on what you'll be using it for. It is a heat based sensor so the cat may not set it off. It can detect humans up to 15 feet away. But I'm not sure how the outdoor camera would work on a hot day and my kit only came with two indoor cameras. If this feature is important to you then you should contact Vue before you purchase and explain what you need so you can be sure this system will meet your needs.5 - you *must* view the camera across the internet at their website. There is no way to view it without using the internet. That may be important if you have an ISP that really, greatly, restricts data usage. Given the frame rate I don't see the data usage as a real issue but if your internet access is down for any reason your cameras are effectively off line.6 - yearly fee. You get a free membership with the purchase of the system. You cannot record video with the free membership but you can always view a live feed. They have one paid membership level, currently about $50 and a higher feature level membership in the works for about $100. Both are yearly fees so pretty reasonable I think.---Okay those were the things I didn't like or took note of that may affect your decision to buy.Based on those things I was prepared to give this system 3 stars.Did I mention that you can view the camera feed on your smart phone? No? Well, I didn't find out till recently that it was possible for my phone. You see, their website lists about 6 phone models and my andriod LG Optimus M wasn't one of them. I just assumed that they knew what their software would run on.Turns out they don't know. I looked them up in the Android marketplace, found the app and installed it. Viola!How to go from 3 stars to 5 stars in one simple step: Make it available for smart phones.This is where the system really shines! It solves the problem of not being able to do anything else while viewing the camera on the computer because you can just set your phone to the side and keep an eye on the camera while you continue working at the computer.When you are at the house and want to view the camera you don't have to use the computer. So, if you are doing the dishes you can keep an eye on the kids without having to have your laptop on the counter where it might get wet or fall off.When you are away from the house, and really that is when you most want to see what is going on, you just log in and within 30 seconds or so you are seeing what's happening. Very cool.You can arm the motion sensor or trigger a recording from your phone. You can start and stop live viewing.One thing about the smart phone app, at least on my android phone, you need to hit the sub-menu key and tap the 'log out' menu choice. Otherwise next time you open the app you will just get a dark screen or an error message about failing to connect.So, all in all, for the price I think it is a wonderful entry level system into the world of remotely keeping an eye on things. Carefully consider what you'll be using the camera for and look at some of the things I noted as possible drawbacks and make an informed decision. If the bad things I pointed out are not an issue for you then I think you'll enjoy having this system.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy ...VERY EASY", "Author": "James F.

I took it out of the box and and had it working in 5 min. Then I went and stuck YES STUCK (no drill or tools) the cameras up and BAM they worked.  I have a problem getting WIFI in one of the rooms but the camera signal worked in that room. Because of the plug and play ability alone I give it 4 stars and the other star is because I like it.I have now gone on the web site and signed up for a year of service (you get one month free) and ordered two more cameras. I set up the motion camera to email me when there is motion so anyone walks into the room I have it set up to send instant email on my iPad and bag I click on the app and I can see what is going on. Even set it up to save the 40 sec video online so if they take all the equipment I have a copy online.So just think how cool it is to be out of your house and your iPhone/iPad dings at you and you check the email to see \"motion in garage\" you then check the App or open the email to the view the video of your son coming home early from school. That took about 30 sec tops from motion in house to you knowing what was going on.  Priceless. Then you text him to please shut the garage door. Speechless.This is not HD video quality recording ....

If looking outside, can't handle a sunny day.My take:  I'm feeling cheated because when I bught it there was no mention of monthly fee for a 'Premium' subscription that allows use of mobile app or more than 2 cameras.

Viewing remotely from a cell phone was a must.I also didn't want to spend $1,000, and didn't want to have to run wires or deal with complicated installation.So, I saw the VueZone on sale for approx $180 w/ 2 cameras, and figured I would give it a shot.Installation is SUPER easy and only took me 10 minutes.  The camera mounting system is great.  You just stick a round magnetic base anywhere on the wall, and the camera attaches to it with a magnet, so you can easily move the camera around on the base to change the view of the room.  I was easily able to get a full view of each room.  Before mounting, you just hold each camera near the base and push \"sync\" and the cameras are automatically synced to the base.  The base connects to your router/modem via ethernet cable with no additional set up necessary.You can then login to the VueZone website and look at your cameras, or view from a cell phone on the app.  I was able to do this very easily.  The cameras do not automatically record.  Since they are wireless, they have batteries that would drain down if they did.  They turn on when you view them, then turn off.  You can also set them to motion record, and either email you the video, or store the video/picture on the vuezone website.One negative is that if you want to use anything more than 2 cameras w/ basic viewing, you need to sign up for a VueZone membership for $5/mo.  Based on how easy this system is to use, and how inexpensive it is, I have no issue paying $5/mo for the service.  But keep that in mind when considering your purchase, as there are other, more expensive systems, that do not require a monthly fee.All in all, this system does exactly what I bought it for, and I am buying extra cameras right now for more coverage.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I think for the price and the equipments intented purpose....it is GREAT!", "Author": "Brad Pejsa", "ReviewID": "R3D1PL2JPL3T01", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the unit for about a month.

I have used these for almost six months and the battery levels are not even down one bar.  This is phenomenal for a wireless system.  I was afraid that the batteries would die all of the time; they don't.3) The picture quality is amazing for the size of the camera.4) The clever magnetic attachment system makes these work anywhere.

I have even hung them upside down and the magnets are much stronger than gravity.5) They have never crashed or been unavailable.  I have had zero down time in nearly six months.In short, they are excellent.

However this product, while useful, is really not a satisfactory security solution.If you read the fine print, you will find that when the camera detects motion, it then still has to warm up for a minute before it starts recording.  That means that whoever triggered the motion detector may already have passed out of range of the camera.Even worse, it seems that there is a glitch in the activation of multiple cameras in succession.  I left three cameras in motion detection mode when I went on a recent vacation.  Before leaving, I checked that each one did indeed activate and record when I walked in front of it.  When I got home again, I decided to test the system by leaving it on as I entered the house.  I walked in front of all three cameras as I came in and put things away.  But only one camera activated and recorded.A minor note:  my experience with setup was not quite as smooth as most report.  I was using an old ethernet hub to split the one port on my base station, and it turned out that the hub was not fast enough to support the Vuezone equipment.

It's not a cost effective product.*************I'm an IT professional... and I specialize in Computer and Network security.  The only reason to say this at all relates to the amount of TRUST you have to place into VueZone, and the reasons I'm not sure this product deserves it.Pros:1) It's a neat concept.2) The equipment is very small.3) The product is, supposed to be, plug and play.Cons:1) The product requires online activation2) The \"Premium\" server stores content in \"the cloud,\" and there is no guarantee expressed indicating absolute privacy or telling you who's cloud?3) You are given a gateway router for the cameras that plugs into your network, and it can be logged onto.*4) * VueZone doesn't tell you how to logon to YOUR gateway appliance... only the website; they seem to be going out of their way to prevent you using the system locally.5) The VueZone servers tend to drop connections easily, and there are issues with IE 9 and Firefox 11.0 with updating the firmware on the cameras6) If you get the camera system up and running (it appears that you have to contact them to register them system some times), the system takes a considerable amount of time to post your recordings to your \"Libray.\" This is especially true of larger recording that approach your account limit.7) You can only watch one camera at a time, and you can not watch ANY of the cameras if one of them is taking time lasped photos.  (The minimum time for time lapse of one camera is 1 minute.)8) 6 hours of high resolution time lapse photos take up 60MB, and then about 1 hour to be able to view it online.  So far, I've been unable to get the download to work.  This could be related to using a newer secure browser...My experience:I purchased this some time ago directly from the company. When I finally took it out of the box to install it, I noticed that not only did it take awhile to get the unit, but that it had been previously opened.  (Was I sent a unit that was returned?)I then went ahead an attempted to register the unit.  Two times it failed to do so, indicating that I had to call customer service.  So much for a smooth and easy to use product... I then logged into my account (which I had to create in order to purchase the product), and associated the Gateway device with my account.

Otherwise, if that's not the problem, than the product itself is flaky OR they're product activation is flaky.  Also, there is a limited market for people that want a product the can't be used as a stand alone device only.Now, if you use any sort of industrial firewall, it's going to be blocking all attempts at speaking to the outside world.  This means that you have to open a vast array of network ports for the device to speak to the internet / VueZone.

It really couldn't be easier.The picture/video quality is ok. It's not high definition but it is more than adequate for my needs. Can clearly recognize faces. More fps would be good and hopefully will come in the future.My camera is outside the door to my condo unit (interior not exterior) so I am able to see who is at the door without going to the door. I also have it set up for motion detected video.The motion detection needed to be adjusted to get it right for the location. I lowered the sensitivity level to 10. The field of \"sensitivity\" is wider than the field of \"view\" so at the higher sensitivity levels it would record when people walked by the door but out of view. Now it only triggers recordings when they are in the field of view.I have it set to send me an email when there is motion detected. The email comes quickly and the whole recording can be watched by tapping the image on my iPhoneThe iPhone app is more limited than the computer website for options but does what I need it to.The website functions are simple easy and intuitive.The camera base has a hole to hang it from a hook or you can peel off the paper and stick it to the wall/door. The camera then attaches to it with a magnet. The camera can be then directed in unlimited ways.I gave it 4 stars because I think it's a bit pricey and the fps are low for the price but as I said I got what I expected and it's doing what I need it to, so I am pleased.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a great system and is easy to set up!", "Author": "Renata Circeo", "ReviewID": "R3HQ8TURZJCHTB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have lake vacation property and wanted to keep an eye on the outside areas for security purposes.

The system operates on the unregulated 2.4 GHz ISM band, which is the same segment used by Wi-Fi (802.11 b, g, n), some cordless phones, and microwave ovens. VueZone incorporates frequency-hopping technology (FHSS) to minimize interference but if you have a wireless router you will want to set the base station as far away as possible or contact tech support to set your router on a different frequency.2. The documentation does not clearly tell you which features are available for the Admin account vs Friend accounts. For example, Full-Screen mode,  which looks great BTW, is only available for the Admin.ConclusionsNot a perfect system, but cannot be beat for the money.Did I mention the system looks great? It does. It's a well-thought-out package down to the details of its optional components. From a hardware perspective it's a solid marriage of function and design.Hopefully the company will address some of the web-based software glitches and add features to the video recording and library functions. Aside from that this product is a winner.Update: 10-27-2012--------------------It's been six months.  Have maxed-out the system with five cameras.  Still happy with the purchase.

Kudos to them for their proactive customer support... I'm sure that eventually we would have gotten it to work, if I hadn't already sent it back to Amazon.Their initial diagnosis (based on their own server logs) was that a firmware update was required... or in other words, the hardware was shipped in a non-functional state and needed \"fixing\".  I had been notified during the setup process that an update was needed, but the update process also failed repeatedly.Even if the hardware worked, though, I still didn't like the fact that the features of the Basic plan are VERY limited, contrary to the product description.

Here's an example.  I went online for support this morning and was routed to Netgear's technical support site.  It asked me to enter my product serial number before proceeding with Live Chat, so I entered the Vuezone serial number.  The system wasn't able to find it which meant it wouldn't let me proceed with the support session.I also have other Netgear products (switches, etc...) and although their products are acceptable, the technical support and sales support is very weak.  Netgear hasn't yet learned that offshoring all technical support to people that work from scripts and have a poor command of the English language may be an \"inexpensive\" way to provide support, but the customer experience suffers greatly as a result.  I would pay a little more for my products if I could get US based customer support with excellent English skills.Want information on their home or small business products?

Found the best advice was one given by a reviewer who had wasted many hours trying to make one work. He said if you cannot get it to work within an hour, don't waste your time like he did.  It's either going to work in your particular situation or not.There are many reasons for this.  You can find them in other reviews. Many are simple, like some software not accepting certain character or spaces, others are technically complex.Having said that, I found this camera to be very easy to install and connect to my internet modem/router (about 2 minutes). If you are tech savvy and do not plan to use the VueZone website service, it might just work for you, otherwise, read on.I have a very simple situation: phone company modem/router, no network. It does not get simpler than that. The problem I ran into was the VueZone website, to which you have to connect to view your images via internet. This website is a nightmare.  False errors, false navigation, freezing up, etc.  This is all before I even got to register the camera to it!  When it finally registered it, it was telling me that I had a bad connection, even though the lights on the camera were telling me it was properly connected.  I tried everything I could think of for over an hour then decided to follow that wise reviewer's advice and returned it. Hard to believe their \"user\" website is so bad when their \"marketing\" website is so impressive.I should note that I also bought an Astak Mole IP camera, also from Amazon, and that connected and got registered on the suggested Yoics website beautifully in 10 minutes and has been working fine since.

Means", "ReviewID": "R1AI3RF7M4YNKI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I was pretty impressed with the VueZone Personal Video Network. As advertised, it was very simple to set this up and get it working; amazingly easy! You should know in advance that to use this system you must first have an internet ready computer and a router to connect to. VueZone has a detailed privacy policy and so take steps to ensure that your images and videos are stored securely; so only you can access them on their server. You will get 2GB of storage space when you register your product; plenty of storage for most people's needs. From there you can maintain your personal library of videos and images.Once you get your cameras positioned where you want them it is very easy to see what the camera is transmitting but logging on to their website and choosing the camera of interest. You can only see the output of one camera at a time but switching between them is quite easy. First, you pause the currently selected camera, then click onthe image of the one you want to change to.Taking pictures and videos is extremely easy and is done using the interface that their website provides. They all get stored using the 2GB of space you are allowed on their server. Accessing them is also done on their website and is generally pretty quick and easy. From there you can download to your computer, upload to a site like YouTube, or share videos and images via email. Sharing with email will give recipient the ability to view selected videos or pictures on the vuezone site.You can choose from 2 image resolutions. The first choice is 320x240 which is smaller but allows for a faster frame rate resulting in smoother video playback. The second is 640x480 along with a slower framerate and so the video looks more jerky/stop-motion.Downloading pictures taken using the 640x480 resolution gives pictures that are appx 15kb in size.Pictures taken using the 320x240 resolution picture size is around 5KB.Pictures and videos can be shared (via email or uploaded to a website like youtube) or downloaded as a zip file.30 sec video size: .6MB20 sec video size: .4MB10 sec video at 320x240 resolution size: .1MBThe camera's image can be seen in it's actual size or in full screen mode. As you would expect, the resolution is a bit grainy in full screen but is still quite viewable and acceptable. There is a setting that can be made for each camera that allows you to choose the brightness level. This is very helpful since it allows for bright or very low light applications.Note that no sound is recorded. The cameras do not have a microphone.You can get their Premier Service for an additional charge of $49.95/year. To learn more check out this link:[...]The cameras have a wireless range of up to 300 ft. line of sight  from the gateway. In indoor installations, the range will decrease and be dependent on environmental factors such as metal obstructions, wall and ceiling thickness, and other such obstructions. In general, your VueZone wireless network will have a wireless transmission range similar to an 802.11 wireless device. I found that I could place the cameras anywhere in my house or even front/back yard and they worked just fine.The motion detection can be enabled or disabled. When enabled, the camera records 10 seconds worth of video each time the sensor is triggered. These videos are all stored on the VueZone cloud server; along with all your other pictures and videos. What I found is that if you have 2 (or presumably more) cameras both set for motion detection, that only one can record at a time. As a test, I set them both pointing to the same location, both enabled for motion detection. When I walked into the motion range detection area both cameras sensed my presence. Ten seconds of video was stored for each camera. But, it was not the same ten seconds. The second camera switched on to record when the first one finished; so I got a total of twenty seconds of video.This is a very nice and easy to setup and use system. It is not perfect and I'm sure that improvements will be forthcoming. A couple of changes I would hope for are to be able to plug in the cameras instead of relying on batteries. Also, I would like to have the ability to use the system locally instead of having to rely on their website to view and control the cameras. For now, it is well worth the price and I would recommend it.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vuezone July 2011 Update", "Author": "heybob", "ReviewID": "R25NKGQCQ2BQ1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I first saw Vuezone monitoring system on a relative's iPhone and was fascinated that he could instantly view their lake house thousands of miles away.We have two homes which are subject to bad weather and occasional curious critters prowling about.  I immediately ordered two systems and have added additional cameras and now view the homes several times a day, and have the motion detectors email me whenever there is activity within camera range.  The system installs easily and their web site works flawlessly.Here's what I like:Installation: Plug-in simple.  The wireless control plugs into my wireless router and the battery operated cameras can be placed inside anywhere.  In shopping for other wireless monitoring systems it was difficult to tell how they are configured and what \"wireless\" meant;is there a controller; is it Wi-Fi, etc. These sytems required coordinating my web address among other unpredictable tasks.  Vuezone is very clear and requires no network customization to install.  Choices of services require a click of my mouse.Operation: I view remotely from my PC and my wife's iPad.  My Palm Pre phone doesn't monitor, but is able to view clips if there is an intrusion, all of which is fine with me.  Their web site is clear and has an effective set of controls to optimize the quality of the video, and control what you want to monitor and not.  I like the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the camera so a falling leaf doesn't result in a false motion alarm.Economy: The sytems are fairly priced.  I would expect to subscibe to their plan that supports multiple systems, but that has not been implemented.Here's what would earn that last star:Offer a camera that can be placed outdoors. Also, complete offering the plans they say are available in their ads, like supporting multiple installations on one site and bill. I love the idea they can feed sensors off their wireless controller.  How about adding a temperature sensor to make sure the house stays above freezing?Summary: In protecting our homes through video monitoring this is a valuable product and relaible service that is well designed and executed.  There may be other sytems that offer sound, the ability to pan and dynamically zoom, but they are exponentially more complex to operate in my opinion.

Got mine as an Amazon Lightening Deal for $129 (1 motion, 1 reg). Great price (like half retail, I think) for 2 cameras. It was VERY easy to set up and the Vuezone website viewing was a piece of a cake. Absolutely no problems with any of that. The cameras did occasionally have to be re \"sync'd\" which wouldn't be a problem if you're only using for baby monitor but proved unreliable for me, owing to the other reason for my purchase. How do you re-sync when out of town?Pros: extremely easy to set up; clear, nice live video via Vuezone website and via iphone app; motion detection worked well (emailed me when motion detected and took video that was stored on site).Cons: somewhat unreliable with sync issue (esp if you're not at physical site); iphone app only available with PAID subscription ($50 fiftydollars/year, I think, and this really bites considering other cams have free monitoring apps); no night viewing; no audio (as far as I can tell).In the end I purchased a set of D-Link livecams (DCS-932L) which have IR night view and audio for watching baby at night as well as free iphone and web viewing; they also have motion detection, email alerts, etc. The primary difference is that the Dlinks are IP cams and the vuezone are not. DLinks were moderately easy (I'd say level of difficulty for Vuezone was 1 and for DLink was 3 for basic, 5 for advanced settings).

OTOH, this system is a lot less expensive & you don't need a professional to install it.  Now that we've got that out of the way...I'm pretty computer savvy but struggled for uncountable hours trying to get a Linksys network camera hooked up.  A friend had the Vuezone system & had absolutely no problems setting it up.  So I gave the Linksys away & got the Vuezone package with 1 indoor & 1 motion detector camera.  Setup was a breeze!  Seriously, within 15 minutes of opening the box, the cams were up & running.The cams aren't lovely or small enough to hide easily.  But they are nice looking & not huge.  The fact that they are easily moved can be a double edged sword.  It's nice to be able to move them around easily.  But they can easily be knocked out of position if someone is cleaning the area or bumps into one.  The kit came with two cams & four domes, so you can set up multiple placement domes to be used with the cameras.  Yes, the sticker on the back of the domes say the adhesive may damage paint or drywall, so hang accordingly.  You can also use a nail to hang them.  Hardware is included.We have sunscreens on many of our windows.  You can see well enough through the sunscreens, at least in the daytime.  Haven't tried it at night, yet.  I have posted a photo of the view through a sunscreen.The attached video clip was recorded on my Vuezone system, downloaded & edited to be shorter.I wish Vuezone would add a weatherproof, outdoor camera that could be secured (so no one can simply grab it & walk off).It's very nifty to be able to view the cams from my iPhone, too.  Plus, you can save the videos to your computer to keep forever and/or to free up space in your Vuezone account.  If you download a clip to your computer, it's in a common, non-DRM protected format.  This means you can easily modify the clip, if you have the tools & skill set.The downside is I dislike being locked into a service.  Yes, I know there is the free service, but I think if you want videos, you have to have one of the pay subscriptions.  However, after the struggles I had with trying to get the Linksys up & running, I figured it's probably worth it.I will update this post later, after more experience with the system.Update 9/15/11:  A downside to the iPhone app is that you cannot set the motion detection time to 90 seconds, like you can in the web client.  And, if one of your cams is recording (IE a motion detection cam), you cannot view *any* cams. I did order two more cams - another motion detection one & another \"regular\" one.Update 10/2/11:  From what I can see,  you cannot have multiple cams recording at the same time.  IOW, if you have two motion detection cams focused on the same area but from different angles, only the first one triggered will record.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "MCameraX", "Author": "jaybar", "ReviewID": "RG4MHGYCW1YSY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent system for its purpose, like the motion feature.

I had no problem at all viewing a camera at the other end of my house from the gateway (through several walls), I did have tomove my gateway at least a foot away from my wireless router though.I love that the motion detection is -real- motion detection (works the same way an alarm system would detect motion via IR), most of the so-called detection schemes other netcams use are just an image motion detection algorithm that just isn't reliable, and that won't work at all in low light.Being able to place the small cameras anywhere is really cool.It's great having the iphone app too, it works well.Being able to have video clips recorded offsite when motion is detected is great for security purposes.The only drawbacks are that the frame rate is slower than other netcams (but that's not a real concern for me) and the biggest issue for me is that I cannot use the system from my work location, they did a great job making the gateway able to work without needing to open any ports on the router, but for some strange reason made the viewing web page dependent on how your network is set up,which means I'm unable to view the cameras most of the day, but to their credit, when I contacted their customer service about it, said they would consider trying to fix it.I'd also like to see other notification methods available for when motion is detected (e.g. SMS, instant message, or even an automated phone call...)I can't wait till the outdoor camera is available (hopefully it will have night-vision capability).", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overpriced fraudulent product than requires annual fee to use", "Author": "Gene", "ReviewID": "R1PVGVNTONHTBV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "-the camera itself is garbage.

And each time tech support was able to establish the connection, then saying goodbye, the cameras would disconnect.  and let me point out a few facts.  My internet connection is 35mps verizon fios.  I was doing the entire setup in my office so the cameras were within a few feet of the transmitter that was connected to my fios router.  I spent a total of 3+ hours in 4 different conversations to get the cameras to stay connected and they would not stay connected.  I gave up in the end as there's no reason to buy something like this and it not work out of the box.  and yes, all the batteries were tested and were strong. very disappointed in this system and frankly I don't understand all the positive comments on this hardware. and to think that I didn't even dare move the cameras to the parts of my house I wanted to use them.  very strange indeed. so if anyone wants to buy the system from me, pls contact me at mmgibbons@farinc.com", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very cool device, and AMAZING customer service", "Author": "AdDesigns", "ReviewID": "R36DXL23R475XK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very cool device.
