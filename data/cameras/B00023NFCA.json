Carnahan \"photogfr1\"", "ReviewID": "R1V889K20AD7SA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a professional photographer and have shot Minolta since the advent of the first auto focus, the Model 7000. As the years went by, Cannon and Nikon seemed to kill them with lens selection and features. I still hung in there. I had about $11,000 in lenses alone and was more than a little pleased with the new Maxxum 9 when it came out. What a great camera! However, digital was rapidly becoming king.About the time I decided to chuck it all for a new Cannon digital system, I heard rumors of a Minolta digital. This was previously stated to NEVER happen. Minolta would not build a digital body. Thank God for Konica! Shortly after the purchase of Minolta by Konica, the probability of a digital was rumored. I decided to hold out and am glad I did.The camera is packed with an enormous array of features that can pretty much be found on most upper end Digital's. However, three main things have made me absolutely ecstatic with this camera:1. The image viewing screen is absolutely huge compared to others. I can actually do legitimate critical proofing with this thing. I don't think you could even fit a bigger screen on it without making the camera larger.2. The anti shake body is impressive...very impressive This is not new technology for Minolta. They have had this incorporated into their fixed lens digital for a while now. Bottom line is that it works! I sat it on the hood of a running car with the stabilizer on and then off (300mm 2.8 lens). The two photos were unbelievably different. One was blurred, one wasn't. That simple.3. It shoots the same way my Maxxum 9 does. When I turn it on, it is ready to shoot. No waiting. The buffer size allows me to shoot continuously without missing important photos while waiting for the camera to catch up to me. This is extremely nice and not what I am used to.When I heard of the possibility of this camera being introduced (more than a year before it actually finally hit the market) I purchased an Olympus E20 to get me by for the time. I have been very happy with the Olympus in the studio. However, the screen was too small to proof with and I was always waiting on the camera. It is now my back up. I LOVE this new Minolta and can't wait until they put their 8 meg chip in another model. Perhaps a 9D?Hmm I hope so.At any rate, I am impresed. I will now be purchasing another as my back up.Thank you very much, Konica/Minolta...Finally", "Date": "December 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "Very Good Camera", "Author": "D. Fletcher", "ReviewID": "RH7D8N28Y0FXU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's really a no-brainer if you already have some Minolta AF lenses, but even if you don't have an SLR kit this camera should give you something to consider.  The Canon 20D is a fine choice, too, but although it has a higher resolution sensor I'd rather have the 7D if I were just beginning to put a system together.Why?  The Minolta is a shooter's camera.  The ergonomics are absolutely brilliant.  Near perfect, even.  Plus, the viewfinder is a whole lot better than Canon's or any other body in its range that I know of.  That may not sound like a big deal, but it's very, very nice to have, especially if you do any macro work or need to focus manually for whatever reason.  Everybody needs to see what they're shooting!  I don't know why the other manufacturers don't realize this.  Another great feature of the 7D is the large LCD that automatically orientates itself when you shoot vertically.Then there's Minolta's anti-shake thing.  It really does work as well as advertised, so if you know how to hold the camera you can really bend the rules with low-light shooting.  The flexibility is awesome.  Now, it won't work miracles.  Don't expect it to give you a sharp photo if your subject's moving and you're shooting at 1/4\".  And you'll still want to use a tripod with that 300mm unless it's really bright out.  But, say you have Minolta's great 50mm f1.4 mounted on the camera.  You really can get away with handholding at 1/4\" in a lot of situations (provided, of course, that you have good technique).  That's what AS is for.The 7D isn't quite perfect, though.  Hopefully they've addressed this issue, but a lot of the early 7Ds (mine included) had to be sent back to KM to repair a backfocus problem.  In some cases they had to be sent back more than once (mine included again).  To their credit, KM has great customer service.  They're fast, attentive, and will pay for your shipping if you're unhappy.  They've also been known to give away batteries and such to people who've had trouble with their new 7D.  And it should be said that Minolta isn't the only company who has had problems like this.  Canon had it on their 10D (and may have had it with the 20D for all I know).Other than that, it's hard to find complaints.  When I got mine, it cost a little more than its competition and that kind of hurt when I bought it.  Now that I've had the camera for eight months, though, I can say it was definitely worth it.  I'm very happy with my choice and I wasn't even compelled to go with Minolta because I had a bunch of their glass.  If I had Canon or Nikon glass I probably would've stuck with them...I'm not sure that it's worth several thousand dollars to switch over (unless you have money to throw around).But do keep in mind that this is a long term decision.  I've alluded to the fact that lenses are the real investments in photography, not bodies.  In the long run you'll want to go with a brand that makes the glass you'll want to use.  If you're going to be a pro photographer, it may be best to stick with Canon or Nikon because they offer up a little broader selection of lenses than Minolta.But there's still another way of looking at it.  How often are you going to need something strange like a tilt-shift lens?  They're so expensive and so rarely used it doesn't even make sense for most people to buy one.  You can rent them if you need to, though, and you can also rent the body to go with it.  So I don't know if I'd be too afraid to go with a 7D if that's what I wanted.Anyway, if that review kind of rambled you have my apologies.", "Date": "November 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Minolta's first digital SLR", "Author": "Jay Williams", "ReviewID": "RWR0R1TY2G5D4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D is a digital SLR (DSLR) which is built on Minolta's Maxxum 7 body in terms of buttons, knobs, and layout. In terms of build quality, it is more like the Maxxum 9 professional 35mm film body. It has an APS-size CCD as its image sensor which crops an image by 1.5X in comparison with its 35mm film counterpart. The 7D has a large, high-resolution LCD, matched by only two other DSLRs, as of this writing: the Nikon D2H and D2X, both of which are twice the price of this camera. It has a maximum ISO of 3200, matched by few other cameras. Even the Canon 1Ds has a maximum ISO of only 1250 and the Canon 1D Mark II of only 1600. The 7D has a resolution of 6 mega pixels, which some might find disappointing, given the plethora of new digital cameras which have come out over the past year having a resolution of 8 mega pixels. The big news, of course, is the built-in image stabilization, introduced in the Minolta A-1 prosumer camera. While Canon users, and, more recently and to a lesser degree, Nikon users, have had to choose a lens here and a lens there on which to spend their hard earned cash if they wanted image stabilization, owners of the 7D will pay a fair price for it once and will then gain the benefits of it with every lens in their arsenal; wide, long, macro, or special effect (e.g., soft focus). This is something that was impossible with film. It really is a brilliant idea.Although there are some caveats, this is an excellent digital SLR with great features, handling, and performance.

About 18 months ago I decided to experiment with the world of digital and purchased a Canon Rebel, along with much additional equipment required in the digital darkroom.  After close to $2500 in equipment and supplies and $3000 in wasted lab bills that brought me nothing but \"plastic\" looking prints, I packed it all in a box and sold it to the first person who would take it...vowing never to touch digital again.But recently I kept reading reviews about Minolta's first digital SLR.  With the benefit of being able to use all my existing lens and equipment, I slowing got the bug to try it.I'm thrilled to say that after a brief review of \"where are the buttons\", I shot a few test frames around  the house.  And then added it to my next few portrait sessions (shooting both film and digital).  With some minor light adjustments in studio,my next two shoots went digital...  I may never buy film again.My biggest problem now is ... quit shooting so many frames just because I can!", "Date": "September 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "The photographer's digital SLR! Anti-Shaken, not stirred!", "Author": "W. Arnold \"Writer\"", "ReviewID": "R3P9KBJJ7RD39F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a semi-pro digital SLR that can take pictures of the family at Disney or in your professional studio, this is it. It won't break your budget, and you will be the \"Apple\" user of the DSLR prosumer market. (i.e., secretly envied by Canon and Nikon users, but most won't admit it!).This camera has some real positives over other manufacturer's cameras in the same class. First and foremost, it has 'anti-shake' built into the camera body. For those that don't know, this is similar to the \"steadycam\" technology used on consumer camcorders to help stabilize your shots. There is one big difference between Konica-Minolta's implementation and everyone else's on the market: you get anti-shake built into the body of the Maxxum 7D! What does this mean? It means virtually EVERY lense you buy is now anti-shake! Every other manufacturer makes you buy special lenses that have a similar feature built into the LENSE, not the BODY.YES, it really works to. A convenient little indicator inside the viewfinder tells you just how much anti-shake each shot is needing.Wouldn't it be great to quickly change almost any option on your DSLR camera and get back to shooting pictures without delay? Ever tried to change some feature, only to have to wade through two or three levels of menus on some small LCD? This is not only frustrating, but embarrasing! Imagine your wedding party not having to wait for you to make adjustments or you are at some sports event and the opportunity to take the picture is a one shot deal. No more! The Maxxum 7D has no top LCD. That's right...this is a positive- NO top LCD. Instead, almost every major function can be changed with a knob or button on the top or side of the camera. Yes, this presents a little bit of a learning curve. Yes, I was a little nervous about Konica-Minolta's choice to go this way in the design. I can tell you now, after less than a week of ownership, I love it!In addition, there are hundreds of lenses and accessories available for this camera, the body itself feels solid and comfortable, the 2\" LCD screen on the back is enormous compared to the competition, the camera can save in RAW and JPEG format AT THE SAME TIME, and for a DSLR, it is just plain fun to shoot with.The ONLY drawback I have found is that Konica-Minolta chose 6 megapixels for this model, while some of the competing models are at 8 megapixels. Honestly, if you know photography, the difference between 6 and 8 megapixels is really non-existent to 99% of those who would view your photos. If you are trying to decide between the Canon D20 and the Maxxum 7D for example, the anti-shake feature FAR outweighs any small benefit you could get from the additional megapixels on other models. (This camera's features really should be compared with camera's like the Canon D20, and not the entry level Canon Rebel XT line).One other feature no one seems to have mentioned is the built in Depth of Field Preview button. This is a really convenient feature that allows you to check and see your depth of field before taking the shot. (Depth of field is simply how much of the background is your picture is in focus. For example, a close up portrait might have the background out of focus while a shot of the mountains will have everything in focus).Overall, this camera will meet almost any level photographer's needs. Although the controls have a small learning curve, within less than an hour of shooting you will love them. Whether you have a lot of photography experience, or almost none at all, this is one digital SLR you should really consider.", "Date": "August 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "I can't leave the house without this camera...", "Author": "Matt A. Kurkowski \"Electronic Addict\"", "ReviewID": "RA3T5NZ70M6YW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every day since I purchased this camera three weeks ago I have been outside or somewhere else getting shots of EVERYTHING.  The body design is FLAWLESS; every setting is virutally at your fingertips without having to sort through menus.  Even the menus that are in the camera are a breeze to sort through--they are all full screened, independent menus, you won't have to select a menu category and scroll up and down to find the option you're looking for.  Every essence of design in this camera is done in the name of ease.I purchased a Canon G6 back in January because of the features it offered: 7.1MP and a manually controlable, bright F/2.0 lens.  I had been shooting with a Minolta Maxxum 5 SLR for several years, but being in college, it was difficult to have the money and time to develop pictures, so I turned solely to digital--I was hoping the G6 would be the medium between the two at a moderate, one-time price.  I missed the features of an SLR, but the G6 was more like a point-and-shoot, not the SLR I was seeking.  Then came the 7D, and it has satiated every craving I have had to stifle for the benefits of an SLR.The pictures I have gotten out of this camera are AMAZING.  Friends have asked me where I bought the pictures on my wall, and when I tell them I took them and printed them myself, they are nothing short of amazed.  This is also a fantastic camera to learn SLR photography on.  You don't need to wait to get pictures back from the lab to realize what you were doing wrong--you can see everything clear as day on the 2.5\" LCD.  The autofocus system is out of this world, focusing quickly in even the darkest locations.My only gripe with the camera is the provided software does a lousy job maintaining detail in converting and handling the RAW images.  Use Photoshop's Camera RAW utility, it's much better.  And at times, the images you get out of the camera appear slightly soft, but I like that the camera isn't pushy like some other brands with in-camera sharpening.  If I want a sharper picture, I usually just boost the sharpening effect +1.  Overall, a DEFINITE GOOD BUY.", "Date": "May 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Nikwax", "ReviewID": "R3D1WR67V43LOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for several months, just returned from a trip to Europe where I shot 700 photos, also shot a wedding in the summer which was around 300 photos. I'm very happy with it overall. I've been a photographer for around 40 years, and I'm not too happy with the modern digital SLR cameras with their layers of menus for what I consider vital functions, not to mention the too-small controls. I looked at the Nikon 70s and the Canon 20d, I just didn't connect with them. As soon as I picked up the Minolta, it felt just right. This is a photographer's camera. I love having knobs that I can easily access without resorting to hard-to-read menus. I love the large LCD. The anti-shake works brilliantly, I've taken low light shots that I would not have gotten otherwise. Image noise is quite low unless you go to 1600 ISO or above, and I've had great luck with the noise filters in Photoshp CS.Niggles: the autofocus is not happy in many low light situations, and the meter gets fooled sometimes. These are not unique problems with the Minolta, just wishes for an ideal world. The body is a bit heavy, but personally I like a large camera with some heft to it.Overall, a well thought out camera that was certainly designed by photographers for photographers. I would not recommend this camera for beginners, as it lacks the auto modes that are typically found in entry level cameras, but experienced photographers (particularly old film camera hounds like me) should have a look. It takes wonderful images, which is what photography is about. Don't get sucked into the \"more pixels\" arguement, most of the specs quoted by marketing people are meaningless in the real world.", "Date": "December 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Fits like a glove", "Author": "Mir Islam \"mislam\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZFGIIAOA2GSJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you have had minolta cameras before you will feel right at home with this new maxxum 7D (Dynax in europe). I have been a long time minolta user and was very glad to see this camera finally hitting the market. Just last week I finally got the chance to handle one at a local store. I am sharing my initial impression of the camera.Pros:1) Feels great in hand. I was very comfortable with its ergonomic design.2) The AS (Anti Shake) feature is truly useful. I have been reading posts from canon users as well as minolta 7d users and looks like the AS is coming really handy in low light situation. Canon and Nikon both have similar technology for reducing shake at low light or with high level zoom. However, those technologis are built into the lense. Because of that those lenses are more expensive than the regular lense. BUT Minolta has the AS built into the body. That's why any regular Minolta/maxxum AF lenses can be used and benefit from AS technology. That is the key difference and creates this initial price difference.3) Color is great right out of the camera. No retouching is necessary.4) Large buffer for continuous shooting5) Takse variety of preexisting minolta lensesCons:1) PRICE ! I think the price will scare away several would be amature photographers. Especially since a digital rebel (not as feature rich) can be found less than 1000$.Bottom line. If you already own minolta  lenses this maybe the right camera for you to leap into digital photography. Or else you may want to take a look at digital rebel and see if that fits your bills.", "Date": "November 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "An Excellent Start", "Author": "Tim Todd \"Nivaun\"", "ReviewID": "R3MZOZRB5ACWYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am no novice to photography and have used the Canon EOS 20D, 1DS Mark 2, the Nikon D70s, and D2Hs. So I do have some incredible cameras to compare my Maxxum 7D to. Even though the Maxxum 7D is not in the same league as the Canon 1DS ll or the Nikon D2Hs it does have a lot of features that come very close to these DSLR's at no where near the cost.My introduction to photography began with a Minolta XE-7 back in 1981 and I have been a loyal Minolta user ever since. They continue to quietly push technology. Minolta was the first camera to take pictures on a manned space flight, They were the first to indroduce TTL metering, They were the first to put color corrective coating on lenses, the first to create a body integrated auto-focus system, the first to put Aperature and Shutter Priority modes on a camera, and the list goes on. Now they can add the first Body Integrated Anti-Shake System with the Maxxum 7D.During the past year my Maxxum 7D has held up to shooting dog sled races, and sub-zero backcountry adventures, pounding rain, scorching sun, sand storms, weddings and family snapshots. Yes, there have been a few misfires but not different than any other camera on the market. It's electronic and all electronics hiccup every now and again no matter what company made them. The Nikon I used had to be sent back three times for repair and the Canon 20D had to be sent back twice. I also had to send the Maxxum 7D in once but the repair was the fastest I had seen from a camera manufacturer at 7 days. The reason for sending the Maxxum 7D in was because the auto focus motor would not disengage fully so I could manual focus. The problem was resolved and has worked awesome ever since.I love the nobs. I don't like haveing to run through a LCD menu to change settings like you have to do with Canon and Nikon so the Maxxum 7D suits me perfectly, but this is a personal choice and not of any relevence. I like how logical all the settings are. It can be as simple as you like or as confusing as you want to make it.Is this camera for everyone? Definitly not. I don't believe there is one camera that is capable of producing 100% of creative impulses that flash across my mind. Sometimes only film will work, some shots require medium format, other times just a simple pinhole camera is all I need. One thing I do know for sure is that the Maxxum 7D is one incredible camera with endless capabilities and at a fraction of the cost of $3000+ DSLR's. In fact the Maxxum 7D has bailed me out of many situations when the Nikon D2Hs, Canon 20D and 1DS Mark ll have failed to work properly. At not time has the Minolta ever failed to produce the results I expected. For this reason I give it a five star.Now that the Maxxum 5D has arrived I eagerly await the Maxxum 9D.", "Date": "September 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Minolta did a great job.", "Author": "J. Tay", "ReviewID": "R2PNDRJIHB5S35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ease of using the interface of this camera is beyond any other competitors. Almost all settings can be done with the dials, meaning to say that you don't have to sieve through tons of menus on the LCD to change a setting. The LCD is a big bonus as well. It really makes me wonder why Nikon and Canon can't do the same, it's not technically challenging nor does it increase cost by much. Trust me, you'll love the 7D once you compare it's LCD to the puny ones that others offer. Battery life is adequate as well. Obviously the Anti-shake is an advantage, especially if you have shakey hands to begin with. But take note that it's not a miracle cure, it REDUCES shake, but doesn't ALWAYS eliminate it. So at the end of the day, you still require rather steady hands.A few gripes. Firstly, there's not much lens selection. You can't beat the likes of canon's vast collection. But Minolta is rectifying that, so its not much of a problem. Second, focusing speed is not up to par with the canon 20D nor the nikon D70. If you're the kind who feels strongly about focusing speed, u might just get frustrated with this one.At the end of the day, minolta has designed one splendid camera, with a few shortcomings.

WOW, what a camera. I have moved up from the 7000i to the 7D. I bought the camera in mid Jan and to date have taken over 2000 pictures with it. Probaly 300+, just learning what things did what.I take pictures in 3(primarily) modes. The ability to set the camera in those 3 modes, and switch from one to the other is a tremendous plus to me. Most of my work is at night. Some times with flash, sometimes ambient light. Being able to rotate one dial to change the camera settings makes it easy and fool proof. As long as I remember to do it.Using continous, daylight, I can get a play back that is close to full motion video. From a still camera. I was getting 16-18 shots a second. Thanks to the large buffer.Down side? Well, compared to the 7000i I shot for 10 years or more, this camera is heavy, and though I was able to use my existing lens, thanks to the body mount stabilization, the 5600 flash is very expensive, and necessary for digital photography.Overall, I can't say enough good things about this camera. 8 mega pixel chip?

I have the maxxum 7 film camera that the 7d is based on so the transition was very easy. I like the controls being out in the open instead of settings being buried in menus. It may look like you have to have an engineering degree when you count the buttons and dials (around 25, depending on what you include), but the controls are easy to learn as everything is clearly and logically marked. The anti-shake has been impressive. I have gotten acceptable sharpness from shots taken with a 300mm f4 wide open at 1/30th. Any panning or dragging the shutter seems to have better results with the AS turned off. With a fast memory card (sandisk extreme III) I get around 20 shots continuous before the camera slows to write to the card with a full buffer.

First of all let me say me that I am a diehard dyed in the wool Minolta believer. So, this review won't be so much about what is right but more about things I found that perplexed me or need improvement. I am doing it that way because it has been my experience that most people that already have a top end camera are not looking to switch systems and that KM users reading reviews want to know where the weaknesses exist. I already own a Max9 and HtsiPlus so I was elated to see that the controls were left alone and are much the same as on the Max 9&7. The camera, as with the 9 & 7 is a very intuitive camera. Many people have complained about the weight but after using the 9 for so long the 7D feels like a feather. The big screen is really nice especially for me since I am over 50 and suffer the over 40 eye disease :-). The big screen makes scrolling through options an almost unannoying experience and is certainly easy to find what you want easily. Some of the symbols used in the menu are not very intuitive to me and I find myself hunting for which one to use for what I want to change. But I do appreciate how easy it is to read the screen. At first glance at the viewfinder it appears the camera has eyestart but it does not. Apparently the sensors are there to detect when to turn the screen off if you have it in always on mode. I never really used eystart anyway. The onboard flash seems to be too harsh for subjects within 7 to 10 feet range which is typically the range that a flash works best. I tried using the onboard flash in ADI (without and ADI lens, more on this later), pre-flash ttl, and manual mode. It didn't matter what mode I used, if I didn't dial in flash compensation the flash would be too harsh and if I dialed in compensation there wouldn't be enough flash. I guess the ttl doesn't work. Now for The ADI issue. I don't understand why there is an ADI option in the flash menu? Shouldn't ADI just work intuitively if the lens is ADI? Why do I have to turn it on or off? In fact, I would have loved to see a flash button put on the camera so I don't have to go to the menu to put the flash in manual or pre-flash ttl mode. Instead I'd just push the button then use the control wheel to set the flash mode.Finally, if you purchase the VC-7D grip be warned that the holding strap (HS-1) does not come with the grip like it does with VC-9 grip. You have purchase it as a seperate item at about $21. Speaking of the grip, why doesn't the VC-7D hold two different kinds of batteries at the same time like the VC-9?After I take some pictures I'll be back to tell you what I think.10/22/06 Ok I am back. I have thoroughly enjoyed using this camera. Except for a trip I took to Sanibel Island Florida Ding Darling Refuge in April 06 I have used the Maxxum 7D exclusively. I have found that flash problem I spoke of earlier is caused by the hyperfocal distance of the lens. If you are shooting within 10 feet and not using an ADI capable lens you must have the flash set to TTL. Also, using the 5600hs(D) external flash with a lens 40mm or less you must dial down the flash to -1 or even -2. Battery life is excellent. I have filled up 3 1GB cards without having to change batteries. The anti-shake mechanism works but works much better with lenses of 200mm or better. I still haven't learned the menu system well enough to go straight to the function I wish change without having to think about it quite a bit. There is a neat custom function which allows you to select the center contoller button as the AF instead of using the shutter release button. this allows you to prefocus leaving the shutter release for setting exposure so that you can reframe and shoot without waiting for the lens to refocus.", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best camera I've come to own.", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R3LB0DQ9BMD1DV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the best technology has to offer. I bought my Maxxum 7D at a camera shop along with a 1GB fast read/write card. The lens I purchased with is a Tamron 18-200mm lens, which is excellent by the way. I suggest getting a protective filter with multi-coated UV protection, it's a small investment of $14-$25 for a couple-hundred dollar lens. The camera is excellent, the anti-shake is absolutely incredible. The manual controls give you the feel of a professional photographer. You are not able to use the LCD screen as a viewfinder, it's only for reviewing photos and checking the camera settings. I don't suggest this camera for beginners because of the complexity and price tag on it. Start off with something smaller, maybe a Sony Cybershot or a Fujifilm Finepix S5100.

It was the first DSLR camera to incorporate AS (anti-shake) into the camera body instead of the camera lens. It seems like such an obvious no-brainer it's a wonder why nobody thought of it earlier. With the 7D, any lens you attach to the camera magically becomes AS enabled!That means every lens from a cheap $50 plastic kit lens to a $1,500 pro level telephoto lens. The other big camera brands (Canon and Nikon) put their anti-shake technology (Canon calls it IS, Nikon calls it VR) into their lens. And not all of their lenses have IS/VR. That means if you want anti-shake with Canon and Nikon you need to buy their special IS/VR lenses, and believe me you WILL pay extra for it. Another problem is that Canon and Nikon don't make wide lenses or fast standard primes with IS/VR. With the Maxxum 7D, any lens your heart desires will be AS enabled once you connect it to your camera. Simply awesome! Once you try photography with anti-shake technology, there is no going back!", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera!!", "Author": "C. Cromer", "ReviewID": "R1MRLPZTXDIWJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally converted to digital this month and immediately took it on a two week trip to Italy.  Although the camera has plenty of options and adjustments available, the settings are easy to figure out and the small manual is understandable and is organized in a way to makes it easy to find the explanations needed.  The photo quality is excellent and the anti shake technology really works, even with my  18-200 mm lens.  I carried a spare charged battery since I seemed to use one up before I was finished taking photos.", "Date": "July 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "a camera to get high on.", "Author": "A.

I've had moments when i danced like a kid who just scored a goal after openning up the images on the computer screen!!! This baby reflects every aspect of my personality and helps me bring out my crazy photo ideas. I hesitated and was patiently waiting till i could get it all together with the 28-75mm 2.8 lens, my second best was Nikon's D200, but i decided to follow my dream and i've been happy ever after. Sweet!!! 6MP is just fine with me, printing posters the size of a wall isn't my hobby, so why splash out so much to keep up with the Joneses?! MP count has nothing to do with the quality and a good lens like the one mentioned proves it. The camera is so well designed i barely use the LCD screen, it's on only to review the shot and get some initial settings done, buttons and dials are so intuitively laid out, one doesn't have to take his eye off to make an allignment!!! It's become my arms extention and i now see as if having a viewfinder always on me and the moment i spot something extraordinary i know i can take the challenge - i'm all set for it! Excellent job by KM! I tried Canon 30D in a store before and after the purchase, surely the results are sweet, but it feels like a toy or like an aoutomatic transmission car compared to a well built solid stick shift!

Great built, made in Malaysia.  The camera feels sturdy and fits snuggly in my palms.  I was afraid that this camera will be heavy as heck since on paper Canon touts that their cameras are lighter and more suitable for traveling and such.  I have not carried it on a long trip yet but initial impression on this camera is that while it may be heavier than other cameras, it's still a manageable weight for a 160-pound guy like myself.  This is my first digital SLR camera.  I have shot great photos with a Canon S400 but I feel it's time that I upgrade.  I had wavered between a Canon rebel XT, Canon 20D, and this baby.  Since I have a couple of Minolta lenses already, and supposedly this camera is in the same class as the 20D, this would be a more cost-effective solution without too much sacrifice on image quality.  The stock lens is horrible and feels like a piece of plastic toy.  Don't pay more than $20 for it.  I have a Sigma 28-300mm lens and it works great.  No incompatibility issues.  Great image quality.  Still need more time to read the manual to figure out what all the buttons do but it would be fun.  2.5\" LCD is very clear.", "Date": "December 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "I would give it 10 stars but it is not an option", "Author": "Michael Defreitas \"Meanstreak\"", "ReviewID": "RRBHYLM4VQDHR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a real bargain right now and soon you won't be able to get one.

It was the digital version of the Maxxum 7 film camera.I'm very happy with the pictures it takes, particularly in low light. This is a benefit of the 6mp sensor, which nowadays seems like a low figure, but unless you want to go much larger than 8 by 10 prints, shouldn't be an issue.What I want to warn people about are a couple of problems with the electronics. The 7d has a known problem of first frame black, the shutter doesn't fire the first time it is used, then you turn it off and back on again and it will work.Eventually though it will stop working.The other problem is with the anti-shake mechanism. The camera will refuse to take a picture while the anti-shake lights go off in the view finder, accompanied by a whirring noise.Both these problems can be fixed, normally by Precision Camera. It will cost you though. I was lucky enough to get one that had been fixed, and was still under the warranty from Precision.

We tried to work on getting it fixed because I enjoyed using it so much and had so many lenses and accessories for it but it was going to be very difficult and expensive (not to mention being without a camera for months) to get it fixed. So we finally just gave it up. I miss the grip of the camera, very nicely contoured and felt very secure in my hands, though a little heavier than some of the others, yes I did feel the difference. One of the nicer features was that some of the most important features were controlled by dedicated external buttons rather than being buried in the menu system. Nice to be able to just move those around with a finger or a thumb instead of looking through a menu to locate something.

The salesman was standing next to me the first night I used it at a church reception, when I was trying to make a photo for the newspaper. The salesman (Joe) was also using a Minolta Maxx 7D. The shutter stuck and wouldn't budge. He told me to take out the card and put it in his camera. Then I made the shot I needed with HIS camera and took the new one home. Never could figure out why the shutter stuck that night. Then I took the camera to Charleston last weekend for a conference. Several shots were ruined due to the shutter sticking and refusing to go down. Twice I managed to force the shutter down and two pictures were so blurred the people are unrecognizable. I tried to change the lens on it by placing a Minolta telephoto zoom lens on, one from my Minolta system 9 35 mm. Got the message in the window, \"No lens attached.\" It was perfectly attached and in place! Then I tried to use the larger flash that came with the 35 mm on the shoe. Flash would not work. Many, many shots were lost due to poor timing by this camera. The salesman refuses to give me my money back. I will have to sell it for whatever KEH in Atlanta offers and it is not much. I paid $1,400 for this plus tax out of my social security check. I feel robbed.
