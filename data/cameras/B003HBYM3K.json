Breakfield IV \"Tom Steele\"", "ReviewID": "R2YM80FFY1LOS8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was shopping at a store that was having a moving sale and picked it up at about half price. I am an experienced photographer smd own a Canon 7D and do a lot of \"enthusiast\" shooting and have even had some of my photos published in magazines. I say this not to brag but to point out that I am experienced in digital photography and know my way around digital camera and photography.I have two kids. My 5 year-old son is very into photography and he has a nice Canon point and shoot that is a hand-me-down, my daughter is 4 and she just wants to take pictures of her stuffed animals, dolls and friends. She has a cheap  kid's camera that she likes. It adds sparkles, unicorns  and frames and bows and makes funny faces, etc. she is able to work  that fairly complicated menu system with no problems.So I figured for $25 I would get her a \"grown up camera.\"Wow, what a terrible camera, how does Vivitar even exist and how do they sleep at night knowing they make this stuff?To start off with, it has a resolution of 12mp but it defaults to 3mp!?! Why? Default picture quality is set to Fine, not super fine. Why? Why would you ever set it to less than the best except when in an unusual circumstance like low space on your card? The DEFAULT should be set it to BEST on everything.Annoying, but here is what are the deal breakers...Picture quality is terrible. No matter what, it is terrible. I've tried changing every setting, to no avail.Auto white balance is terrible. You get very orange picture inside, it only takes decent pics outdoors.Here's the worst thing of all. NO MATTER WHAT YOU do, as soon as the camera is turned off - the next time you turn it on, it defaults to NO FLASH.It SHOULD default to AUTO FLASH which would let the camera decide if it is dark and the picture needs a flash.AUTO should be AUTO. But the camera defaults to flash off everytime you turn it on. So if you are a novice (which has to be what this camera is aimed at, no knowledgable camera user would want a camera this cheap) then you have to know how to change the flash setting AND you have to remember to set the flash to AUTO every time you turn it on.It defies all logic. I've never purchased vivitar and I assumed they weren't the best, but I expected decent photos and decent ease of use... I was wrong.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great First Camera", "Author": "Lulu \"Lulu\"", "ReviewID": "R1N820N1E983CC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a great first camera for my 6 year-old.  The price is right and it's a real camera, not one of those kid ones that takes horrible pictures.  The quality of the camera is great (I have borrowed it many times, and I am impressed) and it is quite easy to use.  I would definitely recommend it for others.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003HBYM3K"}}
