It is light and very simply.  The zoom is great.  In rapid/burst shoot the pictures come out clear.  I had cameras before with rapid shoot they come out blurry.  Getting some great photos of my child playing soccer.  The videos come out clear and a distance from the videoed object it still picks up the audio. I would recommend the camera and for the price it is worth it.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "T. Jarvis", "ReviewID": "R3S7DZ1Q1JE8GD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a very nice camera, light weight, takes excellent pictures and has great features. The only thing I dislike; it often displays a message to turn off the camera and turn it on again when first turned on, which it automatically does, but it is kind of annoying and takes time.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Jim Elmer", "ReviewID": "R1BBAA2P0JW5W9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the camera, but I didn't pay attention to the product specs.  This model runs on AA batteries.  I thought it was the step up model that ran on a rechargeable battery pack.  Battery life is very good.  I've shot several hundred pictures on this set without changing.  It just wasn't expected.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for a beginner", "Author": "Alexandra", "ReviewID": "R2OIH348WFCNXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I'm a 17 year old girl and my mother is big into photography, she has one of those huge cameras with the interchangeable lenses. Compared to her intense camera, this camera is fabulous considering that it doesn't have special lenses. It's very easy to use and the pictures come out beautifully. The only thing I'd say I wish was better is the color of the pictures. I wish they were a little more true to the actual surrounds. But that just means I have to change the settings a little bit (which I'm not very good at). Overall, great camera!!", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA", "Author": "DAVE HEARD", "ReviewID": "R3NU28IUEX02PG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic with out a doubt makes some of the best products on the market.

Save up around $500 and buy an SLR with interchangeable lenses. A Canon would be a good choice.Purchasing this was false economy - and this model has since been superseded by a DMC-LZ30 (bigger zoom), but the pricing unrealistically close to the cost of superior equipment. As the father of a friend of mine used to say, \"You're not rich enough to but cheap\".I returned mine, and would not recommend it to anyone but my enemies. It is fitted with a Leica lens, but that's a lot like installing racing slicks on a Yugo..Move along, now..", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just didn't like this camera.", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R10GWHIBR7YVTP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I returned this within an hour of receiving it. First of all it seemed fragile, maybe my imagination but that's how it felt to me. I put my own batteries and SD card in it and took some test pictures. There was nothing particularly wrong with them, but they were no better than my simple Nikon AW100. Focus seemed questionable to me also, especially for macro stuff.Cost me 6.30 return shipping, but just not the right camera for me.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$249.99", "Features": "Powerful 21x Optical Zoom with 16.1-megapixel Full-resolution\n25mm Ultra Wide-angle Lens\nLarge, 3.0-inch, 460K-dot LCD with 100% Field of View\n720p HD Video Recording", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ20K 16 MP Digital Camera with 21x Opitcal Zoom and 3-inch LCD - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31jVrR4zkVL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008MD3RE8"}}
