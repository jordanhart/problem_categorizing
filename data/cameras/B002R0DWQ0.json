{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great customer service", "Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "R2QXTITIOQ065W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I got this security system to protect our home, workshop and barn.  Packaging was good, instruction manual and quick start guide were easy to use.  Everything we needed to install was in the box including mounting brackets, screws, mouse, remote control, etc.- which I appreciate.  We had no problem getting the cameras up and running and viewing them on my computer.  Picture is really clear-color by day and black and white on the night vision mode.  It works by motion detection so hard drive space lasts a long time and it automatically records over when full-30 days and counting of space so far.  I had some questions about viewing it on my iPhone so I called Swann Customer service (1-800-627-2799) and  I gave her permission to use logmein and take over my desktop and she set up the whole thing remotely while I sat back and watched-cool!  Really nice people at Swann California office.  I called once after hours to ask about viewing my security system with a Blackberry (yes you can)-and I got to speak with someone at their home office in Australia-they were very cool.  Overall very good product and great customer service. I'm ordering another one to put up at my mother's house to help her feel more secure in her home. We saved more than enough installing our own system myself to pay for hers.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "BEST BUY", "Author": "ANDREW F", "ReviewID": "R13EMNVG00IX0E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "RESEARCHED MANY SYSTEMS BEFORE BUYING.

I probably couldve called tech support and got it really quick, but I like to figure it out myself, and I did.the app. in the itunes store that they recommend did not work however, but not a big deal, I eventually found an app from another company that works great with the system.  I can't watch the cameras from my phone unless i'm connected to my home network, but I think I just need to spend some more time figuring it out.also, it's a nice feature to be able to set the motion detection so that a moving tree branch won't set off the record feature, but it's really touchy, even on the lowest setting, and the system ends up recording even the most minor of movements, but again, probably some tweaking needed on my part.overall, pretty good system.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poorly written manual, Horrible support", "Author": "R. Lee", "ReviewID": "R29BYKJJZEQULN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought two weeks ago and installed by myself. Good quality for the price. However, the manual was a joke. Couldn't figure out how to setup detail functions/menus by just reading the manual. And when called the support, had to wait at least 30 minutes every time to talk to anyone. If you're willing to go thru agonizing waiting to get support, as you wouldn't be able to program it only with the manual, and if the most important buying decision criterion is the price, you might want to try it. Otherwise, suggest looking for another brand.  Would not recommend it!", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrrible Customer Service", "Author": "Matt Holmes", "ReviewID": "R162QXJSE4QQDV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought the system, had it professionally installed and the DVR was not functioning properly. Called Swann (good luck talking to a person in less than 30 minutes of holding) and they tried to trouble shoot over the phone. Agreed it was a bad DVR and said that customer service would contact me to schedule a pick up. They never called back...so guess what, I got to call again and wait again forever, then the person couldn't help me with what I needed cause customer support does not open til noon eastern time. Ridiculous service!!!
