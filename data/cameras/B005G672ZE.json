{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far, so good.", "Author": "Mrs. Rollie", "ReviewID": "R3D6SXK4A6XG9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this a few months ago, but when it first came, I did little more than to hook up the cameras, and make sure they all worked.  I must say that at this price point, the video quality looks a lot better than I expected it to.  One could easily identify a person from this footage, if it ever became necessary to do so.  The video looks better than the security cameras we have at my place of work, which is undoubtedly a more expensive setup than this.  I found this system easy to set up and pretty self explanatory.  The menu is simple and easy to navigate.  The DVR unit is compact and not too big or clunky.I had to purchase microphones to also run audio, so I had to buy different cables than the ones included here.  The BNC video cables that came with the system worked fine, otherwise.  They are thin, but seemed adequate.  I didn't notice any \"noise\" or interference with them.  I haven't tried to backup a clip yet, or set it up for remote viewing from the internet.  If I do have problems I will check back and mention them.All in all, this system's picture surpised me for the price.  The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of five is because when the cameras switch from night to day, it seems that the color is out of whack, almost like the IR lights are still on.  (Blues appear a weird green and so forth)  I am hoping that as I play with it more, this can also be tweaked somehow in the settings*Updated:  There is a way to adjust cameras, so I'm giving a star back.  Backup was easy, however, the manual clearly states to use the bottom USB port for backup.  On mine, it actually was the TOP port that had to be used, I found this out through trial and error.  Also, for converting the video file from a h 264 to something more widely used (AVI), you'll have to install the small, unmarked disk that comes with, onto your computer.  This was less than clear, and caused me a little anguish until figuring it out.  I still haven't hooked up to internet, but I am still loving this little unit.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "System would not back-up stored files", "Author": "schark", "ReviewID": "RIO3R65MB9F2G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I installed the system.  It was very easy. The installation was plug and play.  Set-up was a breeze.  The system is very user friendly and it is easy to navigate throughout.  My only problem was that the back-up feature did not work.  The DVR would not recognize the USP device (thumb drive) needed for back-up.  The thumb drive is also difficult to install due to the location of the port.  I discussed this with the tech service people at the source store.  They are repairing/replacing the DVR and securing the stored data.  They are covering all costs.  I have to note here that the cameras do not support all the feature of the DVR  (pan and zoom).  Other than that issue the item is easy to install and works as described.  Based on the above information I am OK with the sytstem as the price was right and the issue is being fixed.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for price", "Author": "Terence McConlogue", "ReviewID": "RAXREVQ6F8X3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are better units on the market but then you will pay almost five times as much as this one.

There is also slight barrel distortion at the edge of the image. The installation is simple enough and the DVR functions OK.

I did have a bit of trouble connecting to the unit with my smartphone but after a call to the company I received detailed instructions within 5 minutes on how to setup the remote access and had it up and running in less than 30 minutes.  You do have to be familiar with networking to setup services and ports on your router.I purchased this for our office to use in conjunction with our security system.  I live 30 miles from the office and now if I get a call from the security company I can use my smartphone to check the 4 cameras to see if there is a problem at the office and rearm the security system it its a false alarm.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "work very well", "Author": "Norman", "ReviewID": "RBAZGXSXFA7OJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "a good price for an excellent team, the videos very tastefully designed, clear, the recorder excellent, I am very happy for my purchase", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "tony", "ReviewID": "R1H4UU85SW0QKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this system works great, you just need to know how to set it up. picture qulaity is not the best but it s good", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for home surveillance.", "Author": "moveintime", "ReviewID": "R32XL38VFAEW1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This DVR was easy to set up, and the camera quality is surprisingly good (I didn't expect them to be that great).  The cameras are heavier than expected and seem pretty durable.  It is a wired system, so installing cameras takes a bit longer, but they have been working well so far.  I use this for home surveillance and so far have no complaints.  I did have to contact customer service once because of an error I made with resolution, but they were very helpful and quick to respond to my email.  For what you pay, this system is great.  I didn't have to read the manual much to figure out playback and backup.  I haven't connected to the router yet, but I would expect that to go well, considering the ease of use so far.The cameras switch automatically to night mode when it gets dark, and if you have them pointing out a window, you won't get much of a picture, if any.

One of the cameras was not working properly, I called CIB they helped me troubleshoot, great customer service.  I returned the camera for a new one which is working great.  I like the look of the cameras, they are small/compact.  Before buying this system, I looked at comparable brands like Zmoto,  Defender 600 TVL.  For marginally better cameras I was not willing to pay another 200 bucks, since I figure in 5 years HD cameras will be much cheaper.  For basic home security this system fits my needs.The Camera Quality:  The camera quality is about what I was expecting for the price. You can recognize faces probably 15-20 feet away. Dont expect to read license plates, I think you need 1080 HD cameras for that which run over a grand.  I installed all the cameras on the ground level of my two story house because installing on a 2nd story aiming down would be a stretch for quality. I do like how the cameras are small compact, and I was able to mount them discretely.  The night vision is better than I expected, the cameras to better at night with a little lighting like porch lights rather than pitch black.  I set one up right behind a light and the glare did not effect quality.  At night they have a subdued red glow.The installation:  Easy installation the tricky part is thinking about how to hide wires, best places for cameras and where to put the DVR box so the 65 foot cables can reach your desired location.  I choose to store DVR under stairs, run two cameras through the garage by drilling a hole from under stairs to the garage, and two cameras down the crawlspace by drilling a hole down into the crawl space and running wires. I am not impressed with the mounting brackets, because one of mine is exposed to rain and i can already see a bit of rust only being there for a week.  But the cameras are easy to mount and adjust. I used  a staple gun for the wiring calked the holes drilled after running the wires and will paint over wires eventually.The DVR:  The DVR is easy to use and figure out the features.  I have not had success with the motion detection yet, but I probably have to play around with the sensitivities on it there is a 1-4 scale.  It is nice that you can adjust the cameras, lightness/darkness, contrast, etc from the DVR box.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "PROMPT DELIVERY, EXCELLENT PRODUCT", "Author": "Thirsty", "ReviewID": "RZP5KC9JHH5UL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As always, delivery was prompt, price was right, and service was excellent.
