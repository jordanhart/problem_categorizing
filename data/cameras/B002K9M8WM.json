{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "DLE", "ReviewID": "R3E8PMQ8OYPSNF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera about 3 months ago at Walgreens (it was much cheaper there than here). It has good features and takes good photos and video (if you don't shake a lot). The only thing I don't like about it is there is no viewfinder. Also, I have dropped it a couple of times, while it was off, and it still works okay - so don't worry if you drop it once or twice while it's off on a wooden floor.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodal C180", "Author": "Laura J.

The display washes out in sunlight and you have to guess at framing and focusing your picture.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Digital Camera Ever", "Author": "Rhonda Goodman", "ReviewID": "R18GIRLDZB9OBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Back in December 2010, I bought the Kodak Easyshare C180 Digital Camera from Walgreens for $59.00 (It was a Christmas Sale). This camera takes good pictures and records good videos. The Kodak Easyshare C180 Digital Camera have the optical zoom and you can record videos up to 21 minutes. The Kodak AA batteries that came with the camera only lasted 5 or 10 minutes. The best batteries to used for the camera is Energizer Ulitmate AA batteries. They last 9 times longer. You got to really stock up on the Energizer Ultimate AA batteries.The first digital camera I had was a Polaroid a530 Digital Camera back in 2009. In 2010, the Polaroid Digital Camera had fell and dropped to the floor so hard (ceramic tile) that it had cracked the screen and broke. The Polaroid Digital Camera didn't have the optical zoom; only the digital zoom. Sometimes the pictures would come out blurred or very dark. And you can only record videos up to 1 minutes. The Kodak Easyshare C180 Digital Camera is better than the Polaroid a530 Digital Camera. I highly recommend the Kodak Easyshare C180 Digital Camera is the best one to buy.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "superv adfordable camera", "Author": "Eflores", "ReviewID": "R14JKNTAYYKH18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "exelent camera for pictures, have been using it for more than 2 years and still working as new, what I dont like is the video quality prefer to buy a video cam.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002K9M8WM"}}
