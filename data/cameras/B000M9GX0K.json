This little camera does it all. I comparison shopped for several weeks comparing and contrasting multiple cameras from cannon, kodak, hp, sony, panasonic, and olympus, and none had features like this, a small size, and in this price range. The upgrades form the old 710 are a 5x optical zoom and 5.6 digital zoom (28x total) for up close, excellent photos, and the dual image stabilization. This upgrades even more from the october introduction of the 750's because of increase number of lenses for sharper photo (8 lenses, 4 groups 4 asperical, up from 6 and 3) and a faster shutter speed to 1/2000 second (from 1/1000 second) for better action.  Nice additions7.1megapixels, Dual image stabilization (both digital and optical stabilization for shake free pictures new for the 750 and 760 models), 2.5 inch lcd viewing screen, and a low price what you get. OH, DID I MENTION EXCELLENT PICTURES. I have played with this for several days now editing the photos, paling with the on-board and the computer imaging package, and I see nothing wrong with this camera for an everyday average user like me. And with it's weather resistence, nice for a clumsy average user like me. Also the battery life is very adequate, about 120 photos or more, with slide shows, editing ect... This is well worth the investment, saving your families memories in a fit and proper manner.The Olympus Master software for you computer is very easy to use, And with panoramic feature, 3d, and Extra ART Features unlocked by Olympus Brand-Olympus Stamped Type H HD, this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own. you can edit photos on the computer, or right in the palm of your hand. Both ways, this camera will make you feel like a pro in no time.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Video is limited to 10 seconds - major limitation", "Author": "Todd E. Bryant", "ReviewID": "RG0OW6RIJJOYE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned numerous Olympus cameras, and our family uses them to take photos and videos for family DVDs.  Being able to take 640x480 video at 30 fps is the main feature I'm looking for.The specifications said the camera takes 640x480/30fps video, but you have to read the fine print in the instruction manual to see that 640x480 video is capped at 10 seconds.  It's difficult to make much use of a 10 second video!Previous Olympus cameras limited video length only if you didn't have a Type H memory card, but this camera limits video even with a Type H card.  The video format has also changed from Quicktime to AVI - perhaps these movies are too large for the speed of the memory card.Anyway, a 10 second video limit basically makes the camera useless for me, and anyone trying to capture useful video.  I feel a little ripped off, because I made my decision specifically on the 640x480/30fps video feature.", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not so exciting as it looks.", "Author": "Sudhindra Chada \"sudhi.\"", "ReviewID": "R1UT46OX3FQ1F6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First things first... This camera truly has all the features that were advertised... the dual-image stabilization... the shadow adjestment technology... all these work very well... This one slips so comfortably into pocket that sometimes you forget that you carrying a cam.

Cannot see the subject in the LCD screen in bright light and is totally worthless outdoors. (Olympus says to change the screen contrast. No measureable improvement.)2) Battery does not last long, especially if using the flash much.3) No 12V auto charger available.4) Exposure button pressure is too high increasing rate of shake, blur and out of focus.5) The price of the camera has dropped 50% in less than 4 months. Is this a testament to poor customer satisfaction?Sadly, the bad points outweigh some really fantastic features, e.g., 7.1 megapixels, 5X optical zoom, size, weight, etc.It's a bummer to have purchased a lemon.

The camera is great. Good optics, weather resistant, fits in a pocket - and Olympus sells underwater cases pressure rated to 40 meters for most of its point & shoot cameras at reasonable prices.The problem I have with this used unit is there is obviously a short. If you you leave the battery in the camera it will be dead in a day or so. I purchased a new battery and it has the same behavior - but only in this unit and not my wife's identical model camera If this was my only or even my primary camera, I'd be ticked about having to store the battery outside the camera between uses.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Look for another product", "Author": "S.

I bought it for the water resistancy, which is about the only good thing besides the size.  The LCD is impossible to see in bright light.  The icons on the buttons are wearing off already.  In very bright light, there is often a white circle near the center of the photograph. I have a 2G card and shoot at high res.  At this setting, I get 1163 photos.  When I get to about 700 images, I get card error messages.  Once I download the photos and re format the card, it was fine. I have used an Olympus C3000 for a long time. An excellent camera, just too bulky.

The pictures are clear, the zoom capability is a real advantage over the normal 3X optical zoom, and the closeups are awesome.  Took pictures in the near-dark of historic potato houses and it brought these musty rooms to life.  I could see in the picture what my eyes couldn't see, without glare or unnatural looking light.  I put the case on my belt, let the sweater hang over and can draw it out like a pistol.  So different from the SLR days when tourist was written all over me.  Also my blow-ups have been very clear, at least to 11x14.  The only problem is the wash-out on the screen in a bright, sunny day.  I learned to compensate for that by holding the camera away from my body and aiming under those conditions.  Works about 80% of the time.  One usually tries to avoid the sun anyway", "Date": "December 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Pics, Bad Video", "Author": "CA-SATX \"CLA\"", "ReviewID": "R1LGY564YNXW3Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after doing a lot of comparison shopping. I find the camera to be just fine although nothing spectacular. The pics are good but not great. The scene guide is great for an amature like me. The dual-image stabilization seems to work very well. I am often outdoors when I use this camera so the all-weather nature of this camera is great.  The LCD screen is quite nice and big but is worthless in bright light. Attempting to use the panorama mode (if you can find it) is hard and Olympus doesn't publish any information that I have found on how to actually use their software to link images. The image is not clear, washed out, and just plain poor. Another problem is that the video is absolutely terrible. The videos are hazy, blurry, washed out. Pity. My cell phone takes much better videos and it's 2 years old. Anyway, overall, I would not recommend this camera.UPDATE:  I've used this camera for many months now and and ready to throw it in the bin. What a piece of junk. The movies mode is absolutely horrible. The videos are next to useless and the audio cuts out. Additionally, panaorama mode is nowhere to be found, even when using Olympus xD cards of which I have 2.

Also in the HQ 30 fps movie mode, the maximum duration of the movie the camera can capture is only 10 seconds. I thought that this limitation has gone in the past (in deed some old models overcome it), and the new Olympus model is not affected with it. Also trying to solve this problem by myself, because the Olympus technical assistance took 10 days to answer an e-mail confirming the camera limitation (Ticket #2132043), I bought a 1Gb type H XD Olympus memory to try if the movies can be longer, but it was the same.Sorry but I will not recommend this camera to my friends.", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Review this Olympus Stylus", "Author": "Mildred M.
