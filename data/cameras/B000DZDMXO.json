I have only replaced the batteries one time, so don't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for.  small lightweight, many features.  choice of 6 meg, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 meg photos at fingertips.  What I really decided on this camera for was the MACRO capability as I take photos of very small coins, and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that.  It preforms magnificantly.  My previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle.  I love the Samsung digimax S600.", "Date": "March 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Battery Killer", "Author": "A. Ravindran", "ReviewID": "R2ROR3R8YHJCAH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought Samsung Digimax S600 6.0 MP, the battery consumption is tooooo much. To take about 50 pictures I had to change the Duracell batteries twice. With rechargable cells (ofcourse the energizer ones meant for digital camera) the max you can take is 20-25 pictures, So if you plan to use this Camera for any important occasion be prepared to carry atleast 3 sets of batteries. It is really frustrating when the battery goes off.The zoom is also not good, better to pay additional 50$ to get a sony or a canon with 4 MP and 5X optical zoom.", "Date": "January 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "V.

The large LCD screen on the back is very crisp and nice.BUT it is a battery hog, probably because it has no view finder and no way to turn off the huge . You must invest in the premium ilthium photo batteries.  The regular Duracells / Energizers will be gone after just 8 photos.  I recently took this camera on a safari to Africa. I took about 200 photos and -- I am not kidding -- ended up going through 28 batteries!  (couldn't get the more expensive photo kind in Kenya)...Also, I am not much of a photographer, but I have gotten much better quality photos (more crisp, better colors) from other point-and-click cameras such as the Kodak EasyShare or Canon Doubleshot.Also, this is one of those annoying cameras that has about a 2 second delay between when you press the button and when it actually snaps, due to multiple layers of red-eye flickering.

I believe there is a flaw in the battery power sensor; it will shut down due to low battery, but if you test the battery later it will show 80% charged.Another big issue: usually each time I use it, the camera will just shut off while i'm about to snap a picture (with the lens still extended). This isn't auto-shutoff, since it does it as i'm actively zooming and setting up the shot.

I purchased a battery charger and 4 rechargeable batteries. This was an additional expense but I came to terms with it, soon.The camera itself has been nothing short of great. I started out as a beginner and took some pretty decent photos. At an amateur level now, I can safely say this camera has a few good settings that allow you to take good quality pictures. Even on 'Auto' mode, try toggling with/without flash and the macro mode and it gives you nice results. I've had this camera for 2.5+ years and haven't felt the need to buy a new one.

I think those reviewers haven't used the camera all that long before reviewing, because seriously it is a problem worthy of some serious star reduction.I've had the Camera over a year and it's been used alot. I had to invest in the NiNmh rechargeable batteries for it's use but still I find the battery drainage unacceptable. You don't realize how inconvenient this problem is until you're buying your second overpriced package of batteries at an amusement park or zoo because you forgot to pack the Costco size pack of AA batteries with the camera.And even at home those batteries take a while to charge- who wants to wait a few hours to take a picture of birthday cake? I can't count the times I've taken 1-2 pictures and then have to pause the activity to stop, get new batteries out and change the batteries- \"happy birthday to you.. happy birthday.. oh wait, everyone, I need new batteries, give me a minute..\"Another frustration is the Shutter lag time, particularly in flash and red eye reduction mode. It takes several seconds for the picture to be taken, then another 9-10 seconds for the flash to recharge. It seems FOREVER and a day when you're trying to get a child to smile on Santa's lap and then you miss the shot by 2 seconds. It will then take a minimum of 12 seconds for the next picture to take. Frustrating.Other quirks that I have noticed- when the camera thinks the batteries are too low, the zoom lens remains out, and does not retract. It also does the \"low battery warning\" and shuts off randomly. I thought it was because I primarily use rechargeable batteries, but have also found to to happen with Alkaline batteries- it beeps the warning and shuts off, then you power it back up a minute later and it says you have 75% power remaining. At that point, you might get 2 more pictures and then you might was well just change the batteries... so it goes back to the battery issue, again.", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good (cost-benefit)!", "Author": "Julio Viana", "ReviewID": "RS5KVVF9UBFQL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The cam is good and cheap.

I wanted a camera with high MP and zoom capability, video with sound was a must, and the price had to be low! I love the picture quality, I have never taken a picture that I didn't like, although the picture will be fuzzy if you move or have a shaky hand (I still like those ones anyway. Artsy, no?). The rotary knob selection is awesome! The interface is very user friendly, even my stone age parents were able to navigate this camera (trust me, that's an amazing feat!). So, I will give it to them when I upgrade. The video feature is awesome, I used it to document my life and paste it on myspace, but the microphone is located right where you would place your left pointer finger when holding the camera - so keep your finger off it when filming or else your sound will get messed up! As Adam said, sometimes the battery beep likes to play tricks on you! It has happened to me three times and it can be very frustrating!! Especially with an impromptu shot!  I always carry extra batteries and I only use rechargeable batteries (I buy the cheaper ones), they're a little pricy but they save you SO MUCH MONEY! I have never had any other problems with this camera. This camera is definitely not for the pros, it's for every day use and people who don't know how amazing a picture can be or don't want to pay for a camera with that kind of capability. I threw a silicone skin on it, tossed it, dropped it, and shoved it in every pocket, purse and backpack that I have ...It was my little buddy for a year and I loved it!P.S.

As for battery use, I read the reveiws on this and at the same time bought a charger and batterys, so the usage has been o.k., but like I said Iam not a heavey user of photos.
