It is easy to operate. very light weight so you can take it with you everywhere. I have a few other cameras (DSLR) but find that most of the time I really do'nt want to lug around a big camera. So having a small camera makes it easy to take it along. I love this camera.The only thing I would like is that the battery would last longer and they are hard to find.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Tricia982", "ReviewID": "R13T9N4NJLBL4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera dispite the negative reviews and I've decided that those who gave this a poor rating never bothered to open the booklet that came with the camera to learn the different settings.

I liked the specs of this camera, which made me buy. I waited for 7 days to get this delivered.After that I charged the battery & installed the s/w from CD came with. Registration process never detect the camera connected to computer. The software is very dirty & many non-required stuff.Next, I took many snaps in all possible angles & lights, and all snaps were horribly blurred for 14 megapixel camera. I compared these pictures with old canon 12 mp camera, and I could see the difference in smoothness & picture quality. Very very poor blurry pictures.I don't recommend this camera to anyone. This is not even kid tool. Iphone 4 mp camera takes better pictures than this one.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Rita", "Author": "Rita Cunningham", "ReviewID": "R25NGVX20MWYXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is my first digital camera and so far, so good.  It is so nice to see the pics right away and then be able to discard them if they are not meeting expectations.  It is the right size (fits into a shirt pocket) and light weight.  Downfall: full directions did not come with the camera so I had to order them separately--making the camera cost an additional $10 but I had no choice because, like I said, it was my first experience using a digital camera.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really, really bad camera.", "Author": "Sydney", "ReviewID": "R2WQWLULNX30ZW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after losing my Canon and not wanting to pay a lot for a new camera.  It is an Olympus so I thought it would be fine for snapshots, as that is all I wanted it for.Turns out, I can't get this camera to take a decent picture on ANY setting, not even in sunlight.  And trust me, I have tried every setting.  Every image is grainy or blurry.I've bought hundreds of items from Amazon and have never left a bad review.  This camera is the exception.  I actually let my 2-year old daughter have it, for it is completely worthless of even snapping pictures of items to sell on ebay.Save yourself the frustration and money.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus 4020", "Author": "lemayrenee", "ReviewID": "R8RIQ81HVM0EN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a full Nikon digital camera system that I use when I go out to take pictures. However I don't go anywhere without this camera in my pocket. I use this camera too when I take photos. I have to admit there are many times something comes up I want to take a pix of when I don't have my Nikon SYSTEM with me - I get the shot with this camera since it's always in my pocket. This is actually a new camera for me, after sever years of hard use I broke the viewing area on my old Olympus, the camera still works I just can't see what I am going to take a picture of. I liked having this Olympus enough I purchased this one as a replacement.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "80th Birthday present for my Mom~ she loves it!", "Author": "CynthiaLuRN", "ReviewID": "R3D76C2JLJLVMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "80th Birthday present for my Mom~ she loves it!Easy to use & she loves taking as many photos as she wants, then reviewing & erasing later:)So pleased to watch her embrace new technology.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Entry Level Camera", "Author": "Gloria E.
