{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Oh Canon, what have you done???", "Author": "S. Scott", "ReviewID": "R3DZ25EL9OLP3T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I am a huge Canon fan boy. I brag about Canon like people brag about Apple or a Toyota Prius. I own two Canon DSLRs (5D and 40D) and several Canon point and shoots (including the S90 and SD800IS) and always recommend Canon to anyone buying a digital camera.I bought this camera for my wife to upgrade her SD800IS and chose it because of the large screen, big zoom, and HD video capability (all great features). After four days of shooting, I returned it. Read on ...The good.Photos in bright light = 5 stars (normal great Canon photos like you would expect). The photos in brighter light were all fairly good and the screen is large and looks great.Zoom = 5 stars. The camera zooms in/out REALLY fast which is great when you're trying to take pics of action shots or something that's moving fairly quickly. Loved having the big zoom.The not so good.Photos in low light (automatic mode) = 1 star. If the distance of your subject is more than about three feet, the camera would switch to shooting at 1/16th (bad) of a second and closer than three feet would shoot at 1/60th of a second (good). So when photographing my kids, that move frequently, many of the shots would blur because the shutter speed at 1/16th was just too slow. When I switched to program (manual) mode and put the flash to ON instead of to AUTO the camera switched back to 1/60 and the shots are fine but for an automatic user, this is awful when shooting subjects in the three to six feet range where the flash is still significant.Screen = 2 stars. While the screen is very large, I think it's using a resistive display which is what the original touch smart phones used (now all using capacitive). This requires much more pressure when touching the screen than say and iphone or android phone. The touch interface itself is also fairly clumsy and needs some work when navigating the menus. One nice feature is the ability to touch the screen anywhere in order focus to that point of the frame (like an iphone does which is great) but by holding that point a bit longer, it also fires the shot and takes the picture which caused quite a few accidental shots (not so great). Similarly, to take videos, you also press the video icon on the screen so if you have the camera in your lap (which we did at one point) you may end up taking a bunch of accidental videos of your lap (which we did several times).Battery = 1 star. I took the camera to Disneyland for the day and the battery lasted from about 8AM to about 3PM, that's all (compared to my 800IS that would last literally and entire trip). The battery itself is shaped like a tube and is smaller than a chapstick container. Not sure why they went with such a small battery when they have that big screen to power.Video = 1 star. The video was the actual deal break for me and caused me to return the camera. While the videos looked great, the sound was horrible. In one video, all you can hear is background noise and not the people that are talking that are only several feet from the camera. The camera also lets you zoom in/out when shooting video which is awesome; however, when zooming while videoing, you can hear the buzz of the lens moving in/out which is horrible. With all my other Canon cameras, I've never had any of these video issues.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works for me", "Author": "Harry", "ReviewID": "R2U0L7XW2CXS39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camer for about a week and so far, it has met or exceeded all of my expectations.  I bought it as an upgrade from a Canon PowerShot A710 IS that I have had for years and which has served me very well.  I bought the ELPH 510 HS primarily for the longer zoom and the more compact size.  The extra megapixels were not a big factor for me.  I have been experimenting with the camera and exploring the features and capabilities.  I have read the reviews and the complaints about short battery life.  The camera comes with a relatively low power battery (870mAh).  I was able to burn through that in an afternoon of playing with the camera, taking and viewing shots, video, etc. and hardly turning off the power at all.  I bought a pair of 1200mAh batteries for spares.  They provide almost 50% more power which should translate to more photos and video between charges.I am totally satisfied with the camera.  It is not a full size digital SLR, which I also considered.  But, I wanted a camera that I could keep with me that would give me more flexibility and better pictures than my smart phone.  While I am certain the full size camera would provide even more capabilities, it wouldn't do me any good if it was inconvenient to carry along.  This camera provides all of the essential, and many not so essential, features that I wanted.  It takes great pictures in nearly all lighting conditions.  The AUTO mode works pretty well for most shots.  I did, however, find that using some of the other scene modes can make a difference, i.e. using Kids & Pets mode when shooting pictures of the grandkids seems to speed up the focus process and results in a better picture. The video is outstanding, especially for the compact size of the camera.  I have read reviews claiming that you could hear noise from the zoom while shooting video.  I have not noticed that to be a problem.I like the touch screen.  It does take more pressure than my smart phone, but it is not problematic.  The menus are intelligently constructed and make it quick and easy to find what you need.  I love the way the switches work for powering on the camera, switching between shooting and viewing, and between snapshots and video.  The camera is always ready to do whatever you want.  The power on time is faster than my previous camera.  It is also faster between shots.  So, I have no complaints.The video diary feature is quite nice, but is limited to low resolution video. The same is true for some of the other rapid shooting features, like the five shot group where the camera picks the best shot, or the 8 shot burst, or the continuous shooting.  These features work well, but do not produce HD size images.  These are the only features of the camera that have not lived up to my hopes.I also did an accidental drop test on the camera.  I had it in my shirt pocket.  I dropped something else and when I bent down to pick up what I had dropped, the camera fell out of my shirt pocket onto a tile floor.  It powered on just fine and everything seemed to work just fine, but it seemed like it took the image stabilization a little while to reorient itself.  It has been working flawlessly since.One feature that I was looking forward to was the ability to control the camera from the TV remote when connected via an HDMI cable.  That does not work with my TV even though it has an HDMI CEC capability.  The camera user guide warns that this could be the case. So, I have to hold the camera and manually control it when sharing photos and video with the camera connected to the TV.  The full HD video is great.  No need to carry a separate video camera anymore.The bottom line -- This is a very capable, very compact camera that takes very good photos and video.  I am completely satisfied and would recommend it.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "On the fence still...", "Author": "MKinz \"Mindi\"", "ReviewID": "R23MEGJI9UX0AS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, let me say I purchased the Powershot 510 and the Powershot 310.  The 510 is a much more solid camera and a lot less plastic than the 310.  I think my two largest complaints and frustration comes with the touch screen and the 12 power zoom.  The touch screen drains the battery faster than my other Canon Powershot cameras and the zoom is incredibly difficult to get stable when at full 12 power and my pictures haven't turned out as well as I would like at that distance.  Overall, I really didn't like the Canon Powershot 310, so I am on the fence as to whether or not I will keep this one.  I have a few more days to think about it.  For now... here is a more detailed list of pros and cons:Pros:- Takes incredibly good photos with regard to color.- Easy to use.- The vivid setting is great for flowers and fall colors.- I love the fisheye effect without having to carry around my Canon DSLR camera and lenses.  I also love having the wide angle.- The miniature setting is kind of fun to use.- Feels incredibly heavy and solid, unlike the new 310.- Fits easily in my purse and pocket.Cons:- Can't stand having finger prints all over the screen when I go to take my picture.- Touch screen drains the battery pretty quickly over the other Canon Powershot cameras.- When zooming out, it is very difficult to keep it steady.Not sure what to order if I send this one back.  So, I am still on the fence, as I am partial to Canon cameras over Nikons.  The red color is not as it is shown in the picture.  It is more of a rust/burgandy color of red... it has a bit more brown to it, but I actually like it.UPDATE: 12/12/2011 - I ended up sending this one back and kept the Canon 310.  I am really glad I did.  I get a great battery life and when I compared the photos on this camera vs. the 510, the photos had better color and looked a lot more crisp from the 310.  I am happy with my decision.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Avoid this camara", "Author": "Jay Goodier", "ReviewID": "R36GGRVPESFPB0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a Canon fan. I have owned several of their pocket shooters and always recommend them to friends and family - and still do, just not this one.I purchased this camera with high hopes. On paper, the specs look great.. In reality, it falls short.-As with most point and shoots, the startup time to first image capture is slow. My SD1100 is faster.-Too many blurry images. The camera was either to slow to auto-focus or just never even bothered. I've never had this problem before with Canon, so I don't understand why this better processor would do this.-The touch screen is difficult to use. It is difficult to describe, but let's just say that it is nothing like the touch display on an iPhone.Not as big of a deal, but if you are still considering this camera, I will point out:-It is heavy. It is well made and sturdy with a big screen - this is bound to happen. The screen is nice though..-The battery didn't hold up as long as I thought it would. This may be because I had an Eye-Fi card in it, I am not sure.I would consider the Canon PowerShot SX230HS 12 MP Digital Camera with HS SYSTEM and DIGIC 4 Image Processor (Black) instead.

I bought the Elph 510 for my wife, and after seeing the results first hand, I decided to get one for myself.IMAGE QUALITY: The image quality is extremely good, in my opinion, and its high-ISO quality is very good. Before my first purchase, I checked the review at Steves Digicams, and looked at all of the sample photos, as well as some of the sample photos uploaded by users here on Amazon, and I found them to be very good quality.BATTERY LIFE: The review at Steves mentions the \"poor\" battery life, \"only\" 170 shots, and recommends getting a spare battery. If you're worried about battery life, check out the Power2000 compatible battery for this camera; it's available here on Amazon, and (at this moment) it's selling for $7.99 and free shipping. Its rating is 1200 mah, considerably better than the original Canon battery (870 mah). My wife and I both use these and keep the original Canon battery in our bags for spares. Power2000 ACD-326 Rechargeable Battery for Canon NB-9LTHE TOUCHSCREEN: Once again referring to the Steves review, the touchscreen is of a type that works better with a fingernail or stylus than with a fingertip, like the iPad touchscreen. My wife was worried about getting used to the touchscreen, but has gotten used to it and has no problem at all with it, and neither do I; the first camera I got with a touchscreen was the Canon SD980; it worked just fine, and so does this one.My wife and I both wanted to find a nice, compact camera with big zoom, and the Elph 510 fits our needs perfectly; we are both very happy with it.

It is not even intuitive. Good old button controls are better. Plus SX230 is cheaper, lighter and thinner.ELPH510 is technically thinner than the SX230 but thats because the SX230 thickness is measured including the slightly projected lens. otherwise the SX230 body is thinner and is lot more comfortable in the hand. And I loved the 14x zoom of SX230. It performs very well, gives amazing results and no complaints so far.Giving the ELPH510 3 stars because its not so bad, not so good either.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Camera I ever had!", "Author": "Donny", "ReviewID": "R1Y9ZGP43SBNKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I buy a lot of stuff at Amazon and NEVER write reviews.

Terrible touchscreen.", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R3BPN0DSC369YG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Despite the lack of need for a point-and-shoot camera with the proliferation of smartphones, this camera may not be that useful. But there are those who still use dumbphones or have terrible cameraphones. I have a Canon DSLR, but it is too cumbersome to tote around, so I wanted a more portable camera.It's hard to believe that all the features are packed into this little thing. The images and videos are quite good. There are various settings, but let's be honest - people who'd buy this camera want simplicity, and the auto setting does well. The shutterlag is significantly longer than the DSLR, but that's to be expected. And it's not too bad.The HUGE letdown is the awful touchscreen which is not that responsive like iPhones, Android phones or iPads. It's so annoying. I like the buttons. The scrolling is terrible. I never want to adjust the settings because it's so annoying to fumble through. The ONLY good thing about the touchscreen is the incorporation of video by touching the red circle for recording video. The rest of the touchscreen gizmo sucks. I'm sure that contributes to the decrease in battery life.I was torn between this one and the ELPH 310 HS which does not have the touchscreen and something I already preferred. But the ELPH 310 HS is only 8x optical zoom which is still decent, but not 12x like this one. I can't say no to more optical zooming, so I took the plunge to the touchscreen display. I don't regret my decision of choosing the 510 over the 310 because of the zoom, but the touchscreen is worthless. Thank goodness this camera didn't try to incorporate wifi - I can imagine how annoying that might be.I bumped this up to 4 stars because the camera itself captures wonderful images which is the #1 function of a camera, but that touchscreen nearly makes this a 3-star item. Hopefully you'll find the perfect setting so you won't have to tweak much. It would've been better to upgrade the 310's zoom to 12x and keep it simple.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Canon's best", "Author": "CGScammell", "ReviewID": "R152MCOVLL3I02", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am an admitted Canonphile.

I needed three batteries while walking around Chicago yesterday taking 600 photos.  This is unacceptable!  I can see two batteries, but three?Apparently a lot of energy is spent on the touchscreen, which I also find annoying.

But, enough about me, let's talk about this camera...Optics:The optics are remarkable.  Most people \"focus\" on the 12x optical zoom which *is* pretty remarkable.  It is made even better by the effective built-in image stabilization.  What I find at least equally useful is the \"wider than usual\" wide angle.  For example, it allows me to get more into a picture when I'm in a small room.Images and Video:The pictures, both stills and videos are crystal clear.  I also like that I can zoom while shooting videos.  Auto White Balance is correct, focusing is quick and also spot on, and automatic exposures are remarkably accurate.  Performance in low light is very good (for a camera in this class).Convenience:The camera is small, light, and durable (though it probably couldn't stand being submerged either).  The large display makes it more enjoyable to review pictures and videos while they're still in the camera.  The functions I need, got example flash on/off, and scene selection are readily available.The more esoteric functions... because of the touch screen using them can be a bit cumbersome.  However, if you're like me then you never use them with this kind of camera so it's not an issue.Final Thoughts:There are a number of limitations that apply to this camera (as well as other \"small\" cameras in the < $500 price range): - It's a small camera with a small flash.  You are not going to light an auditorium full of people with it.  However, it does a great job in a dimly lit space for people that are nearby as well as filling in shadows in bright sunlight. - The shutter response is a bit slow for effectively capturing children and pets.  The trick for doing that is to either practice and improve your timing or buy a more expensive and probably larger camera. - As mentioned above, precise manual controls are available but difficult to get to.  If you *really* expect to need these functions then you should probably consider other cameras.Finally, if you want a camera that you can carry with you without a second thought, have ready to take pictures in the blink of an eye, and be confident the images will be accurate in just about every situation without having to adjust anything then this camera is a great choice.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable camera, six stars", "Author": "keeting \"zerak\"", "ReviewID": "R24UORAWGFWT9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We decided to roll the dice and try the touch screen (510) over the newer model and are very pleased.

Will say that with a great deal of zooming in and out and averaging about 250 shots a day, I went through two to three batteries a day, charger works great.  Be aware that Amazon likes to recommend purchasing a case for this camera that is too small, so check the sizes of what they are offering.  I paid less than four dollars for a case that now holds my batteries, but luckily I had a beltloop case from my older Elph that sized out the same as the 510.

Our Sony camera is a fine camera and takes great photos as long as the subject is not moving. I had really wanted to buy a D7000 DSLR but that just wasn't in my current budget. I was a little worried about some of the negative reviews that I read on the 510 but there were so few of them and the price with it being an older model was just too good not to take a chance on it. So far I have taken shots at two soccer practices and the results have been fantastic. I took shots of my daughter practicing punts and was blown away with how many clear frames the camera was able to produce in burst mode (freezing the ball perfectly in multiple frames). Also took some action shots of the kids and dogs and have gotten nothing but great comments on facebook. It would be better to have a better zoom rate but I knew that going in. I have read some complaints about the touch screen and I guess it could be improved on but in my opinion it is suffecient to operate the camera.Another feature I like about this camera is there is an easy to use switch to go from the custom settings to fully automatic. I had never given that switch much thought until the other day when my wife's cameras battery was low and she wanted to borrow mine. I had messed her up in the past by changing the settings on her camera when I used it, and her not knowing how to get it back to the automatic mode that she prefers to use.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super and talented little camera.", "Author": "Sherlock33", "ReviewID": "R1XKRO6DVAS7IW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I also own a Canon Powershot s5 iS, I wanted to get a versatile camera that I could just slip into a pocket at those times that I didn't want to carry the larger one.

It has a 28mm wide angle lens and can take some amazing pictures and videos.  Once you master all the different type of settings on it, you can really take some amazing pictures.  It has a very simple to use user interface touchscreen  with about 24 different mode settings.  One of the main reasons I bought this camera was for HD video and scenery pictures, both of which it does an amazing job at.  It also has a video setting to record 240 FPS and replay them back to you at 60 fps, making it super slow motion, which is probably one of the coolest features.  Although it does not work very well in low light (expected) it still can capture some amazing stuff.  If you are looking to take pictures in low light, there are settings for that, and they turn out incredible. So good in fact that I hardly ever use the flash.  The only time that is needed is when its too dark to see at all!I read some other reviews which mostly said this model has a short battery life and this is definitely true.

I used this for one vacation trip to Disney.  It took good quality photos outside but was disappointing for indoor flash photos when set to intelligent auto mode.  In low light conditions the intelligent auto setting would produce poor quality photos and would pick an ISO setting that gives you a camera shake warning every time.  After contacting Canon support they said that the auto mode shouldn't be used for every situation.  To produce the best photos in certain conditions the program mode should be used to pick the best setting.  Well, when you are traveling and going from outside bright sun to indoor conditions remembering to change the settings gets old and fumbling with the settings can lead to you missing some photo opportunities.  I think the camera should at least take acceptable pictures in all conditions when using the intelligent auto mode.  Maybe I'm asking too much.

After reading many reviews about the ELPH cameras, I was worried about the battery life. Seriously, it was no problem at all.The battery did die after 2 straight hours of my dad trying to figure out all of the intricacies. But I took the camera on a 3 day trip to London (forgot the charger) and didn't need it! I took about 200+ photos and a ton of videos. The battery died just as I was heading on the train back to France.The one thing that REALLY drains the battery is the touch-screen click feature. This camera lets one take a picture just by touching the screen (Like Ashton Kutcher does in the commercial.) Honestly, I don't really see the need for it, so I turned it off in the settings. Saves a lot of battery-life as well as wasted photos, like accidental purse pictures.Image quality is fantastic. Shoots wonderful videos. Photos easily transferable to the computer. So much nicer to carry around than the DSLRs I was looking at.All in all, a wonderful camera.

I decided to try the ELPH 510 because it has high end specs and was an especially good deal on Amazon. I also purchased a Lumix GF3, a micro four thirds camera.The first thing you'll notice about this camera is its small size. In fact, I had to be very careful until my hands adjusted to its near weightless feel -- I almost felt like I was going to drop it. My hunch is that some men (with larger hands) might not like the size because it requires a light touch. This little camera will most certainly slip into your pocket and you'll never have to think twice about packing it, especially when space and weight counts.In general, the camera takes nice photos. The resolution is high and the images are sharp.  The zoom is particularly impressive and there are lots of fun \"filters\" that allow you to take black and white shots, a simulated fisheye lens, or other settings (like sunset mode). The main reason I returned the item to Amazon is because I was more impressed with the Lumix GF3, a micro four-thirds system with a detachable lens and greater manual features that I was trying out at the same time. To be fair, the Lumix is a different kind of camera and it's more expensive, so it's not a true peer-to-peer comparison.When I did a side-by-side comparison, the Lumix out performed the Canon in low-light, in macro-mode, and also captured richer, warmer colors. Images with the Canon were sharp all around -- but the Lumix offers a better depth of field (the subject in the foreground is sharp, but the background is blurry).  The ELPH has an incredibly powerful zoom and outperformed the Lumix.One thing I do not like about the Canon is that it flashes a bright orange light before it takes a photo.  I think that this feature is annoying and it makes it nearly impossible to take candids.  I'd also be self-conscious of shooting in certain circumstances.The Canon gets lousy reviews on battery life, which doesn't seem surprising.  The rechargeable battery is the size of 1 AA and it has to light up a 3\" touchscreen.  All of the reviewers suggested picking up a spare.

Just a couple of drawbacks: 1) Several times I clicked the on/off button instead of the shutter button by mistake (right next to one another), I guess because I was so engrossed in setting up the shot that I didn't notice that my finger had moved. 2) The user manual is huge and only comes in PDF format, and as I did not have time to read through the whole thing before we went on vacation, some of the less-intuitive features I was unable to use, such as the self-timer.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera for the price", "Author": "Tony \"Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R32BVS436B23ZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it was on sale for $159.99 one day and it was purchased for a graduation present. it takes good pictures and a good overall point and shoot camera. it's slim and the coolest feature is it's a touch screen in the back.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just Amazing!!!", "Author": "New Yorker", "ReviewID": "R12AVXNFQQDBX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This small little camera is simply awesome.

In July, when we were on our vacation, out of no reason, the lense didn't work.  So I sent to the Canon repair center.  I was told it should be repaired in 7 working days.  Now it is 21 working days and they are still waiting for parts.  Last week I called the repair center, they told me it should be done in a week.  A week later, I called again, and I was told that it should be done in a week.  I never expected to have a CANON camera that would break in just 6 months (not to mention I only used very lightly).  I never expected that CANON service is so bad as well.  I guess I will never buy CANON in the future!", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Keep Looking for your sure shot!", "Author": "JulianB.", "ReviewID": "R1YBCMPPPU67OK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The service provided by Amazon was flawless as usual but this product with the touch screen was less than perfect, its kinda like a IPad wannabe but unfortunately isnt so stick the the IPad for Ipad functions and with a camera for camera functions.This was a poor attempt at combining the two.

Mo", "ReviewID": "R3JRNQ9N5CCKAU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Summary: If you are looking for a camera to record more than 10 minutes of video continuously, look else where.For me specifically I was looking for a camera (and I'm a Canon fan) that as the fast zoom lens, the chance to go wide angle, and the video recording ability as long as the memory card has space and the battery is still good.I found out that when I was trying to record a speech or event, I put the camera on the tripod and let her rip. Well it shuts down in 10 minutes exactly, every time!  That's my deal breaker right there.  I returned the camera and got my refund.  I thought by putting in a 32GB SD card that I would be set to be able to record an hour easily.  I was also expecting the battery to last at least an hour.I also found out with a brand new battery that after 20 minutes of recording (2 x 10 minutes recording), the battery was almost dead and the battery is expensive, so I would have to buy 3 or 4 batteries, another deal breaker.Side note: I miss the ability to use AA.  I am willing to sacrifice size to being able to use AA.  I wish companies would keep a line of new products that sticked with AA batteries.  If you know of a really good point and shoot camera that can do 1080P videos for more than 60 minutes and uses AA batteries, please let me know.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "ridiculous wifi", "Author": "Ted", "ReviewID": "R5Q0NB2PO157M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "one of the reasons I bought this was the ease of transferring files onto your computers, without a cable, but using wifi. --- this sounds lazy but without having to spend the little effort to connect the cable, I find myself saving files much more often using my cellphone camera + dropbox.I tried the wifi connector, the camera takes > 3 minutes to find my home wifi access point (by all means it's a strong wifi AP, and my computer finds it in no more than 10 seconds). once connected to wifi, I let the camera connect to my PC, and the camera does appear as an \"Other device\" on control panel of windows. but within 10 seconds, the connection is dropped, and the device disappears. All the on-going imports failed. this is really nasty user experience, did Canon software engineers ever QA their product before release???the screen is not so user friendly. having been accustomed to the intuitive and responsive experience on smart phones, I find this \"touch screen\" to be like going back to the 1990's. first of all it's made with old, cheap , resistive touch screen, not the currently standard capacitive touch screen used on all modern smartphones", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not User Friendly", "Author": "Linda R.

Or would you prefer:  THE BIG RED POCKET CANON!!!  THATS RIGHT, let me whip this out real quick.  Stand back, this bad boy will put your eye out.  Ok, I could keep going... forever... but I want to get slightly serious and tell you about this camera.  First, DO NOT GET THE RED CAMERA.  It is not the same color red as in the picture.  It looks washed out this color makes the camera look plastic in person.  I'm sure the black or silver would look much nicer.  Second, if you are looking for a camera to stick in your pocket, try a smaller canon. This camera's super vivid mode makes for some amazing pictures.  The display looks great, this camera's massive touch screen is probably the reason it drains batteries like there is no tomorrow.  Seriously bring TWO or THREE extra batteries...  Kind of ridiculous how quick it dies.  Trade off, because it looks sick!  Touch screen not sensitive and at times it is hard to push the right areas accurately on the screen.  The photo's are nice crisp and clear so that is the main thing.  The 12X zoom is awesome and the main reason I bought this camera.  All in all I would say this is a good camera, but the touch screen is not worth the extra money in my opinion the ELPH 310 is a better deal an probably a lot more compact.  This is a sweet camera though with more features than I will ever need or learn how to use.  Before I leave you a couple things more things about the camera.  Obviously the Big Red Pocket Canon is fun to play with. The Big Pocket Canon shoots in bursts, so fast you might think it's scary... etc etc filthy joke.  Ok ok I'm done.l put up a few pictures for you guys an girls so you can see what I am getting.  I think most are on AF.  With an old lousy memory card.  I just bought a new memory card to see if high speed cards actually do make a noticeable difference in photos.
