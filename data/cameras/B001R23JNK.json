I was a little nervous ordering a camera that was just released and had no reviews, but the fujifilm finepix z20 had such good reviews, that I decided to take a chance on the newer model.So far everything is perfect.  The battery charged quickly and setup was very simple.  This camera is so easy to use, which is important to me, since I'm kind of technology-challenged.  With most cameras, I have trouble navigating the menu, but this camera is very simple to work.  Also, the screen on the back is very large, to make viewing the pictures easy.  There is one great feature on the camera that I really like.  There is a setting that when activated, will always take two pictures every time you snap a picture.  One with a flash and one without, and store both for you to view.  This way you never have to worry about your pictures being too dark or too bright.  The pictures are crystal clear, and I'm very glad I've purchased this camera.I can't comment on the software, as I haven't used it yet, but everything else has been great.", "Date": "March 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bargain Compact", "Author": "E. J Tastad \"ejt\"", "ReviewID": "RTMD09NB0SBX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Compact SizeQuality FeelSliding lens cover doubles as power switchFast LCD refresh (must be 60 hz, but only in high performance mode)Weather Sealed buttonsCons:Battery LifeNo full manual modeOnly 3x optical zoomNo optical shake reductionBottom Line: Great value for a quality feeling budget compact camera.  Image quality is fine, I see no problems with smaller prints up to ISO 800, this is far better than my previous point and shoot that was half the resolution.  My favorite features are the weather sealed buttons (the camera isn't weather sealed, get the Z33wp for that), but the buttons are rubber covered and liquid can't get in around them, and my other favorite feature is the high frame update on the LCD.  As long as you set the menu option for high performance, the rear LCD updates very rapidly, any motion is updated instantly.  This is much improved over most of the competition, but no reviews I see mention this.Some people are complaining about the quality of the images, but either they have a bad sample or are just viewing the images at 100% on a computer monitor.  Prints are fine.  I will comment that the rear LCD is sometimes grainy appearing, but the final images are great.  This is because the rear LCD has a high frame update, about 60 hz, and it needs to set the sensitivity very high in low light in order to show you an image at that rate, so the display comes grainy.  When you take the picture it is fine.Overall this is a pretty average performing camera that is inexpensive.  It has a semi manual mode for setting your own ISO, EV compensation, but it lacks a few other options.  The aperture just uses a couple values, and can't be selected manually.  If you can pick this up for about a hundred bucks it is a bargain.  If you get up near one hundred fifty there are probably better options available.Update: I found the condition people must be getting grainy pictures.  This camera doesn't have a powerful flash, and in a large room trying to take a picture of a subject maybe 15 or 20 ft away the flash doesn't have the power to illuminate them adequately.  If you use this indoors in a dim room, it is fine at close range, but not great for a Christmas program or a picture of a presenter across the room.  In these situations you might try disabling the flash.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "You will LOVE this camera...", "Author": "Sara J.

I've used it out on the town, inside with flourescent lighting, and outdoors, and it's definitely 10.1 megapixels of AWESOME.  You can read about all its details above (it's red-eye removal, video capabilities, etc).. but here are the items I wasn't sure about when I ordered the camera from Amazon, but was proved wrong:1) The camera looks expensive, NOT cheap.  I was worried about the little stones looking feminine or cheap, but they're very tiny and does NOT make the camera look \"girly\".2) The sliding door is a great idea, because it protects the lens, and makes the camera ready to GO once you open it!  Normally cameras take 10 seconds to ready to shoot (power.. ok, adjust, click, hold, wait..) Not this camera!  You open the door, click the button, and view the picture within 3 seconds.  It's so nice!  Plus, it's ready to go AFTER taking a picture much more quickly.3) The sliding door has a nice \"click\" so don't worry about it opening up in your purse/pocket... really.  It's fine.4) I love the buttons on the back of the camera--they're larger than other cameras, easy to read and press, looks more modern, etc.So... BUY THIS CAMERA!

When I first saw it I loved the color (Orange) and small, sleek style. I snapped a few pictures which looked grainy on the LCD screen- I quickly turned to the online reviews and found out this is a common complaint of this camera.. HOWEVER, once you download them onto your computer they look amazing. Well worth it for the price!I love the flip open cover seeing as our last camera got sand in the zoo lens and ended up never working the same. This added protection is great!One other thing that made this a 4 out of 5 star rating is having to use the USB cable to upload pictures onto the computer, which I do quite frequently.

Images are not stunning by any means, but certainly serviceable.  There's no reason this should use a 10 megapixel sensor; the optics of the camera are not up to par with that resolution.  Indoor shots without flash are a mixed bag, though the camera does make it pretty easy to turn the flash on and off.  Bright outdoor shots do look good, as they do with most cameras.The video feature actually surprised me; it's quite good!

So handy we now own two!!", "Author": "K. Salinger \"FNP, RN\"", "ReviewID": "R13GG1GX544ZN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my 5 year old daughter, who had been begging for a \"real\" camera for quite some time. We were preparing for a trip to Costa Rica and it seemed the perfect time for such a gift.Well I must say that we just returned from our trip yesterday and here I am now ordering this exact same camera for myself!Both my husband and I were highly impressed with the ease of use and great pictures this camera takes. Granted - if you see yourself as some consummate photographer this is not the unit for yo - but for your average person who wants great pictures without having to fiddle with various focusing mechanisms, fancy settings, etc. this unit is perfect!I took over my little girl's brand new camera to some extent because it was just so easy to use. By the time my husband would have his more expensive camera ready to snap I had taken several snaps on this little gem of a camera - it was great!! It has many features we didn't use - pretty much just straight forward pictures and the zoom feature was it. However just with that our holiday pictures are great. We inserted a 2GB card and took about 380 pictures and there seemed to be room for several hundred more. We were gone for 12 days, took pictures at least 9-10 days of that and only used 1/3 of the battery or so. We didn't use the software as we just insert the memory card into our laptops to upload, so can't comment on any of that.One feature that I found especially invaluable is the built in lens cover which also functions as the on/off for the camera (camera on when you open it, camera off when you close). The beauty is that the camera lens is protected without the bother of having to use a camera case. You can carry this camera in your pocket, in your purse, on your wrist or in hand without any worry of damage. When you want to use it you just slide open the lens cover & snap your quick picture. There is no fuss or bother with a case and no long warm up period - it's essentially ready to go when you open the lens cover to turn it on. This feature quick snaps while on the go and other spur of the moment pictures incredibly easy. I didn't have to worry about damaging the lens (and especially so, I didn't have to worry about my 5 y.o. daughter damaging the lens)At one point during our trip my 5 year old wasn't paying attention and feel down pretty hard off a curb - camera and all smashing to the pavement. The camera took a what seemed to be a hard hit on the pavement and we thought for sure it would be broken. Nope! The camera now has a little brown permanent scar on one corner from the fall, but otherwise it is completely fine. Had it not had the built in lens cover it likely would have been seriously damaged for sure, as the front is what hit when she fell.You know why I love this thing, but what about my original purpose of having this a camera for my 5 year old?!? Well, for those considering it for kids, My 5 y.o. daughter LOVES this camera. It has been easy for her to use and carry and she loves that it isn't goofy or clunky like most kids cameras. It's also great that it takes tons of pictures as you'll likely get some odd stuff based on a 5 y/o's idea of great pictures (lovely curbs, stitching on a bedspread, dirt, and so on...). I recommend it for responsible little ones who will be able to remember to shut the lens cover (which is easy since that turns it off) after each shot to protect the lens. The point and shoot aspect is so easy even a 3 y.o. can use this camera.All-in-all, this is a GREAT camera for responsible and smart little ones in addition to being a GREAT camera for adults! Our whole family is impressed and we will shortly own two of these once mine arrives.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "I purchased this for a gift, but I kept it for myself", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R1ZPTRVJOEDO6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*****ETA:  I love this camera but I decided to just give it to my nephew instead; the more I experimented with it, I did not care for the USB plug-in to be located inside the battery compartment.  It's a fine camera otherwise.  Instead, I bought this one for myself - Fujifilm FinePix Z70 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)*****This was intended for a young relative of mine - since this camera has an optical zoom lens in the internal style, I thought it would be a safer camera for little ones to use, in case it is dropped.  More on that later!  And the whirl white color scheme is perfect for young kids.But after testing the camera to make sure it was ok prior to gifting it, I fell in love with the Z30 myself.  Now I'll have to go and buy another - I'm partial to Fuji cameras and I couldn't pass up the great price on this one. This is my 8th Fuji camera purchased since 2004, I love them.The Z30 is TINY - and the screen is big and bright - I have no trouble seeing anything on this LCD screen even outside in bright sunlight.  It's tiny and lightweight and easy to carry in either a pocket or small bag.And since the lens has a cover - and this is the way the camera is powered on/off - by sliding the lens cover open (like the first Fuji digital cameras) you almost don't need to buy a separate case....although I do keep mine in a case because I don't like the exterior to get scratched.A couple of complaints for an almost-perfect entry level camera:>>>  The USB port is located inside the battery compartment.  I don't know why they couldn't have designed it for the side of the camera like most others.  I'm afraid of opening flimsy battery compartments unless I absolutely have to.  Even if I want to use my SD card reader instead of transferring photos via the USB cord, I still have to open this compartment.>>>  There is no good location to grip the camera on the back of the camera.  The entire area is composed of LCD screen and buttons.  At least the back area of the camera is rubberized so it does help with the gripping.But the pro's way outnumber my complaints:>>>  Quick response when opening the lens cover to take the first shot>>>  Takes beautiful life-like color-saturated pictures>>>  Fast response time after taking a flash picture>>>  Takes good videos - better than my expensive Panasonic Lumix>>>  Love the auction setting for grouping shots together in 1 frame>>>  SR Auto - there's no thinking, just point and shoot>>>  Lithium-ion battery - the charge lasts for weeksOne \"pro\" which I want to take the time to make stand out among the previous is I love that this camera enables you to choose standard color, saturated color, and even black & white photos.Choosing the saturated color setting (which is accessed through the Shooting Menu Options), produces almost the same effect as what Canon advertises as the \"Poster Effect\" on its new line of Canon A495 cameras  Canon PowerShot A495 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.3x Optical Zoom and 2.5-Inch LCD (Red).  You can make some really nice wall art by choosing this setting and tweaking it a bit with Picasa.Bottom Line: This Fuji is a good entry-level camera and I recommend it for just about anyone that is looking for an easy to use digital camera (even young children) AND it's built tougher than it appears.  Case in point:  Two days after I received this, I was sitting at my kitchen table when it slipped out of my hands and hit the floor (my condo is built on a slab).  I thought the camera was broken, but I turned it back on and it's none worse for the wear.  Not even a scratch.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Finepix Z30", "Author": "Lilac Lily", "ReviewID": "R3ARBH2WL1KG28", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the white and black edition of this camera, and I really love the stylish look of it. Wben I first opened the package though, I was a bit taken aback by the small size of this camera. It's hardly bigger than the palm of my hand. I guess, I had been so used to my old camera(and I mean really old), that this Fujifilm camera seemed tiny in comparison. I have gotten used to it now, and I love the fact that it's small enough to fit in your jeans pocket. However, I would suggest a nice case for the camera, just because it seems a bit fragile.There is no seperate viewer on this camera, it only has the large 2.7\" LCD display which is all I ever use anyway. You have the ability to take 10MP pictures, but if you don't need that many megapixels (say, if you don't really want to enlarge your pics a lot) you have the option to set the megapixels from anywhere between 2MP's -10MP's. I really like that option because taking all your pictures with 10 megapixels does take up a lot of space on your computer or SD card. Also, you can make longer videos than the stated 60seconds when you reduce the megapixels.Another thing I would like to mention is that this camera included a battery and battery charger. For some reason I couldn't find any information about that on the product page when I placed my order, and thus I bought another battery and charger. This might be obvious to some people but it wasn't to me so I thought I'd mention it here. The picture quality seems pretty good so far, especially when you have plenty of light. The flash isn't great and pictures of distant objects in a darker room do not come out very well. Overall, I think it's a great buy and I would highly recommend it.UPDATE: After taking this camera on a little trip and taking plenty of pictures I just wanted to add some more information. I actually had to remove two stars from my original rating because all of the pictures that I took inside or in areas without a lot of bright light came out grainy, blurry and with very dull colors. I was pretty disappointed about that. The only time the pictures came out right was when I was taking them outside with plenty of bright sunshine. This is not what I was expecting at all and I can't really recommend this camera anymore.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Jlovelace \"JL\"", "ReviewID": "R1EPXYHV8Z8K7O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter.

I've had it for a month or so now, so I can't attest to its durability yet, but I have used it a LOT already. I took it with me on a spring break trip and found that it is small enough for my pocket, easy to use, and takes great pictures. It has a good strong flash, and I really noticed this while I was taking pictures for someone else with their camera in a dark room. I really like how quickly it turns on - other people missed picture moments waiting for their cameras to start up, but this one was fast enough 90% of the time. I like how quickly the camera is ready to take another picture - under one second (when the battery is low, it seems to take longer). The image does appear grainy on the screen, but it looks great once you get it on the computer. Several people commented on the large size of the viewing screen. I liked the waterproof buttons - I did wind up working in wet, muddy areas, and this camera was fine. I took almost 250 pictures over break, and I have to do very little editing on them - resize, sometimes crop, and it's ready to go. I got great pictures of a beaver dam a long way off; the zoom served me well and it came out very clear when I cropped and resized it. I have wonderful pictures from this trip - indoors, outdoors, dark rooms, bright areas, people, animals, nature, architecture, gardens, action, still... I'm in love with this little camera!I went through both of my batteries (buy a spare, they're handy) and had to recharge one during the five-day trip, but that's probably because I spent at least a third of every day with it in my hand.Three things I noticed:1. It won't turn on while it's plugged into the computer to upload unless the original battery is in. When I use the extra one that I bought separately, it won't upload. Maybe this is an issue with the particular battery I received or the type of battery I bought (GT Max Battery Pack for FUNP-45 3.6V Li-ion), but it could definitely be an issue with the camera. But considering how great of a camera this is all around, I don't mind too much.2. If you're not careful, you will bump the lens cover (which doubles as an on-off switch) and turn the camera off while you're viewing your pictures. When you've just sorted through 100+ photos to find that one image and you accidentally turn it off, that's a pain! Again, not a big issue - I figured out finally that by pressing and holding the arrow buttons, you can move through the pictures much faster.3. The video function is a little difficult to figure out... Or maybe that's just me.I highly recommend this camera to someone like me, who takes pictures only for fun, wants fairly high-quality images, and has a budget of under $100. I don't recommend it to someone who wants really first-class pictures, like an art/photography student - this is not for artists, it's for very casual hobbyists and amateurs, like me.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for its size", "Author": "P.

I purchased it because it was so small and would fit in my pocket, out of sight of my 18 month old grandson I recently visited. My second grandson, his brother, was born just two weeks ago and I was hoping to get some great shots of the two of them together. Since it's not good to use a flash around little ones, especially newborns, I turned it off and was surprised at the quality of the indoor photos and videos. Granted, there were a few blurry ones when I didn't wait for the camera to focus first, or he didn't hold still long enough, but the majority were amazing. Outside photos and videos were crisp and clear and the playback on the videos was smooth and synched with the sound. Battery usage was minimal - I spent a week taking picture after picture, video after video and never had to charge the battery. When I got home and checked, it was only one-third used up. Awesome for such a small camera. I had tried the Kodak C180 and couldn't even get the settings adjusted without using a third of the batteries.Needless to say, I am very pleased with this camera.

McColl", "ReviewID": "RE5PBS83JNYG4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I sell cameras/camcorders for a living and I have to say that this is one of the worst ones I've come across in a while. While the syle and design might look cool, it is still a camera, and isn't a camera used for capturing important moments? Preserving memories, etc? Then why on earth would you put those things in the hands of something faulty? Yes I am a bit anal when it comes to these things, but it is for your own good I promise.I would only recommend this camera to a young child, as they are really the only ones who might not know better or even care about the quality of the images.  While it is stylish and pocket sized, so are many other cameras of far, far, far better quality than this. First of all, the trendy sliding front piece makes it so your lense never comes out, hence lousy zoom and not much image diversity. The menu is easy to navigate, but again, so are many others in the \"point-and-shoot\" category. I wish people would open up their minds a bit and embrace technology--it is as if some are just too indimidated by it to venture into something perhaps a bit more complicated (read: sophisticated).  As I patiently tell my customers, a camera should be an investment...not an impulse buy because something is cute or popular.The flash on this thing is awful. It's literally like a sputtering blink that leaves you wondering if it even illuminated anything.  Forget taking pictures indoors with low-light, because you'll just have orange blurs.  There is no image stabilization, (whether it says it has it or not--I promise, try it out, it doesn't.)  I mounted it on a table top tripod and held it still and the pictures STILL had a blur to them.  This is because the camera has a cheaply made sensor that can't capture anything of quality.ONE Okay feature, on most Fujifilm cameras, is the color quality. If you can actually get a clear shot, the color is very nice and vivid. Sometimes so vivid in fact, that it looks like the saturation was upped about +5. This could be a good thing or bad, depending on your situation.  I'm not knocking Fuji's cameras in general--there are some quite nice ones, but do yourself a favor and skip this one. It is more like a colorful toy than a good quality camera.Great cameras in the same price range:  Canon Powershot A480, Nikon Coolpix S220, Sony Cybershot W180.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "3rd Finepix Owner", "Author": "S.

The only downside being that you have to wait to view pictures if your battery is low whereas on the previous model I had, you could plug it in and view/download pics while it was charging.I tried out a bunch of cameras before I bought this third camera. I hate cameras that have a significant delay when you click to take a picture. This camera is fast like all other fujis I've owned. The options are numerous and easy to set up.

We were building a house, and it was much easier to deal with than my husband's full-sized Nikon when taking update pictures. It takes decent photos, although not as good as digital pictures from a larger, more inclusive camera. Since this is what I expected, it didn't bother me. I used my little Fuji for all kinds of things instead of dragging out the big Nikon. Unfortunately, it was stolen from a hotel. Rather than get a better camera as my husband suggested, I opted for the same little Fuji because I loved it so much. It's a great little camera for grabbing and taking quick pictures, day trips around the area, and just about anything for which one would use a more expensive digital camera. I also love the fact that I don't need a case to keep the camera eye clean and the larger lcd picture frame on the back.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "what a bargain!", "Author": "soflokid", "ReviewID": "RRVK8EHM1H6J4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "not sure what its selling for now, but at $70 delivered i bought two, one for each daughter. the white with 60's striping is not my bag, but hey, for the money, who cares and the kids like it. its way too feature packed to describe it all here, but man, what a great value.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great while they work.

I bought a black one and a pink one for my wife and daughter for Christmas.  The black one died in the early Spring.  Fortunately I had purchased a Square Trade Warranty to cover the first death in the family and Square Trade sent me a check for a replacement in just a few days.  I then replaced the black one with an orange one, which has already proven to be a mistake.  Last week, just when we needed the cameras for homecoming pictures, both the pink one and the orange one died.  These two cameras were still under factory warranty, so I had to pack them up and mail them to the Fujifilm repair center in Edison, NJ.  Turnaround time is estimated at a few weeks and the customer service woman at Fuji was gruff and nasty on the phone.  Even worse, after they're repaired I don't expect these cameras to last long after they are returned to us.  Luckily, I got a Canon SD1200IS for Christmas and it has worked flawlessly, so homecoming was not a total loss.When our Z30s have died, they've died suddenly and completely...no power, no nothing.  To make things even worse it has happened with absolutely no warning.  One minute they're working fine, the next you've got nothing more than a $100 paperweight.  Think about how happy you'd be if this happened to you in the middle of a vacation in a remote location (like a national park) where you couldn't readily find a replacement.  Just throw some gingko biloba in your camera bag so you can at least remember what you saw.Consumers reading this review are, of course, welcome to buy whatever camera they want.

I bought mine about 8 months ago for less than $80.  This is a great little pocket camera.  It is my \"go to\" camera when I don't want to lug my Canon XSi and 3 lenses around.  I carry mine in my front shirt pocket and usally have it with me.  I have shot over 3000 pics and most of them come out pretty good.  Obviously, not as good as my Canon, but good enough for it's size.  This year I carried it through 12 days in Europe and 8 days skiing in Colorado.  On both trips I left my Canon at home because in Europe I didn't want to chance it getting stolen, and in Colorado I wasn't going to take my big $800 camera on the slopes.  So this Fuji has gotten a lot of use.  Three things I really like about this camera:  1.  It's small enought to carry around in my pocket, 2.  The slide on the front which protects the lens and turns the camera on.  You simply slide the cover and shoot.  And there's very little delay so you're ready to shoot in about a second.  3.  The battery life is very good and charges quickly.

There isn't another like this camera that has as much quality for it's price. The camera is very sturdy, simple to use, and effective. The look on this camera is simply gorgeous. I bought the white swirl version of the Z30, and it really does look nice (and not feminine as I thought it might). Though there isn't a lens window and only an LCD screen, it's not much a of a drawback for me - though i can understand if others would want this feature. The LCD screen itself is conveniently large, and at the refresh rate that the camera gives, it's simply stunning to see in motion. Because the refresh rate is very high, it also produces top notch images. However I do need to mention that this camera is NOT powered on AA batteries but on Lithium batteries, which may bother some. However Fujifilm supplies this camera with 1 Lithium battery and 1 charger with the camera itself, so it really is not an issue for me. Also while viewing the pictures it moves unexpectedly slowly while browsing at full screen, so one might have to view all pictures as an album to effectively skim through the photos already taken. Again, not much of a deal breaker.This camera also was much much smaller than my previous one (Canon powershot a460) and much more efficient. If you are unsure about this product, and willing to pay the amount amazon offers, I suggest you buy it. The sale on amazon will not last (as there are only 9 and counting on sale), and there really isn't a better deal out there.Pros:10.1 megapixel camera produces high refresh rate and great imagessmall but yet sturdyVery appealing to just...stare atPackaged with lithium battery and chargersimple to use, yet with a lot of options for those wanting moreCons:uses Lithium instead of AAslow browsing speed of photos takenonly LCD viewing screen, no traditional camera viewer", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "fuji z30", "Author": "Johnny L.

Well, I've had my fujifilm for about a month an a half now, and it was really nice until a couple weeks ago, when a good chunk of plastic fell off. Now, i don't treat my camera like royalty, and I'm a student, so i often put it in my backpack with  my all my other necessities, however i do have a nice bag for it, and never dropped it more than a few inches, so this was a surprise to me. And now, for some reason, when I turn my finepix on, there are a bunch of blinking white lines across the screen, and if i leave it on long enough in this condition, the screen goes completely white. So, i tried to rescue this camera myself, so i unscrewed the plastic back, (which was very difficult because in addition to the 4 phillips head screws, there is one 3-notched screw on the bottom, that none of my screwdrivers would easily fit into) and picked up the screen that had some sticky stuff on the back, which was messing with the connection to the lens, and viola! all was well. Then the next day the same thing happened. only this time it was spoaratic. My warranty is still valid, and I am considering returning it, but doing so would cost me more money, and time. And this may be a one time thing, but I don't want to wait until my warranty expires to fine out. do yourself a favor.

I wanted it to take pictures of my friends and other things since my graduation was coming up. Almsot everything was right the color, it was a fujifilm and my friends had fujifilms that took excellent pictures. So when I bought it and took it home I was so wrong.Cons:1. grainy pictures2. crammed buttons3. Software is kind of crappy4. Looks very cheap. It looks like it is made out of plastic5. My LG Dare takes way better pictures than this! and its 3.2 megapixel.Pros:1. small size2. great color and glossI was really disappointed with this camera and took it back the next day. To whoever who is looking to buy this camera don't waste your time or money. BUY A KODAK!!", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't condeme Fuji or Amazon.", "Author": "N.

And then a few of the \"good\" ratings reviews. Well after a lifetime in professional photography and 10 years retail cameras sales, this last review is typical. And is way off base. Some one buys a product, it is defective, but do they take it back right away? No they sit on it for 30+ days.  Returning two items to Amazon. I followed their return policy and had no problems.  I returned ( had in the mail) 2-3 days after I got the items. I purchased knee braces. I ordered one size- too small. The next size  was too big. I started amazon's return immediately. Amazon accepted the returns and credited my charge card. What did this experience tell me? Don't order clothing items from on line vendors! It's not Amazon's fault, but my odd size. Now lets talk about Fuji. I have a the Fuji S20 Pro ($1500.00  & a few years old). One day, I pick up the camera and 1/2 of the screen is blank. I called Fuji, not the place I bought it! Fuji said that is sounded like a sensor defect, please send the camera in. I did that. Long story short, Fuji fixed the camera as it was in fact a defect that they took responsibility for. All it cost me was $8 for shipping to Fuji and I had an out of warranty camera repaired at no charge. Now of course this is not the norm for out of warranty repairs, but Fuji could have charged me and I would have not known the difference or they could have told me to \"take a long walk on a short bridge\".  The moral of my story find out the return policy of retailers and follow it quickly. For service try to deal direct with manufacturers. They normally go out of their way to helpful.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dont Buy...Terrible!!!!", "Author": "cbernardo", "ReviewID": "R2KPX0HG3ZB2WX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't believe the reviews, this camera stinks bad.
