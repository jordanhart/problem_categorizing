What I found is that this camera can work wonders! I took about 50 pictures today in varying light of the Atlanta scene.  I printed one out on my printer just to see what it looks like, and I was just amazed at the quality of the pictures! There is absolutely no need to get anything higher than a 3.1 MP.  I took a picture of my grandmother close up on the Portrait mode and I can see every little pore and hair! (Perhaps it's a bit too good?)  This camera is for my 63yo grandmother who has trouble operating a mouse.  She already, after only one day, knows how to use this camera.  It's extremely easy to use.  Neither my grandmother nor I needed to touch the manual to work it.The sole reason I remove a star from its rating is due to the software.  Mine was corrupt, so I had to Download it from Kodak.com  The software is also a very poor tool for editing your pictures.  If you plan on editing them much, I suggest getting a program like Adobe photoshop or Microsoft Photo Editor.  The software does make it slightly easier to Download pictures from the camera, but if you have a program like Adobe or Ulead Photo Explorer, the software is not necessary at all.  Ofoto, the website Kodak recommends to upload your pictures to, is great!  I like the way they show the pictures online in not only clickable thumbs but also slide shows.So far, the battery life of the camera is fine! I used it all day today, on and off constantly and there is still no flashing battery light.Just a word of advise: I would definately invest in at least a 128MB memory card for this camera.  16 is simply not enough, especially once you realize how much you love this camera, and trust me, you will! I'd also recommend rechargeable batteries as Kodak gives you a pair that are not rechargeable.  Oh, and the Dock is a waste of money and a collector of dust.  Don't bother with it. First of all it's useless, unless you got the one with the printer attatched, but even if you did get the dock with its own printer, you'd still be spending more on the dock than professional photo developing. I hope this helps.

Two things drew me to the Kodak DX6340:  1.) The 4X OPTICAL zoom, which for some reason breaks the 3X optical zoom standand, 2.) The review by Consumer Reports.Regardless of the Consumer Reports rating I am extremely happy with the camera, but a few things CR pointed out confirmed my decision:1.) Longest battery life.  CR claims 900 photos, but that is without using the LCD.  With heavy use of the LCD I get about 200 photos.  Either way it is about 2-4 times comparable cameras.2.) Shortest delay between shots at 2 sec.  Next best was 3 sec according to CR which is a 50% increase in delay.3.) LCD size.  This camera has 1.8\" and many comparables have 1.5\".  Translated, this camera has 20% more viewing area.4.) Price.  Of the top 4-5 comparible cameras reviewed in CR, this was the cheapest.Also, software was very easy to install, and is better than all the software that came with either my printer or scanner.", "Date": "November 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera, easy to use, all the features you need", "Author": "Brian R.

It was between this Kodak and the previous model (the DX6330). We decided to go with this camera though and we certainly haven't been disappointed. The picture quality is amazing. There are so many different modes of actually taking the picture (i.e. close up, landscape, night shot) that no matter what your conditions are, there is an option for taking a brilliant picture.The menus are easy to navigate through and downloading the pictures couldn't be easier. Some people have said that the battery life doesn't last long but i've been using my camera for weeks now, taking maybe 200 pictures and I haven't changed the batteries once.The camera also does movies up to the limit of the memory - not any set time as other cameras do, meaning as long as you have free memory you can film, which is a nice feature.The only think I would recommend is additional memory, but I think thats the same with every camera. Finally, we chose the 6340 above the 6330 as it was an additional $50 for a slightly better zoom and two more options to choose when taking a picture (moving and landscape or something like that).I'm no digital camera expert, i only wanted to take some pictures when I went out and about and this is the perfect camera for capturing those perfect moments!", "Date": "October 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures, Great Value!", "Author": "Devin in Texas", "ReviewID": "R1I6UYX3IC9IH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a month of research and reading a lot of customer reviews, I narrowed my choices to Nikon Coolpix 3100, Fujifilm A210, Canon A70, and the Kodak DX6340.  I ruled out the fujifilm A210 because of it's limited features, and the fact that it requires Fuji xD memory cards...xD cards are expensive, and are not as common as compact flash or secure digital cards!  The Nikon 3100 had plenty of features, however it was too small for my hands and lightweight.  I felt I hard to curl my fingers to avoid covering the lens hence I could not get a comfortable grip on the camera.  The Nikon is made of 100% plastic and I wasn't about to spend $245 on a toy-like camera!The choice was tough between this kodak camera and the Canon A70, but I finally decided on the kodak.  Both cameras have similar features, both take and process shots at similar speed.  The Canon has an AF assist lamp, the Kodak has a similar low-light AF mechanism.  Unlike the canon A70, the kodak DX6340 does not include a memory card, however, it's 16MB internal memory allows you to practice and familiarize yourself with the camera right out of the box.  Both cameras have a solid, heavy feel to them and are made of metal and plastic.In comparing pictures taken with both the canon A70 and the kodak DX6340, the kodak produced sharper images, and the color in the kodak prints was right-on!  Indoor shots with the kodak are great!  The sport mode on the kodak Dx6340 does a good job in capturing objects in motion without any blurriness.  The kodak also has an image orientation sensor that's really cool!  The Easy Share software that comes with the DX6340 is easy to use, and the pictures transfer quickly with no problems to the computer.  By default, the software runs automatically when starting windows which can slow down start up, but you can turn this feature off through Windows.I would recommend a larger capacity memory card, and rechargable batteries with this camera.  Some things to keep in mind when shopping for a digital camera:1.) Size matters!  Those small, lightweight, mint box cameras are nice, but if you have shaky hands be prepared for blurry images!2.) If you plan on printing pictures at home, make sure your printer supports a higher resolution...you can spend $1,000 on a camera, but it won't do you much good if you'll be printing low res images.3.) Don't fall into the 'Mega Pixel Trap.'  I have enlarged my pictures up to 11\" x 14\" and still get high quality print outs with this camera!You can't go wrong with the kodak DX6340!

Yes, reviewing photos will necessitate turning the camera on which makes the lens come out. On my old Fuji, (finexpix 2600), the review mode could be used without exposing the lens.2. Yes, the 'auto' mode and the 'manual' mode are 6 or 7 clicks removed on the rotary dial. In between those 2 are modes like 'sport', 'landscape', 'portrait' 'night' etc. To me, it's not a major deal, as the dial can be rotated quickly, and having the manual mode with your individualized options at the very end saves trying to figure out which stop you are at (you just rotate the dial to the end). 3. No. Getting the intended picture frame in the LCD screen simply requires pushing in on the joystick button that's at the center of the dial. The LCD then lights up and you can frame the picture using that and not the 'peep-hole'. Another push, and it's off. (You CAN set the LCD screen to be permanently on in the menu, but for an individual picture, you only have to just push in the joystick button as I described.)4. No. Pictures can be reviewed without accessing the menu by pushing in the 'review' button. This brings up all your pictures, and you can move through them by using the joystick.Overall, I think the user interface with this model is very much simpler than my Fuji's was. The rotary dial selects the modes, there is a review button to show pictures, a delete button for the obvious, a flash button to cycle through the flash modes, and a menu button to pick other settings (white balance etc.)The joystick in the center of the rotary dial makes it very easy to click through any of the options.  If I hadn't used my Fuji in a while, I'd have to check the manual for how to change settings.

The optional dock comes with a rechargable battery.It can connect right up to a laptop or desktop with ease throught the USB port.It compresses prictures well so you can take as many as you want at highest resolution (but pruchase a 128 MB or 256 MB SD Memory chip for lots and lots of photos).The photo quality challanges some of the real film cameras in the marketplace.It has a real photo lense not cheap plastic.It feels good in a large or small hand.

I decided on digital because I could print the pictures at home and the images would last forever in my pc or on a disk. Plus the added bonus of never having to buy film again.  When the camera arrived I just simple put the battery in and the 128 meg SD card I had ordered seperately (camera comes with internal 16 megs rated at 17 pictures in best picture quality)and started taking pictures. After I installed the software. I transfered the pictures to my PC and they looked amazing. When I printed some pictures they looked quit good as well but the colors did seem to change a little but I attribute that to my printer.  The camera has seven picture modes, one mode you can use to manually set shutter speed and other factors ( Stuff I don't know anything about ) and a video mode. The video mode can store almost twelve minutes of video with my 128 meg sd card. According to the user manual. I haven't tried it yet.  The camera uses CRV3 lithium, AA lithium or rechargeable AA Ni-MH batteries. Approximately 450, 320, or 180(per charge) pictures respectively. According to the user manual.

My first digicam was a 1.2mp Olympus, which i loved and still use sometimes.  Then last summer i \"upgraded\" to a nikon coolpix 3100.  I hated that camera.  Took great outdoor shots, but my indoor ones were dark and blue-tinted.  I just bought this Kodak yesterday as a replacement..and i am amazed.  I have a kodak film camera that takes the most incredible pictures, and so i was looking to kodak for the digital camera in the hopes that it would have the same vivid colors of my film camera, and it most certainly does. What I love about this camera:SOOOO easy to use! The menu items have descriptions so you immediately know what is what without looking it up.The joystick is an incredible toolThe dial is tough to turn, but that's a plus because it won't be turning on accidentally in your bag, which was a problem with my previous cameras.The EasyShare software is awesome, and so versatile and easy to use.the picture quality!  true color, vivid, crisp. Plus, the write speed is really minimal so you can take pictures quickly one after the other.I think the software is my favorite thing about this camera.  You can email pictures straight from the software, and send copies to yourself...you can edit the pictures quickly and easily, and the images are the size of the screen so you dont' have to zoom in to get a good look.My indoor pictures were initially dark, but I've been playing around with the flash and some of the manual options, and it's been taking great pictures.  Quick fix; i set the flash to \"fill flash\" and even though the flash was still going off with the \"auto\" setting, the fill flash pictures were ten times brighter and more true color.  The shutter speed is great.  That was my second biggest gripe about the nikon; i have a baby and a toddler, and capturing the moment was impossible with the Nikon.  The best buy rep said it would be a little slower with the Kodak, but i have not found that to be the case at all; I've yet to lose a smile and i've taken more than fifty pictures in the last 24 hours.  Also, the zoom is very effective on this camera, whereas on others i've tried, you don't really see a difference and if you do it's usually sacrificing quality. I only gave the camera four stars because i agree that you should always leave some room for improvement.  In the case of the DX6340, it's heavy!  Heavier than my Nikon, at least.  Also, you really need two hands to turn it on.  That was one nice thing about both my Olympus and my Nikon; onehanded turn-on.  But really it's a small thing, and at least this way it's not turning on accidentally and wasting battery power.I would really recommend this camera to anyone, novice or not.  I thought i'd be \"offended\" by the ease of the software, but it's so great.  Most of the time, you pay for features that you'll probably never use.  This is such an efficient little package.  There are a few extras that you will definitely toy with, and the software is useful without being overwhelming.  Everything you need is very easy to find, and the picture quality and shutter speed are amazing.

The camera focuses well and provides as clear an image as possible with 3.1 resolution.  The only blurry pictures I encountered were the results of incorrect camera handling.  This camera does require some reading.  The camera has a number of scene modes and features that affect its performance.  For example, if you use the night mode, you must remember to hold the camera still longer than normal, as the aperture remains open longer.  If you do so, the pictures you will take will be top notch.  What impressed me most about this camera was the sport mode.  My friend asked me to take a picture of her legs while she was running.  I did so, and the picture came out PERFECT, as if she were standing completely still in a very awkward position.  I don't really know what other people are complaining about with reference to the software.  I have Windows XP Home on my laptop, and the camera setup was easy and quick.  Personally, you may not even need the camera dock.  I was handling fine with just a USB cord.  Only one problem; rechargeable batteries are a MUST.

Here's the story.  Went out to find a replacement digital camera for an older Pentax SLR and Nikon point and shoot that the whole family could use.  Well after seraching high and low and just about every website, I came down to the fact that: 3.1MP is about enough for anyone to make good big pictures; 3x optical zoom is a bare minimum; video and audio are nice features; but most imporatantly if the family is going to use this camera, then it's got to be intuitive and stay under $300.  The choice basically boiled down to the Canon A70 and this Kodak.  Well the Kodak won! It's less expensive by $30 and it's a camera that even complete neophytes can use right out of the box. The Kodak uses real english language and not just miniscule, almost indescernable, icons to get to various functions.  The down side, although only as small as the Canon icons, is that the Kodak does not do VGA movies nor does it allow for attaching a voice file to a picture.  The Canon to it's credit does have a bit more manual controls (if you can remember what those tiny, indescernable icons actually mean). By the time you figure it out - you miss the shot.  The Kodak, to it's credit, is built well and has a nice convienent size.  It also has a nice size display, continuous movie mode with sound, intuitive controls, and EXCELLENT 4X optical zoom which just about blows away anything in the 3MP and less than $300 price group. So... if you want a digital camera that is really very and I mean VERY good, go for the Kodak.  BTW, the printer dock works well (a bit slow) and limited in terms of the size of the prints it makes but for prints that it can do, it's good. You certainly don't need it if you have a good computer/printer.  The printer dock is fun to use and watch just like Polaroid prints used to be fun to watch develop.

It has the easiest and most intuitive controls of any digital I've used. The image quality is very good in all modes and with all quality settings (there are four of them), with the auto mode usually doing a great job for normal point-and-shoot stuff. The PAS mode gives you more or less manual controls -- nothing like what you'll find on a real SLR, but very handy nonetheless. If there's one problem with the picture quality, it's that the auto mode tends to darken the foreground or subject ground of a picture based on small amounts of backlight -- the flash against a white wall alone is enough to skew the brightness. Overall, though, it's a rather minor complaint for a camera that works so well -- two seconds in Photoshop or any other editing program will correct any problems.As I said before, the controls are extremely easy. Anyone can use this camera within minutes of picking it up, even the uninitiated or technologically disinclined. It's too bad that this ease and simplicity of use didn't extend to the software, however. Don't get me wrong -- it's certainly easy to use. The problem is that it turns your computer into a Kodak digicam station. I had to remove three Kodak entries from my startup menu, and the next time I rebooted my computer, I still got a Flash tutorial for the software. It would have been very useful if I had been expecting it. Needless to say, the software isn't exactly my sort of thing, though it does make it very quick and easy to transfer and share pictures from your camera.Overall, the DX6340 is a great piece of work. Its high point is its ease of use -- it really cannot be overstated how smooth this camera is to use.

Special picture settings allow you to take motion, portrait, nighttime, landscape, and closeup shots.The picture quality is WONDERFUL! One of the first places I used this camera was at the zoo, and I came away with some of the best animal pictures I have ever taken - you could literally count the hairs and feather fibers, the images were so clear! It even takes great pictures through glass. I have also been extremely pleased with the closeup setting. One of my hobbies is re-painting tiny horse figurines, approximately three inches in height, and this camera allows me to take very nice, clear closeups of my work. There are also several flash settings, that allow you to turn the flash on and off, use red-eye correction, etc. One feature that came as a pleasant surprise to me was the video function. This camera allows you to take short video clips, WITH sound!I would highly suggest that anyone purchasing this camera also buy an additional memory card with 128 MB (or higher) storage capacity. This will allow you to store well over 100 pictures at a time.The only disappointment I found with this camera was that the software would not install properly on my computer. However, that may be a problem with the computer itself, as mine is more than a little temperamental. I was easily able to circumvent this problem, as Windows XP has a built in function for downloading data from digital cameras, so I just use this method instead. I would HIGHLY recommend this model to anyone looking for a quality digital camera!", "Date": "January 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, great value!", "Author": "K. Parry", "ReviewID": "R28ART206LH3Q0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I have been heckled by our respective families for not supplying nearly enough photos of our 2-year-old daughter.  We're actually pretty good about taking pictures of her.  It's taking the film to the store to get it developed that we have a problem with.  For example, we still have somewhere around the house a roll of film from our honeymoon 5-1/2 years ago that still hasn't been developed.  So for us the convenience of a digital camera was a must.  We put off purchasing a digital camera for a long time, waiting for the price to come down and the features to improve.  When we discovered this little beauty and its companion, the printer dock, we knew we had our latest purchase in sight.  The quality of the photos that this camera takes is more than sufficient for our purposes, and the convenience of being able to use the supplementary printer dock and instantly print photos from the camera is wonderful.The first main event we used this camera for was our daughter's second birthday a few months back.  We took pictures of the celebrations at the restaurant, and of the cake and the present opening at our house.  Then, after we put our daughter to bed for the night, we hooked the camera and printer dock to the TV with the included wires, and did a high-tech slide show for my parents.  As they chose the photos they wanted, we selected them, and then printed them right off.Even without the printer dock this is an excellent camera.  I have a Mac, so my computer instructions may be different than those for PC users, but I just hook the camera up to the computer with the included USB cable, and iPhoto automatically loads up.  For PC users, as well as for Mac users without iPhoto, the 6340 comes with a CD with EasyShare software.  Hook the camera up to the computer, and the EasyShare software automatically loads.  Then import the photos, view and/or edit them, and then save them, email them, or print them on a computer printer using either standard or photo paper.Also, in this price range, the 3.1 megapixels that the EasyShare is capable of is  great as well.  Most of the other cameras I looked at in this price range either did not have such a high megapixel capability, or did not have as many features.  And at the time that we bought this camera there were no other cameras on the market that had such a well-integrated printing system like the EasyShare printer dock.  Perhaps that situation has changed in the past few months, but I haven't shopped around lately.Another feature that I like about the EasyShare is the fact that you can choose different resolutions, affecting how many photos can be stored on the memory card at one time.  On the highest resolution, a 256MB card (not included) would store around 256 photos; on the lowest, it will store upwards of 700 photos.  This is great for day-to-day photos, or vacation photos where you don't want to cart around (and risk losing because they're so dang tiny) several memory cards.Also, this camera has a video mode.  Although many other still digital cameras include a video mode, this is the only one in this price range that includes a microphone, so you can record sound as well as motion.  This is especially helpful during those moments (as we often have with our two-year-old) when there is a fleeting moment to capture and a regular digital camera is far easier to operate than a DV camcorder.  Then simply plug in the camera to the computer, and (on a Mac) iMovie loads up and imports the film.  Emailing the video as an mpeg file is as simple as emailing a still photo.About the only gripe I have with this camera is the high price of the memory cards.  Of course, once the photos have been stored in our computer, we can erase the contents of the memory card, but I'd like to be able to export the photos from iPhoto back to the camera and I haven't quite figured out how to do that.  Since our computer's printer doesn't seem to have photo-printing capabilities, I don't want to delete the memory cards' contents until I have either figured out this issue or printed off the photos I really wanted to print.But all in all, this is a wonderful camera for the price, and would still be a value at an even higher price.

Wong", "ReviewID": "R1TZLED4Q8V7JZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter wanted a digital camera for Christmas.  She has been using inexpensive film cameras for years.  A senior in high school, she is still prone to breaking the camera's battery compartment door after about six months of use a camera and I have to buy her another film camera.  The Kodak DX series cameras all have the same type of flimsy battery compartment door.  The USB cable to hook the camera to the computer is very tiny and delicate.  If you are not gentle with the connector, you could cause damage, rendering the Kodak camera useless.  I bought the $280.00 Kodak DX-6340 digital camera for her to use.  Since the digital camera is so expensive, I don't want to replace it in six months due to a broken USB connector or a battery compartment door.  The Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock 6000 solves both of these problems.  There are already a lot of good comments regarding the DX6340 in this forum.  I won't repeat what everyone already said.  I would say that the best thing about the Kodak DX6340 is its ease of use, but the Kodak Camera Dock 6000 makes the Kodak DX6340 a great camera.  It is true you have to buy special rechargeable NIMH batteries to use the Camera Dock 6000.  Generic AA sized rechargeable NIMH batteries with a generic battery charger costs less than the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock 6000, but AA sized rechargeable NIMH batteries cannot be charge inside the DX6340 camera, therefore you would lose the ease of use with that option.  There is a brand of NIMH rechargeable battery pack made for the Kodak camera made by DigiPower available for $15.00 (quite reasonable, when you compare that to the cost of proprietary batteries for cell phones and other digital cameras) from Circuit City and other fine photo retailers.  Since the Camera Dock 6000 conveniently recharges the battery pack in 3 to 4 hours every time the camera sits in the dock, you never have to open the battery compartment; it would be like charging a cell phone battery.  The battery pack should last one or two years before you need to replace the battery.  If you want to transfer your picture to the computer, you never have to open another compartment door and connect up a flimsy USB cable to the camera.  You connect the same USB cable to the Camera Dock 6000 permanently and forget it.  If you want your camera to last a few years, this camera dock goes a long way to extending the life and reliability of any DX series camera.  I bought the Kodak Printer Dock 6000 with the DX6340 initially and returned it un-opened after I found the cost of printing at the local Sam's Club a lot cheaper.  The Printer Dock 6000 provides the same convenience and provides printing capability at a very steep price.  The paper/ink cartridge refill kit costs $25.00 each time and comes with only 40 sheets of single size 4x6 photo paper with exactly enough ink to print 40 photos.  That works out to be a costly 63 cents per print.  I could get Sam's Club 1 Hour Photo department to print the digital prints for 17 cents a print.  Even the local drug store can provide digital prints for half that cost of the Kodak refill kit.  So I decided that the Kodak printer supplies are too expensive.  The Kodak Camera Dock 6000 on the other hand allows me the same convenience at home to print through a generic photo printer made by Epson, Canon, HP and others at a lower cost using my home computer.  However, I'm very lazy when it comes to photo printing and at 17 cents a print from Sam's Club 1 Hour Photo, I don't have to even do the work.  Just spend five minutes to put the pictures on a CD and take it over to Sam's Club 1 Hour Photo department.  If I want any size other than the single 4x6 size, Sam's Club 1 Hour Photo can do it.  Not possible with the Kodak Printer Dock 6000.  So, I say the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock 6000 is definitely a must have option.  $80.00 is not a lot to pay for the Camera Dock 6000 to get this level of convenience for the DX series cameras, especially when it makes using the DX6340 similar in ease to using a cell phone.

I loved that camera.  Had it for 3 years and abused it.  We stopped at a retailer at 9 PM Friday night to grab something for the trip.  When I found a 4x optical w/ 3megapixels for $300 I grabbed it.  Overall it seems like a good value.  The screen is large, and I like the look and feel of the interactive menu.  I like that it detects when you hold the camera sideways and rotates the thumbnail in review mode.  Not sure on battery life yet, but I like that you can use AA-NiMH rechargables (which I am stocked with due to the Fuji) as well as disposable lithiums.  NOTE: SEVERAL MAJOR IRRITATIONS coming from what I am used to with the Fuji.  1.  If you want to review your pictures stored in memory, you first have to turn the camera on into one of the photography modes - which opens and extends the lens (exposing it unnecessarily, potentially into the palm of the viewers hand, and wasting battery life running the motor.)  2.  The \"OFF\" function is one of the positions on the photo mode dial.  So if you want to take a picture in a mode way down the dial, turn it off, and take a another picture in a mode way down the dial - say if you like manual (PAS) mode which is last on the dial - you have to click the dial through 7 or so clicks each time.  This can delay response to a quick photo opportunity and put unnecessary wear on the mode/on/off dial.  3.  If you want to shoot a picture using the 1.8\" display instead of the peep-hole, you have to go two-levels deep into the menu to turn it on, and then two-levels deep again to turn it off.  I typically shoot using the peep hole to save battery life, but sometimes I need to use the display to frame my picture (say if I have to hold the camera in an awkward position).  Similarly the option for a quick preview is two levels deep on the menu. --- The Fuji had separate controls for on/off, mode selection, review/photograph mode, and display on/off all within easy reach.  So my complaints may be somewhat biased based on my familiarity with my old camera.  I haven't decided whether the specs of this Kodak for the price outweigh some if it's functional design deficiencies yet.", "Date": "September 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "OVER 7,000 PIX  !!", "Author": "Brian Piper", "ReviewID": "R1DD68U481ZPAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera May of 2003 and up until yesterday (Nov 7 2005) I have taken over 7,000 pictures with this camera!

We bought a 64 Mb card when we purchased the camera, and the camera never recognized it.  Retruned it to Amazon and got another - also didn't work.  Returned it and bought a third brand at the local Staples - also didn't work.

Remember, if you don't like a photo just delete it and take another shot if you want to.3)  The DX6340 will suck the life out of ordinary Duracells or Energizers after about 6 shots (with flash). Maybe Kodak can design an high capacity external battery pack which can be slung on one's shoulder and wired to the camera with a simple cable. This battery pack would then make this a good choice to carry for weddings or parties (or other photo-demanding occasions) where one can take 60 to 80 pictures without losing battery juice.4)  If Kodak decides to redesign this camera as a smaller unit, that would be good, too!

So, with the new camera off for service, I was still left without a digital camera for work, so bought yet another new digital camera online.

You need to buy the Energizer lithium AA batteries, sometimes referred to as \"digital camera batteries\" and the Kodak DX6340 will run off of them for a really long time.  This is actually an advantage over cameras with a rechargeable battery in them because you can carry a couple spare AA cells and be right back in business if you run the camera for days on end.  No need to stop your sight-seeing trip because the camera's battery is dead.The Kodak DX6340 has a rotary dial on the back to switch it on and change operating modes.  This is actually a great feature because the camera isn't a \"vampire appliance\".  When it's off, it's really off.  No trickle battery drain.They say the Kodak DX6340 is only 3.1 MP, and compared to all the new cameras touting 12 MP and more, you would think the Kodak DX6340 takes inferior pictures.  Not so!!!  The M550 (one of the crummy cameras I bought trying to replace the Kodak DX6340) takes pictures about half as nice as the Kodak DX6340.The size and feel of the Kodak DX6340 just screams quality.  And, indeed it is a quality product.  My old one had been dropped, wet, hot, cold, and exposed to very high RF fields and never complained.  My new one is operating in hot environments and very high RF fields without a problem.  The M550 crashes as soon as you turn it on!

Once again for all you experts it was not the computer. The next step was to call tech support. After over an hour of troubleshooting, no luck. The best they could tell me then was to try it on another computer, which I am sure that every household has 3 or 4 of. Well we do have two and that didn't work either. So there wasn't nothing easy about the easy share dock. The next day I went out and purchased a multi-slot card reader. It hooked right up and I was finally able to download all 180 of the pictures.

I sent it to Kodak, they couldnt fix it and it wasnt covered under warranty (of course) so I had to pay $150 for a refurbished one.  What was wrong with it? The thin plastic lenscap was jarred.  I've had the replacement camera a few months now and have babied it, it's never seen a drop or jar and the lenscap has started to not retract completely.  Either its a standard problem or they fixed my original and sent it back.
