{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Radio Guy", "ReviewID": "R23D1S3V7LHKBF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have one of these cameras overlooking my parking area and am very pleased with its performance.  Easy to adjust, Night vision is ok and daylight is very good - over all excellent results. It is a good value.I did have problems with the mounting hardware: the metal collar that goes between the camera and the mount was loose and no easy way to tighten.  Had to come down the ladder to get tools (Water-pump pliers) to fix it.  Check out the camera's hardware before you go up  the ladder to install it, and don't forget your hex keys that are included with the camera.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "GW Security Camera 700 TVL", "Author": "wmdshooter", "ReviewID": "R1LG0ZZ4VUCL6N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just finished installing this camera and everything went well. No problems with either the installation or the function of the camera. Picture quality seems to be better than the 600 TVL cameras that I also own. I give three stars because I believe that some improvements are in order with not only this camera but with most of these publicly marketed cameras. I realize that efforts are made to keep costs down and make the product affordable and I certainly appreciate that, but some things just bother me. I don't understand why the housings on these cameras are so big in relation to the working component? Is it an attempt to make the camera appear more robust? The actual working component is not all that big, in this camera it is about 1/3 the size of the housing. Why not cut back on the size of the housing and make the Focus and Zoom adjusters more sturdy and more user friendly. Lastly I would like to see cameras hold up longer. My security system has been up and running for about 18 months and I have already replaced two cameras. I hope this is not the norm.UPDATE 11/14/13 I am removing a star because this camera worked fine for about 3 days and then the night vision mode quit working and finally it just went black. I am returning this to Amazon. This illustrates one of my pet peeves about cameras that are available to the public. There is no way this sort of thing should be happening with the regularity it does. Poor, very poor quality and quality control.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleased!", "Author": "Rawk", "ReviewID": "R33I2265NVBL45", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far so good!
