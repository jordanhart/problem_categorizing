One of the devices, however, had threads that were malformed.  I am assuming this is the case because there was a protective cap over the thread area.  So, it seemed highly unlikely that the threads were damaged due to shipping or handling.I made the supplier aware of the issue with the one device and they replaced it quickly and with little hassle.It was disappointing to get the one bad part, however, the company fixed this shortcoming quickly and to my satisfaction.  I would buy more of these devices and do business with this company in the future.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$3.99", "Features": "The perfect solution for drop ceiling rails!\nT-Bar Clip measures 1.06-Inch x 1.75-Inch (26.9mm x 44.5mm)\n0.25-Inch 20 mounting stud", "Name": "Panavise 863W CCTV T-Bar Ceiling Clip Base (Cream)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31wp0ecSbDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000U8I676"}}
