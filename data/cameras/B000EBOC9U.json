Vrshek \"rob\"", "ReviewID": "REZR1T8MGGI1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally don't write product reviews, but this camera is outstanding.  I have wanted to get into more serious photography but don't want to have to lug around an SLR everywhere I go.  I'd rather have something I can take anywhere.  May get an SLR at some point, but right now I really don't care.My first digital cam was a Nikon Coolpix 880, which had great manual features and excellent imaging/color.  Only problem was the 3.2mp resolution and the fact that I might as well carry around a brick.  I bought a Canon SD450 and took it to Panama.  I was really disappointed.  Generally, Canon photos are sharp with great color.  The camera had washed out colors and was susceptible to some serious blur.  My friend and I agreed that our girlfriends' Canon A400's (possibly the best 3.2mp camera for novices) took much better photos than this one.  Some of the photos actually looked as if they were taken on a video camera.  The battery life was tolerable (about 140 pics) but I decided to take it back and get the Panasonic.The DMC-FK01K takes the best digital photos I've seen outside SLRs.  The colors captured by this camera will make your jaw drop.  It's that good.  I'm surprised at the number of photos I've taken which make me feel like a good photographer.  The stabilization feature helps out a lot with blur, but it won't fix everything.  The video taken with this thing is incredible and will give you almost 20 minutes of 840 pixel-wide resolution (albeit mono audio) video with great detail on a 2GB high-speed SD card.  My friend bought one on the same day as me and told me his is taking some incredible photos in Las Vegas right now.  Knowing how this camera does its job, I would have been willing to pay $450 for it.Rather than do a long, drawn-out diatribe, I'll just list all the fantasic things about this camera, plus a couple of MINOR drawbacks.  I have always liked Panasonic products and this is the best one I've seen so far.  Prepare to buy lots of fast memory (up to 2GB) - it will be worth it.ADVANTAGES:1. Incredible picture quality, particularly colors, with great definition.  3.6X optical zoom makes a big difference, compared with 3.0X.2. Wide-angle Leica lens is great.  3:2 and 16:9 picture modes take great photos and make you see your prospective photos much differently.3. Stabilization prevents most blurred photos (read up on how sophisticated this feature is at leica.com via panasonic.com link).4. Very small - less than 1/2\" wider than the Canon SD450.  The screen sticks out a bit, so you will a screen protector.5. Beautiful design - the flat black body with silver/chrome trim looks very cool, like an old camera.6. Outstanding battery life.  I've taken almost 100 photos and some video, and the battery still shows full.  People are reporting almost 300 photos before recharging.7. Great widescreen (mono sound) video - 2GB SD card gives up to 20 minutes at highest resolution, 30fps.8. Enough near-manual modes to do what is needed (if you buy a small tripod for nightshots - the only way to take night photos, the pictures will turn out amazing).9. Gorgeous LCD screen with a daylight feature and a great mode which allows you to see the screen when you hold it above your head.DISADVANTAGES:1. Image stabilization is not perfect all the time, but is certainly much better than not having it.  Helps a lot with video.2. You can't zoom while you're taking video, so you need to know your shots and anticipate edits.3. Make sure you're careful of the power switch when putting it in your pocket.Move over, Canon.rob", "Date": "April 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "The only small camera with an optical image stabilizer", "Author": "oldsoup", "ReviewID": "R28EF5B4P2L1G4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my FX01 recently from Amazon and have played with the camera for a few hours. I also own a Sony W5. The FX01 is a big step forward from the W5:1) It is much smaller. In terms of volume, the FX01 is about half that of the W5.2) The optical image stabilizer works, to some degree. I took pictures with both cameras, at about 1/15 speed; the picture from the FX01 is sharper.3) Movies from the FX01 are steadier and easier on the eyes because of the image stabilizer.4) The movie resolutions are more flexible: All three resolutions can be either 10fps or 30fps.5) It uses the less expensive SD card.6) It has a slightly wider angle lens (2.8), which comes handy when taking group pictures in a small room.7) It has a bigger LCD (2.5\u201d). However, unlike the W5, the FX01\u2019s LCD protrudes out from the back; a screen protector film is definitely needed.The only thing I don\u2019t like about the FX01 is the proprietary battery. AA batteries won\u2019t fit in the small body of the FX01. However, I purchased two compatible rechargeable batteries from a vendor at Ebay for only $7.99, which should provide ample power for most day trips.", "Date": "March 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Exceptional.", "Author": "B. Lagman", "ReviewID": "RDOA1OMQ9HENW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Didn't really know what to expect given long term relationships with Canon and Sony.  Also, some of the reviews were less-than-stellar on various websites so I entered into purchase with cautious optimism.  Mind you, I am not a photographer, but I am always concerned with quality and wanted a camera that fits my point and shoot needs, but is capable of a little more seriousness if needed.  I would use it for family vacations, family events and to shoot landscapes for email transmission at work. I purchased the camera on a Wednesday and our family left for vacation on the following Friday.  That didn't leave me much time to become familiar with the camera before having to really rely on it.  No problem. Out of the box the camera is fairly simple and easy to understand.  If you've owned any digital camera before, you'll find navigation simple and straightforward. The screen on camera is awesome, large and bright and I found the menus to be logical.  The camera seems a perfect weight as it is not too heavy, but has some heft to give it a solid feel.  The black color is fantastic, it is very cool to look at.  It is small and light enough to carry in a cargo short pocket without bogging you down.  Just make sure you give the camera its own pocket so you don't risk scratching the LCD.  The camera has a very quick response time when you power it on and you are instantly ready to shoot.  At 6 MP it is almost overkill.  I don't make large prints and if I shoot photos at 6MP, they seem so large they are cumbersome to email -many at a time.  Regardless, when shooting at 6MP, my untrained eye sees magnificent photos.  I'm sure real photog guys could find flaws, but to me none were apparent.  Night shots, could pose some challenges, but again, I think unrealistic expectations are part of that.  The flash does not cast too far, so if you are shooting in low light at some distance - don't expect a great result.  I would think a camera of this size will always have similar downfalls.  After reading some reviews I was afraid I wouldn't be able to take quality shots at night.  Not the case at all.  I have some fantastic night images and some mediocre night images that I just don't think a camera of this stature can handle.  Certainly not a problem for me and my intended use.  Image stabilization was noticeably good and the ability to select settings appropriate to the scene was useful. The \"Easy Mode\" allows those without any camera savvy (my 12 year old daughter) to shoot basic photos with ease. The battery life on this camera is stellar.  I bought an extra battery for our vacation and didn't even use it until the third day! Battery life was a big concern in cameras past - but not any more.  One thing that was a pleasant surprise was the camera's ability to shoot video.  Don't get too excited - it's not going to replace your video camera any time soon, but for shooting 30-60 second clips to send to friends or add personality to your vacation album, I was truly impressed.  I shot a video clip of our roller coaster ride.  My wife and son sat in the first car and I held up the camera to caputure their impressions.  Granted, I was jostled and jolted as the wooden coaster took violent shots at me, but the video was surprisingly great.  Perhaps today's cameras on this level are all capable of similar feats, but I just couldn't believe it. Overall, I rate this product 5 Stars.  Maybe it's a testament to how far technology has come in the last 4 years since my last digital camera purchase.  Maybe it's an indictment of the quality of my last camera and how I'd gotten used to mediocrity. I could not be more pleased with this camera. It is ready when I am, lasts a long, long time in between charges, takes great photos, takes great video clips, is small and light, has a wide angle lens, brilliant LCD, image stabilization that really works and sensible menus and settings - what more can I say?", "Date": "July 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Finally the camera I've been waiting for!", "Author": "Ted Shafer", "ReviewID": "R2N06ERK4KS5RR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow I love this little camera.  Finally a 28mm (35mm equivelent) zoom lens in a really compact body.  I've always kept 2 cameras - one little and portable, for quick shots and videos of the kids, and one large and bulky for high-quality, wide-angles, landscapes, architecture, and portraits.  I think I'm finally ready to ditch everything in my camera drawer and consolidate on this little Panasonic.  This camera addresses virtually every complaint I've had about my past 5 digital cameras.Pros:- wide angle lens in a very compact body- very sharp and bright 2.5\" screen - MUCH better than the Canon SD450- great picts- great videos- very rapid response - quick turn-on, quick shutter, quick turn-off- solid construction, feels good in the hand- easy to use - buttons and menus are well thought-out and intuitive- battery life is exceptional- Anti-shake really seems to work- surprisingly inexpensive - more bang for the buck compared to comparable models from Canon et alCons (I'm hard pressed to criticize this camera)- lack of zoom ability during videos is annoying- like most non-SLRs, it is basically impossible to attach filters to the lens (I like to occassionally use a polarizer, and my previous wide-angle camera, the Nikon 8400, also great but far bulkier, has threads that allow you to attach filters)", "Date": "May 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Just What I Was Looking For...", "Author": "Carol C. \"C. C.\"", "ReviewID": "R3UJZHN0AO4EMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After several weeks of online shopping for a digital camera I chose this Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX01. I was looking for a camera to replace my long-time love - a Canon Sureshot, that I'd used for over 20 years! I've had a couple point-and-shoot cameras in between but nothing came close to the great pictures and simplicity of use as that little Canon. I am by no means a professional photographer or techo-wise person, I just wanted a very small point-and-shoot camera to carry in my purse that required little fuss to take great photos of my family doing family things.My layman's opinion of this camera is that for the price (I paid less than $300), it delivers all that I was searching for. The size is perfect for me, about the size of a pack of cards but at the same time \"weighty\" enough to hold on to. I like the metal housing and the black color looks great! Various reviews report the battery life to be exceptional and I find this true. I've gone two full days of picture-taking, transferring to PC, vido-shooting, reviewing shots and experimenting with settings with plenty of battery life left. (My last HP digital camera would take less than 16 picures before crying for more juice....arrrrrgh! so battery life was an issue for me) The control buttons are conveniently placed, except I have accidently turned off my OIS a couple times. Avoiding this problem is just a matter of practice on my part.BTW, the OIS....that is what sold me on this camera! I'm embarrassed to say I was unaware of this feature until I'd started shopping, then I decided I had to have a camera with it. I was all set to buy one of the pricy Canons with IS when I found this Panasonic decided to try it based on reviews I'd read, as well as the great price. My opinion is that this feature is indispensible. Who couldn't use a little help with camera shake? The LCD display is 2.5 inches with brilliant resolution. The menu and controls are so easy to manuver, I'll soon be able to leave my hard-copy manual at home. I especially like the \"simple mode\" which just displays the very basic features for quick point-and-shoot. The more manual settings are close at hand in those situations where I want more control of my shots.More advanced reviews of the 6MP, Leica lens, optical zoom capabilities, 15+ scene modes, etc are also out there but I can just tell you that for my use, this camera takes great pictures and is easy to use.I'll make a couple recommendations for accessories. Get those plastic film screen protectors for that nice big display. They are so cheap and worth every cent to protect it. I also bought a 1 Gig memory card and a semi-hard protective case so the camera wouldn't get squashed in my purse.You'll love the Panasonic DMC-Fx01.

We just had our 3rd child, so I felt she could take better pictures with a better camera.I researched extensively and decided on the Panasonic Lumix FX01. As a bonus, it came in pink....my wife's favorite color.This camera has some great features like the image stabilizer and 28mm wide angle view.  It's also a compact camera (like the SD200) which is a requirement for my wife.  A majority of the reviewers liked the camera...for its size, you get some amazing features.  For me, the biggest selling point was the wide angle lens (a Leica lens) and 6 megapixels.When I got the camera, it was fancy looking....All metal construction with a large screen on the back.  The menus are easy to use, and there's a simple mode for those that just want to point and click.I am meticulous about comparing and testing, so I put the SD200, FX01, and my personal Sony DSC-V1 side by side and took over 100 pictures inside with flash and outside in sunlight.I expected the FX01 to have amazing pictures, but I was actually disappointed.  Some of the shots looked slightly out of focus compared to the other cameras' shots.We take mostly inside shots of our kids with the flash on, and the FX01 did mediocre compared to the other cameras.  I noticed the pictures got very dark when I used the zoom.  The SD200 had some noticeable noise in some shots, but the FX01 was not much better and was worse at times.  My Sony V1 did the best, but this was more of a comparison with the compact cameras.Pitting the SD200 vs the FX01, I looked for good picture quality....and these cameras rated about the same to me. I looked for sharpness and good focus, and the FX01 just didn't impress me.  Of the 100 shots, SOME of the FX01 pictures were better (skin tone and detail), but more were slightly out of focus and dark.  Even with all the fancy features of the FX01, I did not feel completely satisfied that it was a better camera than the SD200 because of the image quality....so I'm returning the FX01 today.I give it 3 stars for its great set of features but only average image quality for indoor shots with flash.  I wanted very badly to like this camera, but after all the testing I finally had to admit that it's not a better replacement to our SD200.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wide angle lens makes up for slight shortcomings", "Author": "A. Butterfield", "ReviewID": "R1X365ERE0HJNH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I also have a 4MP Canon Ixus 400, and a Canon Pro1. My Ixus is getting on a bit, takes forever to focus, has a screen the size of a postage stamp, takes horrid movies and is twice as fat as this Panasonic. The latest Ixus models address all these things, but don't have the wide-angle lens I love on the Pro1.The Panasonic FX01's photos aren't as good, if you look at them critically, as my much older Canon Ixus 400. They come out a (little) bit dull and lifeless, don't look quite as sharp, just don't have the same depth of quality.BUT, the thing is, unless you look closely in Photoshop, or make big enlargements, you're unlikely to see the difference. If you make typical size prints, or view slideshows, you'll be very happy I reckon. And despite Panasonic's reputation for `digital noise', I haven't found it to be an issue (compared with my Canons) up to ISO200, the maximum the camera uses in auto ISO mode.GOOD STUFFThe wide-angle lens is really good for getting more in when you're standing close to something. Don't underestimate how useful this is.The image stabiliser makes a real difference when the light gets low (though I found it doesn't help much if you turn the camera on its side to take a portrait or something).The screen is really sharp, like a mini plasma screen. There's a `bright' mode that makes the screen easy to see in bright light, although you have to go into a menu to select it, and it cancels itself after 30 seconds.Movies are nice and smooth and look close to real video when you play them through your TV. You can take higher res widescreen ones too, but if you don't have a widescreen TV, don't bother because they look worse on a standard TV. I bought a 2Gb SD card and you can get 22 minutes video on it (less in widescreen).It's really, really easy to use. The menus are perhaps even better than Canon's menus. An absolute pleasure to use.Very small, light, slim, stylish, nicely made. Will impress your friends.Battery seems to last quite a long time, if you enable the economy mode.Spot focus mode very useful for macros and difficult subjects. Focusing generally reliable and there's an assist light for dim conditions.Pretty fast to focus and take photos, and fast to switch on and off.Metal tripod mount.The black version (mine) isn't just painted black: the black stuff is grippy and slightly rubbery.BAD STUFFNo optical viewfinder. I still miss that.There's no panorama stitch mode like on my Canons, and no way to lock exposure like on them either, so don't count on being able to make decent panoramas even in Photoshop.No spot metering option.Sometimes I get blurry photos for no apparent reason, like the focus hasn't worked. Doesn't happen often but it's annoying.Despite claiming to use high speed USB 2.0 transfer, if you download straight from the camera to your computer it takes AGES. Use a card reader.The screen doesn't have a surround to protect it. So if you lay the camera on its back, you're laying it right down on the screen.Tiny flash is weak.High sensitivity mode produces paintings, not photos! A gimmick I think.No manual control over aperture and shutter.CONCLUSIONProbably not quite the best ultra compact, though not far off. But it has a wide angle lens and that's the killer because only the hard to find and generally compromised Ricohs have that. If I hadn't wanted a wide angle lens in particular, I would probably have bought a Canon or Fuji.

The reason was that nobody wanted to lug around my digital SLR, even though it was an outstanding camera.  The answer was to buy a good camera that fit into my pocket.After a lot of research, I settled on the Lumix DMC FX01 -- primarily for the image stabilization, the lense quality, and being able to do 28mm.  I couldn't be happier with it.The camera itself is well made and sturdy (with the exception of the door covering the USB connection: it's a bit flimsy).  The display is bright and very easy to read.  The menus are simple, readable, concise, and don't depend on too many glyphs :-)The pictures are great, especially outdoors.  You do have to learn your camera a bit to take good indoors and low-light photos.  I advise experimenting a bit before your kid's birthday party.  Remember that you can reduce the shutter speed very effectively with image stabilization, and that helps a great deal with low-light situations.Image quality is excellent unless you go over ISO 400.  At higher ISO speeds, there's a fair amount of noise in the image.Overall, for a point and shoot camera that fits in my pocket, I'm extremely pleased with the Panasonic.

Something that fits in the pocket, has good battery life, takes good pictures, and can accompany me anyplace and anytime. Other cameras I considered were Canon SD550 and upcoming CASIO EX-Z1000 (10.1Mp).The camera is very well built. It is actually Made in Japan. The LEICA Lens provides the wide angle capability equivalent to 28mm - 102 mm in film cameras. This is a very handy feature for taking pictures in small places, at homes - as most cameras in that space have widest angle of 37mm or more.The LCD display is large and very clear. It is 2.5\" and has 207,000 pictures. For comparison my D-SLR KonicaMinolta Maxxum 5D has 115,000 pixels.The built in antishake mechanism is great. There are actually two levels. The preset scene modes are very handy, and include interesting selections as Food, NightLandscape, etc. I have taken several pictures at nite, with no flash, setting the camera on a table or fence, and they have come up great.The video capture feature is very good and very useful. Capturing film at 30 and 60 frames per second. With this camera I no longer need a camcorder. Although at the highest resolution the camera uses a lot of memory card space - and you need to have a fast second generation card, like Sandisk Ultra II (minimum 1Gb recommended.)The camera is small and fits well in the pocket. The battery life is very good, and the charger is very small, plugging directly into wall - no cables.The picture quality is very good. Pictures taken in good conditions are excellent for a 6Mp camera. The shutter lag is very small, and the camera is capable of taking pictures of active kids.Comparing to the 6Mp D-SLR like my Minolta Maxxum 5D, the pictures come very close. The Minolta with much larger image sensor, and huge lenses and flash takes better pictures, but again, my 17-35 lens alone costs almost twice what I paid for Lumix. The shutter lag on Minolta does not exist, but again, LUMIX is excellent for its class.Pictures taken in low light conditions are reasonably good. ISO-80-200 is good, ISO-400 is reasonable. The flash is good for short distances, say 10-15 feet.Overall, great little camera for taking quality pictures. The next best thing to a D-SLR.

The image stabilization allows great shots in low light (evening and indoors) with little or no flash.  It also insures a much higher success rate than any previous camera in obtaining a usable snapshot. (I've owned 5 digital cameras)  The pictures can be noisy if you leave the \"sensitivity\" set at auto.  I set it to 80 and it works great.  If I can't get the shot I need at 80 then I switch to the \"scenes\" mode and let it automatically set the parameters.  I did this when I went skiing and got great shots in the \"snow\" mode.

I also ran a half marathon with it and was able (with the 28mm lens) to take good self portraits and video thru the entire race.

Noisy pictures in low light if sensitivity is set to auto or above  200  - the noise was never a factor since:  1. I would not have been able to take the photo with most  other compact cameras.  (ie. sensor pushed to the limits)  2. When printed out 4\" X 6\" or less, then noise seems much less  compared to the computer monitor(Both Canon MP500 and Epson 300R)I have purchased 2 of these cameras - The second I gave as a gift to my brother after being impressed with its performance.

What I wanted was (1) a large, hi-def LCD, (2) a standard SD memory slot, as everything else I have uses SD (3) good, non-choppy video with sound and (4) a long lasting, rechargeable battery.  I would have preferred AA rechargeables as these by far have the longest battery life and are easy to find & cheap, but the DMW-BCC12 battery isn't too hard to find or expensive.  Surprisingly I couldn't find all this in any store I looked, and I looked around almost two weeks.As a previous digital cam snapper, my reasoning was that 95% of the pictures I take I never take the trouble to print, and I instead find myself going around shuffing through the LCD and showing them.  That's what has happened at just about any get together or trip I've been to.  I suspect many other people end up doing this too.  My friends also like videos, and videos without sound is a no-no (forget about using their TV and plugging in, carrying cables around, that never happens).  The LCD pictures with 200K pixels and 2.5 size were impressive.My only complaint is (okay, I'm being picky) the small size.  I have large hands and sometimes with these digital cameras I feel like I'm a giant playing with a toy.  But the buttons are not hard to get at or prone to finger-fudging.  And at least as in some models, you don't have to use tweezers.  Why can't they make cameras man sized anymore?  I'm not afraid to carry one around and I'd never put one in my pocket anyway (what this obsession is with camera makers to make them 'pocket friendly', I never quite understood).

Ever since I got this camera I wished there was a cover for the large screen.

I wanted a 28mm wide angle point and shoot, so I bought this because Canon's SD800 IS is outrageously priced.  I'm a Canon fanatic, so be prepared for multiple comparisons.  However this camera is worth crossing over to Panasonic for.PROS - I definitely enjoy the 28mm feature.  The bright rear display is wonderful, the OS is quite intuitive as well.  Also it gets great battery life.  The ~ 300 shot estimate in the specs is pretty realistic.CONS - Compared to Canon cameras this is my conclusion -All of Canon's camera have much truer white balance presets.  Even with RED & BLUE fine tuning options, indoor dim lighting is really hard to do, as is snow lighting.This camera takes much more saturated and contrasty photos than Canons do.  Even when the FX01 is set to be less-vivid, it's way more saturated than Canon's most vivid setting.  The end result is a dramatic and unrealistic photo sometimes.The CCD noise is another issue.  This camera's sensor is much noisier than Canons'.  Nothing dramatic and deal-breaking, but don't expect the same crisp, clean shots a Canon will take.Finally Panasonic image stabilization.  It really does not hold its own against Canon.  I used the 570 IS and handheld shots that were a 1/4 second, and sometimes longer, with decent results.  The same goes for the S2 IS (which I HIGHLY recommend as a digital camcorder/super zoom hybrid).  The panasonic's sensor doesn't seem to match the ISO standards that you set it to, and it wants slower shutter speeds at f2.8 ISO 100 than a Canon set at the same f-stop and ISO.  So, despite the FX01's Mega OIS, its longer shutter speeds mean you still get shake that you wouldn't with an equivalent Canon.I know Canon, Canon, Canon.  Well, I told you I'm biased.  After reading these cons, why would you get this?  It's 1/2 the price of the SD 800 IS (if you shop around) and it's a must have for city photos, big landscapes (skies look so cool with wide angle) and it's vital for indoor group shots!Buy it, but don't expect the world from it.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "First time digcam owner", "Author": "J.

However, for the times when I want to take quick snaps of the kids and the lighting conditions are not ideal (read: most of the time), the fx01 creates images that are either cold and unnatural looking (flash on, but this is kinda normal for this space), or are noisy and grainy (which is not normal).  I found some success tweaking the settings, but I bought this to be a point and shoot camera, not a dslr, and while I don't expect the world from an ultra compact, I think the fx01 should take better pics, and there are many other cameras that do.  I returned it.The noisiness aside, it does have a bunch of cool features.  I don't think I will buy another camera without the wide angle lens, which makes framing shots so much easier.  It has a setting that makes it so you can see the lcd when you hold the camera above your head for a higher angle shot, I could see myself using that on occasion.  It goes pretty quick from off to taking the pic, which is essential for snapping candids of the kids.  Also the image stabilization works.Overall, this camera has all the right features, it just falls short on the images.  Panasonic just needs the fix the sensor to take cleaner pics to be real competition for Canon.  I have read that the fx07 is even worse, so skip that.  The fx30 was just announced, so I am going to wait and give Panasonic another chance (provided that my old s50 stays with me).

In many ways it's a good little camera -- very compact, good zoom (3x), a somewhat wide-angle (28mm) basic setting, which is handy for taking pictures indoors, lots of special settings if you want to use them, shutter lag that's not too bad, and generally good guesses as to the right lighting for a balanced picture. Its video capabilities are very reasonable too.Our only ongoing problem is that many of our pictures are out of focus, and we don't really know why. We are going to try \"prefocussing,\" where you push the button down halfway first, so the camera gets a focus, and you can see in the (very big and bright!) LCD display on the back what it's focussing on, and see if that helps.It seems to have the most focus trouble in lower light conditions. I notice that even with ISO set at 400, it will often slow to 1/8th a second or even slower -- and there's no way we can hold the camera steady at that slow shutter speed, even with the dual image-stabilization/ anti-shake feature it has. So it may be blur rather than focus that's our problem. Some future day when we buy another snapshot camera, we'll see if we can spend more for one with a higher ISO setting (800 or 1200), though that can drive the cost up quite a bit. Of course, we *could* just get a tripod, or a monopod, but this is a snapshot camera, how much of a camera geek do you think we are??If we can conquer the blur problem, this will be the nearly perfect everyday camera, especially for travel.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "My First Cam: A First Great Experience", "Author": "Michelle Hipps", "ReviewID": "R291KY3XBMC6UV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my camera about a year and a half ago before I went to college (UF - Go Gators! :) When I was purchasing my camera I was torn between getting a Canon and a Panasonic, but the Best Buy sales guy that I spoke with told me that the Lumix lens on this camera was very good, better than the Canon I was looking at. He was very right. I have never had an issue with my camera (Panasonic DMC-FX01). It has a very durable exterior (I dropped it twice), has a nice big LCD screen on the back, has easy to use buttons, has many scene modes (like sports, scenery, soft skin, portrait, night portrait, night scenery, self portrait, food, party, candle light, fireworks, starry night, baby, snow, and underwater) You can also take videos with this cam. All your pictures can be stored on a regular Scan Disc and transferred to your computer (unless you would rather use the USB cable, it does come with it). In addition, the battery is long lasting. It has a very nice feel to it. I don't really know how to explain but I'm gonna try... When you hold it, it has a nice heavy expensive feel to it without feeling too heavy. It has taken some very nice photos too. The Panasonic also allows you the option of taking your pictures in black/white, sepia, or warm, cool, or neutral color. I have used this option many times. I'm not lying when I tell you that I've gotten  alot of compliments on my Panasonic.

Thinking back to the SD400 and the photos I'd taken, 2 problems stood out: a lot of the pictures I took were blurry, and often I couldn't fit everything I wanted to in the frame.For the blurriness problem, usually the photos would look good on the camera's built-in screen, but when viewed at their full size on a computer or printed, the blurriness would be apparent.  The obvious solution: optical image stabilization. It's just really hard to hold something as small and light as these cameras perfectly still, so OIS is a big help.For the fit-in-frame problem, sometimes moving farther away is just not an option, and 35mm equivalent starts you off too close. The obvious solution: a wider lens. Unfortunately, that was very rare in pocket cameras... until the FX01.I chose the FX01 because at the time of its introduction, it was the only pocket digital camera whatsoever to combine a wider-than-35mm-equivalent lens and optical image stabilization. This was enough to make me take a chance on a new brand, not knowing how well the controls and interface would perform in actual use. Over the next year, it's turned out great -- there are somethings I've preferred about Canons and some things I've preferred about this, but this camera has taken consistently good (and not blurry!) pictures.One more thing I only learned after the purchase: the build quality (construction and materials) of this camera is amazing. I don't use a carrying case for my pocket cameras, since then it can't fit in my pocket! Instead, I just keep the camera naked in a pocket with no keys or other metal objects, or keep it in a $5 soft sunglasses sack. After a year of this treatment, the SD400 still worked fine but had a bunch of minor scratches and a few missing screws. After over a year of this treatment, in comparison, the FX01 still looks brand new. It bears repeating: it's amazing.The image quality isn't quite perfect (one common complaint is noisy images under low light conditions), but given the tradeoffs necessary to make something this small with all the other features and abilities you want, I'm completely satisfied.Since the FX01 pioneered the OIS+wide lens combination, other pocket cameras (Canon's SD800) do it too; a friend has the SD800 and it's great too.

If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi.So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop.
