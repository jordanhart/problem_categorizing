{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Bundle - everything as pictured", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R10XDGZLFP1PEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything arrived as advertised and in excellent condition, and shipping was very quick.  I will not go over the camera itself, because very detailed reviews about it are easily found.I bought this bundle, instead of buying directly from Canon, mainly because I really needed the SD card, since my previous SLR used compact flash cards.  The extra battery is not from Canon (but I didn't expect it would be, so no problem there).  However, since it isn't a Canon battery, it doesn't \"talk\" properly to the camera, so the camera doesn't display the remaining power level of the battery.  This isn't a problem for me since I always carry a backup battery, but it is worth noting.  The camera bag is very nice, but a little small for the camera when it is equipped with the kit lens (minus the hood).  It just fits in the bag height-wise, but it's too small to fold up the neck strap on the top and still zip it properly.  Wrapping the strap around the lens works well though.  It's a good little bag to carry a couple of extra lenses and such when you have the camera always out though.Overall, this was a great deal for me because of the memory card and extra battery.  I looked at many other bundles that different sellers offered with this particular camera and to me, this was the best one.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E9CA7FS"}}
