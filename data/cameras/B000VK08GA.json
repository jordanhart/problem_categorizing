MCKICHAN", "ReviewID": "R3JCB4O5YU98R5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this several months ago and used it quite a bit (gently) until it broke after about a month or two of use (sensor had trouble with light processing and final photos were bad). Although I found that I had to dig in order to find Kodak's customer service number, once I spoke to someone they were helpful. I did have to pay my own shipping to get it sent in for repairs, but that whole process went extremely quickly. I would give them high markes for fixing what was broken and my three star rating does not reflect any bad feeling about the fact the camera stopped working correctly so soon after purchase.  The camera itself was OK, but not outstanding. I found 12mp looked exactly the same as several of the lower mp choices and about the same as my older 5mp fuji. At least for what I do with a camera the 12mp didn't equate to anything. The HD video mode, which was the main reason I picked up the camera, was only so so. Outdoors it was fine, but did not handle bright whites well at all and displayed a purple streak from white objects. Indoors the video was very noisy. (In fairness though, even mid range consumer camcorders in the $400-$1000 range display noise indoors if you are not using a dedicated light.)Pros: small size, good LCD screen, HD video is better then the 640x480 that most cameras shoot but don't expect anything approaching broadcast quality.Cons: proprietary battery that I couldn't get off ebay yet, digital image stabilization not the equivalent of mechanical, only a 3x optical zoom, pics just average.", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera, at a great price", "Author": "Victor C.", "ReviewID": "RJ6E8PRXNOAYW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to start by letting you know im not a professional photographer, im just a person who wants to take good pictures, and decent video, with one small device that you can carry in your pocket.And that's exactly what makes this camera worth the money, what other camera will give 12mp images, and 16:9 video at 720p, for $180?Yes when you take a picture, it takes a few seconds (3-4) for the image to be processed before you can take another one, so know this, if you want to picture a moving object you better use the burst mode, cause you only get 1 shot.Video is great, and you can actually take stills out of the video, resolution is awesome (720p for a point & shoot!).Other manufactures will offer you great pictures, but horrible video quality, and if you buy a video camera you get great video but 1mp or vga pictures, this bad boy gives you the best of both worlds, on a small handy camera, at half the price.This camera is definitely a lot of bang for your buck", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sleek!", "Author": "Noms Services Ltd \"Noms\"", "ReviewID": "R259BP4KN2T7MR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It was sleek and lovely. The only thing I continue to wonder is why the manufacturers didnt add an AC charger just like in the 10MP. This is funny! I had to charge on my computer. I was lucky I had a G600 printer which I also used to charge. I finally had to order the charger saperately which am using to charge it now. The charger was lovely, as it can be dismantled and fixed again.For videos you want to review on the camera, the camera volume may disappoint you, as it is no loud enough. The image quality is however fantastic. Pictures I taken with this camera have not been a bad idea at all, and the camera's shutter speed is impressive, incomparable to any other Kodak camera I have ever used or come across. The only visible problem you have to cope with is the rate at which pictures blurr. You have to keep your hand real steady to get a clear pic.If you are the type that likes sleek things, this one is definitely for you.I would recommend it for upgrading by Kodak. I also suggest that they retain the shape and improve on my complaints.

The price seemed right, it had extremely high megapixels, and was compact in size. It seemed perfect.Upon reiceiving it, I was immediately wary. It was sluggish. I found that after taking a picture, when I pushed to review it, sometimes it would take 20 -30 seconds to load. Then it would freeze. The pictures were often grainy or blurry. I hoped that maybe with continued use, it might begin to work better- but it didn't. As the weeks went on, it froze more and more.One month after my purchase, it broke entirely. I took it to the beach and kept it in a zip lock bag, and placed it inside a waterproof sling. The next day, it didn't turn on. I sent it into Kodak to get it looked at in hopes of the warranty kicking in. I was charged a large sum for the inspection, then told that there was some sand in it. To get it fixed it would cost a hundred dollars, in which I had already spent 50 for them to look at it.I have a Kodak z760 that is amazing. I had thought to upgrade with this camera. However, my 6 megapixel took far better pictures than this one ever did. Its been very durable, I've taken it to the beach, my sister has dropped it, its been wet, and it has never failed.

My issue with my old camera was the minor graininess of pictures and its poor battery life.  When I initially started testing this camera, I was very happy with it and the preview window indicated some great shots at first glance.  It was not until I loaded up my pictures to the PC that the rain started coming down on my parade.Pictures usually come out blotchy with no real sharpness to them.  Often times in low light settings you will notice distinct red scan lines that ultimately ruin the shot.  If you do not hold the camera poker still, you will have images that are shaken and out of focus.  The saddest part is, when changing to different picture modes or adjusting settings to help correct these issues, nothing is really improved.The brighter spots regarding this camera is its ease of use, light weight, and auto-adjustment feature.  The problem with these conveniences are that the first two aren't biggies to me and the auto-adjustment does not kick in significantly enough to help a shot. Plus it makes my subjects squint their eyes as the green circle shining on their faces distracts them.  At the end of the day, I'm thinking of going back to my old Nikon or buying a new digital camera eventually.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R1F5UCZXO7W84I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I rarely use my camera...maybe about 5 occasions in a year.

For the price and quality this camera has exceeded my expectations. I used to carry two cameras whenever went on vacation or site seeing, handy cam and digital. V1233 has replaced both. I had to convert hadnycam videos to dvd for easy viewing, but V1233 videos I put them directly on my MediaCeter Computer which is hooked to my plasma tv, no conversion needed.

Savannah \"willfindyoubargains\"", "ReviewID": "R1K7UNZVUODZS2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have read the other reviews of this camera & found it odd that the things others are complaining about are exactly what I loved about my Kodak V1233.  I am a photography student as well as an avid photographer.  I received the Kodak Easyshare as a gift & absolutely loved it!  I'm not sure of the exact settings I used, but I thought it took excellent photographs in dark environments, in florescent lighting, and other very poor lighting conditions.  Of course, the pictures were basically perfect when the lighting conditions were perfect, but I always achieved great results even with poor lighting.  It amazed me that I was able to take pictures no matter what the conditions were without changing barely any settings.  I've never had these results with any other camera & have owned many different brands (including Sony, Nikon, Fuji, and Kodak).Unfortunately for me, my son dropped the camera at a birthday party & it cost over $70 plus shipping costs for me to send it back to Kodak to fix because it wasn't under warranty.  I had the camera for about 2 1/2 years before this happened (with no problems I might add).  I then purchased another camera exactly like my old one on Craigs List, but unfortunately for me, the screen was broken by the time I received it.  I thought this must be a sign that I shouldn't purchase another one.  It has always been a dream of mine to own a Nikon camera, but didn't think I could afford one.  I purchased one on ebay (the Nikon Coolpix 10MP) and wish every single day that I still had my Kodak V1233.I develop tons of pictures every month (over 250) and was never disappointed when I picked up my prints with the Kodak camera.I do agree with the other reviews that it is slighty inconvenient that the camera can only charge via a USB port on your computer.  I have a laptop & it takes forever to load & everytime I wanted to charge my camera, I would have to wait 10 or 15 minutes before actually connecting it.  I did end up purchasing a charger online, but it wasn't a Kodak brand and it turned out breaking within a few months (because the prongs on the electrical portion were junk).Overall, I think this camera is great for beginners or for anyone who loves photography.  You have the option of using all automatic settings (for beginners) or you can mess with the settings & find what you like (for more advanced photographers).", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review of Kodak Easyshare V1233 HD Camera", "Author": "Boyd", "ReviewID": "R6MF9IRYHZQTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excelent camera.

This camera is sleek and compact, but it packs a punch. It takes amazing hd videos if that's your thing, with 12mp every picture is crisp, as with all cameras it takes a little while to get use to with the auto focus and all the different settings, I bought a 16 gig memory card and at 12mp it holds 5000 pictures, it was totally worth it because it was only about [...] bucks. I dont like Kodak's software so I never install it. The camera comes with a rechargeable battery pack which is awesome but it only allows you to charge it though your USB port, luckily my V1033 came with a charger and it works for this camera too, so I would probably buy a charger from Kodak if you dont have one.

I'm a sucker for good design, and the 12 megapixel with HD video were features i couldn't resist.Outside, on extremely sunny days, the pictures are excellent. Razor-sharp detail, perfect coloring, ect... but on cloudy days or indoors, the pictures turned out blurry and shaky 9/10 times. Sure there's a flash, but that only works for close-up subjects. Outdoors, when using flash on a subject, say, across the street, the pictures are almost completely black, and wastes battery unnecessarily.Close-ups on things like flowers and stuff are beautiful, but it isn't the best camera for taking pictures of people. You have them pose, you take a picture without the flash, you wait to find the colors are completely washed out. You turn off flash, you take the picture, you wait, only to find the picture extremely blurry. The whole process takes so long that the people you're taking a picture of get angry and annoyed at you.Lots of time, the video quality was better than the actual picture quality with flash off.Mostly, this camera is good, like freaky good.

The picture quality if really good when using the flash and in Auto focus.  You do need a steady hand in order to not have blurry pictures.  My biggest issue thus far is that I CANNOT for the life of me get clear pictures without using the flash.  I wanted to take pictures in a darker setting to get Christmas lights, but the settings such as candlelight or fireworks, or other nighttime settings just don't cut it.  The pictures are grainy, blurred, and too dark.  I also have a 15 month old and it's very difficult getting a non-blurred shot of her at times.If you are into landscape scenes, taking pictures of flora, etc. where the scenery basically doesn't move, then you can definitely get really nice pictures.As for the video, it's not bad.  I haven't had any issues with the sound or the picture.  Both are pretty clear.One other issue I've had is that there have been times where the camera has gotten stuck to where it's not really off or on.  Usually this would happen if the battery needs charged, but when it's happened to me, the battery was fully charged.Anyhow, I rated this three stars.
