It is powered by only two AA batteries, which last only one photo taking and sometimes less.  In  Gateway's defence, they do provide two rechargable batteries with the camera, but that doesn't make up for having to change the batteries daily.I have had the camera only a week and have already had trouble with it accepting the memory card.  At times, it said that there were no images. . . I jiggled the memory card around a bit and my hundred+ images reappeared.  Very annoying!As for quality. . . No, this is no 4.0 megapixel camera.  My older 3.0 camera takes better quality photos than this one.  They tend to be grainy and fuzzy, regardless of settings, and close-up shots simply are NOT possible--despite the macro settings.It does have some nice \"bells and whistles\" with lighting and color options, but that simply doesn't make up for poor quality photos.

I plugged in the rechargeable batteries that came with it, programmed the time and date, and took seven pictures then the batteries were dead. I am not a new digital camera owner. I have the Hewlett Packard PhotoSmart C215xi 1.3MP Digital Camera. I thought that it was time to upgrade to a camera with more MPs so I bought the Gateway 4.1. I took my HP to Maui and took over 150 pictures on one set of batteries on the medium setting. And I couldn't even get 10 out of the Gateway! Pathetic! Put in some Duracel batteries, same deal... got 5 pics when the low bat signaled. My next issue with this camera is picture quality. Took some landscape shots to test the \"scenic\" feature of this camera along with portrait and auto since these are the features that I would use the most. I then downloaded the pics from the camera to the pc *using yet again another set of batteries*. Picture quality at best with the brand new 4.1 MP Gateway was on an equal par with the LOWEST setting on the HP *that was purchased 6 years ago*. Picture quality on all were grainy and poor.

I am kicking myself for buying it. Shoulda followed conventional wisdom and bought a Canon or Olympus instead.Problems :- Battery life : Having been warned about using AA (or Alkaline)  cells, I went ahead and bought 4 NiMH batteries and a charger. Sadly, even the NiMH batteries are not enough to take more than 20 or so pictures, far fewer if you turn on the LCD screen. All the while, I see people with Canons snapping away all day without changing batteries.- Image Quality : Image quality is very poor. Indoor snap almost always turn out grainy or ruined in some other way. Outdoor photos (in bright daylight) come out OK.- Bulky : The camera is quite bulky relative to the competition.I borrowed a (4 year old) 2 MP canon from a friend of mine. The Canon beat this piece of junk on the features that matter to me -  picture quality and battery life.If you're in the market for a camera, do yourself a big favor. Pass on this museum piece.

It was a huge expense for me when I got it (college student, part time worker) and I made a huge deal about getting the best camera for my buck.  Sure, sometimes the picture quality is bad, but I can get that with any camera.  The problem with this one?  The BATTERIES!!!Oh man, the batteries.  How many types have I tried now?  Alkaline, NiMH, rechargeable and not, heavy duty camera batteries, etc.  It kills my rechargeables within 5 minutes of being on (taking pictures or not).  I often will take a couple pictures then turn it off for a minute, then turn it back on since that seems to actually stretch out the life for a little.  The heavy duty ones I have in now lasted for about 10 minutes of \"on\" time.  That, again, is turning on and off to stretch out the time it's on.  If you leave it on straight it will seriously kill the batteries within about 3 minutes.I seriously want to like this camera!  I really do!  But it's just not worth the upkeep at all.  I've gone on several vacations now where I'll bring tons of extra batteries along to keep switching out and the camera will just die on my anyway.  I've missed pictures of birthdays and family vacations and seriously, I just can't stand it anymore.  She is a good camera, she really is, but I can't keep buying batteries that will die near instantly.  I'm sorry to say I have to give this camera a bad review.  I'm sure there are some of this type that come out without the battery sucking problem, and if you have one of those then congrats, you got lucky.

To get decent images from this camera you must have the resolution and compression set at the highest quality memory robbing setting (41 images on a 64 MB card).  Mine zapped a set of 2000 mAh NI-MH before even filling my 64 MB card.  I got this camera used and called Gateway about having work done on the camera due to a focus problem and I was informed that they don't even work on out of warranty products.  I ended up buying a Fuji FinePix 2650and it can take better pictures than the gateway, and the Fuji is only 2MP.  In the Gateway's defense, it does have a lot of manual controls, which mean nothing to me.

Spruce", "ReviewID": "RX440T0O0P5NM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recieved this camera as a birthday gift last summer and it really hasn't been very dependable.  From the very first week it was losing my pictures and finding them again at random (I believe someone else mentioned this as well).  I brought it on a class trip only to have the camera die on me.  I returned home to find that all the memory card was claiming it was empty, though there should have been well over 100 pictures on the card.  Luckily my step dad was able to restore the card and the pictures on it, but the camera has consistently pulled stunts like that.  And yes, with different memory cards, so it's not that.Last month the camera suddenly shut off while I was trying to take a picture with it.  It shut off with the zoom lens still out and even though I kept trying brand new batteries it refused to turn back on for more than a few seconds before shutting off promptly.  I left it on the mainland when I went on vacation and when I got back it started up perfectly with the same batteries it had shut off with.  Go figure.Besides those problems I've found the photo quality to be terrible.  My boyfriend has an Olympus 3.1 MP camera that takes far better quality photos than mine ever has even on the highest quality setting.  It also seems to have issues focusing.  I'll get it in perfect focus and when I click to take the picture it refocuses before shooting.  It could be I'm doing something wrong in that respect, however everyone else who has used my camera complains of the same thing, and I've never had that issue with other digi cams.In short, you'd be better off with a different camera.", "Date": "August 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money- youll regret it", "Author": "A.

Payne \"SEO Director, Tribune\"", "ReviewID": "R1XCQUM1B036EV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a question that all digital camera enthusiasts ask themselves shortly after purchasing a digital camera, but it is one that is not easily answered as there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration.  This review will help to guide you to the best solution based off the characteristics and specifications of the Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera.  I feel I am qualified to provide this information as I was in the memory industry for 7 years but having left the industry a year ago, I can be completely unbiased on this subject.One of the biggest factors to consider is the megapixel rating of this Gateway camera.  Considering this particular camera is generally considered to be a 4MP digital camera.  You can expect to store approximately 32 images on a 64MB card, 64 pictures on a 128MB flash card, 128 digital pictures on digital film of 256MB capacity, 256 pics on a 512MB picture card, 512 images on a 1GB media card, 1,024 photos on a 2GB flash card, and a monstrous 2,048 digital photos on a 4GB card.  These image/picture calculations assume that you are going to utilize the full potential of your camera but won't shoot in RAW mode.  In other words, the estimates are for shooting at the highest JPEG setting available for the Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera.  Understand that they are indeed estimates and can vary based off the actual scene or subject being shot and the amount of light, color variation, detail, etc. in the photo.  You can assume these numbers are accurate within 10%.However how many images a card can hold is not the only factor you should consider before buying this all important accessory.  You should also consider that you may want to use your Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera to take shots of sporting events, wildlife, or even your child's unique expressions.  These moments have a very small window of opportunity to get the shot you desire thus a flash card that has been rated by experts as being a faster card may be something to consider.  In my opinion, it is always best to find a review of a flash card as it performed in your specific digital camera.  Some cameras just work better with specific flash cards do to the software, firmware, buffer utilization, etc. between the camera and the flash card.  Finding an answer to this question is not usually an easy task.  There is, though, a superb website that not only offers flash card reviews but also has an extensive user forum that can answer this all important question for you.  You may want to take a look at dpreview dot com and then do a search for the Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera in the forums area, if that doesn't work just do a search on Gateway and you should be able to find someone that can help you.  I am fairly certain you will have plenty of information to make an informed buying decision.  You may also want to look at their detailed review of this particular camera as well if you have not yet decide on whether to purchase it.Of course one of the next factors to consider is in regards to price.  Please, do not make the mistake that I have made of buying the absolute cheapest flash card.  Take a look at the factors I have mentioned here before you make a purchase.  Think of a flash card for your Gateway camera as an extension to it.  Just as you wouldn't purchase the cheapest camera case for your camera (personally I own the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack but I like the extra room and the backpack style, which may not be your cup of tea) don't necessarily purchase the cheapest flash card either.  Keep in mind that you will use this card every single time you use your camera.  Like I said it is truly an extension of your digital camera.The final thing I will mention is in regards to service.  There are a number of flash card suppliers in the world today.  However all of the flash cards are actually built by a handful (3 - 5) of companies and even those companies only have a few options (2 - 4) regarding which components they are going to use in their particular design.  More or less, the actually hardware inside each flash card is going to be similar but the way in which they utilize that hardware and the level of support they will provide, given there is a problem, are more paramount.  Just imagine going 10 days without a flash card for your camera (which I did) because you are waiting for some company to repair your flash card, or worse yet having it fail and having no recourse.  There are a couple of manufacturers that do very well in regards to utilizing technology and providing customer service.  As of the time of this writing they are SanDisk, Lexar, and Viking.  However check the newsgroups and forums for the latest information as it can be very cyclical and unfortunately can take a turn for the worse overnight.No matter what flash card you decide to use with your digital camera make sure you take the time to take the pictures.  Time flies by fast and having thousands of images to thumb through 5 years from now to remind you of the time that has gone by will be the most powerful investment of all.  I have personally purchased a SimpleTech external hard drive to store my images on (another reason I like the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack as it gives me room to put in my hard drive).  The hard drive combined with the backpack allows me to take my photos with me when I go visit family and friends.  I use PhotoShop exclusively to do all my photo editing and batch processing (a great feature of PhotoShop) and of course make occasional backups to DVD-RW.Enjoy your Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera.  I hope this review has informed you how this camera can be best enhanced by a flash card and the best approach in finding one that meets your specific needs.", "Date": "November 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Worth the price", "Author": "Jessica A.

Now, I was not letting everything stay on to see if I can burn 'em up faster. Yes, like any other camera which uses only two AA's as power you will have to replace that power a little more frequently. Depending on what kind of pics you are taking. THIS IS NORMAL!!!

This is the perfect camera for all us 'snapshot artists' out there that would like to make some really fine shots and not carry a big expensive piece of equipment with us that we can't put into our pockets. It has all of the features of it's competitors and with the 4.1 MP power it really does make fine foto's you can print to any size or send them over the web on email. Again, I am really enjoying mine and would recommend it to anyone. Again also, I carry enough rechargeables with me so 'power' is not a problem and have a 256 MB SD memory chip in it so's I can keep on shoot'n and not run out of space.Try this one. I don't think you will be disappointed!", "Date": "December 22, 2003"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4.0 megapixel CCD\n3X optical zoom/4x digital zoom\n1.6\" TFT LCD for preview and review\nUp to 2304 x 1728 pixel images", "Name": "Gateway DC-M42 4.0 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417SM49ZH8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0000W4MW0"}}
