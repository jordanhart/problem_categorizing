{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome camera. So affordable", "Author": "Antonio Nolan", "ReviewID": "R3V6Z0O52O66K9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is very affordable with great features like 16 Megapixels, 5x Optical zoom, 2.7 inch screen. Very easy to use that I did not need to read the user manual to get things going. Runs on AA batteries. If you run out of juice, you can just buy 2 batteries at nearby convenience stores. Good size. Speaker is at bottom of camera so sound is a bit muffled when recording video. Recommended purchase.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, eassy to use with excellent results....", "Author": "D.

The double AA battery feature makes it hard for me to take this camera seriously. Macro mode is kinda nice. Things get over exposed alot (That happens with a lot of cameras though). I'd buy it for kids/teens ages 10-15 that's about all.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004G8Q5N8"}}
