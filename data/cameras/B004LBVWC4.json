{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT camera. cheap accessories", "Author": "Salfa", "ReviewID": "R24QKXEYM3V12C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I knew about the camera before I purchased it. My mom owns one. The camera itself is amazing. However, the accessories lack quality. The zoom lens works just fine and has amazing range for the price. The card is a lower end brand but is all you'll need unless trying to get the best you can out of the 1080 video feature of the camera. The bag is okay but one of the clips that hold it shut broke rather easy, so be easy on it. The tripod stripped out very quickly so I can't use it with the zoom lens where I need it most. You will need to cut the screen protector to fit the screen. It is a universal protector. The video is good if your a beginner and would like to learn more about how to use the camera's settings properly. OVERALL: Even though the accessories lack quality, I am satisfied with the product. Was worth the money.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Setup for beginners", "Author": "Alan Sprague \"Fixitman\"", "ReviewID": "R3GK79WBWXZC0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never owned an expensive camera before, but decided the kids are growing like weeds and I want great pics now. This kit comes with everything I needed to get going. It took me about an hour to read the basic use instructions, but it was very easy to get going. I need a lot of practice, but used it at two track meets, and the pics are fantastic! I only wish I would have gotten it a few years ago. I have yet to watch the DVD that came with it, but I know that will help quite a bit.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Asavings", "Author": "William McCullough", "ReviewID": "R6E5F18SYASJ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wrote on my first review that my camera bag had a broken strap.
