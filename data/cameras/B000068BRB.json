{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For me, the perfect digital camera", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R2F3FHB9VS3XK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've tried out many different digital cameras over the last three or four years, from Kodak to Olympus to Canon to odd ones like HP. I've tried cameras that cost anything from $150 to $1000. So, when it came time for me to give up my never-used 35mm Canon SLR, I knew exactly which digital camera I wanted to replace it with. A few years back, I tried out a friend's Olympus Camedia camera with the same body as this one. It was only in the 2-megapixel range, as opposed to the 3 megapixels of this model, but I was always really impressed with the quality of picture it took. For a point and shoot digital camera, the shots were just amazing. So I didn't have to look very far before I found this camera, the Camedia D-550. And it's certainly lived up to the expectations I'd developed from using the friend's camera. In my opinion, this is what really makes this camera stand out from its competition: \ufffd It looks and feels like a camera. Some digital cameras go out of their way to be all futuristic and oddly shaped, which I find annoying. I want to be able to hold a camera with my hands, not my fingertips. \ufffd The design of the navigation software is excellent. I've used cameras that go to the extremes of interface design, and I've hated it. I used a Kodak camera once that used menus and control panels that were so big and colorful, it was like it was designed by Fisher-Price. Sure, it looked friendlier to use at first, but when I actually tried to find anything, like how to change the size of my pictures, it was too big and clunky. On the other extreme, some companies make cameras that use a completely bare and technical interface that's impossible to understand. With the Camedia D-550, all of your important tools are no more than two button presses away, thanks to the intuitive design of the interface. If you want to switch to Macro mode, you just turn the camera on and press \"Up\" twice. If you want to change the size of the pictures you're taking, you just hit the menu button and press left on the wheel that pops up, and you'll see a nice list. Not too invasive, not too technical. \ufffd Streamlined features. A few years ago, it became popular to pack as many different things into a camera as you possibly could. Sound recorders! Movie cameras! PDAs! Cell phones! Put everything you'd ever want in one device! I thought this was a terrible idea. If you want a video camera, get a video camera. A still camera can't possibly hold more than a tiny clip, so why even bother? While this Camedia D-550 does come with the ability to take video clips, it doesn't assume that video will be your primary use of the camera like other models sometimes do. The feature is there, but you can easily ignore it. \ufffd Rugged body design. Olympus sells a similar Camedia to this in features and price, but a different body. I borrowed one for a weekend, and was constantly having trouble with the lens that stuck out of the camera body. The lens cap would fall off all the time, and I just wasn't careful enough with it. When I had my 35mm SLR, I just put a UV filter over the glass of the real lens, and didn't worry about scratching it, but you couldn't do that with the other Camedia lens. With the D-550, you avoid the problem entirely. When you turn the camera off, the lens retracts into the body of the camera, and is covered by the sliding panel that's part of the camera body. It's a brilliant design that keeps the lens safe, and the speed of the lens movement is quick enough that it's not annoying. I love that my camera is so tough. Though I haven't dropped it yet, I have the feeling it would survive a drop just fine. \ufffd And, of course, the image quality. Even with plain old point-and-shoot simplicity, the colors are vivid and sharp, the exposure is just right, and the low-light pictures are just incredible, which is important to me as a hater of flashbulbs. The other day, a bird fell down our chimney and got trapped in the upper grill of our fireplace, beyond where we could see. So I stuck the camera up into the fireplace and had someone point a dim flashlight where we thought the bird was, and I got a pretty decent picture of it! The bird ended up getting out of the fireplace and flying out the window just fine, by the way. :-) The macro feature is pretty cool, too. My desktop picture on my computer is a photo of an ant I took with my D-550. People are really impressed that the ant takes up 3 inches on my screen. When you consider all the excellent features this camera has, then realize that it's much less expensive than similar cameras, it seems like a no-brainer. I would have easily paid twice what I did for the D-550, and still felt like I was getting a great deal. This camera is going to last me a long, long time, and I'm loving every minute of it.", "Date": "December 3, 2002"}, {"Title": "Not a bad camera in any respect.", "Author": "Rheumor", "ReviewID": "R2M25070WA6QZS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D-550 is another of the Olympus line of clam shell cameras dating back to the old (non-digital) Stylus models of the mid-80s. In that sense, the design is tried and true and I like it for its compactness and its ability to protect the lens from those with a penchant for losing lens caps. For the vast majority of digital camera users, this camera will meet all of their needs well into the future. The D-550 trumps the recently released D-520 by offering resolution at 3 megapixels, which with some software manipulation (similar to TV line doublers) claims to raise the maximum resolution to an effective 6 megapixels. I've played with interpolation and am not a believer, and I have stated in numerous reviews of other digicams that resolution beyond 2 megapixels is generally wasteful. The question here is whether the D-550 is worth the 50% premium it carries over the D-520. This cost jump is a function only of the increased resolution. This higher resolution can be worse than unnecessary for *most* applications, it can make the camera less user-friendly. Aside from the fact that it raises the initial price of the camera,  operationally it requires greater battery use, usually involves longer lag times between shots, takes much longer to download to a PC and especially prolongs both phases of e-mailing photos (your uploading the file and your recipient opening it). These latter issues are, in my opinion, the most important, as the real purpose of digital cameras is being able to integrate them into the world of personal computing. [note: For those folks whose needs are enlarging photos beyond 8\" x 10\", higher resolution is required] The other features of the D-520 worth noting are its very adequate 2.8X optical zoom *plus* a vaguely helpful digizoom (do not accept digital zooms in place of optical zooms; they are not equals), its ability to operate off readily available AA alkalines (though it will accept rechargeables and these make more sense in may ways), its easily expandable memory (it uses SmartMedia, not quite as good as CompactFlash cards, but close enough) and an adequate number of user-controllable settings, all of which can be handled automatically if you prefer. The only drawback of significance has been slow focus on the Olympus digital cams, resulting in more blurred pics than I think acceptable (and this even with my 700, self-stabilizing model!). Personally, I'd take the D-520 and use the money left over to buy a bigger memory card and some rechargeables.", "Date": "July 5, 2002"}, {"Title": "Even better than the D-510 but still has one flaw", "Author": "Mrmako", "ReviewID": "RJC0XN1Q4AJEL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Camedia line continues to be a great all around camera for the average person to use. I bought this one after using my father Camedia D-510 extensively. It is simply and easy to use, with a basic manual that answers your questions. The onscreen directions are usuable, but could have been better. I havefound the pictures to be quite clear as I expected. It was easy to use on pick up, I only went to the manual occasionally to find specific features or answers. Forget those Mac switch ads: It is VERY easy to transfer your pictures to the PC via a USB cable. They fixed one thing in this regard in that you have to activate the camera when plugged in to transfer.  The older model just drained your battery as it turned on immediately and stayed on. The transfer wizard is useful for transferring to the PC, but you can also just treat this as a removable drive so why switch? The LCD window is great for taking up close shots and looks to be inprovved over pervious versions as well. This is a point and shoot camera and is one of the best at 3.0 MP. It offers everything I need, plus I can make mini movies with ease (no sound). The only problem is the camera lens door! They did not fix this problems! You have to open it of course to shoot, but if you do not open it all the way the camera will not take pictures and this can be confusing for some as the viewfinder is blurry. You must make sure to click it all the way open. I have learned to live with that, but when I am taking shots it is too easy to shift the door slightly back inward and cause the camera switch back to view mode. This is the only flaw, it will frustrate you greatly when it happens, but I have adapted to taking pictures in a way to avoid this.  I had hoped they had fixed the door, but did not.  Either way I love my camera and still recommend the product.

Viewfinder and lenses are protected when the camera is off2) Battery compartment has a lock that prevents it from being accidentally opened (I had this problem with D-520 and Kodak)3) No special software or drivers required (I use Win2000) to transfer data from camera to PC or vice versa (unlike Kodak)4) Amazing picture quality when you shoot outside whether it's sunny, cloudy or it's night. For night pictures you MUST use tripod or place camera on something steady. I'm not quite impressed with pictures taken inside but it's a tough test for any camera and I've not finished yet playing with manual settings. I believe I can get more out of itCons:1) Often when I look through viewfinder my nose sticks to monitor leaving marks (not such a big problem as it may sound)2) Movie mode lacks sound and limited to ~30 seconds. Of course you can have as many 30 sec flicks as your memory allows3) Viewfinder is a bit offset4) No buttons or any other widgets to pick mostly used features like scene or flash selection. You are bound to use menu A LOT which is not the most handiest way5) Useless printed manual. You should read PDF one on included CDTo sum up I would say that I'm really happy with this camera, it already gave me good deal of joy and sense of satisfaction.

I researched it thoroughly and for the features this is a GREAT price. PCWorld also said that it had the best overall image quality indoors and outdoors. This is definitely true of my pictures.One thing it's lacking that I really wish it had was audio with the movies. It's a little heavier than most digital cameras but not much more than film cameras. So carrying around will feel no different. I kind of prefer the extra weight which isn't much to begin with.Don't buy a DC input adapter for it. It calls for 6.5V, center positive but any 6V center positive adapter with the right connector will do.It's very easy to use and wait between shots is minimal on the default setting. It's pretty slow on maximum setting but that makes sense since it has to store to the smartmedia.Don't regret buying this camera at all. btw, for first time buyers like myself, if you don't plan to print much, 640x480 resolution (taken by 1 MP cameras) WILL do.

So far every picture I've taken as turned out sharp and crisp just using the default settings.  Anything to a landscape to a close-up of my orchids has come out just fine.  Pictures I have printed out using an older printer come out looking like real photos (unless you put your nose in the photo where you can see each pixel).  I have to agree with one reviewer about the manual, it jumps around a bit and leaves out key bits (like the camera has to be in the on position to download to the computer, to an experienced digital camera user it is a no-brainer, but to a novice...).  Unlike some cameras it feels sturdy in your hands, not cheap.  Make sure you have a USB hook-up in the back of your computer,  if you have a older computer (5-6 years old) you may not have this feature.

However, this means not getting it when it is the \"latest.\"  I watched the reviews and other info on various cameras for some time.  The D550 was one that I kept an eye on.  Finally, the D550 started falling in price.  The D550 is now available at a number of online retailers for less than $... dollars.  I paid $... and was then able to upgrade to better memory cards and other accessories for the original price of the camera alone.  Now I have a great camera.  For my needs: family photos, vacation memories, birthdays, and the such; the D550 is perfect.  I won't be doing many, if any, night time photos.  I don't need fancy exposures or other pro camera tricks.  I keep the resolutions small for simple 4x6 shots, but it is nice to have the option to go larger.  Once on the computer I can adjust, using various software packages, the image to make it more email friendly.  But, usually, I just post an image at my simple website (hosted by ...) and let the family know to browse on over.  The manual does not show to much other than the basic operations.  But, there are lots of websites out there with great reviews and usage tips.  I have printed most of them and created a binder with all the info in it.  If you are worried about going digital with your photo memories and are confused by all the lingo, hype, and information out there, then go with the D550.

Incidentally, the AZ300 still works!!I recently got this camera because of a newborn on the way.  It's handy to be able to take pictures, review them, and add/erase pictures as needed depending on how pictures came out.  Although I never had a bad picture with my AZ300, the digital camera is one less step that I need to take in terms of picking pictures that I want to develop, e-mailing them, and storing them.Olympus has been known for their fine camera construction in terms of both optics and automatic functionality.  This camera is no-exception.  It allows both full-automatic function with some user-overriding features--not enough to make it a full-blown professional camera, but enough to allow a user to take a good photograph in unusual lighting conditions.  Controls include spot metering, ISO selection (although I wish speeds higher than 400 were available), 7 different portrait modes, exposure control, sharpness, white balance, etc., give users something to work with as well as typical features such as black-and-white picture shooting, etc.The 3.0 MP resolution is more than enough for casual users as well as those who wish to make prints up to 11x14, although maximum resolution setting are recommended for this kind of application.  Utilization of various TIFF and JPEG modes are covered well in the manual -- just remember, TIFF for VERY \"spiff\"y prints!!Word to the wise.  I'm sure it's mentioned already, but INVEST IN RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES.  Although some may lament how AA's are not necessarily robust to handle this type of application, I find it refreshing to know that there is an extremely standard and relatively inexpensive power source that I can use.  And rechargeable batteries certainly make up for their cost in just a couple of charges alone.Also, invest in a 128 MB SmartMEDIA card.  The supplied 16 MB card is good for casual use, but woefully inadequate to store any amount of high-resolution images.  I like using the 3:2 mode so I can print 4x6 images on the HP Photosmart 7350 without cropping or resizing!!!Some negative reviews proclaim something to the effect of image aberrations (\"UFO's?\") that occur during night shots.

It takes good pictures, the Camedia software has greatly improved over earlier versions, and transferring pictures is especially easy using Windows XP (Home version).  One of the neat things about the camera is the ability to let you choose what equivalent film speed you want to use.  The \"faster\" the film (i.e., the higher the ASA number), the less light you need, but the grainier the picture.  I took a few pictures at dusk in the San Diego harbor using an equivalent ASA of 400 and got some terrifically colorful, but grainy shots.That said, there are some aspects of this camera that are annoying.  Nothing that cannot be dealt with, but it's still annoying that you have to deal with them.First, the flash pops up EVERY time you open the camera lens.  I don't know why this is so annoying, but it is.Second, the camera defaults to a HQ (high quality) resolution that is not the best resolution.  You have to change that manually.  The problem is, every time you shut off the camera, it resets to the default setting again.Third, the default setting on digital zoom is off.  Again, you can change it manually, but guess what?  Every time you turn off the camera, it goes back to the default on the digital zoom as well.Fourth, the instruction booklet is skimpy on information.

The down side of using AA batteries of course is the size and weight. The image quality is good to excellent. It produces very good 4x6 prints from Costco or Sam's Club digital prints. 8x12 is probably the maximum one will want to go. At this size, although some resolution and other image quality issue shows, the overall result is still good. At 11x14, the image quality is only ok to decent at close range. It looks better at more than 2 ft away, which is probably the distance most of the people will look at pictures of this size.Speaking of resolution, the 1,984x1,488 pixels only produces 2.95Mpixels, not 3Mpixels is an odd ratio. While is may not sounds like a big deal, it is if you are thinking to get this one vs some of the 3.2 Mpixles camera. The difference in pixels is larger than you think. More importantly, 1,984x1,488 is an odd ratio. Unless you always make prints at home, or crop every picture the way you want, the Costco or Sam's will automatically crop the top and bottom for you! The camera offers a 3:2 mode to \"solve\" this problem. But the big problem is it reduces the resolution to 1,984x1,312. Either you use the 3:2 mode or your crop it yourself, the effective resolution dropped to 2.6 Mpixels!! If 4x6 pictures are what you use the most, you should think of this camera as a 2.6 Mpixels instead of 3.Like others have mentioned, the flash is not designed that well. It pops every time because otherwise it blocks the optical viewfinder. BTW, you need to use the LCD viewfinder for the 3:2 mode. You cannot tell exactly what image area with the optical finder with 3:2 mode.The color is very good but the contrast level is a little too high. This problem becomes visible when you print it at 8x12 and very visible at 11x14. The white balance under sunlight or flashlight is quite good. Under other man made lighting conditions the white balance is less than ideal.Would I buy this camera had I known how it actually works?

It is easy to use and the panorama feature is great. I also like the 35 mm format option that can be selected. It would be nice to have a better zoom. The 2.8X optical zoom is good and is mainly useful for framing. Most of the 10X zoom is digital and I found that if you zoom much over 3X the pictures loose their sharpness. The size is perfect and the appearance and quality is excellent. I was only interested in the models that had the sliding door over the camera lens, so I sacrificed the zoom quality for this feature. I found the instruction manual to be lacking. There are features that the manual does not address, like how to make a panorama, and how to download to your computer. This information is in the software that comes with the camera but they could mention in the manual that one can basically use the camera like a drive on your computer. You don't really need the software to get the pictures to your computer. My only real complaint is with Olympus support. When I loaded my software, I could not run the Camedia Master 4.0 on my Imac because it required a serial number that was supposed to be on the sleeve but it was not. I got the run-around from tech support. They said they would send me new software but did not. I persisted and finally received the software, but it took nearly three months to get it and countless communications with some individuals that had no communication skills and in one case barely spoke English. I was disappointed in the software because it did not have \"slide show\" as the earlier versions did. To get that you have to pay for a $20.00 upgrade. In my opinion that is just a \"rip off\".

This camera is a good compromise.Excellent photo quality, good battery life. The use of standard-size batteries gives flexibility; when you are travelling and cannot recharge your rechargables, you can just buy some AAs and stick 'em in. A big advantage versus the Nikon Coolpix 3500, which was my main comparator before deciding.The Nikon though is slimmer, with that intelligent swiveling design for the lens barrel. Olympus could not slim the 3500 down and maintain enough depth for a good zoom. Slimness is a big advantage when slipping the thing into your pocket! Like into a ski jacket for example.But the Nikon costs more...Another reason I finally chose Olympus.We've had it for four months and are using it a lot - just took mountainside shots flying over the Alps - crisp and clear as could be. Action shots skiing also turned out great. With 3 megapixel image size, you can easily crop out the unnecessary parts of a photo and still have enough quality for a good sharp picture containing only the part you wanted.

Most images are too small to read without a magnifying glass. Biggest problem, and the telephone techs seem to have no answers, is trying to attach photos  to e-mails. I have a new iMac, with OS 9.2, but none of the pdf. manual instructions work when trying to transfer to a folder.If e-mailing photos is your main interest, do research this problem before committing.

I am very disapointed in the software that you HAVE to use with this camera. I upgraded to the \"professional\" edition, but it's still bad. It does not alow you to back up your photo's onto CD. (Floppy Disk Only, which is worthless). Also I have pixels dying on my viewing screen.It is difficult to manuver through the options on the camera. Also uses a Smart Media Card, which the new ones do not use, and very few new camera do use, so I'll be stuck with $200 bucks worth of Smart Media Cards when I decide to chuck this thing.", "Date": "February 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "It Survives", "Author": "matthew j pope", "ReviewID": "R1PW95T8177AOS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "O.k., I recently purchased this camera and haven't had a chance to really put it through its paces.
