But when I read all the critical comments I was beginning to feel I made a mistake.Some critics claim that certain features were missing in the H9 that were listed in the specs before the camera was released. No doubt, that's not cool.  Also, I haven't figured out how to set ISO levels. Probably I never will because the H9 insists of doing it for me. And then there is the lack of  RAW storage.I have all these features  in other cameras I own. And although it's nice to know it's all there if I want it, I have to admit I don't use these features all that often.As other bridge cameras with advanced features, the H9 caught the attention of many people in the upper segments of the market who then were dismayed to discover its technical parameters.On the other end of the spectrum, the H9 may be a bit too sophisticated for the point-and-shoot crowd to take full advantage of what it is capable of. The fact that the manual is almost unreadable doesn't help.Now to the good part: 1. I haven't had that much fun with a camera in a long time. The H9 is light enough to accompany me almost everywhere, and I get a lot of terrific shots that I used to miss out on because I didn't feel like dragging around my heavy equipment. Because it is a super zoom,  no shots are lost because I  have to change lenses.2. The macro function is nothing short of sensational.3. I have been able to take amazing shots with the lens all the way out to 480.4. The H9 is fast - no shutter delay and super fast storage of images5. No matter what I throw at the H9, it seems to handle it beautifully. I am sure I will figure out its limitations  as I go along and learn to respect them. The more I get to know this camera, the more it grows on me. 6. The large semi-flexible  screen is a real plus, particularly for candid shots.Well, as this generation of  super zooms go, the plusses more than outweigh the minuses.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Features galore", "Author": "John Wolever \"vernonite\"", "ReviewID": "R3MAOSH0TDHQVT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received DSC-H9 from Amazon 1 week after ordering.  Included 2 GB memory card.After about 4 hours for battery to charge I was taking pictures.  The manual that comes with camera is not very good (37 pages), there is a much better manual (137 pages) available on the supplied CD.  Following are my notes:1) Must take battery out of camera and move to charger, rather than charging directly in camera.2) Remote only works from front of camera within about 15 feet, needed is wireless remote that would work from 50-100 feet, in any direction.3) Memory card did not fit my \"11 in 1 reader\", however the card (SanDisk Ultra II, 2 gb) came with adapter which provided compatability to one of the reader slots.4) It took awhile to figure out the lens adapter, initially the hood attachment did not align correctly causing black framing on picture when wide angle.  I later discovered that the knurled ring can be rotated for proper alignment of hood (not mentioned in instructions).5) The LCD tilts but does not rotate to allow display from front of camera for self pictures (yet remote only works from front).6) Flash tries to pop up, with left hand finger in the way, it takes awhile to train the left hand finger to avoid pop up cover.7) Tried HD mode, colors too vivid for my DLP, changed color mode for less vivid color.  This makes good HD images, however the color mode change does not apply for normal automatic setting.8) No movie files played to HD TV, skipped over MPG files during slide show.9) Slide show interesting, includes music and transitions.10) Cannot edit picture files and copy back to memory card.  Displays FILE ERROR.  Online chat with Sony technical support confirms.  OK to store on PC and copy back if not changed.11) Interesting non documented feature that HD TV displays same as live camera LCD.12) No audio for stills.13) Movies are only 640 x 480, with HD capability I was expecting better.14) Guide says \"Your camera is designed for use under the temperatures between 0 C and 40 C (32 F and 104 F). Shooting in extremely cold or hot places that exceed this range is not recommended.\"  I should not use this camera during June - August in Phoenix, AZ since normal daytime temperatures exceed the recommended range.The first impression of the DSC-H9 was that its very lite almost flimsy.  The name plate for ZEISS stating optical zoom 15X and another stating 1080 HD stills are just stuck on the camera body almost temporary.After a weeks practice trying most of the functions, I am very happy with the camera.  It is very fast, takes excellent pictures, has options galore.

It has a couple of downsides. But the speed and features more than make up for it.Of course most people's first question is: how good are the pictures? Pictures by the DSC-H9 are outstanding. Going through the menu is a little involved, but the auto features work very well getting you good pictures anyway. If you carefully scrutinize the quality of the photos, they are not quite as good as some other cameras in the same price range. It seems the \"superzoom\" cameras like this one, sacrifice a slight bit of quality to the higher powered zoom. But whether this is a problem is debatable, because a 15x zoom can get a closer shot than a 10x or 12x, and you get your better picture that way. As other people have reported, there is also some purple fringing in some photos if you look closely. but wierdly, it shows up in certain shots but not others, and I can't see what the reason is. The fringing is also more noticable on the LCD screen than in the actual pictures, because the LCD screen runs with the color values turned a little high. I've taken loads of pictures with it in the last couple weeks and only noticed the fringing on two photos.The camera is also the fastest I have ever had. Less than two seconds from power on to shoot!Now to address the allegation that \"sony lied\" about the compression settings. Nowhere on the box or in the instructions does it say it has compression settings. Apparently, some early advertising put this out. Most likely, it was a planned feature that was dropped before it was released. Many people expect that Sony will put out a firmware update to take care of it, but that's no guarantee. So, the issue is simple. If selecting different compression levels is important to you, then don't buy this camera. This is really only a problem with a few types of photo editing. But for over 90% of camera users (like me) it will not be important.The included software has a load of extra stuff, although I had no use for it myself.The night shot feature sends out an infra red light that lets you take pictures in the dark, although they are of course in B&W.; In total darkness, you won't see much unless you are very close to your subject. In semi-darkness, however, it works great.Pros: 15x Optical Zoom lens, VERY fast snapshot time, big bright LCD screen, remote control, lens hood, night shot feature, tilt screen.Cons: No compression settings, purple fringing in some photos, non-intuitive menu, tilt screen doesn't twist to front for self-portraits.Overall, for the price great mid-range camera for people who need something more than a compact digital, but are not ready to spring for an a professional level SLR. People who take a lot of night pictures will love it. The combination of the high zoom and fast action would also work great for people who take a lot of photos of wild animals or sporting events.Edit, on July 2010: After having this camera for a couple years now, I simply haven't seen \"purple fringing\" in any more photos at all. Oh, and getting close to my 10,000th photo with this thing, and it still works perfectly.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Alexis Razon", "ReviewID": "R2D21HKN7N3XOC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had the H9 for almost a month, and I've had it replaced once from Amazon, thinking I had a faulty camera. But after reading professional reviews and taking photos myself, I can but only conclude that this camera is not for me. It has great features and all but it hasn't lived up to my expectations. Some people may appreciate it, but surprisingly many people are in the same situation as I am--unsatisfied.It's issues include excessive noise reduction, color aberration, purple fringing, and too much compression to name a few. Notwithstanding the fact that Sony indeed posted a misleading feature--Fine and Standard setting for JPEG compression. The Sports Mode is also pretty much useless since you can't manually change the shutter speed, which is only 1/60s by default. Most of the time, I use the Manual Mode, which is fine if you have ample of time to take a shot. But if you are in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a shot, you can't rely on the Auto mode of the camera. I really was able to take nice clean shots at ISO 80 up to 100. But beginning at ISO 200, I observed some noise; although most megazooms like these suffer the same sickness.As amateur as I am, I learned a lot in photography from tinkering with this camera. That's a good thing if you're new to photography and you want to learn more than just pointing and shooting. I really think the H9 could've been a blockbuster if were not for the Image Quality issues. Truly its features are many of what prosumers want from a camera of this class. However, well at least for me, I still very much consider the quality of the images a camera produces--all other features are bonuses.So what will I do with my spare 2GB MS Pro Duo? Buy an H2. That camera has been tested and admired for its image quality output. I don't think I would be needing extra features of the H9 (except the LCD, that is) so far as the H2 is concerned.The bottom line is this: If you feel the H9's extra features outweigh its compromise in Image Quality, then go for it. People who do appreciate H9's IQ and have $480 to spare are most likely those who will never do prints larger than 4x6\". But if you're like me who pixel peep and crop once in a while, you better look at something else for your money.(Google for reviews for an in-depth knowledge on the issues I have mentioned here.

The body is nice and compact, but not so small that it's hard to hold on to. I love to be able to have a solid grip on my camera to ensure a more steady shot and this camera is designed nicely for this purpose. The Zeiss lens is great (in my opinion the only lens worth having).The camera's menu is easy to navigate and very intuitive. I was able to take some nice photos without ever looking at the paper manual.The 15x zoom is amazing - of course it gets tricky without a tripod when you go all the way out there, but the image stabilization is a live saver!Battery life is not as long as I would like (but who wouldn't want a battery that lasts forever and a day). On the other hand, the recharging does not take very long at all and I am going to get a second battery as a back up.The other gripe I have is the cover of the data transfer portal. It is somewhat in the way when you try to connect the cable to the camera to download pics, but I guess I will have to get used to this.This is a great camera for people that want a little bit more out of a camera then just point and shoot,but are not into the serious photography stuff.Overall I highly recommend this camera.

I wanted something to give me great shots of wild flowers as well as rard birds, butterflys, and streams. Also wanted the MPEG movie for capturing fauna in action. This one does it all and does it very well. It is just about the right size for carrying on my 2 1/2 hour jaunts in the wilds. The steady shot makes capturing moving things easy and with manual setting and can blur the motion. When I get home I can put together a complete slide show with music that wows the family; all on the camera. The large LCD viewing screen is a winner. It rotates out for low angle shots and gives me a great sight of what the shot will look like. I like the view finder for long shots of birds and the viewfinder also shows me the view as I zoom. The LCD does get a bit messy from nose prints or finger prints but I carry a pack of screen cleaner to take care of that. The battery life is more than sufficient and easily recharges. I use 2GB memory sticks and never lack for space. I did order the soft cloth carry case and this is great for getting my camera to and from the field with no hard knocks.

I was VERY please with my H2.  It produced fantastic shots.  This camera doesn't even come close.  Also SONY LIES in their description (down further in the review).First off, the camera is strange in your hands.  It leaves such little room for your fingers.  On the H2 I have plenty of room to place my fingers and manipulate the controls.  The tilt LCD seems flimsy and could easily be broken.  It also is stupid to have a moving LCD if you can't twist it.  Its good for getting above and below your eye level and thats just about it.Also, the EVF is hard to use in the sun, and you smudge the LCD constantly when you try and use the EVF.  The older style allowed room for an eye cup which is a MUST with an EVF.  The LCD is non useable in the very bright sun.  The ONLY saving grace is that you can tilt it down to shade the sun, but if you are trying to get something at ground level from your waist area by tilting the screen and its bright out FORGET IT.  So if the lighting is midlight to dark everything is useable, if not its worthless.Here is the second bummer.  Sony has switched from using a normal sized ring on their camera.  So everything went from a 58mm size ring to a 74mm (which is a nonstandard size). So Sony again like they typically do, stuck with their OWN products (much like they do with the memory sticks). It is SOOO much easier to find 58mm products, and at more resonable prices.  As far as I know the Canon line is sticking with 58mm.  Smart move by Canon.  Stupid move by Sony.The other bummer is the size of the adapter and hood that you now have to use with their camera.  ITS HUGE!!!!  This ruins the entire concept of compact SLR like camera and ruins the entire balance of the camera.  Its odd and strange. It also makes hooking up something like a telephoto lens unstable. I know they had to do it because the lens in the camera is larger than previous models but COME ON!!!Next on my list is the battery system.  I can understand why Sony did the change to a different type battery, the flash does recharge faster.  There are some differing results with the battery chargers depending on how you use the camera.  If you use the EVF and not a lot of zoom you will get about 800 shots, but if you use the LCD and zoom a lot and go through the menu then you get about 400 out of one charge.  I still like the tried true method of using AA's.  Sony should have gone with 4 instead of 2, and stayed away from again THEIR line of product.  A replacement battery is about $50 and chargers for your car or rapid chargers are about $100 to $200, if you stick with Sony.  There are a few off brand chargers out there but... who knows what you get.  They are considerably cheaper, but its my opinion you get what you pay for (hint, hint).Bokeh is WORSE in the H9 than the H1/2/5.  I know this has to do with lens quality, but yuck.  Its too detailed and distracts you from the item of focus.EVERYTHING is located in the menu.  You have to go through several menus to get to everyday use items.  It makes it rather ridiculous, and you will lose shots if you are constantly trying to manipulate the menus.  In my opinion the way things were in the H2 were far superior.The H9 is considerably lighter than the H2, but it is almost to the point of feeling cheap.  I don't like it at all.  I liked the H2 because it was \"just right\" in the weight department.  The H9 does come with a remote, which is fantastic for taking shots you want to be in, or if you don't want move the camera by pushing the shutter button.  The camera also featuers better movie modes than the H2, but they stink compared to a camcorder.  If you want REAL movies of your family buy a camcorder.  The nightshot is kinda cool and does pretty goood, but the shots of course come out in black and white.  If you have a HD monitor its kind of neat to be able to see the shots on that, but if you are like the majority of Americans you don't have an HD TV set.. Yet.So what about picture quality?  The picture quality is good.  However, here is WHY SONY LIES!!!  The camera does NOT have a fine setting for compression.  This is ULTRA important if you plan on doing any type of editing.  It also impacts the picture quality at the higher megapixels.  There is a compression issue as well that makes the picture quality even worse than their previous lines.  This leaves you to the post processing nightmare.  Sony so far has done NOTHING about it!!!  They themselves DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SETTING IS!!!!!  Their engineers can't figure out what went wrong.  Dunce.  Thus the 8megapixels are WORTHLESS!!!This is not the only complaint I have about this camera.  It has significant problems with in camera processing. I think this due to the use of their Bionz processor.  It leaves color distortions and smearing.  It also has soft edges and a barrel distortion like no other (wide angle shots of buildings are horrible, the buildings look like they are curved).  The DRO is worthless and should be taken off the Sony line of cameras.Sony was trying to be innovative but I honestly think they failed. This camera is not worth the price tag and needs work.  They should have never tried to cram more megapixels on a tiny chip and then try and make up with it by using horrible in camera processing.  They should have quailty tested it better than they did.  Now they will either have to issue a firmware upgrade if the issues are software related OR they will need to issue a recall if its hardware related.  My thought is they have stopped sending the cameras out as they are not available through their website (out of stock) and trying to maybe fix the newer models, but I wouldn't buy one of these cameras for a while until the issues are corrected.If you are coming from a point and shoot with no optical zoom and very little megapixel or quality, you will think this camera is the bomb.  However if you come from another good quality ultra zoom you will be VERY disappointed.  The new Canon S5 is coming out and they stayed within the sensors capabilities and added a HOT SHOE.  Buy either an older H series (H2 is honestly the best out of the bunch, for IQ) or get a Canon (either the S3 or soon to be released S5).You can also find clearance H2's at several stores at a VERY discounted price.  Great camares with NONE of the problems mentioned here.

There is the tilting display, 15x zoom, 31mm equiv wide angle, nightshot, even a remote control. It uses the same processor (Bionz) as the Sony Alpha DSLR, supports dynamic range and has a complete new menu and control system. Other new features include face detection and predictive autofocus on moving objects, higher ISO performance and faster burst mode.All well and good. But what really matters is the image quality of the camera, and thats where there are some serious issues.The H9 no longer supports 'Fine' or 'Standard' mode of image quality. The option to select image quality is totally missing from the camera. Although the specifications on the original announcement, as well as some Sony websites do mention this as a feature on the camera.The H9 stores 8MP images at 3 bits/pixel compression while the fine mode of H5/H2/H1 stored images at 8 bits/pixel.There also seems to be color blotches, noise reduction smearing and water color effects that shows up in some images causing a lot of details to disappear.The image processor decides on its own when to kick in these horrible effects in any image and usually it happens in the low contrast/light colored areas, like eyebrow or hair of people, grass, building roofs etc.Many early H9 owners have been trying to contact Sony support to find out why the fine picture mode is missing, and if there would be a fix available to this. There has been no answer to this either.Also, in automatic modes, including the scene modes, the H9 will not allow you to set ISO or white balance, and it also seems to adjust color balance in Portrait mode to get the skin tones right. As a result, many indoor images are taken at ISO 400 which shows clear loss of details, and often the white balance/color balance gets it all wrong. Since we can't set these in automatic or scene modes, the only option to consistently shoot good photos is to use one of the manual modes.Many people called Sony without any success because the tech support doesn't even seem to understand the problem.We loved the H series, and it will be a shame to see such an excellent product line suffer due to Image Quality/Noise Reduction/Compression issues.If you are considering to purchase H9, it might be a good idea to visit Sony camera user forums such as the Sony Talk Forum [...] and see what other H9 owners are dealing with.I do own it and I sincerely hope that Sony will release a fix for the Image Quality.Otherwise this is an excellent camera and I will gladly return here to mark it 5 stars once this has been resolved.By the way, the H9's Image Stabilization is much better too.", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Click_One \"r5\"", "ReviewID": "R37Q5EOLLKOFYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a lightweight camera that has a full set of adjustable functions.

So fast for a P&S; camera!* Improved Autofocus - very fast and accurate.* ISO100 - 3200 - in my experience, anything above ISO400 was not usable.  Noise at ISO400 was pretty noticeable, so I stayed at 100 and 200 mostly.  It was nice to have the option though.* 1/4000s shutter speed - needed ideal light but again, nice to have the option.CONS* JPEG Compression - 3 bits / pixel when using 8 MP, it increases to 4 on anything lower.  Previous models used 8 bits / pixel.* Bokeh - wow, what a disappointment.  The bokeh on the H1 was so nice and much of the time it's downright awful with the H9.  The \"watercolor\" effect may be from compression but I'm not convinced.  Even pictures without the watercolor effect have bokeh that looks horrid.* Filter size - Sony's way of sucking more money from consumers, c'mon!* Battery - Retails for $50 - $60 per battery vs AA prices, it's insane!* Build quality - Didn't like all of the plastic but that did keep the weight down.* LCD Coating - the LCD was a fingerprint magnet, investing in a microfiber cloth would be a must.In the end, I decided to sell the H9.  I bought it thinking the image quality would at least be the same as the H1 and in my experience it was not.

I went to the stores and checked the camera out when it was launched.. inside out to the best of my knowledge. In my opinion, many of the bad comments are true. Still I wanted to buy it since I thought I can live with those bad things. by the way, there are many good things too that I liked (why would I buy it otherwise).On top of goods and bads on this Sony, I had made up my mind to buy a Sony since my canon (S1 IS) broke down in less than 2 years (CCD problem) and another Canon product I had (ZR90 camcorder) was also broke down in less than 2 years (CCD problem) and I had not bought any extended guarantees.Finally I got the H9 one week ago and voila? nope.. shot few pictures indoor and copied the images to a computer. Looked them up, it appeared fine when in 25% view. But, the original view of the picture is so bad.. noisy, obscure, grainy, whatever term is used for it, it looks like a smaller image is digitally enlarged like in a image viewer.Picture is not sharp. So grainy. I had the 8M pixel setting by default and took the pictures in Auto mode.Later I took some shots under the sun (it started shining in Texas last two days!), and images are just a little better and no where near good quality.So.. fellow cameramen/women, what I see is what is expected out of this Sony in terms of image quality..? Or, am I missing something?I compared with the images taken with Canon powershot A540, Sony DSC-T1, Canon Rebel Digital XT, and Canon S1 IS, I am sooooooooooo disappointed to see the image quality of Sony H9.What I see as goods..1) How quickly the camera gets ready for shooting from being switched off2) 31mm equivalent at wide angle3) Light weight4) Good Flash5) large LCD6) Many other features that I have not tried yetBads..1) Not quite handy to hold (may be because I want to avoid scratching the LCD)2) 74mm lens size, not so standard.3) Battery type, not so standard.4) No power adapter comes with the camera to connect to power directly5) LCD is so large that our fingers rub it every time we use the camera.6) Lens hood is pretty large7) Strap holders are like ears to the camera (does not help the camera being a compact)Like I said earlier, I can live with all these bads.. but I can't keep the camera if the quality what I see is what it delivers.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony DSC-H9", "Author": "John D.

I though I would really enjoy the S5 as it is made by a company who is known for its cameras.  But after further review realized that for this compact camera that Sony would be better having come from a camcorder background and it really shows.  Although, for the SLR Canon makes a wonderful camera.  The H9 is more user friendly and has nice menu layouts.  As well as continuous shooting, the next shot delay is quicker in the H9 than the S5.  The internal ISO on the H9 is also much higher which allows for better lighting in low-light situations as well as it's night shot feature and giving the flash range 10 feet more than the S5 at only 23 feet.  Also, the Canon software has been known to have problems as it also did on my computer, yet another drawback for me.  The Sony software had no problems.  Although the Sony does have a date feature, it has to be added to each picture after download and not date printed as the picture is taken.  You can also choose what color and where you would like the date printed, which is a nice feature.  The S5 has a couple of features I will miss however, a feature called \"stitch\" that mends your pictures together for a panoramic photo and a record button on the body to start recording a video at any time during any mode.  The H9 has video but you have to turn the dial to that mode.  Both cameras have zoom and audio on video.I would recommend the Sony H9 to anyone who is embarking on photography as a small hobby.  This (compact) camera is a nice transition from the point-and-shoot to a more sophisticated SLR.

The grip is sufficiently large for a sturdy and comfortable handhold.The Sony H9's most impressive feature is its 3-inch articulating LCD. It's hinged from right under the electronic viewfinder window by a unique L-shaped bracket that allows the screen to come out and swivel to face either 90 degrees straight up or 90 degrees straight down. Unfortunately, you can't use the H9 to take a self-portrait, as you can with some other swivel screens, because it doesn't face forward.Start-up time was pretty fast, and although it doesn't match that of a DSLR, the Sony H9's shutter lag was minimal. There wasn't much of a wait between shots, even with the flash enabled, and continuous shooting was effortless.The 15x zoom was responsive and moved smoothly through the entire focal range. Autofocus was good in both bright light and low light situations. Sony's Super SteadyShot optical image stabilization, an absolute necessity with such a powerful lens, also worked well.Like many of today's digital cameras, the Sony H9 is equipped with automatic face detection. It works well to identify, focus on, and expose the faces in the scene.The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H9 more than met my expectations. The 15x optical zoom provided a better-than-average wide angle starting point of 31mm (35mm equivalent), which resulted in extra flexibility since you could easily go from shooting a distant subject at the telephoto end to shooting landscapes. I was particularly pleased with its macro capabilities and the H9's continuous shooting speed is fast enough to capture action shots with relative ease.The DSC-H9's Aperture priority, Shutter priority, and Full manual exposure modes will meet the needs of those familiar with cameras, and its Full Auto, Program, and Scene modes can help those who aren't.", "Date": "October 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony GREATNESS AGAIN", "Author": "W.

I don't know the reason, but there are two main problams with the image quality: the images tend to be blurry and the images are not sharp. It seems that the stabilization is not effective and the expusere time tends to be very long. Even when getting very simple pictures (portrait of someone who sits and not moving) the image is blurry. The only case I managed to get decent (but nit perfect) image is when I shot in very fast shutter speed, which I had to set manually. Anyway, even the good images are SOFT (which is a nice word for not sharp) and noisyTo sum this update - I am not pleased with the camera! Since I used it a lot I cannot return it, so probably I will keep it (anyone wants to buy?). It is not that bad - you can still get nice pictures and the features are great, but if you start to look more carefully at the pictures you will be very unhappy! On the other hand, before this camera I didn't care that much and it is this camera that made me feel that I want more professional pictures. So maybe it is a good camera after all...- All the accessories are unique. The USB/TV connection, the memory stick, the lens, the battery and so on. And you must buy a memory stick and it is really recommended to buy an extra battery. Thefore you will have to spend more money to buy them (I would recommend to buy one of the kits with some accessories from the beginning).- If you just want press and shot camera, this camera is too fancy for you. On the other hand, if you want professional camera this camera is not good enough for you.- The large screen is great, but it is impossible to avoid touching it.- The IR Images are very noisy. If you buy it for the IR, you should look for another camera. For me the IR option is only a gimmick.UPDATE: After playing around with the camera and buying the extra lenses (wide-angle and tele) I want to emphasize my second point - this is not a camera for professional photographers! It is a hassle to use manual settings and most of the time I play only with one parameter. The extra lenses are very heavy and huge and not easily installed. You must have a serious tripod in order to use the lens. My mini tripod is not stable when extra lens is installed.Now for the good things. It is a great camera for someone like me who is not professional photographer, but still wants some freedom. Great zoom, great pictures, lots of options. After the first set of pictures I learned how to control it. The camera is lighter than I expected.Bottom line - I really like this camera!

The ergonomics fit the camera lens right into the palm of the left hand with most controls set to the right hand control. The \"grip\" is well design and fits easy. The large bright colorful LCD screen is easy to see but I notice the battery use was heavy with me exploring just about any button or menu item I found.Motion pictures no problem MPEG-1 or 2 with the lens zoom fully functional while recording just like a fine SONY CAMCORDER. Even Night-SHOT features.I could probably ramble on about the sharpness of the image, the excellent Zeiss lens with 15X magnification but all those facts are listed above. . . I took the Amazon advise and purchased a 2 gigabit memory  card , as well as a spare battery and extended service plan.If I were to say any negative note it is\"they should always place a ac power cord in the box.\" SONY has it available as an accessory.  With two batteries I think I can hold on that but I will spend the fifty dollars for a 74mm multi coated protective filter for the camera.

With the quality automatic modes I can still operate the camera without too much difficulty while wearing gloves. This may be more difficult for those with large hands - mine are slender.With all the features packed into this camera, I hate to leave home without it because it's ready to go in mere seconds and multiple images of a subject is easy with little delay.

The first few pics were a bit awkward but I adjusted to it almost immediately.  I have had to use a hood lens with a magnifier on my H1 due to my very limited eye sight, but with the Large and sharp LCD on the H9, I don't believe I will need too.I think anyone that is not expecting pro quality photo from a point and shoot will love this camera.

The changing of the filter size from a standard 58mm to a non-standard 74mm is just irresponsible at best...and a poor marketing decision at worst.  To do IR photography, you need to use an IR filter.  The Hoya RM90 is the best, at 900nm, to produce what you need.  But you only have the options of holding the filter there yourself, (while trying not to bump the camera since the shutter speed is so slow in Nightshot), or buying an adapter ring, to go from 74mm to either 77mm or 72mm.  Nice idea, and you can get them cheap on Ebay...but for those filters, THEY COST MORE THAN THE ACTUAL CAMERA.  Yep.
