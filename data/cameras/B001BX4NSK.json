Haynes", "ReviewID": "R3I6TH4UVEGVX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera 6 days ago, and though I had a Canon with many more features, this one beats it because it is user friendly for ANYONE, and it takes fantastic pictures!  It takes shots of my 2 year old neice running or walking, my dogs in motion, low light, daylight, has easy buttons to use that even I can understand (and I'm not good with electronics) and can do many things I may never want to do.However, the Kodak EasyShare Software is a joke, and I agree with all of you who have complained about the \"EasyShare\" software that comes with the M1063, but--GOOD NEWS. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO INSTALL IT INTO YOUR COMPUTER TO GET THE CAMERA TO WORK! If you did install it, UNINSTALL IT, AND CALL KODAK. All you have to do is call the Kodak toll free number 1-800-235-6325, listen for option to \"put in a 2 digit code\", in this case the option number is 20 and wait for a customer service rep to come on the line. Simply explain to her (I called 2 times before I got a person who knew what she was doing) but just tell them you'd prefer not to use EasyShare software and ask them to tell you how to just download photos from the camera into My Pictures, or wherever you want them to go. In my case, I wanted them in My Pictures so I could use Snapfish online services, and voila! within a few minutes, the camera was working and installing photos from the camera into My Pictures AFTER I UNINSTALLED THE EASYSHARE SOFTWARE. Had it not been for that woman, I was going to return the camera today 3-24-09. Folks, you DON'T HAVE TO USE EASYSHARE SOFTWARE, but I can't explain how to do it--they know at Kodak how to make this happen, though and don't even use it themselves! Just keep calling until you get a person savvy enough to help you, because it can be done. They'll take you places you've never been before on your computer, but they do know how to do this.", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera.

The zoom feature is amazing!  The pictures are great quality even when zooming all the way in.

It takes good quality pictures and I'm especially pleased that the flash doesn't seem to wash out my indoor subjects quite as badly as my previous cameras did.However, the software is DREADFUL. A fault of Kodak's recent home use products is that the software is often geared towards the latest, highest-tech systems and most people simply do not have the fastest, newest, biggest computers available in their homes. On anything else, the software takes a very long time to start up and even the so-called \"one touch\" download (which is actually a several-stage process) takes an interminable length of time to fetch the pictures from the camera to the hard drive. It took over 20 minutes to download 48 photos (mostly shot at 5MP), which with my old camera/software (Sony Cyber-Shot with Picture Motion browser) would have taken 3 or 4 minutes. I also couldn't do anything else on the computer while the photos were downloading; whether this was a memory overload problem with the computer or whether the EasyShare software requires the computer to be dedicated solely to itself during downloads I don't know. Finally when I first installed the EasyShare software, it overwrote some of my DSL modem's files and I had to repair my internet connection.Overall I think I am going to be very happy with the camera but I'm very frustrated with the software. I am looking for alternate download software to bypass the Kodak EasyShare software completely for the initial transfer from camera to hard drive.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "A sleek and attractive piece of garbage", "Author": "K. Tevald", "ReviewID": "R16TUEJ3VM0IZP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "***BEWARE THIS CAMERA***I was looking for a decent camera to stick in my backpack this summer while I hike along the Appalachian Trail. I chose the Kodak EasyShare M1063 10.3 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom because it is small enough to pack easily and it had all the features I wanted.The camera arrived VERY fast. I was pretty excited. I couldn't stop looking at it while it charged. It is a beautiful , sleekly-designed unit with a very solid feel to it.I had read all of the reviews on Amazon about this camera, and while I noticed a few were bad, the vast majority were good, and I felt confident that I had bought a good camera.Finally it finished charging and I couldn't wait to take some pictures. So I hiked up nearby Cedar Mountain and took a 10.3 megapixel picture of the town of Newington. The 8gb memory card I ordered hadn't arrived yet and the internal memory is only large enough to store 1 picture taken at 10.3 megapixels so I headed for home. I was very pleased with the camera's menu and functions. It is very easy to use. The picture I took looked great on the nice sized digitial screen on the back of the camera.I couldn't wait to get home. At 10.3 Megapixels I should be able to make out my friends houses. I was anxious to see exactly how much detail would show.A feeling of excitement made my fingers fumble a little while I was plugging in the USB cord.I moved the picture to my hard drive and opened it up ready to say WOW.........I couldn't believe what I saw....The picture I just took was large but the quality of it was a freakin' joke. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.I couldn't believe it. No name brand company would sell something this bad. The other negative reviews I read crept into my brain and I started to worry......I decided maybe I had done something wrong, so I went thru the instruction booklet very thoroughly. The instructions are very poorly written and offer very little about the cameras actual usage; however the on-screen help menu built into the camera is fairly comprehensive. After making sure I had the right settings I went out to the front yard to take some pictures.I tried every setting from 10.3 megapixels to 1.3 megapixels and I tried all of the different light and color mode combinations and soon I came to a realization that really bummed me out.....This camera is incapable of taking good pictures.EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE CRAP AND IT IS SO BLURRY AND GRAINY AND BAD THAT NO DETAIL AT ALL SHOWS UP.This is not my fault, my hand is steady and the cameras blur-warning confirmed this by flashing a little green hand. (which means my hand was very steady)I was looking at one of the 10.3 MP Pics I had taken of my frontyard, the grass looks literally like a child scribbled with a green magic marker. there is no detail whatsoever.This camera is especially frustrating because the features, the design and the digital screen are all TOP NOTCH.......THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT TAKES PICTURES THAT LOOK LIKE THEY WERE TAKEN FROM A CRAPPY CELLPHONE.This is my second digital camera, and my second Kodak. It will be the VERY last Kodak anything I even consider for purchase. This camera is so bad it is offensive.I know there are a lot of good reviews and tho I cannot understand how anyone can be happy with this piece of garbage I want to warn you that this camera takes AWFUL pictures.I have never returned anything that I have purchased thru Amazon before. I do not even know what the return policy is.......But this thing is completely , totally and utterly WORTHLESS, so I am hoping I can send it back......DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK LIKE I WAS.

I already own a Kodak easyshare Z612 which takes beautiful, high detail photos at only 6 MP, but I was looking for a more \"pocketable\" camera because the sheer size of the z612 keeps me from taking my camera with me and taking as many photos as I'd like.  So, I went with the M1063 because of it's slim design, it's array of features (scene selection, HD, etc.), upgrade in MP's, and it's PINK!When it finally arrived, I immediately started snapping away...only to find that on the on-camera screen, the pictures didn't look very sharp at all.  In fact, many of them looked grainy...some looked dark (as if I hadn't used a flash)...and unfocused.  I also noticed that the \"face detection\" technology never really seemed to pick up any of the faces I was trying to take pictures of!  I thought maybe it was just the little screen and things would look better on my monitor, but once I uploaded them to my computer, they only looked worse.  Magnified to 100% and you can really see how unfocused and grainy the pictures really are!  Now if 6 MP was detailed, I certainly expected 10.3 MP to be SHARP...but I find that these photos are LESS DETAILED than my 6 MP photos!  Take a picture of my cat with the z612, and you can see each individual hair...use this camera, and it's just a confusion of black and white fur.  The only photos that seem to come out decent are ones taken within an arms length; beyond that, it's a mess.If it weren't for the mere fact that you can enlarge these past 4 X 6, I'd say I can take better photos with my iphone.

With this camera, I find that i have to pull it out, then find the button, then turn it on. Its just a poor design by Kodak.Video quality isn't great, and the sound picked up by the mic is pretty bad.The interface for deleting pictures is awkward too: you have to press the delete button, then move the cursor up to select that you want to delete the picture. after it deletes the picture, it takes you to the next picture and asks if you want to delete it as well, when it should in fact just take you back to picture taking mode, or a plain preview mode.sorry for the long negative review, but i really am disappointed by this one.

One month later after it had been \"fixed\", the same problem again occurred - it would not turn on. I sent it to be repaired again, and was sent a new camera in the mail.

I'm often amazed that my little camera can take such clear pictures and it's been very fun to have.The shooting modes are great and the video is very clear. However, I've noticed then when I'm taking a video the camera lags bit. It's hard to describe, but when I move the camera it takes maybe 1/6 of a second to show the move on the screen. It hasn't been a problem for me at all and I really don't mind it, but I thought I should mention it.Occasionally I end up with dark pictures, but most of the time that's due to the lighting conditions. No matter how expensive or amazing your camera is, you don't typically get good pictures in bad lighting. It's just a fact. The outdoor pictures are fantastic though.I've had no problems with the battery life, and I don't really have to charge it all that often.One thing that I don't like are the buttons on top of the camera.

(the first thing i did was remove the battery and sd card.)  i took a blow dryer to the lens, that was the last to dry off.  i had to do that several times before the lens would remain clear, before it would not continue to fog up.all back together, that was months ago and the camera still works perfectly.i am not a man to put belongings in cases.  that is why i do not purchase cheaply made items.  i use them.  abuse them.  there are scratches on the lens and dings on the unit.  i have dropped it plenty of times and even gave it a swim in cold coffee, and this unit stands up the way i expect it to:  completely and without disappointment.  i recommend it to the casual memory collector.  it shoots black and white, high color, natural color, low color, and sepia.  you can change the pixels in use to conserve sd card storage, and you can designate the type of shot you want to capture--landscape or up-close or motion or daylight or cloudy..also, this unit has a max card capacity of 4gb hcsd/sd card.  so dont buy an eight or sixteen gig card and expect to use that in full function.  though, with a 4gig card at max settings, this card will capture almost two thousand pictures.  i shoot several times in order to try and capture perfect individual shots and deal with the editing later, but even in akumal, mx for a full week, i only took six hundred photos.  that's not a whole lot, but it's also not a few..  a two gig card--for a thousand picture--is all you need and those are very cheap now too.  so this camera, in my estimation, is a great investment for the casual family or home shooter.  economical and versatile, you cant ask for more.( except maybe a viewfinder ha )p.s.-  i think i'll add a video review later.  though a bit grainy for a \"480p\" video feature, the vid functions well in favorable lighting.  outside, too, though if there is wind present it will remain present in the home vid.  though, i can only preach that if you are in need of a camera AND a camcorder, that you purchase both.  camera home videos are often not as clear as the desired effect sought.  that's my take...", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "D.

You really have to buy a SD chip though because the camera does not have much memory of its own. Pictures are great.

The picture quality is horrible, I compared it with pictures from my old 5 MP camera and the old camera's pictures are better. I doubled checked that I was shooting in 10 MP mood...but 10 MP don't mean anything when the camera lens is so bad.My old camera was a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX8, this was a great camera because of the Leica lens. I'm going to stick with the same brand, like I should have done in the first place!
