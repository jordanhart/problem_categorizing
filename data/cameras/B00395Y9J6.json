{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another winner from Panasonic!", "Author": "Dennis Hawley", "ReviewID": "R2WED8LNSOMWE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't profess to be an expert on digital cameras; my many years of photography involved mostly 35mm film cameras (primarily SLRs and boat loads of accessories).  I purchased my first digital camera about 7 years ago (an Olympus Camedia C-4000Z, followed by a Lumix DMC-Z20, both of which still perform like new).  However, these cameras are somewhat bulky and don't lend themselves to carrying around to catch spur-of-the-moment shots.  Wanting something small and easily carried in a shirt or pant pocket, I began my research.I was somewhat disappointed to find that many small, ultra-compact digital cameras from some of the best known brands (Nikon, Canon, Olympus and others) really didn't have great reviews from users, at least those in the sub-$200 dollar range (which I was targeting).  Having been impressed with my first Lumix, and seeing many high marks bestowed upon a number of Lumix compacts and sub-compacts, I narrowed my search to that brand.When I noticed that Amazon was running a special price on this particular Lumix that had the features I was seeking, it was easy to make the choice.  Receiving the camera after only a few days from order, I immediately bought a 2gig SD memory card (although the camera itself will hold 40mg of images, which is not much), read the manual a couple of times and began shooting.  I was impressed by the quality feel of the camera, and liked the fact that the lens (that great Leica quality is a big plus) has a retracting cover.  As I expected, the quality of the photos (from fully automatic functioning) was top-notch.  I took various indoor shots in different lighting conditions, and then I took it outdoors and clicked off dozens of photos, all the while trying various adjustments available.  One can change the sensitivity (ISO) from 80 all the way to 1600 if desired.  Color selections include normal, natural, vivid, black & white, sepia, `cool' (a bluish tinge) and `warm' (a reddish tinge).One can set the picture size from 4000x3000 (suitable for up to 16\" X 20\" enlargements) down to 640x480 (for email attachments or web photos), as well as 4000 X 2248 for 16:9 display on a high-def television or computer monitor.  As with most other digital cameras, other settings can be adjusted as well (i.e. white balance, red eye removal, , etc.).Although it came with software (imaging and a PDF version of a more advanced manual than the paper one supplied), I was unable to load it in my PC (apparently my `service pack' needs to be upgraded).  Undaunted, I  simply took the card out, inserted into the computer's card reader and presto, pulled the pictures up, and saved to a file (the camera came with a USB cable to allow direct connection to a PC or hi-def monitor too).After fiddling with photo transfers a while, I then took numerous shots using the 5X optical zoom (most digital cameras in this price range only have a 3X optical zoom).  The zoom action was smooth and quick, and images showed no distortion.  I was able to photograph a pileated woodpecker from about 50 feet with the zoom maxed out, and the  resulting picture was worthy of framing.  Lumix's `Mega Stabilization' feature works great; I took a pic of a cat jumping and caught it in mid-air without a hint of blur.The camera also records video with sound; one can select from hi-def (720p) down to QVGA (four setting options available).  I recorded a few video segments in hi-def of a few minutes each (it will record up to 2 gigs of hi-def video).  Playing them back on the camera yielded fantastic quality; when I showed the videos to people, their jaws dropped over the image quality.  However, it is worth noting that while one can play back smooth video on the camera, playback on a PC or hi-def monitor will result in a jerking, fragmented playback (sort of like a video downloaded from a dial-up modem) UNLESS a `class 6' memory card is used (most SD cards are class 2, fine for photos but not for big-screen playback).  While I intend to get a class 6 memory card, I didn't buy this camera to use as a camcorder, so this is not a big issue for me.  It should also be noted that it is not possible to use the zoom feature when recording; while it would be nice if it did, I was aware of this prior to buying it, so obviously it was no show-stopper.A few more points; the rechargeable battery comes without a charge, and it takes about 100 minutes to fully charge (a charger is included).  I've had the camera two weeks now, have taken about 300 shots and 4 short HD videos, and the battery still has some charge left.  The time from one shot to ready for another is about 2 seconds.  The camera's small size (3.9\" by 2.2\" by .9\") makes it easy to slip in a shirt or pant pocket.  I keep mine in my suit coat pocket during working time, but use a small padded case attached to my belt at other times.  I can whip it out and have it snapshot ready in less than 4 seconds now!I really can't identify anything negative about this camera, with the single exception of the inability to zoom while video recording.  Unless that is important to you, then there is no reason not to seriously consider this excellent little camera.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little snapper!", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R344D79A0OBNPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera on a recent trip to Thailand. I have a Lumix FZ28 that I LOVE but it is somewhat cumbersome to carry around so I wanted a little \"snapper\" I could whip out easily on the spur of the moment when something funny happened in a bar or nightclub or I wanted a quick snapshot of something happening on the street or whatever. It was important to me that the camera be small and not a pain to carry around. I did NOT want to spend a lot of money since I already own a great camera so this little Panny seemed, at first glance, to fit the bill nicely.First off, for these perpetually whining types who only seem to write reviews to complain about what a camera DOESN'T do and how it pales in comparison to their SLR's etc, lets clarify what this camera actually IS first of all.The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1 is a camera designed with simplicity in mind. There are NOT a lot of advanced functions. You have normal shooting mode, Panasonic's acclaimed, amazing Intelligent Auto mode, (makes it hard to take a bad photo- seriously!) a bunch of pre-set scene selections and video mode. In normal shooting mode, white balance, ISO and focus modes are pretty much all that can be adjusted. In Intelligent Auto mode, it's even less. This is a camera designed NOT for advanced photographers that demand maximum control over their photos, but for normal people that want to take great photos with a minimum of fuss- the kind of people that wouldn't know (or care) what aperture priority mode means and are not interested in spending days or weeks pouring over their cameras instructional manual to learn all the advanced features it has. The kind of people that want to unpack their new camera and start snapping straight away! On this level, keeping in mind it's target audience, the camera succeeds.What you DO get for your modest amount of money is a compact, well built little camera from a TOP manufacturer featuring a 12 megapixel sensor, a 28mm wide angle lens, 5 x optical zoom, Panasonic's tried and proven \"Mega optical image stabilization\", lightning fast auto-focus, focus assist lamp, the ability to shoot high definition video with sound and outstanding picture quality for a VERY reasonable price. A few years ago, a camera with these features would have cost a small fortune, now it can be had for peanuts and you will be thrilled with the quality of pictures it takes as long as you are not expecting something that will give your SLR a run for it's money!Anyone in the market for a cheap snapper, who does not demand a great deal of control over camera settings but still insists on excellent performance and image quality should give this little gem some serious consideration. Panasonic has created yet another winner! Five stars.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Affordable compact P&S; with bright wide angle lens.", "Author": "Tekon", "ReviewID": "R2H8XXCS68P0DQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've purchased this compact point and shoot based on the description of descent specifications & low price($100.) Although I like Canons, I've had 2 that malfunctioned in less than a year, so I decided to go with Panasonic this time. It has a bright wide angle lens, which I figured would handle low light well. And the 12megapixel hopefully would catch less noise unlike the 14mega pixel ones(the more pixel crammed in the same amount of space, the more prone the pixels are to heating up, hence creating noise... bunch little red/gray spots that shows up)I've had this camera for about a year. It has it's limitations, but it's still a fun one for the price.Pros:- Great deal for the price(unless you wanna spend 400 on a Canon S90)- Great lens, it's wide, and bright.- It's compact. fits in my pocket without too much bulge :)- Takes widely available and cheap SD cards that fit into most laptop's card readers... instead of obscure unpopular formats(expensive Fuji's xD, or Sony's memory sticks, which aren't used by other manufacturer, so when you switch brands, they become useless, there goes the investment...)- It's customizable depending on shooting needs/environments.- Good macro shots, provided you can stabilize the camera well enough(Either with small Gorilla pod, or by resting it on the ground/or something immobile.)- It records movies surprisingly well even in dimly lit places(provided you can keep your camera steady)- Good battery life.Cons:- The slide power switch, moves easily when I slide it into tight pouch(I got the MountainSmith's Cubik S, and that problem is solved. Before that I used to leave the camera on \"playback\" mode in case it turn on by accident, so that the lens doesn't accidentally protrude)- The setting on the camera sometimes needs to be adjusted quite a bit to get the right kind of exposure. In the film days, it was much easier... But this goes for any camera nowadays, even advanced DSLR needs to be set properly.- It's not that great in low light, it seems to come out grainy if I try to shoot without flash by bumping up the ISO. I think going beyond ISO 400~800 turns the image too grainy and then the details are lost. So if forces you to get close so that minimal details are lost. So aside from all the nit picky complaints, when it nails it, it does it well. I found that playing with EV+ & - exposure compensation can do a lot to set the moods. And the manually set white balance is quite accurate. It doesn't compare to a D-SLR, because that's not what it is. It's a point and shoot at a fraction of the cost. 5% of the cost to be precise! A bargain it is! If you take the time and get know you camera well, you'll get plenty of use out it. If you're more serious: You wanna enlarge photos 4ft wide or more to show in a gallery get a film camera with the best film and lens you can afford and take fewer shots. 2nd hand SLRs can be purchased for even $25~100, good lens are still expensive, but they really do make the difference.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great value - excellent product", "Author": "Jennifer L.

To make sure I asked my friends who are more serious about photography and they confirmed this was a good brand and line.  The camera was really put to the test on my trip to Hawaii.  It passed with flying colors - I was able to get the best pictures I've ever been able to take.  I'm not that experienced with taking the time to make sure the shot is right but this camera and all its features makes me want to learn.

Amaral", "ReviewID": "R7QDJ1HKTH42R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So, I do have professional experience with high end cameras, and have also reviewed and retailed point and shoot cameras.Personally, I've owned a couple point-and-shoots and the favorites have been, Nikon and Casio.  Though I've reviewed and liked a couple of older Panassonic's, I'm a bit disappointed at this one.... truly, I expected more from Panassonic.- great telephoto range:  nice wide angle and quick zoom to 5X.  In spite of a decently open lens, light just doesn't seem to make it's way in.  You don't have to go to too dark of an environment to notice lost of noise....- Okay if you won't crop you photos.... if you want to crop them afterwards... well, forget it.- Nice compatibility with SD cards (including the newest technologies - up to 64Gigs)- Standard/GOOD size camera body, considering a good larger lens.- Good battery/charger.. good lasting and quick charge.- Flash is well diffused... unlike a lot of pocket Canons.... I like that.  It doesn't reach very far though... but nice enough to take evening pics of friends at a restaurant/bar if you don't step more than three or four feet away... beyond that... noisy again.- Lens in pretty nice so I think the noisy problem is software related.... even in some very bright pictures, I'll notice way too much noise if I zoom in on a picture at all. (What's up with the software, Panasonic???  That should have been the easy part!!  The physics of making a good small camera should be the struggle.)-  Too many megapixels.... (this is a deceiving number ... the bigger number advertised does sell more!! quality actually goes down.... too many little cells crammed into small sensor size... so they catch less light)... maybe that's the problem with the noise.... 6,7,8 Megapixel cameras are not nearly as noise and you can still zoom in a good deal as well as enlarge.So, you don't crop, you're fine with this one.  (never use the digital zoom - but that goes for any camera... you can do that on the computer later and actually see how much you're losing).  It's simple, small, good zoom range, close up and some zoom ... you like that... this is a good camera.For less than a $100... a good option.  But if you want flexibility editing your pics later... cropping them, zooming on the computer, enlarging.... you might consider a Nikon or Casio... a little more expensive, but much better quality.....  those are not as good as the Panasonic on the zoom range, otherwise as good or better.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for convenience, not for picture quality", "Author": "Jill B.", "ReviewID": "R34ODVPE588HAY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you are mainly interested in this camera because of how small it is, then you'll like it. However, if you're at all concerned about picture quality, this is not for you. The images are very grainy and about half of mine would come out blurry. I returned it after a week. It would probably be ok if you just wanted to print 4 x 6 photos without any cropping (ie, not zooming in with your computer).", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great, small camera", "Author": "Josh Hoevelmann", "ReviewID": "R1LETYHAM5V1AB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife as an alternative to her digital SLR.  For under the $100 range this camera is great!  The flash does a great job as long as you're at least 4 feet or so from the subject.  It does take some getting used to the settings and which ones to use, but they work really well.  My biggest reason for choosing this over many others is that the digital stabilization is optical instead of digital.  This makes a big difference, especially when zooming a long way.  Be patient with this camera and play with the settings.  I mostly change two things.  Red eye off for candid, moving objects.  Red eye on when taking portraits.  Flash off when closer than 3 or 4 feet.  You can however, change the flash intensity if you are taking a lot of close ups.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "System Error - Revised", "Author": "MDB", "ReviewID": "R2VZMTBHPWQFB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received product from Amazon quickly and looked forward to testing it out before an upcoming vacation. After charging the battery, reading the manual, formatting some SDHC cards, and playing around with the modes and menus, I tried it out. As the title says, I immediately received either \"system error (zoom)\" or \"please turn camera off and on again\" errors when I atempted to zoom (just out of the box so no drops or sand, etc.). The zoom functionality worked maybe three times out of dozens and dozens of attempts (and won't work period at this point). The lens does move (not stuck in any position) and the camera will take a picture. It just won't zoom, which makes it the equivalent of a disposable. I contacted Panasonic's customer service dept. after registering the product and they told me to reset the camera and retry, which I did to no avail (several times). Further, they advised sending it to their customer service center in Texas for potential replacement with a reconditioned model (if under warranty - which it better be since I got it a week ago - and the aforementioned reset didn't work). I guess a reconditioned is the best they'll do. Of course, I don't have a time frame of when the reconditioned model will arrive (will be mailing it to them shortly), so I may need to purchase another camera before I leave. Don't know if this is a known issue with this model, but needless to say I'm not too happy. I'll update the review if I get a camera that works.Revised review: Returned via Amazon's 30 day policy and received a new, working, model (much better than the refurbed option via Panasonic). Anyway, I used the camera pretty extensively and tried many of its functions. It isn't the greatest in low light (but you can improve things by playing around with the settings), and there are some issues with clarity/stabilization even with the OIS on. That said, it delivered some really good images and fits easily into any pocket (and well into a small Case Logic soft case also available on Amazon). Considering price, convenience, number of features, and solid image quality overall (and some images much better than that), I'd definitely recommend it (especially if you want something small to carry on your travels).", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "We love this little camera", "Author": "B.

It was one of the few pocket cams that offered an F2.8 lens and a 28mm wide angle in that price range. I find the zoom button aggravating, starts slow and then goes too fast, but I will probably develop a better knack for it soon.  I bought this on a trip, and had no time to practice. I consider myself a serious amateur, and I was able to work most important settings within a few minutes. Excellent ease in that respect. I shoot in what is essentially \"Program\" mode, as this camera does not offer shutter or aperture modes (I find it too much trouble to go to \"scenes\" and iA mode is too auto for me). The exposure compensation adjustment is easy, quick and wonderful, tho the scale for it is oddly placed in the middle of the image (why not at the bottom?). Force flash mode, white balance and ISO all easy and quick to get to via a type of top menu with pull downs, like a computer program. Nice!  Color seems natural, exposure good, sharpness lacking a bit, but then, it is a cheap pocket camera! Quick startup, size and shape is wonderful. I would say it seems a bit slippery at the chromed edges, I have a feeling I will drop it someday. Some grippy points at the corners would really help.

I also bought this camera because the HD mode, but it was not very impressive.  Even with a Class 6 memory card there were some stutters.  Needless to say, I returned this camera and will be keeping my Cannon SD1000, and perhaps purchase a larger camera in the future with a bigger lens for better image quality.

I got the ZR3 because of the extra zoom and 25mm for my next trip to Disneyland with my kids, but after comparing the same pictures taken with both the FH1 and ZR3, the FH1 got most of the pictures sharp and well exponsed, and might be the camera to take on my trip. The ZR3 did a little better outside in well lit conditions, but indoors the FH1 had better detail and the compression engine that was supposed to be worse than the ZR3, actually did better on low light than the ZR3. The 25mm with a small flash might be too much for the ZR3 to take good indoor pictures. The 28mm of the FH1 did better.

What you pay in this case, $89 is too few for such a product. What shocked me at first was the minute size of it. This camera is a keeper. Before purchasing one I was pondering whether or not I'd be able to understand all the myriad buttons & functions cameras come with these days and surprisingly, I fared better than I even expected. I picked it up so soon and found the type of picture format i liked with little strain and frustration. However, the zoom was elusive to me. (I didn't think I needed to read an instruction manual given the common occurence of a digital camera these days but maybe I should've) I had to find somebody show me that the zoom relied in the form of a sort-of-wheel one could steer to the left/right in order to magnify/retract the image. This was located right at the front of the shoot button.If anything, this only made the camera so much better. There are so many functions, I personally dislike the intelligent auto format which is supposed to select the best picture type for any environment. But that's just another option which maybe somebody else less detail-oriented may find appealling. I rather take pictures which display a wide array of colors and an intense fullness to them and this camera pulls that off extremely well! It's only a matter of finding what picture size/quality/zoom /proper alignment of shades, brightness, contrast/ intensity of colors / flash or no flash to take pictures of a quality you could not believe for $89!Also, the lithium-ion battery lasts for an eternity. According to the manafacturer it can last up to 300+ shots.

I tested it and compared it to other digital cameras.  Then, I returned this camera, and bought my wife the Canon SD1300 IS instead because it is clearly a superior camera that costs only a little more.I compared the Panasonic Lumix DMC FP1, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1, the Canon Powershot S500 (my 8 year old malfunctioning digital camera), the Canon Powershot SD1300 IS, and my Canon Rebel T1i (my dSLR...an unfair comparison, but I wanted benchmark for these cheaper cameras).  I had always liked my old Canon S500, but I read some reviews on Amazon and other websites, and it seemed like the Panasonic cameras were really good cameras at a great price.For me, the number one consideration is picture quality.  If you don't have that, you don't have anything.  Things that detract from picture quality are poor signal to noise, lack of sharpness, poor color rendering, and various artifacts.  Therefore, I tested these 5 cameras under different conditions.  I copied the jpegs onto my computer, and I looked at the images at 100% to see how good they really are.  The most revealing results were shot under medium light indoors.  This is very important if you ever want to take any indoor pictures.  The results were as follows (from best to worst):1) Canon T1i (1 year old, about $700), excellent pictures even without flash2) Canon SD1300 IS (brand new, about $110), very good photos for a compact digital camera3) Canon S500 (8 years old, $400 new, not performing as well as it used to)Surprisingly, although this is not shooting as well as it used to 8 years ago, it still outperformed the Panasonic cameras.4) Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1 (brand new, about $90), this had very poor signal to noise and moderately poor color rendering.5) Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP1 (brand new, about $80), this camera performed significantly worse even than the FH1.  The non extending lens is nifty but yields poor photos.In addition to this, I found that the Canon was easier to operate and easier to take videos.Nowadays, compact digital cameras are quite inexpensive.  Do yourself a favor and buy a high quality camera.  More megapixels does NOT necessarily mean better pictures, and having a large optical zoom can sometimes compromise lens quality and thus picture quality.  Also, consider sensor size: this can make a big difference in picture quality, though some manufacturers make better sensors even when comparing sensors of the same size.  In my experience Canon consistently makes high quality digital cameras.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excelente camara a bajo costo", "Author": "WILFREDO DIAZ SANCHEZ \"wilfdiaz\"", "ReviewID": "R1IRO5ZDJ7MVRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Es una excelente camara a pesar del poco tiempo que la tengo.
