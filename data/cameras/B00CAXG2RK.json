{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Everything I Wanted...And Some I Didn't", "Author": "feltennova", "ReviewID": "R2SISEJB7X0C0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I studied up on cameras for months before spending this much money as I am new to photography; not a professional.  I am happy to say I LOVE this Canon Rebel T5i.I really wanted the 18-135mm lens as it eliminates the 'human zoom'.  In fact the more powerful lens never leaves the camera bag.  I'm sure it will come in handy some day when I find my self in the nose bleed section at a sporting event, but the 18-135mm lens is where it's at for family events.  Allows me to pull in tight on someone across a large room for getting candid shots.The camera bag is ok, nothing great.  The interior is lined with velcro allowing the dividers to be moved/removed to fit you needs.  So, not bad at all, but feels a little 'thin'.  I wish the shoulder strap was longer as I prefer to carry it across the body.  Thus far it has held up fine to light use, but anticipate I'll be replacing it within the next couple of years.  The plan black look could be seen as a plus as it doesn't advertise you are packing around an expensive camera.I LOVE the twin battery handle.  I read other reviews that said it was good, and I have to agree.  It is almost an exact match to the camera in every way.  Looking at pictures of the Canon offering, it is darn near an exact replicate.  The ONLY difference the prevents it being an exact match to the camera is the texture and shine is off by a very small margin.  After some use the newness of anything wears off, which has allows the camera body and the twin battery handle to become a perfect match; you cannot tell it is not a Canon product.  All buttons work as they should, the build quality is tops, and it fits perfectly.  I love having the second battery and the extra weight does not bother me at all as I am not a small individual.The micro SD card is a class 6, plenty fast.  The USB adapter is nice as it makes it easy to copy the pictures to my computer.The tripod is an 'affordable' model, but functions.  I would not expect it to hold up to constant use such as what a professional would put it through, but it works fine for light duty.The other extras round out a good package, but I went for this package over others for the main components.  I wanted the T5i, the 18-135mm lens, the twin battery handle, and the filters.  The fast micro SD card and USB adapter were a bonus.  Most of the other items see seldom use, but are handy.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "very happy to made this purchase!", "Author": "eugenio lozano", "ReviewID": "R1DLAJ41CZOZKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The compleat package is great, comes with everything you need for a starter kit.It was very well packed, and arrieved on time.The camera, extra lens, and battery are the best things on the bundle.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera Set", "Author": "Country Girl", "ReviewID": "R1FBYVCZVVGZGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great bundle for the price. If purchaed seperately would be more expensive. I went from a T1i to this T5i. Still getting use to the difference in the camera. Have not used all the extra's yet but I am very happy with the camera and both lenses. I really like the 18-135. The 55-250 is a very good lens also. So far very Happy with purchase.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,149.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 14 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens + <2> Canon EF-S 55-250mm II IS Lens + <3> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> Spare LP-E8 Battery + <5> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter + <6> Vivitar 67mm UV Glass Filter +\n<7> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control + <8> PD Digital SLR Camera Case + <9> Zeikos BG-E8 Battery Grip + <10> Precision Design 58\" Tripod +\n<11> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <12> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <13> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <14> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens with EF-S 55-250mm IS Lens + 32GB Card + Battery + Case + BG-E8 Grip + Filters + Tripod Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519x3XXmHTL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CAXG2RK"}}
