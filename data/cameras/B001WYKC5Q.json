{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice Little Camera", "Author": "Joe K. \"Joe K.\"", "ReviewID": "RQP6ZN19E3QPH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice little camera.  Very easy to use.  I started using it right after I put the batteries in and not even reading the instructions.  Sturdy, nice looking, and small.  Easily fits in any pocket.  I bought a cover for it to protect it.  Takes really nice pictures.  The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is just like what other people said, it you are not steady the picture will be blured. But I'm pretty sure there is a setting to correct that, I better read the instructions!  I've taken about 90 pictures so far. Very nice color. The batteries lasted for about 75 using flash. And sometimes there is a few seconds delay after you use the flash, but there is a red led on top of the camera to let you know.  Other cameras I've used have done the same thing, so I don't think this is unusual.  This camera also takes videos with sound.  The LCD screen is large and clear enough to see even in the sun. Like I said, maybe I should read the book, and I might give it 5 stars as it has several settings which I haven't tried yet. But it is easy enough to use so you can start taking pictures as soon as you get it out of the box.  So I'm happy I bought it, have taken a lot of really nice pictures, and the price is a lot cheaper than if you bought a similar camera with a more well known brand. I like my little camera!", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not bad...", "Author": "Colleen White", "ReviewID": "R1VWOAQBQ4X6VK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is not a bad camera for the price.  It's pretty small, but not as small as the ELPH I had previous to this.  I like the fact that it takes regular AA batteries, since they're easy to come by.  It goes through them pretty quickly, though, so I use rechargeables in it.  What I DON'T like is how long the flash takes to recharge.  There's a significant delay between pictures if you have the flash on.  At least 5 seconds or more.  This is very irritating when you want to take duplicate pictures of the same pose.  Overall, it's a decent camera for the price, but I miss the quality of my old (and much more expensive) camera.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice little point and shoot, simple to operate.", "Author": "LDW", "ReviewID": "R1PVQQAXW757K7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for a fine little picture taker with nice zoom range and excellent stability control, ( no blurry pictures ). I read the reviews after purchasing the camera and was shocked at the negativity. This little camera is fun to use if you just want to take pictures without the fuss of doing alot of adjustments. It even has a little icon on the mode wheel for panaramic and is super easy to use. The pictures are crisp, clear, and if you hold it pretty steady you can zoom without blurriness.This is last years model and is at a super price point now. I would highly recommend it.The only con I have found is that it uses 2 AA batteries and with the flash on it eats up the power pretty quickly but then I have rechargeables and will try them.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera!", "Author": "Markgbe", "ReviewID": "R3NF4UYXC48UJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use camera.

I had a 4MP camera before this, so I assumed the difference would be rather dramatic.

I just erased existing photos because those pictures were saved on my PC anyway).Wrist Strap (for carrying camera) wasn't included.Some of the pictures come out darker (once you upload them to your PC) even after you selected the proper setting (indoor, outdoor, landscape, etc).

It will have the dreaded \"Battery Exhausted\" screen pop up and shut off after a couple pictures within a few minutes. Basically its saying the cameras overheating. The batteries are most likely fine and still have plenty of juice though. Give it a few minutes and things can get going again. Also my other complaint is the video, sound is fuzzy, and its being an HD camera CANNOT take HD video. 320x240 or 640x480 are your two options.

I bought a refurb from one of the Amazon merchants for about $53. The camera arrived in nearly perfect condition. There was one tiny scratch on it, but that is to be expected with a refurb. Without even reading the brief quick start paper I was able to start taking pictures since the menus are very simple to navigate. You will need to download the full manual from GE to get the most out of it. I will note that the camera came with the wrong USB cable and the vendor has not been very helpful about getting me the correct one. However, I use the SD card and trasfering pictures diectly off of the card is always a lot faster than using USB. However it still would be nice to have the correct cable. And since it's a proprietory cable, I would have to buy one specific to this series of cammeras (about $10).This is not the smallest camera out there since it does use AA batteries (which I prefer since you can buy them anywhere). And when it comes to cameras, smaller is not always better. Too small and light can result in blurry pictures from even the slightest movement. Larger and heavier cameras are typically more stable due to the size and weight. As noted by others, this camera does have image stabilization if needed.The picture quality is more than adequate for my needs, and IMO is better than cameras costing around $200.

If it breaks through a case from mild pressure, I can't recommend this camera due to it's construction.  I called support and LCD is not covered under the year warranty.  They can replace the LCD for $35 plus what I have to pay to ship it to them.  Not sure that I want to spend $40+ to fix a cheaper camera that may have the exact same brittle LCD.

This camera seems incredibly cheap and even after going thru the owners manual on cd I was still scratching my head. I bought this simply because it was higher megapixels and had 2aa batteries and used a sd card so I had the same set up as my HP.I've always used rechargeable NiMH batteries to save the environment and money and have 6 I keep charged.  I put two in the GE and it powered up and said \"batteries exhausted\".  These were fresh off the charger.  I put in two others and took 2 pictures and it said \"batteries exhausted\".  I put the same 2 batteries in my HP and the battery power was full.  I called newegg and they offered to exchange it with another but were good enough to give me my money back.  Maybe I was just having an off day or it was a second shift friday product, but I'll stick with HP.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Go ahead and buy, if you like blurry pictures!", "Author": "Christina Rogers", "ReviewID": "R18SDTZK7251LZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hate this camera!!!  The thing has a delay, sometimes, and it's unpredictible.  So sometimes it will take the picture right away when I press the shutter button, and other times it doesn't until the third time or when it's held down, so then I get a picture of people looking confused or dropping the smiles.  Also, there's no stablization, so the pictures are blurry with any movement at all.  This camera is worthless and a waste of your money.  Do not buy!!!", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Chelsea Rivera", "ReviewID": "R2P4GJ0J111P6T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I haven't had a chance to use a lot of functions yet.
