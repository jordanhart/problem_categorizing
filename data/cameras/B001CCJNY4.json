I knew that going into the purchase, though it wasn't as bad as I was expecting.I can live with that, however, because otherwise this camera is amazing. I had a Nikon Coolpix 550, which gave me the dreaded \"lens error\" message after only 3 months, and it never worked again. Having young children in the house and enjoying taking pictures on all kids of trips in all kinds of conditions, I can't afford to have a camera that needs to be treated like a decorated egg.That's where the 1050SW comes in. The durability of this camera is nothing short of awesome. I love having a camera that can be dropped and get soaking wet and still work perfectly. The sliding lens cover keeps junk out of the lens area when the camera's not in use. Genius all-around design.As far as the photos themselves, there are TONS of settings that can greatly improve picture quality. Leaving the setting to \"auto\" 100% of the time will not always provide the best photo quality, but making a change in the easy-to-use photo menu can make a huge difference in the end result.A 3x zoom has its obvious limitations, but for an everyday/every condition camera that will last and last, this is a superb all-around camera.", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "not perfect", "Author": "H. Schisa", "ReviewID": "R6N9GNEYLBL8G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I use this camera at sea (caribbean).  Yesterday it survived four hours in very rough water when hurricane was a few hundred miles north, through crashing waves and the like while I mostly tread water and watched to keep from being carried out to sea.  However, there are three things which are troublesome.  First, when you click to take the picture, there's a delay in its taking the picture so if you want to get something that's gone quickly, you can't judge things too well.  Secondly, the digital display is hard to aim with a moving target, and it can't be seen in heavy sunlight.  Third, movies seem to be limited to about ten seconds, and there is popping noise in the video at somewhat regular intervals.  So, it's fairly rugged for shallow depths, and the size is great, some pictures are not too bad, but the above criticisms create problematic results under certain circumstances.", "Date": "November 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "great and not so great", "Author": "Jessica Guli \"my3sons\"", "ReviewID": "R32I22FNAC5NJO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Whats Great:  durability, picture quality is great so far too...I have 3 small boys, so I needed to buy something that could handle them.  I have always purchased olymupus cameras becuase of the picutre qauality, but my boys seem to always manage to throw my cameras out a window, or into water...this was my only choice.  There are no other's like it on the market in this price range.What's not so great:  shutter delay..i hate it.  I absolutely hate th delay, i'm trying to get used to it.  I almost have to guess what's gonna happen...not easy with a 1,3 and 5 year old!  Thre are other settings you can use to try and make it better, but i just have to get used to it, again, durability is the most important thing to me ..i have gone through-i think-3 cameras alredy...I cant keep buying them, too expensive.  the other not so great feature is the strange lcd screen.  when you make the slighest movement it gets blurry..i really dont use it, when i'm taking a picutre, i just look at the subject..i iwll peek to make sure what i'm taking is in frame but that's about it.  I'm not a huge fan of the slider that opens and closes the lens..it does open easy, sometimes when it's in my bag, it opens on me.  the last thing i'm not too crazy aobut is that it takes a while to turn on...if sometihg is happening that i want to shoot really fast, between the delay of it turing onn nd the dely on the shutter, i usually miss it.  I also think all cameras should come with a case-only some do, this one doesnt..that annoys me...the card, and extra battery costs enough..All in all, it's ok.  If durability wasnt the most important thing, i would hve returned it and gotten something different.Hope that helps!", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not a good camera for a \"point and shooter\"", "Author": "Tiffany Mitchell \"tifmitch\"", "ReviewID": "R1UKGCBB3L9V1P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted to like this camera.  I wanted to like it so very, very much. The design and the features sounded amazing.  The camera looks great, it's light, feels sturdy, and I fully believe that it would do great underwater or survive the kind of fall that would cause other cameras to disintegrate.  Frankly, I was drooling over the prospect of having one to use.  Seriously; it sounded like the 007 of cameras.Unfortunately, I am not capable of taking ANY good pictures with this camera.  That's right...absolutely no good pics.  This wasn't due to lack of trying.  Because my other digital camera is an Olympus, I wanted to stay within the family to keep the acclimation to an updated operating system simple.After thoroughly reading the manual, testing the camera in snow settings, indoors with high, average, and low illumination, with objects up close and far away, moving targets, night settings, static objects, and food shots; I found that I could not for the life of me take a decent photo.  I adjusted light levels on the camera, I tried different modes, different qualities of picture, anti-shaking mode, a fixed camera position, and of course I tried the AUTO mode.  God help me, at one point I am pretty sure that I sacrificed a live chicken.  All the while, I had my older Olympus taking shots in the sames settings on AUTO.  The older camera took great shots.  I must stress, I took well over 200 test shots with each camera. The 1050SW was returned for a new camera from a different brand...which is taking great photos out of the box with no time spent on the manual yet.Maybe it's me.  I hope it's just me.  Bottom line: if you're like me and want a \"point and shoot\", this may not be the camera for you.  An advanced user might have a better go of it...but 10.1MP and a sexy design won't be of much help if you can't easily take a photo.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera for outdoors and a beginner", "Author": "Baxter", "ReviewID": "RJY7JCS6FUJ6Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as my first digital to use while fly-fishing and skiing - I love it - all the different settings and functions helps me get good shots regardless of the light or conditions I am in - and I don't have to worry about getting it wet or dropping it - I wasn't sure if I would like the slide on and off lens cover but I do - it is an easy way to turn the camera on and off and protects the lens face - I like the pocket size and weight - I like the ability to plug it into a TV monitor to see a big version of my pictures and/or play them back as a slide show - I bought 3 extra batteries very cheap here on Amazon and never worry about running out of power -  all in all, I don't see how any amateur, outdoor photographer could go wrong with this amazing little camera.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Durable Camera Made for Real Life", "Author": "a reader", "ReviewID": "R3B16PH8DO09BU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, the downside. There is a lag time between photos. I've experienced it most often in Auto mode at sunset, due to the shutter remaining open longer. In bright daylight, this is not as much of a problem.The upside: huge. I've had plenty of point and shoot cameras. One fizzled out when a single raindrop hit it. Another froze up every time we were in the snow. Spent one day on a sandy beach, and its back to camera shopping. The Olympus is different. It's a fantastic family camera.All the places I like taking family photos are precisely the environments that will ruin most cameras. Not this one.This camera has taken crisp, high-quality photos underwater (it was strange, dunking my camera in freezing water, taking a photo, then continuing on our hike--the camera still worked!)at the top of a ski run in gusting freezing wind, on the beach at sunset, and also indoors.My past experience w/point-and-shoots is that they advertise loads of features, but once I had the camera, I never used them. The olympus features and the different modes for sunset, snow, portrait, close-ups, etc. are easy to find.This Olympus is a go-anywhere camera. Its design is simple and straightforward. The battery held its charge for a long time and recharged quickly. Using the features and settings results in better photos.My friend has a 12 mp Canon Digital SLR, and we've taken comparable photos of sunsets, etc--but he's had to leave his camera at home when its snowing and raining.In short, a well-rounded moderately priced camera that you can occasionally drop, get wet, and expose to dirt and real life.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sailor's Camera", "Author": "David D.

The first one I got a few months ago seemed to work well but while showing the features of the camera to my parents (prospective buyers) I did a \"drop test\" from about 3' into a child's car seat and the camera broke after having it for 1 week. I sent it back and got another one, the same model, and have not had anymore problems. I have taken it down waterslides in video mode with excellent results although the sound quality is only OK due to the occasional \"clicking\" noise. Not sure what that noise is but it could be the wrist strap clanging against the camera which is attached too close to the internal mic. The picture quality is only average though. The greens seem a little washed out and reds don't seem as true as they should be - even with some bright outdoor pictures in ideal conditions. We have subsequently found our 9.0MP E900 (in our 4 year old's closet hiding) and now I use it for most of the pics I take, while my wife uses the Olympus and prefers it. One note- the video mode is limited to 10 seconds on a regular \"M\" XD card so after buying a new \"M+\" XD card I was able to take unlimited length clips. A little disappointing when you already have 3 2GB cards of the regular type. For being a 12MP camera it was a little disappointing but if you include the cool features it makes it a decent all around vacation type camera for beaches (I have lost 2 cameras due to sand), snow, and water.

He has nice digital SLR that he takes beautiful photos with, but it's bulky and fragile and inconvenient to bring on the boat or out on the water.  And he's out there nearly daily.  I got this camera for him for his birthday about a month ago and he just loves it.  I told him about the reviews I've seen about it.  He played around with the settings and has taken many great pictures.  Last weekend, he was sitting on a pier, tying some lures, and felt the pocket of his surfshorts where he'd put the camera.  It had slipped out of his pocket and -plop- fallen into the ocean.  He had not yet tested the waterproof feature.  His face fell.  It was lowtide and we could see it in about a foot of water.  He climbed down, pulled it out of the water and handed it to me.  I turned it right on and took a picture of him, looking all worried that he'd destroyed his birthday gift.

Don't put it in your pocket.", "Author": "Martin Focazio \"Marty\"", "ReviewID": "R1LMYKRW80TI36", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We are big fans of waterproof cameras, we're tough on our point and shoot cameras.I bought this one to replace a Pentax Optio w10 which just plain could not handle the abuse I heaped upon it.This camera had quite a few strikes against it when I was shopping for a waterproof point-and-shoot:- Uses an XD card - these are more expensive and have less capacity than an SD card, and if you want to shoot in \"panorama\" mode, you MUST use an Olympus branded XD card. These cards are FAR more expensive than SD cards. - It uses a poorly engineered proprietary battery pack. Now admittedly, lots of point and shoot cameras use oddball batteries, but this battery can be inserted wrong - it's hard to see the marking on the battery compartment that indicate which way the three contacts go.OK, well that didn't seem to be a big deal, so I bought the camera.After a few weeks, I began to find some really annoying things about it:- The USB out port is VERY uncommon. While most devices use a mini-usb port for connecting to a camera, this one uses a variant of the mini USB port that you simply can't find in all the usual places. Given that it uses an uncommon card format (XD), the cable is important for transferring pictures off when you don't have an XD card reader handy.- The sliding lens cover slides open all too easily, and this turns on the camera. MANY times I found that the lens cover had slid down and the battery was depleted when I wanted to take a picture. Turning on \"Power Save\" mode didn't really help, as it was very quick to power-down (like 30 seconds) and it's not possible to change the turn-off time.- It forgets its settings (time and date) when the main battery runs down. So you can't just recharge the battery and shoot pictures again - you have to set the date and time on re-boot after a battery depletion if you want the date and time to correctly populate the files.- The screen is not transflective - making daylight visibility pretty much impossible.These were annoying, but not to the point of wanting to give up on the camera.Then we went to the beach.When you buy this phone, they include a sheet of paper, obviously added in as an afterthought, that warns you to \"rise the camera under fresh running water for 10 minutes\" after using it in salt water or at the beach. We carefully followed all the the instructions, but to no avail. Eventually, after moderate use in the water, we saw condensation inside the view screen as well as behind the lens and the camera behavior became erratic (would not power on, could not change settings).This condensation gave a \"haze\" to the images. I can't post images here, if I could I'd show you.Fortunately, by leaving the camera in a warm, dry place (our car) it did seem to dry out again - the haze went away for a while.But then we had the problem that finally made this camera \"unacceptable\".The sliding lens cover at the front - as mentioned before - tends to get bumped open and this kills the battery. But what it also does is trap any sand that happens be at the intersection of the lens cover and the body of the camera - and you can't see the sand, as it drops in behind the lens cover a bit. When you close the cover, the sand drags over the lens and scratches it. And that ends your camera's usefulness. By the time the vacation ended, even dry, the lens damage left the images soft and unacceptable.It's a shame, because it did have fairly good image quality - in fireworks mode, I was able to get really good images of lighting striking the ocean at night, and the fast-multi-shot mode was fantastic for action photos - really good solution to the shutter lag problem of all small digital point and shoots.Video - which was made with a codec that produced massive, bloated files - was good, audio quality on the video was minimally acceptable.All in all, I'd not buy this product nor would I suggest to anyone that they by it. We'll be going back to the Pentax Optio series of Waterproof cameras - they may not be as \"drop-proof\" as this one, but I need a camera that's ready to shoot when I am (without being so \"forgetful) and can withstand the rigors of real life better than this one.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "My new camera", "Author": "Shelley C.

After 3 trips with poor quality pictures to show for it, I said no more and wanted a good underwater digital camera.Did my research and wanted this camera for my Birthday, but my husband and his best friend who is a professional photographer went out camera shopping.  They ended up buying me the Canon Powershot G10, not the 1050SW.  Believe me, the G10 is a great camera and I am glad we have it, but does not fit into your pocket and requires underwater housing to take snorkeling.  Not what I wanted.  Appreciated the thought though.So for Mother' Day I finally got the Olympus 1050SW because I wanted a point and shoot to take snorkeling, jumping off the cliffs in Negril, etc. and to take skiing with me.  Hubby will still use G10 w/housing for amazing snorkeling and sunset pics, but I love the idea of how durable and slim this camera is.  The G10 took a great underwater photo but was so cumbersome and bulky.  My camera took an amazing picture and saw so convenient and durable.  Even the professional photographer who told my hubby to get me the G10 wants the 1050SW himself.  That is saying alot!Took nearly 500 pictures with this camera in Jamaica and probably half were underwater and half out of the water and it worked beautifully everywhere!!!!  The underwaters shots were beautiful and the camera is so easy to use.Read the instructions before using in the water.  Pretty simple, make sure the battery/card compartment is securely shut, put lens barrier down and keep it down until you are out of the water and have rinsed it in fresh water.  Also, put your \"scene selection\" to \"underwater\" and go.  Couldn't be simpler.My boss saw my underwater pictures and immediately handed me his credit card and asked me to log onto Amazon and purchase one for him.  He loves it too!Highly recommend purchasing the extra battery, especially if you are going on vacation and will be snorkeling and/or diving alot because you will have the power on the entire time.Also, I recommend purchasing the floating strap.  First we snorkeled without it and it was hard to keep around my wrist.  Too much strap to hold securely and I stressed passing it off to my daughter or husband.  Used the floating strap and it was wonderful.  It is very comfortable and the camera stays on your wrist beautifully.  Also, I had no worries as we would pass the camera back and forth.  A must buy!

I bought this camera for my trip to the Grand Canyon and also took along my Canon Rebel xti for the dry hikes when I wasn't running rapids. The flaws I ran into:- battery life is not the best, a battery lasted at most three days. My Canon Rebel (which I took more pictures using) lasted all ten days- battery indicator was not accurate, one moment I had a full charge the next moment I was nearly empty- the LCD is impossible to see under direct sunlight when you are outside- cannot recharge the camera via USB which means you can't use a solar charger.- camera does not come with any memory cards- slow delay when taking a picture- when the lens cover flips down the camera turns on. I believe this explains the bad battery life. In my pocket or backpack normal activities (like walking) bounced the camera around enough where the lens cover flipped down thereby turning the camera on.- reviewing photos on the LCD appeared jagged (pictures were fine but hard to tell on the camera's LCD)On the plus side:- (IMPORTANT FEATURE) Since the camera is self-contained (water proof) sand didn't get into the inner workings of the camera. This is very important if you are taking lots of shots on a long outdoor trip. I was really scared that the sand was going to ruin my Canon Rebel. I have seen cameras ruined by dirt in the environment.- Panoramic pictures came out good - I really like this feature- Camera is waterproof!- Camera has a great form factor, I kept mine in my swimming trunks - I accidently went swimming with the camera on multiple times.All in all I would recommend this camera for a outdoor excursions.

The sliding lens cover, however, slips open a bit to easily, like in my purse, so doesn't work that well to keep stuff out of the lens area when the camera's not in use.The tap feature just isn't that handy, unless you spend all the time required to figure it out (and a flight to panama isn't enough time, apparently).As far as the photos themselves, the right settings can really improve quality, but they take some time to get to know. I found that Auto doesn't always work that well.  It's just not that smart.I found this camera to be great for the beach, but preferred my slr for the forest and nature photography.The more i get to konw the camera, the more i like it.  I appreciate the durability, but will use my Nikon d40 for faster, sharper images when i really want good ones.

If you live a life style that needs a tough camera this one is certainly for you. I have dropped it hundreds of times and it has NEVER needed a repair. The LCD screen still looks brand new. It takes good pictures too. The video on it is AMAZING with excellent sound. I have a very nice camcorder but over the years I only use this camera for videos.

Trying to take a timed shot--I placed the camera on a shelf and because it's slightly top heavy, and it keeled over and smashed both times. Well, finally learned my lesson! This new camera has no external zoom, so that's one thing I don't have to worry about breaking. It's also shock-proof and water-proof. Basically, idiot-proof. But, with extra protection comes limitations in quality. When I press the shutter to take a photo, there is about a 4-second lag (and the screen goes through epilectic frenzy, so you're not exactly sure when the shot has actually been taken). Doesn't seem like much, but I like to take a lot of candid shots. Also, when you are \"tracking\" an object through your camera screen, it lags and constantly negotiates lighting, and that can be disorienting/annoying. I haven't tried using any of the other features, yet (video, panorama, etc) and so don't know quality of sound, clarity, etc. The most ironic part? It has a top panel that slides over the lens and view-finder--yep, top heavy!! Overall, this is a good camera--especially for the insanely cheap price I got it for.

The underwater part is just an added bonus!  I did some testing of my own for photo quality and it took better photos indoors than my Nikon Coolpix S550.I only wish it had more zoom and longer battery life.  Battery life is less only because the battery is very small and lightweight.  I will simply buy a spare battery.  I would rather have small and lightweight.  Even though battery life isn't great, it isn't bad, either.  I think that over 200 photos and some videos on one charge isn't that bad.

However, the Digital Image Stabilization is pretty worthless. I assumed it would be available with all scene modes or in manual mode like my other digital cameras, but there are only two choices--either choose it by itself via the dial on the back or with the movie mode. If you choose DIS, it isn't really an image stabilizer because all it does is increase the ISO to some unspecified value so the shutter speed can be increased, and turns the flash to Auto. The 1050 newsletter from Olympus says it works best in well-lit outdoor scenes, but that's usually the time you need it least. I haven't tried the DIS in a lot of different lighting situations, but I anticipate low light shots using it to be very noisy due to the high ISO.

People around me who try to use it complain that it takes forever to focus and snap the first photo. I dont have the most stable hands but it takes a lot of blurry pictures, even with the flash, the person in main focus will be blurry. The front has a sliding door which turns on/off the camera. I keep it in my front pocket and it usually comes out with the slider open, so I've wasted battery life on nothing. I keep it set on battery save mode. I purchased a spare xd card but the battery doesn't last long enough to need another xd card. I purchased three additional batteries and it goes through them quick! The other thing that it's really annoying is the tap control. I do a lot of four wheeling and the bouncy roads will auto activate tap control, so then I'm wasting time turning it off.

I'm not saying it takes professional photos or videos but I have captured some of my favorite memories that I could never replace with it.  I am on the clumsy side so it has been dropped, left outside, and put through the ringer :)  It has been in my diaper bag out of a case...as many moms know...this can be a messy place.  You can rinse it and it is like new.  It has made several trips to the mountains in Colorado.  It has sat near a campfire, been taken to the river with our kids, gotten dirty, and has made trips to the pool.  I have taken video under the cold water in the river and photos and videos in the pool.  I have priceless footage of my daughter learning to swim from in the pool with her.  You don't have to worry about it being splashed.  I love how you can start a video from under the water and then take it out and continue above water.  The photos from under water are crystal clear.  I am going to try to add a photo here that I have taken under water.  I would say that most of the photos I have taken with it are very clear.  The only drawback, like others have said, is that the shutter speed isn't very fast.  I have another camera (that I take much better care of) that I use when I'm taking photos that I plan on photo shopping and putting on my webise or framing.  This camera does take just as good of photos but I can capture more with my other one that has a faster shutter speed.  This camera is well worth it for the fun water photos and not worrying about it getting damaged.  It also has great features like the tap, the anti shake-which comes out clear for me every time, and so many menu options that I haven't been able to use them all.  I lost the camera a few months ago.  I am going on vacation this month and have been reading the reviews for the newer models of the Olympus under water cameras.  I saw less problems reported with this camera than with the newer models.  I found the camera today and am so happy!  It was in a bag in my garage and has been out there since Halloween.  I turned it on, it works just like new and it has a lot of battery life left.  I live in Colorado and it has snowed and frosted many times since then, so I can say that I have tested it being frost proof, water proof, and shock proof....also kid proof :)  I would definitely recommend this camera, especially for a family with kids!

Light", "ReviewID": "R2Q93ZR7EYQQ9C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have bought three Olympus Stylus rugged cameras, the 1000, 1030, and 1050.  The first two had both advantages and disadvantages, the 1050 had primarily disadvantages - especially the tap control.Let me say first that I have been pleased with all of the cameras in terms of picture quality and ruggedness, though I think the 1000 was the best in that regard.  I loved the wide angle feature on the 1030.  I bought the 1050 because the tap control was supposed to make taking photos easier while wearing gloves.  I wintered at McMurdo Station in Antarctica in 2009, and I ended up using the 1030 for almost everything because the 1050 was almost useless in the cold, due to the tap control.Supposedly, the tap control means you don't have to take off your gloves.  In actuality, I ended up having to take off my outer gloves about 4 times as often with the 1050 as with the 1030.  This is because the tap control would take over the camera, and no matter where I tapped or how, the camera never did anything like what it was supposed to do.  I thought I would solve the problem by turning off the tap control before I went outside, but the damned thing turned on the tap control by itself.  Occasionally I would see a great opportunity to take a shot, and I would jog over to a better vantage point, and this tap control would regard this as me entering instructions to change all the settings - so, once I got in position it would take several minutes without my gloves to get back to the settings I needed to take the shot - and then, frequently, the camera would reset the settings again.  However, not once did the tap control interpret an actual tap correctly.This camera also had one other major problem and two minor problems:  the major flaw is that the sliding cover which turns the camera on frequently slides and turns the camera on when it is being carried in a pocket.  In consequence, I have missed many shots because the camera turned itself on and drained all the battery power.  The minor problems were that the photos came out a shade too dark, and the shutter response time can be painfully slow.  Fine for landscapes from fixed locations, not so good for action shots or from a moving platform (like a bus or a boat).All in all, I will never buy another camera with either tap control or the sliding cover.  I really like the rugged quality of these Olympus Stylus cameras, but I hope Olympus can correct these problems in future cameras - and if they insist on having tap control, there must be a way to turn it off for good where it won't turn itself back on.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good hard constructed but with very slow shutter speed.", "Author": "Popochtl de las Monta\u00f1as", "ReviewID": "R101M8J5ZK1E7I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good hard constructed but with very slow shutter speed.

I felt like I was pulling teeth and they gave me a camera and said \"you're on your own\"I am afraid to use it for water shots because despite being brand new, if it fails for whatever reason I am alone, stuck, marooned.I have used Olympus medical endoscopes and these fine intruments have saved lives and the support is excellent.It is hard to believe I am dealing with the same company in the above matter.I would have to think long and hard before purchasing another Olympus product, especially a camera.

It's fun to watch people freak out when you toss it in the pool and then dive in. Tested at 10' of water, and no problems.However - this camera is only good for water play. The pictures are not great. If you're in perfect conditions, the pictures come out decent, but if the conditions aren't picture-perfect, then your pictures won't be perfect. If it's dark, the flash whitewashes everything. If you don't have a real steady hand, forget it! The pictures will be blurry. Video has frame stutter. Battery life isn't all that great either.

I think I'll try it out since it's a cheap, waterproof camera.\"  Don't make the same mistake I made - the delay is freakin' HORRIBLE!!!  Good luck trying to get an action shot - everything has to be set up and timed or you'll miss the picture.I gave it 2 stars 'cause it's fun in the pool - and that's kind of what's advertised.

While I agree that it may have a slightly longer lag than the everyday point-and-shoot... it still works the same way.  Unless you have a digital SLR... you need to press the shutter button half-way until it focuses, and then push it the rest of the way to take the picture.  Once it is focused (which takes a fraction of a second) you can push the button the rest of the way down and it takes the picture immediately.There are also modes where it will take pictures in rapid succession while you hold down the button, so if you need the utility of rapid picture-taking, you can just use this mode and not worry about having to keep focusing and pressing the button.Overall a great camera, and a great buy.

I put it on the video function under the water and it turned out great!  You can see the fish 15 feet below us perfectly clear and can hear audio from under the water.  We got to feed fish bananas and the video of it happening is so neat.  There are so many settings and functions on this camera, that you can always get an amazing shot, yet it's really easy to learn how to use.  There is a tap function on there, but I admit I have yet to read the manual at all, so I don't know how to use it.  But the rest were very self-explanatory and I'm not very electronic-savvy.  A lot of the other reviews complained that underwater it takes 3 seconds from when you hit the button until the photo is actually shot.  This is true, but do not let that deter you from buying this awesome camera!  It's very easy to work around just hit the button a few seconds early.  When I take pictures of my 3 year old underwater I click the camera as soon as he's about to go under and when the picture takes he's under water in the shot.  The picture quality of this camera is really good.  I have taken thousands of pictures on it already (I've had it about a month) and use I use it all the time.  Also, the audio on the video comes in so clear, even under water.

It takes great pictures in and out of the water and is very easy to use. There are so many different settings for lots of different pictures as well. I did find that I didn't really like the firework setting. I've taken better pictures of fireworks with cameras that didnt have the special setting. But other then that, that is my only complaint.

I own other cameras and use to be a professional photographer.  This camera has a tremendous amount of delay - shutter lag.  So much so that it is nearly impossible to take any moving object.  OK - I was ahrd on it - I bought it to bring with me in the outdoors hiking, fishing so if it took a dunking it would still work.  I use to carry my Cannon but it was too big.  Plus the XD Cards are expensive when compared to SD cards.  The one/off slide can easily be turned on when you are not expecting it and drain your battery.  That is a bit of a pain.

Any photo that is not focusing directly on a person's face does not turn out that great. Also, when I compared the exact same picture taken on two different cameras (my Olympus Stylus vs. a friend's camera- not sure which camera, sorry), the picture on the friend's camera has MUCH better color- the people look less washed out and the colors are MUCH more vibrant on other cameras.And on a more serious note, my sister got this same camera and took it on her honeymoon. Since this camera is advertised as \"water-proof\" she took it snorkeling. As soon as it got into the water, the camera broke, and would not take any more pics. So they didn't have a camera for most of their honeymoon, and we are NOT happy with this camera! It should not advertise as waterproof if it really is not.So if you are thinking about getting this camera, I would tell you, it's not a horrible camera. It takes pictures.
