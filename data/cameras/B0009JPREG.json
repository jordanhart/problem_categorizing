I am writing this review to give you the perspective of someone who started out with film SLR cameras in school, then got a digital 5MP camera and have used that for years and am now finally getting into Digital SLR photography.  This is a big step back into the professional circle for me, and I'm anxious to get out to the zoo or to some vacation spot in the mountains to do my professional photography once again.  I purchased this camera almost a month ago and my opinion is that it is the best camera ever made under $2,000.  This camera has everything you can need.I want to warn you, get the full set with the lense.  This lense sells for almost $400 and is about the best all around lense you can find.  Don't go for the cheap models.  I wrote a list about this camera that may appear on this page for you to look at, but be sure that you get the ML-L3 wireless remote (for $20, how can you go wrong) and a spare battery (2,000 pictures sounds like a lot, and I haven't needed to recharge in this month that I've had the camera, but remember that when you go on a trip you may forget to recharge and you don't want to get stuck).  Also, get a tripod (try the Slik Tripods U9000, I wrote a review of it and I find it to be the best buy around for a light-weight tripod that acts like a much heavier one) and get a carrying case (the jury is still out, I haven't found one that I like, I want one that will hold two cameras, 4 lenses, a large flash and a bunch of accessories).If you aren't sure if the D70s is worth the money over the D50 or the D70, it is.  The improved autofocusing system is much better than the others and the larger LCD is worth all the tea in China!  I leave the LCD protector that came with it on and have no problem seeing my pictures, even outside.  Although this is a larger camera than the D50, it isn't much of a difference and you will regret going with the cheaper camera.If your budget was lower, save up and buy this camera.  I bought a CoolPix 5000 a few years back and always kicked myself for not going with the D100.  Now I've gone with the best camera on the market and I'm perfectly happy.  Plus, I have the satisfaction of knowing that none of my friends can show me a better camera (unless they spent $4,000 or more on a D2X or D2H, and none of my friends can afford to do that)!!!", "Date": "August 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "s means Superb!!", "Author": "Wayne Fogel", "ReviewID": "R2B6ROAXTP1WBT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When Nikon has brought out an `s' camera, it is virtually a sure thing that this is a camera you want to get your hands on. The D70s is not an exception. With essentially instant-on (.2 seconds), improved built in flash, a larger and brighter lcd screen, and especially the abilitry to take up to 144 exposures at 3 frames per second make this an incredible improvement to the existing D70. Imagine the sports or wildlife exposures you have the chance to get with this capability!The D70s is the digital SLR to record daily life and life events. With a 6.1 megapixel resolution limits the size of prints you can make with it to about 11\" by 17\". If this is not a problem for you then this is your digital camera. It has wonderful color resolution and great auto-focus capabilities. When you are ready, it is a fully capable manual camera.The D70s comes bundled with the excellent and compact 18-70 Nikkor Lens and one EN-EL3a battery. To get started with the camera I suggest the following in addition:* One extra EN-EL3a Lithium-Ion Battery.* Two 2GB 80X CompactFlash cards with write acceleration (WA) technology.Note: Nikon recommends either the SanDisk SDCFH (Ultra II), SDCFX (Extreme/Extreme III) or Lexar Media 80X WA CompactFlash\u2122 card for best performance.* One CF card reader for your computer. Firewire or USB connection depending upon your needs.As time and money permit you may want to add the following:* A telephoto lens for wildlife and sporting events. The 70-300mm F4-5.6G AF Nikkor is a great value and complements the bundled lens nicely. If money is not an object step up to the 70-300ED or the 70-200 F2.8 with vibration reduction.* A good macro lens such as the AF Micro Nikkor 105mm f2.8.* Polarizing filters for both the kit lens and the telephoto. Get Nikon filters there is no sense in spending money for Nikkor lenses and then putting junk filters on them.* A bag to carry all this stuff.This will get you nicely started.

I'm the typical male with big hands, and every button seems to be placed right where I expect them to be.  I had the opportunity to play around with a Rebel XT afterwards, and not only did the camera feel very awkward (too small), the quick settings buttons & knob did not feel as \"natural\" as they do on the D70s ...far from it.  I would be extremely disappointed today to be an owner of a Rebel XT , and see what a D70 feels like post-purchase.Many people are picking a D50 over the D70s to save some money, and truthfully I think people should think twice about it.Key missing features on the D50:- Grid Lines in the viewfinder.- Shortcut button for metering.  I change my metering mode alot, would be annoying to do it thru the menu each time.- Front dial knob.  Might sound insignificant, but after a while you do get used to controlling Aperture & Shutter speed on their respective front or back knob, especially in manual mode.- Illuminated top LCD.  If you take alot of night photos, you will miss that feature alot.  You could use a mini-flashlight held in your mouth,  but personally I'd grow tired of relying that each time I have to go out at night.- Wireless flash.  Probably a gimmick for most,  but usefull once you know how to exploit it.- Shortcut button for bracketing.  Not that usefull if you shoot in Raw,  but can be great for JPEG landscape photos that have alot of hightlights and shadows.- Compactflash memory card.  SD cards on the D50? ouch.  Compactflash is the most common media type, and the more affordable when it comes to price/storage.  The odds are about 10:1 that in 2-3 years, if you upgrade to a better model than the D50, your new SLR would need Compactflash media.  That's easily a 150-200$ waste right there, if you own something like 2-3 x 2GB memory cards (you will get to a point where you'll want more than one card).All-in-all, I love this camera and I doubt many will be disappointed with theirs.  I would suggest you buy a flash unit like the SB-600 as well.  It opens up a whole new world of indoors photography , both in terms of photo quality, and shooting speed (with the onboard flash you cannot shoot in bursts).P.S. After you've purchased a flash unit, start saving money for a zoom lens.  The 18-70mm kit lens is nice,  but the zoom limit of 70mm will be become very apparent not long after you've purchased your camera.  Take a loot at the new 18-200 VR ;)P.S.2.  There is something I dislike alot on the camera , and it's the fact it doesn't support high-speed USB 2.0.  Yuck, I lost patience with the slow speed after a day only (transferring 2 gigs worth of photos does take quite a while), so I bought a compaqflash reader.  Only 20$, but the camera should have been up to that standard, considering it's a recent model.Enjoy", "Date": "April 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "The s is for superb!!", "Author": "Wayne Fogel", "ReviewID": "R3MXRHJSPVV1IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When Nikon brings out an `s' camera, it is virtually a sure thing that this is a camera you want to get your hands on.

If you want to be able to make larger prints with good resolution, then you need to spend a great deal more money for a higher resolution digital camera (about $5,000) or stick with film. I keep my old N90 for these purposes.Buy the D70s without the bundled 18-70 Nikon lens if (1) you already have a bundle of Nikon lenses; or (2) if you want a more capable first lens for your camera. If you want a more capable lens I strongly recommend the Nikon 24-120 lens. It cost $500 from B&H; photo and will wind up being the lens you always keep on your camera. Its equivalent range in film cameras is 36-180 - in other words slight wide angle to more than satisfactory telephoto. This is the fourth generation of this lens by Nikon and it now has all the bells and whistles: Nikons best ed glass for super sharp and clear pictures, silent wave motor for extremely fast focusing, and vibration reduction to eliminate the shakes in low light. Nikon has other excellent zooms and you may want to look at them but I can highly recommend this lens as one to have if you never want to miss a shot of the kids or what is happening at the instant.* One extra EN-EL3a Lithium-Ion Battery.* Two 2GB 80X CompactFlash cards with write acceleration (WA) technology.Note: Nikon recommends the SanDisk SDCFH (Ultra II), SDCFX (Extreme/Extreme III) or Lexar Media 80X WA CompactFlash\u2122 card for best performance.* One CF card reader for your computer.

My San Francisco-based editor was along for the ride. When I pulled out my Canon EOS 1V, she exclaimed, \"You still shooting film?\" Yes, I am. Or more accurately, was. For even a slow-moving guy like me, when fate steps in to help me make the decision, I get it.Here's the deal: My favorite film - Fuji Velvia 50 - was discontinued.  My E-6 film processor went out of business. A friend - a Nikon Tech Rep - spent an hour convincing me that digital was the best way to go for my magazine work. Finally, he said that the Nikon D70s was the sweet spot when you consider price, quality and performance. Bottom line, this is the camera to have if I was going to dip my toe in the digital water. When I expressed a concern about the number of megapixels, he made a point that 6 megapixels was all I needed. I was still worried but he showed me sample prints and I was convinced.  Oh yeah, my editor has the old Nikon D70 and she has shot several covers with it and lots of full page shots. They too looked good so I placed my order for a D70s.I have just received it so I don't have a lot to say about the camera except that it feels great in my hand. The manual is very well written. The controls are just where they need to be - experienced Nikon users will feel at home immediately.Another selling point - It uses compact flash cards so I can share them with my Canon point-and-shoots. In fact, I almost bought the D50 - a good camera that's a lot cheaper - but it uses the SD format cards. An expense that would blow the savings away as soon as I bought a couple of 1 gig cards.The built-in flash is a bit weak for pro use but since it's there, I don't have to buy a new flash just yet.I plan to use the D70s in 2006 for all my magazine work and thereby save its cost in film and procesing.  If it all works out as planned, I'll upgrade to the D200 when the price drops a bit on that camera and then use this one as my backup.Five stars for now - we'll see later.Update - I shot at the Cloisters in NYC on Christmas Eve.  The camera was easy to handle. The pictures had good color. Afterward, I made a large blow up (8X12) from a JPEG (Fine, Large) and the picture was quite sharp and had good tonal range.Still looking good.Second Update - A shot I took with the D70s with a Nikon 80-200 f:2.8 just was published as the cover picture and it's amazing. Seriously sharp, good color and (dare I say) better than film. And that's with just 6 megapixels.  I believe that most readers (meaning all non-pros AND many profesionals) would find this camera all you need and more.One or two minor gripes after 6 months of hard use and a few raves. The motor drive is too slow for motorsports - 3 fps is not enough. The build-in flash is convenient but with my 20-35 F:2.8 on the camera, anything shot close-up gets a nasty shadow.The battery still rocks - hundreds of shots and no charge needed.As for storage - with a 2 Gig card, it's like 10 rolls of film in the camera. Two 2 Gig cards and you could do a week's vacation without recharging and downloading.I have 3 articles I wrote and illustrated with this camera coming out in a couple of weeks. More on the camera then.PS - The new Nikon N80 is a 10MP camera (like the D200) - that tells me that the D70s is not long for this world.

The lens was frankly all I could afford, otherwise I would have taken a longer lens, or lenses.The camera fits my hand very well (the Canon Rebel feels a little too small for my grip).The near-instant on feature and the camera's ability to take multiple shots without waiting for the images to be saved to the card is impressive.When we went to a whale viewing/photo opp outing the weather was inclement and part of the outing I photographed the whales (as they surfaced and dived) from within the ship, shooting through viewing windows.  The autofocus had difficulty with the raindrops on the windows - focusing on the drops rather than on the whales.  It took only a moment to change to manual focus and continue the shooting.During a trip to photograph wildlife (bears, wolves, sheep, etc.) the autofocus worked perfectly and quickly, allowing me to concentrate on the framing of the shot.The camera was used on small boats, a cruise ship, dog sleds (!), on trains, on buses, in the rain (with a ZipLoc bag over the camera), on a glacier, in a helicopter, in a snow storm (it snows in parts of Alaska even in June), and in temperatures above 90 degrees, and it never missed a beat.Each night I swapped out the battery with the charged alternate, but never came close to exhausting the battery during shooting.  Note that I turned off the \"automatic review\" function, and that may have had a bearing on the battery life; however since I reviewed the shots at night using the same battery, I don't think that is the case.  The battery simply lasts a long time.I've a lot to learn about this gadget, and I've placed an order for an 80-300 mm lens (my wife will probably kill me), but it may be the finest SLR I've ever owned.

Every important function (bracketing, white balance and white balance fine-tuning, etc.) can be easily accessed with buttons and dials without having to fumble through menus on the LCD. The camera turns on in a blink and there is no delay between pressing the shutter and the picture being taken.Some features the D70s has and the D50 doesn't, and that I find really useful:- Depth-of-field preview button- Optional grids in the viewfinder- Direct access button to bracketing functions- A light on the top LCD displayAuto white balance outdoors seems somewhat off (too cold), however this can be corrected easily by setting white balance compensation to -1.

I put off taking my own pictures most of my life, forever plagued by forgetting to adjust F-stops, and thick glasses on my dominant eye.  I couldn't focus with the glasses, and darn sure couldn't do without them.  Then I ran into a pro, (well actually he came along with a reporter to an interview) and he was carrying this Nikon D-70.  After buzzing a few questions by him, I was sold.  He told me he only carries the D-70 and one other for backup, a different model with a huge lens for long-distance shots.  This camera is the best!  Only one slight note of caution--I got Adobe Photoshop Elements and prefer it to the software that comes with the Nikon.  The D-70's size feels just right to me, ( a rather middle-sized woman) not too heavy, but not so light it's likely to be forgotten or misplaced.  The auto focus AFS Nikkor 18-70 lens is worth the extra bucks for ease and sharp focus/re-focus in seconds.  I worried this might be another gadget I'd get bored with after a few weeks of messing around, but it has become my new best pal.  I take it everywhere, and have caught some astounding still shots that actually have artistic value.  The menu is easy to learn; the timer and all other bells and whistles have been a blast, too.

This will do anything most need in a digital camera and more. Naturally for professional quality landscapes you can still go with medium/large format film. If you are such an outstanding photographer that somehow this camera is holding back your enormous skill, talent, and ego, and you have tons more money, grab the D200+lens for just several hundred dollars more. Then you will need a newer more powerful computer to process the files. The D200 will serve for a year until the D300 comes out, then you'll have to lust after it. Of course if you are a pro, you may prefer the D2X to either the D70/D200 prosumer cams.This pics I get from this are equal to 35mm for all practical purposes up to 8x10, possible bigger. If you are interested in taking good quality photos more than you are camera specs and would like a decent camera that will help you develope your skills, this one will serve just fine.You will need some good software to process your pics---Nikon's stuff is subpar especially the Picture Project which seems to have been written by 2 monkeys and a groundhog.People have a lot of different experiences with Nikon customer service.

Because I have been involved in photography for almost 35 years, I have developed certain prejudices. In particular, I have never been comfortable with auto exposure and even less comfortable with auto focus. In fact, the last auto focus camera I owned was a Nikon N8008s that I ultimately sold at auction because I could not adapt to using the various auto settings.However, I like this camera. Why? The D70s is a very easy camera to use and I have only had to refer to the manual to check on a couple of settings and look up some features. Honestly, set up takes only a few minutes and handling is not terribly different from a film camera. I should point out that this camera is really designed for auto focus lenses and if you choose to use your manual focus lot, you will disable many of the camera's features.Because I am both stubborn and cheap (but mostly only when it comes to spending money on myself) I am using my manual focus lenses on this camera. It is true that I do not get any internal exposure meter readings and must rely on a handheld Gossen or the sunny 16 rule (quite effective, really) for exposure determination. The LCD preview screen thus is critical for determining or adjusting exposure. I should also point out that the depth of field preview feature is also lost when using manual focus lenses. I was stunned when I could not stop my lens down and burrowed through the manual to find out what I was doing wrong--which was nothing except that I was using the wrong type of lens. While I really miss this feature, I am not sure how big a loss it really is because of the viewfinder. Others have made mention of the low magnification and tunnel like views through the finder and I can attest to this fact. I compared finder views to my trusty old FM and was just stunned by how poorly the D70 compared.Ultimately the best camera is the camera you use and the D70 has become my camera of choice. Even though I am using this camera like a vintage M series Leica--i.e., handheld meter and presetting exposure in anticipation of a photograph--I find that I can live with this level of usability. At some point I will probably buy an auto focus lens (maybe the 35 f2) and make full use of the feature set.

I have been using older manual 35mm SLRs which really is a good background. Overall I am really happy with it. Some comments:-If you're looking at the D50 with the 18-50mm lens, really consider the D70 kit with the 18-70mm lens. I was going to get the D50 body only and buy this lens but the kit price of this package with this lens made it a no brainer. The 18-70mm lens is built better and I found I really needed the 70mm end of the lens often, plus having a much bigger zoom range without changing lenses. But also watch out becuase on the 35mm end there is a little barrel distortion on the edges of the pictures. (pretty minor though)-The camera is extremely intuitive. I bought this camera right before I went to Burning Man and had snapped about 300 frames before I really dug into the manual. There are many many options in the menus that are pretty much self-explanatory.-The battery life is phenomenal. I have a 1GB hi-speed CF card, and I can fill it up almost twice before running out of battery (about 700 pictures with occasional flash use)My only complaints are minor:-The slight distortion on the wide angle-The viewfider is a litle small (although I have good eyesight and it hasn't been an issue)-I wish the LCD screen was a little bigger.-USB 2 would be nice, but for how seldom I have to dump pictures (I get about 500 on a card) it's not a big deal. You can just buy a CF reader and a 2nd card.-Avoid the 1600 ISO setting unless you really really need it.

Although I liked the 5700 a lot, that type of camera does have some serious limitations, and after a while I realized I had to move on.  If you do decide to get this camera, I highly recommend getting the kit with the len included - it's a high quality lens, adequately fast, and works quite well with the digital sensor (remember there are some differences between digital and film lenses, primarily a 1.5x conversion factor).Do not scoff at the \"only\" 6.1 MP - that's plenty for the vast majority or work.  I've made Super B prints that came out great.  One thought:  For some reason that I don't understand, apparently \"regular\" flashes don't work as well with digital cameras, although the little flash built into the D70s is excellent for simple fill flash.If, like me, you have an investment in Nikon equipment, or are starting fresh, you'll be quite happy with the D70s.", "Date": "February 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny", "Author": "HWS Branson", "ReviewID": "R3SFT3JS4NMQ6Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is not intended to be technical. I just want potential buyers to know that the D70s is worth every penny in my estimation. No camera is going to be perfect. Each will have its drawbacks in one area or another, hence the 4 star rating I gave it. However, don't let that intimidate you into not considering this camera. The only reason I didn't give this camera a 5 star was the fact I would like to have had a double exposure mode and built in flash sync for studio lights. However these negatives are in my estimation only and can be easily worked around. The camera however, works flawlessly, and delivers extremely sharp images in a wide range of lighting situations. It's about as user friendly as digital cameras can get, but needs time to experiment with to really get to know its wide range of uses. It can be used as a point and shoot for the inexperienced or can be used by the pro to allow extensive creativity. And it feels like a camera in your hand!The RAW+JPEG mode is great, however, Nikon has dropped the ball by not including RAW conversion software with this very capable camera. But all is not lost. You can download Rawshooter Essentials software off the internet for FREE which gives you a very good introductory conversion engine for RAW files that's easy to use. Sure beats the $100 Capture 4 software that should have been included with the camera.Since I do a lot of landscape photography, I have found that shooting into the sun can be a headache at times. Lens flare is a significant problem with digital sensors, however, this camera does very well with filters as well as any film camera I have owned. Exposures from the cameras light meter are not the same as my film cameras, and I tend to have to overexpose more with the D70s. It just takes time to learn. But it has been a most enjoyable camera to work with. I have included 4 images on this web page that I shot with this camera for reference as to its color saturation capabilities. It's every bit as good to me as Fugi Velvia or Kodak EV slide film.I hope this helps any potential buyers because I realize digital SLR's are a hot market right now. I considered several different makes before deciding on the D70s. And I have been very pleased with it overall. I don't think anyone from the entry level photographer to the advanced amateur would be disappointed with this piece. I bought this camera with a Sigma 18-200 zoom which covers a wide range with just one lens. The 1.5 magnification factor makes it approximately 27-300, which has done well for me.

Digital could never take the place of film. I'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. There's still something I love about putting a roll of film in the camera, shooting away, sending the film to be processed, and seeing the results. I also know it's a bit expensive. I know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion, but digital cameras are improving in this regard, and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving, we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital SLR and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. So I figured now is the time to get a digital SLR.I have been a loyal Nikon user for nearly ten years, and have owned the Nikon N60, N70, and N80. My first love was, and still is the N70 (I've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought I was the only person who loved the N70).  I purchased the N80 only after my N70 cost too much to repair, but I've enjoyed the way my various Nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if I don't have the time to use specific controls, but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. My Nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes, wildlife shots and all sorts of other things I can't resist to capture forever.I decided to purchase the D70 since it was close to what I've already experienced with Nikon. In many ways it works in a similar way to the N70 and 80, except it's a digital rather than film version. Like the film versions of the midrange Nikon SLR's, it has a dial that allows an automatic setting,  portrait, landscape, sports, close-up, nightscape, and night portrait modes, the ability to select aperture, shutter speed or manual controls. The camera has auto and manual focus abilities. Photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. The controls are easy to use, though it takes practice to be comfortable. On a personal level, the camera has passed the Halloween test, niece's birthday test, and fall foliage in New England test and favorite scenic spots test. The only real difficulty I've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. Auto focus has not worked at all and I'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots, but at this point I'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera.I do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. The manual is very confusing. It uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. I've had luck with the \"Magic Lantern Guides\" with my other cameras, but have not as of yet used it for this camera. I did purchase the NIKON D70 FIELD GUIDE (David Busch, Wiley Publishing) which has been helpful. It can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with Nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography.", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great, reliable camera.", "Author": "Will Rutledge", "ReviewID": "R1FREB7RUD49W1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years.

The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars.  Come on, Nikon, be real!!!Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog.  I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog.  By the time I found out, it was already at the printer.  As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great.  After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results.This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button.

Even humble the D40 blew away anything Canon had for less than the price of a used car.  What makes the D70 (and D70s) even more remarkable is that they both have the same tech as high end Nikons (ie D200, D2X series): 1/500 flash synch, 1/8000 max shutter, and 1004 point matrix metering (plus it hasn't been dumbed down like the D40, D40x, and D80 sadly have).  It also supports all of Nikon's modern lenses with AF on any that offer it (unlike the otherwise stellar D40 and D40x which require AFS).  Additionally, unlike the D100 and other previous Nikon DSLRs, the D70(s) models both support I-TTL, Nikon's most advanced lighting system.  Additionally the D70(s) can serve as a master in wireless flash situations.The camera, like almost all of Nikons, is built incredibly well, more tank than toy (I wish I could say the same for the Rebels), and it exudes confidence.  It also features a solid grip that suits my oversized hands, but I firmly believe it could accommodate more modest sized hands just as well.  Confidence is further enhanced by an uncanny responsiveness, incredible burst mode, and lightning quick focus (on my 18-135mm AF-S lens).  You really feel like a pro, even if you are just taking pictures of your cat.Compared to the D70, the D70s adds a better AF system (which can be added to the D70 with a firmware upgrade), wider flash coverage, faster transfer of pcis from the burst cache to the memory card, and a larger screen.

This camera was kept in pristine shape and shoots like a dream. The Nikon controls are easy to me but I am familiar with them from the D50. The D70s offers a few more controls than the D50 but the picture quality is still the same. The other difference is it uses the CF card compared to the SD card the D50 uses. So be aware of that. If you do not have CF cards, you'll need to buy more. Oh, also the D70s uses the DX lenses along with the regular Nikon lenses unlike the D40, D40x and D60 which can only use the DX lenses. So, if you have or are able to get a hold of some older Nikon Nikkor lenses, you should be good to use them on this body.This camera fits large in hand so if you're a bigger guy with bigger hands (or woman :-)) you will like the feel of this camera as it gives you full control of the hold.

Make no mistake, this is not a \"crippled\" D100.  The D70S features more advanced electronics than the D100 and corrects most of that fine camera's shortcomings.Incidentally, the D70S came after the initial D70 model, and features a bigger LCD viewer and more advanced firmware.  The original D70 can be upgraded via firmware to function identically to the D70S with the exception, of course, of the larger LCD monitor on the back of the camera.The D70S improves over the D100 in a number of respects.  First and foremost, to me at least, is the exposure characteristics of the D70S.  The D100 had trouble producing correct exposures in a variety of conditions, especially situations involving high contrast, for example, a room with bright windows on a sunny day.  The D70S handles such situations effortlessly, and can be depended upon to generally produce images that are ready for use right out of the camera.  Bottom line: the D70S images will usually require less post-processing than those of the D100. (This does not mean that the D100 did not produce excellent pictures; indeed it did.  But the D70S is a clear improvement from an exposure standpoint.)Additionally, the D70S has a lightning fast buffer, allowing the photographer to take pictures in rapid sequence without the camera having to stop in order to save the pictures to the CF card.  This also applies to the NEF format: the D70S saves RAW images in a nearly no-loss compressed format very quickly, which allows the user to shoot RAW images and save them compressed.  This means that the photographer can store a lot more RAW images on a CompactFlash card.  This makes shooting RAW images very practical, and is a welcome upgrade from the D100.The D70S comes with some really excellent software: PictureProject.  I was pleasently surprised how excellent this software is.  Many users will find that it is adequate for their needs and will not even want to upgrade to Nikon's Capture editor or one of the various versions of Photoshop.  Personally I find that PictureProject is great for post-processing and archiving casual snapshots, while Capture and Photoshop are better if you are trying to achieve more complex results.The D70S menus are relatively intuitive, and after using various digital cameras including the D100 I had no trouble using these menus with little recourse to the instruction manual.  Most users will have little trouble \"figuring out\" the D70S and taking excellent pictures right from the start.  Of course, all digital photographers will benefit from taking some time with the manual and learning more about the camera.  The controls on the D70S are generally well thought out, and correct some of the supposed shortfalls of the D100 setup.The D70S includes its own built-in flash, which does a good job for casual close-in snapshots and fill-flash.  Serious users will want to upgrade to the Nikon SB800 (or 600) flash.  The D70S and SB800 are truly a wonderful combination and this setup is truly a joy to use.Overall the D70S is hard to beat, and for the money it is a great deal in my opinion.

From my experience, the D40 is also noticably better at high ISOs and the auto white balance is a bit warmer.Despite these facts, I am very happy with my decision to swap to a D70s.  The external controls make the camera a pleasure to use.  It is quick to change ISO and white balance (including preset white balance and white balance fine tuning) and flash exposure compensation and flash mode, all without using menus.  These make camera operation much faster.  The matrix meter on the D70s is significantly better than the D40's.  The D40 consistently overexposes dark-coloured objects (or pets!) leading to blown highlights in the rest of the scene, and exposure compensation continually needs to be applied.  This isn't a big deal for still objects but for moving creatures you don't always get a second chance!  Another big advantage of the D70s is the ability to autofocus with AF prime lenses.  Since purchasing this camera I have bought a 50mm f/1.4 lens and it has replaced my 18-200mm as the lens I leave on the camera.  The low-light performance of this lens far offsets the slight loss in high ISO quality of the camera.

I ordered this refurbished unit last October from an Amazon seller: GRL Recoveries; it arrived a few days later and was working fine. After using it only three times OVER THE SPAN OF SEVEN MONTHS the shutter stopped working. Since the problem didn't arise until seven months after I bought it, it was way past the warranty period (after all, it was a used product). Even though I already knew the answer, I tried to do a return through Amazon. The automated response I got was, of course, \"Sorry, but the item is out of warranty, we can't help you.\" I was upset with that\u2014not because of the answer, but because Amazon's return form didn't allow enough space for me to tell my story. So I figured I'd try to email the company directly. No harm in asking. I explained to them I'd only used the camera three times before it malfunctioned. An hour later I got a personal response from GRL Recoveries by a real human. He or she said they'd see what they could do and get back to me. I figured I was done ... no company is going to take my word for it and just give me another one after seven months. Especially with a used product.Only a couple hours later I got an email from the same person at GRL (I wish I'd have gotten his or her name). I copied a line from that email and am pasting it here:\"I have a replacement on the way to you.  Can yhou please just return the one you have after you receive this one.\"HOLY CR*P! I've been dealing with computers and digital cameras well over 20 years and have NEVER gotten a response like this from anyone. I was 100% sure they were going to say \"Sorry, can't help you.\" But, not only did they give me another one, they didn't even wait to get the original one back before they sent it!The new camera arrived three days later and works perfectly. Also included were all the accessories: new battery, charger, cables and user manual. That was Saturday (this is the following Monday). During that time I've taken 2,322 shots just to test it. I didn't want to make the same mistake of waiting months to use it.I can't praise GRL Recoveries enough. And the person I dealt with was kind, courteous and prompt. Here they were taking the word of a person they've never dealt with that the item was only used three times before it went bad. And exchanged it six months out of warranty.If you're ever unsure who to buy from, go with GRL Recoveries. I doubt you'll ever find another company that will do for you what they did for me, especially on a refurbished product!Oh, about the camera ... the Nikon D70 and D70s are excellent machines that produce very high-quality image files.

I've shot almost all day on one charge. if you bring a spare battery, you'll have no worries.The LCD is on the smaller side, but its adequate for checking exposure, and you can also detect any camera shake.  No complaints. The menu system is very straightforward and easy to use.Controls on the camera body are placed within easy reach and you can change most settings without removing your eye from the viewfinder -- a big plus. Metering is usually very good, but sometimes I've had to use compensation to nail exposure. some people make this out to be a huge problem, but it really isn't. just know enough about your camera to make it do what you want it to do under any lighting conditions.I gave the D70s a four instead of five because after a couple years of use, the built-in flash seems to be dying an early death. It doesn't fire all the time anymore. Not a huge problem if you use speedlights attached to the body, but it has become a problem in the nikon creative lighting system, which is one of the reasons I wanted the camera.All in all, a wonderful camera to use. its well-built, allows for full creative control, keeps up at most events and allows for full use of nikon lenses.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "100000 and still going", "Author": "Nikon Addict \"marty\"", "ReviewID": "RIMEOHR987RWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had this camera for over 3 years, have had it on ski trips, to Costa Rica 3 time, baseball tournaments, paintball tournaments, boating and fishing.

It dodn't come with the same equipment as this one, but it did include the camera body, 2 lenses, cleaning kit, sunshade, 3 filters, a macro lens, a charger and 2 extra batteries, a mini and compact tripod, a soft case and hard travel case.Even though it came with all these accessories (the compact tripod was junk, as was the charger, the batteries didn't fit in it, and the macro lens was low-quality), the lenses weren't the same Nikkor 'DX' AF-S IF ED lenses this one comes with. My camera came with the lower quality AF-S 'G' line lenses (no ED glass elements or IF focusing).There's a lot to like about the D70S, which is an upgraded version of the D70. It was recommended to me by a freelance photographer who does work for a popular magazine (National Geographic), so I bought it on their recommendation. If I had a choice, I'd have got the Canon Digital Rebel, but this one hasn't dissapointed me. It's got all the features of a modern SLR, but with the convenience of a digital camera. Everything on this camera is adjustible: F-stop, exposure, focusing, focal lengths, white balance, shutter speeds, flash profiles, you name it. Although not as critical for beginner photographers (it does have an 'auto' mode, no tweaking requiried), there are several manual modes which allow you to adjust things.It takes great pictures for 6.1 megapixels on its own in the 'Auto' function, but if you can use the manual modes, they only get better.My only gripes with the D70S are the low MP rating (it's advertised as 6.1, the comparable Canon's are 8-10), smallish LCD display (only 2\"), and the size/weight (it wenghs almost 2 lbs for the body only-Canon's Rebels are much more compact and lightweight). Another minor complaint is that it also takes Compact Flash (CF) memory cards. They're more expensive than SD or SDHC cards as far as capacity, and larger. It's not very user-friendly either; it has taken me a while to get all the particulars of this camera down to the point they are useful.To be fair, the feature-set was advanced and the norm for 2004, but Canon makes a better camera (lighter weight, smaller, more user-friendly, easier to use).Pluses are the nearly infinite adjustibility (albeit there's a learning curve), high quality, fast start-up times, and the wide variety of lenses you can use with it. If you can afford it, avoid the standard Nikkor lenses and go for the DX line with the ED glass elements and improved IF functions or image-stabilization.Although I prefer and recommend Canon for cameras, this is a good-enough camera that once you figure out how to use it, you can start shooting pictures just like the big gun photographers!", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good DSLR", "Author": "T.
