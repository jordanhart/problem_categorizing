I have upgraded to the outstanding A570IS, which adds optical image stabilization, lower noise, and a better LCD. Check out my review of the Canon A570IS***After many years of fantastic pictures (as long as the subject was stationary!) my trusty Olympus D40-Zoom died - luckily at the end of a vacation. I spent about 30 hours researching a replacement that would satisfy my goals of (a) compact size, (b) standard AA batteries, (c) full manual controls, (d) outstanding image quality, (e) speed, (f) optical viewfinder.In my opinion, the Canon A540 fits the bill almost perfectly. It's small enough to fit in a coat pocket or small belt case yet uses 2 AA batteries. Overall processing speed is blazingly fast unless you're taking flash pictures (and then you should expect about 4-5 seconds between flashes). Note that flash time is significantly better with rechargeable NiMh batteries than with standard AAs. And, unlike some other cameras I tried, the speed of the user interface (especially during playback) is very fast.Picture quality in general is excellent, even in night situations. You have the option of ISO 80 - ISO 800 with the latter being noisy but usable. (Would you rather miss a shot completely or have a little noise? How about the ability to take a picture in low lighting without the flash?) And, you have full manual controls, in addition to the 21 predefined scene types. I'm not sold on the usefullness of the Color Swap and Color Accent modes, but the other modes are well thought out.Perhaps the biggest surprise was the movie mode, which offers up to 30 fps VGA quality 640x480 continuous shooting up to 1GB per clip, to the maximum size of your SD card. This is still no substitute for a high-quality camcorder, but it's a nice option to have in those situations where you just have the camera. (And note that unlike this camera, most camcorders offer some form of image stabilization.) Note that the movie mode on the A540 is significantly more capable than the lower-megapixel twin A530 (which is limited to 2 minute clips at 15fps).I was close to getting the Canon A700, which uses the same 6MP sensor and user interface but offers a 6x optical zoom instead of a 4x zoom. In the end, after trying both cameras in the store, I settled on the A540. Why? The A700 is ever-so-slightly larger (about 0.25 inches wider and slightly taller), and the more complicated lens takes longer to startup and to zoom. Maybe it was the lighting, but the noise quality on the A700 seemed higher than the A540, although they use the same sensor. Perhaps this has something to do with the different lenses? Finally, the A700 doesn't offer an underwater case which I'd like to have as an option some day.In summary, Canon A540 Pros:- very fast startup and shot-to-shot speed (flash not withstanding)- excellent and speedy auto-focus even in low light (although the AF assist light can slow this down)- extremely fast user interface and playback performance, even zooming in on photos- outstanding photo quality, even in relatively low light (good color balance, noise levels at high ISO are acceptable, almost non-existent chromatic aberation)- 6 megapixel sensor, 4x optical zoom- ISO 80 to 800 (800 has noticeable noise but still usable)- surprisingly usable movie mode (unlike the A530, can record up 30fps of continuous video at 1GB sections up to size of the SD card)- outstanding user interface: options are well laid out and easy to locate, very well thought-out record and playback options- full manual controls (shutter priority, appeture priority, full manual)- custom white balance option in addition to presets- flash adjusts angle based on wide-telephoto zoom- well built case, very comfortable grip- uses SD cards (and takes advantage of high-speed SD)- uses 2 AA batteries- unbelieveable battery life (approx 350 shots on 2 rechargeable NiMh AA, with the display on)- supports optional conversion lenses and underwater caseCons (to me, all very minor):- screen while large isn't very high res (85k pixels)- flash recharge time is acceptable but not great (4 - 5sec between pictures using NiMh batteries)- preview display blanks while flash recharges- it's possible to insert the SD card upside down and you don't realize until you try to close the cover (would be easy to break the cover if you force this)- the markings for the battery orientation are difficult to read- no RAW image support, but you can select from 3 different compression ratios for image quality- dubious color accent and color swap modes", "Date": "April 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "The newest and best Powershot A in the series!", "Author": "D. Reinstein \"marindavid\"", "ReviewID": "R2IKK8MKH8JI5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I began, years back, with Canon's Powershot A20 2MP), then promoted myself up to the A70 (3.2MP) about two year ago. Three days ago, I received my newest self-indulgence: the new Powershot A540 (6MP). So far, I have used it to take 40=50 shots, indoors and out, day and night, using both the Automatic and Custom settings. In every instance, I have been more than simply pleased.The 2 1/2 inch LCD display is a particularly welcome feature for me at nearly age 60 - everything is a LOT easier to see. I bought a 1GB Secure Digital card for it (Canon insists in shipping their cameras with a useless 16MB card) and a set of 2500s (NiMH batteries.)Compared to the A70, this camera is easy to manage, quite light (requiring only two batteries, not the four needed by earlier models.) A simple delete button also simplifies the immediate dumping of bad shots. The 4X optical zoom is also a welcome change to the older format.I am purely an amateur photographer.Other criticisms I have seen re the poor definition on the LCD screen are, I feel, kind of 'nit picking' - looking for something to criticize about a really good camera.I found this one online for $223. (Shipping included), sold the A70 used through Amazon for $160 in 24 hours - so the upgrade cost me about $60 net. Well worth every penny.The pictures themselves are clear. The white balance is great and I leave the setting at 1600x1200 - unless I feel I will need a poster size print. This setting allows over 1700 images on the 1GB card!I think it will do quite nicely.Light, easy to handle and good quality images. What else could we realistically hope for at this kind of price?I recommend it heartily.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "A wonderful point and shoot camera", "Author": "debrajrj", "ReviewID": "R2MRXOA8O9QI0K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The short version:This is a great camera for people who want an easily portable camera that is FAST and takes great pictures out of the box (but has some versatility for those who want to be able to do more).The long version:I'm a decidedly novice photographer, although it is something of a running joke in my family about just how many photos I take.  I was looking to replace my previous digital camera, which took great pictures of stationary objects but wasn't fast enough to catch the shot I wanted if the subject wasn't holding still-- e.g. kids at play.  I've now had this camera for a month and taken approximately 450 photos in various conditions.  Some things I've noticed:1) Battery life:  not great, but frankly better than I expected.  I'm on the third set of disposable batteries; the set that came with the camera lasted about 100 photos, and I switched out the second set a couple days ago before leaving on a trip-- they weren't \"dead\" but I figured they were close to the end of their usefulness.  Partially charged batteries are most noticable when using the flash, when they can really delay getting that next shot.  And it is GREAT to be able to use AA batteries.2) Red eye:  Wow!!! What a dramatic improvement from my old A95!  Yes, I still occasionally have to correct red-eye, but far less often.  I do have the built in red-eye reduction set to \"on\"3) Speed:  again, WOW!!!  There is virtually no shutter lag-- I press the button, and get the picture I wanted.  Ok, I've also learned to partially depress the button to focus the camera and wait for the shot I want-- but even when my subject is in motion and I don't want to pre-focus I can virtually always catch the moment I meant to catch.  Assuming I either have fresh batteries or am not using the flash, I can take the next photo just a few heartbeats later-- and I understand that there is a \"burst mode\" I haven't used which takes 2 photos a second until terminated or out of memory.4)  Ergonomics:  There are smaller cameras out there, but this will fit if awkwardly in my pants pocket.  It is significantly lighter weight than my old camera.  Controls are logical and easy to use; they don't get bumped accidentally but aren't hard to adjust on purpose.5)  Settings:  There are a multitude of pre-determined settings on this camera; I've just scratched the surface and have been impressed so far.  This lets those of us with skills best described as \"push here dummy\" get better shots under special circumstances-- on the beach, snow scenes, indoor shots, objects in motion.  The manual settings are wasted on me, but I understand they are there, too.6)  Zoom:  the 4x optical zoom means is more than you'll find most anywhere else (with a few notible exceptions).  This camera also has a on-screen icon that will blink at you if there is camera motion that might compromize your shot.  I have noticed that I just plain can't hold the camera still enough at maximal zoom to avoid having this warning flash at me.  I haven't noticed that snapshot quality was affected, but I suspect that if you blew it up to 8x10 (or perhaps larger) that you might notice it.  It does make me wonder if a 3x zoom would have been adequate for my needs, since the odds of me hauling around and using a tripod are virtually nil.  I have the digital zoom turned off on the camera; I figure I can crop if I want to after the fact but am starting with a maximal resolution.7)  Memory:  get another card.  Period.  I have a 1 GB card that I've never come close to filling despite setting photoquality at maximum resolution, but I download frequently and haven't used burst mode or video.8)  Photo quality:  Great!  I can see the individual water drops glisten in mid-air in the shots of my son splashing my husband, colors are rich and accurate.  Some shots, especially if I'm using the \"kidsnpets\" setting, are a little \"soft\"-- not quite crisp images, but I only notice this when I really blow the image up on my computer screen and I doubt I'd appreciate it otherwise.  I think if you are ordering an 8x10 or smaller you wouldn't recognize it at all.The one thing I liked better about my old canon A95:  The rotating LCD display, which was also a bit more visible in bright light (possibly because I could adjust the angle)", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "The sweet spot in Canon compact digital cameras", "Author": "Jeff Mcpheeters \"He is no fool who gives what...", "ReviewID": "R3I2F0G5ZNXKI1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was purchased to replace our stolen A520. I shoot thousands of photos per month with a Canon DSLR system, and have used other super-compact Canon and Sony digital cameras for their small size, but the sweet spot in value and performance is the Canon A5xx series, even over the A6xx series. The A6xx series (or possibly the S2 or S3) would be my recommendation for someone who wants more manual controls and is not also carrying around a DLSR (like the Rebel or 20D/30D) and knows how to shoot more creatively. But for 90% of our needs, the A5xx series is ideal for 1) its outstanding performance in Auto mode -- rarely need any post editing, 2) its compact size but large LCD display that works fairly well in daylight, 3) good performance on two AA batteries, making it ideal for traveling overseas without needing proprietary battery chargers --- does particularly well with AA Lithium batteries, 4) SD cards in 1GB-2GB are fairly inexpensive now and you get enough storage to capture an entire vacation's worth of photos on one card, 5) flash works very well indoors to 15-20 feet for normal snapshots of groups without a lot of noise (smaller cameras like the Powershot 700 or other Casio/Sony super compacts tend to have weak flash that gets noisy photos when shooting beyond 10'.Additionally, the 4x zoom is nice and can give decent 'portrait shots' with background softening, macro is decent enought for most needs, and it has easy to learn controls.One downside over the older versions: the batteries share same compartment with SD card, so it's easy to forget, when getting the SD card out, that you can also drop the batteries which isn't good, especially for NIMH, if dropped onto pavement.I've probably sold 7 of these via recommendations in the past 6 months and every single person has called to thank me. They are thrilled with the images and ease of use and the price point. One person went with the A620 on sale, and it, too, has been a good camera thus far, although it has smaller LCD -- though it flips out, and has some nice features if it's your only camera and you want to be more creative in your photography. (I would probably skip the A6xx series though, and move to the S2/S3 Canon if I wanted more pro-features in a less expensive, less complicated camera and it's not all that much bigger than the A6xx series.)", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "C. Strachan", "ReviewID": "R26ZAYE7W9O7O2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a friend who had the A510 and I loved it but it was only 3 megapixels, so I was going to buy the A520  but I decided to wait for a higher megapixel version to come out.  The A610 was too big, so I continued to wait.  Finally the A540 came out.  I read online reviews for it before it was in stores and decided that I was going to buy it.I've had it now for a little over 2 months, I haven't had any problems with it.  I've dropped it twice and I haven't noticed any defects with functionality...like with my last digital camera, after I dropped it the 1st time it stopped working properly.  Anyway this camera is great for beginners and has some stuff for people who like to go beyond using the auto button.  The start up time is good.  If you take a picture with the camera horizontally, when you're viewing the pictures, the camera automatically rotates the image to be right side up, so you don't have to turn the camera.  There are many different settings but I haven't really explored all of them.  So far I only really have two complaints:- Flash recharging time, and battery lifeIf in conditions where you have to use the flash a lot, be sure to carry extra batteries because it kills the battery much faster.  regular betteries die quickly in this camera...be sure to buy rechargeable.  If the battery is dying the flash takes what seems like an eternity to recharge which is really inconvenient at parties and other functions where people are not standing and posing to wait for you to take the picture.Oh yea and sometimes when viewing my images, the camera toggles between two images before settling to the next image.  I consider this a minor problem because it rarely happens.  I don't experience that problem with the memory card that was mentioned in one of the other reviews, if i am putting it in incorrectly it will not go in the slot, then I quickly realize that I am inserting it wrong.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "REALLY LIKE IT !!!!!!", "Author": "Nancie Marie", "ReviewID": "R3IILZRLNZ78QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Actually, I was not really interested in another camera. I have  an Olympus Camedia 3020 that still performs well. I decided to check out the smaller cameras for traveling. The clerk at Office Depot, who is into photography, recommended the Cannon 540 with a $[...] rebate ending that day and 15 day return policy. I have to tell you I bought this camera on a lark and just love everything about it. I took one picture in a dark room with just the TV on in auto mode and it came out beautiful. It even takes good pix with subjects sitting in front of a window. Also took some shots at a stadium of an outdoor graduation and they came out better than my old automatic 35mm ever took. One had a little noise, but other distance pictureS were clear as could be. Took 3 outdoor foliage close ups and they are totally awesome.  Mind you, I am still on auto here. Can't wait to read the manuals and get into some fun stuff. This camera looks to be easy to figure out. I can't believe I bought this camera without doing extensive homework and am so HAPPY!!!! Size is perfect....you pay [...]more for the same thing in a SLIM Model and have to use a battery that costs $[...] to replace. I like the fact that you can use regular batteries in emergency and don't have to travel with a docker. It is still small enought to fit into my purse. I only bought this camera 5 days ago and loved it from the get go.While I loved my Olympus, I never got off of Auto because it was so complicated.

My daughter recently got a very small slim Canon and I was impressed with the features and quality. However I wanted a camera that could use AA batteries and small size was not a top priority. I also wanted a good size LCD display and an optical viewfinder (yes, I know I'm old fashioned). This Powershot A540 seemed to have all the features I wanted. I have had it for a few weeks and have taken it on a trip where it worked flawlessly. The image quality has been very good. The movie feature is nice as long as you don't use the zoom. I recommend getting a 1GB SD card right away. The 16 MB one that comes with the camera is a joke.One of the most pleasing discoveries was that regular AA batteries lasted quite a long time. I typically don't use the LCD screen when I'm taking pictures so I'm sure that helps. I recommend taking the time to read the very detailed and complete manual as this little gem has a huge amount of features and capabilities to please any amateur/family photographer.Last but not least, Amazon offers this camera at a very attractive price not found on the street.Based on the pictures I've taken, I'd say that the quality is very good.

The images that it produces are very good. I wouldn't have expected less from Canon.However, given how much digital technology supposedly has progressed over the past 3 years, I'm somewhat disappointed.Let me explain. First off, the A540 is a replacement for a Canon A70 that finally died after 3 years. Unfortunately for me, I learned that Canon was replacing non-functioning LCD screens due to a known product defect. I only found this out after I tossed the A70 into the trash. I think that the least Canon should have done was to send an email notice to its registered A70 owners.On the subject of LCD screens, the screen on the A540 is very low in resolution. Like most screens, it's hard to see in bright light. However, even under dimmer light the image is quite grainy. Fortunately, Canon is one of the few manufacturers that still provides an optical viewfinder on some of its cameras.By far the worst problem with this camera is battery life. Compared to the A70 (with it's supposed older technolgy)battery life is very poor.I use the same NIMH batteries that I used in the A70 but don't get anywhere near the performance. Granted, the A70 took 4 batteries while the A540 takes only 2, but I would gladly have put up with the weight of the two additional AA's to get the same performance that I got with the A70.For what I intend to use it for, the A540 will serve the purpose, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I'd instead suggest the slightly higher-priced A620 which takes 4 batteries and has a higher resolution LCD screen. It's what I would have bought if anyone had it in stock.Edited 2-14-07.I finally gave up on this camera and sold it. Battery life is simply ridiculous. Spending as much time changing batteries as shooting just doesn't make sense to me.I will be replacing this camera and it may even be with another Canon. If it is, it will NOT  be a model with only 2 AA batteries.This was a very disappointing experience as I had expected more from Canon after my good experience with the A70.", "Date": "October 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Way more than I need, but I love it!", "Author": "J. Emerson", "ReviewID": "R3N6ZNTXXXJWXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the past I've always bought digital cameras based solely on price.  I would get the best camera I could afford, which ended up getting me a couple of not-very-good cameras.  The latest one died in the middle of a lovely evening full of prime photo-ops, and only 2 weeks before Christmas!  So I rushed to find a replacement.  I had to let my husband get the LCD monitor he wanted too, but it was worth it!  This time I was able to get a great camera with everything I wanted, at an affordable price!This camera has way more features than I will ever use.  Not knowing much about photography I have no use for things like manually setting the aperture or shutter speed.  But for those of you who know what to do with those settings, they are available for you to set either one at a time or all at once.I will also have no need for the underwater case, but it's available for those of you who want such a thing.  I will probably never buy additional lenses to attach to the camera, but those who are into photography can purchase an adapter that will allow you to do so.  And I probably won't mess around with changing the start-up splash screen and/or camera sounds, but if you're into that you can do that too.What I love most about this camera is the many preset scene settings that it has, making all of the manual adjustments unnecessary for someone like me.  It was great to be able to set it to Kids and Pets to take pictures of the tykes opening their Christmas presents.  The full auto setting works great too, although I'm having a little trouble getting it to focus where I want it to.  It's a great point and shoot camera, with loads of settings for the more experienced photographer.The video capture is fantastic, and allowed me to capture some really precious moments this holiday season.  The 4x optical zoom is great, although it gets a little annoying that the camera warns you about moving the camera if you zoom in pretty much at all.  I can't wait to get an opportunity to try some of the other scene settings.  So far the only bad pictures have been because someone blinked!One of the best features of this camera is the large 2.5\" LCD screen.  My previous cameras had much smaller LCDs, and the bigger LCD makes a huge difference!  And maybe it's just because I'm used to a smaller LCD, but I have no complaints about the LCD's resolution like other reviewers.The auto focus assist light has been a real life saver.  I have always  had trouble with my cameras not focusing in low light, or even medium light.  This camera hasn't had any trouble focusing at all.This camera also has a lot of fun settings I may or may not find myself using.  It has a color accent setting that allows you to select a color in the picture to highlight, and all the other colors will be converted to black and white.  You can swap one color for another.  You can take pictures in black and white or sepia, you can lighten or darken skin tones slightly (weeee, I can make myself look less pale!), you can punch up the color.  And one that will make sending pictures to my mother in law very cool when we finally buy a house, a photo-stitch function that lets you take many overlapping pictures in a panoramic fashion, and then use the photo-stitch software to stitch them together for you into one big picture.  I tried this one in my living room and it made for a fantastic view of the living room not possible with just snapshots.I've never been one to connect my camera directly to the computer and download the pictures that way.  I've always removed the memory card and plugged it into my card reader to download the pictures.  I don't even think I installed the included software with my last two cameras.  With this one I thought I'd give it a shot.  I haven't taken the memory card out of the camera since I got it.  I simply hook it up to the computer via the included USB cable, turn it on, the software pops up ready to download my pictures, and with one click they are all transferred to my MyPictures folder.  The best part is that it puts them in dated folders, keeping pictures from Tuesday separate from the pictures I took on Wednesday.  I like that!  And the Zoom Browser software is very easy to use, and I'm enjoying it a lot.  My only complaint is that the redeye correction doesn't always do a really good job.  Usually it's great, but sometimes it won't lock onto the red eye, and sometimes it makes the eye far too black.This camera uses 2 AA batteries, either store bought alkaline or NiMH rechargeables.  The batteries that came with the camera only lasted me about 20 pictures.  Luckily I had charged up some of my NiMH batteries and brought them along.  They seem to be lasting great.  I haven't had it die on me yet, although I do make sure the batteries are fully charged before I leave the house with the camera.  I see the AA batteries as an advantage over proprietary lithium batteries, like those that the Canon SD line uses.  The proprietary lithiums make the camera much smaller, but with the AA's if I forget to charge the batteries I can stop at any store and pick some up.  I wouldn't be able to do that with a proprietary lithium.  And with only 2 AAs, instead of the 4 that my last two cameras used, it's really very light weight.I really only have one complaint about this camera.  The write speed is pretty slow.  It is capable of taking advantage of high speed SD cards, but the card I have is not high speed.  I'm sure that would make a difference, and maybe the slow speed I'm experiencing is simply due to the fact that I'm not used to a 6 mega pixel camera.  But it is annoying to sometimes have to sit and wait for up to 10 seconds before I can take another picture.  I'm not sure what causes it to sometimes write really slow, and sometimes it's ready to take another picture as soon as the preview is gone.Other than that one complaint, I adore this camera.

I bought the PowerShot A 540 for personal use and I LOVE it. My parents were so interested in my camera that they purchased one for themselves from Amazon. One negative I have about the camera is that sometimes the screen is a little fuzzy when reviewing what you have just photographed but it's by no means enough of a problem to prevent someone from purchasing the camera. If you want the camera to do all the work for you, all you need do is put it on \"Automatic,\" focus and snap. Oh, the card that comes with the camera is basically useless, plan on getting a card that will hold more pictures. A++ batteries are used in the camera and even come with the camera when purchased.

Ok, if I could I would add a Preview button like Panasonic has. There, I found something I'd change if I could but there are easy work-arounds for this weakness.Anyway, the point is that I have saved enough with this purchase (and have a terrific camera for snaps) that I can indulge in something a little more elaborate for other types of shooting.

The Canon S3 IS has to go to the top of the list after the good experience I've had with the A540.Get a Canon A540; you won't break the bank and will get good family and vacation pix, etc., in the bargain.Update; I recently ordered and received the Canon pouch/case for this camera and it may be an essential accessory.

However, with that said I was disappointed with two items.  The recycle of the flash unit is painstakenly slow.  But that can with lived with except for the write speed or recycle of the camera for a follow up shot.  You can't take two consecutive pictures or even two within 2-3 seconds.The other disappointment is trying to catch an action shot.  I use the other camera for sports photography, but occasionally the A540 was all I had.  You can't catch \"a moment\" with that camera.  The focus takes 2 seconds before the shutter opens (film camera term) when you push the shutter button.  I can't get use to that slow reaction for capturing the moment.This camera is great for posed portraits and landscapes.  The focus is sharp.  The settings are good with the automatic settings.  Watch out for low light without the flash.  It will chose a slow shutter and could blur the subject.  The video recording works good (I've only used it twice).  The sharpness of pictures is fantastic.I bought a 1MB card for it because I take a lot pictures.  I will take other reviewers suggestions and try rechargable batteries.

The 540 upgraded us to 6 megapixels, 4x optical zoom (instead of 3x), more options for manual exposure control, a larger LCD screen and only half the batteries (two AA instead of 4 AA) for less weight and a smaller, lighter camera casing.GENERAL REVIEW:We've used the A540 for about 3 months and it is as good as I expected. Even with only two batteries the battery life has actually been as good or better than our older A70 that required four batteries.  (We compared battery life using the same generic NiMH AA rechargeables from our A70.)  As with our older A70, we have a significant amount of control over the A540's exposure settings.  My wife most often uses the simple point-and-shoot full-auto mode while I tend jump between various auto and manual settings depending on the shot.  We also make great use of the video recording feature -- quite nice when a full-on video camera is not handy.  [...].PROS: - Impressive number of exposure options for advanced users. - Operates on standard AA batteries. - Battery life is very good even when using flash and LCD screen. - Optical viewfinder in addition to LCD means you can turn off LCD to save battery life or to make camera use less distracting in a dark room. - Highly-rated for image quality. - Can add (some) additional lenses and/or filters if desired using a lens adapter.CONS: - Can only use SD memory cards up to 2GB in size.  With memory prices continuing to drop it would be nice to be able to use a 4GB or 8GB card in the camera.  This would be especially helpful for recording longer video clips. - The A540 ships with a tiny 16MB memory card that only holds about 10 default-resolution photos. - Card slot shares same area as batteries meaning the batteries will be loose when inserting or removing the memory card.  Not terrible but I find it annoying compared to our older Canon A70 that had separate areas for batteries and memory card. - We replaced our older Canon A70 due to problems that developed during it's 3rd year of ownership.  The A70 was well-cared for.  If we expect the A540 to be similar in other respects to the A70, we have to expect that it ay also develop age-related problems sooner than anticipated.

It is not hard to figure out how to use it.The drawbacks are typical for cameras of all the cameras of this price range, regardless brand name. (I have used Nikons and Olympus versions of the same.) The big screen on the Canon is real nice, but not bigger than other brands' version of the same camera.The drawbacks are simple:1) The flash has a narrow range of effectivness indoors. Too close, you wash out. More than 5 feet away? Too dark. You practically have to be an expert in Photoshop to be able to use indoor photos taken in medium dark to dark conditions.2) Delay. If you want to take action photos with the flash, forget it. There is a 1-2 second delay (depending on battery power). Again, you can't get around this with other brands. It is pretty much the same for all brands at this price range. This doesn't mean i don't recommend this camera, just to realize its limitations and work with and around them.3) Battery drain. The flash and screen suck out battery power faster than you can say \"cheese.\" BUY RECHARGEABLES NOW. Otherwise you will be wasting a large amount in double A's.If you are mostly taking photos in well-lit outdoors type situations, these types of cameras are great. You probably will be frustrated if you want to do more than occasional photos indoors, but again, this doesn't have to do with Canon or any particular brand.

A digital point and shoot that renders true colors. It has a very good clear view finder. Unfortunately, it has no diopter. But the view finder on this one is very clear. A lot of you may not have a problem with no diopter. I wrote to canon expressing my concern that view finders & diopters are still in demand. The LCD screen on this washes out in bright sunlight. The movies that this camera produces are very good for a camera of this type. I'm still learning about how to use the scene modes, so not much to share with you there. I do like the \"P\" mode for changing ISO settings & \"vivid\" colors. The ability to change the \"EV\" settings in certain lighting situations is a big help, as \"auto\" doesn't always achieve what you want. You have the ability to change the focus & light metering.

While the camera worked great in Automatic mode, I'm the kind of person who likes to experiment a little with photography, and the Program mode has been a great feature for me in the past.  I just returned this camera due to dissatisfaction with a feature in Program mode that I particularly like to use, Center Spot metering (focusing at a point in the very center, and then framing the picture).  In my other Canon Powershots, the A40 in particular, if I selected this feature, it would always work without issues, focusing on the center spot of the image. But with my A540, only about 40% of the time did the center spot focus, normally other ajacent areas would be focussed.  I contacted Canon Customer support, explained my problem, and the technician insisted that the camera should focus on the center as instructed all of the time, and that perhaps mine was defective.  I share this here in case others find the same trouble, so that you can return/exchange your camera while your receipt is still valid.  Many may never need to consider this if you just like the Automatic modes, for the Canon A540 is an excellent buy.  Good luck!UPDATE 11 Feb 2007I have to apologize for an error, and admit that due to ignorance I confused the Metering settings with the Auto Focus Settings.  I received an email reply from Canon indicating how to fix my problem.  Here it goes: \"...Please disable AiAF by pressing MENU, going to the RECORD tab, selecting AiAF and selecting OFF.  This will allow you to only use the center focus point.\"In short, I was mistaken, and now I wish I had not returned the camera.  But then again, I get another chance to catch another sale!

HOGG", "ReviewID": "R791OAJU3RT0I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice, solidly built, easy-to-use camera that feels good in my hand.  I got my A540 as a Christmas present a little over 5 years ago.  It blows away the camera in my smartphone, an original Verizon Motorola Droid that I got used less than 2 years ago.What I like about my A540:- Easy to use.  The menus and displays are easy to access and navigate.  Just about anyone, even non-techies, can take good pictures in Auto mode... just gotta tell them to hold the shutter down halfway for a few seconds before snapping the picture.- Takes nice still pictures and acceptable standard def. video with full resolution (640*480) and framerate (approx. 30 frames/second).- The TV-out.  My first digicam, an HP Photosmart 210, didn't even have a TV-out.- Takes AA batteries.  I keep several spare alkaline and rechargeable AA's in my camera bag.  When the ones in the camera run out, I just simply take them out and pop in a fresh set of AA's.  No need to wait for a proprietary battery to recharge.Gripes:- The flash takes a long time to recharge (maybe 5-10 seconds or so).  I really wish Canon would have sacrificed a bit of compactness and made the A540 to take 4 AA batteries instead of just two to lessen the flash recharge time.- The LCD display is almost impossible to see in sunlight- Don't get rid of your camcorder.  The video and sound quality, while OK, aren't as good as those of my Sony Digital8 camcorder that I've had for over 8 years- No image stabilization!  This makes it more difficult to take pics in low light or indoor pics with the flash turned off.- Only takes 2GB SD cards or less.  Does not accept any SDHC cards (4GB or more)If I were to upgrade, it would be either to an Canon Powershot A590 (similar to the A540 but with optical image stabilization) or to a digital SLR (their cost and bulk are the main holdbacks).", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic low price camera, great pictures!", "Author": "Matt \"Matt\"", "ReviewID": "R37Q0ZPN3D6VG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had this camera for several years and it has been great!  If this one ever breaks I am going to try to buy the same model again.  The image quality is very good, and it has an orange LED light that allows it to focus in low light and complete darkness.  Our Pentax waterproof camera does not have this, and as a result the Pentax has a horrible time focusing in low light conditions, but this Canon focuses great in the same conditions.  The focus is also very fast.  Also if you hold the shutter button half way down then it focuses, and then it will take a picture the instant you press the button all the way down.  This is great for sports or shows where you know action is \"about\" to happen.  You hold it half way to get focused, then press it all the way down the instant you want the picture and you get great pictures very easily.  The macro feature also works well for taking very close pictures.  The only negatives I have about this camera are related to the batteries; it runs on AA's and uses them up pretty quickly, and if you use regular alkaline batteries then the flash takes a little while to charge up.  More expensive cameras will use lithium ion batteries which both last longer and charge the flash much faster, but that is a different price point of camera too.  So if you're looking for an inexpensive camera, especially at the current price of $50 online, then this one is fantastic.  The pictures are great, features are good and at this price you won't loose too much sleep if you break or loose it.  I definitely recommend this for everyday snap shots!", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon Power shot Camera, WOW", "Author": "Mossy", "ReviewID": "R1N4CS9X0W4KUR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are lots of digital cameras out there now, good ones for not too much money, but Canon is the real camera maker.

Stankovic \"redsonia\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z35D7VHWBVW4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a professional photographer... I'm a person who likes to take pictures of almost everything I see :). Most of the time I have my camera with me, and I like just to point-and-shoot in order to take pictures, without any complicated setups.I have this camera for about two years now and I can recommend it highly, and here are the reasons why:- With camera, I bought rechargeable batteries with a charger... Batteries are Nickel-Metal Hydride; 1.2V 2000mAh. I can take about 500 pictures with two batteries (without a flash; with flash it take less pictures). Camera takes two AA batteries, and I have 4 of them, so I always have backup in case I need one... but since they are only AA batteries, even if backup goes off - I just go to any store and buy some more.- With this camera, I bought 1Gb of memory which is quite a lot of storage space, but since I'm taking a lot of pictures and videos, I have one more 1Gb memory (as a backup). It's very easy to replace memory card - almost the same as replacing batteries.- Picture quality is very good. I take pictures from a moving car (my husband is driving), and the pictures are very sharp. I was taking pictures during rain, and on the pictures I can see rain drops! Also, there are no red eyes.- Video quality is amazing! The microphone (located: small holes above lense, oposite from flash) picks up sound really great. When I play the video on my PC, video and sound quality are really amazing - considering that this is \"only\" Canon PowerShot Digital Camera...- Size is great. Not very small so it's not easy to missplace it, and not big - easy to put in my bag or a jacket pocket. It's also not heavy, so it's easy to carry it around.- Canon PowerShote A540 is a \"point-and-shoot\" camera. In order to take picture, you need to press \"On\" button, to point and press button to take picture... it's that simple, and quite fast. It slows down (you need to wait sometimes few seconds between pressing button to take picture and actually taking the picture) when batteries are low; I also noticed delay sometimes when Flash=\"Auto\" and when light is not so bright, so I a have feeling that camera 'is thinking' if the flash should go off or not.- I like that it has 4x zoom, however, when I use zoom, my hand needs to be really-really still in order to get a clear picture - slightest movement will make picture fuzzy.One con from my side is that display is not protected... after two years in my pockets/purse, I can see light scratches on the display.This camera has many modes/options... buy honestly, for my picture taking needs, I'm not even using them - I tried them out, but for every day use, I use modes: \"Auto\" (for pictures) and \"Video\" (for video)... and that's about it.Overall, when I look at my previous 2 yrs experience, price, and all features provided, I must say that this is a great camera and I would recommend it to everyone who wants good quality photos with only Point-And-Shoot.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Medium quality, good customer service.", "Author": "Oleg Gleizer", "ReviewID": "R2CCHS35T5DKKP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera worked for a half of a year.

The only thing is when I try to take pictures at night without the flash - when the ISO is too high, the pixellisation kind of ruins it for me.

Technologies moving fast and all. About the battery... if you are the type to snap loads of pictures at once, you may think the autonomy is not that great - at least, when the batteries are out, the camera still manages to shut down properly...The good things about this Canon here are that it's pretty handy and that it can be trusted to last a long time.

But I have been doing my homework...First the good stuff:--I have to say the battery usage, or lack thereof is incredible.  I bought rechargeable NiMH batteries and I have managed to fill up a 2GB card two and a half times with photos and video (occasionally using flash, almost always with the LCD on) and I have only had to replace the batteries _one time_.  On a typical day of shooting for 3-4 hours I may replace the batteries one time.  This was an issue I was concerned about, but I have been incredibly surprised, impressed and overjoyed by this.  With the regular alkaline batteries that came with the camera, I took only 200+ pictures with the LCD on, flash on part of the time.--6MP and 4x optical zoom, thats pretty good for cameras today.  For most consumers this is as much as you will ever need, perhaps more than you need.  Of course, give it a year and all the cameras will have 8MP and 6x.--The user interface is pretty intuitive and easy for the average user to figure out, especially if you have used Canon before.  The only camera I have ever used was my mothers A70 and I was easily able to navigate through the controls to do what I needed.--The pictures look very good, the colors are beautiful and generally they are very sharp.  The pictures I took last fall were very good.  I found some of the automatic \"scene\" settings to be helpful as well, the \"foliage\" setting worked great to put emphasis on outdoor colors.--An advantage over the A530: The user can manually select things like shutter speed and aperture priority.  There is also an auto setting.  For someone who is trying to learn photography a little instead of simply take pictures, this has helped me to experiment.  Often I find that at times I may want less exposure time and am willing to sacrifice some brightness for the resulting sharpness.--The camera does feel light and rather small in the hand, but its comfortable to hold.A Few cons:--Probably the main problem that would affect most people is that 5-7 second delay when using the flash.  I can see how this would be an issue for some people who have children or want to take a lot of pictures in darkly lit areas.  I rarely do this but if you are wanting to take a lot of pictures with flash in succession, this could be a major issue.--In low light settings the photos are not great, something I had read about ahead of time in reviews.  Taking good pictures on a rainy or overcast day can be a challenge.  I was surprised how good some pictures looked when I recently went out on a dark foggy morning and took pictures.--In movie mode there is noticeable motor noise picked up by the microphone when the camera adjusts to light changes and when zooming in and out.  A minor quibble for those mostly wanting to take photos, but may be an annoyance for others who occasionally want to shoot video with the camera (like me, although I am not overly concerned with high quality video as with high quality pictures).  A side note, movie mode does tend to take up a lot of memory, but you have the option to take fewer frames per second (15fps/30fps) and you can decrease the resolution.--The memory card included with the camera is pretty worthless.  Canon has included 16MB cards with cameras ever since the A70 and before, and yet the number of megapixels has more than doubled.  Is it not time to increase the size of the card included?  I found a good deal on a 2GB card and with that on the highest resolution and quality compression rates it will hold around 750 pictures.--There are two instruction manuals included, one is a basic manual and the other a \"advanced.\"  I have to say that the advanced one is not as detailed as I would like.  It explains what things do without telling you exactly why you would like to use this or that setting or when.--Another minor quibble, I have noticed some \"barrel distortion\" (if you don't know what that is you probably do not need to worry about it, or you can look it up online) on close up pictures, this inevitably happens with every camera though, and is probably no more exaggerated here than with others.The value for the money with this camera is very good.

I consider it a huge advantage that the A540 uses 2 AA batteries. I have several sets of rechargeables and I can get a lot of pictures from each set. Also, a big advantage of AAs over specialty batteries is that if you are on a trip or have an emergency and need batteries fast, you can purchase AAs almost anywhere in the world.  One other thing I have always appreciated about my Canon is never having trouble downloading the pictures. I can connect my camera to any computer running XP and my camera has always been detected. This has not been true of other brands of digital cameras at the place where I work.  I also purchased a 2 gig SD memory card. This is the maximum size  card that you can use with the A540. I did not get the most expensive, high speed card and so far I have not noticed any problems.

However I felt compelled to post this review and specifically address my experience with the A540's battery life: mine has been excellent. We are a family of 6, high income, tech/gadget group. Between us, we currently have 8 digital cameras in use. Various brands and models, Fuji, Canon, Nikon both pocket & DSLR and Kodak. We are very happy with Canon. I too did a lot of research before buying and went to several stores for a hands on. Price, for me, was no object- I just wanted a good camera that felt right. My hand kept coming back to the A540. I love mine.I have taken lots of pictures under various conditions including some video. All have turned out well. We do not experience blur and my batteries last a good long time. In the last year I have only changed the batteries three times. The camera can set, turned off and in it's bag, for over a month- I get it out, take 2-3 pictures, come back in a month and do the same and it's always ready to go. I have upgraded to the highest NiHi batteries I could find and a 1 gig. card.I put this in the 1 Star group because I wanted the people reading the negative reviews first, as I do, to understand that these are not typical problems , that people  are complaining about.No, I'm not affiliated with Canon in any way.
