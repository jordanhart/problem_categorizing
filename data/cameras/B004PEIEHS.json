{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Vivitar Very Poor Cameras", "Author": "Honch", "ReviewID": "RFWRJ9MN1UL0N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife purchased 2 different models of Vivitar cameras as Christmas presents. One for our 5 year old son and another more expensive model for her mother. I could not believe how poor the image quality was on both of them. I immediately returned the more expensive model. Unfortunately we lost the packaging for our sons and are stuck with it. Now I know that we bought a cheap camera for our son and I did not have high expectations. However the pictures are terrible. Completely pixelated with terrible colors. Just awful. Not even fun to look at. I just can't believe that at this point in time any company is still marketing a camera this poor. Vivitar should be ashamed!", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "bad cameras", "Author": "softball", "ReviewID": "R5FYOAYDEMNCI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We cannot use these cameras at all.

This one was extremely cheaply made - very light plastic. It would easily break if dropped.  Also, when you took a photo, the image immediately disappeared and a time-passage indicator filled the screen, so a child would no longer see the image they focused on and wouldn't know that the pic was still processing.Very poor camera!", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "blech", "Author": "leaf", "ReviewID": "R2NWNH12AA2YS2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Piece of crap.picture is so blurry.my phones camera beats this camera in the ground.but I was the idiot who bought a 30 dollar camera expecting anything more than terrible.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vivitar V5118-BLK-PR 5.1MP Digital Camera with 1.5-Inch TFT LCD (Black)", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R1LJZZCITID5ST", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's ok for what I use it for.

Pictures not the sharpest. I will probably wait a few yars until my grand daughter gets older and then buy her a better camera. Camera lacks many features flashpicture stability etc., but fine for teaching the basics, It will get passed down to younger sisters to learn how to use.

It feels extremely light weight and fragile. The image snaps so slowly if you move after hitting the button, your photos are blurry.  In the age of digital cameras, this should not be an issue. This camera goes through batteries extremely quickly as well.I cannot stress the need to avoid this camera strongly enough.
