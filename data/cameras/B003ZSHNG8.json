{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Fantastic Compact Zoom Choice", "Author": "J. Whiteside", "ReviewID": "R3CNF4IGX47TZT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll start by saying that I'm a Canon fan.  Three out of four of my current digital cameras, including both my DSLR's, are Canon.  When I was looking to upgrade my compact zoom, this unit caught my eye for both its price point and its feature set.  For a sub-$200 compact zoom, this camera definitely leads the pack.Pros:* 12 megapixel image capture* Very good image quality* Full 720P HD video capture* Excellent low light performance for its class* Excellent image stabilization capability* Full manual control, including Av, Tv and full manual modes* Great zoom range, especially at the wide end* Excellent, fast and intuitive performance* Reasonable battery performance with rechargables (a MUST!)* Works with convenient AA batteries* Excellent flash for its class* Excellent color fidelity with no detectable image artifacts* Fast continuous shooting for a compact camera* Perfect size for a compact zoom, fits in a large pocket* Fantastic price/performance ratioCons:* No CCD cleaner that I've found* No flash shoe for an external flash* No external audio inputs for video capture* 10 minute video capture limit* No RAW image support* Terrible support for HD video codec* No optical/digital viewfinder / LCD display only* My unit got a speck of dust inside the lens, creating a spot on images/video for awhileIt's been a couple years since I've purchased a camera and I was a bit surprised to see how far the feature sets have come, especially on the lower-end compacts.  I've now put this camera through the paces in many different situations and overall, I'm very pleased with everything about it so far.My criteria for this camera purchase was fairly simple.  I wanted a compact zoom with decent optical range, AA battery support, excellent color fidelity, reasonable low light performance and a unit that provided full manual control.  I'm an amateur/semi-pro photographer and I expect a lot from my cameras.  After reviewing the options out there, this one was a clear winner.First, I'll speak to the image quality and zoom.  I've been very impressed with both its color fidelity and the overall image quality.  Images are sharp and its ability to provide vivid color and great dynamic range within images is fantastic.  With the unit's lack of RAW support, this was very important to me.  At the low end of the zoom, there is a bit of the wide-angle effect...but I really appreciate how wide this camera is able to go.  At the far end of the zoom, the optical quality is still great and I haven't detected any weak spots within the optical range.  I've never been impressed with digital zoom, and I nearly always avoid it...but as is typical with digital zoom, you'll get artifacts at the furthest end of the spectrum.  For a compact, the macro mode is also quite functional, allowing a very short focus range of less than 1/2\" - and the 2\" focus minimum for normal mode is also quite impressive.Aperture performance was up to my expectations for a camera lens of this quality, if not even a little better than I expected.  The range is from f/3.4 to f/8.0 in aperture priority mode, and I typically would want more on the far end, but as far as I'm concerned, this camera produces f/22 and above quality in landscapes.  You're not going to get beautiful bokeh effects at the low end (f/3.4) but this is typical of compact cameras with inexpensive lenses.  With that said, though, I was surprised to see any bokeh whatsoever...and it is possible to get a little.Low light performance is important to me as this is one of my strongest interests in photography.  Up to ISO800, there is very little noise in the captured images and I've found that my noise filters will clean up what little there is quite well.  ISO1600 starts to introduce a fairly strong noise characteristic, but I expected as much.  There is no ISO3200 support, but personally, I feel like this is a waste in a camera at this price point as there's no way you're going to get good performance at such extremes.  The image stabilization works well, especially when you're right on the edge of needing a tripod.  The camera features an auto focus assist beam, which is a welcome addition within a camera at this price point.  Low-light video performance was quite good, although it does take a performance hit in the noise department...but I was still very impressed that it performs as well as it does by producing very watchable low-light video results.The overall feature set for a relatively inexpensive compact is just staggering to me.  All of the basic features are there for a person who appreciates some creative control, including full Tv, Av and manual modes.  The automatic modes are great for those times when I don't want to put effort in and P-mode (full auto, except for control over ISO) was an absolute necessity for me.  The time-to-live is quick and from an off-state, I can capture an image in less than 3 seconds.  I've tested some of the newer, fancier features and I have to say, they're quite impressive.  The smile detection blew my mind because it actually worked!  The ability to auto-shoot portraits when new people enter the scene is also pretty amazing to me.  Blink detection?  I would have never thought of that, but it's actually worked for me in a couple of cases.  The HD-video is a great addition to my camera lineup and I've started playing with it fairly extensively.  I have noticed a bit of discrepancy between the image stability on the LCD screen and the actual result in the produced video, but then again, if I wanted super-stable video, I'd use a tripod.  There is a 10 minute limit to video capture, which could be a deal breaker for some, but for my purposes it's just fine.  It picks up audio quite well, which was surprising to me - although you're not going to get movie studio quality out of the thing.Physically speaking, the camera is very comfortable to hold and all of the buttons are conveniently placed.  Anyone who's used a Canon camera will feel quite at home with it...and even if you're not, I wouldn't anticipate much difficulty.  I haven't had any notable difficulty with the button placement, but have inadvertently turned off the camera when I was trying to capture a picture in a hurried situation.  It's not exactly a sub-compact, but for a compact zoom, the size is perfect and exceeds my expectations.  (It fits in a large pocket quite easily, but not well in smaller ones, such as most rear pockets.)  The lens retraction is very nice and the lens portion only sticks out about 3/4\" from the body when fully retracted.Battery performance met my expectations, for the most part.  The use of rechargeable batteries is a must for any digital camera - it's no secret that ALL digital cameras suck up a lot of juice.  (This is WHY most of cameras use proprietary NiMH batteries!)  For me, I'm fairly heavily invested into NiMH AA batteries, so it was very important for this purchase to support them.  I don't get the rated performance, but I never trust those values and I can certainly squeak 200+ images out of a set of 2300mAh batteries, without flash usage.  Video use does suck up the juice, but I've still been surprisingly impressed with its performance as I expected a lot less.  I wouldn't really consider using standard alkaline batteries in a digital camera for all but a pinch situation and if you expect good performance on alkaline batteries, you're not going to get it.  I did find the camera did not like a couple of my sets of 2700mAh batteries, and wouldn't even turn on...and while that bugged me, it wasn't a deal breaker as it does work with 90% of my batteries.  A quality battery charger/tester goes a long way, as you won't get good performance if your batteries aren't up to snuff and aren't properly matched according to actual capacity.I really only have a couple of complaints.  Somehow my unit got a fairly large spec of dust inside the lens, and for awhile, all my images/video had a blurry spot on them - particularly in images with fairly strong light/midrange backgrounds.  I'm a little concern about the seal and its ability to prevent dust from entering into the lens.  Eventually, this speck of dust went away and my images are back to normal - but it's frustrating when you can't do anything about something like this.  Additionally, the HD video codec that is used by this camera (H.264/Apple Quicktime MOV) is very frustrating to work with on a computer.  It's just not well supported yet and takes a LONG time to open on my computer, even within Apple's quicktime application.  (My machine is a quad-core 3.2Ghz proc, 4GB RAM...fast, for all intents and purposes - perhaps I have an issue with my computer's video codecs and I am willing to concede that possibility.)  With that said though, I've found it best to convert it to a different format for editing...a step that I would rather avoid.  These two issues prevented me from giving the product a full five-star rating.Overall, though, I'm impressed with this camera and it fit the bill perfectly for me.

After reading a few reviews, it had me convinced that this would be worth waiting for. I received my SX130is late this morning- and have to say, right from the box it was just amazing. Every time in the past when purchasing a new camera, it takes some adjusting and \"breaking in\" before fully great-quality pictures come, but with this one, literally from the first shot it has been wonderful. The HD video also records wonderfuly, and the sound is great as well- even with using all of the 48x digital zoom! The one \"downside\" to the video mode is that the image doesn't auto-focus as you zoom in, at times you have to re-focus using the shutter just as you normally would when taking a picture, but I personally didn't find that too annoying once I figured it out. The miniature and fisheye modes are a blast to use, and the smart-shutter mode (takes the photo when a smile is detected, without using the shutter) is neat too. The LCD is a nice big size, and has an auto-rotate for images in the playback mode, as well as an option to scroll through them when selecting. A fun fact which I also noticed is that it has a \"screensaver,\" which displays the time to save the screen (as a computer would). Although some might consider it a bit \"bulky\" compared to most compact point and shoots, the size is perfect for someone like me who has bigger hands, allowing for a decent grip and non-clumsy hold. Overall, I just absolutely LOVE this camera (which I why I already give it 5 stars, hands down). Definitely recomend this to anyone; is well worth the money!***Updated on 9/24***After finally getting some Rayovac recharcable NiMH batteries, I can finally say that this camera is well worth the money. If you use regular AA (nonrechargeable) batteries, it will blow through them like crazy, so I learned the hard way. But the NiMH last much, much longer, plus are rechargeable. If you plan on purchasing this camera, I would highly recommend also getting the batteries- it is well worth the extra money.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb mini all-rounder", "Author": "Clint", "ReviewID": "R2ZIEDXU9IFLDV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera mainly because it was reviewed as having good pic and video quality, it has HD video, and it takes AA batteries.  So far it's been superb all round.The AA batteries bit is a really big deal for me.  I so nearly bit the bullet and got a camera that uses a proprietary battery pack -- as, tragically, they almost all do now -- only to discover, when trying to get 2 spare packs, that they're basically unobtainable!  This makes such a camera useless for me, as on a long trip (e.g. weekend hike), once the battery is dead, you're stuffed until you find a 110v outlet to charge from.I understand that AAs are more bulky for a given charge, and presumably that's why the SX130 only takes two.  I'd personally take a larger handgrip to make room for two more batteries, but the bottom line is, it doesn't really matter.  Just take along spares, and change them out as needed.  Use NiMH batteries for best life (conventional batteries like Duracells simply can't handle the loads of a digital camera), but in a pinch, you know that more charge is almost always going to be easily available.  And when rechargables wear out, getting new ones is a snap.So anyhow... I basically love the camera.  It's compact and light, and easily fits in a jacket pocket, so it's always handy for a snapshot.  It takes great pictures, and superb clear 720p movies.  The stereo sound is good, but with built-in mics, wind noise will always be a problem if there is much wind at all.  You can zoom while filming, but the noise is quite audible on the soundtrack (though subtle enough not to be really annoying, mostly).  I've started using a separate sound recorder for projects where I care about the live sound.The reason for dinging one star is the one niggly point I've found to date: video capture is limited to 9 mins 59 seconds per clip.  This is a hard and consistent limit; I guess it's to avoid the 2GB file size limit.  It's never been a problem for me so far, but I could see where it could become an issue for some types of filming.Battery life isn't great, but like I said, just carry two or three (or ten!) sets of spares, easy.  For the record, here's what I got on a single set of Eneloops, taking continuous 10-minute video clips until it died: battery warning came on at 80 minutes; batteries died at 110 minutes.  One 16GB memory card stored 85 minutes of video, averaging 186 MB per minute.  I'm using a 32GB card now (class 10), and it works great.In case you're wondering what it records in the .MOV files it captures, ffmpeg tells me that the video format is:  Video: h264, yuv420p, 1280x720, 22301 kb/s, 29.97 fps  Audio: pcm, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 1536 kb/sSo overall, great.  I do wish there was more choice of cameras taking standard batteries; but this one fits the bill nicely.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great features and pictures, but returning due to battery life", "Author": "Mike.

The S3 takes awesome pictures but is a bit bulky, so I wanted to try this new camera. Well, I love the picture quality, features, controls, weight, construction and especially the HD video. However, I have to return it. This camera goes through a set of Duracell batteries about every 50 shots. I shot about 8 minutes of video today before the camera shut down due to dead batteries. You need to have at least 4 extra batteries with you at all times, otherwise you're going to get stuck. I tried higher capacity rechargeables and the camera wouldn't even acknowledge them.

I was going to go with the sx120is, but it did not have HD video like all the other cameras had on them. Will I use that much, maybe, maybe not, but I at least wanted that option since all the other new cameras have it. Then I found out why the sx120is was going down in price, to make way for the sx130is. I looked everywhere and no one had it in stock yet. Then amazon got it a couple days later and I ordered it. Right away I thought it looked great. Very nice, something to hold onto, unlike the new small size cameras-I just don't like that they are so tiny. Love the big screen on the back. I thought I would miss not having a viewfinder and only using the rear display, but then i thought about it-I only use the display anyways on my camera and never the viewfinder! Sometimes the display looks grainy when not enough light, but after seeing the shot I just took, the pic was perfect. I like that it uses 2 AA batteries since I use rechargables-my other one used 4, so I have 2 extra for a backup now. I love how it zooms in on the face and the smile shutter is a neat trick. Have not played with the hd video yet, but I would have liked a mini-hdmi out of the camera. Also would like the flash to pop up on its own instead of saying on the screen to put the flash up. Other than that, there are so many controls, I'll probably never use them all and mainly use it on auto, which is great! The 12 MP and 12x optical zoom is great. Just note the 4x digital zoom does not work in widescreen mode, but it never did on my other camera either. A great camera to get without paying the extra money for the D-SLR cameras.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Terrific Travel Camera", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R2RPCBN74LULLJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My guess:  if a professional photographer were going on a week-end trip, and wanted to travel light with just ONE camera and lens, the SX130 might be that camera.  No $200 camera does a better job of producing high quality photos outdoors in good sunlight.If I am spending a week-end in an interesting place, I may take 300 or 400 photos a day.  Most small cameras use expensive proprietary rechargeable batteries, so you need an extra $50 battery.  The SX130 uses AA batteries, available at most corner stores around the world.  That means you are never left without a battery.  The SX130 eats throw-away AA batteries like popcorn.  If you take only 250 or 350 photos per year, use lithium AA batteries, as they provide about 400 photos per set, if 10% or 20% of your photos use flash, and lithium batteries last for years when not being used.The most affordable option is a set of  \"pre-charged\" rechargeable batteries.  Two \"pre-charged\" batteries such as the Sanyo Eneloops, provide about 250 outdoor photos, so a set of four get you through a week-end trip of 500 photos before you need to recharge.  With heavy use of the flash, two pre-charged battereis will last about 100 photos, so for a wedding or party, bring along two extra pre-charged batteries.  A package of four pre-charged AA batteries sells for under $15 and will last two or three years of heavy use.The SX130 has an \"easy mode\" that permits even a child to take great photos outdoors, after learning to pre-focus before taking the photo.  And, the SX130 has dozens of manual settings that enable experienced users to set a custom white balance, set the ISO level, adjust contrast, color tone, and color saturation.If a user takes a few hours to work through the 140 pages of the owners' manual with the camera in-hand, practicing each of the settings, it becomes easy to learn how to dial-in precisely the photo you want.  In bright sunlight, the SX130 can take photos that look very much like those from a $1,000 DSLR camera.The SX130 is too big and heavy to put in a pocket, but it is much smaller and lighter than a DSLR...no DSLR comes with the powerful ultra-zoom lens of the SX130...a lens that ranges from a wide angle, for taking a photo of the interior of a room, a large group of people or of a large building...and a powerful telephoto that provides a sharp view of a seagull that is a hundred yards away.The flash of the SX130 is designed to work best with subjects that are three feet to seven feet from the camera...if you keep your subject close to the camera, the flash can yield good results.  WARNING: it feels like a week before the flash recharges...but it is only ten seconds...not the flash for pictures of kids playing or dogs running.  This is a flash for taking photos of subjects who are willing to sit still...for a long, long time.There are other cameras selling for under $200 that are much smaller than the SX130.  However, no camera selling for under $200 provides its combination of a powerfull ultra-zoom lens, the option using full manual controls, and produces outdoor photos that look like they were taken with a professional DSLR camera.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very close to perfect...", "Author": "A.

My father is a professional photographer, so I know a thing or two about cameras.Actually, of course, every year they make the cameras better and entice buyers like me. This one has the HD video, and the 12x zoom, and 12.1 megapixels. Both features sold me. The SX110is now goes to my wife who has a fine collection of fairly new electronics that I discard annually.The quality of photos is spectacular. The color is far superior to any camera in a comparable price range, especially a simple point and shoot. My 3 week old daughters skin tones show up amazingly realistic.HD video is a plus. I am not sure how much I will use since I have an HD camcorder, but still, in a pinch it is nice. My only issue with the camera is the placement of the 'video' mode, so far from the 'auto' mode on the dial selector. This makes it inconvenient to switch back and forth, which is the main reason why I will probably not use the video mode as much, and the reason why I proclaim that this camera is 'very close to perfect', and not just perfct.Canon has never let me down.

I was looking to replace the canon P&S; that I was currently using with something that was a little bigger, that had a better flash and Macro settings. (For product listing photos)This review is going to touch on a couple cool features that I like for the sake of eBay.1. The macro capabilities on this thing are amazing! In Manual mode with Macro on, you can have the lens 1/2\" away, and it will still lock focus and snap a photo. The best Macro that I personally have seen.2. Again in Manual mode, I LOVE the fact that it shows you exactly what the picture will look like before you take the picture. If your ISO is low, you shutter speed too quick, and it is darker, your screen will show you how dark the picture will be. Turn the iso up, put the shutter speed slower, and the image on the screen gets brighter letting you know you are getting a better shot.No more taking the picture, looking at it, deleting it, re-doing settings and then doing the process all over again.Which by the way, is also helpful if you are at a wedding or an event where you only have 1 chance to get the shot.The reason I only give it 4 stars, is the battery life. However, after I blew through the 2 provided batteries after 1 hour, I put in rechargeables that have lasted all day so far.Everything else with the camera is fun to play with. The minature effect has gained popularity in the past couple years. If you go to google images and search for \"Tilt Shift\", you will see what it does. It works best when you are higher up, taking a photo of city scapes, buildings, cars, people etc. A lot of people will do a fake \"Tilt Shift\" photo with photoshop.This review as stated above, is more for how I use it with eBay.

I brought another excellent little Canon I have and took pictures, at dusk, of some buildings. The difference was very obvious. The SX130 pictures had way more light than the smaller camera. If you ask me the AA (which it does eat) batteries are an advantage. You can buy replacements everywhere if you don't have a power plug. You can buy your own rechargeable batteries for very little money. With other cameras if something goes wrong with your battery you have to order a new one, for $40-$100 dollars, with SX130, no problem. I used a mulit battery charger to charge my wife's new Sony camera, the battery never worked in the camera again. Some chip in the battery got messed up. Had to buy a new one.Picture queasily is excellent, but don't rely too much on presets. Especially low light setting. Use P mode and control the camera, decide what ISO you want to use. All of these cameras bump up the ISO high to get low light photos, but this just results in more noise.I read in some reviews that the flash is a bit slow. It may be on the first shot, but after that it recycles just as fast as on other cameras. It is a little big to call pocket camera, but I use it as a secondary camera, \"for better pictures\".Overall I think camera delivers what it promises. It doesn't pretend to be small, but it gives you the versatility of AA batteries and, if you know how to use it, takes excellent pics. It turns on in a fraction of a second and is ready to use.

If you primarily value really great picture quality and zoom ability, then this is a great choice in the under 200 USD range.BTW, I've heard a lot of people support a particular brand of rechargeable batteries (Sanyo Eneloop). I think they are 2000mAh though; you can get 2500mAh - 3000mAh from a number of companies. So don't just take the first recommendation, you may be able to do 50% better (capacity wise).BTW BTW, there might be a couple useful features that some casual users missed. You can enter a continuous shot mode, but I don't think it works in \"auto\". You can also adjust flash power, but not in auto mode. You will want to venture out of auto mode (even if you don't know it yet), this camera has compelling reasons to. I don't know that it is the right camera for people with (D)SLRs ambitions though. If you just want to take one step up from total PNS, then this is a great choice. If your final destination is definitely (D)SLR, then you might want to look elsewhere.

The deal breaker for me, however, is the flash recycle time. If you take a flash photo you will need to wait a good 10 seconds before taking another one. This might not be all that much longer than similar cameras statistically, but the key point is that while the flash is recycling the view screen is blank - meaning you can not even begin to compose your next photo while you wait. Instead you must stare at a blinking yellow light informing you the flash is recycling. In contrast, with most other cameras I've used you don't even know the flash is in the process of recycling because you are busy lining up the next shot. In these cases if you are too quick to hit the shutter release, the camera will be unresponsive for a second or two, then fire, and you don't think too much about it.Decide for yourself, but personally I think this flaw makes this camera unusable for flash photography.

However, with age, the old hands aren't as steady as they used to be so it was time to get a new camera with image stabilization.The four most important criteria for a replacement camera was it needed to fit in my purse (not too difficult since the old HP was a bit bulky), it needed to have image stabilization, it needed to use SD cards, and it needed to use AA batteries. The SX130 IS appeared to meet those needs. It is only a bit larger than the old HP, not enough to be a problem, uses SD cards, and uses AAs like I wanted (I already carry spare AAs in my purse). I also was fairly confident that, being a Canon, it would be a high quality camera like my SX10 IS has proven to be. Favorable reviews also reinforced my decision.This camera makes my old HP look sick (and it was a nice little camera; I gave it to a friend's son). Even when using one of the auto modes, pictures came out sharp and bright in good lighting conditions. When using the semiautomatic and manual modes, I can get surprisingly good pictures for a small point and shoot. Indoors, the flash is better than the old HPs flash. It also does better in low light without flash than the old HP or even my SX10 IS (and it's no slouch!). The 12x optical zoom was a bonus over the HPs 3x. Battery life is excellent. I use Sanyo Eneloops and it seems like I never have to replace them (of course, I do but I can go a long time between battery changes). It fires up quickly so I'm less likely to miss a shot. I've never had a problem with dust on the inside of the lens that some have reported. There is no limit on the size SD card I can use. The 8GB cards I use are actually overkill.One thing this camera is much better at doing than my old HP (or even my SX10IS) is using it as a portable scanner. As long as the light is fairly decent, I can copy documents, magazine articles, etc. without too much trouble. The \"scans\" aren't as good as a real scanner but they are quite usable and they sure beat a lot of note taking.I do have a few minor complaints. Not surprisingly, pictures are saved as JPEGS. While normally not a problem for a point and shoot, the compression is higher than it was for my old HP. That can limit the amount of editing that can be done. Fortunately, pictures come out so well, little to no editing is needed other than some cropping so the pictures will fill my computer monitor and 32\" TV screens where I normally view them (I rarely print my pictures).The zoom can be a bit slow to react at times but not as bad as some people have reported. It hasn't been enough of a problem for me to worry about.The location of the tripod mount is a bit awkward. My tripod uses quick change shoes. I was able to trim a shoe slightly to allow it to fit permanently on my SX10 IS and still open the battery door but there was no way to do so on the SX130 IS. I rarely use the camera with the tripod so I just keep a shoe in my purse so I'll have it if I need it.The controls and settings of the SX130 IS are similar to my SX10 IS but there are some differences that are annoying since some settings on one does something slightly different or even opposite of the other. It's a pity Canon couldn't have standardized their settings between cameras. It wasn't too big of a problem once I got used to it but for a short while, it drove me nuts.The LCD screen on the SX130 IS is actually a bit bigger than on my SX10 IS. There is no view finder on the SX130 IS so the larger screen is nice (it's twice as big as the one on my old HP). The LCD screen sets flush on the camera body (actually, almost proud), unlike the slightly recessed screen on my old HP) which makes it more susceptable to damage when taking it out of my purse and shoving it back in (the fit is a bit snug). Since there isn't room in my purse to allow me to use a camera case (which would be a nuisance anyway), I had to use a screen protector to protect the screen. I'm on the third screen protector now and, so far, the screen still looks brand new. I've seen complaints about the lack of a viewfinder but I haven't found it to be a problem. I find viewfinders awkward because I wear glasses so I rarely used them anyway. The camera is small enough I can use my left hand to shield the screen and still maintain a good grip on the camera.None of these complaints are enough to dock any stars, especially since this camera does so exceptionally well otherwise for a small point and shoot that will fit in a purse or even a pocket. Many of the complaints I've seen for this camera appear to be because people expect too much from it. It's not a DSLR and it would be unreasonable to expect it to perform like one. It doesn't have an external flash so it isn't going to be as bright as one and recovery time is going to be slower. It's a small, easy to use camera for taking snapshots that are better quality than any camera phone is likely to ever take, especially if one uses the more advanced settings in adverse conditions (and how many camera phones have 12x zoom)? If I need better quality pictures or I have to take them in really tough conditions, I'll use my SX10 IS, the one that is too big to fit in my purse or pocket, even when I don't have the external flash attached to it.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "S.

It offers a decent set of manual controls. Image quality is excellent with good color accuracy and decent sharpness. I found the controls very easy to use. There's been some complaints about the camera's size but in my opinion it allows for a better grip when shooting. Obviously it takes the best pictures in manual mode but the ones taken in Auto weren't half bad either. I was able to get decent shots out of this camera up to and including ISO800... not so much at ISO1600 but I can't really be upset that a point and shoot at this price can't take decent pics at that high ISO (that's where the DSLR comes in).It's highly reccomended that you get some NiMH rechargeable batteries for this camera. It will eat through batteries. And also autofocus and shot-to-shot times are leisurely. I like the manual pop-up flash feature - some people don't, but it gives you more control over your pictures.I honestly did not test the HD video in this camera but from what I've seen it holds up pretty well in this regard.One thing the manual shooters might not like is that there is no middle ISO setting between ISO800 and ISO1600. I found that slightly annoying but I do most of my shots at ISO800 or below so it's something I can live with.Very pleased with this camera overall and consider it to be a steal for all that you get with it - especially with the 12x zoom.

With only two batteries at a time, I got around 300 shots on one set of batteries, and easily stuffed two additional pairs in my camera bag or purse at any given time.Photo quality: after a week in the caribbean, I've been able to compare the photos produced by my SX130IS,  My sister-in-laws SX20IS (the prior modes of the SX30IS), and my husband's uber-DSL (Nikon D90).... and I am very pleasantly surprised to tell you that my photos definitely show nicely in this comparison.Portability:  While larger than the little rectangle pocket cameras, the size of the 130S is still a nice small portable size--much easier to tote around than the larger SX20/30IS.Features/Settings/software:  While my previous camera had an auto mode, I used it only rarely, usually preferring to select the modes myself.  But the \"auto-detect\" mode on this camera takes the auto setting to a new level, auto-detecting which mode it should be, and giving good information about what that is, for making photo-taking as quick as possible when I just didn't have time to futz with it.  As I was often trailing 2 toddlers, this was a really nice feature, that came in very handy, and worked surprisingly well.I did a quick read of the quick-start manual before we left on the trip, and from there, I found the controls intuitive and easy to follow.Video: I took lots of short videos of the kids being kids.  I am thrilled at how well the zoom-while-filming works--past cameras has trouble keeping the focus caught up, but this camera performed brilliantly in that aspect.  I posted one of the HD videos online for my in-laws, and my gadgethead/amateur videographer Father-in-law thought it came from my husband's high-end HD video camera.The bad:Someone else mentioned a speck of dust getting inside and settling on the lens.  I'm sad to report I ran into this also.  If I look closely as some of my photos, I do see a slight blur in that location--but I have to magnify and look closely for it. Like the other reviewer's experience, my speck fell back off the lens after a day or so.  I'll be keeping an eye out to see if it comes back -- if it becomes a recurring problem, my opinion of the camera will drop drastically.The lens cap: is one of the self-retracting caps. It's spring loaded, so just throwing the camera un-protected in a smaller purse is a bad idea -- the cover could get pushed to the side and allow dust or scratches on your lens.  You definitely need some kind of protective camera case, even if just one of the small built-to fit ones.  (I have a small shoulder-strap camera bag that easily fits this camera in the main cushioned compartment, with pockets for a couple spare memory cards, a handful of batteries, and even a couple credit cards and cash, so I can just drag it out instead of a purse.)Viewfinder:  I like having an oldschool viewfinder to save battery, and because it helps me focus my mind on the subject and framing.  This camera sadly doesn't have one -- only the LCD screen.  But the screen is large, vivid, and easy to use.  And battery life really hasn't been a problemOverall, I'm very pleased with this camera so far.

The camera performs well for basic still photography, our main purpose for it. It is packed with many useful features and with a short learning curve are easy to find and to use. Pictures are sharp, however the image stabilization is not as effective as we thought it would be, so use a tripod especially when zooming out or in low light situations. The camera is comfortable to use and the ability to use AA batteries is a big plus. And, thus far we have gotten very long life on lithium and particularly on nihds. The LCD size is great, it is very bright and clear and we have had no problem using it in bright sunlight situations. The built in flash is a little harsh but the camera allows you to weaken the flash settings and that worked well for us. The big complaint, and big enough so that we cancelled plans to buy Canon's EOS 60D DSLR, is that it's color reproduction is poor. We have taken pictures of color wheels and other photograghic color images that are designed to test a camera's color reproduction ability. And the comparison is not good. Our understanding is that the EOS line uses the same or similar color sensor devices as the 130IS. Colors are somewhat washed out and some colors, purples and violet hues in particular, come out as bright blue. Not even close to the actual color. We have tried many different settings from varying ISO, white balance, contrast settings etc., but to no effect on the resulting color reproduction. Since my wife uses the camera to capture images that she wants to paint, water color and oils, this becomes a big negative. This is the reason for the 3 rating.I don't know how competitor cameras fare in this department so before you purchase make sure you check out the color reproduction capability of the 130's competitors.The camera's startup time and focusing time are good and if not for the color reproduction I would heartily recommend the camera, especially from a cost perspective.

This camera is a huge improvement over my previous point & shoots. It's light weight & works as well as the bigger cameras I've used in the past.  The 12.1mp and 12x's optical zoom are incredible.  My photo's have improved in quality 10 x's what I expected.  I even entered one shot in a photo contest.  I'm thrilled with it's ability to focus when I let it.  I tend to get excited & shoot without properly focusing, but even the majority of those have come out better than I hoped.  It has allowed me to capture some really good shots of my grand kids who can be a constantly moving target. Shooting a still images is even better than kids, just not as entertaining sometimes.  Using a 1 to 10 rating scale...I rate my abilities at 7 and the camera at 10+. I'm thoroughly enjoying the learning curve.

It's expensive looking, giving off an aura of prestige and power (like driving an Audi A8). When you point this Baby at somebody, you look like a serious photog [:-)Yeah, it's a little bulkier than a lot of other P&S; cameras, but it'll fit in your shirt pocket, and I find the larger body easier to hold. All the controls seem ergonomically perfect for my hands, the big 3\" LCD helps me quickly focus on my subject, and the 12X zoom is amazing. It powers on and is ready to shoot fast enough for my amateur photo needs, which are typical family/home subjects as well as product photos for eBay and Craigslist. Because my other camera is a PowerShot A560, I'm familiar with Canon's menus and was taking photos right away without having to learn a new camera's idiosyncrasies.I know this review is not very technical, but I wanted to let everyone know that for less than $200, this is one powerhouse camera that you'll probably like a lot too.Unlike Free's ridiculous review below, more intelligent reviewers have pointed out some important considerations about using this camera:1) Ever heard the acronym RTFM? It's too vulgar to spell out, but it can't be repeated often enough. Probably 80% of the problems people whine about in their 1 and 2 star reviews could have been resolved by RTFM.2) Forget about using regular alkalines in this camera... buy AA NiMH rechargeables and a charger. For my A560, I bought Powerex batteries and their MH-C204F charger, which processes 2 or 4 batteries at a time. There's a newer model of the 204F--the 204W--or you can buy the more functional MH-C801D that charges 1 to 8 batteries at a time. Check out the Amazon reviews of these products for more information. Ansmann and Eneloop batteries also get good reviews.3) The SX130 will function much faster with a class 10 memory card. I bought SanDisk for my A560, and it's functioned flawlessly for 3 years. For my SX130, I bought a SanDisk Extreme Class 10 card. Check out the Amazon reviews and you'll see that the class 10 cards are a much better choice for a digital camera. Note that cards in the \"bulk\" package cost less because you're not paying for the retail box with all the plastic packaging.I plan to update this review in the future if I experience any problems you should be aware of.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "First one wa a lemon; now on my second and love it", "Author": "Sharon Yildiz", "ReviewID": "R2QTLFE4G3BHHE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did a couple months' research on this before ordering it and an accessories pack on Amazon from Cameta Camera.  I started with an SLR, but have been using a digital point-and-shoot since 2006 (Panasonic Lumix brand).  I travel a lot and take about 3000-5000 photos a year.  I should note here that I \"baby\" my cameras and have never had one malfunction... until my first SX130.The first SX130 I was sent turned out to be a complete lemon and was totally dead within 9 days.  After the first 50 shots, it lost its ability to ever focus again once I had used the zoom.  It would grind and grind, trying to find focus... then would stop exactly when nothing at all was in focus.  It couldn't even find focus if I retracted the zoom entirely.  So using the zoom was out of the question.  Within a few more days, the auto-lens-cap broke.  A piece of the plastic dangled limply at all times, blocking the lens.  I finally tried zooming to \"clear\" it, but the zoom got stuck and couldn't retract.  At that point, the camera started giving error messages and nothing would move.  I tried new batteries, pushed all sorts of button combos... but the zoom never again retracted. I had to mail it back to Cameta with the zoom lens fully out.Cameta originally refused to replace it, as I hadn't sent them the box.  But they did eventually send a new one. I've now had that the replacement SX 130 for four days, and it is so far working great.  I printed the 180 page manual and am going through step by step trying the features.  I'm in love with all the features, and this is really the camera of my dreams...if it keeps working.  I'm so gun shy now, I expect the thing to fall apart in my hands at any moment.Here are the pros so far:  great picture quality, good flash power, easy to use, great manual, and lots of fun things like the smile detector and wink self timer.Cons:  TERRIBLE battery life.  No exaggeration to say that I've had to replace the NiCad AA's after every ten minutes of use.  When going through the manual, I had to turn the camera on and off, trying new features as I came to them.  I was having to replace the batteries after every 20 or so photos.  Compare this to my Lumix, that takes 700 high-quality still photos on a single battery charge, and one charge lasts through three days of international sight-seeing and constant picture taking.  I've just gone out and got 8 NiCad AA's for the SX130, but this isn't even going to be enough power to photograph a dinner party much less a day long sightseeing tour.  It also has slow recovery after flashing, but I don't mind this as the flash is much better than the one on my Lumix.  Finally, I find it harder to grip than the Lumix, though that's a very minor complaint.  But I do make sure to always put the wrist strap on before I take the camera out of the case.I would give my original SX130 ZERO stars.  For features, I'd give the new one FIVE stars (pending its continued good operation) other than the battery life, which is again ZERO stars.

I still have my A20 and now use it for underwater shots, inside the very sturdy Canon waterproof case.  I have owned the A20, the SX110IS, and the SX10IS.  Many of our family members have powershots, including the SX20IS and the older A40.  We have all been very pleased with our Canon cameras.  One of my favorite features of the powershots I've bought has been the fact that they use AA batteries.  Yes, it means shorter battery life, but it also means never being unable to use the camera on a trip away from home -- all you have to do is buy AA batteries at a gas station and you're good to go.  Well worth it to me to give up some battery life for that convenience.I have been very happy with my SX110IS - beautiful still shots, good movies, travels well.  It has some annoying features like very slow flash cycling, but overall it's been a great camera.Well, I gave my SX110IS to a family member as a gift, planning to buy myself this SX130IS as a replacement.  I assumed I'd get the same great camera, but now with HD video and a few extra megapixels as a bonus.I am **VERY** disappointed in the SX130IS.  There's something not quite as good about the still shots, but that's not my primary complaint.  My main complaint is the video mode.  It is absolutely awful.  Constantly goes in and out of focus while filming.  I noticed this immediately on using the camera, so I returned it to Amazon as an exchange for the exact same model, figuring it was just a flaw with that one camera.  Not so.  The replacement has the exact same problem.  I've gone through all the possible settings, and the problem persists.  The only thing that helps is to use manual focus, but then you have to, well, focus manually, which isn't always an option for real-world filming, and is not easy to do with this camera.  I even shot the same scene with this camera and then with my SX10IS for comparison, and the older SX10IS shot perfect video, while this new camera blurred in and out of focus the whole time.  I've sent back the second camera, this time for a refund.  I have no intention of trying again with this model, especially now that I've noted several other reviewers here and on other sites complaining about the same problem.

For stills there is absolutely no comparison and the reason is color. I took the same shots around my house with this Canon that I previously took with Polaroid (I know), Fuji, Panasonic, Kodak and Sony cams and they all seemed washed out and dull by comparison.Resolution is great. I had no problems with shifty autofocus or camera shake (though I tend to use a tripod when possible). The menu is easy to navigate and the cam is overall very user friendly. So far I haven't even cracked the manual CD - even the custom timers were easy to figure out (an incredibly handy feature that no other cam I read about or used had, but a feature I ). I took a few hundred shots with auto setting and every one was clear, focused, and detailed. And did I mention the color? =WOW!One of the big reasons I was searching for a new cam was to get HD video and this is where the news gets a bit worse, not just for this cam it turns out but for all of them. Somehow I was unaware that there is a file system problem that prevents many cams (INCUDING THIS CANON) from recording HD video clips longer than about 10 minutes (there was also some nonsense about a 5 minute video limit on cams sold in Europe due to import restrictions or some such). I verified this with several SD cards (class 4 and 6) and at 9:59 the cam shuts down (actually powers itself off). Some chat on the net implied that this was as much to prevent overheating as to comply with the FAT32 file structure and I CAN BELIEVE IT, because after 10 minutes of video this cam is REALLY HOT to the touch on the right side!I was able to restart the cam and take additional video clips without incident but after 3 or 4 clips the heat issue concerned me enough to stop recording for a while and let the Canon cool its heels. The quality of these clips was nothing short of A - mazing however. I had almost given up believing that any cam could actually record even decent video for less than $500, but with a tripod and in daytime outside it gives you some absolutely stunning footage (for ten minutes). All the other new cams I bought and tried had video really no better than my 3 year old Fujis 640 x 480 standard def capture, even though they were all supposed to be HD and were set to record in either 720 or 1080. Still, aside from the image being widescreen, actual video on my 42\" plasma was disspaointing to say the least. The Canon is a whole other level of video quality than these other brands.After much research it became obvious that optical quality and familiarity with the photographic process was perhaps even more important than techical specs (which increasingly cannot really be trusted) when shopping for cams. For this reason I eventually limited my search to Canon and Nikon products and though I really did like the looks and feel of the Nikon L110 I am convinced that there is no way the Nikon could give any better performance for the money than this Canon. Also the Canon, while not small, still would be far easier to pocket than the larger Nikon and there is something to be said for portability. The Canon IS a battery vampire for sure so I recommend a few sets of AA Enerloops, also at least a class 4 (6 or 10 even better) SD card for HD video without stutter (for 10 minutes).Still, I am happy with the Canon despite its limitations. I guess I will have to save up for a Sanyo FH1a or some such animal to record longer vids. A bummer to be sure, but dont let that stop you from buying this Canon. I really believe it is as good as it gets with point and shoots for 2010!#### UPDATE -- Oct 12, 2010  -- UPDATE #####OK, I have decided that the 10 minute time limit on video is, for me, a dealbreaker. So I have returned the SX130is and am now eagerly eyeing a release date for the Nikon S8100, which I believe CAN record HD video for the limit of the memory card.

I had read the reviews and everyone seemed to be happy with the camera (with the exception of using AA batteries, which didn't bother me).  I could not be less satisfied.First of all, only about 2 of every 10 pictures came out clear and focused.  This was using auto mode and, yes, holding the button halfway to allow the camera to focus).  Every other shot looked like I wasn't even trying to hold the camera still.Secondly, the lag time between shots was horribly slow.  After a shot, I waited 9 seconds to be able to take the next one (I missed many good shots at a recent wedding because of this).  I'm using the correct speed/type of SD card and I've already tried the low-level format the manual suggests.Last thing: the battery life is quite poor.  I'm using the recommended eneloop batteries and I've already recharged and replaced about 4 times in the last month (maybe 100-150 shots total?)I'm by no means \"technologically challenged\", and I'm hoping I just got a faulty camera, but I was not happy with this purchase.

It seems like it is programmed to make the pictures too bright though.  More times than not, normal light conditions would be slightly washed out.  It wasn't terrible, but noticeable.I don't care for the menus on newer canon cameras, they seem dumbed down too much to me.The videos do a great job for a camera, I was very pleased with it.I often had issues with this camera using up the batteries quickly, and often without warning.  The indication that the batteries are low come up way too late, often when it can only take a few more pictures.  Then, when testing the batteries after the sx130 will not turn on, they often would have enough juice left for other electronics to use them for many hours more.  If you get this camera, make sure you have spare batteries at all times, it is often a surprise when it needs new ones.I would have given the camera a 4 star rating based on the above, but couldn't primarily because of the flash.  First, I find it amazing that the flash does not raise or come on automatically.  I can't count how many pictures I've missed because I forgot to flip the flash up.  Isn't this 2010 canon?  There is a reminder on the screen, but it is brief, and often you are not reading the screen, but rather looking at the picture instead: especially when trying to take a quick shot of the kids.The other part I couldn't get past is the wait time to take another picture after using the flash.  I have an 8 year old digital canon that charges the flash several times faster than the the sx130is does.  I tried a number of different types and brands of AA batteries, and although some were better than others, none of them were acceptable.

Belt loop looks a little iffy, but a toy-quality carabiner as a back-up gives me peace of mind.Liked the 150 so well that I ordered the slightly less featured 130 a couple of days after buying the 150. I'd have gone with the 120, but the price on 130 was better. Any of these cameras should work well.Controls are \"intuitive\" if you have had a few digital cameras. Pics look great for the documentation and illustration that I do. All the features and gee-wiz may be fantastic for all I know. Do you need a self-timer that starts when you enter the picture and blink your eyes? I don't think I do, but you might.Easy access to manual control is great when images must match in exposure for after-the-fact editing. There's also a variety of white balance possibilities. No raw output tho. Turn off the image review or you spend your time waiting in between pics.Larger size,greater weight, and image stabilization make it easier to hand hold especially in lower light. And image stabilization really works well. This camera could better use strap lugs, rings, and a shoulder strap instead of a wrist strap. Ring type selector around the function set button beats hell out of a slew of tiny buttons and lots of tabbed sub menus. - A little too easy to bump things tho while intending to change one setting and accidentally changing another.Experiments moving from sensitivity of 80 or 100 have been mixed. I'm not impressed. With most digitals and oh so long ago with film I have found that higher sensitivity is a trade-off with noise.This camera uses batteries. Take a bunch of the highest capacity NiMH AA that you can get your hands on. Make sure they are in good shape and fully charged! I'm getting 100 to 150 shots out of each pair of new 2300s before getting a low battery warning.

So I really needed something that would meet my needs and dependable.I had read reviews about the batteries not lasting very long but I have found that is not the case.  I wanted a camera with AA batteries and that was another good feature of this camera.  AA batteries are reasonable in price and can be found in a variety of stores so it's not a problem to carry extras.  I have taken a lot of pics and I still have the original AA batteries in my camera.A nice feature that was not in the description is the flash.

It's fast to learn, it has easy to understand pre-sets, a friendly menu and a very clear display.  In low light, the pictures are slightly grainy without the flash, but it takes them quickly enough on auto-mode to avoid the motion-blur that always plagued low-light pictures with our old camera, which is good enough at least for candid snap-shots so long as you aren't looking to sell them.The color seems pretty accurate, too.  Our older camera struggled particularly with shades of purple for some reason, while this one seems to have no such problems.  Every picture seems to come out well colored, and if it's in good light or with the flash, it's crisp and clear too.Its Achilles heels (one per foot for twice the legend) are its erratic shot-to-shot time, and its enthusiastic devouring of batteries.Sometimes, you'll take a shot, and the next shot will be available quickly.  But other times, you'll snap a picture and then find yourself waiting, the camera's screen black and empty while it prepares to let you take another.  The time between shots can be frustrating on occasion, especially if you're using the flash, and if you're looking to be able to take a lot of shots quickly then this definitely isn't the camera for you.  Our oldest digicam, a Nikon Coolpix 3100, was noticeably faster shot-to-shot than any camera we've owned since even when using flash, and that probably spoiled us.  But even so, this one seems particularly slow.Its other issue is batteries.  If you use regular alkalines, this camera will quickly eat them, and you'll find yourself queueing up to buy more.  The up side is that it uses regular batteries, so you can simply use chargeable NiMH or Eneloops, and carry extras with you; and it chews its way through those batteries much more slowly.  It'll still eat them, though, as it only uses two -- a trade-off that gives you slightly reduced battery life in exchange for a lighter, less unwieldy body than a camera that uses four.  Personally I'd happily take the reduced battery life and carry a few spares in my pocket to deal with it.Overall, though, I like this camera.  It's not everything I'd want in a camera, but in the price range I could afford, I was never going to get that.

I was almost as upset as i would be at the passing of a dear friend. I loved that camera.The results from this camera are as good as from the 650, at least so far. I grant you I haven't had it very long, but I've run all the tests and it has passed with flying colors. I have heard that it's a real pig with batteries, so I've invested in top quality eneloops and will be sure to carry extras with me whenever I am going to be shooting. I've always carried lots of spare batteries anyhow as a matter of principle.Some people hate the fact that the camera uses AAs. Personally, I love knowing I can get batteries anywhere and am not tethered to being somewhere where I can recharge a proprietary battery. It's a personal matter.I do not do much video shooting, so I was really unable to rate the video quality. Every once in a blue moon a shoot a little video, but so rarely that it's not a matter of concern for me. You'll have to read other reviewers for that information. I really don't know. As a still camera, the pictures are sharp, it focuses quickly and accurately and the flash shots are surprisingly good. I don't like flash, so I am predisposed to not like the results ... I was surprised at the high quality from this little camera. I much prefer the pop up flash to a built in one ... if you don't want flash, you don't have to mess with settings. Just don't pop it up and it won't fire.It isn't a DSLR. I wish I could afford one, but right now, I can't. When I finally get the money together, I will happily move on, but a camera like this is always a useful sidekick, even when you have a full DSLR rig. There are plenty of times when you don't want to haul the big gun.I have read complaints that the viewfinder is fuzzy. I do not find it so. Do I miss having one that flips out? No, actually, I don't. I know it's supposed to be better, but I like this better and always found having to look to the side to see the picture awkward. Do I wish it had a viewfinder? Honestly? Not really. As an eyeglass wearer, I've always found it hard to really see well through a viewfinder. If I had it, I would probably use it occasionally, but I don't miss it. If it's a big deal for you, well, this camera doesn't have one. Other Canon models do.This is my third Canon during that last decade. I have loved them all. The first one is still alive and well and my son loves it. Before that, I was using an SLR and actual film and working professionally. Considering that I used to be a pro back in the day, I am remarkably satisfied with this camera, as I was by its predecessors. Canon makes a fine product.A Note: 6 months later:It's STILL  great little camera. Using the high end rechargeable AAs (Sanyo Enyloops), I get a very good battery life. Of course I carry spares too. I love knowing I can get extra batteries anywhere pretty much.It dependably and without compaint takes excellent pictures. It isn't the fastest P&S.; It doesn't have the longest lens. It isn't the most compact nor does it have the most bells and whistles. However: it has everything I really need in a point & shoot camera. If I want more, I'll use one of my interchangeable lens cameras ... one of the 4/3 Olympus most likely. I don't do much video so it remains a non-issue for me. I also don't shoot much using flash, although when I have, this camera works just fine.For the price, it has an excellent feature set. The full override was critical to me: everything else was optional. It's big enough so I can see the screen without squinting, small enough to drop into my purse and go, no special bag needed. It isn't my primary camera and wasn't intended to be, but it is a fantastic back-up camera and I love knowing that if I'm not in a position to recharge a proprietary battery, I can pick up replacement batteries anywhere. In my opinion, everyone who shoots a lot should have ONE camera that works on AAs ... just in case.You can spend more and if it is going to be your primary camera, you may want some features it doesn't have.

I realize this model only carries 2 batteries but overall I would say you'll spend about twice as much  than with older ones, for example, just try zooming while shooting video and no matter how new the batteries are, you'll likely get a \"low battery\" warning (I'm not kidding).But what really has me down about this new camera are the colors which are mediocre at best.

So went to a shop before I purchased to know its size. It holds in a pocket if ur pocket is big enough (most of the men's casual trousers). Not small nor big, it is of medium size. So to me it didn't matter much with the size. Pretty good on size for me. And batteries I got Sanyo eneloop, so it does good with these batteries as they don't die out soon. Also the discharge rate is too slow. So I don't have to bother about recharging them after many days. If ur camera is out of batteries u can get AA batteries from most of the stores near by. So not in danger of running out of batteries. But it is the biggest negative for this camera as usual batteries die out fast. Regarding flash, after I read out the reviews that I need to pop up the flash when I take the photos, when I took the first few shots I missed it. All the photos would have been great if I had popped up the flash. But over time I will definitely pop up the flash when needed. But the image quality is good when u use flash. Next time if I forget I can check from the preview that it is not the best shot, then \"POP up the FLASH\" should come out of my brain. So let's see how it works. There are some nice features like manual focus, accent mode, fish eye, miniature effect, vivid colors, etc. Also u can increase the power of flash if u r not satisfied. Video is too good, but the file size of the video is huge. You can zoom in the video mode and the quality is still as good as it is without zoom.For me it is one of the best cameras in its range. Also if you use all the features and the manual controls then this one is good. If you want to use it in auto mode or for sports action or u want a quick snap then this is not good for you. Still this camera lacks powerful image stabilization. My old old Olympus did too good on Image stabilization. It freezes the motion and never got a blurred shot with it.

But, I took everything out, dried it out as best I could and let it sit for a while. It still works after all of that. Of course, it is a smidge slower, but overall, it works the same as it did before. Gotta say I'm impressed and surprised about that.There is also a video section as well, but I wasn't all that impressed with it. It does do pretty good with video, just like the pictures, but the sound is horrible. I tried to record something at Luray Caverns, but I couldn't hear a thing from it later on. Also, there's a ten minute limit as well. I didn't know that but would have liked to know as I did try to record things that were longer than 10 minutes. Overall, though, it's not bad. I don't use video too much anyways.I've seen some reviews mentioning dust and dirt, but I haven't had that problem as of yet. I clean the screen as best I can and keep it in a case when I'm not using it.I've also seen some reviews mentioning that it takes horrible pictures, but that's not the case. It does take amazing pictures. But the thing is, it's also depends on the person using it. My sister can't take as good of pictures as I can, so all of hers don't turn out as well. If someone can't take pictures, it doesn't matter if you spend $5 or $5000 on a camera, you're not going to be able to take good pictures. Having a good camera helps, but it's also the person taking the pictures. My uncle, who has been a  professional photographer for over 30 years, agrees that this camera is a good camera.I've taken tons of pictures with this camera. Some even while moving in cars and planes - some of them didn't turn out as well as hoped for. I've taken pictures of weather, clouds, flowers, people and so on. I've taken pictures in different types of weather as well - from sunny warm weather, to rainy weather, to snowy weather, even in the middle of a hurricane. There camera hasn't had a problem in any temperature. Though, it did get a bit steamy during the hurricane and covered with too much rain, but that's to be expected.Overall, I love this camera and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent camera with a lower price tag.

If I use flash, which I don't like to, I know it would be better. daytime shooting, this thing performs perfectly. Macro is amazing, the lens almost touches the subject and can still focus! For the cost this can't be beat. if you are saying this camera is too big, this was not a camera for your demographic to begin with so look elsewhere. If you are a dSLR shooter looking for control over your exposure, seriosuly consider trying this or their SX150IS out!I saw this on sale at Target for $99 since they were trying to push the SX150IS and phase out the SX130IS. A few years ago I had the SX110IS which I absolutely loved but sold it because of how quick it drains the AA batteries, since then Sanyo has released their Eneloop Lithium batteries and I have a bunch of them for my gadgets so battery was no longer an issues. REMEMBER if you want to be happy with this camera get ENELOOPS!I'm a dSLR shooter but wanted a P&S; with a longer lens reach than your usual small camera. I have an iPhone 4S and that camera is already pretty amazing, but the lack of optical zoom makes it useless at times. Also because I like to have the OPTION of manual control this camera was perfect...so I thought.Originally I had gotten the Nikon S9100 at Target, they had it for sale for $199. I LOVED this camera except there were two issues I was unable to live with, 1- I think there was an issue with the dial, a few time I turned it to auto mode, but the camera would be in scene mode, it would take a few more back and forth rotation before it actually would get to the auto mode. 2- there may have been a speck of dust on the sensor because when I zoom in, you would see a blurred area that would not move when you move the camera. the s9100 has a backside illuminated CMOS sensor which was AWESOME in low light, there was never shutter lag, not even in a dim room, you press the shutter and it takes a picture right away. Sadly reading the reviews showed that it had many issues.Seeing that I had great experience with the old SX110IS I thought this camera would also rock now that it's three years later. the SX130IS performed horribly in dim light, most of my pictures were blurred when I used AUTO. The AUTO mode doesn't seem to be very smart, because it would use a higher ISO...which would be fine, but this sensor produces way too much noise even at ISO400. The smart thing would be to use a lower ISO, larger aperture and slow the shutter speed. if I take a picture in AUTO and then take a picture with manual, manual will take a better picture. I would like Canon to make the AUTO mode calculate better. but THIS is why I got this camera, I have 100% control of the picture since I understand photography, but I shouldn't have to, it should be capable to doing just fine in AUTO.I am going to attach TWO pictures I took with the camer in a very dark setting, the better one would be using MANUAL ,no flash, I set up (10 seconds shutter, f/3.4, ISO 200), the dark one will be AUTO with no flash (shutter was 1/8, f/3.4, ISO800) I have no idea why the Auto setting would want to to do this since the picture would be useless! If you get this camera, you have to realize that you can make better judgement on the exposure!HERE ARE A FEW MORE SHORT ISSUE I HAVE:Video Mode - it caps out at 10 minutes. WTH?!?!Selector Wheel -  too stiff (unlike the old SX110IS which was perfect) I find myself pushing down instead of rotating itUSB/AV port door - STOP making these things so hard to pull open. I'm a clean neat person, I don't usually have nails that long. this is not a weather proof camera stop making me look for tools to open this!Zoom - thanks for letting us zoom while in movie mode. I understand you want the mic to not pick up the zoom noise when recording video, but you need to have a option of letting it zoom faster. you've slowed it down way too much when recording videoVideo - I don't like the fact that there's no dedicated record video button on this version, it's on the dial...this was changed in the SX150ISLCD - way too low res for this day and ago. the pictures don't look that good on this LCD, the Nikon S9100 is BEAUTIFUL.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "100% Happy", "Author": "Travis D", "ReviewID": "R2WGXTA16WR45S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for $90 on sale.

I considered other brands for my next camera before settling on this one because once again Canon offered everything I want. I'm not anywhere near a professional photographer, but I want something more than just point and shoot and this is a good hybrid. It has Easy and Automatic modes but also lets you make some adjustments if you're gutsy enough (which I'm usually not).I like this model because it has 12x zoom, and I also love the video capabilities. I bought it because I needed it to shoot a video the very next day, and I was up and running with no learning curve even though it differs from my old model. I was extremely pleased with the quality of the video too. I haven't tried it in low light yet; that was a weakness of my old Canon so I'm expecting some improvements there. But I mainly shoot during the day or inside with lights on so that wasn't enough of a detriment to push me to a different model.This camera does have its drawbacks, but they're about the same as my old Canon. Chief among them is that it's a terrible battery eater, so I always bring many, many spares. It also has a somewhat slow reset speed, but part of that is due to a setting that can be changed, as well as the type of SD card you use. None of those things are show stoppers for me, given this camera's other advantages.

I like the heft in my hands when taking pictures.-Fit and finish are good, with one minor caveat for the battery compartment. (See Cons, below.)-The LCD (viewing screen) is large, and very bright. You can actually see the image out-of-doors, in the shade. Brightness is adjustable- I have it racked-up all the way.-Focusing range is remarkable, from about \u00bd inch to infinity.-Crucially, normal indoor & outdoor photos are quite good- contrast and saturation are adjustable, and sharpness is very good for a point-and-shoot camera.-12.1 megapixels is a big image, which permits cropping and selecting areas of photos, without ending up with a small \"thumbnail\" snapshot.-The price for all of these features and capabilities is great- I paid $198 from Amazon; reduced by $20 a few days later!Cons-A printed owner's manual does not come with the camera. If you want one to carry out with your new camera, print it yourself, 180 pages, from the PDF file on the CD that comes in the box, or download it from the internet. This irks me.-The many reviewer complaints about battery life are justified, though it should be clear that a camera with all these bells and whistles, that uses off-the-shelf AA batteries is just going to be hard on batteries.  Don't even think about using alkaline batteries in this camera, unless you plan to carry a pocketful when you go out. Though not specifically recommended in the owner's manual, I use lithium batteries. Pricey, but I get 200 - 300 photos from a pair. Battery life depends on how often the camera is powered up and down, and mainly, on how often the flash is fired.-One thing that bothers me a little is the battery and SD card compartment. It's under a lot of spring tension, does not move real smoothly; makes me a little nervous- I'd hate to break it.-The flash has to be manually popped-up for use. Like me, you will forget, miss the on-screen prompt, and miss some shots. Cannon designers surely have their reasons, but still, this seems unnecessary- I have a smaller, older Canon with the flash fixed firmly in position for use any time.-With very close-up flash shots the lens barrel shadow gets in the picture, visible as a dark, circular area, which ruins the photo.  Back off a bit to permit the flash to clear the lens shadow.-Sharpness of extreme telephoto shots is soft, though as good as I expect from a point-and-shoot camera in this price range.Other Thoughts and Conclusions-I strongly recommend purchasing a case with any camera. Just laying it around, much less carrying it in the woods- will eventually scratch and pit the camera and the LCD.-Another recommendation is: read the manual. The manual will tell you how to use it, how to deal with problems, and how to use its many, many features. Some of the controls, such as the \"control dial\" and the \"zoom lever,\" require a delicate touch and a bit of practice. Spend some time sitting around, exploring the camera with the manual. Then, when a bald eagle lands on your bird feeder, you will be ready!-I would like to be able to save images in formats other than JPG, such as TIFF or RAW.-I am a plant photographer; I purchased this camera as a \"companion\" for my big SLR, to shoot habitats and mid-range pictures.

Before purchasing the camera, I saw handful of reviews complaining about this camera draining batteries, but I honestly have no idea what they are talking about.  I wasn't counting, but the cheap AA batteries the camera came with probably gave me a 100 to 200 shots.  Some taken with flash.  Out of the four digital cameras I've owned, this in fact has been the most energy-efficient camera I've owned.  After using up the cheapie AA batteries, I now use the rechargeables, and they've been working out just perfectly.Picture/Close-up's - I am a horrid photographer.  With the Nikon Coolpix L12, I think I was pretty much the worst photographer in the world.  Nikon was bullet-proof however, and it is still 100% functional.  But the reason I started shopping for new camera was the close shots.  I tried take pictures for eBay, or of diecast cars, and Nikon Coolpix L12, like many other cameras were not equipped to take close-up shots.  Pictures all ended up being blurry, out of focus.  This Canon however, there has been times that I'm so close to the object, the lens accidentally tap what I'm trying to take a picture of.  You can get almost that close, and it still takes a detailed photo completely in focus.  This ability makes this Canon my favorite camera.I waited until I owned this camera for little bit before writing this review.  This is because I was bit worried about the latching design on the battery cover/door.  I did not like the way it released/unlatched/opened, and I was somewhat skeptical of its' durability.  I'm happy to report that battery cover, along with everything else has been rock-solid on this camera.  I've never owned a Canon before this, but I would not hesitate recommending one after my experience with this camera.I was originally going to give it four stars, because the pictures I take does not exactly come out professional quality, but thinking about it a bit more, that's more of the problem with the operator.  Pictures do come out pretty good, which means the camera is compensating a lot for lack of photography skills, or even basic knowledge on my part.  PowerShot SX130IS gets five stars from me.

This low-light setting allows you to capture natural-light photos indoors and out with fair to excellent clarity, in situations where you don't want to use the flash, or can't. Fantastic camera - there's a reason that this camera still retails for nearly the original retail price, while the newer models are $20-50 cheaper. I had to order this camera THREE TIMES, because the first two orders, they shipped me the newer model, even though they said on order they had the 130 in stock. I sent them back - they are NOT equivalent. No one can believe the great quality shots I get with this. NOTE: I recommend doing test shots with the \"portrait\" (\"head\" icon), landscape, and auto settings, as i find the Portrait setting is often the best speed and clarity for most shots, better than the Auto setting in many cases, and the Landscape (\"mountain\" icon) setting is great not only for actual landscapes, but when you are capturing pictures out of a moving train/plane/car to get a clear distance shot and avoid having only the window in focus! The \"parrot\" icon - color saturation - often gives a more realistic sunset color rendering than other settings, and the low-light setting (\"candle\" icon) not only does a good job in low light, it's also perfect for shots where you want a quick shutter speed but don't want to go manual, even in good light. Finally, manual controls are there for when you want to really get creative, and there are fun settings like \"posterize\", \"miniaturize\", and others.Please Canon - bring back the 130 tech specs in the newer versions...

I used this camera on a 5 month personal trip through SE Asia and got tons of great photos--I love the zoom. I wanted to comment on battery life, since that is a common thread in these reviews. You *must* use high-quality rechargeables, though I have to say, traveling through many different countries, it was critical that I have a camera that took commonly available batteries. The few times I was caught (through my own lack of foresight) without a charged battery I was always able to find AA batteries, even in the most remote village,  which got me through the day until I could charge my rechargeables. I always made sure I had a backup pair with me and never had a problem unless I forgot them, usually getting through 1-3 days of non-stop photos. I got a small travel-sized recharger in Vietnam that worked great. I'm a travel writer and photos are essential so I also took a smaller Canon point-and-shoot that I could have in my smallest purse, which was also my backup camera, and it was so convenient that they both took AAs. I was hesitant about the whole AA battery story at first, but I'll never go back due to the convenience and availability factor.I also wanted to say that Canon provides excellent customer service. They replaced my camera without any questions when I sent it in for service while it was under warranty.

I'm an Avid Camera Fan....prior to a break in of my car I had a 20D and two 40Ds and one of the 70-200 IS 2.8 L Series Lenses...I now have a 50D with the standard lens.  I'm pretty serious about my camera addiction...and after the break in also had to replace a point and shoot.First off I didnt really get a chance to read the reviews on this camera before purchasing...I had about an hour to run into Best Buy, buy a camera, and head to Seaworld.  Wanted something with a relativley inexpensive Dive Case (the 50Ds is right costly), and I wanted something relativley inexpensive.I saw this camera, saw it had a case, saw the pretty nifty price, the functions, and the HD Video and was sold at that point.  Two hours later it was with me at SeaWorld SA.I got an opportunity to play around with the functions alot and was very happy.  Did the general 'P' setting for the first set of pictures in the direct sunlight.  The image quality was great and I was able to capture some pretty amazing pictures of some Sea Lions doing some tricks.  The color settings were quite nice also.  Played around in the shade a little bit and changed to shutter mode to catch the dolphins and shamoo going up...and I got some pretty serious, nice quality images out of those.  It darkened everything (duh) but the picture quality, the color and the sharpess were still very good and the amount of noise in the background was minimal.The zoom on this camera was also a big plus for me.  My last PS was an olympus 15ft waterproof camera that I bought for the pool...but now that I am diving I wanted something with a touch more oomph..and that camera had no zoom.  The quality and response of the zoom on this one was nice.  It also picked up the images pretty quickly for the auto focus.I'll have to go into how the camera does under water once I purchase the case...but until then I am right happy with the surface shooting I have gotten out of it so far.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "best camera i have owned yet", "Author": "Gina Tell \"Gina Tell\"", "ReviewID": "R3UK80NGPV860F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my birthday and have taken pictures of EVERYTHING in site.

I remember all the complainers in the reviews I read before I bought this, who talked about it eating batteries.  Well, just go and get a Duracell 6 hour charger with the 4 Ni-mh batteries included for about 18 bucks. The camera uses 2 at a time and you have spares when you need them.

The quality of the high res photos is excellent.  As a longtime photo buff that used a Canon A1 for 25 years, this camera will do almost everything that SLR would do and a bunch of stuff it did not do.  It is easy to use and combines the ability to use automatic features as well as a complete manual mode.Now for the stuff that keeps it from being 5 stars.  It eats batteries.  Forget about using alkaline batteries and go with rechargeables.  The mfg estimates of number of pictures or amount of video is pretty meaningless.  You will get about an hour of shooting time, depending on how much you use the zoom and flash.  I did some testing and with continuous recording I got about 55 minutes of video...no zooming and very little review.  I was able to shoot about 30 minutes of video and 400 pictures using some zoom and flash but it was all done in less than an hour of shoot time.  When I say shoot time, I mean the actual time the camera is on.  Not elapsed time, but, constantly turning on and off the camera does cost battery life as well.Next, manual focus does not work all that well.  Using the little wheel is tedious.As for video...the limit of 10 minutes of video at a time is pretty stupid.  I could see it if it was to accommodate the 4gb file size of fat 32 but 10 minutes of video at the highest resolution possible results in a file of less than 2gb.  They could easily have gone with a 20 minute limit.  The other thing about the video is the .mov (Adobe Flash) format of the video files.  Just about the only thing that will play them is a computer with Flash installed.  None of my standalone players will play them.  You have to spend the time to convert them (and btw...the software that comes with the camera does not export any readable formats so you will have to use some other software to do that.)  That all assumes that you just try to load the memory card via USB and not use the camera to play the files.Last...use fast, high quality memory cards (I am using Class 10 PNY cards and they seem to work well.)Again, I like the camera and all of these negatives only cost it 1 star!", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Had problems but thats ok!", "Author": "S.

It goes back and forth from blurry to clear then blurry to clear in a matter of seconds.  The Canon rep had me to disable the IS which didn't fix it.  Then I was told to tap the shutter to focus prior to recording.  It failed again.  The third rep said the camera was defective.  I'll be returning the camera to Bestbuy but I will be getting another one.  Hopefully that one will be ok.  If someone has a suggestion please let me know.

Features like Face recognition, Blink detection. Poster, Miniature, Fisheye & Color Accent to name a few. Has a decent zoom as well. 12x Optical. As an aspiring novice, this is a great carry around for me to work on continuing honing my photography skills.It uses 2 AA batteries. It's a good thing & bad thing. Good because I don't have to have an outlet to recharge if I don't have a spare (like with the lithium ones on my SX50). Bad because especially in the colder weather the batteries drain faster & it does make the camera a little heavier. Not that it weighs a ton mind you.Overall I'm very happy with this camera.

So one of the main things I was looking for was some manual controls (aperture, shutter, full manual mode) to learn using those. But as said before I did not have a lot of money and wanted a camera that I can easily take with me.Finding a Point-and-shoot that allows manual controls immediately minimies the options so in the end I went with the SX130IS. And after almost a year of use I think it's well worth it.What I like:- 12x Zoom (optical). I like to take pictures of animals and being able to zoom in helps a lot with not scaring them away- In association to the zoom: the camera can also take very good close-up makro shots- Image stabilisation. So even in zoom mode or for slower shutter speeds the camera still manages to produce sharp images- The resolution. Resolution is not everything, but it sure is nice to be able to crop and still have a good-sized image- Manual controls (obviously)Some things that are not that great:- For a point-and-shoot the camera is abit thicker than I expected- Low light conditions get problematic (which is to be expected from a camera like that)- Taking several shots in succession doesn't work too well since the camera takes a while to write a picture to the card- The dynamic range is low, which often leads to blown out skies (again, might be expected from this type of camera)- For some reason my white balance always was a bit off, no matter which setting I chose. Many images had king of a blue hue to them and also colors were often a bit dull. Those problems could however easily be corrected in post-processing.Although it seems like I have a lot to complain about, it is nit-picking and really can't be expected to be handled from a small and low-priced camera like this one. Actually if there is a better camera for that prize, I would like to know about it; it's hard for me to imagine. (As I am writing this, its successor, the SX150IS actually is cheaper; so maybe give that a try).If you are looking for a low-budget point-and-shoot with some room for experimentation and learning, go grab it!", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is good with the money", "Author": "AnhMy Tran \"Love playing Violin and Piano\"", "ReviewID": "RRV0RM4P7KEI0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is not good at focusing to the close objects.No matter how I do, how method, how function, I cannot take a picture at acceptable quality.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast Power-Up, Beautiful Pics & Vids, Limited Video Length, Long Next-Shot-Delay", "Author": "gottlieb1885", "ReviewID": "R3Q7TN7DQDN4EP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for work, which involves simply taking pictures of retail products. It works fine for that purpose, and I'm always impressed with the picture quality once I get the photos on a computer so I can edit them.Not too long ago, my much nicer personal camera took a splash in the ocean, so I've gotten some experience using this one for general shutter-bugging. As stated, the pictures and videos are beautiful - and the fast power-up is much appreciated.The worst problem I have with this camera is the next-shot-delay. This is the amount of time it takes until the camera is ready to shoot the next picture, and this has been a problem with most digital cameras from the very beginning. I'm not referring to the time it takes to recharge the flash between shots, but rather the most basic daytime non-flash photography.When simply taking pictures of products for work, it's not an issue. For general photography, it's a problem which will likely result in missed picture opportunities.For instance, I recently took the camera on a kayaking trip and it was very difficult to capture birds & animals due to the fact that both I and the wildlife I was photographing were constantly moving. Normally I'd just take multiple shots of the same subject to get a decent 'keeper'. With this camera, however, the next-shot-delay absolutely kills this 'double-tap' style of picture taking.Another problem I ran into was that there is apparently a 10 minute limit to the length of a video clip. This is not due to the memory card being full, and you can simply start recording a new video with another press of the shutter button. The problem is that sometimes I need the thing to just keep recording, and don't have the luxury of running over to start it recording again.For instance, I was recently pulled out of an audience to play stand-in guitar for a band whose guitarist didn't show up. It was a real honor, and I set my camera up to record it. This is exactly the type of unpredictable situation in which you really need a camera to simply function as expected. I played rhythm guitar for the first few songs, but was allowed some solo time during a break later on. I killed it and was anxious to review my performance. Unfortunately, all I got was the first ten minutes of me playing rhythm guitar, then the video stopped before the good stuff happened. Plenty of room left on the SD card, but the camera stopped recording at the 10-minute mark.While I realize this is a budget-priced camera, the video length limit is unintuitive, unnecessary, and surely not related to the cost of making the camera. It's just poor design which defies the reasonable expectation that the camera should record video up to the limitation of its memory capacity.The bottom line is that this camera takes impressive pictures and videos for its price, but you definitely need to consider whether the long next-shot-delay and video length limitation will work for your purpose before buying it.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice for travel camera", "Author": "GalCalif \"Visit my Amazon Profile page!\"", "ReviewID": "R2K6NNM67S8RFR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera very much as a the single compact size camera for travel. It has a decent zoom range, takes nice close up photos and is very compact with the huge bonus for me of using regular AA batteries so I can be certain to never run out.The ability to zoom in and out during movie filming is nice, and not all cameras have this ability.There are two things which I at first did not understand with this camera which made me think it was not as great as it really could be once I understood how it worked.Focus when in telephotoThe distance where you can get a good focus is a little shorter than it reads on screen (it displays the minimum focus distance briefly in the upper left of the screen when you zoom in or out). If you get the yellow box with the exclamation point instead of the green focus box, it is likely that you need to zoom out a little bit and try again. I thought at first the camera had focus problems, but is just because when you zoom it limits the focus close distance quite a bit.Focus when in MacroFor close up shots, either use Auto mode (where the camera chooses most everything including focus Auto/Normal), or make sure you select the Macro focus mode before you try to take the shot. If you do select macro, it takes amazing close up shots with good light. It is easy to forget to set to Macro focus mode.Colors and Skin ToneAt first I was very unhappy because often people's faces would appear orange or weird colors. I thought this was a problem with the camera, but it turns out it is just with the default color settings and can easily be fixed by using the camera's built in color adjustment settings.I use the so called 'Custom Colors' setting (press the Func Set button inside the rotating dial on the back, then select the colors option below the AWB option on the screen, navigate across the little icons on the bottom to the last one called Custom Color, press DISP. button on lower left back panel and then change the parameters as follows:For Custom Color parameter, there are 5 vertical lines (I call them 1 to 5 from left to right), to the right is 'more' and to the left is 'less' of whatever the parameter.Set them as follows:Contrast 4 (or 5)Skin Tone 1Saturation 3 (or 4)Red 3Green 3Blue 3Sharpness 5You will find that the skin tone problem pretty much vanishes and most all pictures are nicer!The only thing that takes a star away is that it is not good in low light situations.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent pictures, poor functionality", "Author": "marlowejack", "ReviewID": "R3LYU3MV5FXNMI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a gift.

The photo quality is what you would expect from a 12 mp camera.  The zoom lens works well, build quality is good, hd videos turn out great, and the image stabilizer does its job.  I had grand expectation for this camera as it was an upgrade from my 6 year old 4 mp camera.  My grand expectations were gradually replaced by general disappointment.  I have four main problems with the camera:1.  lag time - the time between pictures is terrible.  It will often take 3-10 seconds to record the photo on the memory card before it's ready to shoot again.  I tried several memory cards, all high quality fast cards, and the problem persisted with all cards.  When you are using the flash, the lag time between shots gets even more ridiculous.  The flash takes forever to recharge.2.  user interface - the menus on this camera are very non-intuitive.  The scroll wheel navigating button is great.  However, the menu itself takes a long time to get used to.3.  auto mode - this is supposed to be a nice point and shoot camera - however to get a decent photo, I've had to manually adjust things like white balance and shutter speed.  I rarely get decent quick shots using auto.4.  battery life - this things eats regular alkalines for breakfast.  The convenience of a standard battery size is quickly outweighed by the cost of frequent replacement.

When one looks at a camera to buy, there's a few things to note, and I'll go on to cover how the SX130 fares in these cameras. Also remember, some specific things, as well as general things that a customer may look for may vary from one to the other, so keep your personal wants in mind.1. Picture Quality: The SX130 is amazing. The quality is almost negligible compared to a DSLR unless at higher magnifications. The picture is vivid, sharp, clear and fresh, and will guarantee you can capture moments, action shots and beautiful nature.2. Camera Settings: Camera settings is basically things like the modes it has and its f-stop ranges (aperture), shutter speeds, ISO and more. The SX130 does excellent in all these. The shutter speed is beyond good, even for fast action shots. The ISO is also comparatively high, and better than needed in most cases, however, for night photography a different camera may be desired. The aperture range is decent, but not amazing. You'll need a better range to take those \"professional\" photos. Also, the settings can be seen on the camera specs.3.Battery Life, Durability and Portability: The SX130's battery life is one of its major pitfalls. The battery life is so small that on larger photo trips you may even need to pack extra batteries! The manual says it can take 130 shots on a normal lithium battery, but more like 60, for me at least. For the durability, the camera seems solid for the most part. It has a bit of weight too it, that can be perceived negatively and positively, but overall, it seems strong. However, there seems to be something loose inside, that may or may not be intentional. The portability is also fine, however the battery powered function of the camera makes it weigh a bit more than it should.4. Price: Amazing. Its a bang for your buck. The quality of performance coming from this camera demands a higher price. Definitely good if you're on a budget but still want great photos.Anything not covered is things I haven't checked out yet (the video function, for example.)", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fine camera", "Author": "Joyce", "ReviewID": "R3VUXADFT4BLAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cannot give anyone a big essay on this Canon's separate features because there are so many different kind of things it can do.

I also look to see if the buttons are bubbles or have fancy colors. That usually means the software is going to be no good. This camera has no BS menus with three colors. You can find everything easily and deleting is only a few buttons per picture. It also has a nice feature where you can select two pictures, and it will delete everything in between.

I have gotten some really great photos using the Macro Photography setting and I love it! The focus is great and you get wonderful bokeh when focusing on a close object. The manual setting allows you to do a lot, which is great for simple, creative shooting. You can get nice bokeh with the manual focus setting, and its very simple to make fun photos using a long exposure. The photo quality is great. As for the video, the quality is good. But I've found that even doing a video in front of a white wall, it tends to shift in and out of focus constantly. But if your wanting to focus on something detailed and raise it close to the camera it's great. So the video has it's ups and downs, and the cameras own noise while fliming tends to be able to hear when replaying the video. As for the bettery life, it's not the best, especially using video.

They come out so crystal clear (most of them, not so much with my wiggly baby as the subject!) and the colors are so bright, and true.  I haven't even begun to look at all the options on the camera, haven't had to since it takes great pics in the SCN modes.  I am really looking forward to reading up on it and experimenting.  I really don't think you can be disappointed with a Canon camera.  I definitely agree on the comments about the battery life...I took maybe 100 pictures on 1 set of batteries (the ones that came with it) but I already bought the Rayovac rechargeables NiMH so I expect to see a huge improvement.

The optical image stabilization for the 12x optical zoom lens produces clear, crisp 12-Megapixel images from wide angle to telephoto.  For quick and easy shots the Auto mode or simpler still, the Easy mode allow anyone to produce fine pictures.  Yet for those wanting more creative control they can choose from a host of Program modes, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, or even fully Manual mode.  All in a compact camera that can conveniently fits in a belt case.As for power source I am a fan of using AA-type batteries.  I like my portable devices to work well with rechargeable AAs so I only have to carry one kind of charger.  Plus it is comforting that in the worst case scenario I can walk into any convenience store and pick-up some alkaline batteries and keep going.

Its a little bit heavy and bulky, so if you're looking for something slim and cute its probably not the best choice for you. The picture quality is really good though, and for a camera thats under 200$ I was really impressed with the zoom. I've heard some complaints that the manual controls were too complicated, but just from playing around I was able to figure out how to (basically) make any adjustments I wanted. I'm not a photographer, so I can't say anything about technical stats or hardware, but I've really enjoyed the camera and think that it takes really nice photos.

Sam's Club had the SX-130 on clearance for 159.00, so I purchased it.At first, I was ecstatic with my sample shots, but as time went on, I saw more & more blurry / fuzzy images...especially indoors. It has gotten to the point where I have to take three or more shots of the same subject just to find one that is marginally acceptable. I mainly use Auto, and sometimes Easy mode, but I will use Program & Aperture mode if I want to change a setting or two.The camera works best in bright daylight situations, but even then, image quality is not as sharp as I like. Ironically, some of my low-light sunset shots looked pretty good in Program mode with Exposure Compensation set to -1.I am beginning to wonder if the IS (image stabilization) function is not working as well as it should after reading many favorable reviews, here, and elsewhere. I always wait for the double-beep sound (confirming the focus has been set) before taking my shots, and I always make sure that none of the shutter speed and focal length numbers are in orange, too. I try not to use the optical zoom too much - unless I can brace myself more effectively, and I definitely don't use the digital zoom (I turned that feature off).Many have complained about the short life of disposable AA batteries, and I can concur with that because my first pair lasted about an hour as I was learning how to use the SX-130. Even rechargeable Rayovac Platinum batteries last for less than 100 shots, but that is not an issue for me because I can always carry an extra pair - or two - if needed.This is my first digital camera purchase, and I have much to learn about the various controls and shooting options with this model. Thank God for the internet and the many web sites I have discovered to better explain how things work because the provided manual does not go into great detail, and Canon does not have any online tutorials that I am aware of, either.I am using a SanDisk 8gb class 4 card ($12.00 - Big Lots). Would switching to a class 10 card ensure better photo quality? Someone posted a review, here, admitting as much after they consulted with a knowledgeable camera rep at Best Buy.If a faster card does not help my image quality then I will exchange this model for the SX-150 - although the unit I played with at Sam's Club had horrible charge time for the flash - the sample images I took looked pretty sharp in my opinion. However, I noticed some major distortion in a shot or two along the edges. The SX-150 was set to the \"L\" size (A2)...could that have been part of the edge distortion problem?", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for great price", "Author": "Selena", "ReviewID": "R2A99JPINKZWHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a little over a year ago and been very happy with the purchase.

The Auto on the SD1000 blows it away with no image stabilization. Lower light indoor shots were simply unusable.I love Canon but this camera is definitely not for me. If you're doing nothing but bright daylight zoom shooting then this might be a good option. Oh, and don't forget an extra stockpile of rechargeable batteries. The batteries that came in the box lasted a total of about a half hour total of non-continuous shooting and I didn't even try taking any video.Had it not had all of the issues above I might still have been disappointed with the large size. After using it in real-life situations chasing a two-year-old I realized the zoom is less important to me than ultra-compact size. I returned the SX130IS for an SD1400IS and I couldn't be happier! The 4x zoom is plenty, wide-angle lens is fantastic, and shots look amazing.Canon still has the goods, just not in this model.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Noisy images even at ISO 80", "Author": "The_Digital_Dude", "ReviewID": "RSGI92FOWE0MI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Wow, I read all the positive reviews of the Canon PowerShot SX130IS and promptly picked one up on sale.  Our old Canon PowerShot A700 has been showing its age with some hot red pixels on the sensor, so this seemed like a good try for a replacement.  I took a couple dozen pictures, some even at ISO 80, and nothing in the menu settings or configuration of the SX130IS is able to resolve the excessive image noise, which pretty much ruins detail.  The chromatic aberration on this thing is fairly bad, even at this price level.  It's also mighty battery hungry.  Even with the same Duracell NiMH batteries I use in the A700, freshly charged, the camera died and shut off after a few minutes of initially setting the time, turning off the sounds, setting image quality to the best available settings in Program mode, etc., and I hadn't even taken any pictures yet.  Maybe the Duracells have had it, so the next step would have been to try some of the Sanyo Eneloop rechargeables that others recommend.I've owned multiple Canon DSLRs since 2000, so I wasn't expecting anything close to a DSLR, but I did expect it to be better than the A700 point and shoot, which it certainly isn't.  Even accounting for the difference in 6 megapixels for the A700 compared to 12 megapixels for the SX130IS, the A700 takes clearer pictures (relatively speaking).  What's really weird is that the filesize is nearly the same of identically shot images of the same static scene by both cameras at best quality settings in Program mode, as if the newer camera is applying excessive JPEG compression, even in Fine mode.  A much larger resolution should result in a much larger file, hello?So, with the noisier compression at highest quality and the comparatively much worse chromatic aberration, I sadly will have to return the SX130IS and keep looking.  I actually will be willing to pay even twice this price for a point and shoot if it gives noticeably better results than this model.  I wasn't expecting DSLR quality, and the A700 is far from it, but this is definitely a step down.

There were a few issues in the beginning, most of which I have sorted out, but some design glitches remain.This is a fairly large and heavy unit for a point-and-shoot, but it's almost as hard to grip as a subcompact. The right end of the body is thinner than the rest, and that's where the power button, shutter release, zoom lever, and all the controls on the back are located. It's difficult to grasp and manipulate the camera, especially one-handed, without inadvertently activating something. There is a tiny thumb rest on the back, but it's to high and too close to the shutter release for comfort. The finger grip on the front is too close to the end, and the body surface is slippery. I have average size hands, and this camera appears to have been designed for someone much smaller with stickum on their fingers.I like the flip-up flash that I can choose manually instead of electronically, but the lip of the flash head is too small to ensure a quick flip into position.Most importantly, though, the photos are gorgeous. Low-light shots without flash tend to be grainy, but every other condition has resulted in sharp and bright pics.I was torn between this Canon and the Nikon L110 and settled on this because the automatic lenses cover and the better pocketability would make it a bit more convenient in the field.

I've used this camera with a variety of alkaline batteries from Duracell to Energizer, as well as Duracell and other brands of re-chargeable battery but all have the same result, pathetically short battery life.I called Canon CS, who knew nothing about short battery life and suggested using lithium batteries instead.My other current point and shoot camera, a Canon SD1100iS can use the same proprietary battery for an exponentially longer period of time. In fact I use it more than the SX130iS as a result.As mentioned in other reviews, if you have a truckload of batteries that you wish to carry around, then this camera will perform very well indeed.For me, the battery life is the Achilles Heel with an otherwise quality product from Canon.I know I wouldn't buy one again - simply based on the battery life - it's just too much effort and you may well miss out on a lot of shots as a result if not fully prepared.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better buy a LARGE box of batteries", "Author": "cltucci", "ReviewID": "R1T0PBMWJSJQ1A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Yes, I read the reviews first, and had my eyes wide open when I bought this, and I admit I was warned.

I have to say that I have been pleased with the camera and liked enough that when it broke I replaced it with a newer model I have though compiled a list of pros and cons.Cons:-BATTERIES: Uses AA (which it seems to use rather quickly) I really wish that it could be rechargeable\u2026just plug in and charge but I solved this issue by purchasing rechargeable AA and I always have a pair ready and charged.-CLOSURE: Did not like the battery and SD card closure. Since the camera tends to eat up the batteries rather quickly, you have to switch them out often\u2026after 3 years of usage the flap or the door that locks the battery in place started to break and sometimes it failed to close correctly leaving me with several attempts to close it right.-FLASH: The flash you have to pop up manually\u2026which I guess could be a nuisance but what bothers me the most is the fact that after so many times of lifting the flash up the hinges snapped and the flash failed to engage (reason why I am replacing it)-SIZE: This camera is not very slim in size so placing it in your pant pocket is definitely out of the question (well you can but it will be a tight fit)-ZOOM: Since the zoom lens retracts and extends anything that gets caught in there really could screw it up. As an example to the kids to the beach and some sand got in the lens causing it to fail to close, I had to sit there clean it out before it finally closed.Pros:-IMAGE: The colors in the image are amazing to me! Especially when shooting indoors or fast moving kids, this is actually the whole reason I am sticking with this brand and camera. I think that the image quality far outweighs all the cons!- EASY- Very easy to use!!!- SETTINGS: Love all the different settings! Especially the color swap or color keep! When I was pregnant I tied a solid color bow around my belly and took a black and white picture but kept the color of the bow! It was not perfect of course but with a little editing it looked amazing!Overall I like this camera, I think if Cannon would make a built in flash and a rechargeable battery that you can just plug into the camera (kind of like a cell phone) this would be a huge winner!", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot", "Author": "Carol Cottrill", "ReviewID": "R2N8CROO9E9DYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a while and have to say it really does take good pictures.I love this camera and am very well pleased with it.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot SX 130", "Author": "Da Lowrider", "ReviewID": "R1I6PC11601S3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a fun little point and shoot camera.

It does this while analyzing your distance and lighting. I look forward to using it for many years but there's one thing I don't like - no instruction book except on the CD. I printed all 174 pages so that proves how much this camera can do. Take your copies to have hold punched and a binding. I paid less than $5 for that! The green booklet is 34 pages and only a Quick Guide. Users want the full instructions on paper when away from home. I want to know everything and understand all the features and my memory isn't that great. I'm really annoyed at the big watermark (\"COPY\") across the middle of every page - including the cover. I don't have one bad thing to say about the camera. Images are outstanding, it's easy to use and a very reasonable price.

Wanted something similar to Canon A590IS I got as a spouse present in Dec 2008, but that camera is no longer on the market except from places like eBay, as used (two purchased tries resulted in fatally defective items received each time) or as new (much more expensive than original pricing or for present similar new cameras). The A590 is a nice camera with a good features/price ratio, a viewfinder that was becoming a rare feature even in 2008, but a less-than-stellar AA battery life that was finally resolved by using more appropriate battery types than Canon recommended (see remarks at end of this review).There are not many digital cameras with viewfinders on the market these days for less than a quite a few hundred dollars, so the closest that I thought might have the photo quality/features similar to the A590 was the Canon SX130IS. For a side-by-side comparison any current two cameras, see the camera-catalog.com to set up your desired comparisons. As a side note, my understanding is that the later Canon SX150IS follow-up model now on the market is a relatively minor upgrade of the SX130.The SX130 has many the positive features of the A590 (but enhanced), and some of the negatives (e.g. long flash cycle times, need for better AA batteries), with a few minor feature (for my uses) differences. The most obvious differences I see are that the SX130 is slightly larger/heavier, has more megapixels per photo, a larger optical zoom (12X vs. 4X), but lacks a viewfinder and an auto flash. The flash must be flipped up manually when indicated while in Auto mode, but the camera will operated whether the flash is up or not (sometimes photo looks fine without flash). Since I'm use to mounting a separate flash unit as needed for my old 35mm camera, the manual feature doesn't bother me, as I thought it an advantage if I want to easily NOT allow the flash while in Auto mode for lower light distance photos. The lack of a viewfinder is a real disadvantage, as it's much easier than a LCD screen for photo composition, and especially in bright sunlight it become very difficult too see the LCD screen unless one turns up the screen brightness to max (just about see scene sometimes).Some items to note: - A paper user guide is not provided, you have to use the digital PDF copy off the included CD or downloaded it from the Canon website. A major inconvenience in my view, now one needs a computer system just to read something to learn or look up something about the various features/settings. - There is no SD card included with the SX130, not even a pathetically small 32MB card like with the A590, so one can not immediately test the SX130 right out of the box unless  a spare SD card is available. - As with other digital cameras, the included Canon bloated software takes up umpteen megabytes of computer hard-disk. I did not use that software as there is better free Internet downloadable free stuff available for photos downloading/organization/editing. Also, it easier for me just to take the SD card out and put into a cheap USB reader (available for a few dollars from eBay, Meritline, Amazon, etc.) and transfer the photos to a computer just like with any other flash drive.Once we got my spouse's A590 model's perennial Canon short AA battery life issues (see other Amazon and other forums' reviews) resolved by using either Energizer Ultimate lithium (4X or 8X) or Sanyo Eneloop (slow discharge rate when not being used) rechargables, that camera has provided fine service. Using regular alkaline or regular rechargeable NiMH AA batteries can be a waste of money/time as too many folks may never get any more than a very small fraction of the number of  the shots exaggeratedly claimed in the Canon camera specifications for a set  of these battery types. If the camera design and/or normal manufacturing variations are such that some non-trivial number of units (judging from the reviews) really need some specific types of  AAs for better/acceptable performance, then Canon would better serve itself and its customers by not put ting possibly misleading shot numbers for using alkalines or your average store-bought rechargables. See my Amazon 1/31/09 A590 review and later 6/25/12 Comments note about the Canon A590 and batteries at http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZKZJ5U6K19V/ref=cm_cd_notf_message/176-3175168-1504157?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=Fx63B1EKY0E2BL&cdPage;=1&cdThread;=Tx1I9RO32Y8R49X#MxYYFXHZN76US6Since my Sept 2011 SX130 purchase, the camera has operated well for me using the Energizer Ultimate lithium or Sanyo Eneloop batteries. I get several hundred photos per pair from the lithiums, and as of 8/28/12 I've shot more than 120 photos so far with a pair of Eneloops straight out of the blister pack (not been in a charger) and no sign of a battery low indication yet even though the Eneloops were originally purchased near the end of June 2012.12/31/12 Batteries Update:I used the above mentioned pair of AA Sanyo Eneloop (newer 1500X charges model) 2000 mAH low self-discharge NiMH batteries (right out of the blister pack) for the past 6 months and got 160 shots before the low battery indication came on.  When the Eneloops start off fully charged instead of just out of the product packaging, I'm expecting they may give me closer to 300 shots or more.

It has the power and features available in larger, pricier cameras but the portability to go anywhere, and it's quite resilient to damage.So, then -- list time:PROS:-Compact and portable, will easily fit into a pocket.-Excellent Zoom, puts my Eos Rebel T3i to shame. Doubles for a pair of binoculars now and then.-A Macro function, which is a special point of interest for some. It won't match dedicated macro lenses or cameras, but having it certainly makes a difference in your photos.-Around 9000 other features. Not literally, but this camera can handle a good variety of challenges and be set to perform quite a lot of functions, from portrait to landscape shots.-For its price point, it takes good photos and video. Pricier cameras would take better photos and video... but you would have to go more than double on the expense for that to happen.-There aren't any weird tints to your photos with this camera.-Runs on two AA batteries, which is great when you're traveling.-Having a wrist strap, while common to many cameras, is still a pro when the camera is small enough to fit in one hand.-You can control the entire camera with your right hand.CONS:-You better have a lot of AA batteries. Battery life, depending on use, can range from 3-7 hours... unless you are taking photos very quickly or taking video, in which case two hours would be impressive.-Ten minute video length, max -- you can take as many videos as your memory card allows, but none of them will be longer than ten minutes.-If dust gets into the (irremovable) lens (it will,) you will know. And may the force be with you in trying to remove it on your own.-Some people won't find the video or sound quality up to snuff. Additionally, trying to play a video on some computers will often necessitate a download of the Combined Community Codec Pack. Windows doesn't like MP4s, for some reason.-It's a little slow, especially under low-light conditions.-The LCD screen is built-in to the camera -- it doesn't flip out.-It's also your viewfinder.This particular Powershot is my favorite of the series. It's never let me down, it can go anywhere with me, and it lets me photograph moths and landscapes with equal success. It has a myriad of features, and most of them aren't novelty gimmicks.

It does not include a memory stick so it's advisable to order one with the camera if you don't have spares lying around the house. I happened to have a 1GB SanDisk so I used that until the 16GB that I ordered came in to replace it.We found the camera setup to be quick and painless; there is a quick start booklet in print form but the more comprehensive 180 page user manual is only available as a pdf file which comes on the installation CD. One thing the booklet was careful to point out was the importance of formatting the memory stick by the camera. This took less than a minute using the camera's menu so it was really no trouble; setting time and date was also very easy to do.The software that comes with the camera is called ZoomBrowser and so far seems to be doing a good job. There are the usual number of editing options including trimming, color adjustment, red eye, plus stitching which permits the creating of panorama pictures.The suggested method of transferring the photos to ones computer is by a patch cord which comes with the camera; it requires a USB port on the computer and automatically starts the transfer process with a few clicks. We have taken a number of pictures with the camera attached to a tripod and have gotten excellent results so far.The camera has more bells and whistles than we will ever use but it's nice to know they're there just in case.

I want to make sure that they won't lose charge while not using the camera, and can recharge, to save money.Only negative: About 4 or 5 days after purchasing this camera, it ended up being fulfilled by Amazon and was $30 cheaper, and free 2 day shipping (with Prime, which I have).

Unlike the SX110 this will set automatically to high ISO under really low light conditions, unlike the SX110 where in Auto mode you had a choice of HI and Normal ISO. Also there is no self timer in Easy mode. Pictures taken at ISO above 400 come out really grainy, then again, there is nothing new to me in that department, I deal with it by shooting in Tv or Manual mode.As for the rest the camera performs as expected.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R2892SK4PAR55E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned a few Canon cameras, the A60, the A570, 300D and an S5.When my S5 went on the fritz, I decided to grab a low cost feature rich alternative as a standby until I bought a higher end DSLR. On paper the SX130 was the answer. High megapixel, strong zoom, large LCD screen, hi-res video....But IMO, it doesn't do any of those things well, or even acceptable for a low cost camera. By now  you've probably read about the horrible battery life. I experienced it first hand. I now realize why they limit the video to 10 minutes - because after about 12 minutes of video you're going to drain two brand new double AA batteries to the point that the camera will shut down. I have never used two batteries in less than 15 minutes for anything before, much less a camera- which leads me to my second complaint and that is limiting me to 10 minutes of video sucks. Yes, I know its a camera but in the age of 32gb and 64gb SD cards, Canon should trust me to decide how much video I want to shoot. Try video taping anything that last longer than 10 minutes - like realizing you are the only person with video capability at a recognition ceremony and have to stop and start it twice with gaps (and then have to use video editing software to put it all together).Finally, this camera is horrible at action shots. I took several photos at a recent wedding where someone in a group shot was moving only to have everyone in focus except the person moving. You couldn't even see their face details. I'm sure using something other than \"auto\" would have helped but the whole point of a competent point and shoot is that I don't have to worry with these kinds of details. Its to be expected that I should be able to take a photo without these kinds of issues. My Canon A570 is a much better camera (and yes I did pay more for it but you'd think that technology after several years would be included in the newer SX130). Even the LCD screen is snowy and dark.I'm a bit of a Canon snob but I'd rather have a Fuji, Olympus or even a Kodak in the price range I paid for this worthless camera.It does take good pictures but the conditions have to be perfect for it - lighting, movement, battery life, etc. It produces far too many substandard photos to make this a camera I'd trust for a once in a lifetime event.

Regular AA alkaline batteries drain pretty fast, so I got the expensive rechargable Canon batteries it made a big difference. I could take dozens and dozens of photos without having to recharge. However, after about a year, all of my batteries (new or used, rechargable or not) started to drain quickly while the camera was off. I don't use it much, so this was a problem whenever I wanted to grab it and take a quick picture. The behavior was disappointing and confusing, because previously, I could leave it off for long periods and there was no problem. This week, I put in a fresh pair of alkalines to see what would happen. I did not even turn it on, and a couple of days later, the batteries are completely dead.There is definitely a problem with some part of the camera -- something broke or shorted out. I don't know, but I passed the 2-year store warranty recently, which is a lesson I had to learn. I would not buy this camera again.The focus and color and quality is not very reliable either. Sometimes the pictures are good, but other times the pictures are inexplicably dark or out of focus. The manual focus ring is too difficult to use quickly. I bought it because of the 12x zoom, but the focus is unreliable depending on the mode. And the variety of modes don't make much sense or much difference either.Too bad. I feel like I cannot trust Canon products anymore because of the problems I've had. I can't even give this to my mom if I upgrade. It kind of works, but it's confusing and she won't have any understanding of why the battery dies so quickly. I feel like I wasted two hundred plus on something that is now a piece of junk.

I look forward to using it at family events etc this year.Updated Sept 29 - Love this camera more every day! I have taken shots with little effort that I could never get before! Every day I see something in a different way because I have a camera that will get the details.

If you set the video to the lowest settings it will last about an hour (I'm told by Canon USA tech support.)In short, you get what you pay for.

I already knew it as a great camera two years ago I was sent one from the college I was attending for one of my classes  the school wanted every one to have the same camera, so they sent everyone in the class a Powershot SX130IS. The down side to my first one was finding out after I slipped and fell in to the water while attempting to get a photo that the camera was not water proof to any extent. The camera sub merged for about three to five seconds. The camera was never the same after and presently no longer works. I decided as soon as I could I would buy another Powershot SX130IS to replace the first one, and I did that here at Amazon.com. I figured I couldn't go wrong $60.00 for a camera that Walmart was getting $199.95 for last summer, and canon wanted $299.00 for. I'd say I save my self a nice little bundle. and the photos it takes in my opinion far exceed the manufacturers expectations. For a point and shoot camera honestly Canon out did themselves. I put copies of all my photos on my IGoogle account and on my face book account to share with all my friends. So that they can see how well the Canon Powershot SX130IS works. My next Camera will be a canon Rebel more then likely a T3i later this year when the leaves start to turn.

A friend, who has the same camera, suggested Lithium batteries.  He said that he got almost 200 shots out of a set of batteries.  I haven't tried them yet, to be honest.  The other thing is the time it takes between shots.  It seems quite slow. It could be the possibility that I'm just used to my Nikon COOLPIX P90 digital camera.  As far as picture quality... It takes excellent detailed pictures. The video quality is very good.  The different functions of the camera are outstanding for a economically priced camera.

I am an experienced photographer.  The camera takes excellent quality pictures, or at least it did until recently.  I noticed that the pics I took in August seemed slightly out of focus and I thought I must have done something wrong on the day I used it.  However I just got out the camera again to take to a lacrosse tournament where my grandson was an outstanding player, and I wanted to get some good photos of him and his team, both still shots and during the action.  I was horribly disappointed to find that the pictures were in sharp focus on the right side of the picture and fuzzy or blurry on the left side.  My grandson played in the championship game in the Yale Stadium last Saturday and the pics were useless--and there is no way obviously to replace the situation.I contacted Canon, they pointed out what I already knew, that the camera was out of warranty (even though it was shortly after the warranty expired that the problem showed up) and that it would cost $139 to have it repaired plus parts if needed, when I paid $169 for it new.  I was shocked at Canon's attitude and extremely disappointed that this camera failed after so short a time.  So I have learned a valuable lesson.  Canon is not what it used to be and the quality is just not there any more now that these cameras are made in China and their service is just not up to their reputation any longer.Updated November 24, 2013.

I did not experience the poor battery life that some have reported, and I always used standard batteries.  Second,I never had any problem with the zoom.  Third, I spent a lot of time yesterday attempting various solutions to the image focus problem, using various settings (with autofocus, and manually) to see if I could find any combination of settings that would make any difference, and regrettably, nothing would make any difference--the left side of photos (when in horizontal position) were just slightly out of focus, just enough so that I can see it looking closely.

If you pick the wrong mode your picture will be drastically worse than optimal.If you dont use the correct mode the picture will be so blurry you cant even make out the faces of your subjects.Video also has problems.  Any movement of the camera causes the video to be blurry and it takes up to 5 seconds for the camera to refocus.  5 second lapse and you could miss the subject or event of your video.Lastly battery life can be a problem unless you use newly charged NiMh batteries with high capacities or dont mind eating through normal AAs.All that said I have only used the camera about 2 or 3 hours.

It comes with 2 Alkaline batteries and I forgot to take the NiMH rechargables (that I also got in one of those camera bundles deals at amazon) on my trip. This can chew up batteries within minutes (I kid you not!!) - in movie mode, within seconds (seemingly) it will start warning you about batteries needing replacement. I wish Canon had managed to get 4 batteries instead of 2 AA batteries into this body. (Hence the 4 stars).Also having to manually move the flash up (it doesn't pop, you have to swing it up and open) can become a chore but you'll see the message asking you to do that when the camera detects it.Finally limiting the movie being shot to about 10 minutes (720p resolution) only for a single shot (the movie is then \"written\" to the SD card) seems kinda limiting.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Blurry and Slow", "Author": "BookGirl \"BookGirl\"", "ReviewID": "R35DLWMFYXVA3Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I took the time to learn the features and was really excited about this camera. . especially the insane price.  Unfortunately, I'd say over 85% of my pictures were super blurry.  Yes, I was adjusting ISO and various settings and playing with flash, yes I know how to use the camera.  I was still wondering if it were me, so I gave the camera to some experienced photographers who set down their fancy Canon and Nikon DSLRs and played with mine on Christmas.  They, too, got nothing but blurry pictures.  Maybe it was my in-laws living room lighting. . .but everyone else at the party (from the cheap Fuji users to the pro DSLR users) took great pics.  Even my SIL's camera phone took better pics.  I also tried it at a restaurant with decent light and still blurry.  However, I did get some gorgeous lowlight pics of our Christmas tree and I was amazed at the sharpness. But when 85% of my pics come out blurry, that's a one star rating for me.  It's unreliable.  I think camera companies spend too much time adding cool features to their point and shoots or try to make them look cute like a DSLR. .when what we really need is something that's compact, feels nice in the hand, and takes amazing pics easily.  Forget the cool features. . .if we wanted cool features we'd get a $400 P&S; or a DSLR.  I think they are all missing a market in P&S; and that's why some think P&S; are becoming obsolete. . which they should NOT be.  It seems you either get a crappy P&S; or a pricey one like the s95 for $400 that mimics a DSLR.  Then, next up is the DSLR.  What about a nice P&S; at $250 that is reliable and compact and well-made?  For this, I'm going to try the Canon SX 210 IS next.  If that fails me, I guess I'm going to suck it up and get that $400 s95.Also, this camera is heavy and huge for a point and shoot.  Again, if I wanted a huge, heavy camera, I'd pay for a DSLR.I did like the manual flash.  I didn't think I would but I actually think I prefer it. . but that's the only thing this camera has going.

I didn't realize how spoiled I was with the quality  until I got this camera. The quality in Auto is just horrible, in my opinion. I'm sorry, but my 6 year old p&s; Canon S1 took much better pictures (I sold it to buy this one, thinking that technology has improved). This is like a toy camera with lots of ways to change around the setting of your picture (making you feel like a real photographer), while the quality you're starting with is really low. The colors are washed out, the contrast is very sharp, the colors are nonexistent. I returned this to get the Canon 780, which I've borrowed in the past and loved. It's smaller with less manual options, but the quality from the get-go is superior, and it's smaller so more convenient.

Got motivated and purchased it this morning and returned it by evening.Wanted to get a compact camera that can do 1080p with a larger display, which would be the two features that my next camera should have, to beat my current Canon Powershot TX1 (which has 720p video and very tiny display). Since, Canon has \"disabled optical zooming during 1080p video recording\" on all their compact cameras, I had to climb down from the 1080p requirement. On the second spec, the large display on this camera is nice.Here are my issues:1. The black body really looks cheap and fragile.2. The controls for manual adjustment is very difficult even for my small hand.3. I have to rotate the dial on top to choose between still shots and movie mode. In my TX1, the shutter button and the video recording buttons are separate and that makes switching between operations a breeze.4. The camera is far heavier than my TX1 and doesn't feel comfortable for video recording.5. A camera with so many features, but no hard copy manual. It is not exactly a point and shoot model and NO MANUAL. You have to print it from the CD-ROM.6. Manual focus feature was new to me on a compact camera and I couldn't get it to do what it claims. I could see the focusing distance bar change, but no change in the image focus.7. You have to MANUALLY pop the built-in flash every time you need the flash! Was this a requirement from the museums that ban flash photography?There are plenty of other features that are not there in my TX1, but they are not a necessity for me.Appended later comments here:My goals for a new compact camera was probably not in line with most buyers/readers. I also own a Canon DSLR and I take that out when I want to shoot flora and fauna. All my cameras from the days of Canon A1 (film SLR) have been Canon. I love the convenience of a compact camera as a single device for both still and high quality video during hikes/camping/skiing/travel/vacation. As I aged, I got a bit tired of lugging my giant Lowepro backpack with all my camera gear. I wish Canon would give me a 1080p camera upgraded from the Canon Powershot TX1 style and with a bigger LCD screen. Currently, Caonon doesn't allow operating the optical zoom while recording in 1080p mode.PS: I did shoot with the camera. It does take nice shots and performs better in low light shooting compared to my TX1.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Can't charge", "Author": "Arthur J Sutton", "ReviewID": "R2OYBI84JP3WC2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "May seem like a minor detail to most, but the fact that you cannot plug in the camera in order to charge the battery is enough of a reason for us to return it.
