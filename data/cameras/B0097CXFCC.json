I hoped for a low-light monster that would provide the critical image quality that I turn to my 5D Mark II for, just in a more portable package. For reference I also own the Canon 35mm L f/1.4.  For better or for worse, this review will be based on my experience with the RX1 compared to the 5D, OM-D and RX100.First the good...1.) The image quality is really that good.  If you read Steve Huff and look at his samples, they are representative. I must admit the lens/camera combo *is capable* of producing images better than my 5D Mark II (see negatives).  the lens is sharper at wide apertures than the Canon.  The high ISO performance is really amazing.  Probably one of the best Full Frame cameras of any form factor with respect to ISO performance.2.) It's well built, if not perfect (more on this in the negatives).  It feels much more solid than the RX100, but not at the level of the 5D or the OM-D.3.) The ergonomics and controls are pretty good for the small form factor.  I like the manual aperture ring and exp. comp. dial, but really I still prefer the ergonomics on both the 5D and OM-D4.) Good Auto features for deep pocketed amateurs. In truth I did not test these features extensivelyNow the Negatives...1.) The camera struggles to focus in anything but good and great light.  In low and moderately low light (read normally lit interior of a home) the camera misses focus on anything that is not static or has high contrast.  Taking pictures of people / faces in these conditions, the camera focuses on the background (which is static and higher contrast) in 30-70% of my shots.  This is very similar to my experience with the NEX 7, another camera I have owned and shot with.  It is truly maddening to have a camera with so much potential that will not nail focus with any consistency. I warn any OM-D E-M5 owners, you will not be satisfied with the focusing performance on this camera unless you only shoot outdoors in good light or shoot still life.  If you like to shoot pictures of kids or any non static people in less than ideal lighting, the camera does not cut it.2.) The ergonomics should be better.  I get the cool look of the camera, but given how far the lens sticks out from the body, Sony could easily have added more grip and better ergonomics without adding to the form factor negatively. The OM-D paired with the very sharp Panasonic 20mm 1.7 or  Leica 25mm 1.4 has a similar form factor but better ergonomics3.) if Olympus can weather seal the $999 OM-D, why can't Sony weather proof the RX1 which has a fixed lens and cost $2,800.00.4.) The lack of image stabilization nullifies some of the ISO performance vs. the OM-D5.) I love the idea of a fast 35mm prime, but for some, $2,800 might be to much to commit into a fixed lens camera.6.) When you spend this much on an item, do companies like Sony really have to price-gouge you on the accessories, like viewfinders and thumb rests!??!?! I digress....7.) the lens does not perform as well at smaller apertures and when focused closer to infinity, so it's not quite as good for landscape shootersAs I mentioned at the beginning, this review has been based on my experience and comparison of the RX1 and my other camera systems.  This camera's sensor and lens are capable of real magic. In the right conditions it is really a dream.  But for me, the RX1 did not fit the bill, literally at $2,799, and figuratively in terms of performance in lower light, which to me is where I would be using it often.Hope this helps someone in deciding.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "An absolutely unique photographic tool that has no peer in the marketplace", "Author": "D. F. Watt \"dfwatt\"", "ReviewID": "RRHUSEFHIFSR4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you managed to get this far through the enormous number of reviews of the camera, you're either a glutton for punishment, are you really are a researcher and aficionado of high-end digital photography.  Let's assume it's the latter and get to the really interesting stuff.This camera is in a class of one.  There's really nothing like it anywhere in the marketplace.  It's absurdly expensive for a point-and-shoot, and yet it takes pictures that rival in overall image quality - and in many cases equal or even exceed - what the very best full frame professional cameras are capable of generating . . . . .  while fitting fairly comfortably in your jacket pocket.  It looks like your neighbor's point-and-shoot $350 Canon, but costs more than your last vacation.  It doesn't even have a viewfinder, either optical or electronic - although you can get a great electronic one, if you don't mind being soaked for another $450 on top of what you've already shelled out for this expensive but marvelous piece of technology.  Or you can get really hosed by Zeiss, and get an optical viewfinder for another $650 - easily the most overpriced accessory in digital photography.  It isn't the fastest focusing, and it requires you to move closer or farther to get the shot that you want instead of zooming in or out given the fixed focal length lens.  It can be both maddening to struggle with under the wrong circumstances . . .  and at the same time a breeze to use like any other point-and-shoot.  It seems wildly overpriced in some sense (compared to any other compact?), but is a genuine bargain in terms of what you are getting (best current 35mm 2.0 lens, best 24MP FF sensor in tiny package with highly customizable operating system).It's like nothing else really.  Its high ISO performance is equal to anything and I do mean anything out there.  It's capable of taking low noise images at ISO 6400, and with a little bit of cleanup and working in RAW, you can easily salvage fairly high quality pictures at ISO 12,800 with lots of detail and little loss of information due to noise.  This competes with some of the most expensive FF models in terms of low light ability (the Canon 1Dx, 6D, 5DIII, Nikon D4 and D600 - at worst, it is very close to those benchmark systems in terms of low light ability - at best it is equal to any of them).Overall, the camera is something of a walking contradiction in terms in many ways (a full frame compact), and at the same time, it's a camera that's capable of inspiring enormous loyalty and will likely generate a truly cult-like following, while many other people may simply shake their heads at what they see as Sony's foolishness. People will complain about the cost, but it's really a good value and you get what you pay for.Pros:1) Remarkable compactness and portability for such enormous low light capabilities w/full frame sensor - an engineering tour de force in terms of cramming full frame capabilities into a point-and-shoot size and form factor (achievable only with a fixed lens).2) Capable of remarkable detail due to its 24 megapixel full frame sensor with excellent color and dynamic range.  DxO sensor score of 93 (4th highest of any tested camera including some medium format sensors).3) Superb Carl Zeiss 35mm F 2.0 fixed lens that is sharp edge-to-edge (which for FF camera might cost $1200 or so by itself). (F4-f8 offers sharpest pictures edge to edge but f2 is still impressive).  Highest rated 35mm lens available by DxO testing.4) As good high ISO as virtually any full frame camera.5) Intuitive but deep operating system and menu structures, immediately familiar to those coming from Sony Alpha background.  Easy to run as full manual camera (excellent manual control dials for exposure, lens aperture, etc) . . . or put on full AUTO, and all shades in between.  Good aperture priority mode operation (my personal fav).6) Capable of shooting 1080 at 60p and taking good video in low light, and with full IS (image stabilization) but see cons.7) Macro functionality in CZ lens (but see cons). Macro mode works well with built-in flash (not always the case suggesting they paid attention to this issue).8) Customizable buttons and other nice user config operating system features.9) Crop/zoom functionality of x1.4 and x2.0 partially mitigates fixed lens restrictions (equivalent to 50 and 70 mm lens but with obvious loss of resolution).10) High build quality w/ nice magnesium chassis - has very solid feel (it ought to for this much $!).11) Decent flash.12) Nice JPEGs vs. the competition - Sony's stay fairly sharp to 3200 at least, while Nikon and (to a much lesser extent) Canon default JPEGs are losing detail at those ISOs.  Adjustable NR on high ISO images in JPEG - setting to LOW can help to preserve details.13) ISO scale goes all the way down to 50 and all the way up to 25,600 (ISO 50 is useful in bright light to get super clean noise free images).14) More standard ISO hot shoe (but see cons) - can be adapted to older Sony flashes with neat accessory from Sony.  Older flashes then work flawlessly.15) Many excellent shooting modes, including fascinating watercolor and illustration modes for some really amazing posters (part of Sony's firmware).16) Much better than average AUTO WB.  With most cameras, leaving WB on auto is invitation to some funky pictures.  Sony is able to get this close to 'spot on' more than almost anybody in their recent operating systems.17) Noise at high ISO is really almost film-like.Cons:1) Price. Decent value for the money, but still costly.2) Fixed focal length lens means extra work to get the shot properly framed - and forget about shooting subjects at a distance.3) Problems with focus lock in low light - mostly a standard contrast detection focus issue (but for example OM5 does better job). Fixable in firmware updates?  Can take a long time to acquire focus, missing key moments. Slow focus even in good light.4) Blinding auto-focus assist lamp.  At nighttime light levels, where autofocus really struggles, almost as bad as flash.  Without it (can be defeated), forget about focus in low light. Problems 3/4 underscore that Sony hasn't really figured out contrast detection autofocus on this sensor.5) Possibility of semi-planned obsolescence, as Sony may release a zoom lens version sometime in the next year or two (would require another set of engineering breakthroughs to get FF zoom lens down in size).6) Disappointing that Sony did not include an electronic viewfinder as either standard equipment at this price, or at a discount.7) Macro mode won't get closer than about 8 inches.8) No IS for stills - given that this is always sensor-based in Sony systems, not sure why omitted (hi ISO performance plus 35mm focal length?). Would still potentially give two stops advantage - not trivial even with great ISO performance.9) Sony STILL hasn't made viewing photos and videos in any kind of alternating fashion easy - must surf menus or shoot video to get easy viewing access to videos on card.10) Poor battery life.  Must carry two batteries for any extended shooting.11) Lens zoom and crop functionality not available if shooting in RAW.12) Flash has really quite modest output and no bounce functionality.13) Can't use both optional viewfinder and external flash at the same time.14) Poor thumb grip with not enough contour - not easy to hold onto the camera with one hand.  Optional thumb grip goes for $250?15) Charging only in-camera, and only with proprietary micro USB interface - can't charge with typical USB charger (if connected to computer that is on and camera detects an active data line). What is the logic of that?  Absolutely bizarre.16) Accessories cost?  $250 for a decent case?  $250 for better (add-on) thumb grip? $650 for a simple OPTICAL viewfinder - you're kidding right?17) Disappointing video quality with both moire and fuzziness (shouldn't have both?) despite impressive specs - realistically lucky if you get 720 lines or so, and with again at best average focus lock.  Video is passable overall w/ excellent color but still disappointing in FF camera where one expects better.18) Auto compensation for vignetting (corner shading) introduces subtle color artifacts.  Baked in to RAW files too, not just JPEG - but this auto correction can be turned off in menu (probably easily fixable in firmware updates?).Having more cons than pros doesn't mean that I don't like/love this camera.  I'm a bit stunned by its capabilities on the one hand, and frustrated with its limitations and very quirky design logic on the other (such as the bizarre charging limitations!?*&^%! that prevent charging with most micro-USB chargers).  On balance, it's obvious that what makes it so remarkable actually locks in some of its limitations.  You simply couldn't get this compact form factor with an EVF and even a 3x zoom lens.  The lens alone would be huge, and this Zeiss lens itself is an engineering marvel, in terms of how small it really is for a FF sensor 2.0 lens.  In the end, it's all about image quality, and here, at least in stills if not in video (which is a bit disappointing frankly - like the A99 video), there is little to complain about.  One also wonders how much the somewhat fuzzy video could be fixed in future firmware - it would appear that the A99 has been saddled with the same weakness, suggesting that Sony hasn't figured out how to get the best video out of this new chip at least not yet.  But if you take this pocketable wonder instead of your huge DSLR and bag of lenses, just because it's so damned convenient, isn't that in the end the strongest endorsement one can make?  I find that I am transitioning away from a very favorite Sony A65 w/a very fine 16-50 2.8 as my default camera, just because this is so easy to carry, and makes the DSLT seem huge and bulky by comparison.I'm still exploring the performance envelope of the RX-1, and will update this review as I go.  Some have commented that this is a Leica 'wannabe'.  But Leica would LOVE to have the image quality of this camera (not really all that close frankly, not even the M9 which was way better than the X1), so perhaps it's really the other way around.  It's a remarkable camera by any standard, and perhaps the most INTERESTING/INTRIGUING camera that has been made in the last 10 years, with the possible exception of the new SLTs made also by Sony.  Suggests that Sony is thinking outside the box, and doing so more creatively than anyone else. 4.5 out of 5 stars - but Amazon doesn't allow such a rating so settling for 4/5.  If they had fixed the (lack of) external charger situation, and provided a cheaper EVF option at purchase, would easily give 5/5.UPDATE April 4th, 2013This camera continues to grow on me.  Its upside is pretty amazing.  I have been able to print out 19x13 prints from ISO 3200 images, and have them be sharp, detailed and with excellent color - something I would have thought impossible two years ago. On the other hand, I am still at times frustrated with the poor focus lock, but am finding ways to work around it.  Have gotten two extra batteries with an external charger to obviate the craziness of the USB charging (Wasabi power - highly recommended for $16) and the EVF, which really makes shooting stills a lot easier.  Pictures are often just superb, even just stock JPEGs.  Most of the time run with high ISO NR set to low, and sharpness at +2 - wouldn't want to do that with a Canon, but with the default JPEGs being rather over-smooth to begin with, this gets the most detail out of the sensor without any sharpness artifacts that I have been able to find so far.  RAW images can be turned into decent large size prints with some work up to ISO 12800 - also something I would have thought impossible several years ago.  I also believe that the default JPEG settings (overly smoothed) are probably a function of Sony compensating for the relatively weak anti-aliasing (otherwise known as a low pass filter).  More and more camera makers are weakening that or leaving it out altogether (like the Nikon D800E and new 7100) chasing the consumer's endless demand for sharpness and resolution.  In any case, I haven't seen any increase in aliasing or moire artifacts at the 2+ sharpening - but don't use for portraits of your wife or girlfriend or they won't be posing for you much longer :-).Movies are still a minor disappointment in terms of resolution, but color and dynamic range are excellent so I am living with the roughly 720p instead of the 1080p I thought I was getting.  Hoping that some of the camera's quirks can be fixed or at least improved with firmware updates - although after consultation with Tim Naff (see his superb review of the A99 on Amazon) I suspect that a simple firmware re-write probably won't be able to fix the fuzzy video, as the problems may lie deeper in Sony's processing of video, as the same video is seen on the A99, and milder versions of the video issues are seen on other product lines.  A real puzzle given Sony's broadcast video resume, which is among the best.Surprised at least a bit that Sony hasn't released firmware 1.1.  I suspect they are probably busy with all the change items.  There have been several blogs devoted to the wish-list for the 1.1 firmware re-write.  Curious how much Sony has been listening.  They know they have a huge hit on their hands.  This camera is going to be a classic. I love the images that it is capable of making if you know how to max out its performance, and it is just so much more convenient than the big 20+ lb bag for the DSLR and three lenses.  It's a keeper.Update June 2013Still no news on the firmware update front.  However Sony did release the RX-1R which drops the anti-aliasing (AA) filter - consistent with an increasing trend in the marketplace to push resolution as much as possible and successful (from a marketing standpoint and sales standpoint anyway) in relationship to the Nikon D800E, and the recently released Nikon 7100, along with several other cameras including a couple of new Pentax models where the AA filter has been removed.  Otherwise the cameras are identical, and after looking at moir\u00e9 vulnerability of the new RX-1R, I think the plain ordinary RX-1 with the AA filter is the smarter choice for almost everybody except for studio photographers or people shooting exclusively nature scenes where small fine repeating patterns rarely exist.  In all honesty, I can't really see that much extra resolution from the RX-1R, as the AA filter was rather weak to begin with (at least IMO) in the original RX-1.  In any case, the camera continues to hum along, working flawlessly and continuing to create superb stills both in JPEG and RAW, except for some problems with lowlight autofocus that I've learned to live with.  It works also superbly with an older Sony flash unit HVL-F42AM which gives it excellent bounce flash.  And unlike on the Sony A65, flash is NEVER overexposed.  The one significant limitation of the camera is the lack of any real capacity to shoot anything at a distance, but for 95% of the shooting that I do, moderate wide-angle along with the 1.4 crop (which yields about a 50 mm view) is adequate.  And for when I need really wide-angle, composite stitching of images also works just fine, even without using Sony's panorama mode which sacrifices too much resolution.  HIGHLY recommended - if you can live with the camera's few major limitations (fixed lens and weak focus lock being the two biggies).Update October 2013Well things have gotten a whole lot more interesting . . . Sony has blown everyone out of the water with the announcement of the A7 and A7R (please don't call them NEX cameras as this will upset Sony's cachet/rebranding strategy) but let's face it, that's what they are, souped-up NEX cameras.  However, on paper, they simply are leagues ahead of anything else at this form factor in terms of potential performance, with the really interesting one being the A7R with its 36 megapixel sensor without an anti-aliasing filter - clearly the basic sensor from the Nikon D800E (which only the hard-core Nikon fan boys ever denied was a Sony sensor).  The reality is that the A7/7R competes with the Sony RX 1 directly, and may have been Sony's notion of how the upgrade path would work for that camera all along.  It's about the same weight, and about the same size even, as long as you have the smaller 35mm lens on the A7, with the same sensor in the A7, and a very similar operating system albeit with a different shutter (way louder on the A7 unfortunately) and better autofocus on the AR7.  The A7 and of course the A7R obviously will have a big advantage that the RX 1 of course can't claim - the option for multiple lenses.  The really interesting one of the proposed 5 new full frame FE lenses is the Zeiss 24-70 F4, which is priced at $1200 (prior generation NEX E lenses are not full frame and will result in severe vignetting unless you select significant image cropping).  The biggest problem with the NEX series was simply mediocre lenses unless you are willing to spend a boatload to get a Zeiss lens, and some believe that even the Zeiss lenses in the E mount system were a step down from their A mount lenses (but I haven't seen enough hard testing data to draw a conclusion on that).  Because of all this, I believe that the Zeiss 24-70 needs to be a virtual homerun in terms of its performance for this system really to take off.  If it is as good as the Alpha mount 24-70 2.8 (a monster lens BTW in terms of both size and price), the A7/7R becomes a viable alternative to the RX 1 and begins to look like a compact pro camera.  I haven't actually shot yet with either model and I'm looking forward to getting my hands on an early release model to really evaluate it.  A major question is whether they have done something to improve the video quality, which was not bad but not great on the alpha 99/RX 1.Here's my parsing of pros and cons of the RX-1 against the new AR7/7R.Pluses of the AR7-7R versus RX-11) interchangeable lenses - far and away its biggest selling point and advantage.2) included OLED electronic viewfinder (extra cost upgrade option on the RX-1).3) slightly cheaper identically equipped (AR7 with 35mm 2.8) $2500 versus $3200 for the RX-1 with Sony's add-on EVF.4) improved auto focus system relative to RX-1 with phase detection on sensor (but A7R stuck with just contrast detection after deleting AA filter).5) significantly better accessory support including a nice battery grip - Sony appears to be positioning this as a viable professional camera and not just something for photography enthusiasts with money to spend.6) significant resolution bump for A7R with identical sensor to Nikon D800E - making it a potential alternative to medium format in a way-smaller form factor (but watch out for moir\u00e9 if you're not shooting exclusively natural scenes). Having that much resolution in this little a package is really a bullet point for Sony.7) No firmware update for the RX-1 in over a year since release!  Does this mean that Sony has already orphaned this fantastic camera, with all their attention on the A7/7r?Pluses of the RX-1 versus the AR7-7R1) a true coat pocket camera versus I don't know what kind of pocket for the AR7?  Without taking the lens off no AR7 is going to fit in even a generous coat pocket (unless it has the 35mm 2.8 which puts it close in size to the RX-1).  But with the 24-70 f4 Zeiss, forget about any pocketability.  Removing lenses frequently obviously exposes the sensor to dust and other potential environmental negatives.2) questionable and frankly disappointing lens systems for NEX camera group up to now means a bit of an uphill push for Sony to get the new FE lenses up to alpha Zeiss/G lens standards. (UPDATE: Testing on the first of the FE full frame Zeiss lenses suggests that the 55m 1.8 lens is exceptionally sharp!)3) even roughly identically equipped, the RX-1 has a faster lens (2.0 versus 2.8). In any case, the lens on the RX-1 is by any measure a screaming homerun and might be the best 35mm lens anyone has made up to this point.4) lighter weight for the RX-1.5) nice little flash on the RX-1, nothing on the AR7-7R. A dedicated flash is going to really add bulk. This is one of my biggest concerns about the A7/7r - I find that the flash on the RX-1 really comes in handy, and provides very consistent exposures.  I have an older Sony HVL-F42AM which I love for bounce flash, but it is large and bulky.6) UPDATE!! - big problems with sensor reflections (or some other type of artifacts) are emerging in the early reviews of the A7, in relation to bright light sources.  See discussion of this on DPReviews Sony Users blog, where you can also find some striking examples of this - other cameras have demonstrated these types of artifacts from time to time, but the A7 and even the A7r show major problems (streetlights, other bright light sources, esp. sun - and this is NOT simple lens flare, which is universal at least to some degree).  In addition, both the A7 and A7r show more dramatic 'sun-star' artifacts than most cameras show.  THESE ARE A BIG DOWNSIDE (at least IMHO)!!  Sony is doing their usual damage control - minimizing, denying, and basically just hoping that the negative press dies out.  Not sure I would buy one of these camaras - as great as they are - until Sony fixes this issue.  If you shoot a lot a night with street scenes and various artificial lights, the sensor reflections on the A7/7r are going to be a potentially major distraction.  Troubling that Sony didn't pick up on this and fix it. On the other hand, early testing suggests that the Zeiss FE lenses (35 2.8, 55 1.8 and 24-70 F4) are just fabulous and every bit as good as the Zeiss lens on the RX-1.  These will allow the A7r to really exploit that fantastic sensor.So aside from the usual trade-offs here of lowered weight and portability versus operational flexibility, lens and other support ecosystem options, what separates the RX-1 from the A7/7r?  Not much.  The interesting thing here is that Sony is clearly going to be competing with themselves given that no one else, well almost no one else excepting Leica whose products are simply out of reach, is making a full frame relatively compact ILC.  It's a real throwdown to the rest of the ILC world and looks positioned to capture most of the high-end of the ILC market. Will be interesting to see what the marketplace does with this.Meanwhile back at the RX-1 ranch, I have to conclude that not even Sony (with the new A7/A7r) can beat the portability of the full frame RX-1 - and neither can anyone else.  My overall conclusion is that if you can live with the limitations of a fixed lens, there is still nothing out there close to this camera right now.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is one amazing Camera and yes, I have it in hand.", "Author": "Steve Huff", "ReviewID": "R3UV8BFKT2P2U8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I review cameras, you may know me you may not. Part one of my review has already been posted on my site and I have to say that if I could give this camera 7 stars I would. The RX1 is a tiny beast of a camera and I have never seen results like this from any full frame sensor 35mm camera under $10k. This gives equal or better than Leica M9 and Zeiss 35 results for a fraction of the cost. Amazing quality even at f/2 and JPEG mode. Some will hate on this and never hold it or even use it just due to the price. But with that,  IMO it is well worth the cost if you want a camera that can fit in your coat pocket and provide some of the most amazing results with an ease that no other camera can give you. The RX1 is the real deal, and my pick for best camera of 2012. Enough said. I just wrote 6000 words on it so I am keeping this short and posting my REAL 5 star review due to the 1 star review below from someone who never touched the camera. My order is in.BTW, Part 2 of my full review is now up on my site.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Giving it 5 stars, but really 4.5 for one reason", "Author": "Eric M. Joyner", "ReviewID": "R2A0DC0M7PFBTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently purchased this camera as I have been searching for quite some time for the ultimate carry-around body.  To provide perspective, I am a photographer that has done some pro work (mainly weddings), but the majority of my time is spent in serious amateur mode.  In addition, 35mm has always been my preferred focal length (enables enough background to give perspective to the subject while not having the subject get lost in the background or requiring the photographer to get uncomfortably close).I have spent the last 2 years evaluating many different camera systems to find something that best meets my needs.  In addition to some travel, I have 2 children (4 and 2) and capturing their lives is of the utmost importance for me.  This means I need something that has fast focus, can be easily carried around, has great imagine quality, shallow DOF, and take great photos indoors (in low light).  In addition, I prefer shooting with a viewfinder so that I can really view the image prior to capture.  Lastly, while I'm no videographer, I ideally would like to have a camera that take really good video (maybe not movie-quality, but much better than typical home movie quality).My evaluation set has been:Nikon D700 (which I had for years with many pro-grade lenses)Olympus E-M5Fuji X100Fuji X-Pro (with all 3 lenses)Sony RX-1 (most recent)Panasonic GH2I have purchased and owned all of those cameras, each for more than a year (i.e. I didn't buy and play for a weekend, then send them back - I really used them actively).  I'll cut to the chase - I have sold every one of those cameras and lenses on eBay in the last 2 weeks except for the Sony, and the E-M5.  However, my day-to-day is now the RX-1.  The only reason I kept the E-M5 was to use the 45 1.8 and the 75 1.8 for longer focal lengths when needed.  The RX-1 is (for the most part) the camera I have been waiting for.Instead of writing a long review, let me explain the cons of the cameras above that caused me to make a different choice.  EVERY SINGLE CAMERA ON THAT LIST HAS ALMOST TOO MANY POSITIVES TO NAME.  I don't want you to think they are poor cameras; they are all fine photographic devices.  A good photographer could make great images with any of them.  So, I'll list why I didn't pick each one and opted for the RX1.  D700 (Rendering is incredible, but body and lenses too big for casual use and in no way pocketable), X100 (very strong with latest firmware, but not as good at high ISO or as shallow DOF as Sony), X-Pro (focusing not quick enough to keep up with kids, and not really pocketable, even though images are great), GH2 (Great video but no Image Stabilization built in (via by body or software) but never impressed by stills).The RX-1 is my choice b/c:- The image quality has the same amazing dynamic range (or better) than D700 with greater resolution- Incredibly sharp 35mm F2 lens- Same shallow DOF as D700 with F2 lens- Incredible high ISO (I can't seem to make 6400 noisy enough to even matter, and have actually used up to 25600 with some reduction and been comfortable)- Relatively pocketable (more on this in a minute)- Video quality that is extremely usable, with IS built in (via software)- Dial-based system much like X100- AF system, while not super fast, is quick enough for use with kids (and the issue isn't so much the focusing speed, which is fine, but the occasionally back and forth lens racking as it tries to lock on to something, which happens even for stationary objects in some cases)But, the RX-1 isn't a slam dunk b/c:- NO VIEWFINDER!  This is my biggest issue with the camera (and why I really give it a 4.5 and not the 5).  A photography machine of this caliber needs a viewfinder.  So then you say, get the hot shoe finder....- The Hot Shoe finder doesn't lock into the hot shoe, and slides in and out with relative ease.  I learned this the hard way today as a LOST the finder in the park - $500 down the DRAIN.  SO FRUSTRATING!  Next time I'll be gaffers taping it to the body somehow.- This depth of the camera makes it a little dense for a jack pocket.  In addition, with the added Hot Shoe finder, it's still pocketable but not easy to get in and out.  Something like an X100 or X100s would be WAY more functional in terms of very quick access.  But, the camera does technically fit in a jacket pocket even with the viewfinder installed.- Focus distance could be better, but flipping to macro mode is well done.  BUT, the camera hunts much more in macro mode, even with direct sunlight.There are other pros (like panorama mode, button placement, and menu system) and cons (like no external charger) but those aren't as critical to me.  What I wrote matters most.Notice in this write-up how I never mentioned price?  Yes, it's expensive.  But, until now I have had to buy multiple cameras to get the mix of situation (outdoor and indoor), portability (small and large), and Media (great stills and great video), but now I can do all of those with just the RX-1.  I'm fine with the price considering that, and that there are technically no other true competitors in the market (i.e. compact body full frame chip).I'm incredibly pleased, and haven't even thought twice about the sale of all of the other cameras.  I anticipate that I will have the RX-1 for awhile, and then will upgrade to an RX-2 which I'm sure will address the little issues I named above.  But, from a portability (manageable), image quality (breath-taking), speed (enough for shooting toddlers, which is what I need), and video (stunning for my needs), this camera is killer.But the Viewfinder situation is STILL STUPID!  :-)Sorry for any typos.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "For Photographers", "Author": "Jules D", "ReviewID": "R394AZYPGN2MGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As one of the three reviewers here so far that actually own the camera I would like to point out that first and foremost I have to say that this is definitely not a camera for hobbyists. Absurdly and with much amusement I have read several complaints here regarding the camera from people that have a) never touched the thing, b) have no intention whatsoever in buying it and c) lack the knowledge or experience in photography that Sony had in mind when developing and releasing this camera, a world's first. Nothing like it has ever existed before.This is a niche product, let me say that again, this is a niche product.- no, it doesn't have an articulated screen.- no, it doesn't automatically upload to facebook via wifi.- no, you don't get a one year subscription to cheezburger or lolcatz.- no, it's not bundled with a \"Sony RX1 for Dummies\"- no, you have to buy the accessories, it's not like that 100 piece tool kit on QVC for $49.99- no, it doesn't have a f1.2 lens (anyone that has seen size of the canon 35mm f1.4 or Canon 85mm f1.2 would immediately understand why Sony went with a f2 lens).- no, you can't change the lens  (Cartier-Bresson shot with one lens his whole life: a 50mm. Well, okay, the rest of us like options but this is not a deal breaker at all for me, 35mm is considered a standard lens on a 35mm camera). The Mamiya 6 was also a fixed lens camera and immensely popular.What it is however, is the world's first full 35mm frame, leaf shutter (can sync at 1/4000s, let's see Canon or Nikon accomplish that) compact camera in the world Considering that the lens would retail for about $2,300 by itself, I'm assuming that Sony is betting that they will make up in volume what they are losing in cost on the body and sensor.I'm a professional photographer and I bought this as a backup to my Canon 5D MKII, my other digital camera is a Phase One 645DF with a P65+ back and the Schneider 55mm & 85mm LS lenses.Having just unboxed my new RX1, I have to say that my first impressions were that it reminded me slightly of my Leica M6 in heft and feel. Also, the slightly rounded edges only supported this sensation. Sony might or might of done this deliberately but I'm sure aren't complaining if the comparison is raised. I've only just started shooting some samples but so far I found the Carl Zeiss lens to be sharper and tonally smoother than my Canon 35mm f1.4L lens, which is pretty impressive to say the least. Highlight blooming is also less.I only shoot RAW and the Sony format of ARW 2.3 will as Steve Huff pointed out stymie a lot of software. So far I have not had any problems opening it Capture One Pro 7.0.1 which is a relief as the Sony image conversion software is extremely poor. I rarely use on camera flash but the RX1's built in flash appeared to me to have better coverage than my previous Sony NEX-7.In my opinion this also is definitely not a pocket camera, it's just too bulky. Again, it's not a deal breaker for me. I bought this purely for when I'm not working and for a backup to my Canon 5D MKII. I've yet to compare the low light capabilities with my 5D but Steve Huff did a great job over on his blog with similar cameras. I have not tried to digital zoom however, haven't touched it. I've always ascribed to Robert Capa's maxim: \"If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough.\"In my opinion the quality of the optics, the size of the sensor and the form factor of the camera will allow anyone using it to produce images that simply will stand out from other compact cameras.Lastly, the second I unbox any camera I immediately put a UV filter on it. I highly recommend B+W filters as you can see here.B+W 49mm XS-Pro Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Nano Coating (010M)**UPDATE**I erroneously stated that Photoshop CS6 camera raw 7.2 can open these files, this is not the case sadly.

My background is I'm a RAW only still image shooter and I dont use fancy cameras.  I have a 5D still and also an Olympus EPL1, both are pretty outdated by comparison to newer cameras.  I was looking for something the size of a micro 4/3 but with the IQ of a full frame, and this is exactly what I'm looking for.I bought this camera in Japan on 11/16 when it came out and after three weeks of shooting I have some very strong opinions about it.  To start, the IQ is fantastic.  Right now Lightroom is unable to handle RAW so I've been shooting JPEG, and they are fantastic.  Ive uploaded numerous photos unedited straight out of the camera JPEG on flikr and people have been amazed at the quality.  Second, the handling of this camera is great.  There is no shutter lag and the shutter is completely silent, making it a fantastic street camera.  This is really the camera I wanted and this does not disappoint.So nothing is perfect and here are my minor gripes:MF can sometimes be difficult without the viewfinder.  I have both, but I prefer just using the LCD screen.  The MF magnifier is very helpful, but sometimes it is annoying and adds a few extra seconds to move around the zoomed spot.  Using the EVF makes it a breeze, but there's something about putting a camera up to your face that makes your subject know you're aiming at him.  Additionally it would be nice if there were hard stops on the lens when focusing.  It would be nice to feel when Ive reached infinity instead of just seeing a chunky bar move across the screen.No threaded lens - so now I have to pony up more cash to Sony for filters.  These accessories are NOT cheap!Bright AF assist lamp - this thing is BRIGHT, almost blindingly bright.  It can be disabled, but then your nighttime AF capability is drastically impaired.  At night I've found myself just leaving the camera in MF mode.Meter - I wish there was a conventional meter when using the EVF to show you how under or overexposed you are, not just a histogram and a live view image.Battery life - I haven't run out yet during a shoot, but I've definitely had it drain down to almost nothing just by shooting a few pics here and there for a few days and playing with menu settings.Overall this is a great camera.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Real review from a Nikon DSLR and Leica M9 user", "Author": "Lars Milano", "ReviewID": "R2IZS09FXI2SW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera doesn't replace a DSLR.  The contrast detect AF is primitive compared to most modern DSLRs, it doesnt have weather sealing for use in harsh environments like pro DSLRS, and you obviously don't have the flexibility of lens interchangeability.  You won't be able to track fast moving subjects like kids or pets as effectively as a DSLR.  You also can't shoot birds, wildlife, or sporting events as effectively due to lack of telephoto even in digital crop mode.  You can't manual focus as effectively mostly because of the lack of a built-in viewfinder.  Blah, blah, blah.  So it all seems very limited on paper... but ironically, I've found it to be more useful than any DSLR or camera I've ever owned, period.  And that is the amazing thing about this camera: it just takes beautiful images and allows you to enjoy the art of photography, with the loveable simplicity and ease of a point-and-shoot, while still retaining the classical manual controls (like aperture and focus rings in the lens barrel) reminiscent of a rangefinder.Yes, you heard me right.  I just referred to this $2800 class-of-its-own technological tour-de-force gem from Sony as a point and shoot!  A point and shoot that doesn't even have a zoom lens.  And I mean that as a complement.  By creating such a niche photographic tool, Sony has also created what I think will be a classic.  Legendary to some, perhaps.  The RX1 is truly something that we have not seen before and while many will balk at the lack of viewfinder, an articulating display, and lens interchangeability, Sony's willingness to go against the grain has actually delivered everything that was promised on paper.  This is a \"point and shoot\" that produces images that truly rivals my D800 with a 35mm f/1.4 Nikkor or any similarly excellent Nikon glass I mount on it.  In some cases it's better.  It makes me want to sell my Leica M9 and my small collection of Leica glass so I can use the funds to buy a car.  The RX1 is that good.I will dispense with all the exhaustive technical details because I'm sure that by now you've already seen countless reviews with pixel peeping examples.  Instead, I will say this: if you're a photography enthusiast that prefers the raw simplicity of a rangefinder and have the willingness to allow a simplified platform improve your photographic and composition skills, this is your camera.  The added benefit is than it will take images that will match or surpass any DSLR available today, including high ISO. It is cutting edge sensor technology without much fluff.  A purist's digital camera if you want to call it that.  A point and shoot that happens to house one of the most advanced full frame sensors ever placed in a consumer camera.  As a Nikon/Leica shooter that has relied on optical viewfinders for years, I've found the lack of a viewfinder a non-issue.  The RX1 is simply a joy to shoot with.

After a few minutes of shooting, I realized it's because I had fallen victim to the hype about cameras that can sometimes make you think that a camera will just, \"Make good pictures.\" I had been anxiously awaiting the chance to use it and expected the first photo to just jump off the screen and knock my socks off! But it didn't. Because it was a snapshot in fluorescent light. Every camera is capable of making good pictures. But you still have to be the one building them.However, when I got to spend a week with it starting a few days later, my impressions were very different. The feel, look, image quality, and ergonomics are absolutely wonderful. In fact, I would put them as close to perfect as any camera I've used, and I have used a lot of them both as a working photographer and camera salesperson. I, like a lot of people, have been searching for a small camera with good image quality for years. I've gone back and forth on little Rollei film cameras, I've strongly considered the NEX-6, RX100, XE-1, S95, etc. But, having shot with a canon full frame SLR for about 4 years, I could never pull the trigger on buying a camera that could not be used professionally (within reason), and would sacrifice some low-light/background blur/image quality. The RX1 (which I accidentally just typed as RX!--a fitting name, haha) finally fills that spot perfectly. It is as small as I would ever imagine a full frame digital camera and lens combo could be. Easily jacket-pocket-sized.The camera is truly wonderful to use. There are so many customizable buttons that I have a button for everything I use, and for the first time since I switched to digital, one of them is not ISO. I leave it on Auto ISO 100-25,600, and I don't even think about it. In color with all NR turned off, the luminance noise is very film-like, though there is some chroma noise (very easily removed in PS). In black and white, ISO 25,600 is genuinely printable at 8x12\" (possibly further, though I hadn't tried).There are small issues, though. For example, the trash can button doesn't do anything while shooting, which is sad, because it would be nice to be able to customize that. But that is the level of issues we're talking about. This camera is a revolution, so I'll spot them a few bugs. Every new Canon and Nikon has issues too, expect those are refreshes of cameras that already exist. This is the only thing like this ever. So I'll deal.If you are still reading this, you are likely someone who is seriously considering the camera. I have two final things to say to you:1. If you are unsure, rent it. There is a very reputable site where one can rent lenses... or cameras. Try it out. I have had it for a week, and I am actually waiting for an email back from the rental place to see if I can keep it longer. I've never loved shooting a camera more than this. Canon 6D, Nikon D600, D800 -- they are lovely cameras that do their jobs very effectively. But if I didn't shoot weddings, and I just wanted one camera, this would certainly be it. I just shoot all the time with it. But, if you want to take a portrait from 6 ft away, this isn't the camera. It is a 35mm, and that's just fine -- your phone doesn't zoom either, but it never stops you from taking pictures with it.2. You have also, no doubt, read the review done by the Internet's most prolific and pompous camera \"expert\" and \"artist.\" Please ignore him. He doesn't like it because \"the colors are too green\" and he can't figure out how to add tint to WB (press right when you're on WB...), and also that on AUTO the camera chooses f/4 instead of f/2.This can also easily be fixed by SHOOTING IN APERTURE PRIORITY. Meanwhile, there is nothing else like this camera in the world! It is a pleasure to use, and constantly gives me exactly what I want. It is a pocketable full frame camera with a Zeiss 35mm f/2 lens that is JUST AS SHARP at f/2 as it is at f/5.6, and is usable at every ISO, for what is normally just the price of a much bigger camera.This camera is incredible. Get it in your hands for a few days and you'll understand.

The jpg files that come out of it, without editing are so delicious that it pretty much turns everyday snapshots into magic.1) The cost is totally justified because of how great the images come out even before editing.  The amount of flexibility in playing around with whats in focus on the full frame sensor, through this f 2.0 lens with crystal sharp clarity makes it worth it.  The perfect ergonomics, and still fast shooting speed, and unequaled low light performance makes it worth it. The fact that its so small and light and can feasibly be carried everywhere with you at any time, makes it worth it.2) for the first week, yes.  After a week, no. You have to learn to move yourself around a little bit.  If you can't take 2 steps forward or 2 steps backward, then move to a different angle. Your compositions will improve by learning this.  Need to zoom in? no problem - this camera has digital zoom and you can zoom 200%. because its 24 mpx, its no problem at all.  Need to take a huge landscape and wish you had a 10 mm wideangle on a full frame body? use panoramic mode and get the job done. for the 99% of pictures I take, with family and friends, doing cool things and living life? 35mm is perfect. Its not portrait photography and its not landscapes.  Its portraits IN landscapes.3)  Auto-focus speed.  I really think the complaints about this are ridiculous and stupid. In normal lighting, it is just as fast as my canon 5d.  No thought need enter your mind about how long will the camera take to focus.  You compose the pic, and push the button and it takes the picture.  In VERY low light, like a dark restaurant with 1 candle in it, it will hunt for 0.5-1.5 seconds, and then lock on.  I would like to remind those people, who are NOT taking life changing pictures 8 times every second of every day, that you can probably afford to hold the camera up for 1 second and let it lock on to the target.  I'd also like to remind those people who don't have even 1 extra second, about what they are getting in exchange for that 1 second - they got to go out for the night carrying a tiny camera in their palm, which can shoot dslr quality photos,  instead of a 5 pound DSLR rig with a 10 inch lens sticking out.  For those whose life depends on trying to freeze frame a golf ball coming off  the driver head in 1/10000 sec, at midnight, then yes, this is the wrong camera for you. While I'm on the issue of low light, try taking a picture of people in normal city lighting at night at 6400 iso and be amazed at how the picture glows and feel vibrant and alive.4) in the market of small size cameras with full frame sensors and top quality lenses, well this camera has exactly Zero competitors.  This is the only camera of its kind.5) I haven't felt the lack of a view finder (not because I don't know how to use one).  I keep the screen brightness at max, and the screen is extremely high quality.  I can see it clearly in bright daylight.  I bought the accessory optical view finder and returned it.  It doesn't really add that much.  For some people it may and for them the OVF and EVF accessory is always available to purchase and if you have the disposable income to spend 2800$ on a camera, you can come up with the 600$ more for the view finder if for some reason you just can't live without the view finder.Some people also complained about the battery not having an external charger.  I like the fact because the premise of this camera is small and compact.  it charges with a micro USB charger, which all android phones also charge through.  You can use the same charger for your phone and your camera. Absolute worst come to worst, drop 40$ and buy yourself a spare battery and external charger.Summary: Amazon takes returns no questions asked for 30 days.  Buy it, and you'll see what I'm talking about.Good Luck, and I hope it helps!Note: I tried the sony wide angle converter, and fish eye lens on here.  They DO fit on, but the images are unusable.

Now my RX100 and NEX-6 have a big brother. I tend to do a lot of low light stuff and, since there are many excellent reviews here already on general characteristics of the RX1, I thought I would focus (no pun intended) on the low light performance. Things like a single shaded 15 watt lamp across a 12 foot room in an otherwise dark room revealed a wealth of detail on wall plaster, etc. A crop of the darkest areas throughout the scene revealed no noticeable noise to my eyes. Likewise with night scenes one to two hours before sunrise with no street lights except for a few distant gas lamps in a quaint park ... No noise, rich blacks but still plenty of detail in the darkest areas, colors were dead on as long as i did not have competing wavelenghts present ... ie. 6,000K (flourescent store window lights) and 2,800-3,200K (incandescent lights) present in the same area. I chalk this incredible low noise performance up to the RX1's superior upper ISO processing. Here is a very telling link that compares crops of the RX1 to the A99, NEX-7, D600, D800 and the Canon 5D Mark III. In nearly 70 to 80 percent of the comparisons for resolution and color accuracy the RX1 either met or bested the other cameras. That is huge if you think about it ... A Mark III work-alike in a small block of magnesium alloy! Amazing. The link I am refering to is at the imaging-resource site under their RX1 preview.The key thing here is that this lens and sensor were made specifically and precisely for each other. This is true for those items and the processor as well. And that is very important. These are not just a collection of parts. They were MATCHED in function and performance to each other. The obvious benefit in that approach is that the performance can exceed a \"sum of the parts\" approach. No, you cannot change out lenses, but that is the very characteristic that gives the RX1 its uncompromised image quality and a slight advantage over some of todays best dslrs in ISO spanning image quality.Now onto the low light focusing. I'm just a hack, and forgive me if this is common knowledge, but here's what I found ... In low light auto focusing, my RX1 is rougly equivalent to my RX100 which is a champ. Does that mean that low light focusing  is comparably fast to bright light focusing? No, I don't know of too many cameras that do not suffer some  in focusing speed as the light goes down. But I still am not seeing any auto focus attempts that take longer than a half to three-quarters of a second. I suspect that is because I always seek edges to center focus on ... vertical or horizontal ... But always edges. The RX1 does not give us phase detect focusing like my NEX-6 (on certain lenses) ... We only have contrast detect to auto focus with.  It's okay to grab a center focus on a contrast area then recompose but we gotta have some contrast in a small area to get it. Otherwise we're stuck with manual focus and peaking ... but peaking also needs at least some semblance of an edge. So by looking for a few pixels in the scene that have some contrast and grabbing focus on them, I simply don't have the low light focus issues I read about. It's a work around but it's quick.At any rate, I am very happy with this camera. If you check out the link I referenced above, you can see the exact differences in crops from the RX1 and the current leading dslrs ... at escalating ISOs. Very revealing just how mighty this little guy is. Words cannot express what those image comparisons show through the ISO range. After seeing those, I personally did not mind so much that a viewfinder was not included, etc. Besides the LCD on the RX1 uses the same \"White Magic\" high contrast technology as the RX100, and I have never had a problem in sunlight seeing that display clearly. Not saying this is adequate for everyone, but it's enough for me. I also would prefer an EVF like my NEX-6, but I will do what I have to do in order to get the images the RX1 produces. On build quality, the RX1 is built like a tank. I have been a design engineer for products like these most of my life, and I can tell they threw away all the restrictions when they designed this unit and selected its materials. But the thing that sealed it for me was the image comparisons with those reigning champion dslrs on the imaging-resources review.  It's still like I'm in a dream ... How is it possible that that small chunk of metal can get better IQ than those cameras at so many ISOs. This is one of those rare buys where I think I am only going to feel better about this as time goes by. I am a street photographer so the permanently affixed f2 is not a problem for me .... I just use my Nike sneakers \"zoom control\" to get the shot I'm after. Very pleased with this camera. It may not have every box checked for your list, but if a combination of superb image quality, uncompromised engineering and portability are important to you then it doesn't get better than this at present. I could wait for a future interchangeable lens model, but I actually like the fact that this design forces me to think differently about what I \"need\" for a shot. With its capabilities, small size, no worries about setup for shots, etc I am ready for most moments in time to capture them. I wanted something that literally feels like an extension of my hand.

If I had it to over again, I would not buy it.I generally like the camera. Its small and light, and fairly efficient. It turns on quickly and captures images quickly. Its a great camera to carry daily and capture the things you would miss. The image quality is very good.For reference, I normally use/used Nikon D800, D700, D3s, Hasselblad H3d-31, H4d-40, Phaseone P65+. Compared to those the focus is much slower but the weight is much less. I also have a Canon G11 for a pocket camera - which is paintfully slow to record each image. So the Sony is a pretty ideal 'every day carry camera', albeit with a wide angle view on everything.I read the blog reviews by Steve Huff, Lloyd Chambers, and Ken Rockwell. I pretty much agree with all of them, but feel Steve loves the camera, the other two liked it but ultimately rejected it. All point out the good image quality, but Ken pointed out there is a slight greenish tint - I agree but its somewhat subtle and can be compensated for in lightroom but colors still don't look quite right. Lloyd felt the camera didn't have a comfortable ease of use even after weeks of usage. I don't think its too bad, but there is a huge ton of menu options to wade through. I think everyone agrees that it can be slow to focus, but generally I don't think its too bad - it might take 5 seconds to rack back and forth to get the focus at twilight or in darker situations. The focus peaking feature is very helpful and I wish professional cameras had this - but still some of my images were not sharp using this, so not sure what is up with that.There are several things very significantly negative about this camera in addition to those issues. First of all its fragile. I dropped a D700 3 feet onto concrete and there was no damage at all. The sony was around my neck on a very short neck strap and as I bent over to pick something up, it swung left to right, knocked something, and the glass over the LCD shattered. I was unhappy about that, but it worked fine and thought I would just live with it. Then two weeks later the focus system went out - and it was impossible to focus using auto focus or manual focus.The second problem is that Sony is unreasonable. I took the camera to a Sony store and they said the focus problem was clearly a warranty issue since the camera was only 3 months old. However, the Sony repair center said that the entire warranty was void. They presented me with a bill for $950 to repair both the focus problem and the cracked glass.By comparison, I have had $3000-$5000 Nikon's repaired by Nikon for never more than $225. I have had two $12,000 used Hasselblad's repaired by Hasselblad for about $450 each. I have personally put a Schott glass screen cover on a Nikon D3s for $20 and there were instructions for removing it by heating it up to losen the glue. And in years of photography I have never seen a glass screen crack or break before this despite all kinds of abuse in the field. So $950 for a repair on a new camera point and shoot is just out of control. Its more than the price of a new Sony Nex-6 or Nex-7 (and keep in mind the problems were not with the expensive RX-1 sensor - they were with mundane parts of the camera). They also refused to fix just the focus problem without fixing the cracked glass. Essentially they had a set of rules that were all to their benefit and I had no options at all. So this camera has now cost me $3500 for the camera alone. It might cost me more if I buy hazard insurance, or a heavy duty leave-on case that takes away from the qualities of being small and light.A third negative is that Sony charges astronomical fees for every accessory with this camera. Want a charger for your battery? Thats a fee. You want a lens shade for the lens, $200. You want a view finder, $450. Everything about this camera is out of control in price. The feeling I have, is that this camera is geared toward rich people with big pockets, and Sony is out to fleece them as much as possible - as evidenced by the out of control accessory prices and out of this world repair costs - and how easily they voided their warranty.I am nervous to use this camera now that I see how easily it breaks. I also read another reviewer who mentioned the lack of weather sealing. We know the focus system is subpar. Yes, it has the same size sensor as the $1800 Nikon D600, but why exactly is this simple camera with a lack of pro features so expensive?I would also say that dealing with Sony's support staff was no piece of cake. I spent over 4 hours on the phone over 10 days - either on hold or shuffled off to another person. A supervisor promised to ask an engineer if the cracked glass was related to the focus problems that developed later, and would call back in \"an hour\" - that hour turned out to be 10 days. I have had much better experiences with Nikon and Hasselblad tech departments - getting clear answers with a lack of hold time.If I had it do over again, I would buy a Fuji, and wait a year for another company to come out with a full frame mini.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing!!!

Comparing to my D800, this little beast really packs a punch. ISO 3200 still produces relatively clean images. ISO 6400 show noticeable grain but can easily be remedied with post processing. And this will be obvious if you're pixel peeping. However if you only need a regular size print or plan to upload to FB, then post processing will take care of the excess noise. I honestly have not been able to find the need to push beyond ISO 6400 yet so I may need to update this review in the future.The amount of detail from every shot is just insane. I previously used a Fuji X100s and was impressed with that but the details produced by the RX1r is even more impressive. The 24 MP full frame sensor without the AA filter really makes a difference. My D800 produces tons of details but that's expected because of the 36 MP sensor. So considering that this is 12 MP less, the amount of detail with every shot is still worth mentioning.Also, the reviews about the camera hunting in low light is noticeable, but comparing that to the X100s, I feel that this camera is faster. I have not had issues regarding misfocus so far, and that's in my dimly lit room. It's just slow when there is minimal light source but I found that it was still able to lock on the subject. With a generous light source it will lock on fast. I have read of reviews saying that the RX1/RX1r is not for those quick candid moments... and to some extent it may not be, but if you know how and when to anticipate the shot, these moments are still possible to capture.My main purpose for this camera is for street photography. I'm just busy with work right now but I plan on going around to use this beast one of these days and see how it performs out there. I'm still deciding between the EVF vs. OVF because I always find myself looking for a viewfinder... something that I truly miss from my X100s. I'm used to an OVF and even while using the X100s, I stuck with the OVF and just adjusted for parallax errors. I'm not too excited about lag although I heard that the EVF for the RX1/RX1r works real well. Maybe in the future Sony will consider adding a viewfinder to the next model.I also got used to the thumbs up grip before so this is something that is definitely killing me right now. I guess if I push through with the OVF (Zeiss vs. Voigtlander???) then maybe I could get Match Technical's CSEP-2, which is a more reasonable alternative than Sony's version. I only wish that they (Sony or any 3rd party company) would make a thumbs up grip with a functional hot shoe so that the EVF could still work. Oh well...I know I have a few comments about the camera but after weighing all the good vs bad points, I still think that the RX1r is a great product. Yes it is expensive, but you really get what you pay for. Full frame + 35 mm Zeiss + small form factor = a product worth $2800 to me. Some might disagree, but this is why I initially said this camera is not for everyone.Me... I'm really happy about mine!UPDATE (8/10/2013):Still amazed by this beast! I tried comparing this with my D800 side by side. Here are 2 shots that I took a while ago... The 1st one using the D800, the 2nd with the RX1r. I was trying to get a good match between the 2. Shots were taken in my bathroom, trying to focus on the upper right corner of the metallic object with mesh (don't know what to call it). I chose this object to test just how good the AF really is since I was thinking that there is a possibility that it might focus behind the mesh (perfumes, boxes, etc). I was also trying to push both cameras to the limit to check how they handle noise. The door to my right side is slightly open to allow just enough light. Both cameras were set to matrix metering and both were 1 stop below 0 (meaning -1).For the D800, I used the Nikon 24-70 mm 2.8 lens (which everyone knows to be a brilliant lens) to try and even out the playing field.Settings: ISO 6400, f/2.8, 1/60 sec, 35 mm, TRIPOD mounted.flickr.com/photos/rex360hype/9481529474/sizes/k/in/photostream/For the RX1r, similar settings were used.Settings: ISO 6400, f/2.8, 1/60 sec, 35 mm (duh), HANDHELD!!!flickr.com/photos/rex360hype/9478731171/sizes/k/in/photostream/Now... Call me crazy... And I know that I don't have the sharpest eye but the RX1r was shot handheld... And the details were still crisper than the D800. Although, I do have to point out that the D800 has an AA filter while the RX1r does not. In terms of noise, the D800 (I think) is a tad bit cleaner... But only a small amount... Oh BTW, the D800 hunted under this lighting condition... As in H-U-N-T-E-D... I almost got pissed because it kept focusing on the perfume in the background. To the point that I decided to focus on the upper right corner of the object just to have a \"thicker\" subject. Whereas the RX1r just locked on like instantly. Well to be honest, it also hunted a little bit... But comparing to the D800, it just smoked the thing! I was surprised... I know that the RX1r hunts in low light, but to lock on faster that the D800 (which was tripod mounted) was just absurd.I think I just found a new level of respect for Sony! Brilliant job! I really wasn't expecting that... SO... YES... I am really really happy!!! :)PS - If you guys shoot RAW, you will need to use Lightroom 5. RX1 is supported by LR4 but RX1r needs LR5. I found out the hard way... Bought the RX1r, shot RAW, tried to import and edit at LR4 but then had to update to LR5, then had to update my OS since LR5 requires at least OS X 10.7. A lot of work, updating, and shelling out more cash...

I bought the first revolutionary digital camera ever in 2007, the Nikon D3 12mpx and shot up to 25600 ISO. Fast forward to 2013, and I bought the second revolutionary camera, the Sony DSC-RX1!!! It's all that and a bag of chips!!!In between 2007 to 2013, I dropped about $30K on DSLR stuff. Then, I realized one day that I'm not paparazzi trying to get a close up shot of Jennifer Aniston in a thong, and I don't shoot F-1's races at 250 mph. So, in one fell swoop, I sold off ALL of my DSLR gear and bought the Leica M9-P and gathered up some M lenses (the Lux 35 and 50 ASPH, and the Cron 90). Happily on my way to complete freedom and bliss with a preorder in for the M type 240, until Sony released the RX1!!! I couldn't see dropping $3K for a P&S; from Sony, to boot, who has had all sorts of QC problems with their consumer electronics. But this was different. For one, it was made in Japan, not elsewhere in Asia. Second, I read just about every review I could read or watch on the Internet, and talked to the guys at B&H;, Adorama, etc. In the end, I felt this was too much to pass up, so I bit at the chance when I could get a discount on this bad boy.This camera does NOT limit me. It liberates me. I can say with 100% confidence that there is no camera that can best this beast for image IQ, at any ISO in its range!!! And I can fit it into my winter coat pocket!!! Now, I don't fall in love easily and when I do, I don't have blinders on. Yes, its accessories are ridiculous in price ... a hood for $180 made in Japan? Why? The EVF is hideous on top of the camera and $450 also made in Japan? The AF is sluggish compared to the OM-D E-M5 but fast compared to my Leica M9-P (it's a joke). I used the Fujifilm X-Pro1 with the updated FW and the RX1 is faster IMHO. The colors are FLAT and nowhere near my Leica, but I have to tweak my Leica's colors too, which is why I shoot in RAW and adjust later. I also wished that Sony would better implement the focus peaking for normal mode, not just magnified mode, but that may be fixable in a FW update. All this bad, yet let me say this again ... there is NO CAMERA that exists that can best the image IQ from this little (just bigger than) P&S; camera. Combined with the fixed Zeiss lens with 2.0 aperture, this is a GEM!!! It is REVOLUTIONARY as much today as the D3 was in 2007!!! I am liberated from thinking about whether I have the right equipment for the situation. I just take my RX1 and go and it FORCES me to frame my picture. It forces me to reconfigure the image in my head, and consider the picture before I just ham handed press the COMPLETELY SILENT shutter. And the fact that you can customize the D-pad, well that just keeps me out of Sony's messed up menu layout but is genius!!! Is my Leica M type 240 still en route to me??? YES YES YES. Do I now have an ample lieutenant on hand in the RX1??? ABSOLUTELY YES!!!In my mind, there is ONLY ONE OPEN QUESTION and that is whether Sony can deliver on QC. If it's built as well as it seems holding it in one hand, then this is a DIAMOND. DO NOT dismiss this camera until you use it ... I also thought it would go back but it's here to stay for good!!! Now, when I travel, I drop my Leica M9-P with the 90 Cron (big lens for Leica M lenses) and yes, the RX1 or as I now affectionately refer to it as my little wonder!!! 35mm f2.0 Zeiss with a ridiculously good sensor, and 90mm f2.0 Cron is TOTAL FREEDOM. Yes, CaNikon can keep their hundreds of pounds of gear!!!

It also has one of the best (if not the best) 35mm FF lenses of all time.  They provide a one-two punch capable of producing the best photography (from a technical perspective) ever, to date.  Of course, ultimately it is the photographer that makes a photo.  A great photographer can make a great photo with a camera phone.  A rookie photographer surely can take thousands of crappy photos with this camera.The build quality is exceptional.  Basically all is magnesium, rubber or glass, except for the battery door and plug input door, which are plastic.  It feels like a brick, which is good to help stabilize the hold.  It has no image stabilization, but most lenses of 35mm or shorter do not.  The P and A buttons typically settle on 1/80 shutter speed.  Generally that is good enough.  However there is no minimum shutter speed setting.  The work-around is to work in M mode, set shutter speed to 1/100 or 1/125 or more and leave on Auto ISO and then set the aperture ring (which is on the lens) to whatever you want to compose the picture.  The camera has amazing ISO noise control up to the default 6400 ISO so this manual mode technique can be quite effective most of the time except in bright light, when you have to be a bit more active controlling the shutter speed dial.  The MF, AF and DMF (AF w/ MF override when shutter release is half depressed) knob is on the front of the camera.  PASM and Exposure Correction knobs are on top.  Shutter dial is on the back up top + a bunch of programmable buttons and thumb dial are on back.  Enormous amount of customization is possible.The menu is quite intuitive and is modeled after that of the Sony Alpha DSLRs.  The LCD is quite bright with very high resolution.  Battery life is so-so, generally allowing 150 - 200 images between charges.  It also has a pop up flash.  However, due to the bright lens and great noise handling characteristics at high ISO, the flash may rarely be needed. The RAW files produced are exceptional providing magnificent Dynamic Range.  There is tremendous resolution from the 24.3MP sensor... and combine that, once again, with that beautiful extremely sharp lens with creamy bokeh and amazing images can be produced.The RX1 fits a very specific need... someone that uses and appreciates the 35mm Full Frame focal length, is seeking incredible Image Quality in a very small form factor.  If you are not a real photo enthusiast you will find the very short depth of field (at f/2) a challenge to focus.  This camera has CDAF technology like most mirrorless cameras.  The shallow DOF further exposes the limitations of CDAF for auto-focusing if the subject is not fairly still.  If you are aware of this fact before buying, it is a camera limitation you learn to work with.  All cameras have limitations.  The other obvious limitation is it is a fixed lens.  If you want an amazing IQ small camera with a 35mm focal length because you either want it on you most of the time or you travel a lot... or you just love photographing with 35mm on non-active subjects... and if you do indoor photography a lot and need a bright lens with a camera sensor that has amazing noise handling, the RX1 may be the camera for you.  It is a very unique type of camera and has the potential to be a classic.  It also has the potential to hold its value for a long time.  \"Potential\" does not mean \"definitely\"If you think you are buying an amazing point and shoot Cybershot to photograph your young children DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.  The auto-focus will disappoint unless you know you have the skill to photograph young children with manual focus (which, by the way, while the lens is focus by wire, it is smooth and buttery with just the right resistance on the RX1).The RX1 is 3 thumbs up if you are the right individual with the right unique needs.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "The camera we have all been waiting for (almost perfection)", "Author": "Scott B.

The only thing close to this camera is the legendary Leica M rangefinder. I have been shooting the RX1 for a few days and am completely blown away with the results. I have also shot w/ a Leica M9 & X1, Fuji X100 & Nikon d700. This camera very well may be the best of the bunch. The combination of size, build quality and amazing glass+full frame sensor is quite an accomplishment for Sony.So why not 5 stars? If I have to nitpick, there are 3 things that kinda bug me. These cons would NOT prevent me from buying this camera.1. Lack of a viewfinder. Although it would add bulk, a built in viewfinder is a no brainer for this camera. Thankfully Sony's solution seems doable - an electronic hot shoe viewfinder. Mine is on order.2. DSLR and \"Cybershot\" BS extra stuff, menu clutter etc. I wish Sony would have looked at the Fuji X100 or the Leica X1/X2 regarding simplicity of controls. If only it had a shutter dial in lieu of the DSLR-like PASM-123 dial. Also aperture priority mode should be activated by a turn of the aperture ring. Keep it simple Sony!3. Auto-focus hunts a little in low light. Better than most cameras in it's class, but could be better.All 3 of these things can be overcome and should not prevent you from considering this outstanding camera.EDIT - Also would like to add that this camera does not have a minimum shutter speed setting for when shooting in Aperture Priority/P/Auto modes. This really needs to be addressed by Sony in a firmware update.EDIT 2 - Considering I love this camera, which I do, I reconsidered my 4 star rating (which Amazon classifies as \"like\"). The cons don't justify the dropping it to 4. I really wish I could give it a 4.5, but 5 will do. Still wish Sony would address some of these issues with a firmware update.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding travel camera", "Author": "Noirist", "ReviewID": "RP3MHPJUQNNCP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used my Sony DSC-RX1 for over a week now, and taken nearly a thousand pictures. In a nutshell, the RX1 is like the Fuji X100 with better image quality and without the insufferable performance problems. The RX1 has superior image quality and good performance, but it lacks the magic of the X100 because it's controls are awkward and it has the compromised ergonomics of a point-and-shoot.The X100 has great controls - a lens aperture ring with an \"A\" setting for automatic and a top shutter speed dial with an \"A\" setting for automatic. So no need for a shooting mode dial to choose between program mode, shutter priority, aperture priority, or full manual. In most situations, you can keep your left hand on the lens aperture ring and your right thumb on the top shutter speed dial and never need to take your eyes off your subject.The RX1 has awkward controls. There's a lens aperture ring but no dedicated shutter speed dial. Instead, there's a plastic wheel that you can use to change the shutter speed with your thumb but you have to look at the screen to see what shutter speed you're at. And it has a very awkward mode dial, that lets you choose program/shutter/aperture/manual for stills, but these choices have no effect on movies. So if you want to switch operating modes in movies, you have to use the mode dial to set the camera to movie mode, and then access the menu to choose your shooting mode for movies. There are many examples like that where the camera makes you hit a few more buttons, turn a few more dials, or navigate a few more menus that you really should have to. Let's say you're shooting a static scene in aperture priority mode f5.6 and now the scene has become dynamic so you want to set the shutter speed to 1/125 to avoid motion blur but don't want the ISO to get out of hand. With the X100, you could make that adjustment without repositioning your hands or taking your eyes off your composition. On the RX1, you have to move your hands multiple times and take your eyes off your composition to look at the controls. First you have to change the mode dial from aperture priority to shutter priority with your thumb and finger and then you have adjust your shutter speed with your thumb while looking at the LCD. It's slow and awkward and takes you away from the scene. I'd give the RX1 5 stars if it had a built-in EVF and the controls of the Fuji X100.In exchange for the awkward controls, you get outstanding image quality and excellent performance. The RX1 contrast-detect autofocus is reasonably fast and accurate even in lowish light. (It's not as fast to choose autofocus points or achieve focus as the Panasonic micro 43rds cameras, but it is much faster than the X100 and certainly fast enough for most uses.) Autofocus tracking is easy to engage and works very well for focus-and-recompose. Manual focus is workable. The rear display has no noticeable lag so you can time your shots. The continuous burst mode is excellent. And best of all, unlike the X100, the camera continues to operate even when it is saving images! So, unlike the X100, you can easily use the RX1 to get excellent pictures of both static and dynamic scenes. Bottom line - I think performance problems render the X100 nearly unusable while the RX1 is entirely useable despite its ergonomic flaws.Do not get this camera for it's video. The specs are impressive (1080p60 at 28Mbps for action or 1080p24 at 24Mbps for cinema) but the measured resolution is clearly less than my Nikon D4, my hacked Panasonic GH1, and my Panasonic TM700 camcorder. The 1080p24 footage from the GH1 only measures 630 lines, and I'd be surprised if the RX1 video exceeds 480 lines of measured resolution (ie., standard definition). The footage is prone to moire, so stay away from patterns. You can use the RX1 movies for close ups of people talking but for anything else you would be better served by a camcorder.The RX1 is expensive and I don't think it is a good value. For the same cost, you can likely get as good pictures with the Nikon D600 (same sensor) and the outstanding new Sigma A 35mm f1.4 lens. You'd get more flexibility with the Nikon D600 because you can change lenses for different situations but the RX1 is significantly more compact and nearly silent in operation due to its leaf shutter. The RX1 is smaller and lighter than the Sigma 35mm f1.4 lens alone! So if you already have a full-frame camera, then the RX1 has something to offer. Otherwise, I'd recommend you get a full-frame DSLR first.Bottom line: the Sony RX1 is small and quiet and ideally suited as a travel camera. It can take outstanding pictures. I'm keeping mine.Update: I've had my RX1 for four months now and wanted to pass on some advice to other RX1 owners. The RX1 lens cap is heavy and does not attach firmly to the camera. Previous to owning the RX1, I'd never lost a lens cap in my life, literally never. Yet within a week, the RX1 lens cap had been dislodged from the camera never to be found again. Sony does not yet sell a replacement. So my first bit of advice is to recommend that you purchase a cheap plastic center-pinch 49mm lens cap along with your RX1, and use that instead of the OEM lens cap. My second bit of advice is to purchase a lens hood to protect the end of the lens. You can get the official Sony LHP1 bayonet-mount lens hood for $180 but what's the point of a bayonet mount that doesn't reverse? So you can also purchase a functionally equivalent 49mm screw-in lens hood for the RX1 on ebay for $6, which is what I did.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely phenomenal", "Author": "M.

Quite an ambitious upgrade path, and one without any mention of a traditional DSLR. Light, unintimidating, and easily portable are critical factors that I look for in my camera gear, and I've shied away from purchasing any camera that lacked those features. While I love the autofocus performance and sheer amount of accessories for Canon and Nikon, an afternoon spent with a friend's 5DIII and D7000 quickly dissuaded me of buying into the system. They were simply too heavy and bulky for me, not to mention that for some reason, subjects would become hyperaware whenever the lens pointed their way, and they would become stiff and unnatural.I'd continuously changed cameras due to a never ending pursuit of better image quality. I was continually frustrated by low light and high ISO performance, as I take a lot of pictures in those environments. I lean heavily towards taking pictures of friends and families (capturing memories as I like to put it), landscape, artistic, and food photography. I like to view my pictures on a 20 inch monitor and print them out for photo books. The RX1 takes superb photos for my purposes.With the full frame sensor, low light performance is absolutely astounding. I can render sharp details and accurate colors in dim bar environments, and a surprising amount of depth in pitch black night. Low light performance is so good that sometimes I have to dial the exposure down, since the camera portrayed the scene with too much light! Coupled with the Zeiss lens, bokeh is absolutely beautiful. I love shooting wide open and have actually ventured into taking more portrait shots as the camera does such a good job with them. I also had the SEL24F18Z with my C3, and find that the two lenses are similar in terms of sharpness, but with the RX1 a much better sensor and lens combo as a whole. Despite many comments to the contrary, I still find the lens to be sharp at infinity. In fact, I love shooting landscapes even more so now thanks to the level of detail and colors rendered in images. Who says this can't be a landscape camera? :)However, autofocus is a bit lacking in low light. This is one of the few complaints I have about the camera. It slows in low light, and hunts quite a bit in dim bar environments. I do have to experiment more with shutter speed and ISO, instead of simply raising and shooting. But this is a limitation I'm happy to work with and around. Focus in good light is snappy and accurate. When frustrated by the autofocus, I switch a dial to MF. I really like how Sony has implemented manual focus on their cameras. Focus peaking is wonderful, making it so easy to frame a beautiful shot.Speaking of the hardware, this is one of the reasons why the camera is such a joy to use. All knobs and dials are solid and turn stiffly with a satisfying click into place. I've taken to calling my camera the \"little monster\" as the full frame sensor seems to suck in light like a black hole, and it feels so solidly built that it could withstand the end of the world.I shoot JPG only, and I really like the output from this camera. I shoot JPG only because I take way too many photos due to always having the camera with me, and cannot fathom spending more time than I currently do on photo selection and organization. I do engage in a tiny bit of very basic PP, but shoot JPG only. The white balance is dead on accurate, the colors are nicely saturated. I particularly appreciate the various filters that Sony has crammed into the tiny package. All of this combined just makes the entire picture taking process a joy, and a form of art. I also prefer to compose with the screen, as I'm accustomed to this style of shooting. The LCD is truly \"White Magic\", it's one of the best I've seen from any camera. (And it should be, with this price tag!).This camera has really redefined my photography skills. Thanks to its easy manual controls, I am constantly experimenting with S, A, and M modes. I'm much more creative, since aperture, exposure and shutter speed are a mere finger flick away. I really appreciate that I don't have to menu dive to change anything, which was one of the most frustrating points of my old C3. My technique has grown by leaps and bounds in the mere two months that I've had it, and I take it anywhere and everywhere. It's so portable and light for me, even when compared to my C3, that I barely use the camera on my cellphone. I have it with me everywhere I go, always ready for that perfect moment to raise the camera and snap a shot.This camera has been an utter joy to use, and I cannot imagine using anything else. The combination of image quality, portability, subtlety, and versatility are unmatched by any other. Thus, for me, the price is right.

The software also must be downloaded and it isn't great software. You don't' really need their software with iphoto and Photoshop but still, it would have been nice. Since I'm griping I may as well mention the strap. The photos and videos on Sony's website show this really nice leather strap. The real camera comes with a standard nylon strap. The leather one must be bought separately. It's not a huge deal but please give me the product you show me.The justification I used for the purchase was this: I started photography over 40 years ago with a Nikomat FTN and a 50mm 1.4 lens. I loved it and it's the only equipment I owned for years. Then the gadget lust set in and pretty soon I'd have a 30 pound bag full of photo crap. All that junk became too cumbersome to carry around and the simple joy and creativity of shooting was gone. This is a dive into high quality digital but also a return to the simplicity of a basic one-lens rig. I went for the RX1R because I do mostly nature shooting and am in love with fine crisp images.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "cyclobiz", "ReviewID": "R261OZR6OD2SE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been playing with this bad boy for a few days and I'm just blown away, no other way to put it: this camera is very special.Yes, it is expensive but the quality of the pictures you get from a FF camera that almost fits in a jacket pocket is simply phenomenal (and I've used APS-C cams for years).The 35mm Zeiss lens here is exceptional by itself but it is also very carefully matched with an exceptional full frame sensor and the current state of the art digital signal processing back end.The result is a magic blend of analog precision and finesse with massive digital power in the palm of your hand with jaw dropping low light perf and shallow DOF, but w/o the DLSR armada.I've read a lot of skeptical opinions from people who clearly miss the point so let's review them 1 by 1:1- \"no interchangeable lenses on a camera this expensive???\"The fixed lens is a good thing for me, after a few years using NEX cams, I've grown tired of dust cleaning the sensor and carrying heavy lenses. Don't kid yourself, it'll take years to even get close to that level of FF miniaturization and integration with interchangeable lenses.Plus, 1 button press and I have instant macro (almost) or even high quality up-sampling to 50 or 70mm and since I'm shooting 24MP images, I have plenty of room for post cropping easily into 150mm territory.Last but not least, I'm now always using sweep panoramas for wide landscape shots so the bottom line is this is the 1st cam that made me feel I can do w/o big bulky lenses, little to no compromise.2- \"no internal view finder on a camera this expensive???\"I agree it would've been better, however some people prefer OVF, others EVF and if you think an integrated hybrid approach like the X100 would've fitted in that body with a FF sensor and a 35mm lens, you're delusional.So, I'm just waiting for a reasonably priced external EVF and in the meantime, I find that using DMF with focus peaking assist on the (gorgeous) back screen gives surprisingly good results, even in bright daylight.3- \"battery life is average and accessories are way over priced!\"yes but... if you quit whining and do a little searching, you'll find 2 batteries + charger for ~$20 (same as the RX100), lens hood and cap for ~$10 so for me it's really only about that EVF.Last, here's the coolest feature IMO:it has an almost silent, ***0 lag*** leaf shutter and once you get rid of that stupid \"click\" sound they've added by default, you'll be blessed with the amazing experience of taking a picture while holding you breath and focusing.Difficult to describe but, the tactile feedback, the quiet mechanical precision and the immediate display of the shot all contribute to make shooting pictures magical again.Final note: Amazon did a great job and assigned a \"concierge\" to personally make sure the delivery was on time for the holiday.Overall great purchasing experience.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perhaps the greatest camera I've ever used.", "Author": "TurbineSeaplane", "ReviewID": "R3PBZH76YLREF4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For EVER the compromise has been \"take the big DSLR + lenses on the trip\" OR \"get subpar shots with a point & shoot or your phone or something.If you aren't shooting a ton of motion (kids flying around, sports, birds in the distance, etc), this is the only camera you need.TRUE full frame quality from an amazing sensor & Zeiss lens combo.I know.

I'm a designer who enjoys photography as a hobby.. Owned a D90 before the rx1, and was really looking for something more compact. The way I see it, photography is about shooting a LOT, and always having the camera with you no matter where you are is a KEY. This is what led me to consider the mirrorless cameras.I was debating between the new x100s and the RX1. Played with both of them numerous times (actually borrowed my friend's x100 for a day), and ultimately felt that the RX1 was a better camera overall.Now don't get me wrong, the x100 and the x100s are no means bad cameras. I was actually quite surprised by the build quality after trying them.  And they're definitely great cameras for its size, very comparable to the quality of my D90. However, they just did feel like a big improvement over my 4 year old DSLR. Whereas when I tried the RX1 in the store numerous times, every single picture looked amazing, and the quality on every single one blew me away. It almost feels like you can't take a bad picture with this camera.After been using it non stop for the past 3 days, what I said above still holds. The quality of the photos coming from this camera is just unbelievable. Of course, there are some downsides. As people mentioned, the battery life is terrible, so a backup battery is almost required. Although the LCD is great, the lack of view finder is kind of a bummer for the price. On top of it all, of course there's the 3grand price tag.Despite all the flaws (or constraints, as i like to put it), being a User Experience designer, I always evaluated a product or service based on it's true value to the user. In this case, I would give the RX1 a 10/10. It's compact-ness allows me to take it anywhere I want, whenever i want it. Having photography as a hobby, I don't have the time to look for and do research on different lenses for different occasions. The 1 camera 1 lense constraint really solved that problem. I do a lot of portraits and sceneries, which the 35mm is perfect for. The build quality is superb, so nothing really to complain about there.Again, for my need, I think I've really found the perfect camera. FYI, I bought the camera from Sony when they had a promotion that for 2799, it comes with battery charger, extra battery, screen protector, and a 2 year accidental damage warranty. Usually I don't buy warranties but hey, can't complain if its \"free\". On top of that, they had financing options up to 36 months, which really makes this camera more affordable.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbelievably sharp photos.

Not much shooting time as I just got the camera today.I took pictures of differently lit rooms, including a really dark room (think of a movie house) with no light, just dim ambient light, to test the focusing ability.  Did quick comparisons against S NEX7 with 18-55mm kit lens, S NEX6 with 16-50mm kit lens, S RX100, FF XE1 with 18-55mm kit lens, and N D700 (full frame) with 24-75 mm, all set at f/5.6 at their widest angle, except for D700, which was set at 35mm.In a well lit room, here's my observed order of focusing speed (fast to slowest): D700, (NEX6, NEX7, RX100, XE1 - all pretty much the same - no hunting and not far off from D700), and lastly RX1.  Rx1 was the slowest of them, and hunts in brightly lit room - now sure why that is.  It's little brother RX100 did not have issue.In the darkest room I've tested, here is my observed order of focusing speed (fast to slowest): D700, NEX6, NEX7/RX100, RX1, and XE1.  RX1 seemed to focus faster at dim situations (when AF light was lit) than brightly lit room, but still seems slower than RX100.  XE1 was not able to focus most of the time in the darkest room, even though RX1 was able to focus with no or occasional hunting.  RX100 had no hunting issue at all.  Perhaps blue AF light that XE1 emits is the culprit.Shots with X1 at 6400-25,000 ISO for the darkest room:  Pictures were all too dark below 25,000.  At 25000, it was very dim but objects at least were visible, but the IQ was pretty bad.  Frankly, the room was too dark.  In a dim-normally lit room, the pictures shot at ISO 6400-10,000 at f/5.6 IQ was quite good.  IS0 6400 images perhaps are more like ISO 1600 images from NEX6/7 and ISO 2500 from XE1.  In comparison to the same images shot with D700 at iso 6400 and up, my eyes tell me that RX1 wins hand down in image cleanliness and IQ.  D700 is ranked No. 7 (DxOMark) in the low-light ISO category.  Will RX1 topple No. 1 ranked N D3s?  It should be at least on par with No. 2 ranked N D600.I will update as I have more shooting time with RX1.Bottom line, RX1 rocks in the ISO and IQ category.Update 1:  I've downgraded to 4 stars from 5 based on slow/inaccurate autofocus.  In indoor shootings, autofocus misses about 1/5.  Don't know why this camera focuses slower than and is significantly less inaccurate than its little brother RX100.

I bought it to replace my point and shoot (that I had to give to my daughter, to take picture of a new granddaughter).  Good fortune all around.  The build of this camera is somehow both solid as a rock and jewel like.  I usually shoot with large DSLR.  But in a recent urban experience it was not going to be possible to lug a D4 and tripod around.  This fits in a jacket pocket.  It is unobtrusive. The perfect stealth camera.  Nobody suspects you are a pro.  (Ignore that straight line please). The ergonomics took very little to get used to.  The image quality is sensational.  It is equal to my D3X.  I have printed 16x20 with it and no one can tell which camera I shot with.  I'm sure it will hold to 20x30.  Being able to directly manipulate aperture and exposure compensation without going to a menu beats any point and shoot I've tried.Drawbacks:  Well, it is a fixed lens camera.  But I knew that when I bought it.  It was still easier to shoot than my previous zoom compact camera.It is bigger than a shirt pocket point and shoot. It won't fit in a shirt pocket. So there. Fits in a sport coat pocket very well.I'm not used to the lack of viewfinder.  It can be hard to compose in bright sunlight.  I'm so enthused by this little jewel that I have ordered the viewfinder.No battery charger.  You plug the camera into a wall adaptor USB port to charge it.  Maybe that is an advantage but it scares me to plug a camera into the wall. I'm using the optional out of body charger.Unknown:  I don't know the real life battery life yet.

The images that come up on my screen are so razor sharp that it completely annihilates my Nikon D700 DSLR. As a matter of fact, the resolution of the images from the RX1 make the Nikon D700 images look like it came from a point and shoot, ironic isn't it?I was expecting a slight increase in resolution in the RX1, but I certainly wasn't ready for the huge advantage that the Rx1 held over the Nikon D700 in resolution. The high ISO performance WOW! I can shoot all the way up to 12,000 ISO and be confident that the file will hold up in post. The build quality is beautiful!! Every button and dial is tight, solid and purposeful on this camera. Sony wanted to make a statement with the RX1. They wanted to announce to the Nikon/Canon giants that they are here to seduce their market share into a tighter, sexier photographic package, and they might even seduce some of the Leica users into their world.I love the customization options of the buttons. I have the left button assigned to ISO, the right button assigned to Quality, the down button assigned to WB, and the C button assigned to focus modes. This is a hugely customizable camera and one that can adapt to a wide range of user preferences. Bravo Sony!Okay so let's get to the nasty bits of the camera.Sony wanted to make an engineering statement, but they went a little overboard. They sacrificed ergonomics, and a viewfinder just for the sake of showing off the sizable miniaturization of this camera. I have fairly small hands and I find it very awkward to hold the camera. Most of the weight, about 70 percent of it, is built into the beautiful Zeiss lens. The body feels like it's a light weight and feels disproportionately weighted to the lens. Consequently, the camera feels very front heavy and requires quite a bit of squeezing on the grip to feel that it's not going to dive bomb onto the concrete below. I really hope someone comes out with a grip that can negate the disproportionate weight balance of this camera, and simultaneously offer a larger grip area.Where's the Viewfinder? Again, I know that Sony wanted to make this camera as small as possible, but the lack of viewfinder really saddens me. Adding insult to injury, Sony wants to charge $450.00 for an electronic viewfinder that should have been included in the first place. The bigger joke here is that the Zeiss optical viewfinder is selling for $600.00, I seriously see low sales for the optical viewfinder. However, I have to state that shooting with the LCD screen has been okay and I have not really missed any shots because of the lack of a viewfinder.The lens is brilliantly contrasty, renders colors vividly and truly gives punchy results with awesome micro contrast and beautiful Bokeh. However, I feel that the Zeiss lens is always \"cranked to 11\" and lacks some of the subtle tonality rendering nuances of the Leica equivalents. However.... the Leica 35mm Summicron is over 3K and is not as sharp as the one on the Sony, so I will gladly accept this as a fact of life. The Zeiss Lens is so sharp that it can excite aliasing/moire artifacts ;even with the inclusion of an AA filter infront of the camera sensor. I have to wonder how much more detail the camera sensor would capture if Sony decided to forgo the AA filter.Finally, the biggest flaw that I can see with this camera is that there is some distortion present with the 35mm Zeiss Lens. Yes it can be fixed in post production, yes you can select an option in-camera to fix the distortion, but lines and faces still look a bit \"wavy\" in the corners of the image.It may seem that I'm being overly harsh on the camera, but with all the negatives that I have stated, I still LOVE the RX!!!!! There is nothing else like it on the market and it gives me beautiful images fast and easy. The RAW files are flexible and seem to have infinite detail in the shadows begging to be pulled out of the abyss. I just hope that Sony makes future iterations of this camera with better weight distribution, less distortion in the lens and a built-in viewfinder.

In that time I've taken several hundred shots with it. Time for my review.In reading some of the negative reviews it has become apparent many people have the wrong expectations of the RX1. Let's look at what you can expect, and what you can't.What to expect:1. Unmatched image quality. At the end of the day isn't this the most important aspect of any camera? Simply put, the RX1 will give you beautiful images.2. Low light capabilities. I've shot many indoor pics including in a dark restaurant, and have yet to use the flash. How this little camera can produce such stunning images in low light is, to me, one of it's strongest features. Now I understand why Sony chose to not include image stabilization for stills; it doesn't need it. You can always adjust the ISO to get the shutter speed needed for hand-held shots (not to mention the high speed lens). The full frame chip constantly produces low noise images even at relatively high ISO.3. Customizable buttons & dials. This is a great asset when conditions require a quick change of settings.4. Rich colors & creamy bokeh. The people at Zeiss got this lens right. And it's WAY sharp at all apertures.5. First class build quality. Feels very solid & well machined.6. Last, but certainly not least, is portability. No camera is worth anything if you don't have it with you. You'll find yourself grabbing the RX1 at times you most likely would have left that hefty DSLR & lenses at home.What not to expect:1. Long range shooting. You must learn to use 35mm as your only focal length. (okay, it does allow for 50mm & 70mm \"zoom\" but it's merely cropping). I read Steve Huff's article on how shooting exclusively with a 35mm fixed lens can make you a better photographer. He makes some good points. I should mention that I do like birding, so I'm keeping my Minolta D7 with a  Sony 70-300mm G lens for that purpose.2. Price. This is debatable. Clearly Sony has created this camera for the serious photographer, and not the casual consumer. If image quality is your primary need, this could be considered a bargain.3. Lack of an included viewfinder. I will be getting the EVF when it's available, however I don't miss it to the degree I thought I would. My guess is Sony was not able to hold the price of the RX1 below $3000 with an EVF.Conclusion:The RX1 is unlike any other camera in the world, and Sony has hit a home run with it. You'll find yourself amazed by the images it can produce. If you have the proper expectations for the RX1, you will certainly be pleased.

It's razor sharp at wide open, doesn't get soft around the edges... it's as good as any 35 mm lens available for full frame cameras, but it's only f/2.0. If you're looking for ultra-shallow DOF, look elsewhere. Another issue is if you chose to weld a single lens to a FF camera what would it be? For me, this camera was to be mostly for portraits, candids, travel and I think that 50mm would be a better choice, especially for portraits. I'm guessing Sony went through a lot of soul searching, and thought hard about their decision. But in the end I find myself shooting with my 50mm more than my 35mm on my mkII.AF: Works great good light and high contrast situations. AF performance suffers in low light/low contrast: translation, photographs of people in suboptimal lighting conditions come out blurry more often than not. The performance of this camera vs a full-sized FF DSLR in bad light really shows the faults of its AF system. AF assist light is also very bright, and camera really can't focus without it in low light. Tracking moving people, objects, animals, etc. is also rudimentary and this is NOT a camera meant for taking any action photos. The poor performance of the AF is why I give this 3 stars. This camera just can't focus well except in the most ideal conditions.ISO: The camera has great high ISO performance, with low noise, but in most situations your low light photography will be limited by the AF's inability to focus in low light.Flash: There's a flash, it's there. If you really find yourself needing to use this camera with a flash, you probably need to get something else. It's acceptable in a pinch.Design: There's no LVF, you have to buy one aftermarket, meaning you have to hold the camera at arm's length and use the LCD to compose. This isn't natural for anyone used to shooting a DSLR. Control points aren't that intuitive and Sony's menus aren't as user friendly as Nikon or Canon. Aside from the aperture ring, quickly changing settings while shooting is challenging. The camera is \"compact\" but it's a slim rectangle fused to a huge lens, so it's not pocketable and it will have to be worn around the neck/shoulder like a DSLR. The body has no real hand grip, and a bit slippery.Sensor: Perfect. The photos this camera generates are gorgeous. If you take the time to compose your photos and get everything just right, the quality of the images is heartbreakingly good.In short: I wanted this camera to be a portable replacement for an FF DSLR with prime lens. In good light, it takes better photos than my 5DmkII and Sigma 35mm. The quality of the RAWs is just gorgeous. The lens is razor sharp and is perfectly married to the body. The camera is smaller than a DSLR, but a DSLR with prime lens isn't that cumbersome to someone used to carrying one around. Shooting is awkward without an LVF, and Sony will gouge you if you want one. What really upset me is that the AF just can't cut it when photographing people in moderate to low light, and this is where this camera really suffers. This camera shines in good lighting, but it just can't do all the things I need it to do, and when it fails (low light) it can be very frustrating. And, ultimately, the cumbersome controls don't make up for its small size over a proper DSLR, making shooting more of a chore than it has to be.

Yes, this camera is slow  to focus in low light, but once it locks, you get a very useable image, even in very dim light. The digital noise with this camera is somehow more like film grain than the usual digital noise.Images looks terrific regardless of aperture. If you want confirmation, do a search on Flickr for \"Sony RX1\".Very customizable, with three memory banks for your preferred settings.It is a lot lighter that a DSLR and lens, so  great for travel.I think the color rendition, both in JPEG or RAW, is just terrific. Some disagree, but I disagree with them.Bokeh is also nice for a wide/normal lens.Cons:Short battery life. You definitely need at least three to be ready for a day's shooting. Fortunately, they can be purchased on the secondary market for a reasonable price along with the wall charger that you should have received from Sony to begin with.Fixed focal length makes shooting sports or action out of the question. This is a travel/landscape/informal portrait type of camera, which works for me. I can always bring out my DSLR and 70-300mm when I need that.I have the EVF and it helps when you are in very bright light that obscures the LCD, but otherwise I prefer the LCD.I know a lot of folks extoll the virtues of manual focus but I generally don't fool with it. I just compose-focus and fire away.I have never used its video functions. I suppose they might be useful if you see Sasquatch but I am not a video guy.Finally, note that the flash is not \"bounceable\", unlike the RX100, where the little flash can be manually tilted to get a bounce effect. Sony, what were you thinking?Finally, for those who choose to buy, I strongly recommend using \"manual mode\" with auto iso and auto-focus. This gets you around the stubborn auto-iso feature that has been much discussed elsewhere. With manual mode, I first select the shutter speed (which is really a function of whether I am shooting any sort of movement or am in intense sunlight) and then choose aperture based on whether I am going for bokeh or depth of field.

It needs ~3 seconds to zoom into an image, and a few seconds to wake up - I'm always waiting for it.However, when I see the quality of the pictures it takes (high ISO, sharpness, bokeh), I forget about the problems.These summarize my experience during the few months that I'm shooting with it.You can find tons of details and measurements on the web, but for the purpose of this review it suffices to say that I'm very happy with it, and that the fame that this camera got is well deserved.Sony has really good engineers and willing to change the world, so I'd expect interesting news from them in the next few years.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pro-Level Camera With Beautiful Mechanics", "Author": "Burt Reynolds \"Burt\"", "ReviewID": "R2FMV5KZCYDWKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an amateur photographer and probably have an unhealthy lust for cameras.  I've worked with and owned Zeiss Ikon ZE film cameras, Sony NEX 7, NEX VG-900, Canon 5d Mk2, 7D, XTi, Minolta rangefinder, Sony RX100, A7r, Canon XL2, and a few others.  I've gone through a fair share of cameras to know what works for me.I must say that the RX1 is a beautiful camera, aesthetically speaking.  It is crafted with care and devotion.  Everything the Sony A series DSLR's are not aesthetically, the RX1 is.  The controls have a chunky, robust feeling.  They are placed in the proper positions for an average hand.  The flash (although quite inadequate for a professional shoot) is something you aren't forced to see when put away.  The size of the RX1 is just right.  It fits in a coat pocket, and isn't overwhelming when you try to photographs others (compared to the DSLR brethren).  In short, this camera scores 5 out of 5 in this area.I was disappointed that a viewfinder did not come with the camera.  In fact, I would have loved for the camera to have come with an optical viewfinder.  But I suppose that Sony had already planned the A7 series, and because this camera is supposed to be the high-end of the non-professional series of cameras, Sony assumed that leaving out an EVF or OVF was appropriate.  I disagree with this decision.  I tried using the camera with the screen, but it just isn't for me.  I ended up purchasing the external EVF.  It was an additional expense, but worth it for me.  The EVF is very good, and recommend it for anyone who is thinking of purchasing this camera.  Overall, the lack of a viewfinder was a very unhappy situation.The Zeiss lens is a masterpiece.  You may recall that Sony recently purchased Zeiss when it released the NEX generation of cameras.  One of the first dedicated lenses for the NEX from Zeiss was the 24mm, which I purchased for my NEX-7.  That glass is beautiful.  The 35mm lens attached to the RX1 is a step above any other lens I've purchased to date.  I have had the opportunity to use some very nice glass, and the lens on the RX1 is sharp as anything I've seen.Of course the overwhelming complaints out there about the RX1 is its slow focus speed.  It's absolutely true.  It is a pig when it comes to focus time.  Indeed, sometimes it refuses to focus on the appropriate subject, even in bright light.  But when that happens, switch to manual focus and you can overcome this problem.That raises a very big concern for me.  Sony:  Why have you refused to provide any firmware updates for this camera?  Those of us who paid $2800.00 deserve regular updates, particularly with common issues like focusing.  Why is this so problematic for Sony?  Fuji addressed a similar issue with its X-series cameras.  Canon updates even its point and shoot cameras.  It appears that all other types of cameras get updates, but the RX1 and RX100 are left to rot.I suppose this is a good time to rant.  I have no issue with respect to the pictures this camera takes.  They are gorgeous.  In all other aspects, this camera is a gem.  But the focus issue is unacceptable.  When you charge premium prices for a camera, you should be prepared to update the software when necessary.  Sony: THIS IS NECESSARY.  We've been waiting patiently since last year for you to get off your high horse and fix the problem.  You've refused.  Why?  Don't your customers mean enough to you to at least provide some sort of conciliation?  Surely we're not asking for the impossible.  You know what the problem is--you're getting enough feedback to narrow down the culprit in the machine.  Have someone go through the firmware and patch a fix.People who buy your cameras are doing so knowing that they're buying into a relatively new camera company.  You're not Canon, Nikon, Minolta, Ricoh.  You're not Zeiss (even though you've purchased them) and you're no Fuji or Leica.  You're Sony.  You're a company we've come to trust and appreciate.  We love your dedication to perfection.  We like how you think and feel about your products.  You put out some beautiful machines, from TV's to PlayStation's, to BluRay players.  You make a bold statement with each product.  Just as you made with the RX1.So why drop the ball now?  You've asked people to put down $3,000.00 for a camera, to ignore long-standing companies mentioned above, to buy into a completely new type of camera design and brand.  Now that you've got us, why can't you keep us?  I'm not saying that people are going to leave you for not putting out firmware for the RX1 and RX100.  But it's only time before the other companies catch up to you.Look, Fuji has already released the X-T1.  It directly competes with your lineup, believe it or not.  No, there's no other full frame mirrorless out there.  I get that.  But so does everyone else.  How much longer until the rest catch up and provide us with the same features as your cameras?  When that happens, we're going to talk about your lack of dedication to the firmware update for a $3,000.00 camera.  And that will give us pause.  Serious pause.All we want is to believe in you, honestly.  Those of us fortunate enough to buy the RX1 just want to use it to its full potential.  Give us that much.My rant aside, I do very much adore this camera.  I take it everywhere.  In fact, it's always in my camera bag alone with my X100s.  Now that I have a A7r, I'm going to have more trouble deciding which camera to take.  I like that dilemma.  I give this camera 5 stars because of its radical step above the rest, its image quality, its build quality, and the fact that it makes me want to take pictures.I give Sony a big thumbs down for how its chosen to respond to the focus concerns, however.  Please address this, Sony.Other than that, if anyone has questions, talk to me directly if you have any questions about how this camera functions.  It's a brilliant camera.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not for Baby Pictures or Videos", "Author": "Dad2014", "ReviewID": "R3RH17S8GYTPO9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a frame of reference I'm comparing the Sony RX1R with my Sony a65 (with a f1.8/50mm lens mounted).SUMMARYLandscape Shots:  ExcellentBuilding Shots:  ExcellentInanimate Object Shots:  ExcelentPortrait Shots (adults):  Superb!  Details are insane!Baby Shots:  Epic FailureVideo Recording:  Epic FailureI'll start with the bad, and if you feel that this camera is still for you, then the good stuff follows in the end.-THE BAD======FocusingIn a perfectly well lit indoor house, with at least 10 recess lights in the ceiling, the Sony RX1R is very slow to acquire focus.  So much so that if you plan to use this camera as a way to take pictures of your young baby/toddler indoors, you can basically forget it.  Things will come out of focus (due to the slow contrast-based focusing system) or just simply blurry as this camera does not have image stabilization (IS).You need a camera with phase detection, like the Sony a65, to capture those baby moments (which gives you instant focus and instant shot).  Otherwise, if you use the Sony RX1R, by the time it acquires focus, it's too late.  That perfect \"Kodak moment\" has come and gone.Even in a bright sunny day, out at a park, this camera did not perform.  I took 178 pictures of my wife and daughter just playing at the park and I could count in one hand the pictures the came out \"okay\", none of them had that \"Kodak moment\" since the camera was often a fraction of a second late in taking the picture leading to shots where my baby's eyes were closed, or she was turned slightly the wrong way, or just out of focus.My Sony a65 never had this problem.  We often capture lots of those \"Kodak moments\" even in the Auto settings.  I tried to take pictures with the Sony RX1R and set the Shutter priority (S), setting it to a good ISO to allow enough light in, but the lack of image stabilization really hurts the camera in taking pictures if both the photographer and subject are moving.  The pictures just come out blurry or the camera just mis-focuses and often takes pictures of the background (yes I did set the focus to be at the center and the metering to be at the center....that did not help).2-Star for very poor focusing system.  Sony needs to add phase detection or reengineer this._Baby Pictures / Portrait ShotsBecause this is a full-frame camera with a wider-angled lens [compared to my Sony a65], it's not really as suited for taking baby portrait pictures.  You are better off with an APS-C camera, like the Sony a65.  Otherwise, with the Sony RX1R you really have to be in-your-face close with your subject to get that good portrait shot.  Literally, I would have to be 6 inches to 12 inches in front of my daughter's face in order to capture a good head/portrait shot whereas on my Sony a65 I could be 4 or 5 feet away (using a f1.8/50mm lens that's without any zoom).I'm not saying the lens that comes with the Sony RX1R is bad...oh dear god it is sooo good for landscapes and adult portraits (people who can stay still for the picture), again just not for baby pictures.1-Star for not being able to keep up with a 15 month old baby who can't even walk by herself yet.  The Sony a65 never had issues keeping up with our baby._Weight / CompactnessThe camera definitely has some weight to it.  Its definitely lighter than a Sony a65 with a f1.8/50mm lens mounted, but since the Sony RX1R comes in such a compact package, that weight is concentrated on a smaller area, specifically towards the front where the lens is.  It is a little awkward and takes a little getting used to operating such a compact camera [again compared to my Sony a65].  The Sony RX1R always feels like it's going to tip forward.We used this camera during our car window shopping and for 6 hours it hanged around my neck.  At times, I even forgot it was on me.  At the end of the day my neck wasn't tired and it felt great to have such a high-quality camera readily available to take some pictures of cars that interested us.3-Star for the un-even weight distribution of the camera that can make it awkward to use at times._Video RecordingThe video recording/quality of this camera is sooo bad that if you buy a $200 camcorder like my Sony HDR-CX150, the cheaper camcorder will outperform this camera in every scenario--no exception!  It is that bad!!!I've played with the Sony RX1R's video settings for hours trying the lower-end MP4 format, to the higher-end 1080p 60p at 28MBits setting.  The moire pattern that the camera capture makes the videos unusable--its really really bad.  The moire patterns are everywhere from the sidings of houses, roofing of houses, to window blinds, to clothing patterns, even on our baby's high chair!  Anything that has a horizontal or vertical pattern will create lots of moire patterns on the video!The video recording feature of the RX1R should only be used as an absolute last resort.  So disappointing.0-Star if possible.  Video is garbage.  Both indoors and outdoors._Menu / GUI SystemThe Sony a65 and the Sony RX1R uses the same GUI system.  The Sony RX1R's menu/GUI seems sluggish and slow when compared to the Sony a65.  I expected that for such a high-end / expensive camera the Menu/GUI system would be the same or faster than the Sony a65.  Alas, this is not the case.3-Star.  It works._FlashThe built-in flash is virtually useless.  I'm not sure why Sony even added one.  They should have put a GPS instead.  Because the flash is so small and underpowered, unless you are several inches away from your subject, it doesn't provide enough illumination.2-Star.  It's better than not having a flash I suppose._GPSThe Sony RX1R has none.  Cheaper cameras such as the Sony a65 has one built-in.  Once you get used to using a camera with a built-in GPS, it feels like such a technological step backwards to all of a sudden use a camera without one.0-Star.  For not including one!_THE GOOD=======Picture QualityThe Sony RX1R has the good stuff where it counts.  When the camera does lock on, oh it takes very marvelous pictures.  It makes the Sony a65 feel like a cheap camera (which it is by comparison to the Sony RX1R).  I shoot only in JPEG and the quality when compared to the Sony a65 is incomparable.  Less compression and more details (though double the file size).If you only care about absolute picture quality where you (the photographer) and subject are fairly stationary this camera will blow you away!  No questions asked.  The quality of picture you get from such a small package is amazing!  Almost incomprehensible.5-star to Sony for the excellent picture quality of the Sony RX1R._Physical ControlsThe feel to the physical dials and buttons are just top-notch.  They feel and operate very tightly but precisely.  The tactical feel of the buttons feel....well....that this camera is expensive...which it is!Personally, I find the controls a little too stiff and the manual dials on the lens can be a challenge to adjust at times.  Overall, the camera feels great.4-star to Sony for the excellent buttons and tactile feel of the controls on the camera._LCD ScreenSince you will be taking pictures through the LCD Screen of the Sony RX1R, you'd be pleased to know it is big, bright and very high resolution (it has the same size but better screen than the Sony a65's).Some folks like the optical view finder, but I'm glad the Sony RX1R does not have one.  I never take pictures using the viewfinder on my Sony a65 (waste of space).  The LCD screen works perfectly well both indoors and outdoors even on very sunny days (like Colorado).  Who wants to squint and look at a tiny view finder?!  Come on folks, this is not a DSLR.  Don't walk around pretending it is.5-star to Sony for not including an optical view finder and including a super high-resolution LCD screen instead._Weight / CompactnessEven though I listed its weight/compactness as a weakness in the \"Bad\" section, it is also its strength.  The fact that it is so small and compact makes it easy to carry around all day long.  You don't look like a tourist with a gigantic DSLR around your neck that will wear you out.  And you don't attract attention.  People just assumes that the camera hanging around your neck is a $300 camera...which is great!5-star to Sony for the awesome engineering of the camera's form-factor._SUMMARY=======If you need a camera with a fast auto-focusing system that works well indoors or for baby pictures, this is not the camera for you.  However, if you need a camera that takes superb pictures outdoors this camera will be tough to beat especially given its form-factor.I would have given it a 5-star, but Sony really do need to add phase detection on future versions of this camera to improve the speed of its focusing system.  Sony also needs to work on making the video better.  Video quality is definitely very very disappointing.If you mostly take pictures of nature, landscapes, buildings, inanimate objects, and adults, this will be the perfect camera for you.  Keep in mind that this camera has no image stabilization so you will need a steady hand or tripod to shoot.Overall, this is a fantastic camera, a marvel of engineering, but not for what I need it for which is to document/capture my daughter's life.  I wanted to like this camera, I really did, but after 3 days of experimenting with it we came to the conclusion we are not the target market for this camera.  All the sample shots you see from people have who reviewed this camera mostly have buildings and nature/landscapes scenes.  Now we know why.  The Sony Rx1R is not very good on subjects that moves.  Even worst, if both you (the photographer) and the subject are moving.BOTTOM LINE:  If you plan to use this camera to take pictures/videos of your baby.

My X100 died in the field, so to speak and I needed a replacement ASAP.The D700 and D800 are still far more functional and familiar to me, but they weigh far more and are much more difficult to take around town or while on travel.The X100 was great, but mine suffered from SAB and just had a unreliable feeling throughout my years of ownership.  I still consider it a great camera.But moving on to the RX1 -- this is near perfection in terms of the full frame goodness, size, weight, and IQ.  Missing a built in viewfinder is a big knock, but one I can live with and there is a workaround via the add-on.Speaking of add-ons, if you really add a lot of what I'd consider \"standard options\" -- you'd be well over $4000 for this setup.  Lens hood, viewfinder, battery charger, case, extra batteries.  Oh well.  Folks still seem to be in the market for such things so more power to Sony for ripping all of us off.  =)The lack of weather sealing is the final nit I have.  I can't understand why they left that out given the kinds of environments many would be using this camera in.UPDATE 1/2014 -- ended up buying another one since the wife basically took over the first one (she's a pro and is pretty picky).  The clincher for me is 99% tied to travel given how light, how small, how unassuming this solution is.  Plus with f/2 and a FF sensor, low light stuff really works out well.

I have read them all and still was not sure until I saw a refurbished Sony RX1 at 70% of the original price. That was too tempting and I decided to give it a try.What can I say after taking a few dozens of comparative shots with RX1 and x100s? Yes, IQ (Image quality) of pictures taken by RX1 sometimes looked a bit better than what I have gotten with x100s. But 90% of the time I could not tell the difference - full frame or not, Zeiss lens or not. Dynamic range seemed about the same. The only noticeable difference was the blurred background effect at f2.0 thanks to the full frame sensor. Yes, that was quite impressive compared to x100s as it made the objects really stand out. But in terms of overall image quality between x100s and D600 with Sigma 35 f 1.4 Sony RX1 felt closer to x100s than to D600.I really wish RX1 could replace both my x100s and D600, providing the IQ that would match stunning D600 pictures in a camera that weights as much as x100s even if a bit more bulky. Nope, I did not get that. Also, I noticed some green flaring in the pictures taken against the sun by RX1 when x100s would not have those.Also, even with the discount the RX1 was 50% more than what I paid for my x100s. Higher price kind of kills the purpose of having a smaller camera as you don't want to carry a very expensive camera around too much. I feel that I can live with the risk of x100s being damaged or stolen, but I do not want to make this potential loss 50% larger if I upgrade to RX1.This is how I feel about this camera. If you really really value image quality and really really hate large DSLRS, this camera might work for you. But I feel that x100s gives me what I want 95% of the time and for those special occasions when I want to be on the top of technical perfection I will pull out my D600 from the drawer.I hope it helps.

I have spent so much time trying to fine tune my lenses, sending my D800 in for the left AF issue which still isn't perfect in my opinion.  I picked up the sony RX100 a month ago and am amazed at what this cam can do.  I can strap it on my side and take it everywhere. The video is amazing and the Carl Zeiss lens can do macro and shallow DOF shots at 28 mm. The  ISO is not bad for such a small cam. I like the rx100 so much I dropped 3k on the RX1. As with the RX100 the white balance is perfect.  What I gain is extreme sharpness at every ISO/Aperture. The bokeh is better then any of my Nikon gear.  At f2 the lens is tack sharp. The camera is built like a fine swiss watch. Everything lines up perfectly. I picked up the Gordy strap and BW 007 filter. Now for the down side.  I can't track and focus on F18s flying over my roof.  I can't seem to get a tack sharp shot of a kids running at me with a football.

I am casual user who just needs a camera to capture memories from couple of trips and few occasions every year. Naturally like anyone, I want to get the best quality (looking) pictures with not much need of post processing. I have basic skills to get the job done and dont mind spending some money for the same. I have been satisfied with D90 results but always felt it lacks the pop and sometime due to size of DLSR I will just end up taking pics with my smartphone under utilizing D90. I started looking for something which is small but with comparable image quality of DSLR in most situations and ended up getting RX1 after some research and seeing samples.The image quality out of this camera will blow you off. Its capable of taking sharp pictures even in absolute low light and you will be amazed by the results and will keep pushing the button and take more pictures. Its outstanding innovation and I cant think how the camera industry will change over next few years. It offers the best image quality I have come across any camera so far specifically at this price point and size. Even any critical reviewer will agree with it so there are no questions on this.The biggest question - is it right choice for me?1. Autofocus - The camera has slow autofocus which means you will not able to capture sports, kids etc. Sometimes you will be frustrated. But when it locks the focus, you are pulled into its magic again. if fast autofocus is absolute must then this is no go.2. Lens: The lens is fixed and crazy sharp. Its like getting an iphone where you are pretty much tied to an experience as per apple. But the fixed lens is what gives its consistent and superb image quality. If you cant work with a fixed focal length then this is no go.3. Battery Life: Yes battery life is bad for professional users. For me, I need to charge once a day and if I am carrying spare this is not a big problem. But it is an inconvenience for sure and for any professional users it may be a deal breaker. One thing I noticed is as it is so fun to take pictures, I am draining my battery faster pace than I would normally do. From my experience you can get around 225-250 shots without flash easily.4. Pricing: This is definitely not cheap specially with above constraints but not as expensive as many claim. Think of it as you are buying a high end DSLR with one best lens. Flexibility and autofocus of DSLR are negated by size benefit you are getting. I was able to get really good price from amazon warehouse and was able to pay with discounted gift cards which I was able to get from many other deals around thanksgiving/christmas so it was moot point for me. I recouped most of it by selling my existing gear as I don't want to be invested heavily and not missing anything.  Accessory pricing is out of this world and thats the only reason I am taking one star off. I would love to get a EVF but cant justfy at that price.I believe most of these points are covered in all the reviews. There are few users who are very happy and few who are very disappointed. So it shows clearly, this is not meant for everyone. Product itself is awesome and best technology you can buy at this point of time. Just weigh in your needs when you consider with above constraints before you make a purchase.

Pocketable and powerful, the RX1 has a fantastic sensor married to a top-quality Zeiss 35mm lens, which results in images that are extremely clear, with wide dynamic range and great sharpness.The small size of the camera means that it's easy to carry around and, when using time-tested techniques to bolster your body when shooting, you'll find that you can get photos you wouldn't be able to capture with a D-SLR and a similar lens.In 2 months of shooting, I've had more fun with this camera than any camera I've bought in the last decade, and it's worked in all sorts of situations: portraits, landscapes, street shots, night stuff and more. (You can see a collection of my RX1 images over on flickr -- [...]) While it might seem inflexible -- small, with a single lens, no viewfinder -- it really is the most flexible camera I've owned.So, what's not to like?There's a lot of grumbling about the price, but I'd argue that the cost of a full-frame D-SLR and a lens of this quality would cost you this amount regardless, and it's hard to argue about the magic generated by this sensor and lens combo. If you want full frame and don't want to be limited by a single lens, then definitely look elsewhere.There's definitely grumbling to be had about the prices for the RX1's accessories: the electronic viewfinder (which is great), the lens hood, the case and the thumb grip are all priced much higher than they should be.

I basically had to after I got a Nikon D600 and fell in love with that 24mp full frame sensor. The X100 I had used for a year and a half started to show it's age. I like having a small go everywhere camera to compliment a DSLR. Unless I have a specific shoot in mind or a paid gig I hate carrying a DSLR when going out with friends or even just walking around San Francisco (I always have some sort of camera with me).Stand out Pros:The Lens on the RX1 is superb. Extraordinarily sharp even wide open and really nice smooth bokeh. The lens and sensor will give you more resolution, less depth of field (when you want it), & better low light performance than the X100. The focus speed on the RX1 is better but not by a huge amount. They both struggle in low light even with the AF light enabled. The MF is much better on the RX1. The X100 takes way too many turns plus doesn't have Sony's excellent \"Focus Peeking\". This is a mute point if you are now considering the Fuji X100S and not the X100 since focus speed & manual focus look to be even better than the RX1.Stand out Cons:Not having a built in viewfinder really started to bug me after the initial \"this thing is tiny and has a Full Frame Sensor in it\" excitement wore off. I also missed the X100's flash that always seemed to give perfectly balanced shots in low light. AF was the last nail in the coffin. Why didn't Sony use their 24mp sensor with on-sensor phase detection like their A99 has? Why if there is enough light for me to use focus peeking and pretty easily manually focus does the AF still miss completely? This happened more than a few times to me in low restaurant lighting. The price is a bit of a con for most too although the sum of it's parts really do add up right now. It would have been a much better value if it had a built in viewfinder though. I'm sure the next version will.If you have the money to burn the RX1 is an amazing image making machine. I just missed the X100's built in viewfinder, flash and overall feel too much that when I learned of the X100S I decided I would preorder that and send the RX1 back.

I won't go into too many details about what I love about this camera, it's been well covered in these reviews already. In short \u2013\u00a0the lens and the sensor are perfectly matched. I've never had pictures that correlate so closely to my mind's eye, to my memories of scenes and events past. They say the eye sees somewhere around 45mm, but I'm almost certain the heart and mind remember everything in 35. And as 35mm lenses go, this is among the best ever produced. For this reason alone it's worth the price to me. The controls are also well placed. When you have time to setup a shot \u2013\u00a0and you're not relying on the autofocus \u2013\u00a0it handles like a dream. But there are a few of the things that are wrong with it. Of course.Firstly, there is some evidence of Sony having skimped on a few of the pieces and dials, manufacturing them out of plastic where they should have used metal (for example on the bottom plate, the battery door, and rear jog dial) \u2013\u00a0and the lack of weather sealing is a real concern if, like me, you sometimes shoot in the rain \u2013\u00a0but these are forgivable shortcomings. More forgivable than the cheap build quality and poor design of the digital viewfinder \u2013 which despite all the downsides is still a must-have accessory.The poor focus system \u2013\u00a0and as disturbingly, the lack of a single firmware update to address it over the life of this camera (as of June, 2014) says something strange about the software culture inside of Sony. I can only speculate that the CyberShot team apparently has fewer resources available compared to other imaging teams.Lastly, it might be worthwhile to underline the horrendous battery life. But it's a niggle easily mitigated by the purchase of a few extra batteries. Do NOT leave the house for any length of time with less than 3 fully charged batteries. I'd recommend you stick with Sony's NP-BX1, and do not go out of your way to try and save a few dollars on something this important.I also want to recommend the half-case made by Ulysses, a company based in Japan, which is excellent.

That directive coupled with portability, simplicity, and image quality brought my attention to the Sony RX1. After renting this and several other cameras for comparison, I went for it and am happy RX1 owner.Less is more: In my mind, the biggest advantage of the RX1 is its simplicity of use. I'm coming from a very minor photographic background. I learned how to frame and find interesting subjects mostly through the lens of a smartphone. Needless to say, ISO, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed were terms I knew nothing about. I wanted something that didn't rely on the 'right' settings. Having said that, I'm also a willing student and wanted to find a camera I could grow with. The RX1's external dials and on-lens aperture ring were the perfect solution. Instead of burying these key elements of photography in menus, they're right at your fingertips. I can't express how important this was for a beginner.The single focal length was critical to transitioning from smartphone to full-frame (I know, it's probably an atypical transition, but one I could see more making as full-frame prices come down and the photography bug hits a younger generation that grew up with their smartphones as their sole photographic instrument). Instead of evaluating focal length, zooms, and aperture capability the RX1 simplifies the equation. The 35mm focal length is strikingly similar to that of the iPhone. There was no framing adjustment needed whatsoever. Sure, I may lose the flexibility of interchangeable lens systems, but my current needs not only didn't match up with those systems, the increased flexibility comes with increased complexity.Shoot and marvel: The image quality of this camera blows my mind. The bokeh is beautiful. The image is incredibly sharp. The colors are brilliant. The B&W; conversions have tons of character. Even all the way up to ISO 25600, the camera gives me shots that are amazing.Alternatives: I rented three other cameras in my search: Fujifilm X100s, Nikon V1 w/32 mm, Sony a7 w/35mm. Let's start with the X100s. A beautiful camera with a brilliant JPEG rendering. I don't enjoy post-processing and with the X100s I didn't have to. However, the camera wasn't quick to lock focus, had a confusing menu system, and never gave me a shot that dropped my jaw. The Nikon V1 was incredibly fast to auto-focus. I mean, it focused before I knew what I wanted to shoot! The pictures I was getting out of the 32mm lens (an 85mm equivalent) were very interesting. That combo has potential. But, again, the menu system and settings were far more complicated than I wanted to endure. Everything is buried in menus. Not the experience I want when firing on the streets of Phnom Penh. Last, the Sony a7. Great size, great image quality. Obviously very similar to the RX1 in a lot of regards. However, the 35mm F2.8 lens just couldn't match the output of the RX1. I think in a year or two a really great 35mm F2 or F1.8 lens will be released that could meet or surpass the RX1. But for my current needs, the a7 didn't leave me with the same feeling. All three are great cameras and have received plaudits from more experience photographers than me.

I love being able to carry a camera that doesn't warrant unwanted attention; which is key when trying to capture a moment either on the street, or in a more intimate moment like dinner, etc. I've spent extensive time with it roaming the streets of several major cities and I've yet to be disappointed with it's performance.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sooo Close Sony", "Author": "Barry F. Shaffer", "ReviewID": "R1MIMZTNNN2FEM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm mainly a sports shooter with both the Canon 1Dx and 5DmkIII and was looking for a compact travel camera I could take on family outings without sacrificing Image quality. My two choices for this task were the Sony RX1 and the Fuji XE-1.First off both of these cameras met my goal and produce images that meet or exceed what I get from my 5DmkIII. The Sony has the advantage over the Fuji of a much higher pixel count which coupled with it's outstandingly sharp lens that can make up for it's fixed 35mm lens by cropping in for a tighter view (which is basically what it's simulated 50mm and 70mm mode is doing). I was amazed when I pulled some of the images into the computer went to 1:1 - detail is excellent - easily as good as my 5dmkIII with my sharper lenses.However, what I couldn't get over (and ultimately made me chose the Fuji over the Sony) was the design and handling of the camera. While Sony really did an amazing job of making this camera compact, I personally think a camera of this caliber deserves a viewfinder. The (very expensive) optional viewfinder just seems like a hack to me, and it's lack of a means of locking it in place troubles me -  I know I'd knock that thing off the camera as have it bouncing on the end of a strap at my side.I also prefer the Fuji's choice of separate Shutter speed and Aperture dials with an 'A' setting vs. the  PASM mode dial - maybe I'm just old school but to me, that's how a camera is supposed to be.So while I do think the Sony had the edge in IQ (which is a bit unfair since the Fuji had zoom lens) the controls and lack of Viewfinder made me take a pass. If you can get over these issues, it's a wonderful camera...If there is every a nex gen version of this camera with a viewfinder - I'll be the first in line.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Toshiyasu Morita", "ReviewID": "R3OM3CZQZA1N1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If anyone is interested, I uploaded some test pics to my facebook account here:[...]The most surprising pics were the nighttime pics I took.I took pics of a bright streetlight, and it still registered stars in the night sky behind it...the dynamic range is amazing!", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera is the bomb.", "Author": "Neurad1", "ReviewID": "R35KFNHONTL25P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My only complaints are the usual....fixed lens requires zooming with your feet, but once you get a feel for the focal length it comes easily.

It is capable of making gorgeous photos, perfect colors, no need for any post processing. The camera itself is beautiful, the perfect size.I am used to manual focusing so I was willing to accept that the RX1 missed auto focus in nearly all of my photos. It chose objects with higher contrast to focus on even if they were significantly further away from what it confirmed focus on.I couldn't live with the magnification turning on when manual focusing with peaking. This generally works ok for shots where your subject fills the frame and never moves but when focusing on far away objects or any movement (near or far) the zoom function causes you to hunt for a body part/etc. of your blurry subject, wasting a lot of time focusing then recomposing-back and forth.My Nex5n has the option to use focus peaking without zooming in. It is very easy to focus this way then zoom for critical focus after your subject is in focus. It has the added benefit of touching the screen *anywhere* to zoom for critical focus-no more recomposing! Even focusing on small moving children at F0.95 I am nailing every single shot with my 5n. With the RX1 none of my candid shots were in focus. I couldn't justify keeping it and hope Sony comes out with a firmware update to change this.

My NEX7 + Zeiss 24 1.8 can't touch it.  And my A99 with the Rokinon 35mm 1.4 still geats beat by it, by a smidgen. HOWEVER!!!I could write thousands of words on why I don't like this camera and why it went back after two days of using it.Basically, this was going to be the answer to my dream camera, but Sony sacrificed so much to make it tiny that it just was unusable for me.1.  The battery life is an utter joke.  My NEX 7 doesn't get too many shots as it is, but they decided to use the RX100 battery, which is not even have the size--despite it being a full frame camera.  Forget measuring life in shots...you can't carry this around while on for more than 50 mins of use without it going low.  I thought I had a bad battery, but I ordered a backup and nope--this thing burns through them like crazy.2.  The flash is a devolution in design.  Anyone who has shot with an NEX7, 6, or Fuji X-E1 knows how AMAZING the tilt able pop-up flash is.  You can use it to bounce flash in a room and get gorgeous light.  They engineered the RX1 to pop up LOCKED FORWARD so you can only use head-on flash, which is just stupid.3.  #2 would not be such a problem, if I could use the hotshoe for a flash trigger...except...there is no EVF.  So I need to use the hotshoe for an EVF.  Oh, except that I need to put the grip on the hotshoe because the camera is so tiny that there is no way you can use the controls in manual mode if you have averaged sized hands and are trying to set the shutter speed quickly without moving it away from your face.I could go on, but these are the biggies.  Bottom line is that Sony made it too tiny.  The NEX 7 is already small enough, and it has a great grip, controls, and room for an EVF AND hotshoe.  This is a POINT AND SHOOT!!!  Nothing more!!!  If you buy it as a point and shoot you will love it (except for battery life).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not sure I'll keep this, disappointed compared to my other cameras", "Author": "Cynthia", "ReviewID": "R1CP5AZH0X12N8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera on October 2 with high hopes given its full frame sensor, quality Zeiss 35mm lens and the favorable reviews (including one extremely glowing review).  The camera arrived yesterday, December 7, and this morning I spent over three hours in a photo shoot, comparing it to my other cameras.  Based on my comparison, I am rather disappointed and will probably return the camera.  Here's why --I have been an avid photographer for many years and shoot semi-professionally. My workflow is based entirely on the Adobe Creative Suite of products including Photoshop CS 6 and Lightroom 4.2.  I use two large high-resolution professional monitors which allow me to view my images with great detail and in the correct color gamut.  As a travel photographer my primary focus is on landscapes, buildings and other static objects.  I always shoot in RAW format and rarely look at JPEGs until the final deliverable (in the case of an eBook).  This review reflects those biases and accordingly my perspective on this camera may be very different from yours.Currently I use a Nikon D800, Leica M9 and a Sony RX100.  I had a Leica X2 that I sold in anticipation of receiving this camera believing that, with its full frame sensor, the RX1 would generate better images than the X2.  I often find the D800 to be too large and bulky to carry, and I don't use it nearly as much as I thought I would.  I love the M9 but have become spoiled by auto focus.  With its full frame sensor and Zeiss lens I thought this camera might be a fine compromise -- after all, apparently Sony is targeting professionals who need a second, easy-to-carry camera with the RX1.With the significant improvements in image quality that have occurred in the past few years, I now test every camera that I receive; I've found that not every camera or lens lives up to its reviews, and price is not always an accurate guide to image quality (although frequently it is).  My tests are not scientific but they work for me.  I first understand how the new camera works and adjust the settings for my workflow and needs.  Then I set up a sturdy tripod on my deck and photograph the wooded area immediately in back of my house.  There is a lot of detail in this space including hardwood trees, a wetland and prairie grasses.  I always use the self timer and take several pictures of the same exact scene using all of my cameras so that I can compare them side by side.  I did that this morning and actually repeated the test two more times to ensure that I was not drawing false conclusions.  One caveat that could be important is that, at present, Adobe Lightroom does not yet support the RAW format used in the Sony RX-1 camera (although I'm sure they will shortly), so what I did was to use the RAW software supplied by Sony to create high-resolution TIFF files which I then imported into Lightroom along with the other shots.Based on my purely unscientific test, the RX100 -- surprisingly -- appears to generate results almost as good as the RX1.  Yet the RX100 is considerably smaller and lighter, fits into my pocket comfortably and comes with a zoom lens.  Not to mention over $2,000 less expensive.To be sure, the images produced by the RX1 are plenty sharp and crisp.  In my opinion, however, they do not compare with those from the 24-70 mm AF-S Nikkor lens I use on my D800, and there is simply no comparison (at least in my opinion) between the results from the RX1 and the [far more expensive] 35mm Summilux-ASPH lens on my M9 (which interestingly shows some colors in the foliage that do not appear in the Nikon or Sony images).Most disconcerting, and the primary reason I will likely return this camera, is the white chromatic fringing (or blooming?) that appeared in the images I took this morning.  When using Lightroom to zoom in on tree branches, which this time of year are barren of leaves, the images from the RX1 under high magnification show a distinct white outline appearing around the branches.  This outline, which does not appear in the shots I took with my other cameras, seems to have resulted from shooting upward into the morning sky.  It is not apparent per se under normal viewing circumstances, only under high magnification, but is definitely there.Although not a reason to return the RX1, I am also disappointed that it was not supplied with a wrist strap (which comes standard with the RX100) or an AC battery charger (which Sony does not supply with either camera).  I wish I had not sold my Leica X2 in anticipation of receiving this camera.  The RX1 makes me appreciate the RX100 even more -- for me the RX100 is the ideal pocketable camera.  I also wonder if one of the Panasonic or Olympus micro 4/3 cameras with an interchangeable \"pancake\" lens would be a better choice than the RX1, at a considerably lower price.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "RX1 VS X100S", "Author": "Kephas", "ReviewID": "R2YMH7IKLEBQLR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So here's my comparison between the two if you are considering purchasing the x100s.I first bought the Sony and returned it and got the x100s.
