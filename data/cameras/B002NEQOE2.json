{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Tons of features, cool front screen, but bad picture qualit for the price.", "Author": "Jeffrey TG", "ReviewID": "R2GVUQ0DFSJTFE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at the same time my girlfriend bought her Canon SD1200 and I thought mine was better because CNET gave it a much better review. It turns out that the pictures this camera takes, while still quite pretty, don't compare to other cameras (I've checked a few other ones) in its price range. The SD1200 and LUMIX DMC-FH20 are more intuitive, more color-rich, and just better. I couldn't believe it, so I took the same pictures with the SD1200 and this one, using different settings, but I could never get the TL220 to take as rich a picture. The touchscreen is fine, not as good as I expected, and the video is better than the SD1200. Ultimately, these cameras are about pictures, and there are better cameras out there than the TL220.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung can't fix it", "Author": "DonShulaDoingTheHula", "ReviewID": "R7LYB1OGW4NB4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned both the TL225 and the TL220 (this review applies to both in that they are so similar) in the past 9 months and have had the same problems with each model. The main problem is that each camera has displayed \"stuck\" pixels in every picture taken. The location and color of these pixels varies, but I've owned four models and they've all displayed this problem. The pixels are usually red or green, and typically appear around the center of the picture. This is not a problem with the camera display, but the actual CCD itself. Almost every picture we took of our daughter, born in February, has a green dot in the middle. Once you see it, it's very distracting. And every replacement Samsung has sent us (they replaced the CCD three times and replaced the entire camera twice) has had a stuck pixel somewhere in the picture. I can only assume this is a manufacturing tolerance that Samsung assumed no one would notice.Those problems and other minor issues aside (the camera infrequently locked up and/or stopped responding to input commands), I'd rate the camera at two stars based on MSRP and three starts if you bought it for under $150. It's a pretty standard point-and-shoot model and has a lot of fluffy but not terribly useful features. There's a setting to acutomatically take a picture when the camera detects a smiling face (if you're caucasian, anyway). The front-side LCD is mostly a novelty, although it did work to catch my daughter's attention a few times. There are a slew of image stabilization features, but I found that if I took a picture without blur, it usually contained red-eye effects and ridiculously unrealistic colors. The flash has several settings and none of them seem adequate.Overall, I'd call this a \"party\" camera. It's good for taking pictures in conditions where you're not going to get a very good picture anyway, it's easy to fit in your pocket, and if you drop it in a pitcher of beer, you probably won't be too distraught.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Completely ruined my night - do NOT buy", "Author": "BookReviewer", "ReviewID": "R3T3LO2Y3EAYJO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Was trying to record videos of my band at an important show, the next day when going through all the footage I found out that whenever the camera zooms in our out, the audio cuts out. Making all the footage unusable and a waste. All i can say is what a piece of crap, honestly. It also froze a few times. This isn't just a defective unit either as I see online that others have this problem also. The pictures are okay, nothing great either.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "thephoenixking \"dabbler\"", "ReviewID": "R1AZKTENHZSP3G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera takes great photos. The video is also easy to use and you can zoom in and out while shooting. It shoots in High definition and the pictures are high quality on the default setting. You will need a fairly large memory card to hold the videos and pictures because a single picture can be as much as 4 mbs.the camera display on the front is also a nice touch, my girlfriend and i used it in a foreign country where it was hard to get people to take our pictures. So, instead of having to guess for 5 minutes and 10 failed photos where we were and where the background was, this camera made it quick and easy. More time seeing stuff together, less time trying to get a good picture. Thanks Samsung!The battery life is also pretty good. It never failed on a day outing. But charging it before a very long day or two is probably both a good idea and common sense. Also, the front facing screen has some nice features to do with the countdown timer and a clown that helps children focus. However, when on the front facing screen does use up battery life more quickly.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not happy at all.....", "Author": "wulfcity", "ReviewID": "R6FK7SSP7LWN8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this camera for Christmas 2009.  On New's Year day (a week later, and on the first use), the lens would not retract.  Sent it in for repair.  Took about a month to get it back.  Within 2 weeks, the same problem happened.

I truly love the front screen as well which is an awesome key feature of this point and shoot digital camera. I have had is for a long time now. Had one before this one and it got stolen from me so I had to get another one. Overall This camera takes pretty good pictures if you set the smart setting on. The part that I don't like about it is the fact that when you try to take pictures in low lighting, they turn out crappy. As in blurry and even a little pixelated sometimes. This doesn't happen with the correct lighting or outside. Only inside in the house with lower lighting like I said.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad pictures and slow", "Author": "Joeri", "ReviewID": "R2XXVHEJDWJ3IR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We've had this camera for a while and actually got it because my samdung infuse mobile phone took such a good pictures. Here's the breakdown.The good; It looks nice and has some cool features.The bad; Everything else. It fails at being a camera. It's really slow st taking picture especially inside. Then it takes a few seconds to process the picture that is bad anyway. My new lg optimus G phone takes better pictures and much faster.Do not buy this camera and if you did return it.Also, do not use C-net reviews to base your purchase on as it seems that they always rate things better then what they are.Again, just use your phone as a camera, it will take better picture.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "great quality photos", "Author": "Diana Cristina Gonzalez Santos", "ReviewID": "R2D1AHMUTI5YH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "a great product for the price also I love that I can see myself when I take a self portrait, great quality video too", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waste of money!", "Author": "JOHN ZAMPANTI", "ReviewID": "R1WF5V1PYI58SA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera was delivered on time but that is where everything good ended.
