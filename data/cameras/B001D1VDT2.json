{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't buy it.", "Author": "Daves \"Daves\"", "ReviewID": "R31OIGVN660JOH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the the similar model to this on for my store, mine is L15LD420. The only difference is this model 17\" monitor, mine is  15\", my model had 4 channels like this one, the system came with Seagate 320MB hard drive (the instruction indicated that the system can handle up to 500 MB hard drive) .  I just used it just for a simple security system , no internet connected. Just one month after the one year warranty the DVR give me the status \"HDD bad\" . I bought another Seagate 500MB HDD the model that design for surveillance system that can handle the high temperature (not the regular HDD for daily computer used), I have to pay more for this type of HDD. The system work with new HDD for couple weeks the the same symptom \"Bad HDD\" happened again. Because the system said \"Bad HDD\" so I bought a third HDD ,this time is 500MB Western Digital HDD, which is design for surveillance camera , after plug in the system will work couple day then same symptom happened again . I installed the two 500 MB Seagate and WD to my computer, after reformated the two disks function OK, that tell me that the problem is not the HDD but the Lorex DVR system.My concerned is: This is a $1500 (after tax and shipping) product and it broke down just one month after a year (Lorex warranty only one year). If you pay more than one thousand for a products such as 42\" LCD flat screen TV or a flattop/desktop computer or a nice full size digital camera or a HD camcorder or a refrigerator or ..... those will last couple years easily.I believe Lorex made a crappy products and their price quite high. After couple phone called with Lorex Tech-Support I gave those guys a thump-up but what those guy can do with a crappy products.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,799.95", "Features": "Internet remote functions: Live view, Play, Recording, Search & Video Backup, all supported by free Lorex DDNS service\nSingle Channel, Sequential, PIP, and Quad View Selections\n4 included Color Surveillance Cameras: 40ft Night Vision 420 TVL Resolution IP66 Weatherproof Rating\nFeatures include Alarm Block connections, PTZ Camera Support, Audio line input\nIncludes: 17\u00bf LCD DVR, 250GB SATA HDD (pre-installed), Remote Control, Power Supplies, 4 Cameras & mounts, 60 ft. camera extension cables (X4), 10 ft.
