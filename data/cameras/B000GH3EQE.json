I bought the Sigma 28-105mm f2.8 AF for it. Reason i bought this A100 is because i got the Sony R1 a few months back, R1 really impressed me with its results images with Zeiss lens, thats motivated me to buy Sony DSLR too, Sony got great colors balance, contrasty, sharp, and good dynamic range, Not like other brands while colors are off and have yellow cast.A100 is a small and light compare to other DSLRs, it made in Malasia with light plastic, not a real pro body, but more like consumer camera, its good for me cuz i need a light DSLR, A100 is a fast camera in many ways, fast buffer for refreshing time, review, delete, start up, AF is fast too. Images are stunning sharp with the help from its in body Super steady shot. Colors are well balance, bright, and neutral. The LCD on backside has 2 neat features: If you turn the camera vertical the LCD turns vertical too, so you can see the info before shooting. When you put your eyes to the eye piece to look thru view finder, it got smart sensor to turn off LCD on backside to save batt life.The Super steady shot in body is really helps, now i can buy any lenses and sure will have all image stabilizer shots.A small thing that bother me in A100 is the shutter slap noise when shoot, it has a clumsy ( clunk)sound to it.For the price i paid, its the best DSLR in its range.The advantage about A100 is that you can buy many other lenses for it like: Minoltas, Zeiss , Sonys, Sigmas, Tamrons, Tokinas, Vivitars, and Quantaray.im happy with mine, highly recommended to whom who wants a fast , light , small, good colors DSLR. Not to mention good price too.im watching the new coming of Sony pro DSLRs coming in june 07.I use my A100 with OPTEKA battery grip, you can see my review on it here in Amazon, just hit search for OPTEKA grip.[...]", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony's Great New DSLR Camera --A-100", "Author": "D.
