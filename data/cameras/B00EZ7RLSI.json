She is absolutely tickled with it.  Easy setup and worked right away with her phone.  For some reason the kit arrived with a 16Gb SD card (not the micro SD).  Fortunately, I decided before I wrapped it that I wanted to have it fully charged and ready for her to use on Christmas morning.  As a result, I discovered this early enough to make a run to the local electronics store to get the right card.  Otherwise this is a great little kit that I would recommend to anyone looking for something a little better than their phone camera, but with all of the advantages that come with the phone.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overpriced", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R20Z1H09TT8395", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had bought this and thought it was a great idea.  It is a great idea, but it isn't worth the amount they are charging. It does take good pics when not zooming, but when you zoom, it didn't seem any better than any other digital camera under $100.  Also, you cannot delete pics until you take the memory card out and plug it into a computer. This is very annoying. The app that you have to download on you computer isn't the most user friendly either.  Being a Sony product, I had thought this would be a great buy, but am disappointed. I returned it.  The fact that it can be independent of your phone is great tho.  They just need to lower the price to about 150 or so to make it worth the buy.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "SONY QX10", "Author": "Crzpete", "ReviewID": "R1FT5XKS95LZRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very easy set up and works well with my Samsung s4  no issues with itThe mini tripod comes in handy as well", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Looking forward to using.", "Author": "Edward Ruckle", "ReviewID": "R30YC4P38Q3641", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera sensor was flawed.

For the price of $248, you basically get the kit for free as the lens itself cost $248 (new) everywhere else. That (almost) literally is a steal! Everything listed in the kit was exactly as I received (yes, including the Micro SD card  which came with a handy adapter). It even arrived 2 days earlier than Amazon's expected delivery day (shout out to UPS for doing an awesome job!).Set up is pretty simple if you follow the instructions (with pictures) step by step. I did however, had the most difficult time figuring out how to get the clamps to open to attach to my phone. One clamp slides upwards while the other doesn't. Thankfully the side that moves is marked so re clamping it to your phone becomes easier after about the 2nd time trying. The lens does make my phone seem a lot larger because I have to place the clamps in the middle of my phone where it won't press my power button or volume rocker. Holding the phone becomes a bit awkward.Once I downloaded the proprietary app (it doesn't support standard or 3rd party camera apps) and used the activation password, connecting my device via wi-fi was simple. Connecting the lens via NFC was just as simple (just tap the device to the designated area on the lens and wait a few seconds for the app to launch and connect). I haven't been able to fully test the distance I can go without breaking the NFC connection but so far, I manage to go from my kitchen (where the lens was) to a bed room (where I was) and still able to take pictures. Communication between the devices was just about instant. Which is pretty awesome.As expected I've noticed a HUGE improvement in quality of photos compared to the standard camera on my Nexus 4. I even put it in a situation where the only light on was the screen of another phone. Despite the viewfinder on the phone being completely dark, the lens was able to capture the object I had the lens pointed to nicely.My only issue lies with the app, and because this is a new concept I can let it slide. Sometimes (key word) the app continues to run even if the lens is disconnected. You can exit the app and it will still run. I have to go to my Settings and Force Close the app for it to quit.  It might be an issue for those who are battery conscious of their phone.The lens however comes with a lithium ion battery and charges using a micro USB cable. That makes my life easier as I have a dual port wall charger which means I can charge my phone and lens at the same time. My guess is that it takes about 3 hours to fully charge. I'm not 100% sure because I put it on the charger before going to bed. The lens also has an auto off feature which is definitely a plus.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Product performed Poorly", "Author": "Jimmy K-AZ", "ReviewID": "R8WAGY2LDG92X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this item and was very excited to try it out.It arrived 1 day early from Focus Camera, and that was also really cool.Unfortunately the lens has a serious lag when communicating with the phone.I mean, to the degree that you would miss the shots, because the lag would almost freeze the camera from working until it was caught up.Also if you leave the app, you have to reconnect the wifi connection, which is cumbersome, and inhibits getting the shot.Great idea and i think if Sony can address these performance issues, it would be a great addition to any photo line up.Focus Camera was great , this is all about the product from Sony.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great device and price", "Author": "Khalid Hasan", "ReviewID": "R2JFUU9LX1KZQH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My 4 star is for not receiving the advertised product...I did receive the lens, but no extras.
