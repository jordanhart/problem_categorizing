My father purchased this camera for my daughter at the beginning of December and gave it to her as a Christmas present.  I contacted the company the second week of January and asked if I could either return it or exchange it for a different model.  There was no reply.  I contacted them again a week later and they said to send them examples of the pictures.  I sent samples a few days later, again, no reply.  Now I was totally frustrated and contacted them again and said I just wanted to return the camera.  They said that since it had been two months since the camera was purchased I couldn't return it or exchange it for a different model.  (The majority of that time I was waiting for a reply from them) I could mail it back to them and they will look at it and see if anything was wrong. It is not worth the two dollars it would cost me to mail back. I don't think anything is wrong, I think it is a piece of junk.  My kids Fisher-Price camera takes better pictures than this. This is a horrible camera and the company has horrible customer service.  I will never buy another Argus camera again.", "Date": "April 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "don`t buy it", "Author": "ronald \"Ohhhhhhhhhh\"", "ReviewID": "R35BBQ8437FCV4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it sucksthe batery runs out quickly.no flash.the camera decides when it wants to take a picture not you.sometimes it`s own software doesn`t recognice it.and wipes your taken photos when the software doesn`t find the camera.it sucks.[...]piece of trash.it doesn`t accept some bateries.", "Date": "November 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "Argus DC1512 2.1MP Digital Camera", "Author": "N.

It worked fine for Items 5 feet away but any length short of that was blurry. The webcam feature workedwell and portraits work well also.

I was so excited when I got it but it doesn't really work. The batteries run out really quick and it's really hard to put them on to the computer. There's no flash so I couldn't take nighttime pictures. The pictures come out blurry and overall it's worth the price because it barely functions... I wouldn't buy it!", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "a great buy!", "Author": "Judy Catlover", "ReviewID": "R2UJIBH98F1LBA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the price this is a great little introduction to digital photography. I bought one as a \"throwaway\" but am keeping it in my car for times when I forget to take a camera with me. It's not for pros, but it does take good, clear pictures. Nothing fancy, but you can't beat the price!", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Misleading customers should be penalized", "Author": "J.

It says 2.1 MegaPixels and the one you received it's 0.1. This camera is for a kid(not more than 5 years old). It's a piece of crap! So disapointed with this buy. On the packing it doesn't says 2.1 MP, so I wonder were this info came from. A cellphone has better resolution than this junk.Don't be mislead, I recommend don't buy this product, you'll throw away your money.", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "driver nightmare", "Author": "karaokeguitarman", "ReviewID": "R3Q2EVAITC4SQZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Argus DC 1512 drivers are only available with other software which includes toolbars malware and stuff which has not been requested,Companies who download crap should be avoided and run out of town. DC1512 is in my experience not worth installing since it will by neccessity involve doubtful practice sooner or later.
