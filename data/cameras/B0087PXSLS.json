However, the other extras are of debatable quality.  The bag is not at all what is pictured in the picture itself but it will do.  The 46\" tripod was nice but i think I much would have rather just bought the body by itself and bought all the other things separately that were more to my taste.  Overall though... this is a pretty decent starter kit.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$435.89", "Features": null, "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) 16GB Package", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TRiwIlsyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0087PXSLS"}}
