I later returned the Nikon.The camera takes very good photos and the quality of LCD is excellent. I compared the photos with those taken by the similarly priced Nikon 2200, and photos from this camera had better color, more detail etc.But one thing I am not impressed about is the flash. A lot of time, the flash leaves the image too dark. Sometimes though the image is perfect, so I am not sure if it is something I am doing.The camera is light, but a little difficult to hold on to. Next shot delay is almost non-existent for non-flash photos. For flash photos, the dealy is about 5 seconds mainly due to the flash charging. But compared to the Nikon 2200, flash charging was faster.The camera starts up quickly, and the zoom works well.The camera is small enough to carry in your pocket.In all, a very good value for the money.", "Date": "October 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera!", "Author": "Erica \"Erica\"", "ReviewID": "R3PAYAHRNT7E5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the size of this camera. As someone with tiny hands, most camera's are too large or make my hands cramp up. This one did not.The flash seems quite good too. I was amazed at my photos. I have a black cat and a dark home and most pictures turn out horribly. Every photo of my cat taken with this, even in the darkest of corners, turned out bright as day with no wash out.Battery life is good too. Amazon delivered this so fast that my rechargeable batteries hadn't arrived yet and one pair of alkalines lasted me for 2-3 days of playing around and taking about 50+ experimental pictures.The only downside being your picture will come out blurry if your hands shake while trying to take a picture.", "Date": "July 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "PrPr84", "ReviewID": "RGFQGLN1N5JLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is extremely easy to use! It has everything most people need to take good pictures--zoom, landscape mode, portrait mode, close up mode, super close up mode, self timer, tripod mount(I had a Sony that didn't even have a tripod mount). Anyway, so far it has taken great pictures, but if you're going to buy this camera, be sure to also buy some rechargeable batteries. I just put in the batteries that came with it last night, and they were dead by this morning! Rechargeables will probably save a lot of money. This camera is also the perfect size. It's small and light. The only thing that it doesn't have is a viewfinder eyepiece, but that's no big deal to me because it has the viewfinder screen that is clear and sharp.

Robertshaw", "ReviewID": "R1RU307X91PD1U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The weak point of this camera is that it doesn't have an optical viewfinder (which is why the camera got 3 stars instead of 4 or 5).  While we've all seen people in bright sun holding their digitals out at arm's length framing photos in the LCD screen, the best way by far for normal shooting is to use a viewfinder you put up to your eye.  It'a more stable, easier to see in bright sun or if you wear reading glasses and don't have them with you.Otherwise, it's a nice pocket size point and shoot camera.  As far as not being of \"professional\" quality, of course it's not; it's not priced or intended for that...it's a pocket camera that is easy to use and takes good photos if you want to point the camera and take the photo with minimal fuss.  All cameras of this type have a slight delay while they focus; if you're used to a film or \"focus-free\" camera (which means they don't focus at all), the right way to take a photo is by slightly pressing the shutter, then finishing the press when it focuses; this is normal.Take a look at the Oly D540, which is a similar camera with a viewfinder...you'll never regret having the choice of a viewfinder OR LCD screen, instead of being stuck with no choice.", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this camera  - my first digital one.", "Author": "CA girl", "ReviewID": "R1XG7TRQVHVDXN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very good camera!

Balderas", "ReviewID": "RPKZE10V92JK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What I liked about this camera:* Very small size. I was looking for a small size camera, this camera is even slightly smaller than the Nikon Coolpixs. It only requires 2 AA batteries, which gives you a very good battery life without significantly increasing the weight of the camera.* Priced right. There were not many good 3.2MP cameras with 3x optical zoom under $130 when I bought this camera.* Fancy features. I was very impressed with the quality of the video you can take with this camera. I was also not a very big fan of using the digital zoom, but you can take decent close ups using its 12x digital zoom if you need to.What I didn't like about it:* No viewfinder. You'll have to rely on the digital screen for taking all your pictures.* Requires XD memory. I don't believe the world needed yet another flash memory format, though I did like its small size. I recommend getting at least the 128 MB card, which will allow you to store about 180 pictures at a 1200 x 1600 pixels (at this resolution each picture requires about 600KB).* Not the best for \"semi-professional\" pictures.

While I adore my Fuji Finepix 2800Zoom, I wanted something smaller, stowable, and more \"rough and ready\" for a 3-week trip to Europe this year.Olympus cameras are excellent quality and excellent durability; this 4.6 ounce beauty is a marvel!  It goes in a purse or a pocket.  While some may say it is \"too small,\" my hands are small and I can hold the camera and take photos easily with one hand!  The photo quality is excellent outdoors and in good light.  The 3X optical zoom retracts and has an eyelid lens cover.  I took over 100 photos the first day with and without flash, reviewing the photos, erasing some of them, all using the LCD screen, and the batteries held up very well.  Note: this camera has no viewfinder.  All photos must be taken with the LCD screen.HOWEVER: I echo what the other reviewers said about the flash, it is very weak.  Not \"sorta okay,\" not \"borderline,\" but unless the batteries are fresh, the camera has had adequate time to charge the flash, and your subject is close, the indoor photos are \"poor\".  The reason for this is the same reason the camera is so little and light: only two AA batteries.I still love the camera, I gave it 4 stars ****!  It will be a wonderful travel camera.

But this is a dummy proof camera, it has a dial that you turn for all kinds of backrounds. I also have the Olympus 410 stylus. The photos are equal in quality only I feel this one to me is more durable. Takes 2 batteries and I put in a spare 32 memory card. I take the card out and use the HP Photosmart 375 and it prints fantastic photos! I notice there was another review downing the camera but for $140.00 I think it is a great deal. We just retired our first Olympus which I purchased years ago for $700. And it still takes great photos! I guess I will give it to my 8 year old. I am very pleased with this item, highly recommended. It's a basic camera and just a closing note there is no viewfinder you shoot through the monitor so you get what you see.

I would put it in a class with the old Kodak Instamatic film camera - more than a toy but certainly not professional.Pros:  The camera is small enough to slip in a coat pocket, easy to use, takes decent to good pictures.Cons:  Batteries - Yes, it eats through batteries fast (and by this I mean the batteries must be replaced somewhere between 12-24 pictures depending on whether flash is used).  I did notice, however, that when the camera no longer likes the batteries, it doesn't mean they are truly dead.  So don't just throw them out - try them in a flashlight first.  In fact, if you let the camera rest awhile (off for a few hours or overnight) you may find that the battery indicator now seems ok.Dark Pictures - indoor pictures do tend to look dark, even with flash, but you can fix that with the brightness/contrast edit in the software that comes with the camera.  The downer is that you can't just print them as is right away without fixing the picture first.Picture Delay - There is a delay between when you push the button to take the picture and when it actually snaps the picture.  So, what this means is that you think you've snapped the shot but then you move the camera and find out that the real time it takes the picture is not when you press the button but a few seconds afterward. The result is blurred pictures, pictures of the floor or your feet or something else you didn't really want.  So, you have to be very careful when taking a picture and hold the camera very steady in position a little while after pushing the button to make sure that you get the picture.  Overall:  I don't regret buying this camera.  It is useful and handy since it's small.  But I wish I would have purchased something a little better.", "Date": "April 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Hooray for the Olympus D535....", "Author": "Shane", "ReviewID": "R3VERNBHVVRVEW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I received this camera, I didn't expect it to give me full quality shots with premium quality. I expected it to be a camera for simple small photographs that could fit in my pocket. It does a lot more. Olympus' D535 Zoom has a 3.2 MP interface that includes powerful 3x optical zoom and 4x digital zoom. Though the digital zoom isn't really a necessity, it can be useful at times. Another great feature with this camera is it's 7 modes: Automatic (for regular shooting), Portrait Mode (taking photos of people), Self Portrait Mode (for self-portraits), Landscape Mode (outdoor pictures), Nightlife Mode (for nighttime photos), Macro Mode (for close-up pics), and Super Macro Mode (for super close pictures). These features are very overwhelming. Therefore, a lot of button space is needed. The LCD screen is a mere 1.5\". Luckily, anything in this price range won't really get you more unless you search through thousands of websites looking for cheap prices.Many people with big hands will not like this camera. I reccomend Olympus' larger D540 camera for those with big hands. People with smaller hands will enjoy this camera. This camera lacks internal memory with a mere 16 MB worth of pictures. Therefore, an XD card is a MUST for D535 owners. I bought an XD card worth 512 MB at Office Depot the other day for $59.99. That is almost half the price of the camera. Rediculous, yes, but a must. Because it is so small, I reccomend warranties. Other features with this camera includes a self-timer feature that will last for 12 seconds before taking the photo. But, the self-timer feature is nothing without a tripod (sold separately). For those 'beginner' camera buyers, they'll want to try out a starter kit, which I have. It includes a digital camera case, mini tripod, cleaning kit, and a rechargeable battery kit, which is a very useful system.The picture quality is okay. You need a very sunny, very lighted room to get a good picture. That is where this camera falls down. You'll want to invest money in Photoshop Elements 3.0 or a different image editing program if you want to experience total 'photo quality'. But, if you are capable of getting into a well-lit area, you'll be lucky to hear that this camera will take splendid pictures.Pros-Great Picture Capability-Great Optical Zoom for its Price-Great Brand Name that Adds Dozens to the Price-Cheap for A lot of Features-ModesCons-Small LCD Screen-Bad Pictures For Dark Areas-Small Size for Big Hands", "Date": "August 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent close ups, easy to operate.", "Author": "Donna Ashley \"problemchildsmom\"", "ReviewID": "RW5QIWL717NR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Olympus Camedia.

I went through several Polaroid digital cameras before getting an Olympus.  The only complaint that I have with this camera is that when taking pictures on Easter, the auto focus knob on the back accidentally got turned and the pictures were fuzzy.  It is a little difficult for me to tell if the pictures are clear on the screen when shot.  I have to upload them to my computer to verify their sharpness.

To resolve this I had to get a tripod.The next drawback is the size and shape of the camera. While it can and will easily fit into any size camera bag it is a little difficult to hold even for small hands and the shape of it is a little bulky in the front to back measurements making it awkward without a fixed base as your holding platform.Other than that though, it truly is one incredible camera that will deliver sharp crystal clear pictures in almost any type of setting or light.", "Date": "July 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Image Quality, But Too Small", "Author": "Confederate", "ReviewID": "R1O6Z457EFUKNC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is a great travel camera, but it's too small for taking close-ups or telephoto shots.

Also I have to keep playing around with the settings in order for it to take a picture at all indoors, and it often times takes a really long time to actually take the picture. You have to have very steady hands in order for night mode/close up mode not to blur. It takes a bit of practice. Also I found the video to be quite pointless since there was no sound to it.

I recently bought my second one. Another reviewer mentioned about shake and it's true steady hands are needed especially when using the macro lens. For me the slight delay can be occasionally problematic. Yes it uses a moderate amount of battery - I use nothing but Duracells as I've found they just work better and last longer. With two discs I've taken upwards of 800 photos in a few days. For the cost of the camera it's excellent.Photos taken with this little camera have won fair competitions and one was third in a national magazine contest! I've shot closeups with flowers and action shots of high speed dogs splashing into pools (it caught several mid air for some AWESOME shots!) and concert photos. The photos on my website were taken with this little camera and have gotten many excellent comments including from professional photographers. The cover of my book was shot with this camera. When my first one died I was lost - and in a hurry before a concert trip I really wanted to get photos at. I bought another one used figuring I wouldn't have to replace all the discs before the trip. On that trip I shot photos that have now appeared in a calendar.For a low cost, first digital that is point and shoot sometimes on the run this is an excellent camera. Yes it has limitations next to the more expensive and versatile cameras but seeing is believing and there's hundreds of shots taken with this  that have appeared in books, magazines and calendars. Will I upgrade to another camera? Yes eventually. But I'll sure keep this one handy and maybe a spare too.I really can't say enough good about it. Excellent value, easy to stick in a coat pocket and go with. If you're looking for something for mostly outdoor shooting or some indoor use - you can't go wrong with it. If you have a good eye for light and photo structure you can get some excellent shots with it! If you're looking for something to be 100 feet away and zoom up to take a head shot of a person - in darkened conditions - may not be your best choice.For a low cost, functional, results producing camera this one has absolutely earned a five star rating.
