Ferris", "ReviewID": "R3868HZYXUZT5E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just got the camera and flew to Alaska anxious to take many beautiful pictures.  The first set of batteries I used that came with the camera died after 2 pictures.  I put in the replacement batteries that came with the bundle I purchased.  Took a few more photos and those died.  Put in the last two batteries that came with the camera and after just a few pictures - battery exhausted!  Does this camera eat batteries or is the batteries included really that cheap?Thus many shots were not taken because I was miles from where I could buy new batteries.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "plan on going through a ton of batteries", "Author": "karen", "ReviewID": "R1M7PLPWOY3Q3E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "goes through all batteries in a flash, even the recharables.

I have a new grand daughter and of course, when you snap a picture they smile just after it.  This camera does take many shots, but the more you take in one session the lower the quality of the picture.  It also takes many seconds to record the image and you might miss something if you want multiple shots.  The pictures it does take - single shots -  are good and print in good quality", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Recommend it!", "Author": "Diana J Schelb", "ReviewID": "R1KW9E7AWS0AXK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the size, clarity of the photos and the wide angle lens.

I had a really annoying earlier version of Nikon Coolpix, and when my hubby bought this one, I was skeptical, but I am more than satisfied.

I would recommend it.  I do, however, recommend rechargeable batteries since this little unit is somewhat of a power hog.  Regular batteries don't last a long time.  Rechargeable will definitely pay off fairly quickly.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a typical Nikon", "Author": "texaschick", "ReviewID": "RTXZO92WF5GQB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had more than one Nikon and, until now, found the picture quality very good.  This camera takes fair outdoor shots but indoor photos have not been as good a quality as I would like.  The flash has a very limited range and many indoor shots come out either yellow or, if I don't use the flash, a bit blurry.  I'm still experimenting with settings and hope to get some good shots soon.  However, so far, only the outdoor pictures have turned out OK.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "battery charger issue", "Author": "gary bell", "ReviewID": "R3APLN73UXDEP3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the camera is wonderful, the only thing not liked is the battery charger,when you plug it in to charge the batteries,no matter how long it's charging you have no way of knowing when the batteries are totally charged. a bit cheeesy to say the least.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unfortunately Not a great camera", "Author": "Gina M.

The Nikon L610 came highly recommended so I was hoping that the Nikon COLPIX L610 would be the camera for me. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t. The quality of the camera itself wasn\u2019t good.
