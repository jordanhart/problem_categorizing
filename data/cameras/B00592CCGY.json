{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Could of been better...", "Author": "Ariana", "ReviewID": "R28SO9A4YE5HRH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok I'm guessing enough time has passed by to actually write a reasonable review on this camera (2 months.)Installation: The camera itself was pretty easy and standard to install (However, Do not attempt to install this doorbell monitoring system yourself if you do not have some novice knowledge of electrical wiring).  Its definitely not worth burning down your home or actually electrically shocking yourself in the process of installation).I Simply mounted the monitor outside the door and  hardwired the cameras wiring to a light switch inside the home for a constant power source.Video Quality: Lets see, well the monitor itself is a bit small I'm thinking a little larger screen on the monitor would have been much better, I really hate having to squint to see details of people when they come to the door.  Even though the unit is equipped with a small monitor screen the Quality of the picture is descent during daylight hours.  Still pictures of the guests are taken by the unit as they ring the doorbell automatically which is good function, you can also take as many additional still pictures photos at any time simply by pushing the camera symbol on the monitor each picture is given a date and a number in the sequence each picture was taken for easy reference.  Night Vision on the camera is weak and could have been of a lot better quality, the ability to see at night is not that good but does the job barely.  Pictures taken at night expect them to come out a bit grainy. I added a small motion light by the door this helps with the quality of picture being taken in the dark.Audio Quality: Not so good a bit staticky...I didn't like the fact that the intercom is always only a two way speaking system. What I mean is when I'm in monitoring mode I do not like the fact that I can not mute the inside of my home so that other people on the outside can not hear my conversations or what's going on inside my home unless I mute all sounds all together in monitor mode. The ability not to be able to mute all inside noise but still enable outside sounds to be heard inside the home was a huge huge flaw. I mean, Why have a monitoring mode (By the way is a great ideal!) that when monitoring the area outside with video and sound that you have no choice but to allow all people on the outside to hear what's going on in the inside of the home unless you mute all outside noise too??  And believe me this thing has sensitive speakers you can whisper and people on the outside can hear what you said.Conclusion: Well after two months no change in quality and product is still going strong.  I see only three flaws that if corrected could have made this unit one to remember.1)Small Monitoring screen (Could of been bigger)2)Night Vision is weak  (Could have been stronger)3)Monitor mode flaw (When In monitor mode system should have a mute button so that outside guests can not hear what's going on inside the home while the person that is doing the monitoring inside the home should still have the ability to hear what's going on outside)Believe me I know this is a doorbell system and not a surveillance camera however I am reviewing all aspects of the system including the monitor mode since this function is on the doorbell system.  All in All I give this system 3 out of 5 stars.Please check thumbs up if this review has helped you in anyway.

Love the live video monitoring function. If you are not home or don't answer, it takes an automatic picture of the visitor for you. You may also take pictures manually anytime. Two-way intercom works great too.I used some outdoor mounting tape instead of the included screws to install to my brick wall.Can be expanded and upgraded to unlock doors as well.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Failed after 3 months; poor sound, counter-intuitive interface", "Author": "Lindsey A. Carmichael \"UT Archer\"", "ReviewID": "R1EFMMYE3OHMJJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Our nonprofit installed this doorbell camera to increase security. For the first three months it worked well enough, but the sound quality was very poor and pretty much everything about the monitor's interface felt counter-intuitive. I read the manual several times, which is poorly written and vague, and still I could never remember which buttons to push when someone actually came to the door.Worst, after about three months it began to behave strangely, seemingly unable to hold a charge and glitching with video and sound. Then it began to go into some sort of seizure-inducing mode where it flickered horribly and made loud clicking sounds. We tried everything--turning it on and off, recharging, etc. and finally gave up.We will NOT be bothering with a replacement of this same camera, and hope to find something more reliable instead.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to installl, it's still working good.", "Author": "Jim M.

I had to drill a hole in the door for the power cable, ran the power cable through the hole secured the camera to the door and connected the camera to the power source.
