{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Introduction to DSLR", "Author": "Mainiac66", "ReviewID": "R6SHCI8H025Q7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D5200 is a great camera. You can adjust so many settings thru the \"i\" button and the visual feedback on the LCD lets you know at a glance how you are set up. The \"Auto\" mode makes it a point and shoot if that's what you want, but the control of setting your shutter, selecting the ISA rating etc is so much better. Controlling how the camera operates will give you that creative experience that most photographers want. I would suggest a book on photography to go with the D5200 if this is your first DSLR. I had an old Minolta 570 (35mm film) that I remember fondly. The Nikon is bringing back the joy of photography for me. I want to use my camera again.
