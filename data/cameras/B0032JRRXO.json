This is an approx 5-10 second delay every time you want to take a picture.  It may not sound like that much time, but it gets real annoying real quick.Bottom line:It takes pictures.  It takes nice pictures.  They get a little grainy and colors get a little off at low light.  But in good light, it makes good picts.  But the delay between pictures, mostly from the \"Charging the flash\" message, is just too much of an annoyance for me.  Which is a shame, because this is a decent little camera otherwise.

If you look at the specs carefully, there is really nothing to distinguish this camera (A490) from the A480 to a novice or beginner.I had them both side-by-side and also reviewed their specs side-by-side.Proso Truly a fit-in-the-pocket camerao AA batteries and good battery lifeo Good pictures in decent lightingConso Build quality not great.  *VERY* light and cheap plastic.  Cameras from just 2 years ago put this to shame.o Somewhat price. Save the $10 and buy the A480 if you like this style.  These camera often fluctuate $20 at a timeo The camera isn't as well made as prior Canon's in this price range - though it is up on features.o Not so good in low-light conditionsThere is no image stabilization in this camera so low-light photos will be blurry in some cases - be careful of lighting..Overall a good beginners camera but be ready to upgrade - especially if you drop it hard.There are a lot of minor cons listed here, but you get a lot for a $100 10MP beginners camera like this as long as you don't shoot in low-light.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "a fine pocket-able point and shoot camera", "Author": "Te - Saw", "ReviewID": "R1CK3RUFGNJ3AP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera several weeks ago after my six year old Pentax Optio 30 was accidentally damaged. I held off on writing a product review until I learned all the features and got comfortable with navigating the menus. I can confidently say this camera is a great value in a reasonable price range.Pros:- Good picture quality under most conditions in Auto mode.- Great pictures under all conditions if you make use of the many features this camera has to offer.- Uses AA batteries.- Quality materials/build.Useful features everyone should want:- Auto, Scene-based and Program modes- Program mode offers adjustable ISO speed (80 - 1600), white balance, color saturation, sepia tone or black and white, metering, single shot or continuous frames- decent video with reasonably high definition- Normal focus range, plus infinity and macro- Exposure control +/- 2 stops- Playback mode while camera is off and lens is retracted- better than average flash includes slow synchro mode and has adjustable flash exposureCons (no fault with this particular camera - these are general observations):- Short battery life if flash is used often with standard alakalines.(No problem. Buy a four-pack of Powerex 2700 rechargeables. I've been using them for years. Each charge lasts the equivalent of 3-4 pairs of throw-aways! And in a pinch, where CAN'T you buy standard AAs?)- Could benefit from better ergo design.(Why do manufactures pay such minimal attention to grip-ability of small electronics? Of course, if they made things too grip-able, we'd rarely drop them, and they'd sell less replacements...)Anyway, ignore negative reviews written by the impatient and the uninformed.

For a camera under $90.00, the image quality is good and the video quality holds its own as well.The camera's image quality varies.  The image quality is much better outdoors than indoors.  Outside the camera takes fairly high quality pictures.  Macro shots are excellent and portraits are very great as well.  The image quality indoors is still good for an entry level camera but does tend to get grainier (as expected) when there is little light.  The screen displays a much grainier picture indoors than what it actually takes which turns out to be a nice surprise.The flash indoors is essentially useless.  It tends to wash everything out and overall just isn't worth having on.  I'd save the battery and just hold your hand still and you should get enough light to take a decent picture.I was very impressed with the video on the camera.  This was one of the main points when it came to choosing this camera.  The video isn't ready for the big screen but at 480x640, it's good enough to record events of all types.  Again, the video is much better outside than inside.  The camera also has no limit on how long it will record video for.  If you have an 8GB card, it can record 8GB without having to record in portions.  You must use the software provided to convert the raw video into a format that regular programs such as Window's Media Player, can preview them.The modes are somewhat helpful.  I tend to stay on soley auto mode which is what these entry level cameras are really made for.  Action shots (outdoors) turn out surprisingly quite well!The camera's 2.5 inch screen is big enough to preview the pictures you've taken comfortably but I would still recommend seeing them on your monitor.  The camera comes with a lot of software; although, it is aimed more for beginners.  The battery life isn't great with cheap batteries or the ones provided.  I'd recommend going out and spending $10.00 on a double A battery charger so the hassle of constantly buying more batteries is eliminated.Overall I am very pleased with this camera.  My ratings are only applicable in comparison to other point and shoot cameras in this price range.  The quality doesn't stand up to a DSLR but it makes for an amazing starter camera or a camera for an aging relative who isn't interested in all the bells and whistles!", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice, lightweight camera", "Author": "Laura E.

The installation of drivers and software on Windows Vista was easy and painless, and the one-year replacement is cheap ($6.00 at Walmart).  Picture quality as also very good!

For $68 at Amazon, I'll probably buy another as a backup after this one inevitably breaks.I'm on my third Canon point-and-shoot in five years.  I guess I buy Canons out of brand loyalty after owning a wonderful AE-1 for 20 years.  I just need something cheap to take pics for work or the occasional family/friends party picture.  These cheap Canons aren't built to last more than a year or two.  I previously had a Powershot A70 and Powershot A580 and both lasted two years before breaking down.This new A490 is missing a few of the features I got used to with my previous cameras.  One is the lack of a viewfinder.  While the view screen is convenient enough, I was taking pictures of goats in a pen at a farm and the way the sun was reflecting, I couldn't see that the camera was auto-focusing on the fence wires in the foreground instead of the goats.  So I got pics of sharp fence wires and blurry goats.Another thing its lacking which its predecessors had is an ergonomic design that allowed it to be gripped easily with the right hand.  This camera is thinner and flat across, and it won't be long before I drop it.  Better have a solid carrying case too.Also the different shooting modes aren't accessible by a spinning dial on top of the camera as on my previous Powershots.  You have to go in to the menu to access the various modes aside from Auto.I did pay less for this than I did for my previous Powershots so its no surprise the features are lesser.EDIT:  I CHANGED THE REVIEW FROM THREE TO ONE STAR NOW THAT I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO USE THE CAMERA FOR A WHILE.  THE BATTERY LIFE IS RIDICULOUSLY SHORT, SHORTER THAN EITHER OF THE TWO PREVIOUS CANONS I MENTIONED.

For that price, this is quite good camera. However, it has some weak points, you have to consider before buying. For reference, I'll be comparing this camera to my 5 year old Fujifilm Z5FD.UPDATE 27.06.2011: I've used 2pcs 2700mah rechargeables with this camera, and total amount of pictures taken equals to 430 shots, including 10 minute of video and about 5 minutes of picture reviewing. So, battery life is excellent! Don't be fooled by battery low indicator flashing - it started to flash at about 180th shot, but I took more than 220 shots afterwards!1. Poor battery life. A pair of good quality alkalines (included ones), lasted only for 136 shots. I can estimate, that with good NiMH's you'll get maybe 160 shots. Fujifilm lasts for about 220 shots, while having battery twice less in power than Canon.2. Slow general responsiveness, slow AF, slow flash recycling. I put two these cameras side by side, and pressed shutter button on both of them same time. While fuji already saved picture and was ready for the next shot, canon was still saving the picture!3. Acidness of colors. Camera not only oversaturates colors, but also gives them acid look. For example, sky will look more cyan, than blue.4. AWB errors. If there's some quite large, colored object in frame, AWB will give whole picture it's color tint. For example, if taking photo of large red baloon in front of white wall, you'll notice that whole picture will have pink tint.5. Some settings aren't saved upon exit. For example, there are several viewing modes, where you can see various degree of information about the taken image. The setting \"detailed view\" will be reset on \"normal\", after you zoom in or out, so need to change it every time. Very annoying.6. Low resolution, sluggish screen. Refresh rate of screen is about 25fps I can guess. Fujifilm provides 60 fps, and this gives the HUGE difference in actual life. Literally saying, on fuji, what you see on screen, is what you capture, on canon, you always get delay.7. Flimsy battery compartment door. Each time I close it, I got feeling that this is the last time, and it going to fail next time.These were main cons. Now let's list the Pro's of this camera against my old fujifilm (and possibly, your older digicam, which you're planning to replace with this canon).1. More precise AF. Thanks to AF assist lamp and newer engine, this camera provides better AF capabilities. Difference is not huge, but still noticeable. Say, from 100 pictures taken with both camera, about 32 taken with fuji will be out from focus, and only 21 taken by canon will be out of focus.2. Automatic mode switching works like a charm, most times you don't need to touch any setting, camera will detect required mode automatically and switch it. Very handy for beginners and point & shooters.3. AA batteries are great. While it does not lasts that long on AA batteries, they are available anywhere.4. High speed USB 2.0. Most older cameras have slow USB connection, so transfer of 1GB of photos (that not that much, about 300 images), will take up to 20 minutes. This camera provides high speed USB connection, so in 2-3 minutes you'll be done.Overall, this is very good and feature packed camera, considering it's price.

He has been using an ancient (maybe 1980s?) Canon 35mm film rangefinder camera, which is about twice as wide, high, and deep as the A490, and probably 10 times heavier, but interestingly has most of the same features (zoom lens, auto-exposure, flash, general form factor) and buttons.  I recently helped him set the new one up; it was still in its box <g>.  I was taking initial pix in about 5 minutes; about half of that time was wrestling the bubble pack on the separately purchased SDHD memory card (no memory card comes with the camera).  Two alkaline AA batteries were included.  I formatted the card, and then took several indoor pix, with and without flash, in a pretty dimly lit room.  Quality, judged purely on the LCD screen, was acceptable, but definitely better with the flash (no surprise).  Recycle time of the flash was a bit long, even with new batteries.  I expect that it will worsen as the batteries weaken, like most such cameras.  I recommended that he get some of the newer (low self-discharge) NiMH rechargeable batteries.  Setting the camera features using the menu was pretty straightforward, even with no manual in hand, but I have set up quite a few digital cameras, so I had an advantage.  The camera seems a bit flimsy, but that may be just a feeling due to its extremely light weight and tiny size.  This really is a \"shirt-pocket\" camera (which was why I bought it for him; he travels a lot).  It has one interesting feature that can be turned on -- it enlarges the focus zone when the shutter is partially depressed, so you can better see how good the focus is, and the expressions on the subjects' faces.  The LCD screen is small but pretty sharp.  It looks about the same brightness and quality as most other LCD camera screens, so I expect it to be typically hard to see in bright sunlight.  The battery and memory card cover is typically flimsy -- why can't camera manufacturers make one of the most frequently used components a little sturdier?  The controls seem about as good as most other cameras; the 5-position control switch is tactile and somewhat recessed to reduce inadvertent operation, and the zoom works smoothly and easily.  The operating sound effects were pretty loud even at half-volume; I changed them to their lowest audible settings.  The camera CCD is reasonably high resolution (10 MP), and you can select the file sizes that you wish to record.  I set the camera for roughly 2 MB file sizes; it reported it could record roughly 2400 pix on the 4 GB memory card I installed.  I didn't try out the macro capability, but it exists.  I can't say anything yet about reliability, other than my previous comments about possibly flimsy areas.  My guess is that could be a factor for kids or ham-fisted adults.  The gold box deal price was excellent, so there's not a big worry about cost effectiveness.  Bottom line -- probably a good camera to have in your pocket or purse for brighter-than-twilight illuminated impulse shots.  Many similar cameras can get into trouble with dirt in the telescoping lens components, so it would probably be a good idea to keep it in a case or even just a zip-lock bag, to keep crud out of the mechanism.  Right now it seems like an OK purchase that will provide photos that my relative will be quite happy with.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good as a 2nd camera for mobile purposes", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3O5BBFG684QUF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is small and neat.

It does the job for a lot less than a c-note and is a good carry-with camera, better than a phone cam and can slip in a pocket easily.The deets: (spec)  10.0 megapixels and 3.3x optical zoom. Settings for all kinds of photo situations, flash.  13 predefined shooting situations such as bright sun, snow, etc. 2.5-inch LCD. Uses AA batteries. Video function available; you can do short films. There is a microphone for sound with your film.Surprisingly, for a cheap camera, there is a portrait shooting mode with Face Detection technology. The camera detects faces within the frame and  follows them, as long as they are in the frame and facing the camera.However, this camera has no viewfinder. You use the LCD to frame your shot, and that means in brilliant sunlight, you might not be able to see your shot before you snap. Also, it does NOT come with an SD card so you have to pick one up at the same time you buy the camera.At this price, this is a good choice for an entry-level camera, one for a trip where you are worried about losing a more expensive piece of equipment, or for kids. It doesn't feel particularly sturdy but it does the job.**Update As time goes on, I like this camera less and less. The screen is practically useless in bright light (you have to wear a ball cap or figure a way to shade the top.) The AA battery IS a nice feature--these are available even on the Moon it would seem, so you can always keep a spare set of AA's to make sure your camera is functional. The low light performance is very \"meh.\" And there are newer cameras, for less, that have a better feel, more zoom (this is only 3.3x), front and back screens and Wifi. Canon optics are good, especially in small format, but this camera is not the sharpest one in the drawer and feels cheapish compared to newer models of point-and-shoot. I don't particularly enjoy using it--it's mostly the OMG I need an emergency camera better than my phone camera, and it also helps me keep a camera with me 24-7, which is how you can sometimes get \"that shot\" unless you're wearing your DSLR as a clothing accessory. Which, as a kid, I used to do. Back in the dark ages of developing my own film and no instant feedback \"did I get the shot or not?\" Let alone autofocus and in-camera metering.So, there are better choices: I'd look at some of the Samsungs with built-in Wifi; they have more megapixels and features, longer zoom and they actually cost less.For what I paid ($59), this is a good knock-about camera with a lot of features. It is not what I would call my working camera; this is the \"throw in your bag\" or \"camping\" camera if you are worried about your environment. Since this fits inside my MP3 player case, it's a handy take-along.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, if it's on sale", "Author": "chemao", "ReviewID": "R1DBHB2ODFDE2U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera arrived very well packaged and included a carry strap and batteries. It didn't come with a memory card, although I suppose this is par for the course these days. Also included were USB cables to connect to the computer with, and an audio/video cable that can be used to connect your camera to a television's RCA inputs. Finally, as assumed, there were several books of documentation and a CD with the Canon applications. Overall, the presentation was borderline overkill for a budget camera.The pictures are very clear, as expected from Canon. This is my 4th Canon digital camera (A60, S600, S1000, and now A490) I haven't yet taken any night pictures, so I can't comment on the flash, but in twilight conditions it did fine. I typically disable the digital zoom, although I did take a couple of pictures with it enabled just for testing. Obviously, there was a little clarity loss with the digital zoom compared to optical zoom, but it was definitely acceptable. Overall, I'm very pleased with the image quality.The overall build of the camera is definitely not what I've come to expect from Canon. It feels very plastic and flimsy, and reminds me of a disposable camera you'd buy at the pharmacy. The LCD screen, while large enough to preview your images (2.5 inch), lacks resolution and loses some detail. I should interject that the image itself is untarnished, and on your computer or printout will certainly be very nice. The camera is a larger than I had expected based on the product images on the Canon website - and perhaps that was their intent. Even the image of the camera on the box looks thin and sleek. If you look at it,  you would expect the camera to be the size of an S-series or digital ELPH. Alas, it's between those and the old A-series cameras. I'm lead to believe this might have been a packaging issue, since the camera uses AA batteries. While I'm not thrilled there isn't a rechargeable battery, I can definitely see the benefit of this if you're out sightseeing or at an activity and your battery runs out. I would be much more receptive to the AA battery idea if they had found a way to package the camera more tightly so it wasn't so thick.The MSRP on this camera is about $100. Honesly, I wouldn't pay $100 bucks for it. There are many nicer cameras with on the market for that price. I bought mine as a slick deal however, and paid only $50 + free shipping + free camera carry case.In conclusion, this is a fantastic camera IF you can get it on discount. I'd probably be willing to pay up to $65 for the camera, but not really much more than that. Keep in mind, for that price you'd be HARD PRESSED to find another camera that takes pictures as clear as this. Don't be fooled by the the 10 megapixel nonsense. Your Samsung camera with 12 megapixels won't take pictures as nice as this camera. Can I say it's like a Toyota Corolla?

Here is my advice, DO NOT be FOOLED by the megapixels. If you are a casual camera taker, you have no need for huge megapixels and seriously for a causal point and shoot situations, a 7 megapixel is not that much difference in image quality than a 12 megapixel. You will not notice the difference.Heck, I have a 6.1 megapixel super-zoom camera I bought for $230 5 years ago ( they are probably only $100) that I am still using and has features almost like a SLR.So spend a little more, it can go a long way! also buy one with rechargeable batteries!
