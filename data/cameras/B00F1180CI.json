I tried everything bit it does not work, I even tried it on my iPad and I get the same results.I emailed Amazon with the issue and vendor/seller; the seller sends me the same instructions as the manual, they even sent pictures how it's suppose to look. It still does not work. What does it take for Amazon to have the seller send my a return label so I can send it back?!", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "wilspula", "ReviewID": "R2QG7DZBXT2N7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just took this camera to Maui and let me tell you-*it is light*great video image*comes with so many mount*WIFI to your phone so you can watch what video you are taking or what is ine your album.If you are having troble with the phone app make sure you have the right app...i saw 6 different free app and i tried all of them till i got the one that works with my phone..The only issue is i dont know how much power i have right on the camera but it still have power after 2 days...", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F1180CI"}}
