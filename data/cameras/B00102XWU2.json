Hanney", "ReviewID": "R390JQT180B2R8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I reviewed every headphone amp out there looking for the right mix of functionality and cost. I chose the Rolls because of the price, the features and I like the company (I've been very happy with other Rolls components I've purchased). This replaced a DOD that I bought years ago (very noisy). The ART unit was also on my list, but I haven't had luck with their preamps lasting over the years. I'm very pleased with this unit and make full use of the Direct Ins on each channel (I use mono to stereo 1/4\" adapters to feed mono signals into the DIs). The only features I wish it had are tone controls and a second main channel in (these are features of some other units). I compensated for the bright sound by running the input signal through an extra mixer channel I had available and rolling the treble off a bit.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00102XWU2"}}
