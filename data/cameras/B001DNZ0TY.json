{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent small camera", "Author": "Tpres2000", "ReviewID": "R10H9PTEL3V4T5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got an earlier version of this camera, the S550, to take to England to see crop circles. I have a Nikon D70 which I used to take, but that was a lot of weight in my luggage and hiking around the fields of Wiltshire county.10 megapixels is almost twice the resolution of the D70 (I now have a D90) so I still came home with great photos! I also discovered that I could shoot video of the crop circle I was in by mounting the camera on the end of my walking stick, starting the camera shooting video and raising it up over my head, and once I perfected my aim, I was able to get a video panorama of the formation from about 12' up - awesome!Anyway, good small camera, Nikon quality, high resolution, good price - is that enough for you?BTW, I moved up to the S560 because it now has a micro-USB connector, so you don't have to use the clunky connector that came with the S550. Oh, and image stabilization, which I never pay attention to but probably helps.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "J.

The packaging was great, and everything came in perfect condition. I would also like to mention that the seller also sent me a coupon. The camera works pretty well, although the quality isn't perfect. There are some minor defects in some of the pictures but most come out great. I did have a problem where the pictures looked perfect on the screen but after uploading them, they were blurry and nothing could really be seen, this should be fixed. The video quality is pretty good as well, although there shouldn't be a 30 minute time limit. The memory card I received is awesome! I still haven't had to delete any of the pictures and it still has a lot of space available on it. The picture shown is the wrong color however, the camera is actually a darker shade of blue and I think it needs to be changed. Other than that, the camera is great and I am very satisfied with my purchase!", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Picture Quality", "Author": "Amazon Shopper \"Joe in Philly\"", "ReviewID": "R3E8GMIQ4MJFSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera and I cannot believe how easy it is to use and to upload to my computer.  The picture quality is exceptional.  There are neat features like when photographing food you can adjust the tone which helps bring out the color of the different foods (I am in culinary school so I love this feature.  It is also great for portaits.  Pictures of my granddaughters came out very professional looking.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ok", "Author": "lysmyk", "ReviewID": "R2OND9PJG3E3O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera was a replacement camera of earlier model- this one is a bit larger and not as compact as previous model.

The camera shoots with good clarity in daytime shooting, but in low light or at night it has a hard time focusing / taking clear pictures. The video is the best thing about this camera. Really love the clarity and sound of the videos. Overall, I rated the camera a 4 star because of the low light issues (but every camera will have this problem.. some more than others). I would recommend the camera to anyone looking for a low budget camera that does an nice job.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "This camera is not this color", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3RFPEQLU9VBJQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall this camera performs well and I like it. It is fast at taking pictures and they come out clear. I would recommend this produc. However the reason I gave this camera 4 stars is simply the fact that this camera is not baby blue it is a navy blue and I have seen other complaints about this camera on other websites as well. So it is not the seller it is Nikons fault. There are many different pictures of this camera all over the internet and all of them show the camera in the baby blue and it doesn't come in that color.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10.0-megapixel resolution for stunning prints as large as 16 x 20 inches\n5x optical Zoom-Nikkor glass lens; Optical VR Image Stabilization\nBright 2.7-inch high-resolution LCD\nAuto adjusts up to ISO 3200; Shutter and Blink Warning\nCaptures images to SD/SDHC cards (not included)", "Name": "Nikon Coolpix S560 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom with 2.7 inch LCD (Cool Blue)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mahy1i0FL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001DNZ0TY"}}
