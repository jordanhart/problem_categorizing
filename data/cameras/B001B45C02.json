The install was fast, and the new unit has sharp color and a crisp picture. It works very well in low-light, obviously defaulting to a B&W;/infrared mode. It's durable and seems solidly-built, and the adjustable hood dramatically cuts down on glare I was seeing on the old camera.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Impressed, and that's tough to do...", "Author": "MrPossum \"Mr P\"", "ReviewID": "R2LUEP7BK0UBZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old security cameras died a slow death in the Texas sun.  I got motivated the other day to replace them and get the old system back up and running.  Everything else worked, my cameras were shot.  I was replacing some pretty nice and expensive cameras \u2013 but they were about 15+ years old...I ordered a pair of these little color IR cameras having read only one review.  They arrived promptly,  intact and packed well.  I opened the boxes and hooked things up on the work bench and they worked great!  (In regular light)We live on a farm with wide open spaces.  I mounted one high above the house on a rotating antenna rig on my tower so I could see all around the house and barn area as well as my parking lot.  I pointed the other one across my parking lot watching my front gate.The color image during the day was clear and sharp.  You could almost read license plates over 100 ft. away.  I was impressed.  But not half as impressed as when it got dark!  These cameras are supposed to be good for about 40 feet in the dark.  And that's true.  However, on a good moonlit night or when the motion detecting floodlights in my yard kick on \u2013 WOW!  You can see everything!I waited until it was good and dark and shut off the outdoor floodlights...I looked out the front door \u2013 it looked BLACK!  I look at the monitor from the camera and I can see the two cats in the yard, the dog, the fenceline and all the little lights about a half a mile off on the next ridge!  I can even make out all the bushes and trees \u2013 and watch the dog chase the cats in the dark...  With the floodlights on, I am seeing GOOD B&W; detail out to well over 150 ft.!!!  No color, but hey, it sees in the dark!Now I am going to order another pair to point over the greenhouse/chicken coops and pool areas\u2013 I am impressed.Sure, there are probably better cameras out there with even better night vision \u2013 but for the price, I am MORE than happy with my purchase.  I am just going to have to wait and see how they handle the Texas heat in the summer time.  Those 15 year old cameras I replaced were toast!BP", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "Image Sensor: 1/3 inch SONY CCD, Color DSP.
