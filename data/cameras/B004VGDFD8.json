I did extensive research before purchasing the T3 and could not be more pleased.  This kit is the best price on the market and it shipped very fast.  The camera took amazing pictures right out of the box.  I have two kids and the quick shutter speed is perfect when they can't/won't sit still.  The action shots are crisp and high quality as well.  I rarely use the flash even for indoor shots.  The auto mode increases the ISO level and makes the pictures look soft and beautiful.I also read Digital SLR for dummies and picked up some great tips on how to make my amateur pictures look professional.  I would highly recommend the T3 and the value kit.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great except...", "Author": "ThePinkFloyd", "ReviewID": "RZ5JB279UQWTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Buyer beware!  The camera bag in the picture is not the camera bag that you receive with this product.  The bag that you receive is much smaller and can barely fit the camera with just the one lens.That being said... this is a great package.  It's worth it just for the camera, the tripod (which is nice), the memory card, and the extra battery.  I paid the extra 10 bucks for shipping and it arrived the next day so that was awesome.Bottom line: great package, but the bag sucks.  Be prepared to buy a different bag and factor that price into your decision.JB", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Okay Accessories", "Author": "JohnnyRem", "ReviewID": "R39DJQFIXRBW84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First and foremost I ordered this item on a Friday and It came the following Monday, so shipping was excellent!The camera in itself, the Canon EOS Rebel T3(1100D) is an exceptional camera for everyday and professional use.  It has the capabilities of shooting with an Iso from 100 to 6400, it is comfortable to hold, very lightweight due to the hard plastic design, and the user interface is very easy to navigate.The accessories, some good some bad. The SD Card is a 16 GB SDHC class 10, which is a very nice card, plenty of space when shooting just in Jpeg 12 Mp, it gives you well over 2000 pictures to take. The memory card reader is nice if you don't have an SD card slot on your PC.  The Hdmi cord is a nice accessory but when I used it, it seemed to cause static noise on the picture on my hd tv. The tripod is an ok built tripod, when fully extended the lower legs are very thin and feel flimsy so take precaution when using this outdoors or near children.  The bag definitely seems small, but It manages to fit the camera, an 18-55 MM lens that comes with it, and a 50 MM lens.  I do recommend any user to purchase the Canon 50 MM F/1.8 lens. It is definitely a lens to have handy and its only around 100 dollars. As far as the lcd screen protectors, you have to cut it yourself to fit to the screen and they were really blotchy and bad when put on, so definitely pick up different ones or none at all if you take care of your equipment.  Comes with an extra battery which is definitely handy when out and about.  The table top tripod is actually really cool!  Its so compact and structurally very well built.  The memory card wallet is a nice addition too, not the best, a little tight, but definitely also comes in handy.Overall- For the price that you get the Canon T3 with 18-55 MM lens, this is definitely a great pick up for anyone who is interested in getting a D-SLR and starting something new.  This was hands down one of the better kits that the site has to offer for its price. But like I mentioned, picking up the Canon 50 MM f/1.8 along with this kit will make it worth your while!", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS Rebel T3 + 18-55mm + Deluxe Accessory Kit = AMAZING", "Author": "alaskablue2", "ReviewID": "R2WHZR6EMG20W2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This purchase is perfect for a beginning or amateur photographer and includes everything who is ready to start the digital world of photography.

I looked here on Amazon for pricing and feature information as well.  We then went to Best Buy to physically look, touch, try the cameras and see their pricing (They couldn't match what we found on Amazon).  We decided on the package deal for the Cannon EOS Rebel T3 (Couldn't see spending $200 more for 6 more megapixels and a lower scoring view finder for the T3i)We ordered on a Saturday evening, all items arrived on Wednesday (Well before the estimated time).  Some of the reviews remarked poorly about the camera bag; I can only assume due to those remarks the package has been upgraded as the camera bag has plenty of room and appears to be very well made.We were amazed at the quality of photographs this camera was taking!  The ability to have control over various functions or allow the auto-settings to have control is very nice.  The auto-setting seem to be very intuitive for the environment, subject, and whether there is motion involved.Bottom line - for the price this is a very good camera, the package deal made it all that better, and it was still less expensive than just the camera itself at Best Buy.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Comfortable and intuitive", "Author": "Danielle Neithercutt", "ReviewID": "R3NHCGWQZ3KH3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched digital SLRs for just about a year before deciding on the Rebel T3, knowing it was probably going to be the last camera I ever bought.My requirements were it had to have a quick start-up, take crisp and clear low-light pictures and video and most of all, it had to be comfortable in my small-ish hands.  I've been actively shooting for about a month and have caught some excellent shots of my grandchildren's soccer games and gymnastics meets.  The T3 can stop the action and I have some excellent panning shots.  The controls are intuitive for the most part and once I started using it, I quickly became comfortable switching between automatic, movie, sports shots and manual modes.I'm pleased with this purchase and have recommended it to my daughter as she is now looking for a digital SLR.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous photos!", "Author": "spiryt", "ReviewID": "R356HMB3FODB85", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took this camera out from the box, inserted the battery and started taking pictures!

So when my package finally arrived, on time, I was not shocked or disappointed. Although I must say, the tripod, if lengthened, yes the legs become flimsy and are weak. I wouldn't trust my camera on it. If you can use the tripod only at the base of 21' then it's very durable, I feel. I love it. The bag came a little dusty but nothing a few gentle cloth rubs couldn't get rid of. The bag isn't small to me, it is the bag that you see in the description picture and it has room for the camera, two lens, batteries, charging station, and a little more. I love it. I am worried about the top of the bag, the main part holding the camera and my lens, because there is no zipper to secure it, only the clamps. But as long as you're careful, you wont have a problem with this. I might be buying a more secure bag in the future but no time soon. All the products that are listed came with my camera and they are in good shape from what I can see. I have only had my camera bundle for 5 days now. I have used it but I am still a beginner so I am learning the ropes as the days go by. The camera itself and the lens are amazing! I am so very happy with this purchase overall and will be buying more lens in the near future for my camera.

I am by no means a pro at photography but this is a perfect camera for those dipping their feet into the realm of photography.

The camera works well, just as you would expect a Canon product. However, the Accessory kit is a completely different matter. The Camera bag sholder strap  broke within 1 week of use. This was due to the cheap plastic that attached the strap to the bag. After \"fixing\" the attachment with a metal link, the latch that holds the bag then broke. At this point I'm wondering what is so \"DELUXE\" about this accessory kit.  I would not recommend the accessory kit, you would be much better purchasing a quality bag separately.

It has several of the options offered on its bigger brothers but not so many you are overwhelmed.  It is serving me well as I learn more about photography in general.  The kit lens is solid for the price point.  If you are a budget minded beginner this is a great first choice.- Great for beginners- Fairly impressive options for this price pointThe cons of this camera are few but somewhat significant as you gain skill.  The camera begins to show some of its limitations.1. The screen.  The screen on this camera is fairly low quality.  I didn't think this would be a big deal but it turns out it is.  The problem you run into is that you take a pic, look at the result on the screen and it looks pretty good.  But then when you get back to your computer it turns out the image is fairly blurry.  Viewing in the sun is also fairly difficult.  Another big thing with the screen is lack of touch control.  You have to manually cycle through your options (WB, AF, FLASH, etc.)  This makes it difficult if you want to shoot things in quick order.2. Focus points.  The focus points on the camera are hard to see in bright situations.3. Continuous shooting.  The camera seems to do an ok job shooting continuous in jpeg mode but if you are needing something that can shoot raw in continuous this camera has some limitations.  It simply doesn't have the processing power to continuously shoot raw.  This should be expected in this price point though.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "More than I could have imagined.", "Author": "T. J.

I got one of the first Olympus digital SLRs and it was impressive.  Then I got a Kodak HD video and still camera. It too was impressive, but nothing is quite like this Canon or any Canon for that matter. I have had Canon printers and scanners.  I am Canon crazy!I will never need my old FD Canon again.

There are other adapters that have a glass in it.  All this does  is connect the EOS body to the FD macro lens and it has no glass. This means it is like an extension tube. But still the body of EOS does not directly connect to FD lens either.The accessories with this kit were more than anyone could ever want and the kit was only $10.00 more than the usual camera kit. This is truly a huge savings. 2 batteries! While one is charging the other can be used.  I was amazed, because I usually end up buying a lot of accessories every time I get a camera. The memory card works great. The tripod is as nice as the one I paid over 50 dollars for in 1999. The tripod has a level on it too with a carrying case. The bag looks nice but I haven't put the camera away long enough to use the bag yet.I have not yet even had to charge either battery that came with the camera. I haven't used the flash a lot either. I am not sure how long the batteries last if you have to use the flash.The lens that came with the camera is great! The lens with the camera also does close ups of beautiful flowers and jewelry.

That said, I got an amazing deal on this set and am very pleased with the quality of photos the camera takes and how reasonably intuitive it is.

It was far easier to watch a few YouTube videos and figure out the set up and basic functions.  I read a few negative comments about the cheapness of the bag. I have no gripes about it. It's an average canvas bag with plastic clips and nice padding to keep the camera safe.  I appreciate that for less than $450 I got a camera, back up battery, decent carrying bag, 59\" tripod, and 16G flash drive. It's an amazing deal for a really great camera.

I had done plenty of research and for many years now have been wanting to buy my own but never had the money, and I now finally decided to purchase the Rebel T3. Years ago I had been looking at the Rebel XSi line and further research today still kept me on the track of buying Canon. The seller provided very fast shipping and the camera was here in no time. Upon taking everything out of the box, I noticed some of the products are not as pictured, but all work as intended. I received a Lexar brand 16GB SDHC card (a reputable brand in flash memory), and the majority of the other accessories were Zeikos brand. The USB card reader doesn't seem to work with my laptop so I'm not sure if it is defective or just conflicts with my hardware (the ports are all USB 3.0 and despite being backwards compatible, they do tend to sprout issues with legacy devices), but everything else works well. The tripod included (Zeikos brand) seems a little flimsy but it is lightweight and will do the job well for now just starting out into photography.The camera is incredible for someone just coming into DSLR photography and I highly recommend it.

I researched several sites for days and decided this package was the best beginner package for me.  There are definitely other lenses I want, but will have to save $ for them. This bag is awesome it held everything that came with the package, plus our smaller camera and chargers and extra batteries - then it was all stolen from our vehicle.  When I went to replace it, I got the same camera and a similar package, but this exact one was unavailable.  Hate the bag that came with the newer one.  Really miss this one.  The only complaint was the tripod was broken  upon arrival.

I returned the case right away and it has been more than a month waiting for any response on that issue other than standard replies. Totally disappointed by Amazon on this one. It looks like their customer service is getting worse to my surprise. I am giving up waiting for any refund or return of the camera case and will buy myself.The extra battery is supposed to be 1500mAh vs 860mAh (the original Canon in the camera box), but it lasts less than the original canon battery.The camera,the memory card and the card reader are OK, I have not tested the cable yet.The tripod is very cheap and is not actually for this camera although it works. The issue is that the tripod has a pin which pops up and is supposed to go into a hole in the camera, but this Canon camera doesn't have a pinhole so you have to tighten the screw tight so that the pin is actually depressed enough and the camera is compressing the rubber pad around it. The pin this way will scratch the camera sticker on the bottom and eventually leave a dent, if not damage the print.Bottom line is I would not recommend you this kit.
