I had him for a few years and used him off and on. Finding a replacement was gonna be difficult because I didn't want to spend a whole lot, but I still wanted a good quality. I gotta say, this camera is that good quality without a HUGE pricetag. Panorama sweeps are absolutely epic and stitched very well. The interface is awesome and you can go from Auto, to sort of Auto, to everything being manually set. I don't work with the cool stuff (beauty, magic, etc) 'cause I don't think they're that great. Any sort of editing I feel should be done on the computer, not on the camera. But aside from that, this is pretty much amazing. Really small, a lot smaller than my last camera that had 4 AA batteries, and that was hard to get used to. Definitely \"slim.\" I think the most useful setting is the \"macro\" as I can shove the lens right up to the object and he's totally fine with it. His battery also lasts me weeks. I've only charged him the original charge and once again more recently and I got him in the middle of February. He's not on all the time, but I have the constant \"turn off\" \"turn on\" mode going on. So that has to count for something. :)If I were to have a problem with this. It would be that the timer automatically sets back to automatic. So if you're trying to do a series of pictures that you need a 2/12 second time for, you're doing a lot of button pushing. Also, if you use the flash when the camera light is set to \"incandescent,\" everything is blue. Doesn't matter if it was red before, it is now blue. However, I don't really use the flash that often, so that's not really a concern for me, but if you are the type of person who does use flash, just be wary of how the light settings affect the flash.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$279.98", "Features": "14-megapixel CCD image sensor for up to 4,288 x 3216 still resolutions.\n7x Optical Zoom + 5x Digital Zoom\n2.7 HyperCrystal II LCD Display\nShutter Speed - N/A1/2000 sec. -1/4 sec.
