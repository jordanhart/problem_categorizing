{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hand grip for X Vario Very Desirable", "Author": "John B. Griffith", "ReviewID": "R3PFWJ747NLWJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hesitated in purchasing the hand grip as I knew it would add height to the camera and I wanted to keep the camera as small as possible; however, after carrying the camera with and without the hand grip I can safely say that it really makes it much easier to carry when using a wrist strap as the camera can dangle on your finger tips.  I have ordered the ridiculously priced finger loop that attaches to the hand grip and I hope that it is as nice as it appears.  I have used finger loops made from nylon on other Leica cameras and I like carrying the camera that way as opposed to a strap around the neck.  I would recommend XV owners purchasing this accessory and trying it for themselves.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DBL1X2O"}}
