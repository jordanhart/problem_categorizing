{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing little being(Update Aug-28)", "Author": "Z. Wu", "ReviewID": "R2YVP4CIX5U5GT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have NEX-7 and E-M5, I want to write some comparison notes here.RX100 is from Sony which have more similarity with NEX than E-M5, so this list is mostly compare the RX100 to the NEX-7, the NEX-7 have a wonderful hardware and bad implemented software really pi-ss me off.On contrary, this RX100 is an almost excellent camera both in hardware and software.Pros:1. Size of s100 with 1' sony sensor, the auto-focus is super fast and very accurate, much better than NEX-7, better than E-M5 with some lens but fail to match in the tele side.2. It charges with USB, I can attach it to my car charger or remote battery for my mobile phone in emergency.3. It unlike Olympus xz-1,Fujifilm x10, Panasonic lx5/lx7, Canon g1x, it has build-in lens cap, which makes it smaller and a LOT more convenient than those in real life shooting.4. ISO can be as low as 80, compensate some margin for the 1/2000s shutter speed(E-M5's 200 base iso is a horrible decision from Olympus)5. The software(operation system) is derived from Sony Alpha DSLR, unlike the NEX's bad UI implement from Sony P&S; digital camera. It gives you 3 custom profiles, with their own iso range setting. different picture quality setting etc.6. The face detection can be set on for ALL light metering and focus mode. this is a big evolution from NEX(which can only used with matrix metering and multi-focus).7. 20m pixels  is very good with pixel peeping or cropping, thanks to it's large sensor and quality lens, lots of details with base iso.8. It still keep the Sony camera's features:Sony's color profile. I really like this kind of realistic color rendering. Way better than Panasonic's wash-out plain dirty image and Olympus bluish white, more graduation than too much contrast Nikon, and less pink from Canon.Portrait mode have more dynamic range boost.(good trick from NEX)AF-illuminate light is useless.(turn it off immediately when you received your camera, good trick from NEX)Alpha DSLR's multi frame noise reduction is great for iso 3200 and upManual focus with focus peaking and zoom-inLot's filter effects can be applied to video and photo, HDR, Pano, Hand held twilight mode, they are still there.Exposure compensation and white balance you see on screen is identical to the actual shots.9. leaf shutter is almost silent. lower latency compare to NEX-7, super fast, that can sync flash with 1/2000s10. 10fps shutter stream with live view, this is a huge plus from NEX, and the buffer flush is very quick compare to NEX-7 with sandisk ush-i 45mb SD11. almost no screen lag between shots-to-shots(after you turn off the quick review, another trick from NEX/Alpha)12. dual dials control is very good, comparable to NEX-7 and E-M5(NEX-7's tri-dial is a totally hoax, most of the time, 2 of the dials are redundant with same function. )13. lens is exceptional, f1.8 can be used but there maybe some halos in daylight, starts from f2.8 is razor sharp. Macro shoot is amazing(see my photos uploaded to the product gallery)14. photo replay can be zoomed-in and then roll-over each photos to compare the zoomed parts. (NEX-7's tri-dial is useless here, all of them have the same function of roll-over to next photos)15. lots of customization with buttons.better than NEX-5n and comparable to NEX-717. Video function is better than NEX-7, it have more control, and concave dedicate movie button, which in comparison, NEX-7 have a protrude button, can be easily pressed by accident and record unnecessary movie.(Shame on you! Sony, 8 months w/o firmware fix for this!)18. Video active stabilization is effective, panning and zooming is butter smooth.19. dedicate modal dial, with memory recall and movie mode. memory recall can set up to 3 memories for the most distinguish settings, such as 1 for portrait(low iso base range, med shutter speed, portrait color rending, face detection ), 2 for landscape (80 iso, vivid color rending, small aperture), 3 for in-door flash portrait. You can alway record video in any mode with press the movie button, but in dedicate movie mode, you can set to automatic or manual, or Av, Sv and filters for your fine tune of movie style.20. flash can be set to bounce with your fingers, produce nice in-door photos. (good trick from NEX-7)21. white magic rgbw screen is very good, more vivid and bright than NEX-7 outdoor.22. battery is generally good in this category , I shoot 700 photos for half a day, So prepare 2 spare battery for a night and day shoot session.23. Since Adobe released Lightroom 4.2 RC, Raw file can extract more details for high ISO setting, but jpeg out of camera is better than what I expected as well as the vignetting, distortion, purple fringe compensation.Cons:1.front dial is smooth, the smooth dial is excellent for manual focus, but I prefer tick dial to adjust values.2.modal dial is a little tighten to turn.4.no dedicate on/off button for flash. it can only be triggered with menu option to use flash.5.Lens zoom out/in speed is not very fast, if you drop the camera, it may not survive...6. aperture decay fast compare to the focal length, hopefully it can provide 28-35mm with f2.87. no grip, even its small but you'd better have the wrist strap.8. no external battery charger for spare battery.9. no sd card buffering write indicator nor any sign of indication on screen.10. photos and movies in separate replay menu, Sony's old problem though...11. manual can only be downloaded from Sony support website. (No CD manual or Raw converter for a enthusiast camera? )Things I really expected:1. ND filter for landscape under bright sunlight.2. Smart terminal from NEX, So I can hook up EVF or external flash, it's a bad dicision for a camera without articulate screen.3. Trade some aperture range for a little extra on wide lens, such as 24mm f24. Filter thread5. Wifi/GPS6. Dedicate Flash on/off switch7. Traditional focal range display8.info battery provide precise battery level( % battery display like NEX)", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "State of the art pocket camera", "Author": "Michael McKee \"mystic cowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R3NLITL1TNKPPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this from B&H; the morning it was announced. Having it for a day and about 500 photos, I'm glad I bought it. After some very late night prints, I'm thrilled. Bottom line: the photo quality is great.Pros.SmallQuick to focus and quick between shotsExcellent lens with decent zoom rangeGood JPEGS and very good RAW filesNice controls and the front adjustment ring helpsWell builtExcellent manual controlsThe first pocket camera with good manual focusConsSony's menu's are a bit confusingSomewhat limited battery life, though par for the categoryNo manualSlow aperture at full zoomNo external batter chargerMake no mistake, this is as good as current technology allows for a pocketable camera. It's about the same sizes as my Canon S95. It has a similar design, but IMO looks classier. Sony has made good use of the 20 megapixels. Low ISO files are excellent and as good as recent generation DSLRs. The larger sensor does make a difference.Is this worth the extra $200 over a S100 or LX7? That depends. If you print your photos larger than 11x14, the answer is an unqualified yes. Photos show more detail and better sharpness. If you mostly post your photos online, then the advantage lessens, especially if you shoot JPEG. What's the advantage of having 20 MP if your photo is displayed at 2 MP? Yes, the Canon and Panasonic cameras will output RAW files, but in practice, there is little advantage from doing so. You gain little if any dynamic range and all three cameras do a good job with white balance in most cases.If you shoot RAW, the RX-100 is the first pocketable camera that gives you a real advantage with RAW. There is a noticeable difference in dynamic range. Use RAW and there's more highlight headroom and you can pull more details out of the shadows. The bad news here is that Sony's RAW converter program is a bear to use. When Adobe comes out with support for this camera in the next month or so.Sony has copied Canon's front control ring, which is a great thing. It doesn't have the click stops that Canon's does. It has electronic clicks, which do nothing for me. Those can be turned off. Using the ring for exposure compensation, the lack of felt clicks is a negative. Using the ring for manual focus, it's a plus. Call it a draw. It's the manual focus feature that has me excited. Simply put, manual focus on other pocket point and shoots is marginal at best. With the focus peaking that Sony has included along with the front control ring, manual focus is precise and accurate.Some of Sony's extra shooting modes are very useful. This carries over the handheld twilight, in-camera HDR and sweep panorama features that I learned to like in my NEX-5n. There are plenty of other options, that somebody will like. Those are the ones I like. Photos at 100-200 ISO are terrific, and good up to 800. Above that, image quality drops off quickly. Compared to my Canon S95, there's not that much difference in quality with JPEGS. Shooting RAW then working the files a bit in PHotoshop, I'd say the there's a good stop to stop and a half advantage to the RX-100 Did I mention that the lens is very good?Is the camera worth $650? That's a tougher question. Sony sells more capable NEX cameras for $50 more and less. As light and compact as the NEX cameras are, they don't fit in a pocket. This camera will even fit in a shirt pocket, if you don't mind your shirt sagging. It's great for pants pockets or a jacket. While the camera has good manual controls it won't give the same versatility as a NEX or Micro 4/3 camera, let alone a DSLR, which you can get in the same price range. If you want to get serious about photography, I'd recommend getting one of those instead of the RX-100. Panasonic has announced the LX7 which has an insanely fast lens, that should make low light photos easier. Again, if I mostly posted photos online, I'd consider the less expensive but still very good alternatives to the Sony.If you want the best current small camera, especially as a second camera then the RX-100 is as good as it gets.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "The BEST compact camera I've had to date", "Author": "MyKeyReviews", "ReviewID": "R1CS2DLUSOCXDY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As soon as I saw information released about this camera, I knew instantly I wanted to get my hands on it; it looked awesome and the specifications mentioned seemed incredibly impressive for a camera it's size, so when I finally got it(which of course made a big hole in my credit card), I was super excited to play around with the features and see what it could actually do and if it would live up to the expectations Sony had created about this camera.First impressions were definitely positive, it looks remarkably suave and holding the camera itself I found it to be really comfortable even though it only has one grip which is located precisely for your thumb.  I personally think they got a good balance between grip and style, because if they had added any more grip it would have ruined that nice sleek design it has, for example if you take a look at the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX20V, you will see it has a huge grip which whilst gives maximum grip it does overwhelm the side of the camera.Included in the box are the following:Camera | AC adapter | Battery pack | Micro USB cable | Wrist strap | Two shoulder strap adapters | Manual.Things you NEED:SDHC Card (You can choose a different brand/memory capacity, though do remember as this is a 20MP camera, files sizes average around 5MB if your using Jpeg in fine detail, or is around 20MB if using the RAW format (RAW image has a '.ARW' file extension)).Optional:Camera Case (LCJ-RXA) | USB SDHC Card Reader | Spare Battery NP-BX1 | HDMI - Micro HDMI Cable | Anti-reflective Screen Protector- - -The main thing I love about this camera is it has modes which are great for people who don't have a lot of knowledge about cameras and just want to point and shoot whilst getting great results, and there are modes for those who know more about cameras and want to go more in-depth with the settings.The modes which I personally think are great for those with limited camera knowledge, I would suggest using the mode dial located on top of the camera to choose one of the following:1) Superior Auto; \"This device beautifully shoots automatically while reducing blurring and noise\".My opinion: I've always had great results with this mode, on most occasions it takes the picture I want it to, though sometimes you may want select a mode in the scene setting to get a little bit extra.- - -2) Intelligent Auto; \"Automatically identifies the scene's characteristics and shoots a photo\".My opinion: Pretty much the same scenario with the superior auto, it takes fantastic shots most of the time, though I haven't really noticed the difference between both of them, this may be because I haven't had the chance to test them in many varied locations.- - -3) Scene Selection; Here you can select different pre-setting modes to get the most out of certain scenarios:- Portrait; \"Emphasizes subject by blurring away background. Reproduces soft skin tone\".- Anti Motion Blur; \"Reduces blur indoors with poor lighting or for telephoto shooting to obtain clear images\".- Sports Action; \"Shoots fast motion at higher shutter speeds\".- Pet; \"Shoots pets and other subjects in movement to reduce blur\".- Gourmet; \"Shoots food to look delicious\".- Macro; \"This mode is best suited for shooting close-ups of small subjects such as flowers and food in clear and sharp focus\".- Landscape; \"Shoots the entire range of scenery in a sharp focus with vivid colours\".- Sunset; \"Vividly expresses and dramatically captures the redness of dusk and dawn\".- Night Scene; \"Shoots night scenes clearly. Recommend using tripod\".- Hand-held Twilight; \"Suitable for shooting a night scene without using a tripod\".- Night Portrait; \"Automatically fires the flash to illuminate foreground subjects and engages slow shutter to capture background night scenes\".- Fireworks; \"Shoots beautiful fireworks without flash\".- High Sensitivity; \"Reduces blur even without using flash\".You can select different scene modes by twisting the mode dial back and forth, twist the control ring(my favourite and the easiest way), or go to photo tab 5 which is located within the menu.My opinion: You have such a good amount of different options to choose from.  Not only does the camera explain the best situation to use such scenes, but also shows a picture to give you a better idea of what scene they should be used in.I've had some great shots with the hand-held twilight setting, whilst I don't get perfect shots all the time, it has produced better results than all my previous cyber-shot cameras combined!I also really like the portrait mode.There is one option not on the list from previous models and that is the \"Picture Effect\" mode, this has been moved into the menu or can be selected via the function button (if selected), I would have preferred it to be in the scene selection, but that may be because I'm used to it being there.- - -4) Sweep shooting; \"Creates a panoramic image while you move the camera left/right or up and down at a fixed speed\".You can adjust the settings by going into the menu on photo tab 1.My opinion: This is one of my favourite features on the camera that produces truly amazing panoramic results.- - -5) Movie; Choose from the following movie modes:- Program Auto; \"Auto movie shooting where aperture and shutter speeds are automatic, and other features can be set as desired\".- Aperture Priority; \"Adjusts aperture to change focus range and background defocus\".- Shutter Priority; \"Manually adjusts speed to control how moving subjects are captured\".- Manual Exposure; \"Adjusts aperture and shutter speed manually\".You do have the ability to duel record (take pictures whilst recording) however it's important to note that it's disabled whilst recording in AVCHD format '60p 28M(PS)', so if you do want to take full advantage of this feature, make sure your on '60i 24M(FX)', '60i 17M(FH)' or are recording through the MP4 format. When taking pictures whilst recording, you will NOT hear the shutter sound, instead you till see a message on the screen stating \"captured\", this is to ensure the shutter noise is not recorded.Also note that you don't have to be in the movie mode to start recording, you can start recording on most modes/settings by clicking the record button as you would do normally.My opinion: When recording in the best quality the output is phenomenal, the video is so smooth and it focuses on things very well.  To be honest if it wasn't for the fact that my camcorder has so much more zoom than this camera, I would use this camera instead and scrap my camcorder!- - -For those who understand a bit more about camera settings, you will be pleased to have several modes available for you to use:1) Program Auto; \"Automatically sets aperture and shutter speed.  Other settings can be set as desired\".2) Aperture Priority; \"Adjusts aperture to change the range in focus and amount of background blur.  Small value blurs front and back, large value makes even background in focus\".3) Shutter Priority; \"Adjusts shutter speed manually for different effects of moving subjects.  Faster speeds to appear stopped momentarily.  Slower speed to capture traces of movement\".4) Manual Exposure; \"Adjusts aperture and shutter speed manually\".5) Memory recall; This setting lets you go in-depth with pretty much every setting, you can save up to three profiles which you can quickly select for later usage.  This will be a favourite for a lot of people so they don't have to manually set everything all over again.My opinion: I wouldn't classify myself as someone who knows a lot about in-depth camera settings, but thanks to the camera guide which you can pop-up by clicking the \"?\" button, it's given me some really good simple yet detailed tips to get me started.  I still think it will be awhile before I understand these settings fully, however I'm certain I will get there at some point, it just takes persistence.- - -The menu system is a lot different from the previous cyber-shot cameras I've owned, previously when you click \"Menu\", you get a quick menu system on the left hand side to where you can fiddle around with the settings quickly or choose to go into the proper settings menu, however with this camera it goes straight into one menu where you can browse everything.  This for me is something I had to get used to as it is different, however they do have pictured tabs which make it easy to navigate.Another feature which is new to me is the function button labelled \"Fn\", this button lets you navigate through 7 different options that can be changed to your liking via the menu system.Quick options you can select are: Exposure Comp | Focus Mode | Autofocus Area | ISO | Drive Mode | Metering Mode | Flash Mode | Flash Comp | White Balance | DRO/Auto HDR | Creative Style | Picture Effect | Soft Skin Effect | Quality | Image Size | Smile/Face Detect | Aspect Ratio | Not Set.On the front of the camera, there is a ridged ring called the \"control ring\", depending on what you select it to do, it can be used to quickly change the aperture or shutter levels, zoom or even navigate through different modes.  Personally, I welcomed this new feature and have found it to be very helpful at times.The flash is also really good, it pops out automatically when needed, however you will have to manually push it down when you're not going to use it as it's on a springy device.- - -*Helpful information:When transferring files, if you're using the USB lead provided, make sure when it's connected you turn the camera on, otherwise it wont recognise the camera is connected.Personally I would recommend getting an USB SDHC Card Reader, it's so much faster to navigate through files and delete the ones not needed, you can then copy and paste the desired photos onto your computer within seconds.Pictures are located in the \"DCIM\" folder.Videos can be found by going through folders; \"PRIVATE\" - \"AVCHD\" - \"BDMV\" - \"STREAM\".One other important bit of information I need to share is for those wanting to use the RAW files this camera produces, you will need to download a special piece of software, just google \"Image Data Converter Ver4.1 Download for DSC-RX100\", and it should be one of the first results, you then get a choice to download it for Windows or Mac.- - -So far I've had nothing but good experiences with this camera, the size is decent, it's comfortable to hold and it performs very well.  It produces photos with amazing depths of field without the need of using a background defocus mode, which can be found on previous models.Another important factor is it's user friendly to both beginner and more experienced photographers.For what this camera lacks in zoom, it makes up in picture quality and although it is available with a premium price tag, your not going to find another camera available of such size and cost that delivers such outstanding results, so for that reason I would highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "The 2nd to last camera I will ever buy", "Author": "Ted Shafer", "ReviewID": "R3J9EKCI42PWS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been on a 12-year search to find the best pocketable digital camera.  After getting an early Canon DSLR, and trading it in because it was too clunky, I've had a succession of better and better semi-pocketable cameras starting with the Olympus 3030, cycling through Olympus, Canon, Nikon and Sony and Panasonic cameras at the rate of about 1 a year (I find that after about 1 year or 10,000 pictures something tends to break) and finally ending with the excellent Panasonic GX1 mirrorless - which despite pancake lenses and my best efforts, didn't really fit in my pocket and thus didn't leave the house with me nearly as often as I hoped.This is what I have been looking for:*  Sensor: I've come to the conclusion that above ~8MP, megapixels don't matter anymore - 99% of my pictures will only be seen on my ~2MP computer screen, so even with lots of cropping the extra megapixels in today's cameras are overkill.  What is more important in the sensor is its size, which is critical to fast shutter speeds and low light photography*  Optics: I prefer wide angle and lens speed vs long zooms.*  Electronics: faster is better - faster focus, more clicks per second.*  Pocketable - I love my Panasonic LX5 and it is just about the max you can comfortably put in a pants pocket.  The LX5 is an excellent camera in every way but the larger sensor size of the RX100 was too compelling to not upgrade.The RX100 perfectly fits my above criteria and is really incredible - overall a great camera that somehow manages to cram a fast, wide-angle lens and a huge sensor into a tiny body.No point in my reiterating what is on dozens of other blogs/reviews on the overall quality of the camera, suffice it to say that it is fast and responsive and takes great pictures of fast-moving kids even in low light conditions.I see the blogs are divided about the in-camera charging, but I am a big fan - one less thing to carry (but the little flap to the USB port is really flimsy - see below).  I already carry identical USB chargers and cables for my Blackberry so I don't need to carry anything extra for the camera.  So the entire camera and accessories (zero) still easily fits in my pocket.I can't give this camera 5 stars however: the build quality is shockingly bad on the USB door, the battery/SD card door, and the really flimsy flash unit.  I constantly feel like unless I am really careful, I am going to break off something.  Really unacceptable for a $650 camera.2 other problems that smashed together have a perfect solution: no grip makes this little thing hard to hold, and the battery life is mediocre.Why not add a grip and cram a much bigger battery inside it?  Something the size of the 3rd party Richard Franiec grip (I have on order) would be perfect - enough to hold onto, but not so much that it extends further out than the lens.For my next, hopefully last, camera I'd like something similar to the RX100 but modified as follows:*  Wider angle (24mm maybe).  100mm is fine for the long end but I could compromise there to get wider at the short end*  F1.8 or even faster at the short end, with less drop-off at the long*  Equal or larger sensor*  Note: I could accept a larger camera to get the above lens and sensor specs - as much as 15% larger in every dimension would still let the camera (just) fit in my pocket*  Better build quality*  Grip + large batteryPS another tip for pocketability is the excellent GorillaPod Micro 250 tripod, which I have permanently attached to my camera.  Using this, your entire camera kit including all accessories still fits in your pocket.UPDATE: The included manual is pathetic.  There is a useful website, but it is interactive, you can't print it out.  Some helpful users have made a PDF of it and posted in the comments.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "The first pocket camera that feels like a \"real\" camera", "Author": "Nathan D Jedinak", "ReviewID": "R3VOCAHYKGS6Y5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hype surrounding the new Sony RX100 has been immense, with one famous reviewer commenting that the RX100 is the \"best pocket camera ever.\"  As a longtime film and digital SLR and rangefinder shooter, I have pretty high expectations, and pocket cameras have never really met those expectations; but I persist in keeping them around because I can't put a rangefinder in my pocket, and having one on the shelf at home obviously limits opportunities to ply the craft.Bolstered by last year's surprisingly good HX9V, I took the leap of faith and purchased the RX100.  I've shot about 750 frames with the RX100, and I'm absolutely blown away by how much I enjoy it. This is serious image quality, folks.  Outdoors, in good light, the RX100 captures MORE detail than my Fuji X-Pro 1, with good dynamic range and excellent color. The fuji has an edge as light levels decrease, but honestly--the RX100 is as good as the best 400 speed films of today, and I've shot those all over the world, in all sorts of light. With the bright f1.8 lens and image stabilization the RX100 could take you all over the world and reward you with excellent quality. Additionally, the Carl Zeiss lens renders in a unique, characterful way--I'd take it over any DSLR kit lens made. It's that good.Autofocus is BLAZING fast, tremendously accurate, and totally reliable. Face detection isn't quite as fast as I've seen (the HX9V was quicker to acquire a face) but the AF will lock on to your target quickly enough even without \"detecting the face\" that it's rarely a problem. This camera easily keeps up with my highly active 4 year old, and that's an impressive feat.  The user interface is customizable enough that I can put the creative controls I desire at my fingertips, and although Sony's still feel a little like computers to me vs. traditional cameras, it's all very useable for a traditional photographer, and you can work your traditional exposure magic without feeling like the camera is fighting you every step of the way.Negatives?  Well, that lovely lens is only really fast at 28mm, quickly dropping to f2.8 max aperture by 35mm, and dropping from there to a pretty slow f4 at 70mm f4.9 at 100mm.  I'd also really like some sort of front grip on the camera, as the smooth finish looks sleek, but isn't very easy to hold. It would be nice if Sony allowed the choice to use less-aggressive noise reduction; at a pixel level, there's some heavy processing going on, and it's quite noticeable. You won't see this unless you print huge prints at high ISOs, though, and if you prefer this camera does shoot RAW so you have the option of processing yourself.Should you buy this camera?  Yes--the initial reviews weren't just hype. It's so good it has me thinking \"why have anything else?\" It really is that good.  It won't do everything (super wide angle or super telephoto), but if I'm honest with myself, the 28-100mm range is a real sweet spot for travel, art, documentary, and family photography, and the photos I've made with the RX100 are completely and totally rewarding.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera BUT....be careful with the flash unit....", "Author": "James R.

No doubt it will be a big seller.  I bought it purely based on Pogue's review in the NY Times.I ordered it directly from the SONY site because I wanted it for a business trip immediately.So far very impressed with all the features, the user dials and interface are not confusing, the manual is built into the camera for easy reference, and there are plenty of helpful shooting guides to remind you of what to do under different shooting situations.This camera's BIG shortcoming is in the delicate flash that pops up under low light conditions.  Any casual observer will see that the likelihood of the flash having issues with use is very high.  That very thought went through my head upon opening the packaging...  In an era of high risk with consumer product launches, it's hard to believe that there wasn't a discussion on the design team about how the camera would be carried (pocket sized!) or with a delicate moving part having issues under even nominally normal conditions (meaning not encased in bubble wrap at all times).....Went to my business meeting, took some great photos under low light conditions, packed the camera in my luggage as I would any pocket camera, upon unpacking guess what.....the flash had popped up in my luggage and was damaged and would no longer close or open.I called Sony and without any hassle are exchanging the camera (2 weeks of use!).....but even if you treat this like a precious jewel, the odds are 12-18 months from now you'll see many RX100 owners walking around with flashes they manually open and close.....", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pocket Powerhouse", "Author": "Jamo", "ReviewID": "R2FYZSN7FU7NJI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally a pocketable camera worthy of being called a DSLR companion. What's surprising is that it's from Sony, essentially their first attempt at high-end compact segment, and they got most things right.I'm a Nikon D700 user spoiled by its speed, accuracy, and clean full frame sensor output with f2.8 zooms. Always been searching for that take-anywhere camera that fits in my pocket yet able to capture good images.After owning S90, LX5, XZ1, and S100, search continued. Problem with all small cameras is their speed. It's slow. Slow focus, shutter lag, shot to shot time, and buffer causes missed shots, blurry shots. Another problem with compacts is that images look flat, due to small sensor and large depth of field. Faster lens help, but only so much. After a while I just started using my smartphone to take pictures because it was faster, and left the compact at home.RX100 is a game-changer in that sensor 3 to 4 times the size of competitor is stuffed inside a body that's only slightly thicker than Canon S90/95/100. Combined with larger aperture on wide-end, captured images have 3 dimensional look characterized by larger sensors. It's also much faster. Focus and shutter lag is DSLR level, and overall operation is quick.Other features I really like about the RX100:* Function button allows quick adjustment of common settings* Lens ring control dial* Tiltable flash* Full manual controls during video* No annoying lens capOnly thing that I wish it had was lens starting at 24mm and faster aperture on long end, but I understand that size is more important, so I'm ok with 28mm and slower aperture when zoomed. Do not care for viewfinder, tilting screen, or hotshoe, those only add to bulk and complexity, negating the whole purpose of camera like this.With the RX100, most of lower end mirrorless cameras with kit zoom lens such as Nikon J1, Panasonic GF3 and GX1, Olympus PEN, Sony NEX3 or even 5, are relegated useless. RX100 is just as quick, produces images and video that are just as, or even better than any of them, and most of all, it's way smaller, truly pocketable. When you compare the RX100 to these cameras, it's not overpriced, and in fact, offers value.Note: Don't cheap out and buy slow memory cards, at minimum class 10 or 200x or faster, get the fastest you can afford to support the speed of the camera.

Anyhow, in the meantime I wanted a compact none interchangeable lens camera to fill my camera needs. I gave the RX100 a shot after all the rave reviews. After using it for 2 month here is my opinion:1. Image quality is the best out of all compact cameras I've used in recent years. Recent compacts I've used: Panasonic LX5, Olympus XZ1, Canon S100, Sony HX9V.2. Image quality is almost on par with micro43 + kit lens and very close to the NEX5N jpg output. Recent m43 I've used: OMD e-M5, EP3 and GX1.3. Focus speed - almost no shutter lag or focus hunting unlike compact P&S.; The overall speed is on par with mirrorless cameras.So what didn't I like?1. Image stabilization doesn't work well under indoor light which result in slightly blurred photos. The flash also takes roughly 3-4 seconds to recharge which is a bit frustration for me when taking bounced flash indoor photos of a people in slight motion. Without flash any slight moving of the model or your hands will cause blurry photo. I felt compact camera were a lot more responsive taking indoor flash photos than the RX100.2. The size - it is really compact considering the image quality it packs, but it is a tad too big to fit in a jean pocket comfortably. It does fit, but extremely snug and will require some effort to dig out. I'm always afraid of accidentally hitting the power button causing the lens to extend and break in my pocket. So the camera is pocket-able but I wouldn't recommend putting it in your pants pocket (i put it in my pants because I don't carry any bags/man-purse when I go out). You can also put it in your jacket, but it's weight will make your jacket slant to one side. To safely carry this camera you will probably put it on a neck strap or put it in a bag of some sort, so technically portability is no longer in it favor when compared to other mirrorless solutions in this price range that provide better image quality that are only slight bigger in size/weight.3. Form factor - the camera is built like a compact point and shoot, and I feel like I'm shooting with one. I don't know how to explain it but psychologically i put a lot more thoughts in composing my shots using a mirrorless IL form factor compared to point and shoot. I find the photo I took with RX100 to be more casual and less interesting than the ones I took with a mirrorless. I guess I was more careless and didn't enjoy shooting with RX100 as much as a mirrorless.So, all in all, once you used this camera you will never be able to accept the photos quality and speed of a compact point and shoot again. It is a great step up from a P&S; if you have the $ to spare. As a secondary camera to your mirrorless or DSLR this is a great compact choice. However, at this price range I would not recommend this as a primary camera as there are a lot of options that offer more flexibility and better image quality.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stunning photos", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3AOQ9LU5FS1Y4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera since mid-August. I would estimate I have taken several thousand photos with it. I gave it 5 stars when I first started using it. I give it 5 stars today. I've had more fun with this camera, and captured a higher percentage of great shots, than with any camera I've ever owned.I have been an avid photographer for 40 years. I still use professional-grade Nikon film cameras, Canon DSLRs, and Mamiya medium format cameras. I also have a number of higher quality Canon and Panasonic pocket digitals.The Sony RX100 EASILY blows away any pocket camera I've ever used, and in some cases it outperforms even my best 'professional' equipment.It's embarrassing to admit that most of my best photos from the past two months were shot, not with my digital DSLRs, but with my Sony RX100. How come? You've heard \"the best camera is the one you have with you.\" The RX100 is the first camera that's so good and so small that I take it almost everywhere I go. I'm capturing more great images than ever because I finally have a great camera with me almost all the time.Make no mistake, this is a complex camera with a bewildering array of features. While it captures great images on full automatic, it will deliver its best results in the hands of advanced enthusiasts who understand, say, the relationship between aperture and shutter speed. The RX100's advanced capabilities will largely be wasted on duffers who never take their cameras off automatic. But if you are an experienced photographer, believe me: this camera will dazzle you with what it can do.The Sony RX100 is not a replacement for a DSLR in the hands of a professional or advanced amateur. But if you're like me, you may find it's the perfect camera for capturing all those terrific pictures you would have missed because you didn't want to bother taking a 'real' camera with you.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "The BEST yet !!!", "Author": "machoman", "ReviewID": "R2HPO4TGYIFKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few weeks now and it has become my go-to camera, even though I have three DSLRs, four video cameras, and a bunch of lenses.  Why?  The answer is simple.  It takes great photos and video,  has every kind of manual setting you can think of, in both photo and video mode (except maybe audio level in video), a fast 1.8 carl zeiss lens (and not just any zeiss lens, it's a sonnar with a t* coating), and is pocketable.  For most pics and video the quality might be marginally better but not really noticeable, so why lug around my large DSLR and lens combo?  After reading other reviews here are some quick points about this camera:PRICE - look, a Carl Zeiss vario-sonnar t* with a maximum aperture of 1.8 would cost more than the entire price of this camera, so no it is not over-priced.DOCUMENTATION - yes, it should come with a manual or CD but if you're in the market for a camera like this you must know something about photography so using it for a couple of days should make you familiar with all the featuresRAW - support is coming, so no worries hereCANON EOS-M - oh wait, it's coming soon so should I wait?  Probably not.  The reason: It will be thicker with the pancake lens on it, so not great in the pocket.  The Canon pancake lens is not close to the quality of the Zeiss Sonnar t* but the sensor (APS-C) is a lot larger on the canon and will make up for the diminished quality. Can't zoom with the pancake.  If you want to zoom you have to buy an adapter to use other Canon lenses or buy the one they made for this camera which is about $300, oh btw that makes the cost of the camera over $1,000 and no way can you then put in your pocket, might as well use your DSLR right?One final thing.  No one is really talking about the snapshot mode during video, whereby you press the shutter while recording video and it records a photo.  Well, when I purchased the camera, Sony promo said that you can take 17mp stills during video.  Yes, you can but at much lower quality.  I should have realized that basically the camera is just doing a capture (freezing a moment of the video).  So I was a little disappointed with this feature, however in average light the stills are pretty good, unless you super magnify them.  They look great when printed 4x6 and very good on a big screen TV.  It's a neat feature if you're having a family event and want both stills and video and have just one person to do it.  Most camcorders and some cameras (including most Sony compacts) have this feature but the quality of the stills is usually not good so it's almost a useless feature on those other cameras.Bottom line - Great Quality Photos and Videos, Full Manual and Auto Controls, Super Versatility, a feature set a pro would be proud of but a novice could use.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "A gamechanger.

The quality of images and video out of this tiny marvel really does rival my Nex-7 for the most part. I can't wait to be able to work with RAW files whenever Lightroom or Aperture support it. The JPEGs are quite good for now.One of the best features is the pop up flash which can be tilted backward (you have to manual hold it in place) for bounce flash. It works great as long as the room is not too large.This has quickly become my family cam of choice. Here are my favorite features:- Fantastic image quality- Top notch 1080p 60p video, even in low light- Small and pocketable- nearly silent and discreet shutter sound- pop up flash that can be used as a bounce- high quality finish and build quality- fast performance, start up and shot to shot time- fast auto focusMy minor gripes are- wish it had a bit of a grip- flash recycle times are slow- initial price is a high- would love a brighter aperture at the long end- would have preferred the wide end start at 24 or 25mm instead of 28mmAll in all though this is a gamechanger for me. I thought the Nex-7 would be my all encompassing portable workhorse, but the size of the RX100 is just too irresistible.No question this is the only camera I need to take on a vacation.

Wallace", "ReviewID": "R3OVBFIFE56M2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the past few years I've been shooting photos with my iPhone and my Nikon D40. Mostly with my iPhone. Not because it takes better photos than my DSLR, but because it was always with me. In my pocket, and ready to shoot anything.The bummer always comes when you realize that the iPhone isn't good enough to capture almost everything you encounter in life. A DSLR can cover a lot of the bases, but it's a bit impractical (speaking only for myself) to carry around all the time.While Nikon and Canon have been resting on their laurels, and Leica and Fujifilm have been focusing on how to make cameras more expensive - Sony decided to show up this year and drop the most magical camera I've ever had the pleasure of using.\u200bI'm seriously blown away by the performance of this camera. The build quality is great too. The camera is hefty, yet perfectly weighted. It has a black all-aluminum body that feels really solid and you can tell that some folks at Sony really cared about the product they were making.When I was using it yesterday, I felt like I was cheating. Like the camera was too easy and wasn't challenging me at all. It's so incredibly effortless to capture beautiful photos with it. It's sharp as a god damn tack and it's color capturing is close to perfect.\u200b\u200bSony was able to squeeze a 1\" sensor into this thing, along with an amazing Zeiss lens, a great processor, and really excellent software. The large-diameter 1.8 lens allows for the really gorgeous defocusing in the background, but I'm still floored by how small this thing is. I really only thought that huge lenses and big cameras could produce results like that. It even has a control ring on the lens that perfectly emulates zooming with a DSLR. Even better - you can use the control ring for a variety of other manual things like ISO and stop adjustment.I'm no expert on photography, or even the types of specifications that make a camera wonderful. Which makes using the Sony RX100 for me such a magical experience. Using it feels intrinsic and it's something I feel like I can take with me everywhere. When I was pricing cameras in this range I initially wanted a CanonS100 which had been the choice if you wanted a great compact camera, but now that the Sony RX100 is in town, the S100 and even the new S110 have been rendered almost irrelevant by Sony's camera.\u200bThe $649 that this camera will set you back, seems absurd given that you could buy a DSLR for around the price, but this thing is small.This is the camera of my dreams - the one in which I'm never without a great camera when something wonderful needs capturing.\u200bSony really was firing on all cylinders when they were designing this camera. I wish it the best of successes on the market, and I think it would be perfect for folks who want a DSLR for the photo quality, but perhaps aren't really that crazy about photography - just great photos.\u200bPlus it's so pocketable. It's really spectacular.The Sony RX100 is a true turning point for me when it comes to taking photos.

Image Quality was stunning - rivaled the Olympus OMD EM5.Was constantly amazed that something this small could rival m4/3.Sony really knocked it out of the park.Sadly, after 4 months of ownership a very conspicuous dust spot appeared on the sensor - too big and too central to simply forever clone out - suggesting that either the seal of the lens was inadequate or debris was in-camera at time of manufacture.I kept the RX100 in a small Lowe Pro case with belt loop. I take care of my optical gear. I have owned dozens of compact cameras over the years and have never encountered a dust problem with a fixed lens camera.Was very disappointed - again, the camera is a marvel - especially at this price point.Despite the time frame Amazon graciously supported me (Amazon gets 5 Stars in this saga).

You will be pleased I think. Using firmware 1.0 for this review.My preferred settings lean toward cinematography where all-manual operation is used most often, and it's cool a pocket camera supports that way of working now. For photographers, there are cool features such as DMF focus (much like autofocus with full time manual override), AEL lock can be set to the center button, etc. They did not dumb down the computer inside this from the Alpha or NEX levels it seems.You can get the Freniec grip when it comes out but I suggest instead a bottom handle for video such as BARSKA Accu Grip Handheld Tripod System (which is too small for larger hands, but is fine for such a light payload) if not one of the cowboy studio plastic shoulder rigs. This will work well on the flycam nano I think. It has optical image stabilization \"steadyshot\" in concert with digital IS and both crop the image a bit. There are separate SteadyShot settings for stills and video, \"Active\" is stronger crop factor than \"Standard\" which would be for more stable situations. It works well enough for me to handhold 1/20th OK for stills and doesn't look bad on video.Tragically, there is no 24p, but there is 60p (or 50p in those countries, can't have both in one body, I figure they are trying to prevent gray market sales with that restriction). The 60p should be shot at 1/60th shutter speed or faster, you will have motion artifacting below that. The problem of course is 1/60th at 60fps looks too clear and smooth to be cinematic, it's video. But \"nearest neighbor\" rate conforming works OK, and retiming rate conform, to make 40% slo-mo, works fine too, although not a really impressive slo-mo like an FS700 can do. There is no timelapse support and no remote to workaround that with.For creative style, I suggest Standard -3, -3, -3. You could do -2 saturation but you are trading off detail in the reds with rich redness. Dynamic range optimizer you might get away with, it doesn't seem to change much while shooting when not on Auto, and boosts the shadows for a flatter response curve. It does not affect the highlights like Canon's HTP. I like to shoot somewhat flat and push in post so maybe DRO 1 is a good thing. There is a handy meter offset next to the aperture readout that tells you what it thinks you should adjust in EVs, based on the metering mode you have selected.There is a lot of coarse blue noise at ISO 3200. DRO boosts this noise a lot, so I would only use DRO at low ISO if ever. The worst thing for video regarding noise is you can't prevent digital zoom from being available...it is locked on in movie mode, and if you zoom past optical (there is a visual detente but not a practical one really) your noise profile will change (to coarser) and that may defeat your NR profiles you are applying, causing headaches. They should allow the disabling of digital zoom in movie mode, even though in daylight it's good.Macro is available, to the 2 inch point, only at the widest end, which is fine. The minimum focus distance is 18 inches or so full tele. Video AF is usable, manual of course is better, but it's nice for run and gun and the manual control ring turns to Aperture control which is very cool for rapidly controlling exposure. Aperture changes this way are far smoother than on Canons. The plastic, but tough looking lens barrel retracts midway a bit but it always out when on.I suggest a screen protector for the LCD as you want this in your pocket guilt-free, otherwise there is no point. The LCD is good, VGA but bright. You could glue on a cheap magnetic loupe to make it an EVF (and cheesycam is coming out with magnetic CP and ND filters for the lens) I suppose. There is a micro HDMI port on the bottom, immediately next to the tripod mount, which makes it hard to use without a clever 1/4-20 rig, which I found I could do. Worse is the battery and memory compartment cannot be accessed period without unmounting from tripod. Odd restriction.Another odd restriction is all the JPEG-only things can't be done in RAW + JPEG. Why can't I have both an HDR photo and its RAW ingredients? My 5D3 allows this. So if stuff doesn't work it may be a mode restriction. HDR of 6EV range looks more like 3EV range, but it is nicely graded and not like one of those paintings (though that may be one of the picture styles built in).I often prefer Kelvin white balances which this allows (Canon restricts that to pro bodies), though the color shift thing is a bit coarse for fine adjustment on the RX100. It's very easy to set up custom white balance compared to Canons, but for some reason they make you switch to a stills mode to do it. Expose the still properly and aim at a neutral spot. It will apply to movie mode when you switch, automatically.The bokeh is bit wooly especially toward the corners but there is in-camera correction of CA and distortion and the centers are terrific, which is fine. This isn't the quality of an APS-C sensor camera like the Rebel, but it is better than any pocketable camera I know of. There is good and shallow DOF available at all focal lengths.The manual control ring can indeed get stuck on a tripod plate (it protrudes past the bottom edge a touch) so you will have to use smaller plates or deftly avoid the conflict. Peaking cannot be assigned to a function button but I just leave it on when in manual focus. Bracketing is a drive mode and offers 0.3 or 0.7 stop options, but they seem broader range than described and work fine. There is WB bracketing if you are odd like that.Controls are somewhat customizable, I have white balance to the left of the dial (instead of drive mode), ISO to the right (instead of flash), and AF/MF control toggle on the center. I put a bunch of what moved into the Fn button array. The movies are kept apart from the stills, even in the internal player, and are down in PRIVATE/AVCHD/Stream. MF assist is really nice I think, it temporarily zooms in automatically in stills mode, but tragically, not movie mode. Pressing the center button gives takes the zoom from 8.6x to 17x for micro-fine peepling. You can't get the histogram in movie mode, but can in stills. You can get the electronic level before and during recording in movie mode if you need it.You can use ISO1600, 1/60th and f/1.8 and a bit of NR in post to get decent dark indoor film shots. Variable aperture means zooms wide open will change in brightness, but it's smart and if you set the aperture at all above max it holds it during zoom. In-camera NR settings didn't seem to affect video but I didn't test much. Movie mode is available in most mode dial settings but most likely you'll just want to use the movie mode. There are three memory positions, not terribly fast to access like the 5D3, and they don't save things like Peaking on/off. They do save Steadyshot on/off, and other things.In image review you can toggle the zoom rocker to zoom in on the shot you just took without pressing play, and it brings you right in for a pixel peep to check sharpness which is nice. The big manual control ring has a long throw but no hard stops, and it can take some wrenching to go from macro to infinity. No setting available to tweak that. In playback you can use the zoom rocker too, and while zoomed, turning the value wheel skips you forward or back an image.Self-portrait mode is clever for timer shots, it just waits until you are in the image, and seeing your face, it shoots every 3 sec until you leave the picture. Speed priority continuous shooting is very fast but the card I had (transcend class 10) only let it take a half dozen-odd shots before buffer stall. I tried a 95MB/sec UHS-1 Sandisk Extreme Pro card to see if that does run faster here, and no, it does not run faster than the Transcend class 10 in the RX100. No spare batteries, no DAM RAW support yet, no external battery charger, it's the bleeding edge here in July 2012, by fall those should all be sorted. I ordered a USB portable li-ion charger thing (Anker 10KmAh) which works (with Sony's USB cable, not Anker's) but only when powered off. Battery life is meh, but it's small OK. Note that the play button will turn the camera on just like the power button (is that a bug?), so you might lose battery (and uh-oh, even have the lens extend with two presses) if you don't protect the play button in your pocket.Sound recording is fine enough internally, no control or i/o. Zoom happens slower and quieter when filming. Shutter noise is low in general, not much OIS noise. ? button doubles as trash icon...not sure why those labels weren't reversed, delete is much more common than the superficial help that screen provides.You can record 29:50 continuously at 60p. The camera is warm to the touch after that time in a 70F room but not hot. You can fit five of those shots on a 32GB card (roughly 2.5hours of 60p). I am annoyed the USA version camera doesn't shoot 50p (which would conform better to 24p @1/50th) yet has the European 29 minute video restriction...you would think it would be one way or the other.Anyway those are my random thoughts after 24 hours shooting with this cute thing.

I love my gear almost as much as my photographs.  I am also not easy to please, given my other two kits are a 5D Mark II and an OM-D E-M5.This camera produces the best image files (by a country mile) of any camera remotely close to this size.  ISO 125-400 is definitely the sweet spot for the little guy and with enough light, i.e. outdoor shots, the resolution rivals the 5D II.  I know that sounds crazy but it is true.  Sony hit a home run with the lens / sensor combo.Keep in mind, it cannot perform miracles in low light or for fast moving subjects.  Also anything above 800 ISO starts to look a little rough, although I have not had a chance to play with the RAW files in LR4 (waiting for adobe to release an update).  The f/1.8 is only available at the very widest focal length but it is still very helpful to have, and f/4.9 is not terrible for the long end.  The focus is quick and accurate. Colors and Metering are also great.The only feasible addition that would have made the RX100 even better and warranted a 5-star rating would have been touchscreen focus and touch shutter release.  Changing focus points is not hard, but that would have made the camera even more transparent.  I cannot understand why Sony did not include this given the touch focus already exists on the NEX-5n. I guess they are saving some tricks for the next generation.Also, the size takes a little getting used two.  It's TINY!!!! This is great for pocketing the camera but not as great for keeping it steady.  I will also say the in-body stabilization on the OM-D is much better than the Steady-shot on the Sony RX-100.  Still, it definitely helps.Overall, the RX100 makes a great, easily pocketable camera for sightseeing, landscapes and well lit conditions.  Thinner DOF is much more attainable than any previous ultra compact.  It performs admirably in lower light conditions, given what it is; a camera that is credit card sized and ways next to nothing.  I humiliates the likes of the S100, LX5, etc.  Just don't expect to get the performance in low light that you can get from a larger sensor (M43, APS-C, FF) and brighter, bigger glass.Thanks for reading, hope this is helpful.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A point and shoot that's barely a compromise", "Author": "Stephen A.

I found that as a casual user despite the features and detachable lens capability I just didn't want to carry a camera bag around with me everywhere.

Goes fine in a jacket though.Flash-Not that the flash doesn't work, but it's a popup that's right where your left index finger will sit when taking shots. A little annoying.Charging-No external charger for the battery, really Sony? I have to plug in the camera to charge a battery? What if I want to leave one charging while I'm out and about?Other than that it's hard to find fault with this camera. It takes better pics than a camera this size has any business taking.

Did not regret the decision even the slightest.  Aside from all those technical wonders mentioned by the 100 positive reviews before me, here is why the little camera did it for me:1. Easy auto modes - I'm not a photographer or even an enthusiast, but I like to see whatever photo I take come out good (in this camera's case, exceptional) with the least amount of fidgeting.2. Compact - Knowing myself, I would probably consider even the NEX too cumbersome to take around which would end up collecting dust. This camera fits in my pants pocket, though it does leave a pretty big bulge once in there.3. Sensitive - For a point and shoot, the low light performance is just crazy good.  It's perfect to catch my active three-year-old even in nighttime events. No, really, I mean it. Crazy good (though within reason).4. Video - 1080P 60 FPS video is almost as good in low light as the camera is when taking pictures. I took videos of fireworks with smooth, clear results. Also, while recording your video, you can zoom in/out *and* take 17 mpix stills at the same time!5. Ease of manual focus - Auto focus, while fast, sometimes doesn't get the right spots. The ring at the front for manual focus does a phenomenal job with peaking. Though I sometimes wish the camera would read my mind on what I would like to focus on so I can always catch those spontaneous moments... One can dream, right? ;) *Update Sep 14 - DMF focus mode + Center focus area work almost 100% of the time for me now.6. Flash - I never had a habit of using the flash because I had always thought they felt more detrimental to the picture with than without. The flash on this camera can be tilted to shoot at the ceiling and give a more natural feel while used indoors. It makes the flash on this camera a pleasure to use.As for all those complaints about RAW conversion and stuff - it doesn't matter to me as I'm perfectly content with the JPEG pictures.That said, what I don't really like are:1. Probably my own problem since my hands sweat so much, but it's really easy to leave nasty fingerprint smudges on the metal chassis.2. That USB cover is really flimsy-feeling and I fear for its longevity.3. No flip screen makes self-photos hard, which I like to take.4. Processing time after taking each photo is a little too long for my liking.  Has occasionally costed me the opportunity to take another shot right after the first one.  This is from ONLY using auto and scene modes.  I haven't tried more manual modes yet so that may be better as I learn more about the little thing. *Update Sep 14 - Learned that manual modes that don't require heavy image processing save pictures almost instantaneously. Check comments for details.I also purchased CaseLogic TBC-302 and JOBY GorillaPod Micro 250. With the latter placed in the former's front pocket, the camera fits the case well, although you do need to take care when zipping up the case. Some may fear the zipper may accidentally scratch the chassis, but in my few days of use it has not left a single noticeable mark.Anyway, I know a lot of people say \"this is a camera for photographers to have as a second camera to their DSLR,\" but I would also strongly recommend this camera to those like me, who don't own a DSLR but like to easily take amazing photos anywhere, anytime (and don't mind the price tag).", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Replaced my NEX with this/ 5D mark iii owner", "Author": "Logan", "ReviewID": "R16YBU1XPPYQX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Canon 5D mark iii and am a professional shooter. When I want to do personal photo's, I want a smaller camera to carry around that's not DSLR size. I went with the Sony NEX series, thinking this would solve this problem. It did not. I still had to carry around a bag with lenses and the tele lenses were long. The non tele lenses were still too big to put it comfortably in my laptop bag, which goes anywhere I go. I ended up selling the NEX on ebay, as I never used it. I could not justify the near $1700 dollars worth of NEX equipment I had in this small bag. I never felt like bringing it. And the picture quality was good, but not what I expected for having to bring extra lenses.I then went with the Sony RX-100. I needed a compact camera to solve this problem, but I needed one that shoots raw. I am a lightroom user. To my surprise, the images were better than what I assumed they might be. The video was stunning for a compact camera. I love the way the video looks. Although I can't put an ND filter on it, like I did with the nex. I don't really use a compact camera for professional use anyway, so I don't care if the shutter speed jumps a little in daylight in video mode. I realize you can put an ND filter over it, but that ruins it being a compact camera that I can have anywhere. I don't want extra accessories over it. Not even a case. I want to pull it out of my bag and use it.I put a 128GB sd card in it, which is always in it. Incase I see something I want to take video of that ends up lasting a long time. I also carry two 32GB cards in the bag incase the 128GB becomes corrupt. The rest of the SD cards I keep with my Canon 5D as it takes SD and CF cards.I also bought the wall/car charger for it, that came with 3 off brand batteries. These off brand batteries work just as good as the Sony battery that came with it. I can charge in the wall and charge one inside the camera via USB at the same time.If you are a pro shooter, looking for something that you can carry around that shoots raw and produces good images and video. This camera is great.The only con I have with it, is the HDMI port is on the bottom. You can't put it on a tripod and then hook the HDMI cable to it. I wanted this feature because I have an external monitor beside my computer. I wanted to plug it in via HDMI so I could see it recording me and make sure I'm in the frame. But I have to guess if I'm in frame when I'm recording a video of myself doing a tutorial video.The new version of this camera has the HDMI output in the right place. But it cost more, and honestly, for my use it is not worth more than this price. As I will just go to my pro rig when things get too expensive.It's not for people who want to shoot a ton of telephoto. But I am not a telephoto guy most of the time. I shoot a lot of wide angle landscapes and just general video.I recommend this camera. I would not get the mark ii version of this camera, unless you do not have a professional rig and this is your only camera. If this is a second camera, this one does fine. For example, the new version has a hot shoe. I do not want my compact camera to have a hot shoe because the idea is for it to be compact. I don't want to attach accessories onto my compact camera. That is my entire purpose for having a professional camera such as my 5D mark iii.The smaller the better for this case.

Image quality and pocket-ability. It fits both criteria very well.The lens is sharp, while having some major distortion at the edges compared to the LX5 I own. It is faster and with much better DOF control than is available on the LX5 though, so that helps. On the long end of the zoom, it's barely passable as it has so much in focus that you cannot tell its even got aperture control. Sony would do well to have a max aperture lens that is around F2.8 - F3.2 on the long end for the next round of this lens.The body is sturdy, albeit with plastic bits where there should be metal. The fit and finish is nicely done, although I found it a little slick to hold. Have applied gaffers tape where my fingers touch/hold it. As mentioned, the flash is pretty flimsy feeling, though it offers the ability to use a finger to tilt it back and bounce the flash. That part of the flash is very cool for a P&S.; Well done Sony for innovation.The sensor and resulting image quality are quite frankly, astounding for a P&S.; If like me, you want the IQ that comes from an APS-C sized sensor and lens combo, this is as close as you will get in any P&S;, IMO. Since I wanted the best available images, this is very pleasing to me. There are a slew of fun to use image effects and they actually look pretty good in some cases. The painted image is one I like (see the portrait of the girl in the gallery, with a before and after).Lastly, it goes in my pants pocket and is only marginally larger than my iphone with a case on it.This is the camera the new LX7 will be struggling against IMO. However, with an F1.4 - F2.3 lens that covers about the same range as the RX100, I would guess that you can get better looking images from the long end of the LX7. ??

So you go to the web site, and you will find a manual which you can \"view\".  But there is no PDF of a full manual which you can Download. They do include a 31 page mini manual. I don't find this  very helpful or thoughtful to customers...especially since the RX100 is full of features, many of which are not intuitive.Some examples:  \"Clear Image Zoom\" - this is apparently intuitive to the user!

This has the effect of disabling certain functions such as metering mode, and the Autofocus seletion square.Auto Port.

Despite mostly being left on \"green idiot mode\", the RX100 typically produced far better JPEGs than the $3500 Canon, regardless of what exposure was used on the Canon. The long lenses of the Canon were better for wildlife, of course, but I came to rely on the little Sony for scenery and also for its built-in panorama mode.

Should you walk around outside in hot humid conditions, then step into an air-conditioned space like a restaurant or your hotel - or home - moisture is likely to condense inside the camera. Do this several times daily and before long the camera can fail and the failure will not be covered under warranty. My new RX-100 lasted two months in SE Asia and went completely dead. It was never dropped, exposed to rain or in any way \"abused.\" An authorized Sony repair shop here in Thailand where I bought it has quoted $220 to repair the camera because it was \"broken by water.\" And guess what? As soon as it is working, it will be vulnerable to the exact same failure again.Note that moving from time spent in the cold into a hot environment would tend to cause condensation on the outside surface of a hollow object that had reached thermal equilibrium at the lower temperature. There are temperature/humidity specifics that determine whether or not condensation will actually occur.Sony knows there is a potential problem with the camera because they briefly mention cold, heat and humidity in the user manual. (There are manufacturing techniques that would essentially eliminate this issue but would probably increase the camera price beyond a viable sale point.) They do NOT say how the user is supposed to know harmful condensation has occurred inside the camera body (not the lens), or how to avoid the problem recurring, nor do they provide anything really more than a vague warning. My lens did not fail, the electronics did. Clearly this should be a listed concern, but there is nothing of practical value Sony can say about it beyond worrying the new owner. And, obviously, they will not mention this topic in their marketing materials.So, depending upon where you intend to use the camera, be advised high humidity and warm operating conditions can lead to expensive, out-of-warranty failure.

Nearly every review hailed the RX100 as the best compact camera available today. I do photography as a hobby and like to carry a general purpose camera everywhere with me.I have previously owned a Canon S100 but sold it due to underwhelming performance and an E18 lens error. I rarely use my DSLR anymore and figured a solid compact camera I could take anywhere would encourage me to take more photos.  I've been using the RX100 for a couple of months and here are my impressions so far:Pros:-Image Quality: I've owned roughly a dozen compact cameras over the last six years including an S100, several Panasonic travels zooms,  a Sony HX9V, Nikon P100, etc. They're all had their pluses but in terms of overall image quality (especially low light), the RX100 blows them all out of the water. Photos taken at 1600 ISO are perfectly usable; something I would never have thought with a compact. Overall, images look great!-Build quality:  The camera exudes quality. It feels solid and well built. Hopefully it will last for years and be reliable.-Ergonomics: I have large hands and the camera feels comfortable to hold and use. I ordered a Richard Franiec grip because at times the camera felt a bit slippery. The buttons are small but that has never really been a problem.-Screen: the screen is sharp and reasonably bright although I found it slightly too dim in direct sunlight. There is a mode to boost the brightness however.-Customization: I like the ability to customize some of the keys on the back. Also, you are able to customize the menu of the Fn button for frequently used settings making it easy to change things like metering mode and focus points on the fly.-Video: the video quality is great. The camera records in stereo. Zoom and AF are available while shooting.-Battery: battery life is good, not great. However, I do appreciate that a genuine Sony battery is around $30; very reasonable in my book. My old Panasonic took $50 genuine batteries. You can always go third party as well and I am sure there are plenty of fine choices.-Autofocus: the AF is very fast and reasonably accurate. No complaints in this department.-Flash: the flash itself is average and I never really use it. What is nice however, is the ability to bounce the flash. It really does work in some situations and is a nice compromise to a full flash.-Display modes: Sony has a nice way of showing basic shot info in a black bar at the bottom of the screen during shooting; no overlaying icons on your image. You can see more info but this is a nice, uncluttered way of displaying shutter speed, aperture, EV, and ISO.Cons:-Control ring: the control ring is a great way to change functions and the RX100's ring has a nice weighty resistance but it just takes too long to go through settings. Say you're in aperture priority mode and you want to change from f/1.8 to f/8 you have to sit there turning the ring far too many times. It just isn't sensitive enough. I ended up disabling the ring and just using the control wheel on the back of the camera. I am sure this is something they could change with a firmware/software update in the future.-Macro focusing: at times the camera struggles to focus up close at 28mm even past the minimal distance.-Playback: videos and images are stored in separate folders. This seems like a really awkward way to organize files. Also, when you zoom during playback it defaults to 100% as opposed to starting incrementally from 0% zoom. Small, but these two things really annoy me.-Charging: I buy the argument that in-camera charging is convenient but I would have preferred an external charger so I can charge extra batteries on a trip. This somehow seems like cost cutting on Sony's part and is an unfortunate trend among many cameras these days.-No 24p: not sure why this isn't an option but it would have been nice to have. Again, something I hope they can add later with a firmware/software update.Power saver: some RX100 owners are reporting that their batteries are draining even when the camera is not in use. One hypothesis is that the playback button (which powers on the LCD and not the camera) will get pressed in a pocket or bag and drain the battery. It was also discovered that if the camera detects any movement the power saver feature will not work. This has happened to me one when the camera was in my backpack and I found that the battery had drained overnight. Not the end of the world but potentially frustrating - carry an extra battery!-Price: yes it's hard to criticize the price when no other camera combines this IQ in such a small package but I would have liked this to be priced under $600. I'm sure the price will creep down eventually though.Neutral:-Size: this camera produces amazing images considering the size. That being said, it is a tad too big to fit comfortably in a jeans pocket (at least the front pockets).-I sometimes find myself wishing for a 24mm wide lens instead of 28mm. Maybe on the next version.-Battery door: yes most compact cameras have a cheap battery door. This is particularly bad. It is not spring loaded so it does not pop up when slid open and seems to have a tendency to slide open on its own. As long as it does not break I don't really care but it seems incongruous with how the rest of the camera feels.-Manual: some people like a printed manual. I rarely use them and find them to be a waste of paper. I think Sony should have reached a compromise whereby RX100 owners could simply order a free printed manual online and others could access a PDF as needed.-? button: dedicating a button to a help menu seems silly. Sure, we all need a little help with a new camera at times but once you learn it, the button is pointless. Also, the camera is clearly aimed at enthusiasts who probably don't need to know how to \"use a flash\" and \"adding effects\".People will always find something to criticize or complain about. The fact of the matter is that with a camera you simply need to choose the one that will serve your needs the best. In this case the RX100 does a better job more of the time than any other compact camera for my purposes.Yes, it is expensive and yes, there are some annoying aspects.

However, most of the time it will come with me in my bag instead.  Since it tightly fits in my pocket now, I don't expect it to fit in my pocket when I get the leather case which comes with the camera a month later (out of stock for now).  I had also considered buying m4/3 and NEX, but what's the point?  GF5, for instance, is 362g with the 14-42mm X lens (f/3.5-5.6) attached while RX100 is 240g.  Comparing the two using equivalent aperture of 35mm (full frame), at the wide end RX100 is around 1-stop faster (f/4.9 vs f/7), while at 84mm RX100 is less than 1/3 f-stop slower (f/11.2 vs f/12.25).  I do not and cannot own all different kinds of cameras for testing, but according to what I see from review sites taking sample photos of the SAME object, I will say that GF5 with the kit 14-24mm X lens produces picture very close to but not as sharp as RX100, particularly at ISO 1600 and onward.RX100's boot and shutdown is around 3 seconds each.  Wide angle at 28mm f/1.8 is really amazing, especially that it also have pretty short minimum focus range (roughly 10cm).  Telephoto, on the other hand, is a bit weaker at 100mm f/4.9 with a not so great minimum focus range of around 60cm (rough measurement again).  Even though the camera is having f/1.8 as the fastest aperture, it goes up very quickly to f/2.0 when the focal length just go up 1mm from the widest; However, it keeps itself in f/4 until going pass 66mm, which is fine and is much better than many lenses already.  The picture quality is very good (bokeh is pretty nice), and I see its \"usable\" high ISO is 1600, which is prefect for outdoor activities but a bit lacking for indoors.  I must admit that I am fascinated by the fact that the lens used in RX100 is \"Carl Zeiss\" : not really produced by Zeiss I know, but at least they are \"involved\", and I am sold by the T* coating.  Perhaps that's also why it performs better as I'd mentioned above?The flash can be tilted up manually as a bounce fill-in flash, though I have to go through the menu instead of using a shortcut button to activate the flash.  This is also a very important feature for me to choose it over Fuji X10.  With the 4GB card installed, the camera reports that it has capacity to store around 160 photos in RAW and JPEG (small).  I generally shot my photos in RAW for archive but upload JPEG to Facebook directly instead of using LR4 to convert and upload, hence my settings preference.  I have no idea about its battery performance, but it should be adequate for one-day use in my case.  The camera takes Micro USB for charging and comes with a 1.5A@5V USB charger, and it seems that I can charge it by my computer.  However, computer USB port generally supplies 500mA at most, which is 3 times lower than the charger, so I don't think it is a good way to recharge the camera.  Yet, using Micro USB, it means I can also use a more generic \"portable battery\" that works for many devices instead of buying a spare battery, though it may seems more bulky.  Perhaps the only missing feature I also wanted is GPS, or the ability to use cell phone as a GPS device.

I lost that camera while on vacation, and replaced it with the Sony RX100.  This Sony is my favorite camera ever.The RX100 menus, and customizable buttons and dials, seem to provide much better access to functions than does the S100.  I use the movable spot focus a lot.  Sony allows you to assign that function to a specific botton, for quick access.  Maybe the S100 does as well, but I never found a way to do it.  Instead, I had to go through several button clicks to get to the movable focus spot.  While the S100 did allow you to link the movable focus spot and the spot meter, the RX100 does not seem to have a movable spot meter, linkable to the focus spot or not; it's fixed in the center.  But it does allow easy AE lock, again by assigning that function to a specific botton.  I'm sure I never learned the S100 as well as it can be learned, but I've had this Sony for less than a week, and I already feel more control over my picture taking than I did with the S100.The autofocus is great.  Really, really sharp.  Overall, I'm very happy with IQ, from focus, to exposure, to low light performance.On the downside, the camera is a bit slow to start up, and even slower to shut down.  It is slow in writing images to the SD card.  But for speed from click to capture, it's been great.UPDATE -- 8/15: Just returned from vacation.  This camera did not disappoint.  The controls allowed me to set the camera as I wished quickly and easily. I especially like using the center spot meter to lock the exposure as I wanted, then to use the movable focus point to focus on my intended subject.

However, the Sony RX100 takes this to a level never seen before.This camera is really small; about the size of the Canon s90/s95/s100 series (and smaller than other premium compact cameras like the Panasonic LX5) with a sensor size never previously seen in a pocket-sized camera. In addition, the lens at wide angle (28mm equivalent) has a maximum aperture of f/1.8This camera takes excellent photographs under almost all lighting conditions.  The automatic white balance does a better job than any other camera in this price range.  Exposure and metering are also very good even outdoors under highly contrasted conditions.  The AF is quick but does get it wrong once in a while under dim lighting conditions.  The picture quality rivals good entry level DSLR cameras even at higher ISO settings.  Photographs taken at ISO 1600 are noise free and cleaner than photographs taken with any other pocket camera at ISO 400.  Close examination reveals some loss of detail at higher ISO settings presumably from some type of noise reduction being applied.Obviously the small size of the camera imposes physical constraints on the inclusion of dedicated buttons and the size of included controls when compared to a larger camera.  Many of the buttons may be customized. However, the portability/photograph quality combination is unmatched by any other camera ever sold.THE LCD screen is very bright and sharp.  The screen in default view displays al of the key settings (albeit rather small).  An optical viewfinder would have been a welcome inclusion like the Canon G series (and the Nikon P7xxx series) as the LCD is difficult to see in sunlight.The flash is a little weak (and there is no hot shoe for an external flash). However, the flash is movable and can be positioned with your thumb to create a \"bounce\" effect like most external flash units for a much nicer flash effect.  Again, the flash output is weak and the bounce weakens it even more so 'bouncing' the flash is really only practical at wide angle where the aperture is very wide.Why only 4 stars?  The price is simply too high for a compact camera (and Sony is old school; they do not let resellers discount the list price) especially one with disappointing build quality and no instruction guide (not even on CD) or software for Raw conversion or even a battery charger (the battery can be charged while it is inside the camera).

And now have a Sony NEX 7 and a3000 (the a3000 is a second body).  I also have and enjoyed the Canon G12 (an great camera when first sold).  So I know the variables.Let me post the following as a guide: if you don't already own a suite of lenses, then don't be misled when someone says something like: this costs $500-650 (the new II cost $750) - you can buy a mirror-less camera for that.  Well that's true.  but by the time you buy a few lenses you have spent $2000 so the real cost is something else.  And even if you own lenses, most of the newer cameras do significant camera processing and so you are better off with a lens built for your camera (to the pros- please don't argue, i know you spend your day with Lightroom, but the rest of us don't).  so even if you have lenses, the new mirror less may not really work well with your lenses, so in the end your $500-700 camera will cost $2000.So to the person who wants a better sensor than the typical point and shoot, this one will amaze and impress.  Yes it will!.  And unless you really want to lug a camera bag with you on vacation (you do? ) then this will do most of what you could ever want without the bag.  So when you've climbed on top of the mountain, or when your boat finally has gotten out to the whales, you can slip this out of a pocket (coat pocket, cargo pocket - it may be a tad to big for jeans pockets).  and you are set.I want to comment on flash and low light.  Both are specialties.  If you want a better sensor AND want to take flash pictures - sorry, you may need to use a larger camera AND a separate flash.  And by the way, i took flash pix at night in a church and did fine. but the camera may be slow to recharge.  But remember, this is a tiny package.I took my NEX 7 on vacation last September, and though happy with the pictures, changing lenses on the mountain is tricky unless you are a professional.

This is a better buy.", "Author": "Neil Huang", "ReviewID": "R2YPKLU0FXDL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera already has enough reviews about the specs and performance. I'll leave that out, but I'll share my experience of it as a casual photographer.As I get more exposure into photography, I start to learn about many photographs elements. I was pretty much thinking about upgrading to a DSLR after having played around with a superzoom, and learning that sometimes sensor size can cause a big difference. I also heard the phrase that the camera doesn't make the photo, it's just a tool for the photographer. I realize that, but I wanted a better tool than a 1/2.3' sensor size superzoom that would be more versatile for indoor and portraits. Also, I was a sucker for nice DOF effects, which is hard on a small sensor camera.Before looking at this P&S;, I almost was going to jump into buying my first DSLR (a used 5D) for about the same price as I would have gotten this camera. Then I realized as a casual photographer who's interested in taking good pictures, it is a heavy investment in cameras to just be able to take casual photos that look nice. For me, I made the realization that if I choose to go down the DSLR route, I may just go around shooting with the \"kit lens\" that comes w/ whichever DSLR camera that I buy, if any, maybe one more lens that is +1 compared to the kit lens. It doesn't make sense.Moreover, I am starting to believe the phrase \"The best camera you have is the camera you have with you\". From speaking with other casual photographers like myself who own DSLRs, they more than often leave their cameras at home because it's too much gear and too heavy to lug around. This camera is the best camera to have with me when I go places. It takes great pictures, esp when I'm with others who don't have their DSLRs with them when we hang out.Since the 2 most important features I need as a casual photographer are low light capabilities for taking in door portraits and making professional looking photographs with DOF, this camera fits the bill w/o breaking the bank (comparing to buying a DSLR + lenses, of course). It's not cheap, but it gives me a sense of satisfaction to know that I can take just as good looking photos as I continue to hone my skill w/o having the temptation to spend money on gears that I will probably use only once or twice before letting them sit on the shelves collecting dust.In the future if I do decide that I've learned enough to really want to invest in a DSLR, this camera will STILL be a first choice for me to take around as it is pocketable. That's also a reason for me to get this camera first, learn more about photography, before deciding whether or not I really need a DSLR. At this time, the answer is no, but it may change.If you are a pro, or want to be like a pro, then this review won't be useful to you. However, if you are a casual photographer wanting to learn to take better looking pictures with a better tool, this camera will be a great choice for you, over buying a APS-C camera with a kit lens.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera for the returning enthusiast, light traveler, or shy shutterbug", "Author": "GoNoFurther", "ReviewID": "RV6VVEFIY4FJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony DSC-RX100 has been extensively reviewed here and elsewhere by amateurs, enthusiasts, and professionals alike. I have discovered no un-reported features and tend to agree with the many, many positive comments that have been made while sharing little enthusiasm for the few criticisms that have been levied.  Repeating what others have said would therefore seem as tedious as it would be pointless. Like most, I have found the Sony RX100 to be fast, small, easy to use, highly customizable (RAW + JPEG, manual modes, all the most modern shooting modes), well crafted, and capable of producing images of very high quality.What I will try to articulate is perhaps a fresh perspective on this wonderful camera, particularly for those who travel, who like to shoot without drawing a lot of attention to themselves, or who are recently returned to serious photography, which I define as shooting with an eye towards attaining high quality images. Once a long time ago I fancied myself an enthusiast. I owned a Nikon FM2 equipped with fast 28, 50, and 105 mm fixed length Nikor lenses, shooting a variety of conditions and subjects with low ISO, consumer-grade Kodak and Agfa print and slide film. But during grad school - what I now call the \"lean years\" - I needed money and sold the whole setup. I married soon thereafter, had a couple of kids and, being settled, needed to capture those precious moments. So my wife and I bought, kept, discarded, or replaced a whole series of point-and-shoots, first film, then digital, as well as an early 6.2 MP Canon DSLR with a 28-150 or so Canon zoom, which we still have. My wife did most of the picture taking and the cameras were mostly of her choosing.As time progressed my growing contempt for fuzzy, facebook-quality images, iPhone cameras, our collection of point and shoots, and my wife's Canon (nice, but I swear like 5 lbs) grew until I decided to purchase a camera of my own. But what to buy? Paramount would be the ability to acquire high quality images - rich, accurate colors, high resolution, RAW and JPEG formats, and nice dynamic range - using the smallest possible package. To me photography is a very conspicuous process where the degree of conspicuousness is driven by the perceived complexity and size of the rig used to shoot. Lug that DLSR with a massive zoom lens supported by its own monopole to the Little League game and you'll get first class images. But the other parents are thinking \"picture guy\" and if you turn it in their direction they'll duck and cringe. Take what is perceived as a point-and-shoot - sure, sure, not the equivalent but... - and people will assume you have point-and-shoot motivations and ignore you. And, while it is beyond dispute that no point-and-shoot (including the RX100) can rival the best images that that same DSLR can produce, it is also true that they are heavy and clumsy. Bulk and conspicuousness therefore have the paradoxical effect of rendering the equipment most capable of capturing fine images the very equipment I am least likely to haul out take some snaps or pack for a long trip to Europe.Now the RX100. Very inconspicuous - you can take it anywhere and everyone seems relaxed because who doesn't like a snapshot, right? People ignore you - you're the dunce with the clown camera. Better still, you can put it on a lanyard, hang it around your neck, and carry it around in the breast pocket of a shirt - it looks like you've got your work badge and a pack of smokes in there. Its quick startup, rapid zoom, and easy mode setting do make it a great point and shoot but it's extremely capable of more thoughtful composition, though no one is the wiser. I find myself taking it places I would never take our big Canon DSLR. How about that trip to Europe? Do I really want to drag a DSLR and three lenses around while floating down the canals of Venice? I lived in Europe for years and humped that Nikon SLR setup from one end of the then free world to the other. Once, while changing lenses at Checkpoint Charlie during 1985, when the East Germans were rebuilding it and it was being guarded by loads of Germans and Russians wandering about, I accidentally strayed onto THEIR side and was nearly apprehended at the point of an AK-47. The RX100 features a nice zoom (no need for that 28, 50, and 105 anymore - adios East German border guard dudes), good light gathering ability, and an extremely compact, balanced wrapper. Like other compact, fixed lens systems the advantages conferred by small size and simplicity simply overwhelm the DSLR when it comes to light travel and inconspicuousness.And image quality? I would say I'm at a loss for words but I've saved a few. Marvelous. Superior. Rich. Sharp. Surprisingly good. Side by side comparisons with my wife's Canon DSLR show better resolution and only a slight loss of dynamic range. I'm not thrilled with the macro, which seems to produce images that are kind of creamy and a bit too soft for my taste, but at normal focal lengths the images are impressive and crisp. Depth of field de-focusing by using a wide-open aperture is for crap unless you're taking pictures of stuff a couple of feet away, but that's a small camera tradeoff that cannot be contravened by the laws of physics. Through cropping and close examination of RX100 photos I've taken at all apertures, focal lengths, ISOs, and speeds I see what others more perceptive than me have seen: dense detail, sharpness, a bit of softness around the corners depending on focal length, excellent colors, and a lot to work with in iPhoto, Aperture, Photoshop, or Lightroom. I was frankly stunned at how good these little cameras have become.Alternative models? In the course of my research I learned a great deal about many that are highly regarded, but have tried none of them and therefore cannot endorse the RX100 as superior to any of them, though of course others have done so. What I can say is that if you're looking for a small, easily borne, highly capable, nicely designed camera that can take excellent images suited to post-processing, printing, and enlargement, then the RX100 is a very, very safe bet.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally, a small \"DSLR.\"", "Author": "J.

It truly takes much sharper pictures that are comparable to DSLRs, and because of the multi-shot \"aggregation\" feature, HDR features and panning panorama features, this Sony goes well beyond an everyday DSLR camera with a bright lens.

Sharp, detailed, good dynamic range. There are two issues I have with this camera, however. First off, it has a tendency to overexpose and clip highlights. Secondly, while it keeps noise at bay through ISO1600, it seems to do this through very aggressive noise reduction at ISO800 and beyond, taking a toll on fine detail. The Olympus XZ-2 on the other hand, has more noise at ISO800 but also more detail. Personally, I like cameras that retain fine detail better and don't mind a little noise. But to say that the RX100 is an open and shut case as far as IQ is concerned (when compared to its competitors)...not quite.I am not particularly thrilled about the F4.9 at the telephoto end but the lens has nice characteristics otherwise so I really don't see that as a negative overall. What is a negative overall is how long it takes for the lens to zoom in and out and it's loud when it does it.The autofocus performance on this camera is somewhat disappointing in low-light. It's fine in the daytime but in low-light it's almost as slow as the much less-expensive Powershot S100. Also I had issues with the image stabilization is not great on the camera for some reason. I found in a lot of instances that you had to hold onto the camera very tightly in order to get a blur-free shot. I think that is inexcusable for a $650 camera.Some people have commented on the battery life of this camera. It's not the greatest but that's one of the trade-offs you have to make with a small pocket camera. Your best bet is just to get an extra battery.The LCD screen on back is very nice being somewhat viewable in direct sunlight. The menu system on the camera is a very nice and more straight-forward than other Sony cameras that I've used. The dial up front doesn't have decisive clicks that the Powershot S100 has but it's still nice to have considering that some enthusiast cameras don't have it at all.Ergonomics-wise, I think this camera could use some improvement. The shiny metal body is slippery up front and could benefit from some sort of grip or textured surface to make the camera more secure in your hand.Video generally looks nice, I haven't tested it much. But it generally is sharp and the audio sounds good.I think the RX100 was a respectable first compact enthusiast camera for Sony. And indeed, it's remarkable they were able to take a relatively large sensor and put it in such a compact light-weight camera. It's image quality is a cut above any enthusiast compact out there. But it has some performance-related issues that need refinement. Not terrible, but it could have been better on a $650 camera.

I probably bought and returned 6 to 8 cameras over the years hoping that they would do it and they never could. Canon's Powershot S90/S95/S100 cameras were headed in the right direction but the sensor was too small for true low-light photography; same story with Panasonic's Lumix LX5/LX7 cameras. I thought Canon was going to pull it off with the huge sensor in the G1-X, but after shooting with it for 3 days it went back because it's too big, can't focus well, and has a crazy minimum focus distance problems which means you can never get close to subjects no matter how much you zoom in because as you zooom you have to back up so much that the shot was never actually any closer.This camera is incredible and changes the landscape of high-end point-and-shoots forever. My Nikon D7000 is an amazing camera but is now going on Ebay. While the RX100 might not be able to take pictures that are quite as good, and the smaller sensor definately has limitations, the point is that this camera has finally gotten \"close enough\" to make the trade-off worth it.

I hesitated for a while between the much cheaper and ill-reviewed little brother of the S95 (S100) and this expensive new sony RX100 which everybody has been praising.When I opened the box I was surprised by the weight of the camera. This thing is small but heavy like a brick. With so much mass, I don't think that the camera would survive a 3 feet fall! Props to the engineers, it's amazing that the entire Carl Zeiss lens can retract into the body of such a small camera. Other than that, the sony RX100 looks really slick and reminds me of a Leica (not that I ever had one). A German camera it is not yet. I was in fact hugely disappointed by the finish of the camera. The trap doors for the micro-USB connector and the HDMI micro jack are so flimsy that I think Sony just asked some interns to design them. It's also likely that Sony is looking forward to people sending their camera for repairs, or just hoping that they buy the RX200 next year. I guess if you have a lot of money to throw around on cameras then it shouldn't be an issue. For me the joke doesn't end here. The worst piece of design on this is the flash. When it popped out I just started laughing. It's a $650 point & shoot and yet it has the lousiest flash I have ever seen on any camera. It's just ridiculous. I went in the menu and disabled the flash. I also assigned the flash button to an ISO button. This way I won't accidently pop it open and break this little piece of cr@p. Funny thing is, the manual advises people not to carry the camera by the flash unit. I guess everyone will have figured that by now.I read in many reviews that the RX100 was \"made in Japan\". Mine says \"Made in China\" and further investigation revealed that it's the case for every single RX100 that is on the market now. Thus, don't buy the sony RX100 because you think it's made in Japan. It seems to be something that sony did for the first batch of cameras knowing that the first reviewers would appreciate this detail.I then started to take some pictures out of my window and compared them to shots taken in parallel on my 6 years old entry-level Pentax 6M pixel DSLR equipped with a 18-55 lens from Sigma. I was less than impressed by the dynamic range and the colors on the Sony RX100. I heard people saying that the RX100 was as good as some recent DSLR. At first I seriously doubted it based on the test landscape shots I took. The colors were rather bland and the clouds overexposed although it was still early morning. Sure you can zoom in or crop the pictures taken on the Sony like crazy and get a better resolution than you would on a 6M pixel camera but this sony doesn't replace a DSLR when it comes to dynamic range.A few days later, I must admit that my opinion has changed a bit. You just need to figure out what this camera is good for. I started taking a variety of pictures and am now quite impressed. The sensor is very sensitive and the noise more than acceptable. I have shot many evening pictures in B&W; and in color without flash at ISO3200 and am very satisfied with the results. The sony RX100 is indeed much better at this than my canon S95 or my Pentax ist DL2 DSLR. To be honest, it actually kills both cameras in this respect. Not sure how someone experienced with more recent DSLRs would feel about the ISO performance but I find it great. The shooting speed is also a big plus. I enjoy the movie mode as well. You can change the aperture and (slightly) throw the background out of focus which makes a huge difference with the canon S95 and almost every other point and shoot. I would not recommend zooming in and out while you shoot since the results aren't very smooth but overall the RX100 is quite good for shooting movies.One thing that I don't like is that several of the functions and modes are not compatible. For example shooting HDR and setting a timer while I have the camera on a tripod is not an option. This seems totally illogical to me and I don't understand why I can't do both to make sure that there's no camera shake. I do enjoy being able to set the camera to B&W; and shoot a movie. This wasn't possible on the S95 for example. Still, I wish you could combine more modes and effects. Sony might release a software update but I wouldn't bet on it. They are probably too busy whipping their interns for the lousy trap door and flash design.That's about it for now. I have been shooting for about a week and am still having fun with the RX100. The camera is amazing for a point and shoot. Considering that I paid $400 for the S95 a year ago, I would say that the steep price of the RX100 is totally justified considering the difference in performance. Paradoxically, I can't help feeling that the RX100 is a bit overrated. It's not as good as a DSLR like some would like to pretend. I also really can't look past the fact that Sony decided to cut corners on the final design. I am really scared that I am going to break it within a year, especially when I get familiar with it and start being less careful opening trap doors and such.

I seldom used a flash and when I did usually went straight back to using available light to capture warmer colors.

The biggest reason to get this compact, and what you are actually paying for. I've tried a lot of compact cameras, and most of them only get decent quality at ISO 80. I felt this was true even on the S95 which I used prior to this model. The RX100 is great quality all the way to ISO 800, and is passable at 1600. I feel like this is the greatest thing about this camera.2. Bounce Flash. I like to use an external flash on my 5D2, and I bounce it for better results. I love that the RX100 has a flash that pops up, and you can actually hold it back with your finger to bounce it. Produces much better results.3. Good Lens. I'm impressed with the built-in lens. At low F-stop it has decent bokeh. The sensor is big enough that you can shoot at F1.8 at ISO 80-400 and still crop for good results.4. Good Software.

Also for those wondering my camera was made in China, not Japan.  I wish I had ordered one of the early models from Japan before the quality dropped.  I have used Sony cameras for over twelve years and never experienced this kind of issue.  The camera hold wonderful potential that is destroyed by a basic fault.Update  Nov 7, 2012I called Sony to see if they could resolve the issue and after three transfers and thirty minutes wait they agreed that it was either a faulty battery or a shorted circuit in the camera draining the battery.  They advised they would ship me a new battery, but they were on backorder until Dec 7.  I declined the offer as by then my 30 day return to Amazon would have expired.  I completed a return to Amazon and hey presto they responded by offering a replacement camera delivered the following day.  Now that is what I call Customer Service!! You rock Amazon!!  I have been working with the camera for over a week now and it is working well and is still working off the initial charge with no problems.  I love the camera and have moved rating up to three stars and hope to be able to move it higher based on ongoing good experiences.

How good is it?  Relative to its tiny size, it's excellent.  If you have a S90/95/100 or something similar and want better quality in an equally small camera, it's here.  The RX100 is better in just about every way.  But when somebody says \"As soon as my little Sony arrived I unloaded my Nikon D800 SLR, ah....no.There are so many features and the instructions are close to nonexistent so a quick summary based on what I've found so far.  20 megapixels may/may not be necessary but picture quality is impressive for such a small camera.  As the tests at Imaging Resource showed things are a bit soft in the corners at the wide setting, but not that bad.  Usable wide open and best around f/4.5.  At the long end, the lens is fine everywhere, right from wide-open.  Am I pixel peeping?  Yes, and if this was a $139 Casio camera I would agree it's unjustified.  But it isn't, and therefore it is.I like the Sony interface and have no problems with the ring, except that its flush with the bottom of the camera so in the unlikely event you use a tripod, you may not be able to turn the ring (yes, this happened).  Dynamic range could be better, which is a shame but to be fair, only Fuji has really extended dynamic range.  I tried the various options and only the HDR really compresses the range but of course you need a stationary camera and subject to take advantage.  By the way, it does a great job with in-camera HDR; I thought it looked more realistic than my Canon 5D3 HDRs.  Video was a snap and looked great to me (I know nothing about shooting movies).Without going into things that obviously the camera doesn't have, like a viewfinder, shoe or low price, here are my plusses and minuses.Pro:  Really small, lens sharp everywhere you'd expect, great interface, fast operation, only slightly confusing for a snapshot camera (Intelligent Auto vs. Superior Auto excepted), very low noise to ISO 400, completely usable at 800, lots of detail in files, multiple memories for saving settings, lots of well-implemented fun features with good on-screen explanations of what they doCon:  Camera's bottom bottom plate entirely plastic (ok), lens assembly entirely plastic (not ok), dynamic range typical of small sensor camera (similar situation with Canon G1X), LCD not visible in direct sun even with adjustment, no obvious way to protect front element, no grip (really needed with something this small), no meaningful instructions, large raw files a bit of a nuisance until decent software available.So, if your main requirement is a very small camera that can take very good photos, this is for you.  OTOH, if you're quality conscious enough to spend this much on a camera, you might want to get something a bit larger or wait for Photokina.Update - A few more observations having used the camera a bit more.  The Superior Auto mode does a fantastic job of reducing noise via multiple exposures, and the Handheld Twilight mode, with more exposures, is even better.  However, with these modes the camera locks the lens wide open so you gain a lot in reduced noise but you give up a little sharpness and a lot of depth of field.  Also, despite the large sensor, the camera still seems to be set up as a snapshot camera.  With jpegs, it over sharpens a lot, giving the typical halos.  You can almost eliminate this, while still taking advantage of the features that only work with jpegs by going to Menu - Creative Style and reducing the excessive sharpening, which really isn't needed with this camera.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Breathtaking image quality !", "Author": "Zeb \"zebra01\"", "ReviewID": "R31X4Y6IELEC6B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own very high end DSLR's and have tried the Canon S95 and s100.

I am sure things will change for other brands as this technology moves very quickly. The camera is beautifully made and is a joy to use.There is one thing that I dislike a whole lot is the charger - to charge the camera battery one must connect the charger to a USB cable to the camera - in camera battery charging.

It will start not responding to the zoom lever, the mode selector, the review switch, etc. I sent it for repair just before the warrantee expired, and they had to replace the master switch.

On December, 2012 the issues started again, and I have had to send it for repair again, now out of warrantee for around 120 dollars.So if you use this camera everyday, like I do, get an extended warranty from Sony because the switch is not built for heavy users.Since I am going on a trip, I have had to purchase another RX-100 (the M II).

Hard to believe a rinky-dink little camera could do so much. I found the auto HDR extremely valuable in dealing with difficult contrasty/dim lighting situations such as the inside of Cathedrals and castles.  The low light performance at the wide end was also astonishing.  There are indeed many pros for the this camera which are detailed in the other reviews here.  My biggest gripe of all?  The menu structure and user interface are simply terrible. This has got to be the least organized and least intuitive menu interface I've seen.  I think what has happened here is that the plethora of mode/function options has exponentially exploded in this camera while Sony tried to reduce the number of hard buttons at the same time. Everything is assignable, but you can get into trouble if you customize it too much.  For example, I assigned exposure compensation to the button that is default labeled drive mode/self timer.  Two months later when I actually needed to use the self-timer, I went into the menus looking for self-timer and could find no such menu item!  Frustrating minutes later, I looked under the menu item \"drive mode\" and finally found the \"self-timer\" function hidden there.  By this time, it was too late to use the self-timer function as the photo opportunity had passed. Sony could take some serious lessons from Canon when it comes to user friendliness of the UI. In short, this camera has a steep learning curve until you can quickly make it do what you want at a moments notice.

If this price is paltry to you, just buy the thing.  It is quite a feat of excellent engineering.I bought the RX100 from Amazon.  I'm impressed with Sony's innovations lately (Alpha, and NEX lines especially), and recently recommended a friend buy the WX150 model (and she is thrilled).  I had to return my RX100 for it suffered from a dust glob on the sensor (it may have come from the factory this way, but it did rear it's head on day 2 of ownership, the first time I shot outdoors).  As much as I was impressed with the 1080/60p video, I'm not sure the RX100's limited capabilities are going to fit my needs as being the only camera I'll use.So if you're looking to use this model as your only camera, you may also want either a wider angle (around 25mm) or a longer zoom.  Meaning you may also be considering DSLR/DSLT models and other mirrorless offerings such as NEX.  I'd suggest you get all 3 different systems and play with them to see what kind of compromises you're willing to live with -- problem is you may end up keeping the DSLR AND the RX100.  Perhaps one day your bank account will forgive you ;O)If you never print big, or know you'll never want to print big (over 8\"x10), I'd save some coin and first try the WX150.  Seriously.  Just don't pixel peep!The RX100 is an amazing tool, no doubt it delivers best in the hands of a serious enthusiast or pro, who are likely shooting in P/A/S/M modes.  Don't want to be a photog?  Don't know what P/A/S/M means?  Get the WX150.  I found the auto modes on the RX100 to deliver only OK images in all light conditions, but take some extra time using the P/A/S/M modes and your \"photography knowledge\" that's beyond the typical \"point & shoot crowd\" and you'll be amazed with your captures, especially considering the camera's diminutive size. Even right out of the camera JPEGs, without any post processing, look a notch or two or five better than your typical small camera.With my largish hands I found the handling a bit \"fiddly\" and mildly uncomfortable, YMMV -- between the large lens area on front, the large (awesome even in the bright sun) rear display taking up so much real estate, and lack of a front grip this camera may not be the one-handed dreamcam you think it can be (optional grips to help run $30+).  It also doubles as a fiddly 2-handed cam, too!  Keep that left hand off the top left pop-up flash space!  I sometimes missed the shutter button and instead nearly pressed the on/off button.  But hey, more time with the RX100 would likely result in better acclimation, after all, as humans we're quite the adaptive ones, yes?Don't believe anyone telling you this thing is a slam-dunk, can't-lose model -- your needs might best be satisfied with less pricey models, or cameras offering more flexible options for not much more moola.

Im glad that sony did not incorporate click stops on the ring like what you get on the canon s100. It helps to avoid any unnecessary sounds being recorded on your final video file if you choose to manipulate settings while you shoot video. The built in carl zeiss lens delivers superb pictures with very good sharpness overall.

The other reviews on Amazon, plus all the pro reviews are consistently clear:  this is the best pocket camera out there right now.  And I completely agree.  Should you pay $650 for one?  It depends.I bought one of these on a whim and it does handle much quicker than my Canon S90 it is replacing, especially in low light situations.  Will the camera make me a better photographer and dramatically improve the overall quality of my pictures?  No.  If I wanted to really improve my photography, I'd take art classes and spend hours daily practicing the craft.  But I'm too lazy and unmotivated to do that at this point in my life.What this $650 camera will allow me to do is to have an easier time taking those 3 AM shots of me and my friends at the bar or those zoomed-in pictures at the rock concert where having an extra half stop and a bigger sensor will produce slightly cleaner pictures of the various band members.  How often do I really need that level of low light performance in a camera?  Maybe 8 to 10 occasions in any given year.  Most of the pictures I take while on vacation and during my everyday life are shot in good light, and these pictures would look nearly indistinguishable regardless of whether I shot them with my S90 or with my new RX100.  However, I don't spend my free time blowing my images up to 100% and pixel peeping- I'm more interested in the overall picture.  I'm sure if you look really close at comparison photos there's a difference, but who really cares.If you're a person with lots of disposable income to spend on gadgets like this, realizing that in 2 years it will for sure be replaced by the next greatest faster and smaller gadget, then go for it and buy the thing.  I did, and I have no regrets.  I will truly enjoy using this camera for the next few years until the lens gets stuck or the sensor gets all dusty and too expensive to repair.If you're on a budget and the $650 price tag means compromising your food budget for a month, you should seriously consider how often in your life you really need that extra bit of low light performance.  If this camera came out 10 years ago when I was in my early 20's, unemployed, and broke, there's no way this camera would be worth $650 to me.  If this is you, then consider also some of the cheaper but very good cameras like an S95.Update 11-7-12:I'm still using the camera regularly and still think it's solid.A note to readers:  comments equating this camera to \"DSLR quality\" are ridiculous.  The rules of physics have not changed in the last few years.  Though pictures from this camera are excellent (provided the person behind the camera has some skill), no camera with this sized sensor and compact body will ever be able to reproduce the unique image qualities that can be captured using a big camera with a big lens and a big sensor, notably subject isolation via shallow depth of field.

People doesn't want to spend extra money for that.. I believe. Instead of that, Internal flash is really working great.)2. Grip? (I am a big fan of gr digital or lumix LX series grip but for this camera. Without rubber grip, it makes much sharper and cool design. Yes. I want minimized design from Sony. I believe Leica X series has same issue and they are selling extra grip with very expensive price tag. And original leather case is supporting for this part well)3. No battery charger? Yep. I want battery charger.4. No WiFi? Um.. Actually Heavy photo files can be transferred by usb cable I think. no necessary with 20M pixel camera especially. This is seriously compact for professional or mania. GPS? yep... with gps and price higher is not good solution but same price with GPS feature. that will be great.5. Price... well. little expensive..6. 28mm Wide. 24mm or 25mm is very common spec now a days. First, Yes. I like 24mm Wide lens for landscape but also I like 28mm classic wide lens. In my memory, 28mm, 35mm, and 50mm is my old basic 3 lenses always. 28mm is better than 24mm's distortion and low light at corner issue and feel that is enough. also it is very useful for 5-6people shot at short distance. 35mm lens is classic. it is great for everywhere. portrait or landscape, especially street snap. 50mm is really good for portrait. Most of baby photo is from 50mm. On Automatic mode of RX100, easily change. there is 28mm-35mm-50mm - something like this. If there is 24mm option that will be great but without 24mm it is okay.

I don't go out of my way to write reviews very often, but this is one of those rare products which *really* deserves it. If you're like me- coming from various point and shoots with some experience with borrowed DSLRs- I expect you'll be blown away. I'm sure it sounds like hype to a lot of people, but the RX100 really does provide performance similar to an APS-C DSLR in a tiny package. If you're thinking about entry/mid level DSLR like the Canon Rebel T5i or Nikon D3200 and not planning on getting lenses more than the kit 18-55 zoom that it comes with, I'd seriously recommend checking out the RX100.When shopping for a new camera at the beginning of 2013, I started by limiting myself to various advanced compacts like the Canon S110, Panasonic LX7, Olympus XZ-2, Nikon P7700, Canon G15, and Fujifilm X20. The RX100 was so expensive that I dismissed it out of hand- I'd always spent less than half the RX100's price for a camera and the idea of a six hundred dollar plus (!) point and shoot seemed absolutely insane. Because of this, the nearly as expensive X20 and XZ-2 went out the window. After reading way too many reviews and comparing way too many photos, I eventually found myself contemplating the RX100 and decided to just go for it after getting a nice end of year bonus. I'm very glad I did!What I love about this camera:1. Fast and accurate Auto Focus: The AF is very fast, even in low light. Faster than some of the DSLRs I've used with the 18-55 kit lens- easily beat the Nikon D3000 and D3100 and faster than all of the NEX cameras I've used, including my NEX-5R with kit lens. Has far fewer misfocuses or failed AF than my NEX-5R or my wife's EOS M has.2. Fast operation: Shutter lag is short, images pop up for review instantly, and a half shutter press lets you take another photo with no delay. I never have to sit around and wait for the camera to be ready for me.3. Configurability: The menus are less intuitive than a Canon PowerShot for me, but once you have your Fn menu and other buttons all set up you never have to go menu diving, which I really like. I'm able to change settings very quickly.4. Crazy Battery Life: This doesn't always get mentioned, but it's important to me. The second day I had the RX100 I went to a concert, starting off with a full battery. At the end of the night I had taken 500 shots and still had 50% battery life. It's genuinely shocking to me. Mind you, I only use flash and didn't that night.5. Wonderful lens: IMHO, it outperforms every DSLR kit lens I've used in color, contrast, and clarity. There are some compromises they had to make to keep the lens small, like sharp corners at wide angle fully open but what a lot of reviewers seem to forget is that you see the same type of compromises on most compact zoom lenses. My RX100's lens performs better than my NEX-5R's 18-55, that much is for sure.What I don't like mostly has to do with the kind of dumb design decisions that Sony seems to make for all of their NEX and Alpha cameras:1. Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) is very poorly designed. Only +/- 0.7 EV?! And you have to hold the shutter down for the AEB sequence, introducing camera shake and movement. Pretty dumb.2. You can't use the self-timer with AEB - again, needlessly making AEB useless. Bad design.3. No option for a remote: they fixed this with the RX100m2. I have to admit, I was actually kind of surprised- good to see Sony listening to users! Bummer they couldn't make a way for the new wired remote to work with the RX100, though.4. Would have been nice to have some sort of slow-motion video (120 or 240 fps or better) and time lapse feature built-in5. Bulb mode: without a remote, the Sony way of doing Bulb mode is almost useless. I'm not going to hold the shutter down with my finger for a 20 minute star trail! :PIn short, the RX100 has been an excellent all-around camera for me. Great for landscapes when hiking and trail running and it keeps up with my kids in all kinds of light. It performs as well as or even better than a lot of entry level mirrorless and DSLR cameras at higher price tags than the RX100. If you're thinking about getting a DSLR or other interchangeable lens camera and don't plan on buying any lenses other than the one it comes with, you really owe it to yourself to consider the RX100.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hints; especially for those shooting aperture priority.", "Author": "Norm Birndorf \"normb\"", "ReviewID": "R1NTRAU7NUP5XI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't overcook the review, because of the many comprehensive and excellent reviews already posted. Just a couple of hints to use this incredible little camera.1. Get a grip! This little puppy has a small gripping surface on the right, and may suddenly squirt out of your hand. Richard Franiec has a grip for sale on Amazon. It's metal and looks very well designed. Costly, though at about $40.00. I got a silicone grip on eBay for $21.00 it works great. It uses 3M stickon like the stuff that holds your auto badges on. I think a grip is a must. Amazon also sells a \"flipbac grip\" for about $10.00, and this appears almost identical to the one I ordered, but less costly. Should work fine.For those of you like me, who shoot mostly at aperture priority, here's a couple of things to save you time when setting up your camera especially for low light work without flash.2. With the aperture priority setting, the rings, front and back, work the same and control aperture (when set to aperature). As you adjust the aperture, the speed follows to maintain the EV (exposure value). You can use either ring to adjust aperture; I prefer the rear one.At the bottom right of the LCD, aperture and speed are displayed. After you set your aperture for desired depth of field and/or light conditions, note the speed. If it is less than 1/8th sec, you'll need to up the iso. The camera's anti vibration system will give you a couple of stops, but, of course, won't stop artifacts from subject motion.Now how to set the function button to complete the scenario; Here's how mine is set.In the setup menu, under number 2 of the gear icon find the function setting. You have 7 functions to program optionally. I used 3. Set number 1 for iso, number 2 for white balance and number 3 for HDR to control shadows. When you press function the choices are displayed at the bottom of the LCD and selected by the rocker. Changes within each function are controlled by front or rear rings.Ready to take a picture: Set your aperture for desired depth of field using ring or wheel.a. Check aperture and speed at bottom right of LCD,  If the speed is too low for a clear shot, press function and select ISO at the bottom of the LCD with the rocker. Increase ISO with the ring or rocker wheel till you get adequate speed for your aperture setting. With a large sensor at work, there is very little degradation below iso 1600. Once you press the function button, the front or rear wheels now control function button settings that are displayed at the bottom of the LCD. So rock to the desired function and ring to adjust within that function.b. Then select the white balance icon. If the screen does not look realistic, you can set it to one of the many temperature options. If none work out, use \"custom\". Then press the lower rocker to get the custom white balance grid and adjust accordingly with the rocker button. It's nice that the screen changes to reflect how adjustments will effect the shot.c. Last, if you want to exaggerate (or minimize) either contrast or shadows, select HDR and you'll get the HDR screen to allow more or less averaging of subject/background illumination. Very helpful for brightly lit subjects with dark backgrounds or vise verse. The camera will take 3 rapid shots, so be steady. Works well without a tripod, though if you set your ISO up enough.There are lots of other functions to select for your 7 slots such as picture effects, size, orientation, aspect ratio, exposure and flash compensation. If you use a function regularly, set it up and it'll be available at the bottom of the LCD when you press the function button.That's it. I found I could take pretty good low light shots with just these settings on aperture priority, getting depth of field and low light control within the understandable limitations of a camera having the RX100's focal length. It also has shutter priority, 3 memory programmable scenarios, and a fun to use panorama function as well. If depth of field is not an issue for outside shots, just use one of the auto settings.

Looks really cool, and also makes it easier to handle the camera. Plus, it puts the tripod mount closer to the center of the lens.Properly armed with the Gariz case and the included wrist band, I then proceed to turn off all noise, and I mean ALL of it.

I live on a cliff overlooking a fairly large lake, so I've got nice stretches of open space, from distances of about ten feet, all the way out to several miles away -- the volcanoes across the lake. The depth of field is lovely! Captures these lake-scapes in stunning detail.What the camera does and does not do.This is my second camera; my first is a Panasonic G3 with a curious assortment of native and adapted lenses. The Sony RX100 does NOT replace my wonderful Panasonic, nor do I expect it to. Although I am perfectly equipped to take snapshots with my Panasonic, I certainly prefer the RX100 for this type of town and/or country, walk-around photography.If, however, I wanted to photograph landscapes, I would pack the Panasonic with ultra wide lens, though I might put the Sony in my pocket as well, just for backup. Similarly, if I wanted portraits or other types of pictures with a dreamy sort of out of focus background, I would grab my Panasonic with the appropriate manual focus, fast prime, legacy lens. For architecture, I think I could use either camera & be happy with the results -- would probably just put the Sony in my pocket and go!CONCLUSION.If this is your only camera, I think you are in great shape photographically. If your budget or interest allow you this much, you'll be more than satisfied with the results, more so than with any other compact camera, and perhaps even more than anything in the sub-$1000 range of changeable lens cameras.If this is your second camera, the Sony RX100 is a totally compelling reason to have an excellent camera with you at all times, particularly while your main camera is resting or off-duty.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding in every way!", "Author": "Dan333", "ReviewID": "RKF46H81DYU4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a month now and shot around 800 pictures with it (mostly nature; beaches, docks, parks, the zoo, Miami Seaquarium) and I'm still very shocked at the outrageous image quality and video quality!  At 47 years old I had my first camera at around 7 years old and always loved photography so I've had many many cameras.  I sold my Canon 40D and lens after buying this camera because the image quality is considerably BETTER than the Canon 40D.I still have the dslr itch so I'll probably now get the Nikon d7100 which is supposed to have considerably better image quality than this RX100 (hard to imagine better image quality than this)  Sony makes an EXCELLENT sensor!  Nikons are said to have Sony sensors inside.  From the moment I picked this camera up to shoot all buttons and settings were easy to use.I felt like I had shot with this RX100 for a long time and I felt motivated and it felt fun to use.  The speed also beats other point and shoots and no noise at all while shooting.  Very quick and responsive.  I would recommend this to anyone and this camera will set a new very high standard for this size camera and probably for dslr's also since they now should exceed this quality to merit their size and higher price.  You will definitely not regret this purchase even though high for what you THINK is a mere point and shoot camera.  Wait till you see your first crystal clear image come out of this little black box! Wonderful bokeh, f/1.8, no distortions.Update:  Forgot to say the Sony Software is a great conributor to these very high quality RX100 images.  Upon opening the raw software it automatically has the auto settings to create a perfect image as it loads the image.  It's quick also and links to whatever other photo editor you might have.

Although I have been fairly satisfied with their results, I've been wanting to upgrade to a camera with better picture quality (larger sensor), but have resisted getting a heavy, bulky DSLR. For the past year, I've been considering the line of 4/3 format cameras such as the models from Olympus and Panasonic, as well as the Nikon 1, but still felt these cameras were not as compact as I would like. When the Sony DSC-RX100 was introduced, I was immediately impressed with it's specs (20MP 1\" CMOS sensor, F1.8 Zeiss lens, 1080p HD video, etc). After reading all the rave reviews from professionals and consumers alike, I decided to order the camera. It arrived a day before my vacation trip to Cancun, so I didn't have a lot of time to become familiar with the camera's functions. What I found was that the camera was incredibly easy to operate despite the vast assortment of functions and shooting modes. It's bright, hi-res 3\" screen is easily viewable in direct sunlight. The controls are well placed and easy to access. The camera's size and weight is well balanced - definitely pocketable! The fit and finish is very high quality. The RX100's most impressive attribute is its picture quality! The camera produces very crisp and detailed pictures! As I reviewed my photos during my trip on the camera's screen, I could tell the pictures were brighter and sharper than those I was accustomed to with my other point and shoots. However, when I returned home from my trip and downloaded the pictures on my PC, I was floored by the sharpness of the pictures. I was amazed that I was able to crop some pictures to a quarter of their original size and still maintain sharp detail. I also took some 1080p 60p video which looked amazing on my HDTV. My only complaint is that the camera's aluminum case makes it ease to slip out of your hands. It would have been nice if Sony had included a textured grip or surface on the front side. The easy fix is to use the included wrist strap.I'm so glad I held off for this incredible camera.

I bought it as a travel/pocketable camera to avoid lugging or leaving a prosumer DSLR, and in that capacity, it gives me 90-95% of the functionality with 400% less hassle and weight.  The intelligent modes work quite well.  Macro is quite acceptable, low light is outstanding, and DoF is good.  Having used it for travel, my only complaint is that I wish the lens went to 24mm or wider.  In a couple situations, I found 28mm a little too long.  Several times in indoor spaces, I found I couldn't get the full feel of a scene because I needed a little wider.  Also, for some landscapes and some candid shooting, I love the Nikon 14-24mm on a DSLR.  But that isn't a fair comparison in terms of cost, size or weight.In short, you have a triple constraint of cost, quality, and convenience levels with a given camera.  This one gives you 95% quality and 95% convenience.  Given that, I was happy to pay the cost.

This small camera provides most of the flexibility of a much larger, heavier, and more expensive digital SLR (dSLR) or digital Semi-Transparent Lens (dSLT) camera, or even of a somewhat larger, heavier, and more expensive Mirror-less Interchangeable Lens Camera (MILC) such as Sony's NEX line of cameras.  The RX-100 allows the photographer to control the shutter speed, aperture, ISO, auto-focus area, etc., and creates RAW format images, in addition to the less useful JPEG images.  Also, the RX-100 menu system is reasonably intuitive, and easier to manage than the menu system of Sony's NEX line of cameras, about which you can read numerous complaints.  The RX-100's 1\" sensor is roughly 3 times larger than the 1/2.3\" sensor of the typical compact camera, and consequently provides much better image quality than any other compact camera, with the obvious exception of the Sony RX1 compact camera that has a full-frame sensor, and that is roughly 4 times more expensive.  The RX-100 boasts a high-quality Zeiss 28-100mm lens, which at 28mm has a maximum aperture of f/1.8 that is very impressive for a compact camera.  The RX-100 is a valuable addition to a serious photographer's toolkit, and is as well a viable entry point for the amateur photographer to learn and practice the basic principles of serious photography.However, you get what you pay for, and although the RX-100 sensor is superior to the sensor of any compact camera of similar size and somewhat similar price, its sensor is no match for the sensor of a full-frame compact camera, a full-frame digital SLR, a half-frame digital SLR, or a half-frame MILC camera.  For example, the dxomark website provides the following ratings of the sensors for various Sony (and other) cameras, based on measurements of the Color Depth, Dynamic Range, and Low-Light ISO characteristics of those sensors: RX1 full-frame compact (93), A99 full-frame dSLT (89), A77 half-frame dSLT (78), A57 half-frame dSLT (75), NEX-7 MILC (81), and RX-100 compact (66).  Viewed from the perspective of these DxO ratings, the RX-100 sensor is in a class with Sony's first dSLR camera, the A100 that DxO gives a rating of 61.  So, on one hand, the RX-100 provides equivalent image quality to the A100 dSLR, but on the other hand, the RX-100 image quality falls far short of the quality of the A99 dSLT or RX1 compact.But even considering the superior image quality of a dSLT camera such as the A99, this large, heavy camera is of no use to you unless you are able to take it with you.  And taking a large, heavy camera everywhere you go is impractical.  So, finally, this issue shows the strength of the RX-100.  It is small, light, and unobtrusive, so you can take it with you frequently, and you will have it available to take high-quality photographs, even if those photographs are not of the highest possible quality that you might obtain with a larger, heavier, and more expensive camera.If you insist on the highest-possible image quality in a compact camera, and you are willing to pay for that quality, consider the RX1 instead of the RX100.  The dimensions of the RX1, in terms of height, width and depth, are 113mm by 65mm by 70mm, whereas for the RX-100 those dimensions are 102mm by 59mm by 36mm.  The weight of the RX1 is 482 grams, whereas the weight of the RX-100 is 240 grams.  So, the RX1 has twice the depth and weight of the RX-100, a fact that makes the RX-100 a less obtrusive compact camera.  The RX1 has a 35mm f/2 lens, whereas the RX-100 has a 28-100mm f/1.8 zoom lens, but the aperture of the RX-100 lens is f/1.8 only at 28mm, and decreases steadily to f/4.9 as the focal length increases from 28mm to 90mm: f/1.8 at 28mm, f/2.8 at 35mm, f/3.2 at 50mm, f/4 at 70mm, and f/4.9 at 90mm.  The RX1 costs $2,800, whereas the RX-100 costs $650.Sony provides a downloadable, 68-page English/Spanish \"Digital Still Camera / Instruction Manual\" in PDF format for the RX-100 that doesn't give enough detail to be fully useful  However, if you perform a Google search, you will find a 227-page or a 261-page much more comprehensive \"Cyber-shot User Guide / Sony RX-100 User Guide\" in PDF format, that is similarly downloadable from a Sony web page, although Sony doesn't provide any apparent clue that this more comprehensive manual exists.  And, if you need even better instructions on the use of the RX-100, you can perform a Google search for Friedman Archives and buy the 425-page \"The Complete Guide to Sony's CyberShot RX-100\", which, at a price of $21.45 in PDF format, would still be cheap at twice the price.One caveat that you can find on page 203 of the 227-page version of the comprehensive \"Cyber-shot User Guide / Sony RX-100 User Guide\", or on page 235 of the 261-page version of that guide, is the fact that connecting the RX-100 to a computer via the USB cable can be idiosyncratic.  In particular, you may need to connect the USB cable directly to the computer, instead of to a USB hub.  Also, you may need to disconnect from the computer any USB devices other than the RX-100, the computer keyboard and the computer mouse.  Additionally, you may need to configure the RX-100 \"USB Connection\" to \"Mass Storage\" using the RX-100 menu system.  This idiosyncratic behavior is the first such behavior that I have noticed in any Nikon, Minolta or Sony digital camera that I have owned, and I have owned more than a few.In conclusion, the RX-100 sets a new benchmark for compact cameras, and is well worth its price.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST COMPACT for Size and Ability, but.....", "Author": "Bears Fan Jim \"qm2-703\"", "ReviewID": "R3RDX6XPEXP3U7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Compared to these I have borrowed from friends or owned or had on trial for a week or more: XZ1, P310, LX5, S95, several superzooms, NEX5N....A./ Best combo of size and features of any compact out there....slightly smaller than an LX5, slightly bigger than a S95, because of its lens casing.

Much better ISO 1600 thru 6400, and therefore ability to use S mode and higher shutter speed to stop moving kids and pets. Again, for families, don't blow your budget on added lenses fot the NEX - the kit zoom is fine. Does everything the RX100 does and better, just physically larger to carry, but certainly ok in a purse, pouch, or on a neckstrap.For the pro who is constantly changing ISO/Aperture/Shutter/ev/WB....the RX100 is worth the money. It really is a tiny DSLR up to iso 1600... XZ1 could do in a pinch, as it is very controllable and just a step behind in ISO, very good 400 and better than most other compacts at 800...I now own a Sony NEX-5N : fantastic, has usable ISO6400 even indoors, but cumbersome interface. I also own a Canon SX260, mainly for its great zoom, price, and it can go in almost any pocket w/o worrying that you are going to break a $600 investment.After many, many trials, my opinion is: It is very difficult to beat the FZ-150 and SX260 superzooms: very good macro and great zoom at the same time, plus very acceptable Auto Mode, then throw in full manual adjustments and very good video.Forgetting price, for overall quality of both stills and video, buy the NEX 5N. For size, speedy interface, plus clear indoor iso800 and maybe iso1600 ability, the RX100 is really all there is as a non-interchangeable lens camera right now.

Almost as good as entry level SLR.  Canon is slow, very slow, I can not use it after spending a few weeks with RX100.- PQ: both make good pictures comparable to entry level SLRs with mid range lenses.

I was really missing this future and now is very happy to get it back with RX100- Lens: Also subjective, I feel that RX100 lens is sharper and of cause it is much brighter (1.8 vs 2.8). Add macro capability and RX100 is a clear winner in this category- Sensor:  Canon is larger, but brighter lens compensates.

The flash is really good, but you'll find you don't really need it much because of the Zeiss lens 1.8, except for some indoor pics. The indoor pics are just as good as the outdoor pics, even the night pics outside are crazy.It's not only a good camera but it's also an artistic tool, if you're really into photography it has the options and image quality you need to get the pictures you want. I've been really happy with this purchase. Some reviers had mentioned the pop-up flash being and issue, it's not, it's cool and have no issues, just a little diffrent, many cameras have the pop-up now, you get use to it right away; and some people were complaining about the charger, after buying the camera their complaints don't make sense, you can plug it in a wall socket or pc, it has wall charger with a usb cable like a cell phone I love it, and it's compact. Some people always find the smallest and insignificant things to complain about.Orginally I had doubt's because of so many wack P&S; cameras out there and the price, but after doing reasearch and looking at some pics online in Flickr and steve huff's website I gave it a try, I'm so happy I bought it. I thought the 1 inch Bionz sensor size and Zeiss lens was just another marketing hype but they are not, they work really well together. If you are looking for a profesional pocketable camera that you want to take everywhere this is it. I love Canons but I have been disppointed with the quality of a lot of my pictures with some of the Canon P&S;'s so I started looking outside of the box and I wound up buying a Sony, which I never thought I would; I could not be happier. Sony has really come a long way, and I would say they have some of the best camera's out there right now.Canon has some nice camera's and lens but it doesn't mean everything they make is perfect and that theres no other brands out there that make camera's that have the same quality and in many cases even better quality products. You just have to do your research and try it out and not just buy blindly based on passed experiences with a brand or just based on brand loyalty. That's what happened with me and Canon, I was limiting myself to finding excellent quality Cameras like the Sony RX100 and the Fujifilm xe1 because of my loyalty to Canon as a cutomer. As a loyal customer I tried Canon first but I did'nt find what I was looking for after several tries. I'm happy I did'nt just stick to something I was'nt happy with just because of the brand I have finally found something I can truly say I'm happy with and it was worth my money, the Sony Rx100, now I look forward to Sony's future camera's, I hope they continue on the path they've been on. Sony's on point right now, especially with the introduction of Zeiss lens, they've been putting a lot of time and resources into their camera division; definitely a good investment.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "For Me, An Essential.", "Author": "David DeNagel", "ReviewID": "R1G6D3SZ0DLUT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I seldom write product reviews.

Briefly, it blows me away.Before I get into details of the camera, my own background in perspective.  I'm a total amateur, who has gone in and out love with photography as a hobby.  I had a SLR back in the film days, but really a mid level camera with a couple different lenses.  Around 2006, I purchased a dSLR -- The Sony Alpha A100.  I chose that model, simply because it was compatible with the lenses I already owned.  I built up my gear, around that camera.  Added a tripod, added a (old used) fast prime lens.  In 2011, I took my family to Disney World, and was constantly making use of the whole camera setup.  That was the high point of my dSLR use.  Then slowly, gradually, I felt like I was being weighted down by the camera.  Too cumbersome to carry all the time.  Even when it was strapped to my back, too much of a chore to change the lenses.  So when planning another trip to Disney World in 2012, the Sony RX100 caught my attention.  dSLR quality, in my pocket.  Could it really be that good?I'm sure that the Sony RX100 will not measure up to a top-of-the-line 2012 model dSLR.  But I am very confident that it will generally match up well against a current model entry level dSLR.  And it gets significantly BETTER results than my old 2006 dSLR.So when looking at the pros and cons, how does it differ from my 2006 dSLR?Probably the 2 most important elements in any camera, are the lens and the sensor.  dSLRs have significantly bigger sensors than point & shoot cameras.  A bigger sensor can capture more light faster, and typically therefore can produce far better results.  The Sony RX100 sensor is still smaller than dSLRs, but it is significantly larger than almost any other true compact camera on the market. While still smaller than my 6-year-old dSLR, I'm guessing advances in sensor technology over the 6 years, makes up for some of the size difference.  Turning to the lens -- a dSLR camera can change lenses.  the RX100 only has 1 lens, but WOW -- It is an amazing lens, made by a well respected brand in lenses.  The lens stops down to a 1.8 aperture at the widest angle.  For those who don't know aperture, it means that the lens opens very wide, allowing more light to reach the sensor, more quickly.  On the \"included\" lens that comes with most dSLR cameras, then aperture is not nearly as wide.So combine the above-average-sized sensor for a point and shoot, with a top of the line lens -- And you get results consistently better than my 6-year-old dSLR, with mediocre lenses.This sensor/lens combination gives you a lot of advantages, comparable or even superior to some dSLR/lens combinations.  It shoots VERY well in low light.  Sensor \"sensitivity\" to light is measured in ISO.  My old camera maxed out at 1600 ISO.  So even with a very wide aperture, I wasn't able to take pictures on dark rides at Disney.  The RX100 maxes out in manual mode at 6400.  (there are some auto tricks that raise it even higher).  With ISO 6400 and the wide aperture, I was capturing usable images of rides in the dark at Disney.Another great advantage of the wide aperture is bokeh -- The ability to take a picture with a blurred background.  It's fairly easy to achieve with a dSLR AND an extra lens.  The lens included with most entry level dSLRs, won't have a wide enough aperture to achieve this effect.  The RX100 achieves it with fair success.  My SLR, with an extra lens, can still do it a bit better.  But the RX100 probably does it better than any other compact camera.Finally, the whole system focuses very quickly and accurately.  Typically, SLRs focus much faster than compact cameras.  The RX100 focuses MUCH faster than my 6-year-old dSLR.  The focus speed feels comparable to most entry level DSLRs.For someone with a real or developing knowledge of photography, this camera has the advantage of very full manual control.  You can take control over just about any of the settings, and can customize various menus and settings to your liking.  While common in dSLRs, this is not found across compact cameras.The camera has the pro of it's 20 megapixel sensor combined with the ability to shoot in \"RAW\" mode.  This allows you to capture huge amounts of data in every photograph, which opens a lot of possibilities in post processing.The camera has a whole array of special modes, that are becoming increasingly common across cameras.The best ones that are included:In camera HDR -- Automatically quickly snaps 3 images and combines them.  In the past, I could only do HDR with post processing, and generally had to take the pictures with a tripod.  Now I can do it, in camera, hand held.Panorama -- Works the same as the new iphone.Handheld low light and similar modes -- Much like HDR, it combines multiple images.  In this case, it combines the image results to correct for low light, or correct for camera shake.There are multiple other modes.  For example, I've had fun with the watercolor mode, which turns the photograph into a watercolor painting.  Also selective color capture -- A black and white photograph, but with just 1 color showing through.  These little things are a bit gimmicky and can be applied in post- processing.  But if you want to avoid post-processing, then this can give you fun results right out of the camera.Whether used in automatic or manual modes, I am regularly blown away by the image quality of this camera.  And that's what really matters.Now, the camera isn't perfect.  There are some places where Sony made sensible compromises, and some other places where they just made mistakes.Sensible compromises:-The lens does not have a huge zoom.  There are compact travel zoom cameras with 20X zoom.  The RX100 is limited to about 4X optical zoom.  (You can zoom further digitally).  For most photographs, in most situations, this zoom is good enough.  Further, with 20 megapixels to work with, you can easily crop to get a more zoomed-in result.  But you're not going to be photographing a lady bug from 50 feet away.  I listed this as a sensible compromise, because to build a lens with the quality of the RX100 AND with a massive zoom, the lens alone could cost $1,000+.  The mega zoom lenses found on compact cameras typically have a mediocre quality.  They don't have the aperture ability of build quality of the RX100.-No GPS or WiFi.  These are becoming more common in cameras.  I like GPS data built into the picture personally.  But these things are easy to live without.  They don't affect picture quality.  And leaving these items out, helped keep the price from becoming ridiculous.- No touch screen.  I don't even love touch screens.  Probably left out, to help keep the price down.- No optical viewfinder.  No hot shot, to allow addition of a viewfinder or external flash.  I suspect this was primarily done to help keep the size of the camera down.  A compromise I'm willing to accept, to keep this camera truly a \"compact.\"Mistakes -- Not many.- No external charger.  3rd parties already are coming out with chargers, but 1 should have come with the camera.  As sold, the battery can only be charged in the camera.- Flimsy door for charging/USB.  Speaking of the in-camera charging, the door to the port feels flimsy and feels like it is going to fall off every time I open it.Some final thoughts.Comparing this camera to a true dSLR, the pros and cons are obvious.  A dSLR, with a larger sensor and the ability to change lenses, gives you a much broader range of possibilities, with higher potential quality.  But it's big, cumbersome.  And to get all those lenses, you need to invest more and more money.  In contrast, the RX100 fits in your pocket, and in MOST situations, can give you pictures quite comparable to a dSLR.  In that context, the price of the RX100 is a bargain.  It's about the same price as the entry level dSLR, but you don't need to invest more in lenses.Where you enter a grayer area, is the wide assortment of bridge cameras/mirrorless cameras.  There are an increasing number of cameras that are smaller than dSLRs, but still slightly larger than a true compact.  Some of these cameras have interchangeable lenses, some have fixed lenses.  They may also have sensors somewhere between compacts and SLRs.  Within this category, you may find cameras of similar quality to the RX100, at a similar price.  They will be larger than the RX100, but not as large as a dSLR.  So for many people, this whole group of cameras may be a consideration as well.Anyone who loves photography, will enjoy the RX100.  It won't replace a dSLR for all people in all situations.  But it can accomplish remarkable results for a tiny camera.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Another lethal blow from Sony", "Author": "DATA", "ReviewID": "R1GB3ECHEYGDBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally another product from Sony where they are fully capable to display their multifaceted engineering capabilities.Pros: Beautiful, neutral and accurate colors, class leading resolution and sharpness even with jpegs, slr-level dynamic range in DRO auto mode, usable iso 3200, minute size, very usable optical range, fast focusing - even in video.

In fact, I am using the case for my wife's Lumix TZ8. I can bring this camera with me anywhere.One big advantage is safety: if you travel to places that are not 100% safe, any potential robber would mistake it with a cheap $200 camera. More importantly, you will nevr have to leave this camera in a hotel room, on the trunk of your car, or will have to carry a big backpack with camera and accessories.Why this is size so important? You miss 100% of the shots you can't take because you cannot bring your camera. Because this is a camera you will carry anywhere. There have been many business trips, weekend opportunities and just in the moment photo opportunities where it was not practical or safe to bring my big DSLR. That is no longer a problem with a portable camera like this that gives me all the quality and control I need as an experienced photographer.The only downside to size it that it looks pretty ridiculous to have this camera mounted on a tripd (as I did last night taking skyline shots at dusk) and that you don't have the `professional' look of sdomeone carrying a large camera with a big lens, which sometimes is useful getting access to normally unavailable areas for tourists.QUALITYSony has been improving the quality of its digital cameras steadily for the last few years.  In February of 2011 I got a HX5V which was quite impressive, and delivered quality images even when compared with a DSLR except for low-light and other tricky situations. I traded it for a Canon PowerShot S95 which was a step ahead but still suffered from high noise levels in low light settings.What makes this camera unique is a 1\" CMOS sensor. It is the only camera in this class or in similar size with a sensor this big. The law of physics is very simple: larger sensor, higher quality and lower noise. Sure you could get a NEX-5 with an even bigger sensor for slightly better quality but you would be stuck with a much, much larger camera, especially because of the size of the lens, and a much higher price.Combined with a minimum aperture of f/1.8, Carl Zeiss optics and a lot of cool features from Sony such as the Auto HDR and very cool camera effects, it is an amazing camera. After a week of playing with it I am wondering why would the average person need anything more than this camera.Last, I really love the on-screen information (and the quality of the display), especially the level indicator that helps you shoot straight pictures.EASE OF USEDon't let the power scare you away from this camera. As most point and shoot cameras, this one has an `auto' mode that is usually quite good at getting the right settings for each shot. If you ar enot an expert, you will feel at home with the Sony RX100 camrea having used any pocket digital camera, and you will enjoy the high quality it delivers.I found the menus to be intuitive, the camera feels solid and built with high quality materials.AREAS OF IMPROVEMENTProcessing speed takes a few seconds, but given the quality of the effects I would be surprised if they took significantly less time. Still, often you have to wait a second or two after a shot if you use advanced in-camera processing such as HDR.The 3.6 Zoom goes to 105mm I think, which is fine for most situations but could be nice to have a 200mm 9equivalent) zoom. I know adding such a zoom would require a larger lens so I rather keep the portability as is. Further, with 20 megapixels, you can zoom in to your photos easily in post production.Overall, if you are an experienced hobbyist or a semi-professional photographer looking for a camera to take always with you, or a backup/alternative to your big clunky DSLR, don't look any further.

Over and over again, the fine detail the RX100 captures in a wide variety of shooting situations is surprising and delightful, and it gets the job done quickly and efficiently.  Colors are rich, and while the RX100's color rendering is more akin to the punchy rendering typical of small lens compacts than the Canon DSLR's I'm used to, it offers sufficient resolution, control, and versatility to produce really high quality images, and I'm looking forward to exploring this camera's unique personality.  As someone else said in an article on the RX100, it's not just \"good enough,\" it's \"good!\" In future generations, I'd like to see a lens that could maintain a shallower depth of field at longer focal lengths, and a hot shoe so I could mount my Phottix transmitter and use off-camera strobes.  I could see neat possibilities with impromptu portraiture, still lifes, and such if you could trigger off-camera strobes.  But the RX100 will do a top-notch job in most of those situations where you wouldn't be carrying a speedlite and and other gear, and much of the RX100's beauty and power comes from the fact that because it's so light and fits in your pants pocket, it can ALWAYS be with you.  I found the controls easy to get used to and convenient enough.  No, it's not a Canon 5D with a set of L lenses and speedlites.  But it is seriously competent gear, and I think every serious photographer will have a blast and find a use for this pocket wonder.Update.  I'm a couple weeks and many dozen shots deeper into exploring this wonderful machine.  I'm even more impressed than I was when I wrote the comments above, if that's even possible.  The one \"weakness\" I lament with this camera is that like all small lens cameras, it doesn't offer as much opportunity to shoot with shorter depths of field and blur the background like you can with a DSLR.  But what it does best, over and over again, is deliver exceptional detail from edge to edge and corner to corner.  It conveys depth exceptionally well, like when you're shooting down a long street or river.  It rivals my Canon DSLR's in resolution and with low ISO's, the images are really impressive, even when you enlarge to 200% in photoshop.  The intelligent auto is really intelligent!  With a single press of the trigger, I've shot night shots that would have required several test shots and adjustments with my DSLR's.  The in camera jpg processing is generally excellent and the auto white balance is really good, too. Auto focus is at least as fast as any other compact I've ever used.  Truly amazing. Amazing hardware coupled with amazing software.  The world of compact cameras will never be the same---the Sony RX100 has set an entirely new standard for what a compact camera can be. I'm really enjoying this camera, but also look forward to future generations of this new technology.  As I said in my original review, I'd really like to see a version of this camera with a hotshoe so I could trigger off camera flash.The panorama function works well, but cuts the number of vertical pixels from over 3648 to 1856.  That's still a lot of detail, but if you want the option of printing the images later in a really large size, it would be best to shoot a series of individual images and then stitch them together in photoshop the old fashioned way.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the manual focus feature", "Author": "cmajor9th", "ReviewID": "R1MT3WELGBV6E4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for about 6 months for casual photography and so far really like it and the image quality.To highlight one aspect: the capability of using the lens ring for manual focusing has solved a big issue I've always had with my previous P&S; cameras... getting an exact focus on one portion of an object.  When in manual focus mode, twisting the lens ring immediately zooms the LCD view to tiny area in the image field so you can precisely set the zoom (without worrying about whether your eyesight is accurate enough ;-) and then restores the full image view in the LCD shortly after ring motion has stopped.  I now find my self using this capability much more than not, with the result of more crisp pictures than when just relying on the AF.My only disappointment so far...  seems like the flash is a bit harsh (so I try to avoid using it as much as possible), but OTOH I haven't tried to tweak it yet or see if I can make it more indirect, etc.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best point and shoot EVER!", "Author": "Manwithnoname", "ReviewID": "R3R2OOM5YDO3Z5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Nikon D800 and I must say that the Sony DSC-RX100 is by far the best compact camera out there.

It's that fun.Before going into real review, I'd like to first alert you that the \"Most Helpful Critical Review\" for this camera that claimed the RAW format is NOT supported is completely wrong on this point.Sony's RAW file, ARW format, is a long standing proprietary format that's likely very well supported: After I took a RAW image with RX100, I did a quick Googling and then tried the first two well-reviewed free software that claimed to do RAW conversion - and both supported ARW!  Both can open and then save to other formats. One is Photoscape, which has basically no feature support when doing the RAW conversion other than autoWB (Edit: I was wrong here, one could actually use 'Edit' feature after choosing the ARW file to make many adjustments in Photoscape too). The other is Raw Therapee, which has all sorts of controls available, and this is the one I'm going to use. Googling also finds a 2007 post on dpreview that said Adobe Photoshop Elements (watered down PS) does fast RAW conversion of ARW files. Another 02/2012 post claim Adobe Camera Raw 6.0 or 6.5 (free for PS CS5) supported ARW. And that critical review's dated 7/31/2012! It's just completely wrong. (Edit: there are others confirming that Adobe's support is just out, so that review might be about Adobe only, but its title and content both claimed no 3rd party (not just Adobe) support, which is definitely wrong).Now the real review:Instead of recounting all the pros and cons others have said so many times, I just want to write down my impressions on the camera from the angle of a complete photography newbie:1. Great image quality. Great colors, beautiful Bokeh effect. My unprocessed shots on flowers, portraits, match real photographers'. Low light performance is impressive.2. Great night shots. If you set camera on Superior Auto mode, and take a night shot by hand, it looks as good as anyone's. RX100 takes multiple shots and somehow combine them to improve lighting without blurring the image.3. In-camera panorama mode is convenient, but not that great. The adjacent images are frequently shifted (particularly obvious if there's human face in photo), the moving speed of the camera needs to be slow and the last part of the image sometimes were grayed out.4. In-camera HDR is really nice, and you can adjust the bracketing to some extent. Good on static objects. Combines only 3 shots though.5. Love the watercolor, had great fun with it.6. The Superior Auto mode is so great that I almost always keep it on. It does occasionally go into the wrong mode (ie, landscape instead of macro).7. Video qualities are very good, but I feel my Panasonic TM900 is still better except for color fidelity. A pity that RX100 doesn't take external mics but the audio is surprisingly good (maybe my expectation was low for onboard mic for such a tiny camera that's mostly for photos).8. Image stabilization is great. My hands are not steady, but even when Superior Auto mode takes several photos in quick succession, there's rarely a photo that comes out blurry.9. Many preset modes, and they work well.10. BIGGEST advantage: So small that I do put it in my pants or shorts pocket and take it anywhere - that's why I took so many photos so quickly!11. Another BIG advantage: No need to bring a lens kit with you! For newbies, no time/money wasted investing which lens to buy. Some might feel that you can't change lens with this, but I think Canon's EOS-M is a dumb idea. Why would I want to bring a big lens with a pocket camera? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of POCKET camera? If I want to use multiple lenses, I'd buy T4i instead.12. 3.6x Zoom is small. It needs to be bigger.13. Price is high, similar to low end DSLRs, but it's worth it because it takes DSLR-like photos but has the added advantage of being pocketable. You won't miss any precious shots again because you couldn't haul your big camera over.14. The flash is very bright. Auto-focus focuses well in near completely black, and the flash flashes an impressive distance.15. Reviewing the photo was easy. Navigating menus is also easy.16. My BIGGEST complaint: The distortion near edge starts early and very noticeable. If you take photo of people, I feel that even for people standing 8 feet away, only the middle half the area (not half the length, thankfully) do not have distortion. I wonder if it's just my camera.17. A tip: Say you enter Scenes mode and chose macro, and then you want to switch to landscape, it's fairly hard to find out how to quickly switch. I used to switch to auto mode, then back to Scenes and choose landscape. But later I accidentally found out that you just have to use the focus ring to change this setting! I know those that read manual probably discovered this already, but I never read any manuals for electronics, so this one took me some time. But I had no trouble with other things I want to do.18. Continuous shooting, speed priority mode are both fun to play with. Nice and clear photos. I feel that both are slower than the specs indicated though - of course one could argue that my class 10 card might not be fast enough, but it is true class 10 speed.19. Photos taken during video taping are not very good (it's 16:9 too), but it's still a nice feature to have. It takes a long time to write to SD card, so you can't take photos in quick succession during video.20. Focus is so quick that you rarely ever miss a moment (rushed shot in low light situation still frequently turns out blurry though, but that's hard to avoid).", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "camera broke at 14 months", "Author": "C.

For most of the trip I kept the camera in my pocket (it is a pocket camera after all!) and took it out to snap photos of our adventures.  I took approximately 600 pictures with the camera over a two week period.  By the time I returned the LED display was ugly with scratches.  In my defense, I did not keep keys, coins or other hard objects in the pocket with the camera.  I simply slid it in and out of my pocket and by the time I got back to the States, the display was ugly with scratches.  My iPhone 4S by the way was in my other pocket, one where I typically keep coins and other somewhat hard objects.  The iPhone's display, now going on one year is nearly perfect.  Why can't Sony employ similar technology on a premium product like the RX100?  Also, I bought a Canon 5D MK3 in June and that camera, obviously not a pocket camera, gets banged around while hanging over my shoulder against all manner of obstruction.  Its display too is without any scratches whatsoever so I know that the technology to build a more durable scratch resistant display exists.Fortunately, the display works perfectly and is usable for reviewing the pictures, but I'm very concerned that the accumulation of scratches after a year or so will render the display opaque!I'm also told that the same type of display is on Sony's new $2800 RX1.  If that's the case, then I'll think long and hard before dropping that kind of money on a camera whose display is so easily marred.

I wanted to report my initial impressions of this camera, while they're fresh.There are many reviews raving about the quality of this camera and the spectacular images that are attainable, so I won't cover that again.  I mainly want to talk about the pop up flash design, which has received a lot of criticism.  I almost didn't purchase this camera because of all of the negative comments about the flash unit.  The reviewers had me convinced that it was a design flaw, and I wanted to wait for the next generation RX 200 or whatever to come out.  I am so glad I didn't wait!  The first thing I did when I got the camera was inspect the flash.  This is a very nice little flash unit, with a well designed pop up mechanism.  It doesn't look sturdy in photos, but the mechanics of the pop up unit are all metal, and very robustly designed.  Did you also know that this flash can be directed up at the ceiling to use as bounce flash?!  And it has the light power to do it, too.  (Thanks Gary Friedman for that tip - buy his guide book for this camera, it's excellent).The other thing people complain about is the lack of an external charger.  Okay, but there are very inexpensive after market chargers available, so don't let that stop you.Also, this camera has two very intelligent modes that allow the camera to be used as an excellent point and shoot, so if you're not an experienced camera user, but want to get amazing photos, then this is still a good choice for you.One issue for me is the camera is a little bit larger than what I expected, but I was a long time user of a series of Canon Elph cameras.  This camera is definitely not as \"shirt pocketable\" as the Elphs were, but I did tuck it into the back pocket of my shorts today and it wasn't overly bulky.

I really dislike small sensor P&S; cameras because of their IMO horrible IQ above base iso and slow focusing speed, especially in low light. My rating is based on comparisons to other P&S; cameras of this size, not to the much larger cameras I'm used to.I have not used any of the various tricks the camera can do except sweep panorama which works very well.Some people say their camera came without a manual. Maybe earlier samples didn't but mine did. Since I am used to the Sony menu system I did not need to read it. After a quick look through it seems adequate to get you started.There have been complaints about the ring around the lens lacking click points. That doesn't bother me in the least. I actually prefer it that way because if you are using it for precise manual focus the the click points make that more difficult.In my opinion the jpgs from this camera are much better than any P&S; even at base iso and the difference becomes more pronounced as iso goes up. The photos are good to iso 1600 but by iso3200 things get a bit iffy depending on conditions. If you are using iso3200 in decent light to keep the shutter speed up the results are pretty good but if you are using it indoors in poor light the results are  not as good but acceptable for maybe an 8x10 print.Auto Focus speed and accuracy. Generally P&S; cameras focus poorly in anything but daylight. I am happy to report that the RX100 focuses like a DSLR indoors in poor light. Another thing nobody seems to mention is the flash can be bounced off the ceiling to eliminate the harsh direct lighting you get from direct flash.Auto iso is fully programmable for low and high. Default maximum is iso3200 which I changed to 1600. Maximum is allowable 6400. All or most of the buttons are programmable for different functions and you can memorize up to, I believe, 5 different combinations depending on need.This camera is clearly aimed at someone who wants as close to DSLR functionality and IQ as possible in as small a package as possible. Lets be clear. It is not a camera that can replace a DSLR unless small size is more important but is comes close. If you are someone like myself who is unwilling to make the sacrifices in IQ and focus speed that small cameras have previously required but really like the idea of a small carry everywhere pocketable camera then this is the only game in town. No other camera of this size is even in the same ball park.If you are looking for a do everything camera with a lens that goes from 1:1 macro to super zoom this is not the camera for you. Be aware that such cameras make significant sacrifices in IQ. If you want the best IQ that is currently possible in a small size this is it.I bought this camera as a companion to my A55 and A65. I have been carrying my A55 with 18-200 and A65 with Tamron 70-300 USD which is a bit cumbersome. The RX100 replaces the A55 and it's small size makes carrying 2 cameras far easier and more convenient. It allows me to always have a camera with me who's IQ satisfies me which no small sensor P&S; or Smart phone can do.

The photos are very detailed and exhibit near DSLR quality in good conditions. It's great and will blow cheaper point and shoots away.  The flash is surprisingly POWERFUL and is still very bright when tilted up to bounce off a ceiling. Autofocus is very fast. However, a DSLR is still easily better. Subject isolation (aka bokeh or blurred background) is poor with this 1 inch sensor and lens.  If you are taking a photo of a subject, poor subject isolation means the background cannot be very well isolated from your subject, giving your photos the 'point and shoot' look of small cameras.  Beautiful bokeh is the trademark of larger sensored cameras that no smaller sensored camera like the RX100 can match.  The effect is even more pronounced with a cheap prime lens on a DSLR. Shooting in RAW format, this sensor also gives you about 1/2 to 1 stop of dynamic range. This is ok for minor shadow or highlight recovery, but a DSLR like the Nikon D5100 gives you about 2 stops of dynamic range. The Nikon will easily recover seemingly unrecoverable blown highlights and shadow detail. This ability can make a big difference to your photos in subpar lighting conditions. If you are serious about producing truly beautiful photos, this is not really what you would use. Let's just say the RX100 produces awesome 'point and shoot'-like photos.If you don't like carrying around a heavy DSLR, then a m43 camera from Panasonic or Olympus is a good compromise. The SONY NEX line is a good alternative as well. The only small point and shoot that can match DSLR quality is the Panasonic GM1 with it's larger m43 sensor.

I have also been thrilled with the ability to bounce the built in flash in an improvised fashion by tilting the flash head. The focus is very consistent in its accuracy and the face detection feature can help win the day and is particularly useful in self timer portraits where the countdown does not begin until you enter the picture. This camera is very fast in startup and operation and that is what caught my attention when I first tried it in the airport duty free store. The only real limitation I find is that of the non-constant maximum aperture. As you zoom it declines from F/1.8 to F/5.6 creating some restrictions on distant low light or action shots (somewhat alleviated by higher ISOs such as 6400). Flare seems very well controlled and beach shots in sun blasted Cancun at midday look fine. The supplied battery does yeoman duty as I have not yet had to recharge during a day's worth of shooting and hundreds of shots. For enthusiast photographers there is plenty of control to allow innovation and once learned menus are easily accessed through multiple means.

I first just wanted to find a cheap point and shoot to carry around, but the more I read reviews and thought about it, the less I was willing to compromise on quality. In comes the RX100. I read a lot of good reviews and looking at the expensive pricetag (expensive=good, right?) I realized I might be able to get both good quality and small form factor.The size of the camera is good. I've had it in my pants pocket a couple of time without case and its manageable.A couple of my \"photography enthousiast\" friends are getting this a their travelling light camera.Pros: - Picture quality. I find the image quality outstanding and the only reason I can think of bringing out my DSLR anymore would be for sporting event to use the range of my 17-250mm. - High ISO. RX100 will not popout the flash as much in semi dark conditions. Acceptable noise at high ISO. - Useful features/modes. The auto mode generally goes from landscape to macro at the right moment. - Body feels solid and though (thankfully) I have not dropped it yet, the RX100 feels like it would not fall to piece in such a tragic event. - The main reason I liked DSLRs over point and shoots was the lack of delays on DLSR: There again the RX100 performs. Just click, click, click. No delay. I have a Class 10 SD card and can just snap away, without missing a the moment.Cons: - Weak optical zoom - The lens ring is not used for what I thought it would be for (zoom or focus), but instead it is used for selecting options on the screen. I was kind of unhappy about that. - The lens sticks out of the body a little (up to the ring), basically adding a third of an inch to what you would expect of a point and shoot. - The popout flash is great, though I fear it will eventually break.

I also own a Nikon D7000 and after comparing identical shots - there is no longer a compelling reason to lug around a huge DSLR anymore.  The output of this camera blows away cameras thousands of dollars more, so along with it's size and build quality, it's a relative bargain.  Buy one of the external grips for the body and a good lanyard, a SDXC 64GB memory card and you are all set.

The color and shadow detail is spot on and very sharp images.  I use this for both recreation and in the operating room (for educational purposes).  The ability of this camera to correctly and faithfully reproduce colors under harsh lighting conditions in the OR is amazing.  Every time i see images on the screen, I am almost always amazed at the photo image quality on my computer.  I never get let down.  Low lighting starts to suffer, but i find using the flash still provides a very natural feel to photos and colors.Zoom: i typically don't zoom on photos, because i can generally crop.  But this morning i used some zoom and was extremely happy with the results.  It does have an optical zoom to help prevent serious image degredationEffects: At first i thought this was an odd addition for such an afficionado camera.  But i came to find the \"high contrast\" and \"rich\" b/w options to be a lot of fun.  Sony really did a wonderful job with their in camera processing to create some great photo renderings.  These B/W options also look great once the ISO increases or ambient lighting decreases, it gives the camera a \"FILM\" grain and can have dramatic effects.Panoramic: i used this recently in park city UT on the slopes.  Great and simple panaromas.  Beautiful stitching and not a whole lot of distortion.  One of the simple benefits of having a new camera system.I hope u guys do the right thing and get this camera.

Comparing the results, i couldn't really tell the difference between both in terms of sharpness and image quality! The sony actually had an advantage of have more of the eye in focus (thanks to the smaller sensor!).One limitation to this camera is that you can't do macro on any focal length other than the widest end!Oh and one other thing, setting up a custom white balance on this sony is three times faster than my 5D MK III.Dynamic range is also very decent from a pocket camera (both highlights and shadows).**UPDATE: I've noticed that pictures look horrible when i bump up the iso over 1600 all the way to 6400.

It can go higher--3200 is OK for me in a pinch. I like all the multi frame stuff: In camera HANDHELD HDR, twilight mode, multiframe noise reduction. Sweep panorama is very cool.

I've been waiting for years for a small pocket-sized camera that could take SLR quality pictures.  This is it.The low light pictures are phenomenal.  I think it sees better than I do.  I have yet to take a flash picture, because the results using a high ISO are so good.  On top of that, the 1080 HD video is superb.  This is the perfect travel camera.Well, not quite perfect.  It has some minor irritations:The first is the documentation.  Many features are barely explained.  For example, want to know how close the Macro can focus?  You won't find it in the manual (about 2 inches). Want to know why the zoom vibrates about 3 times a second when it is in continuous focus mode?  No explanation.  Because there was no explanation,  I thought it might be defective, so I got on Sony's chat on-line with a Rep who said that it is supposed to behave that way because continuously varying the zoom is used to determine the proper focus.  I still find it hard to believe.  Sony could have explained quite a bit more with their in-camera documentation.  The context sensitive help often has obvious un-helpful explanations (kinda reminds me of Microsoft) like the explanation for Manual Focus:  \"Focuses manually\".  Duh!The second is the confusing layout for all the options.  The menus are overwhelming.  All the features that can go in the function button are also in the menus.  Four of them are pre-assigned to navigation wheel (display, exposure adjustment, flash and drive mode), and 7 can go in the function list.  Those Eleven settings can be remapped by the user.  With all this variation,  I found that I could could not get the one function I wanted under a button -- setting a custom white balance.  I can map all the white balance settings to a button, but I still have to navigate a menu to get to the custom white balance adjustment.  If you put the white balance on the function list, you cannot set the custom white balance from that location!  Oh well.Second is the control ring.  It could have been better.  It is hard to use it to zoom because it takes too much of a turn to go from wide angle to full telephoto.  If you go to slow it gets jerky.  When it transitions (in video) into digital zoom the zoom speed changes.  It really should feel like a mechanical zoom, but it doesn't.  Same too with focus.  There is no feedback that lets you know where the focus is when you are starting.  Nothing that helps you figure out which way to turn the ring when everything is out of focus.  Is it focusing on infinity or 5 inches?  No way to know if everything is blurry.  Fortunately, there is DMF (no explanation in the documentation for what the \"D\" means) that focuses automatically, and then you can adjust the focus with the ring.  That, along with the \"peaking color\" which shows you what in the picture is in focus, makes the manual focus usable.  I'd prefer a focus indicator that doesn't distort the picture you are trying to compose.  The focus ring changes function in different modes, and you can alter some of them.  What it changes to, and in which mode, and which modes can be altered can be confusing and awkward.  If you set it to zoom, you might be frustrated when it no longer adjusts the f-stop in manual mode.Third is the playback button.  Pushed once when the camera is off and it will turn on.  A second push will activate the camera lens, and this seems like it could be dangerous to the mechanism if it gets jostled in a camera bag.  I will probably remove the battery if I think it might get bumped to much.Fourth is the lack of accessories.  You'd think for this price that you'd get an HDMI cable (it has a micro jack) or make a power supply that also charges a spare battery.  Heck, for the price you'd think they could put in a spare battery!  Adding the possibility for Audio-in would be nice for video recording.Fifth is the price.  It is pricey.  But it really has no competition even with its quirks.  It is an amazing achievement, and I expect to see competition from all the other major camera makers in the next year or so, which should bring down the price.A suggestion if you purchase this camera.  I found little difference in performance with a SanDisk extreme or a Transcend Class 10 SD card.  The San Disk is 3 times faster, but the camera's top writing speed seems to be close to the speed of the Transcend card  -- about 15 MB/sec.  In burst mode (JPGs), the San Disk was slightly faster.  I clocked it at 2.3 pictures per second, compared to the Transcend which went at 2.0 pictures per second.  The video works with a class 4 card according to Sony, so the only difference is burst mode.----------------Update 1/15/2013--------------For those of you interested in burst shooting in Raw Mode, the speed of your card WILL make a difference, and I'd recommend the SanDisk extreme.  I find that the automatic settings that SONY uses to make a JPEG are as good or better than what I can do manually using their software.  I don't have much experience with RAW, but the JPEGs are so good, I don't see much point to learn.  However, if burst shooting of RAW photos is important to you, get a very fast card.Also,  the speed of the camera will slow down significantly as your memory card fills up.  An empty Class 6 transcend card will be faster than my nearly full SanDisk extreem.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wasn't for me", "Author": "Rob M \"Rob M\"", "ReviewID": "R2VL182TXFL6PE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am returning this camera because I can't see a difference between the photos I've taken with the Sony and with my Moto X.

This combination of settings is best for these situations, so that the camera does not FORCE focus onto a face unless you really want it there.+Flexible, fast, continuous shooting.  Sony has two speed options, and the continuous mode, while not as fast as a DSLR or higher end mirrorless camera, is still plenty fast enough to cover most fleeting facial expressions or object movements.+Fully pocketable in size means it with me when I want or need it much more often, and is much less obtrusive in research situations than an interchangeable lens camera.+Tough!  Have already dropped it several times with no ill effects, thank goodness!  This camera has to perform under tough field conditions, and so far, so good!I have owned MANY digital cameras for work and play, and this is my overall favorite!  My Olympus OMD EM5 handles the needs for scenarios where lenses beyond the short zoom on the RX100 are needed (ultra wide angle, longer zooms, fast super sharp primes, unique depth of field requirements), and I really have fun with the OMD when time allows and I want to be a little more involved in the photographic process, but otherwise, the RX100 does all the work and most of the play!Highly recommended!", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect size, good image quality (amazing for this size) but bad user interface", "Author": "Andrei F.", "ReviewID": "RPYKRYE16Z2BH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has an amazing sensor: the resolution and dynamic range are absolutely incredible for a camera of this size. Sony also managed to make a very convincing lens: the zoom range is very useful, the lens is also fast at the wide end. The lens is slow at the telephoto end but this allows to keep the size of the camera truly pocket-able - a very important feature. The lens maybe a tad soft in the corners at some settings, but it is not something that is very obvious, and the subjective quality of the photos is very good. Optical stabilization is good for photo and ok for video.The camera is capable of shooting 1080p video at 60fps. Full manual controls and various color/contrast settings are available in video mode. The video quality is great in terms of color and noise. The resolution is a bit low though. There is noticeable moire on regular structures and thin lines, but no color moire.My strongest complaint about this camera (perhaps, the only complaint) is the user interface. It may be logical for someone, but I find it very unintuitive and slow, it takes a lot of time for me to access important functions.I would say that this is a camera which is capable of delivering absolutely fantastic results in terms of image quality (not in the same league with the best DSLRs but way better than any other compact camera). The camera has a reliable auto mode. All the manual controls are available, but it may be a slow and frustrating process to use them.

The RAW images aren't quite as sharp as my Canon 5D MKII, but you have to view them side by side at 100% to tell the difference.  The camera has only two downsides.  First, the price is quite a bit higher than comparable cameras from Canon and others.

I'm the type that likes to just take pictures and not really care about shutter speed, aperture and things like that.  I just want the camera to take superb pictures just by using the auto function.  That's exactly what this little camera does.  There are two auto functions on this camera: Superior Auto and Intelligent Auto.  I'm not exactly sure what the difference is but both take very good photos (I think Superior is better though because it seems to take many photos at a time and chooses the best photo or something like that).  The main reason why I got this camera is because it is very compact and as close as you can get to a dSLR from a point and shoot.  Also another important quality I needed was to be able to take very good night shots even without flash.  Does it do this?  You bet!  So these are the things I wanted from a camera but boy does it do so much more!Video quality is very good.  At first I thought the video quality was pretty bad because when I uploaded my videos onto iphoto from my macbook air there was so much distortion (horizontal lines) that I thought it was a camera that was only good for taking photos.  Boy was I wrong.  After doing a little research, apparently you need to use some other video thing like Quicktime to truly see how good this camera is at taking videos.  You can adjust your movie quality to even get HD movies.  You can choose between AVCHD and MP4 but I think AVCHD is better quality.  From playing around with the video quality out of AVCHD FX, FH, and PS, I think PS is the HD quality.  FX and FH seem to be the same quality as MP4.  So if you want to save space I think you can do well even with MP4 quality movies.  But you're definitely going to be in for a treat with the PS mode.Battery life is pretty dang good.  I've had this camera for about a month now and I feel like I almost never have to charge the camera.  One time I took a 20 minute long video and I was still at full charge even after 80 more photos!  If your a regular guy like me then the battery life should be good enough for you.The only con I can think of is the menu can take some getting used to.  To me I don't do much much more than \"Superior Auto\", flash/noflash, 10 second shot, and movie mode.  So even the complicated menu is not too bad since I rely on auto mostly.The main point about this camera is it takes great shots even for a guy like me that wants the camera to do all the work in setting up.  It is a bit pricey though.  However, after looking into other point and shoot cameras like the CANON S95-S110, the extra money seems to definitely be worth buying this camera especially when looking into build quality.  There seems to be consistent quality issues with the Canon point and shoots (such as lens issues) but you really don't hear too many problems with the RX100.Important Note: For macbook users, you are able to upload the FX, FH, and mp4 videos directly to iphoto.  However, the PS videos are usually not found.  To overcome this simply click on the \"SD card\" icon on the desktop>click on \"private\" (all of these movies are made using PS mode)>click on a video which should automatically start the movie in quicktime>from Quicktime click on \"File\">click on \"Duplicate\">close the window (a popup should appear to save the file)>save the file on the desktop>now your PS file is on the desktop and you can upload to iphoto.

I have taken 50 or so shots and, in all fairness, the camera is fast and takes good photos. However, I did not find the pictures to be as \"clear as a bell\" as those previously taken with a Canon S110, which is approximately half the price of this Sony. Unfortunately, the S series Canons have had some lens error issues, but other people have also commented about their very good point-and-shoots taking better photos than the RX100.Since this purchase, I have read several comments from photo experts and others stating that the images from this Sony RX100 tend to be soft, and sharpening needs to be done either in the camera or with photoshop, etc. So what is the point of paying double to fiddle around to (maybe) get photos as good as those from another camera without the big price tag? I don't know if many people who are blown away by the RX100 are comparing it to run-of-the-mill point-and-shoot cameras or what. I may continue to try different settings before returning it and getting one of the Canons or something else. Suggestions that are not rude or condescending are welcome. I had high hopes and would be glad to keep this camera if the image quality actually matched the price.UPDATE: Several months later, I tried a Canon S120 but was unable to get photos even as good those from a Canon S110.  The Sony RX100 is $548 now (January 2014) here and elsewhere, so I threw in the towel and got one which hopefully will work out this time.

There is no external battery charger, but I have no issue with this as I bought a spare battery and usually, one fully charged battery got me through 1 day of pictures and video. My T7 had an external charger and I hated that it was the only way to charge the battery.There is no paper manual included (people are seriously insane for taking away 1 star rating for this), but I easily found a digital copy of the manual online.

The RX100 has a ton of manual controls but also has a good \"point and shoot\" mentality for when you want to turn your brain off.  I don't publish dozens of photos to Facebook so I post-process every photo I print.  For me, that means shooting in RAW which the RX100 does.  The bigger sensor means I can get a clear and detailed photo when I blow up to 16x20 (the largest I have printed so far with this camera.)  There are plenty of reviews of this camera both here and on the net so for my 2 cents:1) This isn't a camera for everyone, you are paying for RAW, a fairly fast lens and bigger sensor2) The RX seems to go through the battery fairly quickly, so buy a couple of spares3) As others have mentioned, the start video button is inconveniently located and easy to turn on accidently4) The camera has lots of features, I found a secondary handbook on how to use it, was helpfulIf you want a cheap point and shoot, you'd probably do better looking elsewhere.

It is the most compact and has the largest sensor and a very fast lens.  It's also got extremely fast focus and shot-to-shot time.  So overall it's excellent for travel or for concert photos.  Even though the optical zoom is only 3.6x because of the large sensor and 20mp photo size, you can use the fancy digital zoom without much degradation.Alas, the Sony RX100 is not perfect.  The audio quality for concerts is not as good as the G9 or G10.  At loud volumes (e.g. 100db) there will be some distortion (e.g. clipping) of the audio.

I have used a Canon EOS 40D SLR with a VERY EXPENSIVE lens that has been great over the years, but I always wanted to have something that wasn't such a pain to lug around on my family trips without feeling like I was making too much of a sacrifice in image quality. I have tried multiple other premium pocket cameras, but this RX100 is stunning to say the least. My very first shot of my son in difficult lighting in the house had that awesome SLR quality look to it and bokeh effect, and I was sold from the first shot :)The auto focus on this thing is insanely fast, and the noise/grain on these 20 megapixel images even when blown up to 100% \"pixel peeping\" on my computer is impressive to say the least. My 40D was only 10 megapixels, so when resizing my RX100 images to those dimensions it is even more impressive to me that they have managed to get that type of image quality out of a 1\" image sensor in that small pocket camera. The ability to tilt the built-in flash back with your thumb a little to get a built-in \"bounce flash\" is also very cool, and the results from my initial simple tests using this method were pretty good.If you are into taking pictures that have high quality and would like to take something that is less of a burden on you dragging around equipment all day, then this is THE CAMERA that you have been waiting for!

The first RX100 reviews amazed me, but my first thought was: 20MP is too much, 16MP would have been better for a 1 inch sensor. My LX3 had 10MP and made marvelous photos, so 10MP is already enough. What matters at the end of the day is pixel size, since the weakness of ourdays digital shooting is limited dynamic range (ever seen a 80 years old black and white tripod photo made from a 10x10 cm negative ? - breathtaking quality), and dynamic range is, in a first approximation, bound to pixel size. If I do the math, I find that the LX3 has a 1/1.63 inch sensor with 10MP, the RX100 has a 1 inch sensor with 20MP, so the each RX100 pixel is about 41% larger than a LX3 pixel. Not too big a difference.The RX100 is not yet (early August 2012)  in the shops in Germany, so I bought it online from sony.de. Without going into details about this experience: never do it. A letter listing all the mishaps, slip-ups and bugs of my online and telephone service experiences is on its way to the CEO.The camera arrived July 20th. First impression: while my LX3 gives a sturdy impression, with the RX100 I felt and still feel as if I have to be very cautious with this little body. If you switch it on, the lens walks amazingly far out and speaks \"do not touch me, your touch might derange my glasses\". Not to mention the toy flash.Second cry was for a decent manual. May be NY-Times D.Pogue is able to master the plethora of menu options without manual, I am not. Fortunately I found the online-HTML manual soon, and even more fortunately I found a hint how to convert this into a PDF I was not aware of. Here it is:Open Acrobat Reader ProClick FileClick create pdfChoose from Web PageEnter sony online manual URL into box on top(click sign), Choose \"Get entire site\"There I was sitting one entire afternoon studying the manual. Wow, how many options. Most are restricted to JPEG. Which more or less makes sense. I would like to have available the auto-HDR or long exposure noise reduction as well for RAW, but OK. And the quality of JPEGs is amazing. I compared a RAW and a JPEG side by side in Lightroom: there is some more sharpness with RAW, yes, but JPEGS are still impressive, and those many creative modes are fun to play with. You can generate all these effects in Photoshop, probably better, but to have those easily accesssible via firmware with a few clicks is fun.However, there is no RAW converter yet for Lightroom. First I used Sony's \"Image data converter\". This software is not ashamed to blow up a 20MB raw file into a 100MB Tiff, which can be used in Lightroom. Later I found \"Raw Photo Processor 64\" which generates TIFFs of still 35MB. Compare this to 5MB JPEGs, and you know why I always toggle between \" I want highest quality whatsoever\" and \"do not fill up  your time mashine backup unwarily\".One weekend I did not use the camera, and the battery was drained afterwards. Completely. To the point I could not charge it via Laptop-USB: the yellow charge LED did switch on and off and on. I could not re-animate my brand new camera ! Fortunately, next morning charging worked again with constant lighting yellow LED and full charge after 6 hours. This was a bit shocking, in particular since I do not know how it could happen. Was the play button pressed inadvertently in my pocket, which switches the camera on just like the power button ? But than it should have automatically switched off after 2 minutes. Maybe a firmware update should remove the ability to switch the camera on with the play button: in contrast to the power button, which is \"in a sink\" the play button sticks up. Or offer me a slim (and maybe waterproof) case.Overall, I am quite happy with this little Wunderkind, although whenever I get it out of the pocket there is still a tiny fear I could bump or break it.

But for a pro, this is the camera that you'll always have with you. With a 1\" sensor, a Ziess lens, and 20mp of resolution, this often serves as my first camera. In may ways it rivals my Canon 1Ds mk3. With modern processing software you can mitigate what little noise there is, the lens is sharp as a tack... just amazing, and the tiny size beats the competition hands down. My old go-to \"pocket\" camera was a Canon G series (10-12). As good as those cameras are, they don't hold a candle to the RX. As for the interchangeable little mirrorless cameras, I wasn't looking for a replacement for my 1Ds3, I wanted something I could carry with me, preferably in my pocket and still made RAW files, and had a decent little zoom. The RX100 did all that and far more.If you want to quibble, I can say that Sony can't write software to save their lives. The menu system, while not as bad as some, is still a pain to use. Too many things are buried and hard to access (manual focus???). The \"ring\" on the front of the camera seemed like a good idea, but has proved to be mostly unusable.

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, as I feel that it lives up to the quality for both stills and video that I was hoping for when I bought it.  However, there are a few short-comings, some of which are not the fault of Sony or the camera and which I expect to be remedied down the road.  They include:- RAW files are not yet compatible with Lightroom, which is something I really wanted.  I'm sure this will be solved pretty soon.- Similarly, 1080/60p AVCHD video is not compatible with iMovie or Final Cut Pro X on the Mac yet.  I'm hoping this will happen down the road.  For now, I shoot in 60i, which works fine and still looks good.- Sony supplies no software for Mac, but I would use my third-party programs anyway.- When zooming in video, once you hit the end of the optical zoom, it kicks into digital zoom that degrades the quality.  This can't be turned off, which is a real dumb oversight.  However, there is a noticeable spot where this happens, so you can usually catch it and keep from going there (at least too far).- When shooting stills with the standard 2-second preview on and then trying to quickly change the zoom level for the next shot, it instead applies the zoom control to the preview mode and keeps it locked in that mode, so that you have to manually get back to camera mode.  This got so annoying that I turned off preview mode altogether and just manually used the play mode button to see the photos I just shot.  I couldn't figure out how to turn this off.- The build is generally solid, but as others have noted, the flash feels flimsy and makes me worry that eventually it might break.  Also, I had the battery door on the bottom open by itself several times, which was somewhat disconcerting.  The latch for that is pretty weak.- The manual was a joke, as others have mentioned.  I found the online one, but it's a live web site, not a PDF you can download and keep.  I imagine they will fix that eventually.Those are pretty much all my gripes, which prevent me from giving this camera a full 5-stars.  Still, the image quality and video quality are both excellent.  I had this camera along with a Canon 60D with an L-series lens on my vacation, and while it couldn't quite keep up with the Canon (as expected), I still was very happy with the photos it took and could watch them alongside the Canon photos without feeling that they were drastically inferior.  The video was also very clear and nice, even when shooting indoors in regular lighting, which has given me problems with other cameras in the past.  Given the form factor of the camera, which made it easy to take lots of places I didn't want to drag the DSLR, plus the very good low-light performance, especially when you don't zoom in, it's definitely a keeper for me.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "RickW \"rickw\"", "ReviewID": "RSKUNCJC583U7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I admit I'm not a great photographer.I use a camera when I travel, and keep it in my pants pocket.

As the years went by and I became more and more tired of lugging DSLRs around and compromising my desire for a pocketable camera with cameras that you had to squeeze into a large coat pocket, I came across the RX100.  I had a Fuji X10, which was extremely well built and had a great optical view finder, however, it did not fit in my pants pocket, it's image quality was good, but not quite what I wanted.  It had a hit and miss auto focus and it's low light performance left a bit to be desired.Admittedly, the RX100 is expensive when compared to others, but you get what you pay for.  In this case, you are paying for exceptional image quality (as good as some DSLRs) with excellent auto focus, good low light performance and clean images.

There are times I dont wanna bring my dslr because of the size and in some occasion I wished I had a decent camera with me. I was looking at M4/3 and even the Sony NEX's but bringing a lens or combination of lens is somehow a hassle. So, a fix lens or something that slips into my pocket is the only right choice but looking and reading the Specs on most point and shoot cameras are dissapointing...the downside is, small sensors. I dont care what everyone says but Im not a firm believer that a sensor smaller than an inch yield high quality pictures, There are some cameras that are exceptionssuch as the G series of the Canon line and well known brand like Sony. Then the Nikon V1 came out but still it didn't convinced me strong enough to pull the trigger. I know it's a good quality camera and the technological advances it packs in such a small form factor camera but I needed something with a fix lens. The G1X and G15 of Canon are good candidates but they are still big as a pocket camera. Then Sony RX100 came out, read the specs, and finally oredered it from Amazon. My first reaction when I opened the box like a kid opening a box of toy was the size. This camera is packed with technology in a small form factor which I really want. I like the feel, its solid metal and it doesn't feel cheap. Overall construction is superb and the lens..my favorite, Carl Zeiss lens with a \"T\" designation. It takes stunning picture and it beats my T2i with kit lens attach. Sony's color, clarity,and contrast is hard to beat. Im still a Canon fan and uses Canon 5dII and few L lenses and one of which is the 24-105mm IS USM L. As I have mentioned earlier, its just a huge gear to pack all the time.

Over-all a great camera experience - super picture and video quality as other reviewers rave about.  Incredibly small, but heavy for the size with a nice solid feel.  Very nice controls, UI, and easy to customize.  Amazing lcd screen - not having a view finder has not been an issue, even on a sunny day on a boat.Two main issues so far:1) Super slippery plastic on the front left side (where your right hand grips it) makes me wonder how long it will be before I drop it.  In fact the first 'real' picture I took from the camera almost didn't happen - it nearly slipped out of my hand when I pulled it out of my camera case and went overboard on the first day.  I don't like wrist straps, and want to keep it small enough for a pocket so using a case all the time doesn't work for me.  Why didn't Sony use a plastic that was rough enough to provide some grip in the front?  Or even better put a little rubber strip down the front side where your finger tips rest.  Didn't they read any of the reviews of the Canon S90 / S95 / S100 where people complained about trouble gripping the earlier models?  Does Sony want to repeat that history?  It's not a deal breaker, but this tiny camera does have some heft to it so you really do need something to hold on to. The choice of form over function here is a design flaw that is really inexcusable.  Few would pay $650 for a good looking camera... those of us who will want a super-functional camera.  Arg.  So unnecessary to have this problem.2) My old camera (canon a710is) generates movies that download automatically with my pics to my macbook pro running snow leopard.  This Sony generates movies in a much better format, but it looks like I'm going to have to do some work to figure out how to even download them to my computer (they don't get copied over automatically with the pics).  And when I finally do get them on the macbook, according to what I've read, I'm either going to have to upgrade iPhoto (I have a 2006 or so version), find some shareware app to view the avchd format, or buy a fancy editing/viewing program (FCP or APS?).

Let me back up: I originally purchased the RX100M2 when it was released; however , I didn't think it was the camera for me when I began reading that photos in this camera were better than the original RX100 only in RAW.  I don't shoot in RAW - about this time the price began decreasing on the original RX100 - to the point where there was over a $200- $250 difference. I loved the rotating screen and the WIFI ability - and while it had better low light capability - I didn't see a huge difference that would merit spending all of this extra cash. So I returned the camera to where I purchased it from and purchased the RX100 (for a little over $500). I also got the Gary Friedman book on how to use the camera. I studied the book for a few weeks - testing out what I learned and voila for how I believe I will use the camera I was completely satisfied. It's a small camera - it's intended to be carried in your pocket - like a smart phone (although there is no way to compare the photo capability of a smart phone with this camera). Does it take photos like a full size DSLR? Maybe! I guess it comes down to how critical one is. The camera takes better photos than many camera (I'll leave it at that) - and most of the cameras slightly ahead of this camera cannot fit in your pocket. To the reviewer below here that complained about the menus: I am not the most technical person around (I'd give myself a 7 out of 10); yet, I found the menus very easy to navigate.

I've been through lots of formats and equipment keeping up with technonogy and I can't say for sure, but this might just be where my need for more and better ends.  A couple of years back I bought a highly rated super-zoom camera (won't mention the brand as the best of them have the same flaws) that had 12 mp and videoed in AVCHD. Anything better would have required stepping up to a DSLR and multiple lenses and more nonsense than I was already used to.  It didn't take long to realize the fatal flaws of the super zooms, lousey optics, poor low light images and videos, still larger than a point and shoot.  Fine for family night but no photo images to be any more proud of (and maybe less so)than my 48 yr old 35mm SLR. With an upcoming two week Lifetime trip to China it was time to step up to the cash register once more (er-ah hit the add to cart button).  I picked up my Sony DCS RX 100 at the UPS shipping facility in Redmond WA. at 9AM the same day we left on our trip at 2:30PM.  Bearly enough time to charge the Batteries and fly through the instructions to learn how to turn it on (actually it's incredibly intuitive if you have any recent vintage point and shoot. Included instructons are almost non-existent but cover the basics.)  Knowing I would not have time on tours etc. to do much else, I had already decided to stick primarily to the IA position and point, and shoot.  I did, and I have been amazed at how easy it was to get great looking photos under a variety of lighting conditions.  Pictures, tons of pictures.  Rapid fire shots. night shots of buildings at night.  Pictures from the busses (OK  there's no way to get great pics through the window of a bus but some weren't that bad). And video. Under all lighting conditions. With a dedicated video button there's no need to dial up the video position. And press the shoot button  during a video and you can take a photo with no interruption. I brought my 10.5\" tablet along and was amazed when I saw the enlarged pics. The lens isn't a super zoom, 3.5x maxing out at 100mm, but with a HUGE (for a point and shoot) 1\" CMOS sensor, a 1.8 Carl Zeiss lense system and 20.2 megapixles you can blow up anything taken at less than 1/100 sec. with little loss of detail.  One comment.  I really did stick to IA for all shooting.  I discovered the dedicated panorama position at about day 3 and it's amazing too.  Only after returning home did I check out the IA+ position on the dial and realize I should probably have done all my shooting in this position (I tried a couple of test shots under low light condition and saw little difference but who knows). I took all video in the MP4 codec (plays on my tablet natively and most other places on the web) but it will also record .264, 720 or 1080.  Day or night, light or dark, the results, again, amazing. I have to mention the LCD, which is the brightest I've ever seen in bright sunlight. Usually I can't see a thing on the screen in bright sunlight so I tend toward viewfinders and this Sony only has an LCD.  But I could always see what I was shooting or filming, even with the sun behind me. China is truely an amazing country to visit. Most worthwhile 2 weeks of any trip I've ever taken, and I can hold beautiful memories of it all in my pocket.  Thanks, Sony, for making what will probably be my last photo/video product. A final point here about the 3.5x zoom lense.  Anything greater with today's technology and there's a loss of quality, period.  And whether for pics or video, unless you're using great quality tripod equipment and take a lot of time, counterproductive.  Past 100mm it's pretty much impossible to hand hold a still or video (especially video) camera and produce an image worth viewing.  On our China trip I did not once find a desire to xoom in any closer than the camera allowed.  And if there were, you can enable digital zooming for still shooting and no-loss Hd electronic zooming for video.  That's the advantage of the huge CMOS sensor and the 20 megapixles that are available.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great small camera at a price", "Author": "EmilyandNick", "ReviewID": "R3UMP0SMFDVNMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've been using this camera for a few months now and decided it's time for a review.Deciding what to rate the camera is the hard part.What do we like? - It's small/reasonably light but has a comparatively larger sensor size. - IQ is excellent for something of this size. - It's a nice looking camera. - Has pretty good low light performance. - Useful when you don't want to lug a bigger DSLR around everywhere. - Superior intelligent auto mode.What's ok? - The camera has plenty of good features but not necessarily that intuitive. - The ring around the lens is not tactile enough but does a job.What's not to like? - The price - being Sony, they will always charge a premium for their products. - It's one of the more complex/harder to use cameras out there if you are trying to go beyond the basic auto mode.We're not pro-photographers so this would be more aimed at people considering a high end compact.

Like having 3 programmable modes.- Stability - I thought the default 1/30 shutter would be too slow but most pictures appear sharp.----------------Here is what I view as the incredibly dumb decisions...- The out of box setting of Auto-DRO causes lower quality images.  Why set the default as worse quality?  I think some of the claims of poor image quality relate to this decision.- Crummy manual and no manual in box.  If Sony wants users to take great pictures, give us the information needed.  I realize that big manuals cost a lot to translate for world wide distribution, but the current situation is really unforgivable.  The internet community may close this gap in time.----------------Here are things I personally dislike, but some could debate as everything is a tradeoff...- In program mode, I'd like to have the option of setting a minimum Aperture and Shutter.  I find F1.8 to have too shallow depth of field for a lot of my situations and 1/30 can sometimes be too slow.  Yes, I can use Aperture priority, but then it frequently picks 1/30 for the shutter.  If that is too slow, I'm stuck with Manual which requires setting Aperture, Shutter and ISO.  At that point I've missed the shot.- The tripod has to be removed to access memory/battery.- I wish for a VF or articulating display.  Just personal preference.- I loved Canon Vivid setting and have not been able to reproduce it.  Anyone have ideas?- Miss the flexibility to customize self-timer to take xxx pictures after yyy time.- Why can't I customize the top, bottom, zoom toggle, and movie buttons?- When selecting things in Fn menus, I naturally turn the dial the opposite of the way it expects.  I'm sure I'll learn but it seems backwards.  Turning clockwise, moves the selector to the item in the counter-clockwise direction.  I realize it is trying to simulate moving a really dial but it doesn't register with me.  I'm too use to using a mouse where you move toward what you are selecting.  Wish I had an option to reverse it.- I miss external battery charger, but I tried Anker Multi-Purpose Universal Rapid Cell phone Battery Charger for Samsung: Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy S II S2 i9100, T-mobile T989, AT&T; i777, Skyrocket SGH-I727; HTC: Sensation, Sensation XE, Amaze, EVO 3D, ThunderBolt; Motorola: Verizon Droid RAZR, Droid X... with the battery in Special Value Accessory Kit for the Sony DSC-RX100 and it works fine.- Settings for on screen display during shooting could be improved.  Some are very cluttered.  Would like more options to have the horizontal level shown.- If Sony decides to not do Firmware updates, I would view this as a major omission.

The zoom is about the same, but the Panasonic has better f-stop. Still, 1.8 is better than your average camera, many of which are (commonly) 2.8 or 3.5.Image quality. Yes, an NEX has less noise at higher ISO because of its sensor 10mm larger (13mm on RX100 versus 23mm on NEX; APS-C). The sensor on the RX100 is 1\", compared to the Panasonic at 1/1.7; 7-8mm. That said, the RX100's sensor is twice the size of the LX7 with twice the resolution (20MP versus 10MP). For example, the Sony CyberShot DSC-HX30V has the small 1/2.3\" sensor (a few mm), but amazingly, at 18MP, the pictures at a higher ISO look hardly worse than at base ISO. Colors (indoors) are about the same on the HX30V, RX100, and NEX (I have all of these, the NEX-5N is the one I tested with the other two in my kitchen). Details are smudged a little on the HX30V, but that is due to the aggressive noise reduction. Amazingly, the highest ISO of 12800 on the HX30V is very good if you remain still enough. I got a very clean photo of my kitchen at night with extremely dim light from nearby yardlights. This seemed comparable to ISO 6400 on the RX100, but highlight clipping and noise were more of a problem. I am thinking that the noise reduction algorithm on the HX30V is superior to the other cameras mentioned. *** Yes, disregard what I said about the sensor. The sensor specs can confuse you. I will get to this matter in a short bit. ***Movie quality. They are all very clean in good and low light. The sound quality suffers equally; 48KHz sounds lossy (mathematical phenomenon, perhaps), where a camera such as Canon T3i (again, I have that one) records at 44.1KHz (CD-quality), the quality you would expect from a music CD.Hardware. The NEX doesn't focus as well or as quickly as the RX100, but the HX30V is the fastest, putting the RX100 in the middle. I haven't done very thorough testing yet, but what I am referring to is taking pictures out a car window (down) going about 35-40 mph. An NEX won't give you a clear shot, due to its slow lens with severe motion blur. The RX100 does a little better; closer objects with stronger motion blur than distant ones (zooming in, the results may be worse). The HX30V is so fast that most of the time, the images are clear, although the grass on the side of the road has some motion blurring. I am wondering if the smaller sensor on the HX30V makes a difference. In any case, an NEX series camera gives the best image quality, but the lenses (and no in-body stabilization) makes them good for still shooting. In addition, some focus hunting (contrast detection versus the much faster and more costly phase detection autofocus) occurs to an extent on any of these cameras. Whatever the reason, using progressive AVCHD seems to improve the quality, but that is most likely because the other formats are interlaced. What makes this partially NEX hardware, or a bit closer 'in the middle' is that the sensor is larger. I happened to question someone at work about the sensor at work, and what I was told is that the sensor size is the end result of a mathematical formula, not the actual size of the sensor. Therefore, using basic geometry to measure with a ruler isn't going to result in one inch. Do some research to find out if interested. Performance isn't quite up to the HX30V, but better than the NEX series. As said, this camera falls in the middle, so it is a better value than the NEX for roughly the same price range, but the NEX has the larger sensor for cleaner high-ISO images. Movies are the same, except for the following under software...Software. First, the user interface is that of the CyberShot (the RX100 is CyberShot, which makes sense). However, its features are very close to that found on the NEX series, hence, some limitations. This mostly applies to the Movie Mode, where the NEX-5N, for instance, can record Art Effects as does for photos, but on the HX30V, those art filters aren't available for Movie Mode, and so you're basic with shooting in color. The HX5V didn't even have B&W; and Sepia for photos, so this is a welcome feature that should have been available as on many other cameras, such as Canon and Panasonic. On the RX100, I like the interface in the middle; like the NEX the least, and the HX series the best. The biggest gripe that I have, and it doesn't seem to make sense, is that the RX100 and NEX series don't support 720 (1280 x 720); just the standard VGA (MP4 640 x 480) and HD (MP4 1440 x 1080; AVCHD [MTS] 1920 x 1080)). The NEX series supports 24fps in progressive format for HD, but the RX100 cannot, and so the only progressive format is the 60fps that cannot allow dual recording (taking stills while recording), and the picture quality suffers on the RX100 as does the HX series during movie mode. NEX series cannot take photos during movie mode. I like it that the NEX and RX100 can display MP4, AVCHD, or photos, but not everything in playback mode. This is useful if you want to show someone photos but not movies, or movies without the photos. This is unusual in that I know of no other camera makers that do this, but then Sony did not give the option to disable this so that everything on the card can be displayed in the order they were written. Another minor bugbear with the RX100 and NEX is they do not have internal memory. You have 105 MB of internal storage on the HX30V, far better than the much smaller capacity on the HX9V (last year's model) that can take just three photos. HX30V, for example, cannot record movies of any resolution internally, as you can on Panasonic DMC-FZ35 (I have that one), but can only record at QVGA (320 x 240) for about 75 seconds in ample light.Given the limitations, I would say that this camera is very good, but not excellent. Still, the best compact on the market as of late, but I think that it should be more in the price range of the Panasonic DMC-LX7, but due to the smaller sensor yet brighter lens, still, the value between the two should be very close.In conclusion, I would probably rate the LX7 four stars if I were to own one, but because the Sony RX100 is substantially more expensive, the LX7 would be a better value unless you can find the RX100 used (usually for less) or wait until the next generation (model).Panasonic wins on this one for the price, but the Sony wins for image quality, and that is my view. If you do not mind slightly impressionistic photos but great performance and excellent image stabilization in very low light, the HX30V is the best you can do with a small image sensor for even less than the LX7.The RX100 is in direct competition, as the LX7 comes up often when you search for RX100 online. (I have not yet written my review on the HX30V, and it may be a while before I do so.)

In two weeks of my ownership with this camera I am totally left confused if I need anything better for family photography. This camera is more than adequate to get 'fantastic' pictures in all conditions (indoor, low light night clubs, outdoor, fast moving kids, sports). If there is anything you will ever feel missing will be the zoom range. But even that can be compensated in a way as the 20MP leaves room to get good enough pictures after good amount of cropping.If not for my fascination to shoot with legacy lenses with my NEX-7, I would have made this my only camera beside my cellphone. This camera is way better than buying any DSLR (around $700 range( and settling with cheap kit lens as RX100 has much faster and better lens than any kit lens that come with DSLRs. It will be almost impossible to be disappointed with picture quality this gem outputs.Can't wait to get update to Adobe LIghtroom that supports RAW pictures of this camera.

Sim \"j. sim\"", "ReviewID": "R11W8T5AVWY6O6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: I'm just a regular woman with no special knowledge of camera tech.My husband and I went into an intense debate about which camera we should buy with the upcoming arrival of our first child. We currently old a Canon SD800 that is too slow and a SLR which is too big for us to carry around along with all the baby stuff. He really wanted us to go with the NEX-6 whereas I gravitated more to the RX100. I think essentially, we want different things and we have different goals! Once we established that this camera was primarily for MOM (i.e. me), it was easy to decide why this camera was awesome for ME.- Small and light. I can throw this into a purse no problem. Love it!- One-time purchase. I won't have to buy multiple lenses for different uses. This is one size fits all for 80% of the situations I am in. So even though it is the most expensive compact out there, I actually save more in the long run because I know I won't be blowing more cash on additional lens.- Great for low-light and super fast lens for babies! I don't know the technical specs at all, but this camera meets that criteria when I tested it in the Sony store.- Easy to use and no need to muck around too much with settings. The \"intelligent mode\" is pretty awesome but I do switch between that and \"A\" and \"P\" mode so I can adjust the aperture with the ring to tell the camera what to focus on.- Friends have asked me why not the canon s100? Easy, the sensor size!!! I have no idea what it really means to be honest but I like knowing something about this camera is just as good as the NEX series which should in theory set it in a different class from the other P&S.;Cons:- Unfortunately, one of the biggest reasons why I didn't shoot before was that it was a pain to get pictures of our SLR. I really really wished the RX100 came with wifi but I know that would have compromised on size. I did pick up an eye-fi card and it actually does the job quite well.

I noticed after a week that every time I tried to use it the battery was dead.  After observing it for awhile, I noticed that it would turn itself on without being touched or moved in any way. First the viewer turned in, then the lenses popped out and the whole thing fired up. I tried to figure it out but finally decided it was just broken.  Unfortunately I waited one day too long to return it to Amazon, so had to send it back to Sony.  That was three weeks ago.  If I get it back soon and it works alright I'll figure I just got a dud and will upgrade this review.  If it still has a problem I'll downgrade it to one star.  But from what I read from other reviewers my problem is not unique.Update:  after 3 weeks, I got the camera back from Sony.  The tech did not read the letter explaining the problem, tested the battery and pronounced it good, then returned the camera without actually fixing it.  Useless.Update 2:  After giving up on the useless Sony technical support, I took self-help and foisted the turkey back on Sony at their store.  The replacement so far has not exhibited the same problems.  I took it on a 10 day trip to Rome and did not have to charge it once.  The pictures I took came out well.  What I particularly like about the camera is the size.  I LOVED being able to carry it in my pocket knowing that it can take as good a picture as most of the massive DSLRs I saw other people lugging around.  I LOVED being able to take pictures in any light without a flash.  The controls are easy to operate.  Frankly, though, I care much more about the artistic aspect of photography than the technical.  I found it laughable to see yet another person using their expensive camera to take yet another picture of the Colosseum, as though something novel might be revealed.  A good picture is unexpected, and depends more on the eye of the photographer than the equipment s/he is using.  The size of this camera makes it discrete, and that helps capture the unique moment.  The sophistication of the RX100 makes it possible to do that with technical quality as well.Overall, a big thumbs up to the camera, and a big thumbs down to Sony service (hence the 4 star rating not 5).", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Problem in humid climate", "Author": "D Walls", "ReviewID": "R3SPVMFHPVEE0B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My RX 100 is my 2nd Sony camera.

Guess what, the image quality suffers from a moving camera.  Even on a bright day the focus isn't as sharp as a still photo.  Add to that that you are not shooting as tall an image (1856 versus 3648 vertical pixels).

While the RAW files are not yet supported by the big apps (e.g., Photoshop) that is sure to come in the very near future, so no worries there. Lack of hot-shoe for external flash is no big problem as the metering works fine with slave flashes (my Metz 28 CS-2 does a beautiful job with this thing). Lack of external microphone jack is a shame really given its awesome video capabilities, but I can live with it given my limited use of the video feature. The biggest miss for me is a horizontal thumb wheel at the top right corner to control the ISO (or even aperture if you want a one handed operation). Yes you can use the vertical wheel but that has two limitations - it is shared among so many important adjustments that you need to constantly switch between them (metering mode, flash mode, ISO, AF mode, shooting mode, etc.), so you often need a two step process to change anything, and also the vertical wheel is hard to use with your thumb lowered to it without losing your grip on the camera (so you end up pressing it hard to ensure a tight grip, but guess what - that clicks it and you change an adjustment. The wheel is also a 4-way switch).All said, it's a superb compact, if about $200 too expensive.

I ordered this camera over 2 months ago and have read every review on the internet I could find.  Still actually having the camera with all the features seams overwhelming.  I started with list in hand to set all the adjustments I knew I would want like picture size and aspect ratio, steady shot on both pictures and movies.  I only use flash when I have to so I turned it off etc.  Then I set it for JPEG/RAW.  My goal was to Photoshop the RAW versions of those JPEG's that you just can't get the color or detail right.  What I found is currently Photoshop does not support the RX100.  That should change in a few months so I will continue to shoot that way on my next trip.Size matters and although it fits in a pocket I recommend a case attached to your belt.  I was hoping it would fit into the case for my Cybershot but it's just a little too big.  I'm currently using a case I got with some small binoculars 15 years ago and am still looking.  My needs may be different from most.  I need a small, quick to use camera that I can carry with me on trips.  I shoot inside and outside at all times of the day or night and many times with little advance notice.  When I return I spend hours turning the pictures and movies into DVD's to share with family and friends.  What can I say, it's my hobby.  I've found I won't watch hours of camcorder movies or look through photo albums but I will grab a DVD and of a trip and watch it.I too would like a separate battery charger and in the accessories mentioned in the literature with my camera Sony has one.  Don't get too excited though.  It says it will be available in July but so far they are not offering it on their website and neither is any other vendor offering one.

Buried in the menu is a large section of tips about how to set this camera for various shots.  It's like the missing manual.  They tell you how to make adjustments to auto to defocus the background, change the picture temp, change the ISO and vividness as an example.  The more I play with this camera the more I like it.  So far I've taken and deleted about 140 pictures just for practice.  Some minor concerns.  The battery life seems shorter than advertised and the door covering the charging USB seems fragile.

And the flash was too bright indoors - had to adjust settings, became a headache.  So it started collecting dust.So, I jumped on the Canon S110 only to be very disappointed.  Why?  Photo quality wasn't much better than the rest of the PowerShot line up.  And the HD video had lousy focusing system (vs Sony and LUMX).  Not enough zoom either.  So I sold her.I then tested out the Fuji XF1 and was very pleased - seemed to take both excellent indoor and outdoor stills, great white balance, worked perfectly on the AUTO settings too (unlike Canon and LUMIX) and video focusing seemed to track fairly well.  larger sensor than the S110 too.I didn't own the LX& but those I spoke to who did, complained about AUTO still quality and didn't like having to use P Mode and customize settings.

The primary use for me is in a housing to be used while scuba diving.  I will say that for the above water pictures I have taken I am quite impressed with it.  Overall the camera has a good feel (solid/sturdy/metal feel), but there's not a real good \"hand grip\" like the DSLRs have, which is disappointing.  I can understand the desire to keep it small, but it would have been nice to just have a mounting point to put on a handle so one hand could hold the camera nicely.So far I have taken 2 (scuba diving) trips with it.  The initial trip I used one of my son's strobes (Inon Z240) and a L&M; Sola 1200 as a Video/flood light.  For my 2nd trip I purchased 2 S&S; D1 Strobes.This is my first foray into underwater photography using a \"camera\".  Up until now I carted a long a L&M; Video Housing for my Sony HDR-HC3 Hi Def video camcorder.  This can also take pictures but only at 4 MP (it's not a new camera by any stretch of the imagination).  But since I didn't have to worry about any settings I used it pretty much like a point & shoot.My first week was on a Digital Shootout sponsored by BackScatter on Cozumel in late April.  We had some instruction on uw photography, but, as I quickly found out, nothing beats just getting in the water and shooting, shooting, shooting.  I set my RX100 on Aperture Priority (as recommended) and played around.  My picture quality is anywhere from pretty decent to horrible.  I still need quite a bit more time to flesh out all the operations of this thing.  That would be true for almost any camera these days - the electronics in them provides so much functionality that learning it is almost a bit overwhelming.*** During my experience I did notice one HUGE hole in the camera's capabilities and that is that it is limited to F11.  Both of my sons cameras have a better range and they are much older than this one so it's more than a bit disappointing.  The two other cameras (FYI) are an Olympus PEN-1 (12 mp) in an Olympus housing (Z240 & S2000 strobes) and a Canon T2i in an Aquatica Housing (which has caused us NO END of problems due to extremely poor design) with one single D1 strobe and a L&M; Sola 1200 Video/Flood light.  Even the older PEN-1 Olympus goes to an aperture of F22.I also got the macro and wide angle UW lenses that mated to the housing.  I still have to review some of these pictures but getting to within an inch or so of some of these tiny subjects is just amazing.  I did have one issue with the Wide Angle Lens but since this is all UW related I won't burden you with it here.So, time will tell whether I keep using this as a primary camera or buy a real DSLR and relegate this to a backup function.BTW, for those other users complaining about no external battery charger - you can buy one (it came in my package).

Using the Coolpix A what really bugs me is the lack of actual zoom on this thing and the slow autofocus on this thing as well. Lastly there is an annoying thing where there is a little switch on the side to switch to between: macro, auto focus and manual focus. The lack of image stabilization is another bad thing the RX100 lens does have image stabilization.RX100 advantages does have faster auto focus, in superior auto you do not need to physically hit a switch to go in between macro and auto focus. (it does what it suppose to do auto detect that its a macro picture or other scene options) The Macro on the RX100 is also significantly better as well, I prefer the macro on the RX100 as I can get a closer shot to the object before the focus does not work anymore.But do realize in real world situations a faster auto focus, image stabilization will generally snap you a better picture than a camera with slower auto focus especially when you are using auto mode on these two cameras. Where the RX100 shines is the faster auto focus being able to snap multiple pictures at once and choosing the best picture of the bunch it snaps. To me if you want an all around camera the RX100 would be the definite choice but if you are maybe just taking pictures of landscapes or non moving pictures on a tripod the Coolpix A might be a better choice.If you google rx100 vs coolpix a you'll find spec comparisons and reasons why you might wind up falling in love the RX100 over the coolpix A.

However, it takes amazing pictures in all conditions.You sometimes do need to get involved manually (the flash over-exposes at short range, for example), and all controls are there for you.The large pixel count somewhat compensates for the short telephoto. There're enough pixels to crop in most case.Below is my first-impression review.About me:I've been an amateur photographer for thirty years now.Started with manual SLR and than moved to AF SLR.In 2000, my SLR was lost/stolen. Getting a film camera at that time seemed like the wrong thing to do, so I bought my first digital camera. Since DSLRs at the time started at $3000, I went for a \"prosumer\" camera. The Minolta Dimage7.I loved that camera. It had the control I wanted,  a decent 28-200mm lens, and was much smaller than my SLR.A few years ago, I decided to buy a cheap point-and-shoot, so I can carry it with me while biking or skying (didn't want to risk my \"good\" camera).Over time, I noticed that I'm using the POS more and more, and the other camera less and less.Apparently size matters...About this camera:So when I decided to get a decent camera again, it was obvious I am not going back to an SLR, or even a ZLR.I looked at ILCs, and really liked the Sony NEX6, But that camera is still quite bulky.The RX100 is everything I expected it to be.It can be used as a point-and-shoot, with very good results. So anyone in the family can use it.It can also be used as a manual camera, with almost every control option available. It's customizable, so you can place the controls you care about at your fingertips.Even in \"Super Auto\" mode, you can go into \"creative mode\" and control depth of field, exposure, color saturation etc. without needing to know how those actually work. A great way to introduce someone to photography IMO.A great camera for anyone looking to take great pictures with something that fits in a large pocket.What could be better:Telephoto.

It's just such a hassle for me, when I can just use my phone or iPod to snap photos on the go.  Until now, previous point & shoots just weren't worth it to carry around when the quality was comparable to photos taken my my phone.When I heard about the RX100, I wasn't sure if I could justify a $650 point & shoot.  After about two weeks and reading at least two dozen reviews and viewing flickr galleries taken with the RX100, I finally decided to go ahead and order it.  I will be moving to Japan in a month, so I figured it will be a worthwhile investment.  Plus the value in always having a camera on you is priceless.  For $650 though, I debated if I should just get a Sony NEX5 instead...  it is a little bigger than an RX100, lighter/smaller than my Canon Rebel T3i.  The reason I didn't is I didn't want to fall into the habit or purchasing lens for yet another camera.So far, the image quality has been pretty good.  Photos are great.  Taking high-quality HD videos is a cinch (just get a 64 GB memory card and maybe an extra battery).

It has more features than I could use in a lifetime and will probably do anything most people would ever need or want to do.However, it has no optical viewfinder, just the digital screen, and I cannot see it well enough to compose photos outdoors. I knew there was no OVF, but a respected reviewer for a major newspaper swore that it was easy to see in bright sun. Maybe for him; not for me.After using the camera at an outdoor music festival over one weekend, I packed it up and sent it back.The technical aspects of this item have been well-covered by other reviewers, so I'll just mention a few things I liked and didn't like.GOOD:I really liked the USB cable that plugs into a PC or an electrical plug - this seems to be standard with electronics now (my iPad and cell phone both have this feature). Some people have objected to having to charge the battery in the camera, but I did not find this to be a problem.I also liked the ability to directly transfer photos to the PC. I have three card readers, none of which work 100%.This is truly a pocket camera, very small, but very solid and heavier than you would expect from its size.There are many other features that I would have used and no doubt liked if I had kept it.Pictures were good, but not better than the DSLR I've been using. Due to my inability to compose, the subject was cut off on the side of some shots and virtually all shots were off level.BAD:No optical viewfinder.Shutter is VERY sensitive. Pushing half-way down to focus was difficult, since \"half-way\" seemed to me about 1/16 of an inch. The shutter went off as soon as I touched it a number of times.The camera has two \"hooks\" on either side for a wrist strap, which can also be connected to a neck strap. They are tiny, and I could not attach the strap, and of course, the instructions don't cover this since Sony probably assumes it's \"obvious.\" This is not minor, since this camera begs to be dropped, and its shape, like a small, smooth brick, provides nothing to help with the grip.The flash location is terrible - on the top left where I put my finger to try to hold the camera. You have to learn to move that finger to the back, which means touching the view screen.You can't delete the pictures from the SD card from within the PC (there's a \"delete all\" option in the camera's seemingly endless menu). Not a big deal, but an extra step.The mode dial, on the top right, seemed to turn too easily. A couple of times it got turned in the process of taking the camera out of my pocket.Transferred photos were saved as read only files; I had to go into Properties to change this before I could save pictures modified in PhotoShop.Bottom line: Test this camera in a store before buying.UPDATES 9/24/12I wanted to mention one more thing that I really liked about this camera - it produces very large .JPG files, around 5 Mb. This allows one to do extreme cropping and still have a great quality photo. I took a horizontal photo of a man on stage, showing the full, mostly empty stage. I cropped it to a vertical image of just the man; still looks great. This is about 1/4 of the total original image, reduced to 1000 pixels high: [...].Clarification: There is no neck strap; there are two adapters that connect to an optional neck strap and also serve as a wrist strap. Could not attach these adapters.What I bought instead: Nikon Coolpix P7100. Has lots of the same features, costs less, and the view monitor was easier to see outdoors.

There's a lot of marketing around, but the reality is it's just an advanced P&S.; Don't expect it will be on par with DSLR or mirrorless cameras. I made a huge mistake when ordered RX100. This was a present for my wife. After reading the reviews and specs there was an impression that in good light conditions it's possible to get IQ similar to IQ of my old NEX5. Not even close! Too many things is wrong with this camera. Poor lens with huge barrel distortion, inaccurate autofocus (very fast though), mediocre AWB, terrible image artifacts even for small ISOs, poor JPEG quality (use RAW instead), too many megapixels for this sensor size, no grip. And you get all this for more than $500. I see only too objective pros: compactness and unusually large sensor for this type of camera. Are these big advantages? It's questionable. RX100 is not much smaller than, say, NEX 3N with a pancake lens. Big sensor should result in a good IQ. To my taste the IQ is not impressive at all. The sensor definitely has a potential, but IQ also depends on the quality of lens and on how you process the data and it seems like these two parts are screwed.I am very disappointed after all. I am returning the camera and ordering NEX 3N with the pancake zoom instead for $350.

Jaffier", "ReviewID": "R2N35URTEW35GD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My goal coming from the Canon s95, was to find a higher quality camera that's still pocketable. I considered an m43 and the NEX line as they're obvious quality upgrades. But the size of those cams with lens takes them out of the pocketable category.  In short, the RX100 is basically the same size as the s95, but leaps and bounds ahead in terms of both picture and video quality. While the s95 did great on sunny outdoor pics, it was questionable in low light indoor situations. The RX100 solves that problem. Low light, no flash, it eats that up.  With flash it's simply amazing.  It's a more powerful flash than the s95 also and both the power and flash direction can be adjusted.  In auto mode, it's quick and pretty accurate.  It also allows you to make quick adjustments even in auto mode.  In manual mode, it seems like everything can be tweaked. I'm no pro, but I felt like one with this camera.Video is amazing.  It's actually as good as my higher end consumer camcorder, especially when shooting outdoors.  Still great indoors, but color is slightly saturated in auto mode.  That can be fixed if you use manual mode or in post with software.  That said, at 60fps full HD is silky smooth.One caveat I learned the hard way is it can over heat when video recording.  4 hrs outside in 99 degree sunny weather, I shot around 150 pics, mostly without flash and 12 mins of video clips.  I saw the \"temperature\" icon appear.  It still let me take pictures however, but not with flash.  The icon disappeared after a minute or so and I could still take short videos.  None of the clips were more than 2 mins in length.  I've done 5 min clips before without problems so I have to assume it was the extreme weather that caused it to balk.Heat concerns aside, I'm glad I chose the RX100.  The quality for both pics and video is as good as pro reviews say it is.  Better than any P&S; I've seen before, but yet still pocketable.

When we are outside during the day, we are typically happy to carry around our DSLR, but going out at night is a different story and that is where this camera came into play. Great shots inside in darker conditions!!!

Wythoff \"Barry loves books\"", "ReviewID": "R3IYBIOY4L5Y2U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after leaving my usual Nikon DSLR with zoom lens and Bogen monopod at the hotel throughout a vacation to Acadia National Park.  After that, I realized it was worth exploring what's available in a quality lightweight compact camera, as I also threw away 80% of the photos taken with my cell phone on that trip.I have only fooled with the RX100 a little bit yet, so these are initial impressions.  First, it's small, a size that reminds me of a deck of cards or a pack of cigarettes, so yes, it does fit in a shirt pocket (if a little heavy and expensive to actually carry there).  It weighs a good deal less than either the bare body or the lens of my DSLR.That small size does have a downside compared to a conventional DSLR - ergonomics.  You've got both hands hanging onto a slick metal body smaller than either hand.  It has very small fonts and icons, even the icons printed on the case are just a few mm high and hard to really see as they are small and not illuminated.  The physical controls are relatively few, and tend to have many functions.  The main control you use is a wheel that's also a 4-way rocker switch (both vertical and horizontal) and is less than 1/2 inch in diameter - it's so small that I make a lot of errors manipulating it, getting one motion when I intended another.  Of course the ergonomics issues are an inherent compromise with the small form factor, especially because they tried to retain a lot of controls and options.  There are a lot of menus to step through.I've taken a dozen or so shots, and have played with the high dynamic range options in difficult lighting.  The mode that really works well takes 3 images in 1/3 second and combines them to achieve a well controlled result in both highs and lows.  Picture quality has been very good - sharp, with pretty nice colors, and low noise.I am hoping that the ergonomic issues will be mitigated with memorizing the controls and menus as I become more familiar with this camera.  I do like the carry-everywhere size and picture quality.

However, the on board hints are good, and you can do well with it without knowing all that much about how the camera works. A while ago, I decided that it was time for me to really learn all about my camera, so I bought a book, http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Sonys-Cyber-Shot-RX-100/dp/1300294760/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1370145847&sr;=1-1&keywords;=Gary+L+Friedman. I got samples of ehis and another book from the Apple iBook store and chose Friedman's book. I've been happy with it, and am learning more about my camera. I've found it helpful to have the book in ebook form, as I could dowload it to my iPhone and have it handy to refer to.As others have commented, the pop up flash is a bit flimsy seeming. I always shoot without flash, so it has not been an issue for me. One thing that has been annoying for me is the placement of the recod button, as I tend to hit the button by accident, and find myself recording when I don't want to.

There is plenty of small m43s that can fit a very small waist pouch.To start with some good things: RX100 will give you excellent video and pictures of landscape/buildings on a nice sunny day. It also has an excellent LCD.However, I have other, better, travel cameras. I needed this one for around the house(e.g. kids parties...) and that's where this camera ultimately fails: kids are running around, in and out of shade, sometimes facing the sun on the beach so fill in flash is the must. RX100 has the recycle speed of no less than 5 sec which is on par with... well, nothing is that bad. More importantly, I was hoping that the recycle speed will be faster if the flash compensation is at minimum. And yes, it is faster  - in continuous shooting mode it's around 2sec. But if you keep the flash at minimum, and don't shoot in continuous mode (with your finger on the button all the time) , it's still 5sec. An obvious bug in SW that kills this camera.The second bad thing is the mediocre lens. There is a few reviews available elsewhere telling you which focal lengths work well with different apertures. This helps getting good pictures on a nice sunny day where you can clearly see the power of this sensor. However, as soon as you are close to the zoom end, or your subject is in the shade, forget about it - the picture quality is so inconsistent that really nothing helps. In fact, I have never seen a good picture coming out of this camera (had two) on the zoom end.The are also many other small quirks - no iso limit, no shutter speed limit (two features every enthusiast camera has for ages...). Also, you must rotate the lens ring some 10 times to go through all the focus range. Ridiculous...This would be a 2 star camera for me especially because the manufacturer is an electronics company which only cares about good marketing, not making some good photo equipment (at least in this range, including nex cameras where they offer the worst collapsible zoom kit lens, probably worth 20$, which they then sell with something powerful like nex6). Sony simply knows that the average Joe will fall for the small size and an excellent sensor so the lens can be a pure crap.However, I give this camera 3 stars since Panasonic, Olympus and especially Fuji  don't offer anything pocketable. Fuji XQ1 is something I waited for for months just to realize they failed in their attempt to copy Sony - mediocre lens and poor battery life just because they wanted to fit it into a very small body.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, but with little nit's . .", "Author": "John D.

The flaws are quite major, so I had to return it. Here below are the flaws:1. Lens is not as fast. Sure, it goes down to F1.8 but as you zoom you loose lot of aperture and light. At about half way zoom you are already at f3.5 or higher. So, if you think you will take wonderful pictures in low light with decent focal length, you should think again and look elsewhere.2. Built in flash is terrible at getting the right exposure. Tried all different settings with no avail. I couldn't take a decent shot in regular light indoors with flash. Everybody is bragging about how great the flash is because it could be bounced but the fact is it has extremely low power and the exposure is not right even when you shoot directly on to the subject let alone bounce off the ceiling.3. Macro focus is super flaky. It never focuses right. You have to try over and over until you find a sweet spot by then either you lost your subject or you lost your interest in taking the shot.5. Picture quality is not as great as I had thought. Even at ISO 100 it's not crystal clear. You also loose lot of details as soon as you up the ISO. I know that it is normal of any camera but I compared several camera in the similar group with much smaller sensors with better performance.Overall, it is very disappointing and I had no choice but to return it. Since then I got a Fujifilm X10 and now a X20. I kept them both. If you really want an advanced high quality camera very closed to DSLR level functionality and quality then get the new X20. Just so people don't start suspecting that if I am some how connected with Fujifilm then let me clear the air by saying no, I am not in any shape or form. I am not even a Fuji fan-boy. I am just an avid part-time photographer with a full time passion for photography. I like to shoot with great camera gears. My favorite cameras that I own and use regularly includes Canon 5D Mark III, Olympus OMD-EM5, Canon 20D, Nikon D600, Fuji X10 and X20.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Pics, Unacceptable Video", "Author": "R.

It's truly like a DSLR in a point and shoot body.  However, what makes it fall short is the lens.  3.6x zoom is just not quite enough range (5x would fit much better in the point and shoot department).  Sure, with a 20MP large sensor, digital zoom is much better.  But still, just about every medium-priced point and shoot is over 5x.  Also, while the wide-angle f/stop is very nice, at the telephoto end it's really bad.  Panasonic is making a 24x zoom that's f/2.8 for the entire range.  While that wouldn't be realistic with the sensor size in this camera, I'd think a 5x with f/2.8 over the entire zoom range would make this a killer camera.  As it stands now, it's very close to the best point and shoot camera on the market.  But, zoom range and lens speed is just not quite up to the task.  Make the lens 5x and f/2.8 over the entire zoom range and it really will be a DSLR in a point and shoot body.  As it stands, it doesn't really fit as a point and shoot nor a DSLR.

Compared to the DSLR, I'm probably not knowledgeable enough to tell all of the differences in the end result, but I don't notice anything where I think geez I wish I'd taken that one with the xti.  I do want to note two problems I've had that I don't see getting mentioned much: powering it down can take 30-60 seconds for the lens to retract, which is just sort of odd since it happens about half the time but the other times it shuts down and closes in say 3 seconds.  Also perhaps 1/5 of the time there is a long delay between pressing the shutter button and it actually taking the picture, maybe 30 seconds.  This in multiple situations, but for ex. Outdoors bright light, no zoom and just a scenery shot.  And no, obviously I don't have any delay set.

I want to concentrate on the things I dislike.I don't like not having a view finder.  Wearing polarized sunglasses often makes it difficult to see the screen, including the zillion camera options presented on the screen.I really liked my Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD because it satisfied my photography needs about 90+% of the time, but lost it last year.  I purchased the Sony mainly because of the advanced shutter, aperture and focus controls thinking it would satisfy my needs 99% of the time.  And it probably would, if I wasn't so \"carefree and careless\" in the point-n-shoot mode.During some group photos at our Thanksgiving celebrations, the camera didn't always detect every face.  Result: Some of the closer persons were out of focus.  Yes, this was my fault, but I expected it would use a more generic point-n-shoot everything-in-focus mode.  Now I use a little more time getting the correct depth of field and focus, but it's a \"bit\" frustrating.While doing some nighttime shooting at the Denver Zoo-Lights, I got some great shots - shots that would have probably required a tripod for other compact point-n-shoot cameras.  The only complaint I had was the occasional shot with persons, persons that the camera could not detect because of the darkness.  Result: The surprisingly powerful flash, coupled with exposure compensations, gave me grossly overexposed and unrecoverable faces.  I'm not sure how one would compensate for that.The most disappointing experience was at the National Western Stock Show. Somehow the camera got on one of its functions that I think should be reserved for photo software.  I will try to upload one of the pictures of my wife and grandson.  Result: No usable pictures.  Hey, if you're going to include bizarre functions, the camera still should keep and unaltered version.I admit these are operator error - my fault.  And, I hate to admit, I'm probably a better than average photographer *BUT* when I want to be lazy and use the camera as a point-n-shoot, I don't want surprises.  I miss my Canon PowerShot S95.  It was smaller, had a viewfinder, and I made less mistakes.For those who think this camera is a bit too big, I use Sony Jacket Case for Cyber-shot RX100 *BUT* instead of using the strap, I use a clip similar to this *Silver Tone Metal Trigger Lobster Clasp Key Chain Keyring 2 Pcs and clip the camera to my belt.

I don't know how I can keep them from being broken in 1-2 years!!- It's annoying to me that videos & photos are from separate replay menu.- Its zoom is a little less than the Canon G12- Every time I started to video my toddler after taking some photos, the screen says that it's recording my photos to the camera, so the videoing has to be delayed & I lost some seconds that I wanted to video my toddler! Even I don't know anything about cameras, it is slower than the Canon G12 at this point.- I feel the Canon G12 can take moving photos of my toddlers better than Sony RX100 (I noticed this when taking her photos playing with the balloons & bubbles outside)- I don't like using iMovies & Iphotos to download videos & photos from the camera to my laptops. I feel strongly that it took more time than when I downloaded photos & videos from Canon G12. & it's much easier to edit photos/videos by using Canon software.The software \"WirelessAutoImport\" suggested by Sony website for Mac can't be installed to my MacBook nor MacAir even mine meet the requirements of the software. I have no idea why. I posted this question in the forum but no answer yet.- I think with this price, Sony should provide a DVD to customers.- I don't like the way the camera is charged now & don't like the spend more money on the charger that will be in the market this Sept.- Battery of this camera is exhausted much faster than the Canon G12's.- The leather-like case for this camera is really expensive compared to genuine leather case for the expensive Fuji camera. But I bought it because it makes this camera easier to be carried around & it protects the camera much better than others.Pros:- Sony RX100 is very small compared to Canon G12 so I can easily carry it everywhere while chasing my toddler & take her photos or put it in my purse without hurting my skinny shoulder bone! :)- Its videos & photos are VERY nice! I'm very pleased (I only use auto mode as said).These 2 pros made me decide to keep the camera & give it 4 stars because all I care about is the beautiful photos & videos of my daughter :)I hope this review is rather helpful for people who only know use auto mode like me. I would appreciate if people who know more about cameras can teach me to benefit more from this camera! Big thanks in advance for your time!!UPDATE:- Just read advices of commenters. I appreciate your help & time. Will take time to learn more how to better use this camera.

The engineers did a great job. In my use testing for a couple of days, the results were excellent, not much different in some outdoor situations from a top full frame rangefinder camera. Compared to a Leica D-Lux-5 or Canon S95 (which I own), the images are better, although both of those cameras do a very good job.But I surmise that the accountants pulled all costs out of this by leaving out a real user manual, neck strap, discs and battery charger. There was a newspaper-like printed manual, but just the very basics. No software; you need to download that, and it's very confusing to use. For a $650 camera why not package it with a leather or cloth case?Overall it took excellent images, but I felt like Sony nickeled and dimed me. There's so many features that are not covered in the manual that makes it frustrating to use. I eventually returned it because, while it takes better images, it's not that much better to require me to lay out $700, and devote a few days to understand all of its features.On the positive size, the Sony has accomplished what no other camera company has been able to do, creating a camera that's better than any other pocket-sized camera.For those that say you can print out their on line extensive manual, that's not so easy; it's a tutorial, not a PDF file and you need to print it out one page at a time.

I was in a hurry with a vacation coming up and saw all of the rave reviews, making claims such as how the camera took better photos than their Nikon D7000.  I decided to buy it.My first comment is that I took it on a trip and kept it in my jeans pocket just like I have always done with pocket cameras.  In the past pocket cameras have spent countless hours in my jeans pocket with no adverse consequence.  Within 4 days with the RX100 I looked at the viewing screen on the camera and there was a scratch across the screen.My next complaint is the video.  I have for comparison a much less expensive Nikon pocket camera that I bought about 3 years ago.  From experience taking videos I know that you have to pan slowly if you want the audience to comfortably view a video.  I found that with the RX100 if you panned, even at a slow pace, horizontal streaks would appear in the recorded video upon playback, which greatly detracted from the video.I also noticed that the camera was slow processing shots and would take much longer than my older Nikon pocket camera, causing me to miss shots.As far as the size of the camera, I think Sony overdid it making it too small.  It felt uncomfortably small in my hands, and I just didn't like the feel of the camera.The camera has a feature which somehow transforms a shot that you intended to be in landscape mode into a portrait shot of one person in the photo.  It would then produce for the final photo not the shot that you intended but instead a portrait shot of the one person.  I even put it on Landscape mode to force the camera to take landscape photos and it still extracted portrait shots of the person in the photo, leaving out the rest of the shot.Another thing was that it was promoted how the screen had some special qualities which made it easy to view what you are photographing when out in sunlight.  That proved not to be the case.  I found it nearly impossible to see anything on the screen when I was outside in bright sunlight.Lastly, regarding the quality of the photos, it does not even approach the quality of a Nikon D7000, which I happen to own.  From what I could see it was no better than the aforementioned Nikon pocket camera that cost half as much years ago.I tried to return the camera and first, since it was fulfilled through Amazon but used a third party seller, I was informed that there was a 15% restocking fee and that is payable even if the camera and all paperwork and packing materials are in perfect condition.  Since my screen had a scratch I was told that there would be a 30% restocking fee.  Then another person in customer service told me that it was damaged, all the way through to the LCD, and that they couldn't take it back.I looked this up and found that the seller was exaggerating the situation in that the actual LCD screen is protected by a plastic cover that can be replaced if you buy a new back for the camera.Also, some brief searching online revealed that the plastic cover for the screen for the RX100 is extremely easy to scratch, and that you should buy a protective film at the same time you buy the camera.At any rate, I ended up giving the camera to my daughter because I couldn't return it.It would be an understatement to say that I was very disappointed with this camera.  To sum up, I received poor value for my money.  Sony should cease production of this camera because it will hurt their reputation.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too Thick", "Author": "B.

You have to have very big pockets...I've been using a Sony DSC-TX66 for the past 6 months as my daily camera and generally love it, but when I saw the enthusiastic NY Times review for this DSC-RX100, I got very excited and ordered one.The RX100 is a great camera. It is fast and takes great pictures and has every manual setting that a serious photographer could want.But compared to my DSC-TX66, it is huge. My TX66 comfortably fits into my front pants pocket with my wallet. The RX100 does not comfortably fit into any pocket I have, even by itself. This is a big drawback for me.If the photos from the RX100 really were *amazingly* better then any other smallish camera, I might find a way to live with the extra size but I shot both cameras side by side for several days and I really don't think there was a clear winner on image quality. I know that the RX100 has an amazingly huge sensor, but in real life it does not seem to make a noticeable difference in final image quality- at least not for the photos I take. I even took a lot of low light and fast motions shots, but the fact is that the smaller TX66 is also a great low-light performer.One plus is that this RX100 does finally have a standard micro USB port which is nice. The TX66 (like every other Sony I've ever had) uses a proprietary cable, which is just one more cable to have/lug around.Overall, I am sticking to my TX66. If you are looking for lots of manual settings and focus, and don't mind carrying your camera around your neck or in a bag, then maybe the RX100 is for you. If you just want to take great pictures, and want to always have your camera in your pocket then I'd recommend you look at the older and smaller TX66 instead.Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX66 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.3-inch OLED (White) (2012 Model)", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Very Well Made", "Author": "D.

Many of us don't want to be tied to a laptop or desktop, or have a really good tablet, and/or pay for data usage with a good download speed in the many situations where we want to look at a manual.More importantly... I still have not had time to explore the many potential and sophisticated complications available when taking a picture with this camera.

I know what folders are almost universally considered to be, and these are presented as though they are folders, although these folders do not appear if I take the SD card out of the camera and plug it directly into my PC.And it is easy to copy one or more of these folders to my PC using Windows Explorer. But it is not possible to delete a folder on the SD card/camera while examining it via Windows Explorer.I spent a half hour carefully searching a pdf of the entire lengthy manual trying to find a way to select a folder and then delete the entire folder in one swoop. I thought I had done just that with a selected folder when I clicked OK to delete \"All in Folder\". Instead the camera deleted all the pictures on the entire card. Fortunately I had previously copied most pictures of interest to my PC (I think).The almost complete absence of thought and work put into these important aspects of using a digital camera, beyond the initial action of taking the picture, translates into a mediocre product rating.And to add insult to injury, the folders themselves are still there - there is just nothing in any of them.

Sorry folks, but it's all hype and clever marketing.I can't tell much difference between pictures taken by rx100 vs my s8100.  The main difference I notice is much bigger jpeg files about 4-5 MB in size vs 2 MB.  Unless I care to zoom and crop the image, or blow it up to poster size, I don't see any point in buying and keeping the rx100, and don't see the benefit of having 20mb pixel.  The colors on the rx100 are too cool, and I prefer warmer colors like those produced by canon.  The lens are fast, but only if you don't zoom and don't use flash.  Shot to shot with flash on was a pity, almost 2 to 4 seconds lag in between depending on the charge level of the battery and amount of zoom.  SLRs are a different animal because you can get great shots without flash, but not your average point and shoot.  The battery drained much faster than I expected. Grip is not so good because the body is too smooth.  What's worse?  The rx100 struggled to focus on some of the macros I tried especially with full zoom.  The 3.6x zoom is simply not sufficient; 7x to 10x zoom is needed for taking pics of anything out of your reach such as a water lilly in a pond, or a singer far away on stage in a concert.For a 650usd camera, I can't justify keeping it unless I'm overwhelmingly impressed and pleased by all the features.

I probably expected way too much from a point and shoot. I remember having at one point a Panasonic LX5.

You need a camera bag (sold separately) in order to properly carry it around without damaging it.So, what we really have here is an eight-hundred dollar camera.Two flimsy-looking but apparently effective little \"straps\" are included. These are supposed to be inserted in the two teeny-weenie little slots on either side of the camera. But the straps are too big to be easily (or any other way) slipped through the slots.  I am utterly at a loss here. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get these things into the slots provided.  Even if I DO get these things attached, I need to by a \"strap\" (sold separately) that attaches to them.  Marvelous marketing strategy except that in my case I'm not a happy customer.I'm wondering what else will not work quite as I expected, without the purchase of some other \"extra\". I'm predicting that before I;m done, this will be a thousand-dollar camera. At that point I'll be afraid to take it out of the house.I think I'd better buy the warranty and the accidental damage insurance...", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Raw image is a problem", "Author": "ROY C.

I bought this camera from amazon with a \"Used- Like New\" description (because I know how many times cameras are opened as gifts and are returned un-used and often un-touched). Once receiving the camera, it looked great. Flawless even. I was thrilled to charge the battery and start shooting. Unfortunately, as soon as I turned the camera on the \"memory card\" was unable to be read and prompted me to re-insert it. I did this several times and have tried EVERYTHING to re-inserting, giving it time, trying to format it on my computer, trying to reformat it in the camera, using other camera's working memory cards, etc and still it tells me that \"Memory Card cannot be read - please insert memory card.\" I am uterally disappointed as it seems that this is a flaw in a handful of these cameras. For such an awesome camera and review, I cannot believe a detail like was unnoticed. Even more so, that amazon or a seller would try to re-sell a defective camera. Now off to returning and looking for another travel camera. Not happy.  ps - the memory card I am using is a SD32 which is compatable for a sony rx100.

What a surprise to find it made of cheap black plastic.  The almost-impossible-to-open flimsy teensy door which will be frequently used to charge the camera (and to upload photos to my computer) doesn't look like it will last more than a week.  Followed the instructions in the manual on setting the date, but it wouldn't set it.  Took some photos around the house and uploaded them to my I-Mac.  Unfortunately, when I turned off the camera, an error message came up on the I-Photo screen saying I had to go to Finder and eject the disc and that Mac would \"try to repair\" the damage to the disc the next time!!  Never had to do that with my old Canon camera.  When I turned that one off, that was all I had to do using I-Photo on either of my I-Macs.  Then I looked at the photos, and they were okay, but nothing to write home about.  Worse yet, when one photo required a flash, the flash cube popped up okay and that was fine, but when I turned off the camera, the flash cube stayed up and I had to push it back in!  The camera actually looks like a cheap throw-away camera.  I'm still plowing through the owner's manual and will probably get to like it, but what a disappointment for all that money!!February 2013:  Now that I've used it for quite a while, I feel it's a great camera with FAR FAR FAR more options than I'll ever use.  I took photos of a bike race and even though the rider was at least 50 feet away, when I viewed the photo on my computer, I was able to see his face very clearly.
