{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The DVD recorder you want for DIY", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R2JLMTTZB5DQKW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found it very confusing when I was looking for a DVR for my 4 camera setup.  It appears that there are quite a few brands and they are all very similar.  However, there are a couple of very important things you want.  And this unit has them.Full D1 recording at 30fps on all four channels at the same time.  This is very important.  Many DVDs will show live video at full 30fps at full 720p resolution, but when they record, they knock it does to 320 resolution, which is so tiny, you can't make much out in the video.  This DVR has the processing power to show and record full 720p video at 30fps on all four channels.Support for iPhone and Android video monitoring.  This is very cool.  I can check my cameras by loading up the app and can watch all 4 cameras to see what's going on.  Did my Ups package arrive?  Who's ringing my doorbell?  I heard a noise, is someone at my back door?  You can also play back the video and search for the motion activated events on any of the cameras.  Very easy to use interface.It has all the normal bells and whistles too.  Motion activated camera settings with areas to block from motion detection.  Email alerts with pictures on motion events ore alarm events.I was very glad I had this when a kid who was running from the police threw a handgun in my backyard, and then two weeks later left a note on my door demanding his gun back.  I was able to call police and show them video and pics of the kids with great shots of their faces and the car they were driving.  They didn't come back after they saw my cameras.  And I have peace of mind that I can watch my property from anywhere in the world.Dont be confused by other DVDs and their misleading claims on specs.  This is the DVR you want.  Drop a Hard drive in and your set.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Extremely Disappointing Company", "Author": "J. Ward", "ReviewID": "R1T5HZHJ4QMA90", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these DVR's in 2012.  It stopped working and a local tech guy diagnosed a failed motherboard.  The DVR is not in the US so I tried to buy another motherboard from Q-See.  They wouldn't sell one, they only repair items when returned to them.  I explained that it was not possible to ship it back and forth to this particular country, but they had no solution.  I had to buy another DVR.The new one is still working, but I bought a new cell phone with Android 4.4 and the Q-See app will not work with 4.4.  This is what they said:\"We may eventually support it, but probably not on all phones.  The version was recently released and we do not yet know the full extend of the changes that were made in the operating system.  The factory is currently working with the new version to see what changes we can make to our program to be able to work with it.  Once we have a new version it will be posted on the google app store. The new version probably will not work with all android phones.  Android phones are made by a variety of companies with a variety of features and resolutions and the new app will not likely work with all of them\".What a lame answer.  The system is useless to me via remote which is the most important function.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far, so good", "Author": "sculin", "ReviewID": "R21FU04CULQM2M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Once you work your way through the operating instructions, which I printed out, the unit performed as advertised.

The new D1 spec is so much better quality than the lower resolution of the older DVR's. My favorite features are being able to view the cameras basically anywhere you can get a internet connection, and the search features for reviewing the recorded video with up 16X playback speeds is great! If you are not tech savy it will be a chore getting your surveillance system setup. You have to run cabling to cameras (unless you purchase wireless cameras), and if you want it accessible over the internet it will have to be connected to your internet router, and you have to install a hard drive in the DVR, etc. but Q-See has alot of documentation on how to setup the DVR up including a giant fold out poster size guide and of course a full manual on CD.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect as advertised", "Author": "AnahoPrd \"Saigon Orchids & Flora\"", "ReviewID": "R13BM36OI5OGMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to install, networking a little bit tricky with ATT router 2Wire but anyway manage to reach all the cameras from the internet through Blackberry, iPhone 4, iPad and laptop.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "sent me wrong cable for hard drive that i bought together and wouldnt mail me out the right cable", "Author": "NEIL LOMBARDO", "ReviewID": "R3PPWWJBYBYN04", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "product is good but amazon sent me the wrong cable for the hard drive and would not give me the right cable so i canceled the order i have no time to play games when they say on the website that the hard drive was good for this dvr but the cable was the wrong one no thanks", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "WARNING!
