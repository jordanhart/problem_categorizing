Mach \"Caring Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R1SKHLTW7IEKPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a really hard time picking a kit out I wanted to buy.  I knew that I wanted this camera but had talked to several other people who said if your going to buy the camera spend a little bit more and buy a kit.  Boy am I glad I listed to them!I chose this kit because it had everything in it I wanted except a backpack camera case (the case it comes with is no way large enough to hold everything) and I just bought the backpack separate on amazon for $30.  However, I wanted a small case too for quick outings that I would just grab the camera alone for.  Everything in this kit is great! The camera takes awesome pictures, the zoom lens is perfect for sports or taking action shots from far away.  The UV lens is a must for protecting your regular lens along with the screen protector.  Great sd card and flash works fine (the flash is a little on the low end quality but still does the job).  I already had a tripod which is why I looked for a kit with a flash instead of the tripod which is why I ultimately went with this kit.  Overall, awesome and glad I chose this one.  Do yourself a favor and buy the kit because it is way cheaper then buying everything separately and chances are you will never go back and buy the stuff later.  Awesome buy!!", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera, cheap accessories.", "Author": "Olin", "ReviewID": "RCQVZPDTTMKMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since I am rating the kit as well as the camera I will take one star off, for the cheap accessories.The camera and two Canon lenses are great and exactly what you would expect. No complaints there at all. My wife and I have wanted to upgrade our point and shoot camera for a while and after talking with multiple people who do a lot of family and amateur photography I was told this was the camera to get and not to be too concerned with the accessories.The bag that comes with it is too small for everything that comes in the kit. You better plan on leaving everything at home or buying a bigger bag. The flash is pretty cheap but after reading reviews I was expecting that. The same goes with the cleaning kit, it looks like it was from the dollar store.Don't get me wrong, you get your monies worth just in the camera and lenses alone. The rest is just fluff and cheap starter gear that you can slowly upgrade a piece at a time.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "This Perfect!!", "Author": "Yamil", "ReviewID": "RVO80OYGXD8E6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is just perfect for all lenses and accessories.

Grafing \"ovopescavegan\"", "ReviewID": "R3LAUHZKQNWGSF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only bought this package because it was the cheapest way to get the camera plus kit lens and 75-300 lens (I figured anything else in the kit that was useable would be a bonus). I'll probably use the remote, uv filters, spare battery, and the sd card. The rest is useless for me. You will not get professional looking results with the cheater lenses, that's why the real deal lenses cost over $400 a piece...because they do what they do well. If I use a mounted flash it will be from canon, not the no-name no-specifications flash in this kit. The cleaning kit was kind of a joke, I would not touch this stuff to my lenses.
