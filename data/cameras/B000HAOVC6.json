{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing camera value!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R1I4ZD9KRFVL0T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of those nice cameras that's so well done, it's easier to talk about what the camera ISN'T, rather than what it IS!  This camera is not a small, shirt pocket camera, and might be a bit bigger than a woman would wish to carry in a purse.  It's not a super-tele camera, but it does have a respectable, bit longer than average 4x optical zoom.Using the camera, it has a good weight and feel for average sized hands.  The use of AA batteries helps keep the cost down, and has it's own advantages, although some may prefer the longer life charges of Lithium-Ion batteries (I do).  General, controls are well thought out and easy to use.  The zoom is nice and smooth.For those that prefer an optical viewfinder, Canon is probably the strongest supporter, and this is a better than average viewfinder, although it does not have a diopter adjustment.  But you'll probably never use it with the tremendous 2.5\" rotary screen.  Yes, there are 3\" screens on the market, but this dwarfs anything on a hinge!  It is a great aid in composing photos at low, high, or other odd angles (photos you simply didn't take before).Another feature that gets high praise is the flex-focus system.  Today's AF cameras do a decent job, but occassionally, they just don't hit on the right focus point.  With the flex system, you can determine which point to use.  This is simply great for crowded rooms or nature photos where the subject may not be the closest item within the focusing areas.Control for this price point is very good indeed.  Multiple \"scene\" modes make it easy for the novice (ok, or sometimes lazy pro), while the semi-auto and manual modes give even experienced users all they need.Simply put, this camera could have easily been priced $50 to $100 more.  The only real competition is the A640, $100 more, 10 meg, and a bit more attractive black finish.", "Date": "September 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Unexpectedly Good Pictures", "Author": "Frederick W. McManus \"Rip\"", "ReviewID": "R2QRMDUNCJFA8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first impression of the A630 was less than stellar. After a year plus squinting through the viewfinder of my Rebel XT, I was really looking forward to composing my shots in a big, beautiful LCD again. Unfortunately, the LCD on the A630 may be big, but it's not beautiful. It does a fine job helping you review what's already been captured and presenting menu options legibly, but a mediocre job of rendering what's coming through the lens. The color is inaccurate and interference frequently appeared on the screen when half-clicking to freeze the focus. It still beats a viewfinder for composing an image but, frankly, I'd rather have the smaller LCD on my daughter's A620.Ultimately, though, picture quality is everything to me, and here the A630 excels. I took 60+ pictures on a recent trip to Door County, WI and not one of them was a clunker, including several taken in very tricky lighting situations. Shooting modes worked as advertised although, with good lighting, the auto mode produced identical results. Indoors, flash pictures were perfectly exposed and the flash had a surprisingly good range.On average, and I know this is heresy, the A630 took better pictures than my Rebel XT, and I didn't feel the need to Photoshop a single one of them. If I cared more about the LCD, I would have given this camera a lower rating, but a lower rating would not have done justice to the quality of the images this camera produces.", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent optics, macro range,good manual controls", "Author": "MaxVideo \"maxvideo\"", "ReviewID": "RYOMSN943LHWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying I come from the \"old school\" of photography.  I've use good-quality film SLR cameras for years, and have always hated digitals because of all the cumbersome controls and lack of good manual control of the camera (yes, even on digital SLRs).This camera is quite an improvement.  If you are just a point-and-shooter, you can take it out of the box, throw batteries and an SD card in it and just click away.  But if you know what you are doing with a camera, there are good manual controls in here for you, too, and that's what I want to focus on.If you need to take close-up shots of small models, insects, flowers, etc this is the camera for you.  If you want something tiny and slim just for snapping pics on vacation, this is NOT the camera for you.  It will do a superb job, but it's more than you need and therefore bulkier than you probably want.It has shutter and aperture priority - the latter being the most important.  You can manually stop down the lens anywhere from 2.6 to 8.0.  It wish it would stop all the way down to, like f/22, but that's a lot to ask for a $200 digicam.  In macro mode, it really truly can focus on things only 1 cm away from the lens, and the focus is still crisp - very impressive.Put this thing on a tripod, put a good light on your subject, turn the flash OFF, use the built-in timer to avoid shaking the camera, and you'll get magazine-publishable photos, and that's no lie.White balance is superb.  You can take shots under flourescent, incandescent, tungsten (photofloods) and the color rendition is terrific, even if you use the \"auto\" white balance.  But you can manually calibrate it if you really want to.  There are also several preset white balance settings (flourescent, incandescent, tungsten, and about 4 others).It runs on 4 AA batteries, so you can shoot a long time before the batteries are dead, but definitely invest in 4 NiMH AA's and a charger.It uses standard SD cards, not like those morons at Sony who insist on using a proprietary memory card in their cameras.The best thing about it is that all the real controls you need if you are used to using a real camera are easily accessible right at the top level buttons - exposure compenstation, macro mode, flash on/off, f/stop.There is also a full manual mode, so you can set f/stop, exposure, shutter speed and focus all completely manually.  I fooled with some of the DSLRs, and those \"mid-range\" hybrid models like the S3 (sort of in between the things like this A630 and a DSLR).  Frankly, they are agony to use.  If I spend $800-$1000 on a DSLR, I do not expect it to punish me to find how to change the *(", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "FlamingJune1967", "ReviewID": "R4KS7ZF0IH8NW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I currently own a Canon A80 (which I love) and was interested in upgrading to the highly reviewed A630.  I received the camera in time for Thanksgiving and took about 200 photos with it in a variety of conditions.  Everything was great until I got home and downloaded my photos to the computer.  About half of them were blurry... but worse, ALL of my indoor shots had a lot of noise.  I took some more test shots, and noticed that the \"camera movement\" icon came on every time I used the zoom on indoor shots or any time I tried to take an indoor shot without the flash.  After calling customer service, I was convinced that I just had a defective camera, so I contacted Amazon and they were wonderful about sending another camera right out.Today I received the second camera.  It was no different from the first.  I am a point and shoot photographer who is mostly interested in taking photos of my children... so I took a variety of photos using the same settings on both of my cameras (a80 and a630) then downloaded them to my computer for comparison.  I even printed out several photos to make sure the problems weren't with my monitor.  Outdoor photos were excellent on both, however there was a huge difference inside.  In a well lit room with plenty of natural light from outside, the a630 still produced significant noise, while my a80 on the same setting (auto) produced clear noise-free photos.  When my toddler was moving, I got mostly blurry photos with the a630 on auto as well as using the \"kids and pets\" mode, while my a80 produced crisp and clear photos.I love Canon cameras, and this was my 3rd PowerShot.  I really expected to love this camera as much as my previous Canons.  Now I don't know whether I should even try to find a newer camera, if the inside shots are going to be like this.Things I liked about the a630:LARGE LCDNice quality moviesScene assistsGreat outdoor shotsVery accurate colorsQuick shutter responseThings I didn't like about the a630:Poor quality inside shots with lots of noise and blurry results.If I were a pro, I could probably figure out how to use the manual controls to fix my indoor problems... but I'm just a mom who wants some cute photos of her kids, so this didn't work for me.

Like its preceders, it takes crisp and clear pictures full of vibrant colors.  I absolutely love the Color Accent feature, to turn all but one color black & white, which creates a professional effect of accenting one color.  The zoom is also fantastic - I used the 16x to photograph some trees in the distance, and it showed a squirrel on one of the branches that couldn't be seen with the naked eye, without losing any quality.  This was astounding - the Canon SD630 took blurry pictures with a 6x zoom (one of the reasons I returned it), so I was very impressed by this.One cool feature that Powershot preceders didn't have is the large swivel screen.  It's very helpful if you want to put the 10-second or 2-minute timer on and capture a picture of you and friends.  You can position the swivel screen so that you can see how you look (ex: too close, too far away, off-center) and get better photos.  I also liked the large size; it's high-resolution, too, so it doesn't appear grainy on the screen.  My friend Nathan has a 3\" screen as well, but his has low-resolution and everything always looks grainy/blurry.One final neat feature of the A630 is it being motion-sensitive.  When viewing pictures, you can turn the camera 90\u00ba and view vertical images vertically on the screen.  If you try to view vertical images horizontally, you don't get a very good idea of how it turned out.All in all, this camera takes GREAT pictures and has neat effects, but is simple enough for an amateur to use.", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "extreamly please with its performance", "Author": "NiceGuy", "ReviewID": "RN1Y75NHK9K19", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this camera.

I was well pleased with the quality of pictures that the Nikon made, so I knew it was going to be hard to replace.A lot of research later, I found the Canon A630. I like the large LCD screen and what was even better was the fact that it would fold shut, or rotate so that even I could get into a shot once in a while. Even better than that is the picture quality... I have a picture of a plane towing a glider, and when enlarged you can actually see the tow line.The reason I gave it four stars is this camera doesn't have the rechargable battery pack that I liked so well with the Nikon. Also, the memory card slot is in the same door as the four AA-batteries and I usually end up spilling my batteries when getting the card out.

However, it was so bulky, we often just left it at home, rather that take it with us to parties.  The same convenience of being able to use AA's (and not worrying about charging the camera, or having it die halfway through your trip) also results in a substantial bulk.  Also, the camera does not accomodate one-handed operation.  If portability is not a concern -- go for it.  It is infinitely tweakable -- with a full manual mode and lots of creative options.

Monroe", "ReviewID": "R1GD48QKTWCYHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first digicam I got (another brand) was very disappointing for my purposes, the A630 is a major improvement.  Autofocus works very well in low light.  The LCD continues to work in dim light also instead of going blank.  Battery life is very good using 2000MAH AA rechargeables.  The tilt/swivel LCD display is very handy when its not possible to get your head behind the camera, such as documenting wiring inside an equipment rack or taking shots from ground level. There is a programmable self-timer mode which I have found to  be useful.  I use the optical viewfinder  often in bright sunlight when the LCD is difficult to see, many other models don't have this.  The A630  is capable of very good resolution, I have used it for photographing some intricate mechanisms and circuit boards and the detail in the pictures has brought favorable comments.  The auto white balance works well in most situations including dimmed incandescent light. Aperture priority mode is great for documentation shots where you need to maximize depth of field, many similar cameras don't have this mode.  Outdoors the A630 reproduces blue sky and clouds beautifully without using any lens filters. I have not used the movie mode so cannot comment on that.The pictures are a bit noisy at ISO 400 and above if enlarged although still good \"snapshot\" quality. In very dim light (without flash) its necessary to use high ISO and accept a little noise or stabilize the camera and use a slow shutter.  The shiny camera case can be rather slippery to hold, I put a strip of cloth tape on it for a big improvement.  The computer software provided has limited editing features, I use an old copy of Paint Shop Pro if significant editing 1s needed.Bottom line:  I am very happy with this camera so far, I have been able to get a good picture in just about any situation.

IT comes with 4 Alkalines - but you can go thru those in no time. Get yourself a set of rechargable 2300-2500 Amph/hr and be done with it. Additional thickness is added to the case to accommodate the swivel LCD viewer.Memory is located in with the battery compartment - the tiny SD card is spring loaded in a slot. I chose a standard speed 1 gig card - and shoot max resolution every time. I dislike mixing batteries and memory access on the same latch - having visions of AA batteries rolling loose everywhere ... lol... The camera has a need for greater power than ever - larger LCD viewer, more powerful flash and better, faster computer...The large LCD viewfinder is twist/movable in many directions. It is bright but strong sun will wash it out. The optical viewfinder is a good backup for strong sun situations.The built in speedlight/flash on the A630 continues Cannon's tradition of redeye - even with redeye setting utilized. The flash is more powerful than ever - as is the computer in auto setting - fastest setting yet - with fewer 'hunting' delays in low light situations.Picture quality is simply outstanding - vibrant oversaturation of colors - zoom lens adequate out to 4X - continue to stay away from that digital zoom past 4X...Overall - the A630 is a grown-up version of my A85. I like the swivel LCD viewer, faster computer, and familiar controls. It enables me to utilize my investment in rechargable AA batteries - and the whopping 8MP of picture quality gives me pause to take my 'digital Rebel' dSLR on vacation.Disappointed I am with the SD card in the battery compartment and the discontinuance of CF memory in the PowerShot line.

While it is a great camera, it was too large to be convenient as it required a separate case and was not easy to throw into a purse or backpack.  Due to this size limitation, we rarely had the camera to capture candid moments and general activities.  We also wanted a camera that ran on standard batteries if necessary.  Our old camera ran on a rechargable lithium-ion, but when we went on vacation this summer my wife forgot to pack the charger.  We burned through the battery in the first 2 days and had to resort to disposable cameras for the remainder of our trip.  After reading a number of reviews and hearing a few people mention their happiness, it was clear we wanted a Canon.  Canon makes 2 different lines of \"point-n-shoot\" cameras, the SD line and A.  Both received high reviews and we could have gone either way.  I decided to purchase the A610 because it appeared to be a sweet spot for the number of megapixels (8), optical zoom (4x) and price.  We took it on vacation over the holidays and took a number of quality shots, ranging from close-up portraits to large scene landscapes.  I used the PhotoStitch feature to grab 5 shots of the desert landscape around Scottsdale, AZ and used the included software to tie it together into a great-looking wide angle shot.  I hope to get the photo printed professionally because it came out too large for my home photo printer.  I also liked how the LCD screen automatically rotates when shooting in landscape or portrait mode.  The controls were very intuitive and easy to use.  The standard SD card slot is a plus as my laptop also accepts SD, thereby allowing me to use my laptop as a transfer device and not require carrying multiple cards.  A 1GB disk is certainly big enough for 1 day of photos, and if it is full, I can easily empty it onto my laptop.

In size, the A630 is even larger than the A70, but that's not a drawback for me as it still fits conveniently in my pocket.  It uses four AAs, like the A70, and its hefty feel adds camera stability when longer shutter times are called for.  The 8 mega pixel images are a vast improvement over the A70's 3.2 mega pixels, with incredibly precise resolution possible, especially in well lighted images.  These images run between 5 and 6 megs each, but the 1 gigabyte data card I bought with it still holds over 200 of them (or many hundreds of smaller pictures), so that's not a problem either.  I like the option of complete manual operation, but also appreciate being able to take lots of fast snapshots on auto with some expectation of getting usable pictures.  The flash is stronger than the A70's, so I'm looking forward to using it underground on caving trips.  Redeye is still a problem, even with the redeye reduction pre-flash.  I'm getting better at PhotoShopping it out.  One thing I really like is the fact that this camera will do its thing the instant you press the shutter button, like an SLR, so if you're trying to put a speeding diesel locomotive right in the center of the frame, you don't have to lead your target or compensate for any time lag.

Berin", "ReviewID": "R24SR6Y712VSZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Canon A630 to back up my Canon Rebel XT dSLR - both are 8 Mpixel.  The A630 was intended for situations that didn't require the dSLR attributes - low light, lens interchangeability, bulkiness,and most importantly:  the rapid shot-to-shot capability.The Canon A630 is an excellent point-and-show.  The image quality is nearly identical to my Rebel XT (except for low light situations and flash recovery speed).I had to keep reminding myself this is NOT a Rebel XT (in size, speed, price, bulk, and low  light situations).  It is a $299 vs. $899 list camera for TOTALLY different purposes.The swiveling lens is great for off-angle shots (e.g. over head, around corner in tight situation like an aircraft carrier deck, etc.).  The 4X zoom is nice;  I like 12X, but 4X is perfect for most folks.The movie mode (640x480 at 30 fps) is very nice too - it still have some artifacts compared to a true video camera, but adequate quality for short clips.  I used it for New Year's fireworks in Oahu, Hawaii and the video is pretty good with some artifacts in the dark sky areas.  It beats having to carry two cameras.The menus are very handy - selecting BW or Sepia instantly changes the view finder to show exactly how it looks.Use of anything beyond ISO 80 is recommended only as last resort.  The image noise levels are noticeable and at 400 and beyond, I consider it very bad.  If you need the shot, use it, but don't expect good image quality.I also bought the DC8 underwater housing for snorkeling in Oahu's Hanauma Bay - it allows total control of the camera from power on to ALL features and modes.  The pictures I took were fantastic.  It would be nice to get an underwater housing for the Rebel XT, but at $900 vs. $199 for the DC8 housing, the A630/DC8 combination is an excellent value with great underwater capability.  The flash seemed to work very well underwater (unlike my Pentax Optio s4i - too much debris reflected back into the lens assembly with weird flares).  The A630/DC8 underwater performance was beyond my expectations.Make sure to switch to 'fish' mode to compensate for blueness of underwater.The 4xAA battery capability is compatible with my battery stash.  The SD cards need to be selected carefully.  An 8 Mpixel camera can comfortably use a 2GB SD card.  However, if you get a 4 or 8 GB card, you MUST get an SD HC-compliant card - the non-SD HC cards do NOT work.  I bought/returned a Pretec 4 GB SD card - it was not SD HC-compliant and simply did not work.  Canon's website says the A630/A640 are SD HC-compliant and the cards are available, but rather expensive.  I made do with 2x2GB cards, but that may be a limitation underwater (as you can't easily change cards on the beach without getting sand/water in the camera).

I took this camera to a Cincinnati Reds game and was impressed at the quality photos I was able to retrieve. I sat midway up in the stands and was able to capture some excellent batting pics of Griffey Jr. However, when the zoom is in full effect the camera must be held completely still in order to get clear photos. After some trial and error I was able to come back with some great pics! This camera gives very sharp, colorful pics almost everytime. It took some time to get used to the focus, which is made by holding the shutter button halfway down before taking the pic. I also used the video function at a recent party and was suprised to find that the audio came out better than expected. The video is a little grainy, but I bought it for the pictures, not the video.

I can't do anything impulsively. Finally I was deciding between the nikon s10 and canon a630. i was kind of worried about 4X zoom Vs 10X. After much anguish i picked the a630. it is awesome. the 4X zoom is fine with 8mp, i can use digital zoom(ie crop out part of the picture)and the quality is still incredible. It has all kinds of great extras, but i am just going to focus on the important stuff: quick response, a screen and viewfinder, manual mode, video, powerful flash, variable shutter speed. What's best though is the articulated LCD.At first I thought it was unnecessary that it could swivel and rotate 360 degrees but it is great. While the s10's screen can rotate only vertically in order to take high or low horizontally-oriented shots with ease, it cannot rotate horizontally to easily take vertically oriented shots like the a630. the screen is so great at concerts especially. i can hold it above my head (and the crowd) in the vertical or horizontal position and just point the screen towards me.Also, i like that it takes 4 AAs so i can just use regular batteries if my rechargables ever run out. i got the Eneloop batteries and so far they are awesome. i got the kingston ultimate 2gb card as well. These help my camera to operate quickly in continuous shooting (burst) mode. I can also adjust the size and resolution to shoot faster. the options available are abundant. i can turn off the sound and adjust anything i want.I have taken some sweet concert shots with slow shutter speed and also some beautiful shots of flowers in macro mode.the only things i dislike are: (1) i cant shoot with inverted colors; i would have to invert them after on my computer. (doesnt matter, just would be more fun) (2) There is no dedicated sports mode. I can easily go to manual or shutter speed mode to pick a fast speed, but i just wish it would do this stuff for me. i think this is so i can change other settings as well(ie. shoot in snow mode with fast shutter).I definitely am pleased with my choice.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera !

This is a tough digital with a bright display that you can pull out and flip around if you want.  The high-res video mode is 640x480 and smooth.  We bought them for use by law enforcement, fire and ambulance crews because the controls are large and easily manipulated by people under a bit of stress.  The USB2 cable connection is fast and the transfer software is acceptable, even if it's not terribly pretty.  The software stores your photos in dated folders, so make sure you've set up your camera properly.  One of our folks had a bunch of photos end up in a folder dated \"1980\" which appears to be the blank date setting.  I carry mine with an extra four AA batteries (yup, four) because you don't get much warning when they go.  But as a general rule, the camera's not a battery hog either.  The macro and exposure adjustment setting work pretty darn well.I've dumped this camera a number of times and keeps on ticking.

Below are the major Pros and Cons. As you will see, the pros are much more numerous than the cons, but the it really depends on what's important to you.PROS:-Great picture quality. Those 8 MP really pay off.-Wide range of options. Choose from differnt types of lighting available, sharpness of the pictures, ISO ranges, and app settings.-Ease of use. I personally monkey around with it before my pictures to get the best quality, but your waitress could grab it and take the picture without having to get a lecture on usage.-Fairly accurate rendition of the picture on the LCD screen-Big LCD screen-Adjustable screen. This seems strange to need it, but it comes in handy ALL THE TIME. I'm a young guy, so my friends and I are always taking pictures of ourselves when we're out, so the screen can turn towards the front of the camera to accomidate. Also, you can angle the screen so that you can take the pictures in strange positions and still get good view.-The digital zoom is 4x. This is huge. The most I've seem besides this was 3.5x. It also has a 16x optical zoom, which is nice, but shouldn't be confused with digital.CONS:-For some reason, there is no image stability on this model. Earlier and later models have them, but not this one. If you don't know how to play with the ISO settings, then this could be an issue.-Low-light pictures can be another issue. Again, there are ways to monkey areound with it, but if you don't want that extra work, that is an issue to consider.-Macro settings are nice, but on a camera of this caliber, it really should also have a super macroHope this was helpful!", "Date": "December 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "4AA Batteries make this a winner!", "Author": "Samo \"Samo\"", "ReviewID": "R3PRF6O3F0NRZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes wonderful detailed pictures at most every setting.  The swivel LCD can be very useful although it's left showing like a normal camera most the time.  The flash pics are well-balanced and look natural on most all exposures.  The real plus with this camera is the fact that it takes four AA batteries.  This means it has some more amperage to recycle faster - the delay one usually waits to take the next flash picture or regular picture is negligible.  Friends who have tried it say it's the most digital responsive camera they have used.  When I use 4 2700 mAH NiMH Sanyo batteries, I have yet to have to replace the batteries after a full day of shooting.  It's pretty hefty too, a little bigger than the normal pocket camera.  I like the heft, the mass, and so much that this purchase here was for my wife so we have two of these cameras.In short, if you are looking for a responsive fairly reasonably priced digital camera that takes great pics and has very little if any shutter lag between shots, then evaluate this.  I own Sonys, other Canons and a Nikon digital camera and this one has been the best one so far.

I had even packed a ton of batteries for my trip in anticipation of this. Instead, I was able to take 200-300 pictures on each set of batteries.The 8MP was also plenty and the shots we made into posters turned out great.Finally, the camera also takes great pictures in all modes. I especially feel like the night shots came out much better than my previous A70. The audio on movie mode was also much improved over older models.  The ONLY slight con is that framing a shot with the viewfinder sometimes produces mixed results. I think the actual picture taken tends to be a little bigger than what you see in the viewfinder....for example if you frame a shot to avoid a tourist in the viewfinder, that person may still make an appearance in your photo.

But even without knowing how to use all the bells and whistles, it still did a fine job.  The only adjustments I used were varying degrees of zoom, flash on or off, and closeup on or off -- and all these are easy to manage (and to remember).  The camera is compact and easy to hold.  Rechargeable batteries lasted through many, many shots -- I recharged every 2 or 3 days, and never had a problem. Eight megapixels give photos that can be \"taken apart\": pulling out an interesting face or object, and blowing it up as a separate picture.  Also, with this degree of resolution, it's hard to tell where optical zoom leaves off and digital zoom begins.Only two criticisms:  first, the lag time between pushing the shutter button and actually taking the picture (and I think all digitals are plagued by this). Second, it's easy to accidentally twist the dial on the camera top when pulling it out of a bag or case, and it's hard to remember to always check to see that it's set correctly.Overall, though, a very good camera for the price -- I'm well-satisfied.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!!", "Author": "Toshio Shigematsu \"T-Shigg\"", "ReviewID": "R1YD4ZYW6G6EFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera not to long ago and it is without a doubt the best camera i have bought!

It is very intuitive, takes great photos, and the battery life seems to be fantastic.  However, my first experience with the Canon software included left much to be desired.  First off, the software suite is huge - over 300Meg for the complete installation.  The software itself seems to be very well written and intuitive, but it has some severe limitations.  First off, you simply cannot access the memory card in the camera like a computer hard drive, something that every digital camera I've owned has let me do.  (Kodak, Nikon, Minolta, heck - even the no-name digital binoculars let me mount as a hard drive).  There doesn't seem to be any way to just mount the card as a drive.  So, stuck with using the software to extract photos from the camera, I came headlong into another severe limitation - the software does not recognize any hard drives on your PC that are network drives.  I have all my digital photos on a server, and I would be satisfied to simply use the software to transfer the photos, but not being able to see any network drives puts another step in the process - copying them to the local hard drive and then using windows file manager to copy to the network drive.  Canon support basically told me \"the software does not support network drives\" without offering any other suggestions.  I guess I'll have to fall back to buying a card reader (I have to get a new one that supports SDHD) and transferring photos that way.  I'm giving it four stars because the benefits of the camera being so good outweighs the software problems.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Photos, a little bulky", "Author": "Avory H.", "ReviewID": "R2FQBGU6LBDT4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my A630 about 4 months ago. Before I had a Kodak Easy Share 4.0 mpx, and I figured it was time for an upgrade, because I was going to study abroad in Germany for the semester and I naturally wanted really good photographs.It's a month before I come home and overall I have to say that I love the pictures this camera has produced. I'm not a photographer, but I am really picky about photo quality, and this camera doesn't disappoint. It has a setting for virtually everything you could want. Sometimes the setting for the situation wouldn't work as well as other settings (for taking a picture of a statue at night, I got the best picture with the indoor setting without flash instead of the night setting. Who would have guessed?) Also, sometimes my pictures would be blurry or have a lot of noise in the pictures with indoor settings. The blurry-ness could get annoying sometimes when I just wanted to take a great picture, but I would just apply the high ISO or change settings and it would be fine. While traveling, the biggest problem I've run into with this camera has been the size. I knew it was big when I bought it, and it was a sacrifice I was willing to take. But I think it's worth mentioning: This is no pocket camera.My favorite thing about this camera is all of the customization features for pictures before you take it. I also find it really easy to use these features, which is nice for click-and-go situations. My personal favorites are the color exclusion and foliage setting. They make outdoor pictures look really natural (even with people in them). Also, the rotating screen has come in handy, not just for self/group portraits (because it's awkward to ask a passerby in another language to take your picture) but for awkward shots too. Instead of bending over to get a good angle, I can just rotate the screen and see what kind of a shot I'm going to get. Along the same lines, I've gotten good videos out of my A630 as well. You can tell exactly what the talking moose is saying in a crowded market!I also found it useful to use rechargeable batteries because the camera does hold 4 of them (they last for quite a long time!) and it's just cheaper in the long run if you rely heavily on your camera day in and day out.Overall, through my experience, I would recommend this camera to anyone who travels and wants unforgettable pictures and is willing to settle for a bulky camera.

The first A630 had a problem when I recieved it, the flash wouldn't work and the Canon tech support was a big help, and they were suprised that it was defective (very rare) they told me. No problem with exchange from where I got it. Battery life is excellent with plain old alkaline, but get rechargeables. Video mode is very nice and I love hooking it up to my TV. Macro shooting is the best as well as night shooting. I've made some crazy light trail shots of moving cars at night. Can't wait to try it during the Fourth of July fireworks! The LCD screen is great and the view finder is nice too, actual it zoom in as well. Like I said it is the best camera for learning on, it will show you if you make an error before you shoot. It also has a quick startup, and you have alot of custom features on it. The software it comes with is easy to use. I'm a firefighter and I can't wait to try it on a call or training.

I bought it at a serious bargain: $180 or so from an online discount warehouse.Anyway, this camera is heavy and big. It won't fit in your pocket, and you have to be careful handing it to someone else, because if they don't get a good grip it'll fall out of their hand.I love this camera with a passion. It's:*Durable. I have an attic bedroom and sat it on my railing, then bumped it down my stairs. It fell 12 feet and bounced. It looked a little banged up, but works 100%. This was about 6 months ago. The shutter now refuses to shut all the way on occasion, and sometimes the videos will appear blurry. That's the only damage, and a stop and start of the recording will fix that.*High quality video and picture. I'm not a professional photographer, I'm a teenage girl. The appeal for me was that 8 mega pixels sounded really sharp, and i was right.*The effects are quite flexible, and i loved experimenting with the drastic and subtle changes allowed in the \"program\" function of the camera. My favorite is probably the portrait setting, although the color swap and color accent are really cool too.*It should be noted that this camera burns through batteries like c r a z y. I had it for a month and decided it would be best to buy some rechargeable batteries. So i bought 8 AA batteries and a charger from Radioshack. Now i always have another set charged and ready when i've burned through my current set. For this, I don't even consider the short battery life for the camera to be a con.*Reliable: this camera gives minimal technical difficulty. It's not 100% on picture taking response. You'll have to hold down the button for a few seconds, even without the flash being turned on. I haven't used a camera that didn't behave this way, and there are ways to increase the response speed, but i've never been impressed with it. It's also gotten slower this past year: a sad sign that it might be wearing down.*the video is SPECTACULAR. I've used camcorders with worse quality. I make instructional piano Youtube videos that require distinct details to be visible, and this camera never lets me down. On occasion, after the drop, i've had to stop and start a video that was too blurry, but the second time comes crystal clear, so this isn't a big deal to me. The camera gives you the option to choose how detailed your videos will be. Less detail=more memory space, as higher quality videos will require more space. But it's 2011, and we all knew that, right?I always get compliments about the videos i take with it. \"Oo, whose camera is this? It's so clear/colorful,\" things to that effect.Besides taping my piano videos, I used to use this camera to record myself and my friends at gymnastics meets. This is where the option to edit and freeze-frame on the go is a must. There might be an additional 30 seconds on a video, and a limited memory card means that 30 seconds has gotta go. So \"set\" button>edit>edit beginning>save, and now you have that much more flexibility in your recordings for the rest of the day. The camera on its default settings allowed me to watch routines frame by frame, and i could see exactly how a trick was executed. Every once in a while, an appendage would be blurry due to exceptionally high speed, but it captures tumbling passes and the vault exercise with ease and accuracy, which goes to show you how detailed the video features are. Again, this is with the default settings, not even the advanced detail.*Transfer to the computer is easy, but i'm not terribly knowledgeable about how advanced the features can be. I tend to dump everything, name my photos/videos, then format my memory card in the camera. I don't know what all it's capable of in this department. It's not always speedy, but that's because i am transferring large files. The speed is not unreasonable, but this is the only camera i've ever owned, so i can't compare transfer speeds in all fairness.*I don't print my pictures, but they email just fine, and the high mega pixel count and clarity on-screen shows good promise for beautiful prints.*This camera allows you to take successive photos, anywhere from 1 to 10 photos snapped automatically with a small delay in between. Great for goofing around. Dunno why else you'd want it, but i use it with my brother when we're bored. We do stop-motion skits ha ha!*My FAVORITE feature is the wonderful flippy screen! It's not fragile, it's durable just like the rest of this sturdy, chunky camera. The screen allows you to see you taking your own picture. I can place my face where i want in the frame, though it's backwards (move to your left, the camera portrays you going right.). This is especially handy in two ways:1) Taking pictures with multiple people without a freestanding photographer. Just like taking your own picture, it can be super tricky to include every face in your photo. But with the flipping screen, you can position it perfectly, no talent required.2) When using the successive auto-shoot feature, you can see what you're doing, even between frames.All in all, i love this camera like i love my dog. it's my baby, and though my friends mock me because i tend to have large electronics, this camera is fabulous, effective, powerful, insanely durable, has lasted forever, and if you catch it on sale, it's economical. Would I buy this over again at Amazon pricing? Yes, if i wasn't a broke college student. But it's really worth it. you'll need an SD cards for memory (i have one that's 1 GB and another was a gift: 4 GB!! 1 gig will work for you just fine), and at least 4 AA rechargeable batteries, then you're all set.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like this camera", "Author": "Polina", "ReviewID": "RQNSMB0MJVF6I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using it for 3 years and it still works.

But somewhere, the A630 just leaves me missing my A95 (the first camera met a salty demise in one of those camera \"baggies\" in the Gulf of Mexico looking for jewfish).First I'll tell you what I did find to be pros about the camera:-Flip and turn lcd - big and it FLIPS AND TURNS.  Very nice for macros and sneaky shots.-Quick shutter button reaction - you don't have to wait forever between pushing the shutter and actually taking the picture.  It's almost instantaneously in my experience.-You can use accessories with it - buy an off brand extension and you can put polarizing filters (i highly recommend this), a Cokin set with a ND graduated filter and your landscape or sunrise/set shots will suddenly get much greater.  Even without anything on the extension, it acts like a hood and keeps glare from marring a shot.-This is my camera of choice for macros and infrared shots (using a filter).  You can get millimeters away from things. It's amazing. It's like having a microscope with 100x magnifier.And my main camera (an EOS digital Canon camera) doesn't have the advantage of actually seeing through the infrared filter (which is a deep red/almost black), so it's difficult to frame shots.  The A630 lets you see through the filter on the LCD screen.Now, the not so hot;-You're limited in the use of your ISO.  Anything over 200 is unusable in my opinion (and 200 is not that hot either).  Any ISO under 100 is unusable without a tripod or hands of steel.-The size.  Not small enough to tuck in your pocket.  I really wish it were.  This is supposed to be my little camera.-Photo quality.  I know this camera should take better pictures than my A95 but I'm just not convinced it does.All in all, get it for a reallyreally good price and you should be happy.  :)", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice flip screen, but camera a little heavy & bulky.", "Author": "Elle77", "ReviewID": "R278ZUDJH2KGVF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Over all I like this camera.

I like to carry a camera absolutely everywhere I go. In the past I've always carried point and shoots but had decided I would prefer a camera that had the ability to go manual. Plus the rotating LCD was such a plus when it came to this department.When I first purchased the camera I was absolutely ecstatic. I'd heard such raved reviews about the A610 which had recently retired from retail shelves. I got it home and discovered that well, maybe I wasn't so hot a photographer after all. I avoided it for about 6 months before it made itself into the purse after all.I had the same problem everyone else seemed to have with taking photos indoors. It didn't compare to my 3.2MP HP Photosmart 735. I didn't expect the world but comparable indoor shots to an outdated point and shoot were kind of on my list of great expectations. I actually found out I can shoot video in a scene I can't take a photo in and the video look perfectly fine. It's a better camcorder than a camera sometimes, if it wasn't for the pesky memory limit. And the software freezes upon completion of upload every time.With the help of imaging software I have come to actually love this camera. I don't mind airbrushing or touching up the color and light settings later on...that's what I do for a living and what I love. It's a workable lighter camera for the professional but I would not advise it for the everyday consumer.Somewhere in the past month the camera has become severely damaged physically. It went on this crazy trip through the City Museum in Saint Louis (think giant metal playground) and I don't know exactly what happens but on my way home I realized that it was dented badly. I can only imagine what kind of a blow it took. It still works just the same however and functionally I never would have noticed. All of the pictures survived the ordeal.I am hoping to upgrade in the near future, being that mine now looks like a car wreck, and of course technology progresses. I will still probably look to Canon. This hasn't turned me completely off. Everything has to have it's downers and it's just unfortunate this one has such a huge curve to overcome.

It's pretty clunky for a point-and-shoot, but the zoom and manual mode make up for it. It's small enough to lug around, yet the grip and features make it feel like a \"real\" camera. The all-manual exposure mode was my main reason for buying Canon A-series cameras, even though I've ended up using them in Program mode 99% of the time -- it's a very smart P. mode. Neither this one nor the previous A70 have disappointed me in any way (other than the A70's CMOS coming loose, but that's a warranty repair, I just chose to buy a new 8MP instead of getting the old one fixed).The AiAF seems to alway pick the wrong part of the frame to focus on for me, but I turned it off and just used the center frame and a half-press of the shutter button. No problem with that method, since I grew up on Olympus OM-series SLRs.The manual focusing leaves something to be desired, since it just gives a magnified center on the LCD, and no cheats -- you have to judge sharpness on the little LCD, by eyeballing it. But you'll never need to use the MF, since the auto works perfectly from one inch to infinity if you set it to only use the center zone, then focus on what you want to be sharp and hold the shutter button halfway down while you compose. The MF does show a distance scale at the top, so you can really fine-tune it if you're willing to break out a ruler.Overall, I'd say it's as good as you can get without interchangeable lenses.

It also recommended brighter lighting which many times a person has no control over, especially if the picture is taken outside at dusk.  I had a Ricoh film camera that I loved and the red eye reduction worked everytime.

I assume it has to do with lower light inside, but it is frustrating to see a good picture on the display only to see it fuzzy when you download it.3) Sometimes it won't take pictures. I don't know if it is waiting for the flash to charge or what, but I can point at what I think is a well lit shot, push the shutter, and nothing happens.4) Frustrating that the display is more light sensitive than the camera. I wanted a picture of my baby sleeping. I could see him just great in the display (it was dark, but that is what it looks like in real life and what I wanted to capture), but the picture comes out black. You can get the picture if you play around with one of the manual modes, but it is always a guess what you will get. It would be nicer if the display was more WYSIWYG.5) Battery life is great!6) You can get great images out of this camera and 8 MP is great when you want to crop.7) I love the ability to take multiple pictures on a timer.8) The video comes out very well.9) A speck of dust appeared on the inside of the lens. I am not sure how it got there or how to get it out, but it doesn't seem to affect the pictures. Annoying, none the less.10) The software is useless unless you want to stitch pictures together.", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "GiG", "ReviewID": "R2NJIBJ3VXCJIM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been doing quite some research before I decided to go with this camera.

I know enough to take some great photos, but some of the technical terms go beyond my range of knowledge.  The camera I owned prior to purchasing the A630 was a Cannon Power Shot SD 500 (digital elph).  I loved the functions on it, but it was very light and after I broke the screen for the 2nd time... well, I decided it was time for a change.The powershot A630 uses the AA batteries which #1 let me use rechargable batteries that I keep on hand yet in a pinch I can always buy new batteries, and #2 gives the camera extra weight.  I appreciate the heft of this camera.  I find I have fewer blurry pictures due to hand-shake.  the Elph was so light that I tended to move the camera as I took the picture.but here's the part that just flat out sold me on the A630.  the swivel screen.  as a family, we often take group shots of ourselves - using the timer feature.  As we set ourselves up for the photo, we can swing the screen around so we can frame ourselves as the camera is counting down.  (I also purchased a tiny flexible tripod which helps with the framing too).  When we're not taking pix, I just turn the screen around to help protect it!  knock on wood, I haven't broken it yet!At the highest quality setting, I can only get a few pictures on the memory card, but with 8 mega pixels, even the lower settings give great quality photos.I have not explored all options/functions/features on the camera, but overall, I love it.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon A630 Good Camera.", "Author": "Penco", "ReviewID": "R128WVF2BSXRTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AI've been using a Canon F1 all my life and was a little intimidated going digital.

Then I followed the directions to install the software for connecting the camera directly to the computer.  Unfortunately, after many hours of frustration, I could not get the software installed.  However the second tech support guy I talked to about the issue was very knowledgeable and explained that I needed to reinstall Windows because I was missing a required windows file.  Otherwise, the camera is way better than my old Sony Cybershot 3 megapixel, but not only because of the megapixel difference.  The options available are excellent (panoramic stitch, nice video quality, etc).  The reason I did not give 5 stars is because it has difficulty focusing sometimes which seems to get worse when zooming in.  Perhaps all digital zooms are like this, but this is easily remedied by releasing the button, turning the camera slightly, and refocusing.  After the picture is in focus, turn the camera back to the subject and it's perfect!Overall, a much better experience than the old Sony and the memory cards are cheaper.", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great camera....!!!

The only way I could get it to work was to push extremely hard on the shutter button and it was as if it pushed something back into place.Since my camera was new I called up Canon, sent the camera to them to repair, and waited.Now, I've owned digital cameras from the time they were 1 megapixel. First a Kodak, then two Olympus, then the Canon. The only reason I got the Canon is because my Olympus cost over $1000 and the smaller camera was easier to take to places where I might get knocked around (concerts, moshpits, etc.). And I liked the cool flip screen.They sent my camera back with the problem undiagnosed, stating they cleaned it. They also stated that the camera had damage. It didn't have ANY.Fast forward, and I'm at a friend's house and I drop my camera out of my hand onto the coffee table, leaves a few dents on the case. My camera had STILL been not focusing, but I had found a quick fix - slam the bottom of it on a flat surface and it worked. Feeling that I shouldn't have paid $300 for a camera with a problem, I contact Canon again. I tell them that when I sent my camera in that it had NO damage, and the document I received back said that it did. Now that the camera had damage, my fear was that they would blame me for the malfunctioning focus, and make me pay for the repairs. I got back a form email telling me to send the camera to them.Uhm... no.I call them today and talk to someone explaining why I didn't want to send the camera back, just to see if they would simply offer to send me a replacement camera. Nope! They said that I could send it back to them at their expense, but they wouldn't know anything about the repairs until they were able to look at it.  They already DID!  So now they want to look at it and see if the new damage negates the old problem?When I looked up the problem in the database originally it didn't even give a diagnosis, it just said to send it to them for repair, so I assumed they knew what the issue was. Waste of my time and money buying this camera. And the amusing thing is that I told them I'll never buy another Canon camera and they seemed to not care. Why should they?

I've added the CHDK set of tools (guide here:[...]) and am getting awesome HDR photos and amazing tools.Sure, it has great features, but you might as well buy a fully manual camera, because you'll be messing with custom settings any time you want to take anything but a shot in ideal lighting.  Bright daylight? The photos turn out dark.  Night/low light?  Unless the subject is less than a foot away, the flash will fail to illuminate them and again - underexposure.

Burchfield", "ReviewID": "R2GH3FXYQ6J2HA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was going on vacation and needed a camera, this one reviewed well so I bought it.The manuals are too small in size, not much bigger than the camera itself, which makes them hard to read due to the small printing size (my brother's older Canon came with a manual the size of your hand- at least with that one you can read it more easily)and they (a basic and advanced manual- keep both of them because they refer to each other) seem to be written more for an experienced photographer, not the near total novice. Do buy the Nimh batteries, the supplied alkalines only ran me less than 60 shots, a second set I had along ran over 300 and my power usage wasn't really power wasteful on the first set. The Nimh batteries ought to do you better- I hope.As suggested by the manual I did practice around with the thing and got things going well enough (note: nowhere does Canon bother to tell you that the internal clock is 24 hr, not 12- I got some shots miss dated because of that- 1 pm is 13:00, not 1:00 and so on before I realized how things should be set and that there is no 12 hr setting). I generally shot my pictures in Program mode although some bright/ or overcast shots seemed to do better in Automatic- didn't really bother with most other settings. I tried the folder setting, not sure yet if I have it right, the movie setting does work well (I kept it at top resolution) but the built in microphone is useless for good sound whether you're in the windy outdoors or a relatively quite church (I did both), the built in speaker is even more of a joke. Playback on a TV or PC looks good, my current Pc is too old to meet the specs but my brother's year old laptop recognized the camera without his having to load the software. I used the close up settings (a tulip and MF) several times, tulip was good but I could never get much done with MF. The manuals don't really explain either of the icons but I did get along with tulip, my brother's Canon has a ribbed wheel to turn for MF focusing- just a crummy little lever without much control for this camera, it never would stop just where I wanted it to.I do like the flip over monitor, even though cleaning instructions aren't given that I could find, image stabilization would be nice- I deleted several shots that could've been saved if the A630 had that.I don't really regret buying the thing but Canon needs to improve a few things before I'd be really happy about my camera.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "Andrew L.

This camera is more in weight and the biggest problem is picture quality when light is midium or low.

The light in banquest hall and basement was really good enough for taking pictures as other cannon camera with 5MP did really good job where as this A630 completely failed to show good results. each pictures was yellow, I try to take it using night shot, that was even worst as there was alreay enought light.
