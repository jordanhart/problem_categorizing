The 4mm angel is good enough.  It is actually very close to a 3.6mm.  I couldn't see the difference.  I usually never install this camera with the power supply plug type.  I like to use a CCTV 9 channel power supply.  Then I can tie in all camera's to one location.  Less of a mess and one board that controls all cameras.I also like the fact that should I run conduit to the camera there is a 3/4 threaded hole there.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera for indoor use", "Author": "Rick   \"Communications Tech\"", "ReviewID": "R4ISH8R03C9KK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've installed (3) of these cameras indoors in an existing system. The clarity was excellent and the night vision was good.The only issue I've had was the OSD menu button that is attached to the pigtail cable. The housing does not have large enough storage space to hide the button. Either you mount a surface box or bury the button and connectors behind the wall or ceiling.For under $100 you can't beat the price.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT product! fast shipping!", "Author": "joel \"JAZZY JOEL PRODUCTIONS \"Quality eve...", "ReviewID": "R26B4RQCIRMYN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "quality, fast, will order again /// pro awesome super fast shipping great price to quality ratio.

Quality picture even at 0 LUX great product, it definitely  requires technical skill to adjust/ focus the camera but well worth it to add to my installation inventory!", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed, waste my money", "Author": "Tarik", "ReviewID": "R31GZPIK14M213", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Frankly, I expected better for this price. But the clarity was pretty poor. Very cloudy images at night. My $49 first alert system produced clearer pictures with better facial recognition. I thought it very important to enlighten potential buyers as I believe that these are too expensive to be classified as disposable cameras. I would not recommend this camera.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Image is low res and IR lights burn out quickly", "Author": "Mercy2915", "ReviewID": "R26L6P6B8WKE3W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Advertised as 700 TVL but it looks more like 400. After 3 weeks 6 IR LEDs had burnt out. Plus there is a PTZ joystick on the video cable, however this camera is a manual PTZ. So it just makes the wire bulky and needlessly thick. Daytime image is OK but nighttime image has tons of noise. The dome is super cheap plastic, easy to scuff and scratch which makes image even worse. There is nothing professional about this camera.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Feels Good but forgot to order power adaptor separately", "Author": "N. Malik \"New Contractor\"", "ReviewID": "R9V6YJSFR65VQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just writing to let you know that i missed the part where the description clearly states, power adaptor not included. So you should know that the body of this camera feels good and probably made of a metal. it's not plastic.  the camera feel strong and not delicate. The power/video cord on the back can be run through a wall while the camera is mounted to the wall or re-routed through a side slot from the back too so you dont have to drill a hole and mount it on top of it. The base has three holes for mounting and comes with three anchor screws as well as an allen key for unscrewing the face, i assume, to adjust the manual focus. I gave three stars because i can't power it up yet. will get back to those who remain patient.UPDATE:  03/16/2013So I used some old adapter to power it up and installed it outside the front steps.  It works great. Setup took a while since the dome had to be taken off and it took some time to position/rotate the camera and use the pre-installed setup menu.  It's Much better than the standard camera's that came with  my dvr.  The night vision range is great although there are street lamps outside. And the clarity/focus is much better than my old camera.I am satisfied and will order more.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$190.00", "Features": "Professional Outdoor IR dome camera, 1/3\" SONY CCD, 700 TV lines, Vari-Focal 4~9mm manual lens.
