A Gibson", "ReviewID": "R3UQS3IMR7GFC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used nearly every OLYMPUS dSLR (exception being the E-300 & E-400).  I use the Olympus E-3 for my paid work and find it a superb camera.  But like many of you, I want a camera with SLR quality to carry around minus the weight of my workhorse E-3.  Enter the E-420, an absolute jewel of a camera whose IQ is top notch especially when compared to its market segment (Canon Rebels, Nikon D40/D60/D80, Pentax K200D, etc.).  The gradation is fantastic, rivaling even my E-3.  And coupling this, the world's smallest dSLR body with the new Pancake lens (25mm f/2.8, equivalant to 50mm in Full Frame) and you have a near 'pocketable' (depends on the size of the pocket) dSLR capable of taking phenomenal photos.  Now, is it a world beater?  No.  But it isn't meant to be.  It is meant for folks who want SMALL, but for whom Image Quality MATTERS.  And here, it scores a perfect 10 (or 5 STARS in this case).  As to the negative comment about focus points (you want 51 focus points, go spend 5K on the Nikon D3... truly a great camera, but marketed to a different segment of shutterbugs).  And I have no idea what the reviewer was talking about poor performance in low light (this is much more of a lens issue on any camera), all I can say is NONSENSE.  It does fine.  No better and certainly no worse than any of the other 20+ dSLRs I've shot with.  In fact, I used it as a 2nd camera during a 50th wedding anniversary party I was hired to shoot.  Used it Indoors.  It did great.  I got great photos and the client doesn't know what came out of the E-3 or the E-420.  The images are that good.  So if you want 'pocketable', but you do want to compromise on Image Quality, then go ahead and pick this baby up.  The likelihood of Buyer's Remorse is far smaller than this camera.  After that, You just do one thing more.  ...Enjoy.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sold my Canon XTi for this delightful *gem* of a camera. Love it!", "Author": "Tony Wong", "ReviewID": "R8XCPGWCL1BP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this E-420 with Zuiko 25mm Pancake for a month now and it is simply superb.I sold my Canon XTi and SD700IS because I wanted a smaller/lighter system without sacrificing DSLR image quality. I got portability with my Canon P&S; but not the image quality; I got DSLR image quality with the Canon DSLR but not the portability. The question was: What should I do? Well, the timing of the release of this camera/lens was perfect. And the choice to get this camera was the best choice I have made with regards to photography. Now I have the smallest, lightest DSLR camera in the world with great image quality to match any 10MP entry-level DSLR. Having owned this camera for over a month now, I have realised that I am taking 2-3 times more photographs than ever before simply because it is such a joy to take out-and-about (perfect for street photography) and the results I am getting are excellent. Want to see images from this combination? Have a look at my photostream: [...])From using this camera, I am looking forward to exploring more of Olympus's infamous Zuiko lenses which are some of the best digital lenses in the industry. I tried the 12-60mm lens with the E-420 the other day and boy was the auto-focus speed fast! The continuous shooting is fast too: 3-4 shots (raw+super-fine jpegs) per second -- very impressive.Because of this purchase my passion for photography has been ignited which is priceless in itself. Photography should be about taking photos without feeling restricted by what you hold in your hands. This camera gives me that freedom and confidence that I can take great photos wherever I am. Photography should be FUN! And it is certainly FUN to use this camera.To conclude, do your research on the net on this camera and look at many photos. I am sure you will discover many other happy new owners of this camera. I have heard even some are using it not as a back-up to their pro gear but as a replacement because it is so portable! A great recommendation if ever you need one.Happy camera hunting!", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "I love my E420, but it does have a few issues", "Author": "Bruce Arthur", "ReviewID": "R21FKGJZZVECTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in hopes of replacing my point and shoot. In the past, I have just missed too many shots because my point and shoot was too slow, or because it focused on the wrong object, or just had the wrong exposure. So I was looking for small DSLR, and when this camera came out with the pancake lens, I wanted to give it a try. My personal experience has been with a few different kinds of cameras, Canon A2, Yashica T4, Canon S100, Canon Digital Rebel, and a Minolta G500.  I rated this camera as a single unit consisting of the body and the 25mm f/2.8 pancake lens. My tests have taken about 3 weeks and include two family vacations.Quality of the images (not including user error): 5/5Ease of Use: 4/5Feel: 5/5Live View mode: 2/5Advanced modes, Manual Mode, and manual focus: 3/5Fun: 5/5Ease of use for handing to others: 5/5Speed of use (not including Live View): 5/5Overall: 4/5Strengths:  First off, the camera feels great. Even though it is small, it feels solid, it has a nice smooth shutter with a pleasing sound. The camera feels good in my hands. It feels better than my Digital Rebel. I have had two instances in which someone else dropped the camera from a height of 3 feet, and it has been fine. I have carried it in all kinds of bags with other gear and it appears to be very sturdy.  The quality of the images I get is very good. In day light or normal indoor light, I get great images. The only limit on the quality is the skill of the photographer. I took a number of shots in low light (campfires and candle light), and those pictures look OK but not great. In those conditions I got pictures better than my point and shoot cameras, but not as good as I get with my Digital Rebel with an f/1.4 lens. I am not a professional photographer, so my standards may not be all that high, but I love the pictures I get.  The biggest pleasant surprise of this camera was the Info display. There is an \"Info\" button that bring us a display showing all of the important settings. And the special part is that you can easily navigate to any setting and change it directly from that mode. I really love this. It makes it very easy to change the metering mode, and to check if I left the camera in any strange mode (IS0 1600, or manual focus mode).  I have also given the camera to my wife and daughters to use. They were able to use it without any problems.  I thought the Auto ISO selection works quite well. It only boosts the ISO when required.  Finally, I find this camera to be lots of fun. I usually find any new camera to be fun, but this one has really captured my imagination. I felt the same way about the Digital Rebel when I first purchased it. I find myself taking it many places and getting lots of good pictures.Weaknesses and issues:  My main complaint is that the camera is not small enough to replace my point and shoot. This is not a defect, just a realization on my part that the worlds smallest DSLR is not small enough. My next issue is that some pictures do not have the subject in proper focus. This camera makes fewer autofocus mistakes than a point and shoot, but my Digital Rebel does better. I suspect this is a function of the 3 focus points, but I don't know for sure.  I tried to focus the camera manually, but I was not able to reliably get the subject in focus. I am not great at focusing manually, but this camera did not make it easy.  The E420 does have a live view mode, that allows you to compose the picture using the LCD. I was eager to try this, and I found it very disappointing. After pressing the shutter, the camera moves the lens through a wide range of focus points before taking the picture. So the time it takes to the capture the picture is way too long. Sadly, this really defeats my interest in live view. I was able to improve the shot time by changing the auto focus mode, but it's still not fast.  Finally, I have some smaller gripes. None of these is a terrible problem, but they did annoy me. First, Olympus includes an eye piece cover, and they sized it such that it fits into the hot shoe. Sadly, it fails out too easily, and I have almost lost it several times.  Face detection seems like a good idea, but it is slow enough that I do not use it.  After using the camera to take pictures of the stars at night, I mistakenly left the focus mode in manual, and the ISO set to 1600. Sadly, neither of those settings are visible in the view finder so I took quit a few shots that had out of focus subjects and a grainy appearance.  The lens cap must be screwed off. I would prefer one that was removed by a pinch.  Finally, there is one really odd item. The focus ring on the camera is not physically attached to the lens elements. This means that moving the ring does nothing if you are in the fully automatic modes, and it means that you do not get any physical feedback when you have reached the end of the focus range. While this is not a terrible problem, it really seemed weird to me.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Gadget Man \"Gadget Man\"", "ReviewID": "R28XCO890LEABN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I buy two or three cameras a year.  I hesitated on this camera because it has no image stabilization.  But I recently took it to Europe and got great pictures in churches and museums.

After many years of photography, going all the way back to the sixties, my nostalgia for certain elements of the old ways has been satisfied by this camera. The compact size, the light weight, the prime lenses, the high quality and the ability to shoot with the feeling that the camera and I are one -- all are quite wonderful.  The pancake lens is so comfortable and convenient, I am quite willing to overcome its lack of perfection -- it's more than good enough. And the 50mm is for me the sharpest lens, with some of the most beautiful images that I have had in many yearsOlympus Evolt E420 10MP Digital SLR Camera with 25mm f/2.8 Pancake Zuiko Lens.  And, peculiarly, I am thrilled that this camera focuses so dependably. I've used lots of Nikons and Canons. In recent years, I've suffered a lot from erratic focusing, mostly with the Canon DSLRs.

Langham", "ReviewID": "RE7FKDS8QT5WZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this refurbished camera with the kit lens for $320 from Amazon/Adorama. It arrived in five days.First, the bad news...--Saying the E-420 is the world's smallest dSLR is like winning the prize for \"the world's lightest 200 pound supermodel\". This is not a small camera. Play with one before you buy it because there is no way this camera is fitting into any pocket.--Image quality is slightly soft (but can be turned sharp by turning off the noise filter).--Very cramped viewfinder at about 50% magnification (apparent size of things is halved). In addition, critical info is places to the right of the viewfinder.--Poor ergonomics between shutter, aperture, ISO via a single multifunctional dial. Please, Olympus, give us two dials.--Somewhat slow autofocus in poor light (but very fast if you know what you're doing and read the helpful instructional manual).--Poor resolution LCD but if you're like me you just use the LCD to check highlights then you won't care.--No mechanical image stabilization. IS is most useful in the critical 1/4 to 1/125 shutter speed. I find myself there a lot so it would be nice to have.--Compactflash only.--Poor battery life at ~150 shots (but can be doubled with $10 aftermarket rechargeable).Now for the good news...--Its a real dSLR! You're just not going to find any dSLR at this price range and its build quality absolutely doesn't feel cheap.--Smaller than any other dSLR. Other dSLR's feel enormous.--100% viewfinder coverage? You take the picture and there's no cropping. You get what you see.--Really good kit lens.--Very fast operation...if you read the manual and practice. Otherwise, like most cameras of this sort, if you don't have a fundamental understand of the compromises between shutters speed, aperture, and ISO then the camera just pukes on you if you ask it to do something unreasonable.--Smart flash with a great number of options. I'd still recommend a more powerful external flash (I use a tl20) for daylight photography.--Super-fast and easy adjustable exposure compensation.--Fast white-balance adjustment (but might take two button clicks and eyes off the prize to set it).If you're getting into SLR photography and you don't want to spend a lot of money then this is the camera to get. This is not an easy camera to use but if you read the manual and practice with it then the camera is very fast.

Keeling", "ReviewID": "R15F4EVGNM92DL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chose the E-420 over similar offerings from Canon and Nikon because this camera just felt better in my hands. Small, light weight, no big old grip on the right side of the camera. All these reasons are really personal preferences as you really have to get technical to see the differences in image quality; which there are. But if you are like me, shoot a lot of images, print a few 4 X 6s and fewer 8 X 10s, store your pictures on your computer and email pictures to family and friends  now and then, the E-420 will serve you well. Do I need to tell you that you should purchase from amazon.com?  I didn't think so.Sept 1, 2009 updateShot a lady's tennis tournament today and the E-420 with 40 to 150 mm lens performed very well. Out of over 300 shots, only 4 were out of focus. The 4 bad shots were the first images in continuous shot sequences. Once I figured this out and pre focused prior to shooting, the problem went away.  Just used the sport mode and let the camera figure out the settings.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pretty Nice Camera", "Author": "Alejandro \"Alejandro\"", "ReviewID": "R1GOBHLAEYM9XH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I was deciding between this, the E510/520, Canon's line, and Sony's. The thing about Canon is it's more expensive, even while you get better quality photos. Also, you miss out on the bells and whistles this camera's got, with live view, dust reduction, better kit lens, etc. Sony would have been what I'd gone with, had size not been an issue. For some people, there won't be much of an issue with size, but since I preferred a small camera, the difference was massive; Sony's lines are great, but only because they make their cameras quite a bit large that Olympus's. Also, the E420 has a nice improvement in terms of image quality and noise over the old E410, (which I wouldn't have bought. Image quality was just too poor on that old model) and the E510, and to be honest, the difference between it and Sony becomes negligible in everyday outdoor use and party/occasional indoor use upon close-up inspection. For prints and smaller images, there is no difference in noise, and you can easily compensate for the occasional over/under exposure. Really, for me, I was looking for a camera that could take good pictures, be handy, and come with some nice extras. Olympus met all those brilliantly, as did Sony did minus the 'handy' part. If you're worried about quality, don't worry unless blown-up images are your main concern. Then you might even want to invest more than the E420's price range and get yourself a slightly more expensive SLR altogether. Oh, and I would have loved the E520 (which is not much bigger, all said and done), but it wasn't coming out on time. IS (Image Stabilization) is real handy for night and low-light indoor shots, and if you're in need of a camera for that, go ahead and get the E520, it just wasn't available when I bought the E420. Good buy so far, nice bang/buck!", "Date": "June 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "A lovely camera, surprisingly small!", "Author": "R. Sarma \"rssarma\"", "ReviewID": "RCROAENSF2DN9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a couple of months now and I am nothing short of satisfied with this camera's look, feel, size and quality. For starters, this camera is really small! I always knew that it was touted as the world's smallest, but it really is that tiny! If used along with the pancake lens, this camera can be carried around all day in your jacket/coat pocket and will make an excellent tool for street photography. I also own an E-510 and other than the missing IS, I would say this camera has improved a lot over the E-x10 series.For starters, the JPEG engine and the new sensor are a noticeable improvement and this shows in the image quality. The camera also has a much better dynamic range and doesn't clip highlights like the E-510, which makes it very easy to use. The auto WB isn't as accurate as the E-510 though and it does have a tendency to make colors a little warmer, but this still looks really nice and isn't really a problem.Noise is also very well controlled and even at ISO 1600, the noise is very fine grained and not intrusive as such.In response to the other poster, the AF speed on this camera is plenty fast and extremely accurate and doesn't lack anywhere. The live view with face detection is an excellent feature when clicking group pictures or handing the camera to someone else to take pictures. Contrast-detect AF is slightly slow, but works as intended and is also quite accurate (not as accurate as TTL phase detect AF).Overall, for the price, this is an excellent package and great value for money. This camera is also the ideal camera if you want something you can carry around everywhere without compromising on image quality.

I bought a Nikon all manual camera when I was in the service overseas and back some years sold the camera to get a video camera!!! Big mistake! I looked for a new manual film recently and decided to go digital. That was my best decision. I researched all the digital cameras and compared price and features and I decided on the olympus. This was an even bigger good decision. The camera is fast, no lag time for shutter to actually take the picture. I love the rapid multi picture feature. It snaps pics one after another with no lag time!!!! I love it! The most important feature is the picture itself, they are very sharp and excellent detail in macro mode. I take pics of flowers close up and they look like pictures in photography magazines. I looked at the nikon D40 and thought this was a better camera. The lens is excellent!!!You can't go wrong with this camera. i did manual film for years and this is so much better and has the ability to do all manual if you like. The menus are very good. I love the camera!!!!!Revised review 12/30/2013:I am selling this camera now for one reason and going with a Nikon D3200. The camera has a very big problem focusing in low light situations with the flash. It will continually try to focus and if the flash comes on briefly to illuminate the subject it just continually keeps flashing and trying to focus. Sometimes it will finally focus and take the picture. Other times it will try to focus and simply wont take the picture. That being said I cant take away the fact that out side in good lighting the pictures are just fabulous. In some lower light times again it has a focusing problem.I strive to make accurate reviews to protect other customers.", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "My first SLR", "Author": "S.

That said I found the time some months down the line and actually read through the instruction manual that you can download for free from the Olympus website; and then its OK to work with as a hobby photographer.While it is compact, it is quite hefty and not as light as some of the newer SLRs out there; but for the price I was willing to take that into account. Plus, I like to know I am holding something in my hands - helps me think about balance and angle a bit more.I also think that pictures, indoors and in low lighting, with the in-built flash it comes with, are really bad and so I will need to invest in an add-on external flash soon.I prefer using the manual eyelet to frame the picture versus the screen, because the screen slows down taking the shot by quite a bit; however, since I learned taking and framing pictures on an old antique Pentax, this (and the manual zoom on the lens) is actually a nice little bit of nostalgia each time I frame and focus.What is really irksome is that it uses an Olympus memory card which cost me an extra $20 to purchase (only 2GB) - I do prefer the SD cards especially since they slot into all sorts of other gadgets I have (i.e. are more versatile) and have loads more capacity.The 'yay!' (the great): That said, it takes the MOST BEAUTIFUL shots with this lens (14-42mm), particularly close ups, when the light is there. I am currently considering buying the pancake lens as an addition to see how that frames photos and, of course, an external flash. Perhaps taking pictures with those will change my star rating in future.I was also able to purchase a replacement battery for all of $10 and both batteries last ages in comparison to the other SLR I own; plus they are really easy to transport and recharge (takes only a half hour); and exceptionally easy to switch when empty.As you can tell more 'blah' than 'yay!' - hence the 3 stars. However I was able to revive my other SLR and it was a decent buy so I didn't return it... Now it works great as a 2nd camera in my opinion, and I would recommend as such rather than as a 1st and/or one and only.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great DSLR starter", "Author": "jink", "ReviewID": "R2HO9UHITO6FNO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've used this DSLR around the world for more than 3 years now.Pros:- Small, compact, lightweight (+small lightweight lenses)- Great image quality in good light, on par with all other cameras in this range- raw->JPG is great, you almost don't need to do RAW processing for most pics- Lots of features, great interfaceCons:- No in-body image stabilization (ALL other Oly cameras have it!)- Bad high-ISO performance- Shutter/mirror-slap a tad loud- Will be antiquated b/c of Olympus PEN lineOverall:I've taken great pictures with this camera. I've also taken a lot of pictures I know were limited by the camera, and that a slightly bigger camera (like the E-510) or a camera from a different brand would have handled great.If I could do it again, I wouldn't get it. I don't like the Olympus DSLR system anymore, it's going to be cut off b/c of micro Four-Thirds and the PEN series. Format's a bit too small, which compromises too much, and prevents you from \"growing\" with the system - their best camera body and lenses (except super-telephotos) are the same size and weight as competing brands, thus negating their original size advantage it had on the low-end models.So if this is the last DSLR you ever buy, that's fine. If you like the challenge of no image-stabilization and want to discipline your tripod use, go for it. If you ever think you'll improve and want a bigger camera/format, it's better to change systems, or never buy Olympus in the first place. If you have to buy Olympus for compactness and ease of use get the E-510, which has image stabilization.In-depth pros:Lots of features that you'd expect on higher end models, like remote shutter (add-on, can buy on ebay for cheap), timing of curtans, mirror slap, and shutter movement, easy and straight-to-the-point menu interface design. The interface really is great, you can see all pertinent settings all at once, and arrow around and use the jog dial to change them without clicking through hierarchies. Other DSLR brands just seem clunky after using this.Lenses are light and cheap enough. They are smaller than the competition, but not by much.In-depth cons:This camera's great for everything except the corner cases. After 3 years, I really, really wish it had better low-light performance. There are three reasons for this: four-thirds, high-ISO performance, and lack of image stabilization.Four-thirds sensor has some limitations that weren't obvious until I had been shooting a while. It's small, which affects depth-of-field (has a huge depth-of-field compared to larger formats, so harder to achieve that \"blurry background\" effect even with the best lenses), and gives bad high-ISO performance and bad low-light performance.ISO 800 and 1600 show a lot of noise, and when comparing it to other cameras of the same price range/size/ISO, it's a lot worse, not just in sharpness/noise, but CONTRAST. Good contrast can make up for noise, as in other camera brands/models, but this has poor contrast and color in low light. And don't listen to people who yell \"Get a tripod!\" You going to bring a tripod into a bar? or dim restaurant? What about your moving subjects? You'll have no choice but to pump up ISO to prevent their movements from blurring, thus you'll get a messier picture that a slightly bigger camera would have taken easier.Image stabilization is one of the biggest advantages of going with Olympus system - ALL bodies EXCEPT the E-420 include it. That means ANY lens you put on is image stabilized. Almost no Olympus lenses have IS, b/c they assumed you should have gotten any other Oly body that includes it anyway. In-body IS is a feature all other brands don't include. Yet if you buy the E-420, you lose the one major advantage of Olympus. If you still want the Olympus system, get the E-510 instead. Slightly bigger size/weight + image stabilization.Other comments:The Four-Thirds format has popularized the mirror-less cameras, like the EP-1 and all those prosumer nearly-DSLR digital cameras. Unfortunately, that leaves cameras like the E-420 in the dust, and feeling unsupported, and gives a certain sign that the DSLR line will be phased out.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Olympus E420", "Author": "bigz", "ReviewID": "R18LX4ZU23WFPW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm still learning how to use this camera since it's my first camera...ever. Thus far it's perfect for my amateur eyes and great for teaching yourself about taking pictures and working a digi single reflex lens camera. The camera is a nice small size, but not small enough for your cargo pants pocket. It's easy to use if you're always shooting in automatic or in a mode. I shoot mostly in manual so its a bit more complicated, still figuring it out. It's been about two months and this camera has really helped me understand the whole concept of aperture and speed. Again, not a photographer, but great camera.Downside? Memory cards are expensive. Although supposedly Microdrives aren't made anymore so that's one step towards making this camera obsolete. Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong. For beginners, patience. This camera is a computer that takes pictures. Don't let the techie talk discourage you. The manual is your bible.

I am social photographer and this camera is very frustrating and dissapointing, the flashing on the subject to autofocus takes forever. Other systems in the same price range use 9 point autofocus , this camera only has 3 points. Also others use an constant light to illuminate on autofocus, this uses the pop flashing and it is practically useless. Outdoor image quality is very good. The liveview preview autofocus and face recognition is less effective than other inexpensive point and click cameras.
