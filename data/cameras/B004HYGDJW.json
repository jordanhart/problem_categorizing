{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sweet little camera in my pocket", "Author": "DD", "ReviewID": "R9R1LJWGD03AX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this little camera so that I could carry it in my pocket and indeed, the size is perfect for a pocket, purse, on a cord tucked inside your shirt.  The pictures are clear and sharp, the video is also clear and sharp, but the microphone is rather useless as on playback it is nearly impossible to hear what is recorded.  The only problem I find with this camera is that it is SO tiny and the finish SO slick, that it is tricky to handle with one hand and shoot.  I am a horseback rider and have only one hand free to use the camera, and without a grip or a surface that does not easily slip out of your fingers, it is a bit unhandy, which is the reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5.Overall, this is a great camera that you can carry on your person, point and shoot in a blink, and performs very well.  Excellent Amazon service, as always.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "A good camera for the price, it gets the job done...", "Author": "B. G. Pittman III", "ReviewID": "R2T3QX3UFHOCC5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for traveling aboard while at work. It's small and lightweight, it will easily fit into your top pocket of your shirt or any other pocket. Most of the pictures that I have taken with it, have turned out great, and most people that have looked at them have committed on what good picture it takes. The only reason I gave it four stars was because sometimes it has a little hard time focusing on certain objects, mostly long distance...like sea and sky pictures. But my 2,000+ dollar Digital SLR sometimes has that same problem. But overall I am very well pleased with this camera. I bought the Amazon 32 gig card to go in it, so that I make sure that I don't run out of picture storage space before I can get to a computer to download the pictures to. The battery will last for a good long time too!", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "My experience", "Author": "JAIRO TABORDA", "ReviewID": "R1H7VNOBEASQ6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is excellent and very simple operation.

They all seem to break in about a year.", "Author": "terster \"Terster\"", "ReviewID": "R3MF5CEXZ6H1H9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've gone through 3 Casio camera's in the past 18 months.  Every single time it's LENS ERROR.  This is without bumping, without dropping, without banging the camera, etc.First my wife's camera... and then not even 30 days later, mine went out.  My wife's camera was 13 months old where as mine was 5.  Either way... they were both still pretty darn new!I've seen many others if you search... that have the same issues.Casio, per other reviews, is notorious for blaming that the camera was bumped or dropped and nulling the warranty.My most current camera, this one only in Red, broke on me too.  LENS ERROR... and it was being used at the time!Casio, however, did warrant and fix the camera no questions asked so cudo's to them for that.  The camera was only 5 months old.Due to the poor experiences i've had though, i bought a Panasonic DMC SZ7K.  It had almost perfect reviews.Well, the Panasonic showed up before Casio returned my camera fixed and now i can for the first time in many years, compare 2 different camera's.I have truly been a Casio die-hard, until now.The differences in camera's is absolutely night and day.  The Panasonic wins, hands down.  It's cleaner, it is easily 2x faster in turning on and between taking pictures.  It has a burst mode which is really awesome.  The quality of the pictures both during the day and evening, inside and out, is again, incredible.I would not, could not, recommend Casio anymore.  I've burned through 5 of these in only 5 years and as mentioned 3 in the past 18 months.No matter what people buy, i can't stress enough to get a screen protector though.  They are like $5.00 here on Amazon and they work amazingly well.  Your screen will get scratched up over time and these things will protect the camera.  My wife had a Kodak.  IT was dropped by accident on the cement below.  It shattered the corner of the lens protector but the camera remained undamaged in any way.  I pulled off the old protector, got a new one here on amazon and the camera was good to go.Had this been the Casio... 99.99% chance of a LENS ERROR.I just don't understand what's happened to Casio!8 years ago... they would last you 5.  Now, anything less than 2 years... you're lucky to get the full 1 year before they die.  They just are not what they used to be, in our opinion.We now have the Panasonic as mentioned and my wife replaced her Casio with an Olympus and she's super pleased with hers too.  BOTH were under $100... and easily are worth more like $165 in our opinions.Save yourself the coming headache's... keep looking.Due to the the LENS ERROR and now due to how vastly superior both the Olympus and the Panasonic camera's are when compared to this one... i rate this only 2 stars.I do give Casio credit though for not arguing with me with regard to fixing mine and turnover was pretty fast, inside of 2 weeks.  I didn't even have to call them.  Just an online form and mailing it back. Done.But, to learn now by buying 2 other ones... i would not buy Casio again for a long time.For what it's worth.T", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "great item at a great price", "Author": "proud moma", "ReviewID": "R2TDUQQ5EL8FPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were very impressed with the quality of this item.

Judd \"Art Quilter\"", "ReviewID": "RPWPX005KAIXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been getting adjusted to this very slim version of a camera. Holding it is a bit more of a challenge even with small hands and thin fingers. I just took it on a 5 day Boundary Waters trip in September and it took gorgeous photos as long as I didn't zoom in too closely. The high resolution of the camera even at just the 6mb size images makes it difficult to get clear photos without the tripod when zooming in. I didn't have that issue with my previous Casio, but it only took 10mb images at its max setting.I would have preferred the previous charger options where you could charge the battery outside the came instead of having to do it while in the camera as I always have a spare battery but can deal with that by just having 2 spare batteries.Downloading time to my computer is really quick which I like as well. I use the Adobe Bridge software so all of my images are custom named and my copyright is automatically imbedded in each image.I would highly recommend this camera as it is sleek, compact and easy to use.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product", "Author": "CharlyO", "ReviewID": "R25TG79IYY6IZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this product to replace a lost one....but without the need to expend too much money; I was affraid that because it was a used one may be the quality and appreance not so good....but I was surprise to see a product like a new one and with the same functionality ...you never know when you are going to find a used product with such good quality and price.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, weak Battery", "Author": "Inspector John", "ReviewID": "R1ZHDH5W8LUQEP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is very nice, easy to hold and shoot.

The previous model took great pictures and was incredibly reliable.  After 5+ years, the screen of the older model was damaged when I sat on it while it was in my back pocket...my fault.  The newer model couldn't have been more of a disappointment.  The shutter speed was slower and the lense mechanism has been rendered utterly useless after only 8 months of use.
