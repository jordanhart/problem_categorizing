{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Looxcie - Small Camera Easy to Use and Fun", "Author": "Rita Macdonald", "ReviewID": "R39HUG92KNIVD2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera because it fits in with what I am doing and blends into my outfit better than the bigger action cameras that need to be mounted on a helmet. I never wear a helmet, so could not make one of those action cameras hands free. This Looxcie 3 allows me to record or stream what I am doing with my friends and family and because it is small, people do not get self-conscious when they are being recorded. I put in a 32G card, so I can record about 10 hours of 720 video. I plan to use it on family trips and for the family get togethers over the holidays. This pack comes with a bunch of mounting options. I liked to use the lanyards/necklaces.With the mobile app it streams live to Facebook, so you can share your activities in real time. The HD video recordings look good and it can do still photos too. Overall, I am happy so far.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Social Camera Takes Gadget to Possible Accessory", "Author": "Riki N.", "ReviewID": "R11PHPBSXB1FKQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a happy owner of a Looxcie HD, so I was psyched to get the new Looxcie 3 and explore what the company calls their social video cam.The product looks good in the package and is straightforward to remove by twisting the plastic screw. As with other cameras in the category, you need to provide your own microSD card. The camera is small and light, and the Social Pack gives you a wide number of ways to wear it. It comes with a social clip to attach to your clothes, 2 lanyards, a hat clip, a mini-tripod with a sticky pad and two rubber covers in white and red. The rubber covers are fun and give a layer of protection to the camera. And they have 3 more colors in a separate accessory pack and they offer a waterproof case.The camera works standalone and it works with their mobile app for IOS and Android. I am an Android user and found the app pretty straightforward and it allows you to stream live videos to friends on Facebook. The recorded video is 720p/30fps and for how small it is and the price of the camera, the video quite sharp.Because it is small and light and you can wear it against the body and because it streams hands free, the Looxcie 3 works as a social camera.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay camera, but Looxcie is pulling out of consumer market", "Author": "Joel Goodson \"joelgoodsn\"", "ReviewID": "RBIKP4WOXP48I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera and iPhone software are okay. I was pleasantly surprised by its small size. It is quite a bit smaller than the GoPro.  Seems to take a long time to charge.I was disported to see on the Looxcie website that they are basically abandoning the consumer market to focus on the business market. The site says they'll continue to support their products... but I've seen how that usually goes.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera!", "Author": "Terry Burgess", "ReviewID": "R18VV7HRX5TX5R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first looxcie camera, and so far so good. The package was sleek and efficient. The reason I purchased it was to use as a dash cam (driving in SF can be a little crazy, so the documentation is great). It's small size, and ability to be removed quickly and easily are major selling points. Getting the camera up and running was simple and took little time. The video quality is adequate for my purposes. I did have a little trouble streaming to Facebook, but chalked that up to user error. Overall, very happy with the camera, and only deducting 1 star because there is not any internal memory, but can purchase it separately.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "exspensive paper weight", "Author": "growgreen", "ReviewID": "RPFBOTVTYY5GF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Total piece of junk and waste of money. wasted almost 150.00 bucks on this camera . won't connect to my phone says out of range even though it's sitting 3 inches away and the looxcie app is also useless .

Comparatively it is smaller than the GoPro and the video quality is more or less the same. They could work on the lighting and contrast ratios and the audio quality. The 100 degree wide angle lens was also a big selling point - anything less makes POV documenting a struggle.Great mounting options included in the Social Pack. Battery life could be longer (it gets about 90 minutes of recording) but I own a USB charging battery pack that I travel with, so this isn't a big issue. I bought a 64GB microSD card - holds about 10 hours of video. You could get by with less, but they aren't very expensive these days.The app is kind of a flop for me. I don't use the social sharing part, and it probably uses a lot of cellular data. The coolest feature is the continuous recording mode. Clicking the record button saves the last 30 seconds of footage to memory. This is a great way to save editing time/memory and ensure that you don't miss an unexpected incredible shot.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "H.

It can be hard to catch them doing funny things when you're holding a leash. :)  Plus a little CYA when runing into a loose dog, etc.The still shots aren't as good as I'd like and still playing around w/the best placement. This may require a diy solution, especially since I'm not really digging the social clip/lanyard. The clip requires an \"edge\" and even then I'd worry about it staying during activity. Tho the fact the clip rotates 360\u00b0 minimizing the worry about tilted pictures.  The lanyard is as secure as the picture illustrates. Unfortunately, the metal lobster claw clacking against the plastic clip adds to the the background noise during filming.I'll second Joel Goodson \"joelgoodsn\" in that it seems to take a long time to charge.  Thankfully I have \"tablet grade\" (2.1A) chargers so that's what I use to charge it whenever I can.However, I'm happy with the video quality.  And since I choose to go with a like new item from an Amazon Marketplace Seller I think I got a great product for the price I paid.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "The app is a downer, but the camera is nice!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RW313VL1OLX3H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I tried using Looxcie's app on my android phone to no avail.

The angle is adjustible and so is the tilt to ensure proper aim.The mobile app let's me make sure the camera is aimed properly.Con's:I'm not 100% happy with the battery life, I am using it in the cold so that probably isn't helping, but I'm getting more like an hour, hour and a half vs the advertised 2 hours and I'm not even recording for that entire time.Temperature sensitive - doesn't seem to work properly below -20 deg C (0 deg F) - turns on, but the moment I start recording, it shuts down.

Hasten", "ReviewID": "RX7HURT8IQA66", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was one of the fortunate followers of Looxcie who won a free Loxcie 3. I almost gave up registering every day in their daily give-a-way contest. I was getting ready to buy one for Christmas when notified that I won. That is a great price for the perfect action camera. The camera is built to last. You have so many ways to attach it to your body, You should be able to create a video doing just about anything. There doesn't appear to be anything cheep about this product. The only downside is the Live steaming process. They do not spell out that you need WiFi connectivity simultaneously with G4 cell phone connectivity. I would have preferred to use my iPad Air instead of my iPhone 5s. And yes, I know my iPad has Cell data connectivity available, but I do not need to be charged $30.00 an month just to use my iPad with my Looxcie 3 camera. I won't be doing much Live steaming to the internet anyway-. All in all, this is an affordable addition to anyone's video creation products.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect Cam Moments", "Author": "Joel Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R1UK7SW6A6NQ7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Looxcie 3 is the Best!! This mini cam unit is so amazing, I was able to record videos during my family vacation. Not only that, it recorded 720p. So clear during playback and it takes great pictures too when you switch modes.  The social pack had everything I needed to start off, Contained protective cases in different colors which was a must because I always droping my cell phone. Came with a clip for the cam which I wore the whole time, Lanyards for too.  I clipped my cam hopped on all the rides at the amusement park and it was memorable moments in action!! Roller coaster rides recorded. Wow!  Can't beat that for the value of a recording cam/camera. My cell phone battery life was saved without charging up, especially a whole day without outlets to charge.  The looxcie 3 did all the work, without having to hold it all the time because I was wearing it.The social pack also came with a cam mount that I place in my car, recording beautiful sceanery while driving. Nice..  A Looxcie 3 must. You just have to try it!!! Great value too!!! Too much to explain the experience...next I'm getting the water proof case for jet skiing. Try that with a cell phone!!", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "This little guy is great", "Author": "William S.

My only difficulty was getting the setup to marry-up to MAC, but Windows was a breeze. In my present use, a 32g micro sd is just fine. Overall, this little guy is great and only a real knit-picker would find otherwise.

Picture quality, ease of use, portability, and of course the price, make this a no-brainer if you just want to have a quick alternative to pulling out your phone and going through the numerous steps to record video on the fly. It fits easily in the palm of the hand and lends itself to one-handed operation.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Looxcie not delivering the goods  for MAC users", "Author": "L.Duckitt", "ReviewID": "R2KAAZKQOT0T04", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I desperately wanted to give this product 5 stars but at last it just did not deliver on the most fundamental of levels and that is to chance settings. lets start from the beginning. The camera is small and well made instructions delivers the basic needed information but if you have a Mac you are in trouble, you will only be able to access the most basic of settings, actually you will be able to do a firmware upgrade and that is it. Want to access your video clips GOOD LUCk, you will have to go into the sd card itself and find it there, want to switch off the camera sounds (and believe me it gets annoying fast) there is no way of doing it, the instructions says go to the desktop manager to do this but if you have a mac you not going to find a place to manage settings. So yes if you have a windows computer you can fine tune your camera if you have a mac Looxcie takes you back to the 80's when Mac was the step child of computer systems. So sorry Looxcie but I am disappointed in a product with great potential but which is not delivering on the finer detail of customer support and I am kind should give you one star for thatSo improving my rating Looxcie  finally figured out where to turn of the camera sounds, what does that say I am stupid or the software interface just need a little bit of work so I will go with need a little bit of work :)", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay product, horrible shipping", "Author": "Stanley Cook", "ReviewID": "R2MY0LAVDRFEV4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was one of those products that was to get here by Christmas.
