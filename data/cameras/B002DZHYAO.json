But the pictures are not terrible. There aren't a lot of extra features, but for my 8 1/2 year old, it was perfect. One drawback- no audio with video. That would be my only complaint. Good for the kids to begin on definitely", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1VAW8CIHTGR5X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I expected a cheap limited camera when I purchased this for my 8 year old daughter. I didn't expect the picture quality to be terrible. Even still pictures in good lighting come out very poorly. This camera would teach my daughter to hate taking pictures. It is going back immediately. I'll replace it with a Nikon Coolpix and pay an additional $30 for something that offers 100x better quality.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very poor choice, even for a cheap camera", "Author": "Jennifer Robertson", "ReviewID": "R3VXJDSPT65N3V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after my other was chewed up by a dog.  I was looking for something that didn't have a lot of special features but took decent quality photos.  I was greatly underwhelmed.  Picture quality was crap.  With all the settings on auto, it would take 5-7 seconds for the color to normalize before I could take the shot.  If I took one before it did, the color would come out extremely orangey.  Even if I waited to get the color decent, if one item moved in the shot or I moved the camera even slightly, the entire picture would come out blurry/unrecognizable.  If you specifically selected all of the settings, some of the pictures would turn out better, but you had to go back through and reset the settings every time you turned the camera on.  Even with flash, the photos taken in darker lighting were grainy, discolored, and out of focus.  Whenever I zoomed in to an object, the photo got worse in quality (which is saying something).  The only way you could tell what the photo was is if you were the one who took it and knew what it was supposed to be.  Then, to top it all off, the camera quit working in less than a year.  I would push the power button and it would start to turn on, but as soon as I let the pressure off the button, it out automatically power off.  I managed to get a few pictures by taking the photo while holding down the power button, but that was very difficult to manage and the pictures weren't worth it anyway.  I didn't even bother trying to return it as it was a rather cheap purchase to begin with.  All I can say is that I will never buy another Vivitar item and I advise everyone I know against them.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Waste of money", "Author": "Dr Phill", "ReviewID": "R76348S8K17DQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very poor quality pictures, not easy to handle.

I have been dealing with the company via e-mail for almost 2 months now, and they said stupid crap like \"try removing the batteries to reset it\" and loads of other non helpful information. They have dragged this out with one pointless e-mail after another, then finally asked if I have the receipt still in the 2nd to last email, of course I don't almost 2 months later, but I told them I used a store saving card so there would be a record of the transaction. 2 weeks later they replied with \"what day was the purchase made. I replied \"I have no idea between 3-5 days before X-mas, and again the store will have a record of the purchase in their data base due to me using the stores savings card (aka track your purchases card)\". I have not received a reply in over 3 weeks, and know they were just dragging it out as long as possible for me to give up. WORST digital camera ever, even WORSE company ever spend extra and buy from a known company.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Vivitar Vivicam 5024 5.1MP Digital Camera, 8x Digital Zoom, 2.4\" Screen, SD Card - Pink", "Name": "Vivitar Vivicam 5024 5.1MP Digital Camera, 8x Digital Zoom, 2.4 Screen, SD Card - Pink", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-x7o%2Bn8ML._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002DZHYAO"}}
