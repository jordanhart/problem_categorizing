Great quality with long distance shots. I'm still working on moving subjects in low light conditions. I do not like the \"low light\" mode, as the ISO seems to be set real high and the result is grainy. I'm using either manual or program modes. Still the best non-SLR that I've had.I just got this camera and love it. For me, it has all of the advanced features found in much more expensive DSLR cameras, but without the price. The optical zoom is wonderful to have instead of having to worry about carrying around various lenses for larger cameras. It is not a pocket camera, nor would I recommend it for beginners, as there are a lot of features that would not be useful for them. The size of the camera is perfect for me. The flash has to be manually opened up, which I love because I don't have to fiddle around with making sure that the flash icon says what I want it to say...The flash is on or off, that simple.It has all the scene selections that the smaller Canon cameras have, but it has a lot more. There's modes that are mostly found on DSLR cameras on this: P (Program); TV (Shutter Speed Priority); AV (Aperture Priority), Manual, Auto, \"LIVE\" and a nice collection of fun shooting modes that Canon has. (miniature mode, fisheye, discreet, fireworks, low light, snow etc). There is also a record button on the camera so you don't have to switch the dial to video mode to start recording.There is also an actual lens cap on this camera. I like that because I have had three other small Canon cameras have the auto lens cover break or get stuck and cause all sorts of trouble.If you want a more advanced camera, but don't want the $500+ price tag, I think this is a very good choice.I really do not recommend getting this if it's going to be a beginner camera.I don't ever use auto mode because I have never gotten good results out of it. I like being able to select what mode I want based on the conditions.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a great step up from my SX200IS", "Author": "Mickey \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R2RD79YQM9OWXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't understand the other reviews, really? Are you people serious?!I LOVE this camera, when I first saw it was \"to be released\" I started getting exited, I need this camera, the zoom was (is) perfect, the price, eh, not outta sight. Finally the day came, It was available to order, I ordered, waiting, patiently for it to arrive in time for our Disneyland vacation. It arrived. I was sceptical, bigger that I was used to, smaller than I expected, would it live up to my 200? ... Then the I took some test shots, garden pics, they looked beautiful!! So we were off to vacation, I took many, many pictures, day, night, motions, stills, portrait, landscapes, flowers, characters, all looked good but only able to see them on the camera. When I got home, I plugged the camera into my 55\" HD tv via the hdmi cable, started the slide show.....The moment of truth! Did I get my monies worth? Risking a $4000.00 vacation photo shoot of hundreds of pictures of my kids, the park, capturing the actual \"essence\" of our grand vacation on a $329.00 camera?I DID!!!Breath-taking 16 mega pixel pictures adorned my 16:9 Full HD 1080p resolution panel (1920 x 1080) TV screen, flawless, gorgeous, vivid colors, absolutely stunning!!I was thrilled, all the photos in 16:9 format.  I couldn't get enough!! I was the most excited of all the family members, \"look, you can see so much detail...\" I was beaming!!

I was looking for something smaller to carry around besides my big DSLR Camera and lenses. So I gave this camera a try and I was surprised at how small it was when I received it. The camera seemed well built and the focusing was very quick!!!! The stabilization worked very well at long distances. My only downfall with this camera was the Iso Noise in pictures in low light. It was very evident when you get around iso 600. Even at iso 400 you could see noise. I expected better low light results from Canon since I'm a Canon fan and I shoot with Canon products. I've had other point and shoot cameras that performed better in low light situations. In contrast, pictures in full daylight with no flash needed were very good!I'm sure the ISO noise issues in low light was due to the fact that this camera used a CCD sensor and not a CMOS sensor. I decided to upgrade to the Canon sx50 model with a CMOS sensor and a 50x zoom. I couldn't be happier!!! The sx50 is an awesome camera and shoots greats pictures even in low light.Pros: Easy to use, excellent focusing system, small size, battery lifeCons: Iso Noise in low light", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Devin", "ReviewID": "R13XHMASF4V47D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for under $300.

Add to this that i am a nature photographer, primarily, and everything is quite dead and i will have to add to review as I take more photos. I will say that the camera works great with no glitches. It arrived exactly on the due date with everything intact and working well. The pictures I have taken have been perfect. I am someone who is considered a professional, and have a degree in photography and everyone expects someone like me to have a DSL-R; but because of a very serious auto accident I can not longer carry around a heavy bag full of lenses and extra equipment, so imagine my joy over finding cameras like this. After all, a true photographer knows framing and lighting and can take a good photo with any piece of equipment.I am excited to recieve my filters and extra lenses and to put this camera to its full uses at which time I will give a more in depth review. But this camera is light, easy to hold, the pictures are clear and I am able to make good sized 300 to 600dpi prints and products. I am amazed at the amount of vacation photographers with DSLR cameras who, lets be honest, dont really know what they are doing with them... and I agree with a previous reviewer that this is no camera for a beginner. But if you want to save alot of money, not lug a heavy bag of equipment around, miss shots changing lenses, and still come away with professional quality photos, so far this camera fits the bill. It's an advanced \"point and shoot\" so if you're a beginner, I would recommend a different camera.

I recently returned an Olympus DSLR camera because it was difficult to operate and the printed images were not that good. After some research I realized that what I really wanted was a point and shoot camera that was on the small side and easy to operate. Voila, this is it! I use the Auto setting right now but will try the manual settings too, although the Auto does exactly what I want it to. The camera is small but easy to handle and lightweight. Taking videos is also easy and the results are nice. The videos are clear with very natural coloring which is what I like my videos to look like. Images are also very natural looking.For someone who's not a professional photographer I see no reason to buy a DSLR when you can get a point and shoot that does such a good job. The 30 zoom and 16mp are more than enough for the casual photographer. The battery lasted through about 200 pictures and 3 short videos before I had to recharge it. I just purchased an extra battery to carry with me so I don't lose any important pictures due to the battery running out. The camera did come with a lens cover that stays attached to the camera with a wire to prevent loss. I was pleasantly surprised to see this because it didn't say a lens cover was included with this camera.

I am not a photographer, but I do love to take pictures. I started out with my iPhone and a Sony point and shoot. I realised I love taking pictures. So I did a lot of research this camera stood out. There is mixed reviews, but I continued to look at best buy, Walmart and amazon. The majority was anywhere from 4-5 stars all across the board. I even watched YouTube. So I decided for the price and just starting out I would give it a shot. Amazon sent it out and I began to use it. I have to say I love it, pictures are clear, movies are amazing.  I began to take pictures at the lake, nature and my dog. Came out great. I know most are saying that the camera is not good for action shots and Lowe light, if you play around with the settings it's much better. It's not a fast camera but again you can play around with that setting as well. What I found to help me is that I ordered books like canon power shot digital photography and digital photography for beginners. They have helped with the understanding of this camera.  This camera is small and compact, and it does a little of everything . It's great for me for just starting out and not mention I have has three back surgeries and unable to lug all that equipment around.  Overall this is great camera small easy to use, great pictures and a lot of fun. Like I said I am no photographer by doing a little research you can have a wonder camera.

I was wrong, I returned that camera, purchased this one and glad I did. My whole reason for upgrading my camera (I had a Canon SX210 which is an excellent camera) was to get a better zoom. The 30X zoom is fantastic but needs the 16 megapixels to make crisp, clear pictures when you crop them. The camera I returned only had 12 megapixels and the pictures taken with the zoom were blurry when cropped. The camera body is bigger than the SX210, easy to hold and the buttons easy to use for people that have hand problems. The lag time is minimal between shots and has the picture burst feature that gets you great action series shots (tried it out on taking pictures of my dog catching her Frisbee). The camera takes great pictures in low and artificial light, this is another reason I wanted this camera. I don't video a lot so I cannot review that feature of this camera.

Well, it does, but it's not fast. You can take a picture approximately every 2 seconds. I have a 4 year old Powershot SX10 and it can take up to 6 frames per second, and even my husband's sub-$100 Canon Elph can take around 4 frames per second!Waiting so long between photos is unacceptable if you're trying to take pictures of wild birds! I'm lucky to get ONE picture of a bird with the SX500 before it bounces around or flies away, instead of 10 or 11 with my SX10. I have missed out on a lot of shots, which is unfortunate because the 30x zoom really is great! If you like to take rapid-fire pictures of anything (wildlife, kids, pets, sports) then this is NOT the camera for you!My other gripe is with the focus when the zoom is fully extended. I'm impressed at how steady the camera is (the image stabilization really works!) but it seems like the camera has trouble locking focus at full telephoto. I have missed out on nice shots because of this issue as well.Overall picture quality is great. It's a Canon, they're all high-quality. The camera is small, lightweight, and portable. It's fun to use and I really, really wish it didn't have that unfortunate lag. I'm going to buy the SX50 instead. A little larger, a little pricier, but it's worth it if I don't have to miss out on any more great bird photos.Bottom line - don't get this camera if you need to take quick continuous photos.

I was very surprised to find that the PowerShot (and I'm guessing other point & shoots) are so much more complicated to use than the DSL's.Pro's: Price is right, it's light and compact and easy to carry around, additional batteries are reasonable (15$ for 2), it has fun features that take the place of specialty lenses, and when you get a good shot, it's a really good shot.Con's: It can be difficult to get it to focus where you want it to focus, many times it tells you subject is in focus and it's not, features don't always work when telephoto is engaged and the battery has a short lifespan (90 minutes and/or about 200 photos. however the batteries are small and cheap enough that it's easy to have extra available to switch out.)I'm still playing around with the different shooting modes and hopefully will get in sync with it for consistently good shots. The advanced user manual is okay...but it must be for several cameras because it tells me to go to things on the menu that I don't have icons for on my camera. It has been helpful though.Update: I've found shooting in \"Live\" mode, all the features work and am getting much more consistant quality. Equal to what I get with my DSL.

Portable, inexpensive, yet with a high optical zoom and good image stability.  There are undoubtedly other models with better features that take higher quality pictures, including Canon's own SX50, but none for under $200 that I could find.  Checking on reviews at various sites also led me to believe the SX500 IS was at least comparable, and usually better than the other 30x \"ultra\" zoom cameras.After playing around with it a few days, mostly on the Auto setting, I'm very happy with the optical zoom and the image stability you get at 30x, better than I got with the Lumix at 10x.  Macro shots at an inch or less look great, at least in good light.  Low light shots get very grainy as the ISO kicks up to 800 very quickly so I'll be playing with the manual settings more there.  Tons of those settings that I'll have to really study--as another review pointed out, this isn't a beginner's camera, but then I didn't want one and am willing to dive into the details a bit.Possible cons: movies are \"only\" at 720, but look plenty good (for 1080, maybe consider the SX50?).  The aperture speed was rated low for this camera at just under 1 sec.  Haven't taken any high speed shots yet, say a bird in flight, so I can't comment on it yet.  The battery life is also supposedly short, but I always get a spare (2 for $15).  My maybe biggest gripe is the awkward shape, which is to say the lens is very long, so the camera is very boxy.  I don't want to get yet another dedicated camera bag, and it doesn't fit into any of my laptop backpacks or satchels very well.  It's not a big camera, it's just not very flat in any 2 dimensions, so just... awkward.All in all, this was a fantastic value, and hopefully a gateway into better photography.  I'll update this review after delving more into the finer points of the camera.Update (9/3/2013): I see the price has gone up past $250, and the \"super zooms\" have gone to 50X.  Having done some sports stadium shooting from the back fence to full zoom on the field, I can capture closeups of plays, even fastballs leaving the pitcher's hand from 200-300ft away, so I'm more than happy with 30X, and the stability is very impressive, at least in full daylight (perfect conditions).  Still need to test at, say, nighttime concerts, but I still think this is an excellent value, even in the $250 range, and a steal for under $200.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great  for normal pictures also MUST buy an SD memory card to use", "Author": "r.drew", "ReviewID": "R1RLJSIOXTBOTZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The PowerShot is great for normal shooting but for real distance you definitely need a tripod. For stills the photos are very sharp and clean but if you try and take advantage of the 30X zoom or anywhere close to 30x the camera becomes vey sensitive to movement. This is not a camera for taking shoots of things that are even slightly moving. That being said we shoot pictures of wildlife that live in the wetlands behind our house and with the use of the 30x zoom and a tripod we've gotten some amazing shoots. Sometimes it takes 4 or 5 shots to get a good one but it's worth it. The regular still shots using some telephoto to crop come out amazing. The PowerShot uses a special rechargeable batteries so I also bought a couple of spare batteries (they are not very expensive) and keep them charged in the camera bag. One last thing.

All of this would not be an issue if the memory card was accessible from outside the battery compartment. If you use a tripod and have the mount on the camera bottom it blocks access to the battery door.

First of all, if you're such a purist, you shouldn't even be looking in this price range.  Move up to the Rebel 70D, and don't try to impress the masses with your higher than average expectations not being met by a camera that costs less than the lens of a Rebel 70D.  That being said, you will get satisfactory pictures, if you are a being a tourist, attending a party, or out with the family.  This isn't a camera that will photograph a still hummingbird, and it will not give you good, large format, poster-quality pictures either.  First of all, it adds lots of fake color pixels, which become visible once you zoom in to your pictures on your computer.  The quality of the image is also not the best, as the images can look rather grainy when you expand them to their correct size on your screen.  What do you get then?  Well, you get beautiful 5x7 album pictures, and you might even get a decent 11x17 small poster.  Beyond that, you should not consider this camera as an option.  If you're going to a hockey game, you might also want to steer clear from this camera.  Especially in auto mode, the camera takes up to three full seconds to focus and shoot a picture.  Even in TV mode where you are supposedly in control of the shutter speed, it is very slow to react.  This is not the best camera for a sporting event, that's for sure.  Also, make sure you purchase a memory card, as the camera does not have one included.  The camera will perform very well in low light conditions, and it has a very decent zoom for a camera this small.  Speaking of small, this camera will not fit in your pockets.  But it is small enough that it didn't bother me to carry it on my hand.Overall I give the camera a 4 star rating, mostly because in its native image mode of 4608x3456 pixels, the images appear slightly blurred.  That's because the actual resolution of this camera is rather low, 180 dots-per-inch.  For the kind of money you'll be spending, you will be able to keep beautiful, natural-colored, and vivid album pictures.

You would think that this canon sx500 would perform better and not worst than the little tiny cameras out there since it's so much bigger and has a great lens. I have tried both the auto mode and the manual modes, but the color, contrast and sharpness of the pictures were not at all what you'd expect. The price was amazing $199 at Best Buy this week, unfortunately I will return it and buy one of those little cameras again, at least they won't take as much space in my purse/pocket.

The box looked like it had already been open but all the contents in the box were there.The camera: I have more pros than cons about this camera. My pros were that it was a very nice, simple using camera. The instructions are nice and easy to follow. The camera makes good video. This is where the cons come in. I'm not sure if it's the lighting in my house, but when I'm in my house the camera quality is bad. I took my camera outside and noticed it's 100x better outside. When making a video, the sound could be better. I feel like the microphone on the camera is in a weird spot and is very hard to pick sound up on. Another thing that kind of made me mad is that I paid $200 for this camera and it didn't even come with a memory card. So be warned, you're going to pay more if you buy this camera for a memory card.Overall: This camera would be great for any event, the video is great, and I am pretty happy with this camera.

This makes for at least a fabulous vacation camera, and a bit more.  The negatives include what you have to expect: the trade offs for size and price necessitate a slow (small aperature) lens.  This means the flash range is limited, and the automatic controls tend to select a higher ASA.  I haven't figured out how to lock the ASA at 100 or 200.  Except in bright sunlight, a tripod is essential at the longer focal lengths.  Shutting off the image stabilization is recommended by the manufacturer when using a tripod.  There is no remote shutter release, so to avoid camera shake using a tripod, the self-timer is recommended.  This, coupled withe the shutter delay in normal operation means some difficulty in composing shots with moving objects.That said, overall it is a great camera at a great price.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "review of canon camera", "Author": "erin p kelley", "ReviewID": "RR5GWZ163Y2OF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera is great! it's smaller than i expected, but it's actually been a good thing for me. the screen is large. the focus on the screen is not always what you get with the real picture. it's so much better. it's easy to use and i like the application that gives you hints and tips as to how to focus, if to use the flash, etc. i love using this camera!", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Macro Zoom??", "Author": "R.

It was to upgrade my Canon IS3000 with a mere 5x zoom.  I also own a Sony camcorder with 70x zoom.  So far what ever I seem to do with the Canon SX 500 it is running circles around my Sony Camcorder.  My conclution now is that Sony does NOT make very good cameras.  The ZOOM on the SX 500 is absolutely fantastic.  Nice and smooth both in Still and Movie mode and the clarity is absolutely fantastic at 30x.  The only distortion really might be from my jumping up and down because the view is so good, because my Sony doesnt even come close to looking this good at ANY ZOOM LENGTH.... lol..  still pictures are crisp and a joy to look at on this sharp three inch screen.  Its easy to use but the only thing is make sure when your in the AUTO MODE the tracking automatically turns on... and the green box goes all over the screen to look for something to shoot at and while it does that it shuffles through all the mode choices... at first I thought it was a defect until I realized I HAD TO SET THE BOX AT THE AREA I WANTED TO SHOOT AT.... and you do that by pushing the top arrow button to select the shot...but I like the program mode the best... lets see... whats bad about it... well it is a lil bulky not bad, but requires a case.  And the neck strap is lame, it gets in the way of all your hands and the screen... I took it off am going to buy a hand strap here at Amazon and I DONT LIKE LENS COVERS, I like the ones that close automatically, but oh well...  I suggest buying an extra battery with maybe a car charger, because this camera because of its technology is going to use up more battery life probley than just the 190 pictures a charge they say you can get with this.

I purchased this camera for those reasons on Black Friday of last year and finally got to put it to the test a few days ago.I was highly impressed with the results. In fact for a bit, I think I was more excited by the pictures my camera was taking then the actual concert I attended. I won't lie...some were blurry and the camera had trouble focusing at times but that's to be expected when you have constantly changing lighting and the artist is moving and dancing around. I still am very pleased with the amount of pictures that did turn out crisp and beautiful. We had stadium seats very high up, you would never know it though from the pictures.

Because I have the waterproof case for the 110, I used it whenever I was shooting in wet areas and also for underwater shots. I used the SX500 in dry locations. In some instances, I was able to take comparable shots with both cameras and the difference was really striking. Let me preface this by saying that I'm NOT a photographer. I'm just someone who likes to take a lot of pictures. I like them to come out well, but I know virtually nothing about photography beyond what I've learned through trial and error.I found the low-light shots taken with the SX500 to be FAR superior than those taken with the Elph. Yes, it's difficult to capture a moving subject in low light. This isn't and expensive, professional camera. I'm very pleased with the results considering the price I paid.The biggest selling feature was the zoom lens. I was absolutely AMAZED how clear shots taken from VERY far away came out. I took this camera to Opening Day, to see the Red Sox players get their World Series rings. We didn't have the best of seats, so I had to really max out the zoom lens. I was certain the photos would be blurry. It's difficult to hold a camera really still, extremely zoomed in, while standing in a crowd. The photos were OUTSTANDING. I mean really...outstanding!I'm extremely pleased with this purchase. The camera is small and easy to carry with the strap around my neck. When I want something I can slip in my pocket, I opt for the Elph.I would classify this as a bridge camera. It's NOT as easy to carry around as a pocket-sized digital, but it's also not as cumbersome to carry around as a more professional model. It's EASY to use...even for novices like me!

The Canon Powershot Sx500 is in my opinion the best, most affordable camera there is. I have been nothing but impressed. The quality of the shots are top notch they are comparable to pictures you would take with a $2000 camera. The camera is so easy to use and the manual does an amazing job of answering any additional questions you have. The large viewing screen is amazing, it really helps you see the details. The zoom is unbeatable, when I was at target yesterday I tested this camera against the Fujifilm Finepix S4200, I zoomed them both in to 30x, and the results were mind-blowing. The picture taken by the Sx500 was crystal clear, not one part of the picture was even a hair blurry. The S4200 on the other hand, was awful. I stood there for 3 minutes trying to focus it and when I finally got it so it was semi blurry, I took the picture, the picture was so blurry I could not even make out the apple symbol. It was terrible. Please save yourself and buy the Canon Powershot Sx500!

So, when we were traveling, it worked well since pretty much all my shots were still shots, scenery, etc.  But, since returning from our trip, I've been using it at home for the kids activities such as when my sons are scootering or recently when we went to the indoor go-kart place.  All the action shots are fuzzy!  I can't seem to capture an action shot.  It's quite possible, even likely, that it's my inexperience but I need to do some research to see how this issue can be resolved.  So, until then, I give it 3-stars.  If I find some way to take good action shots, then I'll upgrade the rating. I used to have the old (pre-digital) Canon Rebel RX camera which was a wonderful camera and which is why I trust Canon.

I had a Canon Powershot S2 IS, until it's sensor cover started sticking and it doesn't function every other shot.  Cost as much to replace as to repair so here I am.First:  Auto setting?  Um, when I zoomed with the S2 I could focus immediately.  The SX500 I received is going right back to original focus with or without the flash.  I understand from info I'm finding on line that this is an IS issue.  I don't use a tripod to get pics of my pets.  I usually don't have time or room to set one up before the scene changes.  Auto setting gets a thumbs down.Looking at the settings dial I miss the infinity focus.  I miss the scene settings that auto adjust for indoor or snow pics.  Fisheye is novel but not enough to get a spot here.  Where's black and white?  I'm really going to miss the articulating LCD screen.  Don't miss the little view finder since I didn't use the S2's view finder.  That's one feature I really like, that the view finder is not wasting space and weighting down the camera.  Oh, and it fits so nicely in my hand.  I miss the weight but can get used to this.  I miss using AA batteries.  I was feeding my S2 after every 10-20 shots in the end but it was the convenience of a pre-charged power source available anywhere that I wanted.  I remember my camcorder and it's battery pack!One pic:  The one shot I did keep on the card I had on hand was a pic of a calculator from 2 feet away.  It focused acceptably and I could zoom in on the saved pic and read the buttons.  I'll have to see if it looks amazing on my computer after I download it.  Haven't done anything with the software yet and don't really plan to unless I have to.  I didn't use the S2's software either.Ok, on the battery pack:  The little bugger only took about an hour and a half to charge!  Nice.  I can live with that.  Hope the extras work as well.  No idea how long it will last just yet.  I plan to give the zoom a workout so I should be able to tell pretty soon.
