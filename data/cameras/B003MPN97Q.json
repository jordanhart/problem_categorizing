{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unique mix of quality and convenience", "Author": "Busy Executive", "ReviewID": "RKZ0PR06A0M6U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Sony Alpha NEX 5 as a gift for someone with lots of artistic ability, but who is intimidated by the typical DSLR. So far, it seems like a good choice.For me, there were four possibilities:- The Sony NEX 5- Olympus E-PL1- Panasonic GF1- Leica X1 (I'm a \"red dot\" softie)In retrospect, I wish I had spent more time thinking about a small DSLR, such as the Nikon D3100. The price difference isn't too great, and it would have opened up the door to a more versatile collection of lenses and accessories. The NEX 5 is about the most compact of any of the above though, so perhaps the size versus quality trade-off will come in handy. The NEX 5 body is about 10 ounces - half the weight of most of the others (although it gets closer when you compare camera plus lens).In terms of construction quality, I found the Sony to be very solid and well made, even though it's more compact than its peers. The body is a mix of magnesium alloy and plastic parts, and it feels rugged and comfortable in my hands. To be clear though, the Sony lenses seem quite a bit larger than the competition, and the combination of a small body plus enormous lens can look quite weird till you get used to it.Most of the camera's functions are only accessible through an extensive menu system. I use Nikon's DSLRs, but was able to adjust to the Sony menus pretty quickly. Still, I think the camera might have benefited from a few more user-assignable buttons that let you keep commonly used functions closer than wading through the menus. Otherwise, I found the operation pretty straightforward. The screen is large and easy to read, even in daylight. There are a lot of built-in tips to guide you through the more complex or seldom-used features...another plus.Speaking of lenses, Sony has the typical fixed 16mm wide-angle and an 18-55 zoom, with a 18-200 zoom supposedly coming soon. To their credit, Sony also makes an adapter that lets you use their DSLR lenses on the NEX 5, although you lose autofocus this way. To me, this is a big plus, even without autofocus. I found the images created by the 16mm to be quite good, but the 18-55 seems a little soft in the edges. It's also a slow f/6.3 at 55mm, which makes it a challenge to use in dark locations. Also, because Sony is using a bigger sensor, the 16mm seems quite a bit wider (it's like a 24mm in 35mm film camera equivalents) - great for landscapes, no so great for portraits.As for image quality, the Sony uses a full APS-C size sensor - the same one they use in their larger DSLRs - so it has an advantage over micro four-thirds and any point-and-shoot, especially at high ISO in low light. I found the photos to be about what you'd expect from any modern camera: sharp, contrasty, vivid colors and so on. More to the point, they're about the best you can get without breaking out a high-end DSLR and pro-grade lenses, or breaking the bank on something like the Leica M9.The NEX5 also has extensive video capabilities, and seems to be one of the few that can zoom, adjust exposure and so on while taking a video. I don't use video much so I won't comment further other than to say that it seems well implemented, easy to use and it produces very high quality results.Sony also bundles in all their usual wizardry, including their panorama and built-in HDR (High Dynamic Range) capabilities. You can do most of this in the computer after the shoot, but it's nice to also have this stuff in the camera to get a sense of how it might look. The NEX comes with a built-in flash that you can remove if you want to keep the weight down as low as possible. It's not the most powerful, but it's nice that Sony includes it with the camera rather than making it an add-on.In conclusion, I like the Sony a lot...it's small, easy to use and takes about the best pictures I've seen for a total system weight under two pounds. My only gripe would be the relatively limited range of lenses and accessories available for it, but as a second camera for casual or travel use, it probably deserves a place in the bag.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "the NEX-5 is the NEXT great camera", "Author": "Uncle \"Trav\"", "ReviewID": "R12GJNBDI34IDD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK - I just love new gadgets and technology.  I had been using a D90 for nearly 2 years but upgraded to a D700 and use it for all of my heavy lifting photo shoots.  (what a great camera).  However, I wasn't using my D90 except on the rare occasion that I wanted to use two bodies on a shoot and used the D90 for my 70-300 lens for telephoto shots, giving me up to 450mm.  OK, I digress.I sold my D90 and bought the Sony NEX-5 (silver because I couldn't wait for the black one).  I just bought the 16mm lens and will wait until later this fall when I hear they are coming out with a 18-300 E-type.This is a really cool camera.  I basically keep it in my pocket almost all the time. It is pretty bulky in my pocket ever with the smaller 16mm lens (and protective lens & cap).  I know I have read some bad reviews about the menu system but it really only took me about 20 minutes to get used to it.The focus ring kind of reminded me of my Blackberry when I had one.It was a little slow to get used to not having a view finder but there is a great feature that you can use to help fine tune your focus (it only works with E type lends and not the A with adapter.  You basically can get it to auto focus and then lightly touch the focus ring and it ZOOMS in to help you FINE TUNE the focus.  If I knew how to upload some sample pics I would but trust me, the picture quality is great.  There are just too many other features for me to comment on but I highly recommend this camera form not just a step up for an amature but a pro wold use it just like I try to do.  I get a lot of great shots just because I have this camera buldging out of my pocket.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera at a great price!", "Author": "Karmacomposer", "ReviewID": "RDAP1S99NXM3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Nex5 hoping to do video and still photography, but needed the quality compareable to my Canon XH A1 pro video camera.  I was NOT disappointed with the Sony Nex5!  The image quality is superb.  It is fantastic in outside light and indoor light.  The fact that you can interchange lenses is a massive plus because my broadcast quality camera cannot do that.Funny thing is, I went to a photography store to look at lenses and they scoffed at the size of the camera not knowing it was a new product with very high specs.  After looking it up, they found out that almost every lens in the place could fit it with the adapter I bought - and they said the sensor was MASSIVE for a camera that small.The quality of video is unreal.  You have to see it to believe it.  I bought a 500MM lens, a zoom lens 60-300MM, a 135MM lens and the wide angle lens that came with the camera.  With those lenses, I have a pretty amazing video camera.  I also purchased the mic attachment and will be buying the viewfinder attachment.I took all kinds of video in daylight, at night and in various situations.  Because the camera can be fully manual, it allowed me to set my ISO small and make adjustments so low light looked clear and crisp - dark, but clear and crisp.  Don't set the ISO to high or you will get a lot of digital noise (gain) in your video.  Because it shoots in 1080p 60i, the quality is on par, if not better, than my broadcast quality video camera.  In fact, I could swear it is actually more clear and higher quality.  Simply astounding.The picture quality is superb - 14MP is pretty big, so your images look great and can be used for full page spreads in magazines!  At the same time, the lenses allow me to achieve everything from up close macro shots to shooting a player's face from the stands at a ball game.The screen is gorgeous and tilts.  It IS hard to see in direct sunlight, so the option viewfinder is nice for photography.  For video, it's a bit tough, but doable.  I wish there was a sun shade for it.  The focus feature is great - the camera will zoom way in on a subject so you can properly focus.  It works very well, though I am used to focusing using a viewfinder, so once I have the optional one, my shots and video will be perfect.In a nutshell, you get Sony quality in a small package, but with big results.  I have no regrets buying this camera and know I will get great images and video from it.

Politano", "ReviewID": "R39HHOI216V4SO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Sony NEX is the first item I have ever purchased with a remove-to-charge battery and no spare.  Day one and I have to chose between an overly priced sony and a knock off battery which reviews say is 1 mm to short to work properly.  The Maximal Power DB SON NP-FW50 Replacement Battery for NEX-3, Alpha NEX-5, Sony a33 DSLR, Sony a55 DSLR 1150mah Battery works very well.The NEX is very small.  I now have it in silver, but still prefer an entirely black camera.  The lens, however, only comes in silver.Focus:  The Olympus Evolt E520 10MP Digital SLR Camera with Image Stabilization w/ 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens is a horrible focuser.  I had to purchase a focus shutter which requires me to use the veiw finder.  The Sony NEX focuses very well (especially in spot mode.  Place the spot where you would like to focus then depress the button half way until focus complete.  Then align the camera before pressing the shutter all the way).  The manual focus on the Sony is also easy to use.  The Olympus e510 is much better at removing camera shake then the Sony NEX5 which is very sensitive to camera shake.Ease of use:  I spent many days reading and remaking a reference manual so that I could use the Olympus.  The Sony is much easier to learn to use.  Many buttons are replaced by a huge menu system.  Menu navigation techniques areNot universal and the wheel doesNot always roll the menus properly.  If the arrow keys canBe used, they are much better.Understanding what to do:  The NEX uses educated symbols like f and A, but also uses simple symbols like a man moving fast and a man standing still.  There are often many disabled options/subOptions in the menu system and the on board help doesNot explain why.  For example:  Without the web, I wouldHave never guessed that Auto HDR was disabled because RAW was enabled.Panorama:  Indoor panorama with the NEX is a REAL PROBLEM.  The Olympus takes panorama pictures with a special memory card and a special picture stitcher on an external computer.  The system worked well, but I would rather the camera do it so that I can see if I got a good picture right away.  This is why I chose the NEX5.  This is why I reduced the rating to 3.  While the NEX is in panorama mode, you canNot adjust the camera settings.  Unless you are outdoors on a bright sunny day, you are in the dark.  I contacted Sony regarding the problem.  They made a repair ticket for me.  I sent the camera back to Amazon and purchased a new one.  The new one is better, but still a major problem.  I am now in the process of research.  First a firmware update is necessary.  Evidently the lens makes a big difference.  Lots of bad reports involving the 2.8/16 lens in panorama mode.Flash:  The flash is nice because it is easy to flip up and down (turn on and shut off).  It is, however, low and I ground the Pro Digital Hard Lens Hood For The Sony Alpha NEX-5, NEX-3 Digital Camera Which Have The Sony E Series (16mm, 18-55mm) Lens to avoid a shadow from the flash.  Manual focus is difficult when the flash is down, but it is easy enough to flip back down.  The Olympus e510 flash is better because it distributes the light much more evenly.  The NEX5 flash places a bright spot in the middle of the picture.  Fortunately, the NEX5 takes good pictures without a flash or I wouldBe purchasing another flash.Picture Quality:  If you have an 8 megaPixel camera and you would like to double the resolution up and down, you would have to purchase a 32MegaPixel camera.  A high megaPixel count is impressive, but I doNot concern myself with a megaPixel here or there.  My brother purchased a Canon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens.  The Canon uses software which helps a picture taken with a higher ISO.  ISO verses picture quality shows a great reduction at 1200.  Examination of ISOs higher than 1600 are better on the Canon.  Pictures taken at ISOs lower than 1600 seem the same for both.  However, pictures taken at 1600 ISO are better on the NEX than the Canon.  Also, it seems that normal indoor lighting without a flash will use ISO 1600.  Greater ISOs means you are taking a picture in the dark without a flash.  If this is your desire, you might prefer Canon.Lens:  The lens is really good.  I have no lighting problems unless in Panorama mode.  The lens requires a lens adapter to use the lens accessories I purchased.  The lens accessories I purchased for the Olympus went right on.  There is no reason for a manufacturer to define their own copyright on the outer side of the lens.  It is annoying with no benefit.Summary:  I find the camera very interesting.  Excluding panorama, where many needed options are disabled, the NEX can make a very good picture from gross conditions.  I am impressed with Auto HDR which makes a good indoor picture while a bright window is in the background (but hold that camera very still).  Auto HDR stores 2 pictures.  I usually like the normal picture when the lighting is correct and the combined picture when it isNot (unless I shook the camera).", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "poor zoom implementation; nice other features.", "Author": "Brook Norton", "ReviewID": "R32T2DD47VJ3OL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a pocket point-and-shoot and wanted to upgrade. My wife and I use zoom on about half our shots. I saw the NEX-5 (with pancake lens) had digital zoom and realize you loose resolution when you digitally zoom. But I figured I'd get much better shots (than my point-and-shoot) when not zooming and shots about equal to my point-and-shoot when I used full digital zoom. But when I tried out the NEX-5, there is no dedicated zoom control - you have to dig down a menu to zoom - not really usable for real-time zoom decisions. Further, the video does not shoot with digital zoom, and I use zoom all the time when I shoot video. So having just a pancake lens is a real step back from my point-and-shoot. To me, this is a serious performance draw back sure to disappoint customers who didn't realize this when they \"upgraded\". So I returned it and have ordered the NEX-5 with the zoom lens. Now it will be too large to take with me everywhere and will need to just keeping using my point-and-shoot for various occasions where I am active.I would not have re-orderd with the \"right\" lens unless I liked a lot about the rest of the camera. A mode to show clearly parts of the photo in bright light AND shadow (works very nicely). There is a panorama mode (great for upcoming trip to Greece) but no paranormal mode. Great low-light performance and many other valuable features. I imagine the NEX-5 with 18-55mm zoom lens will get four stars (too bulky for five).Other nits: cheap shoulder strap is included; I bought a new one. Nothing to hold the lens cap after you remove it. I bought a lens cap leash. Initial tests went through the battery quickly - will need to use a while in real life for a firm conclusion. Even with the zoom lens on, I only get 3x (optical) zoom and the digital zoom will be effectively unavailable real time (deep in a menu), as opposed to my point and shoot that does optical zoom as far as it can (3x) then auotmatically adds digital zoom for a total 10x zoom.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "A very expensive doorstop", "Author": "M.
