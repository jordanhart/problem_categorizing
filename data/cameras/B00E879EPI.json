{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantanstic small camera", "Author": "James A. Fillmore", "ReviewID": "R2BRY81RF47SBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was reviewing cameras to see if I should replace my full-sized DSLR with one of the latest flavors, but found this camera and discovered it has really cool features. (a) built-in time lapse mode. You can program how fast and how long to shoot a time-lapse sequence, and it builds a video sequence from it. (b) high speed (slow motion) video mode. For smaller frame sizes, it will record faster frame rates, so when it plays back at standard rate you get \"slow motion video\".  (c) The \"BEST SHOT\" modes. Besides helping newbies with concepts such has depth-of-field or fast shutter rates, which you can do with any camera in manual mode, this camera has artistic modes to boost dynamic range, contrast, and colors. Also a mode to make sure that group shots come out good by taking multiple frames and combining the best face shots.In Summary, this camera has lots of image processing programming going on in the camera at the time of the shoot, so you don't have to do it later. At a relative low cost, I think this is an additional camera many serious photographers would want to have.Hint to buyers: Since it seems to only ship out of Japan, download the ENGLISH operators manual first, so you can convert the menu's from Japanese to English, then you are ready to go!", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$263.00", "Features": "In the scenes such as at the time of backlight and a night view, zoom photography hard to please, a camera automatically carries out high-speed consecutive copying composition depending on the situation.", "Name": "Casio EXILIM Digital Camera 16MP Black EX-ZR800BK", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U5cnx7ZBL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E879EPI"}}
