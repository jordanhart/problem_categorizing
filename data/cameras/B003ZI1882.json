Only caution is that night range in my experience is probably more like about 25 to 30 feet of usable range which is still better than some other cameras I have tried but not quite as much as I had expected.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked ok for 3 months", "Author": "YA Book Reader \"YA Book reader\"", "ReviewID": "RV5XROJFA7KCK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For 3 months they worked ok, nothing that great but for the price ok.

My husband installed them and even though it was a lot of work to run all the wiring, it was well worth it. We put three cameras outdoors and one indoors(hidden inconspicuously next to something decorative because the cameras are a bit large) and they work. We hooked it up to view them on our TV, computer and iphone. I think we can only view on two of the three devices at a time, for example, TV and iphone or TV and PC, nevertheless, it works great. I can view from my iphone at any time and check on my teenaged child when home from school. Yes my child knows the camera is there, this is for security and peace of mind, not indoors spying:) But the passwords and operation of the cameras are strictly for me and my husband. The night vision view is a bit grainy but still good enough to see everything going on. Otherwise, indoors or during daylight outside, the view is awesome. With more than one dvr you can install even more cameras. The only downfall is that we can't pan or zoom, but these cameras work for our needs so it was not a deal breaker for us. If you are looking for those additional features, the cameras will be more expensive. I think this is a good purchase and I would highly recommend.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "good for the price", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R175CVLBN5H2BP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had these up and running for a week now and so far they are working nicely. Only problem is they don't show colors properly regardless of the settings. Dark colors appear light, ie black is pinkish on mine. Also something i didn't see posted anywhere is that the IR LED'S on these cameras glow red at night, I like that because people will see that you have them even in the dark. The mounts are good quality in my opinion.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "night owl cams", "Author": "tony", "ReviewID": "R1QC8G7X225OWV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "they are not as good as the ones we have. they are not very clear for night time. wish I would have checked around a little more.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "night owl", "Author": "hillbillygoat", "ReviewID": "R1DXAYZ9OCIGNB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "They work great.

No problem with camera's picture quality at all. Daylight images are great for the price. Night vision works as advertised and works even better if there is a structure in the viewing field of the camera. The LEDS will reflect the lighting to the target area. What made me select the Night Owl Security CM245 4-pack was the individual price per camera, which included a 60' BNC cord for each. The icing on the cake was Amazon's guarantee if the product was defective. I was however, very disappointed when I was ready to purchase another 4-pack and discovered the price dropped by twenty dollars.
