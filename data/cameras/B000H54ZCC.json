This happens even though they are indoors.2)Axis will not repair them, and will not sell you the image sensor.  They just tell you to get new cameras.3)About half of the cameras have died.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Camera but that night vision", "Author": "Paul Elvan Pierre \"Supernova\"", "ReviewID": "R237340DRT7TN6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Axis 212 is a good product, the picture quality is very good and it has great features. But the lack of night vision was a problem for me. It was easy to install on my network and simple to locate. I like that is has no moving parts.

The web interface works well with Firefox & IE.  It also works with Chrome, but the crosshair click action does not always work.  I was expecting to be able to get a larger higher quality image with the zoom, but you basically have a large fish-eye view which when zoomed is corrected to look flat, but beyond that you can't really get a fine detailed image.  It's also heavy and off-balance, which is ok for a wall or ceiling mount, but not so great for a tripod.  Not thrilled about the flimsy plastic cover.  All in all, Axis makes wonderful cameras and this one is another example.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lacks Email Functionality", "Author": "MagnaMan", "ReviewID": "R3FVBFIKAJ4XYK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's advertised as being able to send email \"snapshots\" to you. For example, if motion is detected, it snaps a picture and emails it to you. However you cannot use email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, MSN, etc. It is not compatible with the MAJORITY of all email providers. You have to either setup your own SMTP server or try to find one that supports relaying - a hard thing to find today.If you're a network engineer, setting this up should be no problem, but be warned otherwise.They claim a firmware update is coming to provide compatibility but this is little help to me now when I need it most and sunk a couple thousand dollars on these units only to figure this out after finishing installation... Very frustrating...Other than that the picture quality is good, for small rooms, its a bit \"fish eye\" lense looking.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "HookEmHorns", "ReviewID": "R386006CRKSP6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Installed this in a nursery and very pleased with the unit.

First thing I would have liked to see is an included vertical tilt mount instead of the horizontal angle mount.  I feel most people aren't trying to watch a hallway instead of watch a room.  This camera has a very wide fish eye lens that distorts slightly, but that is expected.  Gives you a great view of large spaces, but far away objects can get out of focus.  Focus is adjustable, but the fish eye lens is better for wide and short viewing.  Web interface is good, lots of customization and options.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "works well", "Author": "rt", "ReviewID": "R3VNG97J9B53MD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "worth the money.
