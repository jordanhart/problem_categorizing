Where do I start.  The manual appears to be a \"Chinglish\" translation.  Software is a house of cards that does collapse often.  For some reason the DVR \"resets\" all the camera, record and alarms settings to off or some other feature you did not choose.  You then spend hours wandering through menus trying to get back to where you started (back up your settings to USB!!), and ultimately you can never get it truly back to where it was.  You compromise and learn to live with your life when a \"feature\" you once had can no longer be turned on or off.  Case in point the DVR was set to trip its external alarm relay when the cameras detect motion.  Now for some reason it can't be turned back on.  Months have passed with me fiddling with it.  The most recent head scratcher is the clock feature, the time sometime sticks and then the cameras don't turn off after my preset 10 second record time, the GMT sync doesn't work and the clock is a day off, reset it and check it the next day and its stuck on the previous day.  When the clock does decide to actually give you the time, it just counts through 24 hours and starts over, no day change.  Oh yeah the E-mail alert feature worked for the first week now confounds me as to why it quit.The video quality?  Well I knew I wasn't going to get very good quality, I'm simply trying to catch the neighbors dogs crapping in my yard and look for when I get deliveries. For that I have to say its OK, and again, you get what you pay for.I bought this system because it had less complaints than the Zmodo, QSee, Defender, Bunker Hill, etc systems, but if I was to guess they all roll off the same Chinese assembly line.The cameras are pretty good at night, their IR illuminators (24 LEDS) do a respectable job of lighting up their area at night.  I'd say they are good for 60 feet or so, which is plenty for my small yard.  They are mounted outside and have since held up well through this winter.  Although they've only been online for a couple of months.I have to say the E-mail tech support responds pretty quick, but they tend to be a cryptic and short as the manual, which leads me to believe we may be dealing with an overseas E-mail center.I go between wanting to smash the thing with a hammer or buying another to expand my coverage.  Like I said you get what you pay for.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Workable on Firefox & excellent video quality", "Author": "NewDad", "ReviewID": "R20H9DK51MXKFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Based on the nice feedback on Newegg, I chose to buy the system on Amazon due to the tax issue...Anyway, no complaint! The CCD sensor cameras faithfully deliver video quality crystally clear!The control graphic design is easily understandable.After did the portforwarding, set the network configuration, and install the app on app store, I now can live view on my iPhone.I noticed that I had to run a batch file in my computer and then I can have full remote control under Firefox or Chrome.If you are a fan of Firefox or Chrome like me, this system should currently be the best choice in the market.If you use IE browser, you don't need to install anything as the system's optimal default is for IE.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00492C1MK"}}
