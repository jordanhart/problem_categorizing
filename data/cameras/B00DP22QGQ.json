I am still learning all the different features but with two kids ages 1 and 3 speed and ability to snap those action shots has been outstanding. Low light performance is another key we wanted and this camera has not disappointed. I only wish there was a classic viewfinder for those full sun days. We took it to Disney World with us and with the included carrying case through my belt loop it was very easy to carry around and fast to access. Much better than lugging my SLR.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Point & Shoot", "Author": "Michael Hansen", "ReviewID": "R36AHOMO37YHO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Camera with remarkable lens.
