{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another great kodak camera", "Author": "Mom22boys", "ReviewID": "R28IH4MAIX7ZRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Several years ago I had a point and shoot camera from kodak and I loved it.  Then I decided to try 2 different brands of point and shoot (Sony and Nikon) and I was dissappointed with both.  I came back to Kodak and am so happy with my decision.This camera is a little bigger than a typical point and shoot (meaning, I can't fit it in my pocket)  but the zoom that it offers is well worth it!  Especially since most of my pictures are of my kids playing sports.  I love all the different settings that are offered:  Sports, Portrait, Panoramic, Outside (Bright Light)Night Landscape, Fireworks... etc... There is a manual mode too but I haven't tried that yet.I wish it would have come with a strap.  But that isn't a deal breaker, I can pick one up at the store.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Gary O. Barton", "ReviewID": "RQB2RVZ8L2ENX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures.  If I had known it was being discontinued I may have questioned the purchase.  I cannot get help to fix a problem.  I'm not able to connect camera to computer.  Connection doesn't work.  I went to Kodak and am told, Camera discontinued no help available.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "last of the Kodaks", "Author": "Miss Robinson", "ReviewID": "R3F8TN5I5BM6BL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is completely unavailable in the UK so I ordered from America. I like the sport setting - it's good for wildlife. The flower setting(macro) is superb. The zoom when taking a photo is quite good but you have to wait a short while for it to focus properly after you have zoomed in. I am thinking of buying an eye fi card to see if I could use it to send pictures via wifi easily. I find easyshares very good even when you haven't zoomed in and later crop the image - the subject becomes even clearer. An easyshare was the first really good camera I had and really got me started on photography as a hobby.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "CameraBuff", "ReviewID": "R273U6F3V9D86Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got one of these from Woot about a year ago and have been pretty happy with the camera. Auto-focus is generally pretty good and most of the scene settings are pretty effective. In manual mode it is a bit cumbersome to select ISO settings, and if you need to make changes on the fly you are better off with the pre-set modes but they handle things pretty well. Sport seems particularly effective. Zoom is fairly slow, so if you are trying to catch a moving shot you might be out of luck. Also the on/off lever can easily be caught while reaching for the zoom lever, ending up with a powered down camera when you are trying to catch a shot. Finally there is no view finder, which find annoying, especially in glare situations where you can't see the LCD. However shot quality has been very good,even when shooting subjects in motion. I don't really use the video, so no comment there. I have moved up to a Micro 3/4 rig, but I still keep this for travel when I want better quality than my camera phone, but don't want to lug around multiple lenses. It's too big for your pocket, but it is pretty light to carry around with the strap, and won't take up much space in a back pack.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "great pic", "Author": "woody507", "ReviewID": "R14ATB83X6TRBL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera really puts out great pics, we have had real good luck with this camera and the batteries last better than others we have tried, it is user friendly", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "about this camera", "Author": "william P. Hutchins", "ReviewID": "R22O4SNOUS1TQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cant say that this camera takes as good pictures as my canon ,,but. the smaller package and cost it great here, this camera seems to focus well in every mode except macro , and super macro. however you can do a lot of work with this one like panoramas, 26 power zoom ,18 mp quality . and not carry 3 lenses . is built  sort of flimsy as compared to a canon , or something like that . but it is not on their par . for a one lense carry instant type of camera . its hard to beat . i use this one a lot when i dont want to risk my canon", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easyshare Z5120", "Author": "Billie Wieer", "ReviewID": "R15XNHG8G67D40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it!  easy to use.  makes me look like a pro!  am still finding more ways to be creative and accurate in my picture taking.  am glad that I can finally take family photos that look great.
