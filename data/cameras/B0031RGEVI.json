{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic 15X Optical Zoom, Solidly Built Camera", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "RAYZ3ODNPPIVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned many Fuji digital cameras over the years, this is my first Olympus camera ever.  What sold me was the 15X optical zoom and the price.  The Fuji 30X zoom camera Fujifilm FinePix HS10 10 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 30x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD costs too much.  After seeing first-hand what good quality pictures I can get from this Olympus, I'll seriously look at this brand for future camera purchases.PROS:>>>  1 GB of INTERNAL memory - some of it is used by the on-board manual - you can get by without buying an SD card. With internal memory and the camera set at 12 MP resolution, you can take 112 pictures or 14 minutes of video without adding an SD card. The manual is INSIDE the camera - so you can access it anytime you need help - even if you are out in the boonies with no PC.  Get out your reading glasses, the print is small.>>>  Quality-build - this camera just \"feels good\" in your hand, not one of those flimsy little ultra-compact cameras that are so popular now.  Easy enough to grip with your right hand.  Heavy enough that it requires a neck strap, not a hand strap to carry it.>>>  Magic Filter Settings:  Fun way to play with your pictures.  You can also create art with these - settings are:  pop art, pinhole, fish eye and drawing.  Take a picture of your child and print it out in the \"drawing\" setting; your child can color it in with his/her crayons.CONS:  (my cons aren't all bad, it all depends on what YOU are looking for in a camera)>>>  No optical viewfinder.  Not a big deal to me, but might be to you.  Your only viewfinder with this camera is the LCD screen.>>>  Not so easy to carry in your bag, unless you have a large tote or a backpack - but on the \"pro\" side, this DSLR-style camera is smaller than others I have tried.>>>  I don't like the lens cap on this camera; too bad they can't make them internal like the point-and-shoot-type cameras.  You must remember to remove it yourself before taking a shot. And make sure you attach it with the included string, because if you do not, you will lose it, it falls off easily.>>>  The camera is almost too easy to turn on. Maybe it's just the way I pick it up, but I almost 100% of the time inadvertently turn it on before I want to, then of course the lens cap flies off.OTHER:If you are looking for lots of manual controls like the older SP series, this is not the camera for you (the kind where you control aperture, etc.) Personally, I like EASY.  I don't know anything about F-stops, etc., so this camera is perfect for me; like a point and shoot, only better.  You are able to choose different scenes, exposure, white balance, ISO, like most point & shoots today.  This also takes panorama shots with the set-up inside the camera.This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased where you have to connect the camera to your computer during the set-up.  I'm not convinced this is a good idea - my USB ports are not easily accessible on my desktop PC and it would not set-up correctly when plugged into a hub.  However, once I moved my tower and plugged it into the actual port, it installed without any problems.  This type of set-up is done because you do not receive any photo-editing software CD with the camera, the Olympus iB software is installed on your PC during the set-up of the camera.  I imagine this would be next to impossible if you have dial-up internet.The iB Olympus software also does NOT work with Windows XP - at least not with mine at work but I only have 512K of RAM on that computer.  It DOES work on my home PC with Vista and 3 GB RAM.  But you aren't missing much if you can't use the iB software.  It's horrible and I just went back to using Picasa.As far as response time, this model is faster than I expected since it has AA batteries.  Start-up and recovery after taking a shot was faster than other cameras in the $100 to $200+ price range, even those with lithium-ion batteries;  around 1 second after a shot with no flash, about 2 seconds to recover after a flash picture.CONCLUSION:This is a good camera that should serve you well for a few years.  I never look for a camera to last me years and years since there is always new technology just around the corner and I want the latest.  This camera will make you look like a semi-professional even if you are a novice!", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "High Hopes - Poor Results", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "RR0AXCXHP2NJY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this as a successor to my Olympus C2040Z as I've had (and continue to have) great results with thats 11 year old camera which I've used to take well over 23,000 pics over the years.  Let's get down to the nitty gritty - image quality and performance:  very disappointing.Indoor performance was a roll of the dice on any setting including auto, setting it for incandescent or fluorescent lighting, whatever seemed appropriate. I would say less than 4 out of 10 pictures taken were acceptable, even after using Photoshop to fix them.  Taking the exact same shots at the same time with my 11 year old Olympus, all were fine.  I took both cameras to a wedding and clicked off 211 pics with the SP600 and a friend, using my old C2040Z, clicked off roughly 100.  Indoor lighting for the ceremony and reception had typical banquet hall lighting conditions and styles...not great, but something surely this technological wonder should be able to handle.  Guess again.  Even after spending a good deal of time in Photoshop trying to fix things, I was able to keep 17 out of 211 pics from the SP600.  Same shots taken with my old Olympus....out of 100 pics, only 3 were unusable.  Thinking this can't be right, I returned the SP600 and exchanged it for another, new in the sealed box.  Same indoor results....very poor....from inability to focus properly to graininess to white balance being very off....you name it, it failed at it.Outdoors,up to approximately 10x zoom it works alright...but I expected much better.  Beyond that, the graininess spikes and image quality takes a nose dive and it's next to useless, especially if the lighting isn't perfect.  Pics that were taken closer, up to approximately 5x optical zoom were what I expected out of this camera for quality.  Overall, a big disappointment and out of 480 pics taken over a 3 week period, I was able to salvage and keep just over 50.  I returned it for a full refund.Bottom line - you get what you pay for!  This technological marvel (on paper) is only a $250 suggested retail piece and I was able to buy it for $150.  The C2040z 11 years ago had a retail price of over $400.  Like most other electronics these days, components are cheapened to death and the marketing department budgets are far larger than the quality control budgets.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Zoom", "Author": "Small House Small Budget", "ReviewID": "RZURN59QQ2MOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Features and Video Quality only got 4 stars because I don't have enough experience in these areas to give a more definitive answer.  Value for Price also got only 4 stars.  Olympus cameras tend to be on the higher side, though not at the top, and now there are other comparable cameras on the market.  I paid over $300, and I think under $300 is a better price point.Last fall, we purchased another digital camera, one with a 24X zoom.  As it is somewhat bulky, I have tended to carry my old workhorse, a 5MP Kodak with a 10X zoom, when away from home.  My husband has ended up as the primary user of the new camera.  While I had been thinking of upgrading the  5MP camera, it was low on the list of \"Things To Buy.\"Two things influenced me in purchasing the Olympus SP-600 UZ.  One was that one of the shopping channels offered it on installment payments, making it seem less of a luxury item.  Not only did it have a higher megapixel count, but it also had a bigger zoom--until quite recently, hard to come by at a reasonable price, though now there are several models to choose from.  The second factor was the Olympus brand.  We also have an Olympus Stylus which is impact-resistant, waterproof, and will operate at low temperatures.  Because of the small zoom on this camera, we generally use it only when on the water, but I do like the color saturation of the photos.Of course I read the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere before deciding to go ahead with the Olympus SP-600UZ.  Reviewers  discussed the lack of a printed manual, so I had downloaded it from the Olympus website even before my camera arrived.Per the instructions, I loaded the drivers and the accompanying IB software.  I then hooked up the camera to my computer to set it up.  To my consternation, nothing happened.  When I touched the cable to remove it,  a message flashed across the camera screen warning that the cable should not be disconnected.While I was still puzzling out what my next step should be, the software finally loaded and the \"first use\" procedure began.  What I had assumed to be a malfunction was actually just an excruciatingly slow process.  (I should note that my computer only has 2 gigs of memory, and I don't know whether that was a factor.  I use Photoshop Elements 8, and this program is considerably slower to load than was the case with Photoshop Elements 7.)The IB software ended up on my computer as a startup program.  Since I'm usually cautious about allowing this, I don't think I was given a choice.  I had to go in and disable it, since I want to download my photos into Photoshop Elements.The manufacturer's assumption seems to be that the user will do a lot of editing in-camera.  This may be a good thing for people with a practiced eye for looking at the captured screen.  For me, it's necessary to get an image up on my computer before making any editing decisions.The menu structure is fairly complex.  I find that I have to use the printed manual  to get a clue about how to get to the sub-menus.  Other than changing the screen mode, though, I don't generally utilize other adjustments.  I'm your basic plain-vanilla user.  If there are be additional functions I'll need away from home, I'll probably have to memorize how to do them to avoid excessive cycling through the menus.  The thought of doing this in bright sunlight is doubly unappealing.  The nested menus are unavoidable when there are a lot of options, though, so the alternative might be dumbing down the camera, not a good thing either.I let the Olympus IB program download the first batch of photos I took.  The program immediately wanted to begin face recognition and asked me to tag the images by geographic location.  This is not something I'm  interested in, though I my give it a whirl at some future time on my stored photos.  I did not attempt to do any editing here, since my experience has been that software included with cameras is more rudimentary than I would like.  From my brief overview of the editing functions in IB, I would say this is the case here.I hooked up the camera again and went into Photoshop Elements.  Elements downloaded not only the images but the in-camera PDF manuals.  (At that point, I was using only the internal memory of the camera.)  I have Elements set up so that I can delete all images by confirming.  Of course I didn't want to lose the onscreen material, so I went back into the camera and deleted the photos manually.  I have added a memory card, which means I can remove downloaded photos with no fear of deleting the PDF files.  This is definitely something to watch out for, though, especially if, like me, you load the batteries and start snapping away the minute the camera is out of the box.  Caution should also be used when formatting a card, as it is possible to format the internal memory by mistake.I'm happy with the photos I've taken so far.  I like the heft of the camera, and the location of the controls feels natural.  Like other people, I've struggled with the infamous battery and card cover.  It's not easy to close, but once it's snapped into place and locked, it seems secure.  So far, I haven't turned on the camera by mistake, but that could be a factor of how I lift it from the case.People have complained about the lens cap coming off too easily.  I think it's made this way because if you turn on the camera before removing the cap, it should pop off without hanging up the lens mechanism (as it pushes out the lens).  My old Kodak had push tabs on the side of the cap, but it still would come off fairly readily, and was maybe only fractionally more likely to remain in place . One feature I  like very much is that the flash doesn't operate until you manually flip it up.  With my old camera, there were occasions when  I was trying to photograph documents or microfilm screens.  These photos were spoiled by the flash reflecting off the surfaces.  Since (typically for me), I hadn't spent much time with the manual, I didn't know how to turn off the flash and was too impatient to try pushing buttons or going through menus.I'm happy with my new camera.  It's a vast improvement over my old one.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very nice point&shoot; camera", "Author": "Marty", "ReviewID": "R30JZ6F0G6TW36", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got it a month ago and was able to use a few times only, but it worked great.Was a little skeptical about the use batteries, but so far I went through one set of four (and took quite a few flash photos). I definitely like the idea of having a set of spare ones just in case your camera dies in the middle of all day long sightseeing.As to picture quality - I'm not a pro, but had different cameras, including SLRs and digital SLRs, my whole life, and this one takes very decent, high resolution pictures. I hoped it would take pictures in dim light, and so far so good, but I didn't play with manual ISO settings yet. It may be even better.I planned to buy an SLR, but the price on this one (and the 800 model), its size and wight make it a perfect family camera that is a little more than typical P&S;, and not as complicated to use as SLR if I want kids and inexperienced adults to take pictures.Overall I'd rate it at 5 stars.

I've seen good and bad reviews and was a little concerned about the purchase.  I had a chance to test the camera first and then decided to buy one.  Now that I've been using it for events and travels, it's even better than I thought it ever could be.It seems to me that the people who write the bad reviews are the ones that don't understand how the camera works.  This Olympus isn't a turn-on-and-just-shoot camera; you need to know how to use the settings.  With that said, if you take the time and read the manual, which really doesn't take that long, you'd be very happy with the camera and all its features.Keep up the good work Olympus!  You may just have me for life!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Review addition 10/27/10:  I recently bought another Olympus camera:  DSLR E-620 with two lens kit.  I still have the SP600UZ and use both with no problems.  I took them to Yosemite and the results were incredible.  I find it interesting that people are having such problems with the 600UZ.  Maybe I was lucky and got a really good one???  Someone wrote they they had blurry pictures.  Did they know that when you zoom in with either a DSLR or a point and shoot ultra zoom camera you usually need a tripod, even if the camera has I.S.?", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good, but not \"perfect\"", "Author": "schreibf", "ReviewID": "R1C4YBESK4A0YI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my 600UZ for a few months now and it's an OK camera - good in some ways and average in others.  I'm not a sophisticated user and generally stick to just 3-4 main uses/features which I rely on heavily.  My biggest complaint: NO ZOOM during (sound turned ON) video shooting - I guess they were worried about motor noise or slow focusing although I'd much rather have the zoom.  This sometimes makes for awkward multiple piece videos, plus I end up being too close in some shots and too far away in others and by the time I get out of the video mode to get just the right framing--- it's too late--- I've missed it!!!  Maybe someone makes a near perfect camera/video combination although I've not heard of it (or played with it) - at least below $500 - although I guess some video units with flash, etc. can take pretty good pics but they are expensive >> $500.I tried using the software and found it to be too confusing and inflexible for my simple needs so I now never use it - I just wait until it automatically fires up, then click it out.The resulting pics are good although I've had better with SONY cameras over the years.  This is probably my 10th or 15th camera (I've lost count), most swapped or given away for a later, different, etc.The one reviewer was right about the power button--- I turn on the camera, inadvertently, most every time I handle it, although the lens cap is easily pushed off.Battery life seems at least fair although I've only shot a couple of hundred pics and a few dozen short videos with 2+ sets of four AA alkalines.Like other reviewers have said, one needs to go through all of the features at least once to determine its usefulness and to set up the camera initially as some features make pics results worse.The camera seems to be built like a tank and is a nice size and if I don't get too frustrated with the non-zoom (with sound ON) video I might keep it!?Update!!  It's been several months and now this camera's battery evaluation has gone \"bad.\"  Sometimes I can take many pics/movies with new alkalines or freshly charged batteries--- other times it says battery low almost immediately and won't operate!

IT STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY AFTER FOUR MONTHS.I had been looking for a camera for months when I stumbled across this Olympus.  I like Olympus for its reputation.  The look and internal 1GB memory is what initially drew me to this camera.  I am a nature photographer and wanted to test macro settings.  This camera has macro and super macro which allows you to get within inches of the subject you are shooting.  I was blown away by the quality of photos taken with these settings.  The zoom lens is also amazing.  I was in the gardens a few miles away from Sutro tower and used the 15x zoom to get a shot and Wow! It was clear, crisp and not grainy at all.  I also took a low light condition video which displayed great. I've tested the flash in very low light conditions and was pleasantly surprised.  So far it is everything I wanted in a camera.The only downside was when connecting it to my computer, there were glitches in the software and I could not upload my photos.  So, I uninstalled it and used my old software and everything is fine.  It is easy to use, compact enough that you can fit it into a large purse and is also very easy to hold and maneuver.

Unfortunately, image quality isn't one of them.Likes: handling/size/ergonomics, build quality, zoom, hd video, creative digital filters, lcd display, hi-speed capture mode, image write speed, 1GB iternal memory, customization options in program mode (P).Dislikes: poor to below average image quality, initial setup, digital noise/grain, in-memory manual.I am a photography enthusiast and have several film and digital cameras. My main camera is a $500 10.2MP DSLR that takes excellent picutres. For everyday use, I have a $70 8MP point and shoot, which takes good pictures. The $200 12MP Olympus doesn't compare well to the $70 camera, in terms of image quality. Literally, I would trade all of the fancy features and megapixels for better images. But it was a gift from my wife.The camera lens needs a lot of light to take below average pictures. And it doesn't focus well. You have to stand very still or prop yourself against something solid to get the best shots. That doesn't help much if the subject is moving. I always hold it still a second or two after the shot. If I don't do this, there's a good chance the image will be blurry. In my experience, the image stabilization only kicks in for low light, which this camera despises. Close shots (within a few feet) are decent with the flash because it freezes the subject.In general, the pictures are low-contrast, flat in color, too soft, and show little detail. Highlights are often too bright and shadows too dark. Sometimes the colors will bleed and appear muddy or show signs of chromatic aberation, fringing, or other artifacts. Digital noise is also a problem. And the auto white balance is easily fooled, especiially indoors.Some of these things can be fixed by digital processing, but it's not worth the effort. Most blurry images are garbage.

The reason why I chose this camera in the first place was because it was an Olympus & my previous camera of 8 years was an Olympus & I loved it.  My old Olympus would probably still be working to this day if my cat didn't decide to pee on it.Like my previous camera I took excellent care of this one with the added precaution of making sure to lock it up if it wasn't in my hands to avoid the possibility of my cat using it for her bathroom needs.Overall the picture quality in the beginning seemed to be pretty good.  I never had need to use all of the features.  Some that I thought I would have a lot of fun with never really performed as expected (poor quality) that I eventually gave up on them.  My number one need for this camera is for business.  I need to take pictures & very good ones at that of what I sell.  I need them to be crisp clear & professional.  As the year went on I noticed that the camera stopped performing correctly.  An example is I set up my studio with excellent lighting & background.  This was working fine.  After a time the camera would adjust the color to yellows.  No matter how many ways to Sunday I made adjustments to the camera & my studio lighting I was getting yellow pictures 7 times out of 10.  This wasted a lot of time & added a lot more work when it came to editing.Regarding the photo software that comes with the camera.  It took a long time to load all of it & it would always crash & freeze.  I stopped using it within a month.Another peeve is it uses FOUR AA batteries!  It was a power hungry beast.  I had to buy extra rechargeable batteries as the quantity I already had wasn't enough to keep up with the beast.  All those batteries add substantial weight to the camera.The camera lens is virtually useless.  It has a cord to attach it to the camera so you don't loose it.  It doesn't fit tightly to the lens & is in the way more than not.Now that this piece of crap died after barely a year I decided to order a \"cheap\" camera for my business needs.  NOT any Olympus.  I ordered a Canon. No reason other than it has good reviews, the price seems reasonable & it uses a lithium ion battery that recharges.  Photo editing software should more than make up for any flaws in the camera.  Never again will I pay top dollar.  My old Olympus was not top of the line & last many years as mentioned.  Manufacturers simply are not making products with the same quality as they used to.  I am learning that there is simply no point in buying the more expensive item as it will likely break after a little over a year.

The bottom line of this review is that I am very pleased with this camera and have already recommended it to friends. As stated I have used it in a variety of scenarios and it has performed  very acceptably with a couple reasonable limitations. First off if you are expecting the performance of a full SLR rig you are going to be disappointed. You should increase your price point and at least go with the SP-800 UZ. This is a budget priced Ultra Zoom and it performs as well as you are going to find for less than $250 bucks. There is a learning curve for those of you coming from pocket point and shoot style cameras, but for those willing to learn the strengths and weaknesses of this camera it will satisfy, I assure you. The strengths and features are all summarized by Olympus on the page here, and I wasn't disappointed in any way nor did I feel oversold as to what the features entailed or how this camera would perform. All and all this camera's feature set is quite extensive and all features perform as designed. The shortcomings of this camera are the same as any other camera in this class, marginal night shot performance, that being said the camera increases the ISO to capture the image in low light settings and increasing the ISO inevitably creates a more \"grainy\" image. It's manageable with a decent editing suite (corel paintshop photo pro x3 has been handling it for me) and shouldn't discourage you from purchasing this camera. I have been able to attain great photos at night, but not without making the appropriate adjustments under the Program mode. Otherwise the Night scene mode and a tripod will give you stunning night shots, but you definitely need a tripod as it is a slow exposure.) I have had some purple fringing when zoomed in under bright conditions once or twice out of thousands of shots, again common to the class and not anything that can't be corrected after the shot. The AF performs very well, requiring a little patience every now and then for it to acquire the right focus, especially when zoomed in all the way. These issues are common at this price point and if you absolutely can't live with the thought of having a camera that performs very well almost all of the time, but not perfectly, then spend more money and get one!

I had previously had an Olympus camera for 8 years before it died a natural death from overuse....I love this camera! If you don't use the flash, the indoor quality is poor, and it still may be poor with the flash. It may be that I am just very inexperienced. Also, this thing eats rechargeable batteries. Its best to purchase the regular old Duracell AA's or your preferred brand. When the battery level gets low it starts to take the pictures much slower and the quality will look grainy. But the most I have shot in a single battery run are about 500 pictures, not in rapid mode.This camera is fast, I haven't missed a single shot of my little ones.I am able to store just over 500 pics on the cameras internal memory. Out door photos are beautiful.In my opinion, this is a fantastic value for the price. I couldn't find anything as fast that takes pretty pictures.I can zoom in from very far away. We were swimming the other day and I was able to get face shots of my daughter from more than 500 yards away.As far as the video quality, its a great quality.

I like all of the camera's features (built in memory, 15x optical zoom, multiple selectable `scene' modes, the easily activated `record' button and the use of AA batteries). I LOVE the $130 (Costco) price, but the SP-600 misses the mark in two important categories; Video Zoom and Auto-Focus.For reasons beyond my ability to comprehend, Olympus has chosen to disable the optical zoom if you are recording video using the microphone. In the `no sound' mode the optical zoom works as it should, but with the built in microphone on, the optical zoom is disabled. Who thought that was acceptable? The days of silent pictures are over, Olympus. If I'm going to record in movie mode, I want to be able to use the built in optical zoom and include sound. This is a deal breaker for me.Then there's the poor auto-focus performance. It works OK until you zoom in on something (like the wispy clouds and the horizon at sunset) and then it blurs. If this problem cannot be corrected, why not build in a manual focus override capability?  Well I guess it's not really all that important on the SP-600UZ as far as I'm concerned, `cause the lack of an optical zoom in video mode is enough to break the deal for me.

On paper, this camera has all the qualities I could ever ask for.But the bottom line is this: The image quality is not great. It fares poorly in low light, producing images that are both blurry and grainy at the same time. Even correcting images in Photoshop just can't eliminate the grainy quality. The colors aren't vibrant, and for such an impressive looking camera it produces mediocre images.The first month I used this camera it developed a computer virus within the internal memory and refused to take any more pictures or upload the old ones. I was not aware that digital cameras could even get computer viruses, but this one managed to pull off that feat. Olympus was unable to help me and sent me a form email with suggestions like \"Did you try turning it off?\" I managed to delete the virus after a week of exhausting attempts (I had to hack into my own camera), but not before I'd transmitted a virus to a bunch of local internet cafes (which I probably should never visit again).I debated sending this camera back from the very beginning, but instead I settled and kept it.

My mom has a canon sd990is who cares about going outside taking picture of a tree in the dark how many times are you going to do that. and who would. the 990is did not pass this test and i was pretty upset i got this camera for my mom in december of 08 and its pretty much canons top of the line elph camera. but it turned out to be junk. all the birds that were taken were pixeled blurry i could not use one of them for my kodakgallery redemption coupon. but all the pictures on the olympus sp600uz i took pictures of blue birds, blu jays, and black birds and they where all clear i trashed the black birds cause what are you gonna do with a black bird picture. i kept the blu jays and the blue birds pioture i got a 8x10 frame and i going to put it on my wall thats how clear it came out. I took it through my window with the flash off. same thing my mother did with her 990is and hers none of them where any good. I highly recommend this camera to someone that is really into photography. It is slighty Bigger then a pocket Camera But you will get quality with it. It is worth the money. When using digital zoom picture will became blurry and slighty dark just turn off digital zoom just use optical zoom thats not that far but thats my exprience with it you will get good photos if you follow my directions make sure you shutter it half way lock it then press all the way down otherwise you will get blurry photos especially words on boxes in the background will be blurry. all in all its a little bit of a pain but its an slr style its not a point and shoot have paitence with it and you will get better pictures then a point and shoot will ever will.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Probably a good camera", "Author": "A", "ReviewID": "RHVTHS9H0FPYB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received a new camera, but it had factory defects (Pressing the shutter consistently restarted the camera instead of taking the picture, ate 4 AA batteries every 10 minutes [no joke]).

I had to send it back and got a Sony DSC H20. Huge difference, better quality, and size. Feels a little cheaper, but overall far better than the Olympus.

I am sure that this olympus is great if you have a working model. Enormous storage capacity. Probably best for studio photography, sorta good at macro too, but a little blurry.But for an all purpose camera, check out the sony. You can see the craters on the moon with it! Drawback is that it has very small capacity, you can take about 3-5 10 MP photos or a 2 sec. vga video. Can hold about 50 VGA photos, though. Definitely needs a SD card for anything better than VGA. HUGE zoom, though- you can read a book from 25 feet away! Photos look extremely blurry (especially at high zoom) until you press the shutter, and then they really sharpen up.
