It has worked flawlessly since the day I installed it.  I already had the camera connected to my CATV system, and with a frequency modulator, set it up so you could tune to a specific channel to see the camera feed from any TV in the house.I simply added a BNC video splitter to add the feed to the video encoder, and it worked first try.  The Gsurf software that comes with it is OK, but I would recommend something like Blue Iris, it is much more functional.  If the software had been \"awesome,\" I would give this product 5 stars.This camera will work with Synology DSM 4.1, by the way.  However, Blue Iris is a lot cheaper than buying the camera licenses for the Synology NAS.I ended up buying another GrandStream wireless IP cam, and that also has been a solid performer, no hiccups or issues.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not reliable and lacked easy setup.", "Author": "Richard Silberman", "ReviewID": "R3I7VRVM4UYH2W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Created a lot of difficulty when pairing with a Cradlepoint router.
