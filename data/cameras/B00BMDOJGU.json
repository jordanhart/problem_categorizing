Love the total package thing so I didn't have to worry that I forgot something I needed.", "Author": "Jeannine Jones", "ReviewID": "R15Y5PYMFYCFCW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the total package.  I recommend charging both batteries, just in case.  I think the case is a bit odd shaped to hold all that you need but just had to move things around instead of keeping everything together.  Really easy to use.  Photos were wonderful.  Zoom brought you front and center. Auto-focus was wonderful.  Still photos and video looked professional.  Highly recommend this camera and accessories.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good!", "Author": "Zinsu Emmanuel", "ReviewID": "R2KFP0VN4FJBMW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received my order today and looking at it I think it's a good product.
