I bought this with the money I received from my baby shower. New baby New camera. I researched alot. about 15 hours of research went into this. I loved what was offered in this bundle and the price was great. It came with everything listed, nicely packaged and within five days of my order. I loved unpacking it all and laying it out on my dining room table. chirstmas for mamma! The camers does not seem light weight to me like in some of the reviews. It is firm and heavy. The camera takes great pictures and better then the other women. yeah me! Its easy to understand yet, I can take it several steps further and become more creative and professional. The manual software it came with is very instructional. The photo software works great but is not as good as some professional software I have used. The two lenses work great, althrough I was confusd at first about how to get them on. The cleaning kit is sweet, The card is large enough to hold aton of pictures. The extras seeme fine and good quality to me. I was not expecting top notch, didnt get it but, they are better then I thought they would be. Tripod is steady. The case was too bulky for me to carry so I bought a sling case, which works perfectly for me and everything fits. I love this bundle. You cant beat this camera for the price. I also evaluated the megapixal against 18 megapixal. this is aobut 12,000 compared to 18,000 megapixals which is not a big differance expecially if you compare the much more expensive price for the higher megapixel. so, a great buy.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Christopher R Strache", "ReviewID": "R2S4SWUI7IUVPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera with awesome features.

It takes good quality pictures, but doesnt have all the features that you would find in a more expensive camera.

For those who don't care about always seeing the shot and are willing to guess at it frequently it also has a very good screen (far better than most) which can be used.  For people who want to be creative and sometimes make their own settings instead of the automated ones for special effects, etc. it also allows that.  A good bit to learn in so using it, but good tutorials come with.  Unfortunately, for that creativity Canon provides only a rather brief summary type written manual to carry along. There is, however, a complete on line manual so you eventually will be able to remember all you need to know to be creative. It's just a bit hard to practice with the so-called manual since dragging your computer along for taking creative shots, loading the CD, reading it....well you get the picture!  Or maybe you won't!!", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R34VAXI0MGO4T1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this product as a semi-starter set for my son.

The price is amazing low for the quality. I bought this about a year ago and everything in this bundle is amazing, couldn't be happier.

I was worried it didn't since it didn't specify.This is my first DSLR camera and so far I am happy playing with it! I had a SLR Minolta for a while then I went to a regular point and shoot which didn't allow me much control.Well, this camera does! I haven't tried the tripod yet but my sister(who also has this bundle) likes it a lot.I CANNOT express how awesome the quality is, even with video. Its very crisp and clear.The adapter lens that attaches to the camera is cool too though I didn't know at first how to screw on the lenses and filter.I highly recommend this bundle since for this price you can only get the camera body and not the lens anywhere else.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's awesome!!!", "Author": "beansheller", "ReviewID": "RL8TECXEM2DSS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can not rave about this camera enough.

Other shops were selling the same camera/lens(only) for more than the cost of the entire package.This is my first DSLR camera - I previously pruchased an advance point&shoot; (Nikon L810) but decided I wanted something that gave me more creative control.  So happy I exchanged the L810 for the T3!I was able to take great pictures straight out of the box using some of the auto controls and love that I am able to experiment with the shutter speed and aperture individually and/or simulataneously.I am addicted to taking pictures now!PS - Cameta Camera shop were the best when it came to purchasing, exchanging, shipping times etc.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "mel", "ReviewID": "R2E212DIMJ81UW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had this camera package for a great deal.
