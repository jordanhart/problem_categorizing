When about three months old one camera and that channel of the recorder failed. Everything was plugged into a \"line surge suppressor\" so, NO, it was not lightning! After a fashion they replaced the defective units ... a real pain to replace custom installed camera and concealed recorder.Now,a second camera has failed ... but that is not the bad news. Every time there is a power outage the system needs to be reconfigured? This is something that takes the better part of an hour because it looses its network identity and requires the attachment of an external monitor and mouse. After the last event (power outage) I realized that I could review the captured video on an external monitor if there was a need. The remaining issues: 1) It is a pain to move a monitor into the walk-in closet, 2)this means that there is no consistent monitoring of the system and 3)the only compatibility is with Microsoft Explorer (lots of luck with internet security).", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great user friendly system", "Author": "Bchbumobx", "ReviewID": "R39WVTNOZ0KVWO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This DVR security system is a great product. I have never owned one of these systems, but found it very user friendly to set up and use. The IR night vision cameras work really well in complete darkness and you get a great color picture in daytime recording. I highly recommend this system for home or business use.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$524.99", "Features": "Record over one month of continuous video footage on the 500GB hard drive; iPhone and Blackberry compatible - access live footage from your smart phone\nFast and hassle-free setup - the coaching iMenu will guide you through the entire setup process; View video online with no service fees - view your DVR's live or recorded video footage anywhere in the world\nView in the dark with automatic night vision - see any monitored area in total darkness\n24/7 lifetime Live Customer Service - our experts will get you online in no time", "Name": "SVAT CV502-4CH-X Web Ready 4 Channel H.264 500GB HDD DVR Security Surveillance System with Smart Phone Access and Coaching iMenu", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31uHH0nlJqL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003IJ1UC2"}}
