The only benefit is the extra batteries and chargers. The tripods aren't strong enough to hold a hot wheels car. The bag has a gassy odor. I've soaked it in downy fabric softener and washed it 3 times and it won't go away. The flash doesn't work like its supposed to.

All of the items are on the cheaper side and you might get a better deal if you bought the items separately.  That being said, it's an easy way to try some of the lenses and filters out.  The bag is kind of cheap, I will probably buy a better one soon.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "That will do pig that will do", "Author": "Phobby", "ReviewID": "R8OJ3Q55RESDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So beyond the package wich looked like crap when recived ( delivered by UPS) the batteries have served well so far have not had any issue with original batteries or chargers workin with either or, the lenses both have been fun, the images of the product seem a little miss leading the bag is small ad barely fits the camera with a lense attached. The card reader was diffrent as well as the tripod, but hey I did not expect alot, I was missing the filters, shortly after contacting them I recived an email apologizing for the missing items and that they were shipping out ASAP.This pack is great for the inspired and beginer photographer, Not for pro!", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "Martin Guzman \"MGuzman\"", "ReviewID": "R1DMZYASDYRAU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the items in a very timely manner and was very pleased with the products.
