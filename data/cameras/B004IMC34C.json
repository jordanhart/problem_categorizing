I'm glad I made this order. The camera excellent, straight out of the box, put in the battery that comes with it (and has a charger for the battery) it is good to go to start taking pictures...HOWEVER, (this is why I didn't rate it 5 stars) THIS KIT DOES NOT COME WITH A LENS, A BIG MISTAKE THAT I MADE, I HOPE YOU REALIZE THIS BEFORE YOU ORDER THIS KIT. That being said, I went a got a lens for $149 and was able to start taking pictures.So all in all this is an excellent camera even though I couldn't use it right away. But shopping around this is the best deal for your buck because I was able to to get a lens and this kit for under $2,000, which is about what you would spend if you got a kit that comes with a lens, BUT THEN AGAIN WHEN I BOUGHT THE KIT WAS LISTED FOR $1,394.99 AND I HAVE NOTICED SINCE THEN THE PRICE HAS JUMPED BIG TIME. So still shop around and choose wisely.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a great package!", "Author": "Knife", "ReviewID": "R3II650JTCTVAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This package is a perfect starter kit but when you are looking for lenses use a 18-55mm lense and but the poliroid adapters so you can turn it into what ever you want. poliroid are a very good product that is very capatable with some of the nikon lenses.
