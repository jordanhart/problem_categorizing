Granted 3 are Canon mount and the other three are Sony Alpha mount. I bought it because it was said to be sharp wide open - and it is! The only other 50 that is so is the Canon 50mm f2.5 [quasi] macro.I love the color, contrast and sharpness of this lens on my A700. It is fast focusing and hits more than any other 50mm that I own. It is way more reliable than the Canon 50mm f1.4 for sure. From f2.8 on the Sony 50mm f1.4 is its equal and the Canon version is close. I choose this lens over my cz24-70mm f2.8 mostly due to the superior DOF and low light capability.The only thing about this lens that might be a draw back is that it only only goes up to f16. If I need higher than that I have to use my Sony 50mm. Usually, I rarely go beyond f11.I would recommend this lens to to anyone looking for a fast focusing, sharp and reliable 50mm.", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bokeh master", "Author": "K. Jorgensen", "ReviewID": "R3OQXBT1RGNBNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having feared Sigma's QC, I felt hesitant to purchase. This lens works perfectly and is the companion to my cz135mm. lens. I've had to take in my Nikon 70-200mm VI, and 24-70mm zooms to the repair center, the first for back focus, and the later for the known abrasive sound from the zoom ring, and for front focus. Both now are superb. The Sigma has been through two shoots and performed as expected. The bokeh is creamy, the resolution and detail is quite astounding looking at a Sony A900 file. This is the first outside party lens I have purchased, and I may look at the upcoming 85mm f/1.4 lens by Sigma also if it proves to be as good as the 50mm.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "My evaluation of the Sigma 50mm f/1,4 EX DG HSM for Sony Alpha DSLR Cameras:", "Author": "N. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R2RDZO7U8O2ERE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am TOTALLY PLEASED by this excellent lens.  It is FAR MORE than I had expected.  I do appreciate the Sigma people for designing, manufacturing and presenting it to the photographic public.I am an available light photographer.  Although I do occasionally use flash, I generally prefer the much greater convenience and  practicality of being able to photograph without the additional complications, limitations and expense of additional lighting equipment.  Also, some venues prohibit flash.So, this Sigma 50mm f/1,4 EX DG HS lens is a welcome solution.This lens has been designed to be  practical, durable, simple and easy to operate and reliable.  The resulting photographs are superb.  I intend to purchase Sigma photographic products again and again.  And I intend to return to Amazon as my source.The lens arrived quicker than I had expected.  It was in excellent condition.  I feel that the price was highly acceptable.  The bottom line:  for me, this was a FIVE STAR deal in every way.Thank you much,Neil Wilson", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truly sharp and beautiful bokeh", "Author": "Chilehead Photography \"Captured Moments are t...", "ReviewID": "R1I6JQBEA8P88J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my Sony A77 after doing my research and looking at sample shots versus the sony and minolta options.  What I needed was a 1.4 that I could shoot at 1.4 and the Sony version was soft wide open.  I read how this was sharp wide open and it really is.  I dare say that this is one my sharpest lenses. The bokeh is really beautiful too.... very smooth.  I read some complaints about focus issues, but mine has done a good job so far, even just using the center point.  Its also very quick.  I would buy this over the Sony version all over again.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "best lens I own.....period", "Author": "Silverkoup", "ReviewID": "REPQK80AFSQ70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This lens attached to my Sony a77 is a match made in heaven. For low light shots, this lens is amazing. For portraits at 1.4, the DOF is great, creamy bokeh, sharp subject. Manual focus is easy and smooth, but auto focus is amazing. This is the only lens I own with a HSM focus system and it is amazing and quiet. The auto focus hits quick with the a77 and is 9/10 focused on the correct area. I don't know what else to say other than get this lens, it is a great lens sharp at 2.8, creamy bokeh from 1.4-2.0 (still great after 2.0, but 1.4-2.0 is butter) just get it stop going back and forth, it is worth every penny.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!", "Author": "Joyce Hubbard", "ReviewID": "R1YUNXJDW0OIKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It did everything I needed it to do and more!

And just look at the size of the front glass element.  But the AF had significant inconsistent back-focus issues that micro-adjustment could not fix.  Maybe I could have sent the lens along with my camera to Sigma for fine tuning... but I do not possess that level of patience.
