Can't beat that with $14, as long as they work.However, there are several issues.1. Battery is not 1800mAh as advertised. If the original one is 1240mAh then you can't really have energy storage breakthrough all of a sudden from 1240 to 1800. There's no improvement in terms of battery life over the original battery.2. The battery is a cheap Chinese battery, completely made in China, but not Japanese battery as advertised.The sticker on the battery also shows \"Designed in the USA/Made in China\".I rated this product with 2-star only because false advertisement are considered as a serious offense by many of us consumers.Would I buy them again? Maybe, if the battery does perform at the same level as the original battery for now.Since the product is new and my review simply reflects the first impression with reasonable amount of usage but I may update the review again in the future.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$13.99", "Features": "Package Includes: 2 Halcyon Brand Battery\nBattery Specs: 1800 mAh with Premium Japanese Cells\nHalcyon Support: Includes 5 Year Halcyon Replacement Warranty.
