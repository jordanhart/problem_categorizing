I have 3 cameras rigged up so far. The monitor displays one of them twice and another not at all. Yes, all connections are done correctly - it's not my error. I switched from quad view to view one of the cameras on full screen. Now it won't switch back to quad mode with either the remote, the buttons on the dvr, or by way of screaming at it or jumping up and down so I can only view one of the cameras now.The manual is for the most part a book of screenshots of what I can see anyway just poking around the system settings and very little explanation on how to use various features. I found it amusing that the back of the manual declares intellectual property rights. Who'd want to claim rights to the intellectual property of something so little actual intellect went into? It is just a useless waste of paper.I will be looking everywhere for this camera being sold online and leave this review. You really should go out of business as you have no idea what you are doing. Or maybe you do and you just don't care?Thanx but no thanx,Re", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "I think regular quality", "Author": "diego fernando toro", "ReviewID": "R37Z31HEYVRE6T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the Dome cameras work fine .. the other worked a single day ... then the image was white. and how to take them to Colombia, I might not use the warranty ...for next time, you better spend a little more for better quality.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$317.99", "Features": "DVR has 500GB HD installed.
