There discription sounded great. When I rec'd them I was delighted. After setting up (very easy) day viewing was ok. Night nothing. Tried all that the seller suggested with no results. Refused new item. Doesn\"t work 1st. time I'm out. (no 3 strikes) Waited almost three weeks for return to find that they charged me for the shipping twice. Had to contact Amazon to ajust. Update. They told Amazon it was scratched thats the reason for the double charge on shipping. THEY lie. My suggestion. Stay away.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "VideoSecu 2 Wireless Security Cameras CCTV Home Surveillance Kit Night", "Author": "sandpiper", "ReviewID": "R11RIV74J0O44P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The cameras seemed of good quality. I think for indoor use and close range, they will work good. My application was for outdoor use and was unsatisfactory. I returned the kit and got a message that my credit card would not be charged and a credit would be given.  If that dosen't happen, I will be writing another review.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "not enough instruction, not what i was expecting", "Author": "deloris", "ReviewID": "R2TDLCQ4STTPBB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not enough instruction with this kit .this  product was working ok  the video was dark,not clear  it wasn't what i  was expected  . it was delivered ontime and in good condition.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$379.95", "Features": "Affordable wireless surveillance solution\n380 TV line video resolution.
