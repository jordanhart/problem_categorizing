{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK camera, but shutter lag is a killer", "Author": "Jeff S.", "ReviewID": "R3O4TW3XULLET0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera has all the settings and features I wanted.  The flash pops-up with a simple flick of your finger.  The screen is huge (no viewfinder, but it doesn't need one).  But the lag between when you press the shutter and when it takes the picture is excruciating!  It's a real bummer because you will constantly miss the shot you want to take by about 1 second...and that is a really long time when taking photos.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera!", "Author": "Grandma Net", "ReviewID": "R3J1L1SCVB6D71", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned several digital cameras, but this one is my favorite out of them all.  My favorite thing about it is the fast shutter action when you turn off the \"auto preview\" so the picture doesn't show right after you've taken it.  Other cameras have had this feature, but doesn't speed up the shutter action like this one.  Especially nice when trying to get that \"perfect shot\" of my grandkids.  They move so fast, I miss some good shots just waiting for the \"ready\" light.  The best part of this camera is the zoom!!!  10x optical, 10-15 x digital.  It is awesome! Pictures of my granddaughter at her softball game came out clear and crisp even with full zoom!!  Image Stabilizer is AWESOME!  So much better than any other camera I've owned!  It is the first camera I've owned with a slide show feature.. I like that.  It has an automatic orientation feature, so no matter how you turn the camera in the review mode, the picture turns right side up.The only downside I can see is the flash is not automatic.  I have to manually open the flash.  However, the camera displays a message when I need the flash.  Given the other great features, the flash problem is a minor inconvenience.  My son and daughter-in-law love it and want one!! I recommend this highly!", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good camera at a good price", "Author": "Alexandre S.", "ReviewID": "R3MJVV4KR9U0KD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was a gift for a friend.
