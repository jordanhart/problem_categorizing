{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great to Carry Around", "Author": "Karen S. Garvin", "ReviewID": "R30MC9XZCCJNF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera two days ago from a camera store (yes, of course it's cheaper here). I have four other cameras, two film (Nikons) and two digital (one Nikon and one Olympus), but I wanted something that I could fit in my purse or backpack. Many times I want to take pictures, but am too lazy to carry my camera gear unless I'm planning a photo outing. This camera literally fits into my jeans pocket so I will be able to carry it every day.So far I find the camera's menu systems are similar to the menu on my other Nikon cameras (N80, D70). This makes the learning curve easier. When you turn the camera off, the lens collapses into the body of the camera, and there is a lens cover that closes over the lens to protect it. That isn't shown in the photograph.I like that the camera allows you to turn off the flash if you don't want it on. I like to do natural light photography; sometimes I don't want the flash. Too many point-and-shoots try to think for the photographer and \"fix\" everything for you, but sometimes you want to do silly things when you're doing experimental art! The camera has several white balance options, as well as monochrome, sepia, and cyanotype (blue). The photographer has the option of using these or adjusting the settings manually.There is a good user manual with the camera. I found it easy to find things in the table of contents, or the index. Instructions are pretty straightforward so you can go to the section you want without having to read the whole chapter.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice point and shoot for price, but has drawbacks", "Author": "DEva", "ReviewID": "R1V43MWE01435F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is the first time that I bought something new on the market. Typically, I buy something after it has been reviewed for at least 6 months, but I had to replace the \"family point and shoot\" before Easter.  I was replacing my old Nikon Coolpix 5900 (which was a little bulky, but took FANTASTIC photos).  I also loved the video quality.  I stayed with the Nikon family because it is what I know, and I just am not ready to pay so much for the Canon lines (and I don't like the photo quality - can't explain, but I like my Nikon better).I got the camera 2 weeks ago, and so far I have found:1) That it is incredibly small - which is good and bad.  It can go anywhere, but holding it makes you kind of nervous, like you could drop it easily.2)The large viewscreen is large, and I am very worried that I may drop it and shatter it easily.  The camera itself is very smooth, and feels \"slippery\" in your hands.3) The one complaint that I know I even had with my old Nikon - shutter/recovery time is slow with this camera - you can't just \"click\" away. This is not so nice when you have fidgety children, and you want to capture a moment.4) The scene/mode setup has slightly changed for me, and to get to a different \"mode\", you can't just turn the dial, like I did on the old 5900, you have to push a few more buttons.  This will be tedious when you are moving from different environments, and want to alter the settings.5) The biggest complaint I have is that this camera is has a very sensitive at autofocusing, and based on what I have seen so far, it will not take pictures closeup unless you actually set it at the macro mode.I don't think I will return it because I have found that unfortunately, these new digital cameras don't seem to last, and I won't invest over $200 for a point and shoot.  This is good for quick shots when you are out on the go, and can fit in your back pocket. For the better photos, I use my D80 (it is a dream).4/4/08 UPDATE - I have used the camera a little more. I have noted that:1) to get the shots to come out, you really have to become quite knowledgeable with how to adjust your settings (exposure compensation, mode, light source, white balance, etc.)  READ THE MANUAL, and PRACTICE.  Once you figure that out, your pictures are fine. This does get a little tedius when you are trying to capture that moment with fidgeting subjects (i.e. children & animals).2) Also, the movies are not MPG's anymore they are now in the AVI format.  They still turn out fine, and the mic is SUPERSENSITIVE3) The latch for the battery compartment is still the same - this worries me because this is what failed on my 5900, (and my mom's Canon).  Once that went out, (and we went on vacation), the camera was never the same (i.e. beach air, sand, AC - you do the math).  You would think they would fix this problem, but I am seeing it with not just one line, but others as well.4)  I am not a real fan of the way you switch from regular camera, to a specific scene (i.e. indoors, niteshots, etc), to movie mode.  You have to push a MODE button, scroll, and then push OK.  The buttons on the back are the same as my old 5900, just a little smaller (men with big fingers could get annoyed easily).5)  The on/off button is TINY and is right in next to the button that you use to take the photos/and take videos (at the top of the camera).  Honestly, I confuse them at times, and will turn the camera off when I want to begin a video.All in all,If I could do all over again, I wouldn't go ultracompact and would go more compact.  It serves it's purpose, but remember - you are getting what you paid for.UPDATE 1/9/09:  By September 08, I had to get another camera because this one decided to break down on my family vacation - I am TRULY not a fan of this camera (the Lens just decided to not open and close).  I will just give it to my 4 yr old, and let her play with it.  I gambled and got the waterproof Pentax, and so far, I am pleased (not elated, but will be satisfied for now).", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S210 8mp", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R2VF3PRBMANW89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Turns on very fastVery compact, excellent to take anywhereNice strap to fit around your hand, very easy to pull it out of your pocket and turn it on all with one hand safely, while your holding other things in your other handBattery seems to last forever enough for so many many pictures a dayGreat quality picturesEasy uploading to computer, software easy to install.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Beginner Compact", "Author": "Kelly from GA \"kellybethga\"", "ReviewID": "R2T9G6GNBM6Q8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my daughter's 5-year-old birthday (some of you may call me crazy, but I'm looking forward to a \"year in pictures from a 5-year-old's perspective\".  I wanted nice picture quality with, and this is paramount, great shutter response.  This camera is very fast, so my daughter doesn't get frustrated thinking she hasn't gotten the shot.  The LCD screen is nice, big and bright.  It's super easy to use - she already knows how to zoom in and out and review pictures (you can go back to picture-taking mode just by pressing the shutter button halfway).  I've been comparing pictures to my Canon SD800 IS and these pictures are as good or better.  The colors are very accurate (also a big consideration for me - my fair skinned family can easily look blue or red with the wrong color balance) and pictures are, while not as sharp as high-end cameras, sharp enough for regular prints.  I think Nikon may be finally putting in some competitive cameras in the compact market.As well - the camera seems very durable, it's made of metal/  A lot of lower-end cameras are plastic.

I'd never owned a digital camera before, so I was looking for one with a reasonable price and not too many complicated features. This camera fits all my needs and more. Physically, it's a cute color (plum) and small enough to slip into your pocket if you're in a rush (as I was when I took it to the Celtics parade). The interface is pretty intuitive, and I personally prefer using a menu to switch modes over the standard wheel as I'm often worried about bumping said wheel by accident!As for the pictures it takes? They're not perfect, but they suit my purpose. Some people may want something with more megapixels, but 8 is enough for me. It sometimes has trouble focusing on the correct subject. It doesn't seem to have much of a problem with pet eye, though! Also, the video feature is a wonderful bonus, it picks up audio surprisingly well. Make sure to buy an SD card, though!A small worry I have is that the battery compartment door seems a little.. \"loose.\" It's not going to pop open on its own, but it does wiggle a little bit and sand could probably get in if you took it to the beach. Buying a case for it would probably decrease that risk significantly, though.Overall, I feel this is a great digital camera for the price and makes a good starter digital camera for someone like me who isn't usually very good with them.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Buy, nothing more, nothing less", "Author": "A.

The camera is so easy to use (I can't stand cameras that make you go through 5 menus just to delete a picture) and user friendly. The quality of pictures is impressive for a camera this size and price. I would tell anyone who bought this camera, to read through the manual at what settings to turn on for different types of pictures. It tells you exactly how to take a picture of all sorts of views, like fireworks, people standing indoors in front of bright windows, etc. It helps a lot to know what to turn on/off for such scenes. Some of the complaints I've read in other reviews make me think that people aren't learning how to use settings properly.The color of the camera is nice, already gotten compliments on it. The view screen is a very good quality. One of the most important features to me is how fast it takes pictures. I also needed a camera that would take good up-close shots of the jewelry I make.

Now THAT is a good camera and it would fit in a cigarette pack if you wished.I've used large, medium and 35mm formats and did my own developing and printing for a few decades. Grain? Very simple: film speed. 100 was ideal, 200 a touch of grain, 400 noticeable and so on. The higher the film speed, the more grain you get. Nothing is free, there is always a trade off. The more difficult you make it for a digital camera, the more problems with the photo.The best thing I ever did was take a photography class. Minimal cost, 4 or 5 evening classes, and I understood the trade offs between film speed, aperture and lens speed.

I'm also a big ol' noob (novice) when it comes to cameras, so please forgive my lack of concise terminology and limited experience with the camera's features.  That said, I suppose this review could be considered feedback from the general consumer.As the occasional and casual user, I was looking for a camera that would be compact, easy to use, would take great photos...basically a point-and-shoot camera for dummies.  The S210 actually packs a good bit of features into such a small camera and I found myself seduced by the price ($159 at the time of purchase), but I found myself getting lost in the multitudes of menus and settings.  I read most of the manual to try and familiarize myself with how this camera works and how best to use it, but many of the features were ones I probably would never use.I didn't care for the start-up.  It seems to take a bit longer than other cameras I've used, which made it a bit annoying when trying to catch a quick, random moment.  The power button is tiny and right next to the shutter button, so there were a few times when I meant to take a photo and ended up turning the camera off by accident.  I had a few choice words for myself and the camera in those instances.  Shutter speed also seemed a bit slow in comparison and I didn't like how unprotected the lens and its mechanisms were.  It would turn out I would have a good reason to worry.My husband and I took a trip to Playa del Carmen and when I took out the camera and turned it on, the lens only partially extended, retracted back into the camera and the screen said \"Lens Error\" and then promptly shut off.  I had used it a week prior to our vacation with no problems and when we traveled, I kept it in a hard case and carried it in my purse, so as not to crush or jumble it.  As anal retentive as I am, I can swear the camera stayed well protected and was not damaged during travel.  I also see that someone else has had the same problem.  After a few attempts of turning the camera on hoping whatever is stuck within the lens would correct itself, the cheap plastic pieces that make up the lens cover and the outer rim came loose and a sprinkling of plastic and tiny springs went falling to the floor.  I had had the camera less than 6 mos.I really wanted a camera while we were in Mexico, so we went to an office supply chain and I picked up a Fuji FinePix Z20fd.  I mainly chose it because the lens/shutter is protected by a door that slides open to turn the camera on.  After using the Fuji, it put things in perspective for me and I realized how much I didn't care for the Nikon.  The Fuji was more expensive, but it's much quicker in use and shutter speed, takes better photos with 10MP instead of 8MP, it seems/feels more substantial in the hand and seems to be better made all around.  Overall, I feel as though the S210 is trying to be a sophisticated little camera, but the cheap price meant they skimped on the materials.

So what do I need with a point and shoot?The answer is I don't. If I need a quick pic of something, there is always the camera in my iPhone 3G. But I recently got a chance to set up this little Nikon for my stepson and review his work. It was very impressive. The images were clear, focused, and sharp. The camera itself is about the same size but much thinner than a pack of smokes. This makes it easy to carry around in a shirt pocket when those photo moments arise. Given the consistently excellent results, what's not to like.Well what you get in miniaturization you give up in control. While most (and maybe all) DSLRs have electronic controls, they are loaded with manual overrides allowing the photographer to take control quickly. Going through menus whose common features are tiny icons is cumbersome. A 3X optical zoom is nice, but it offers no optical zoom for those who use them. Anti-shake technology is built in using Nikon's VR system found in its best cameras and lenses.I installed a 4GB SD card which stores far more than the camera can hold between charges. A one GB would be more than adequate but my stepson was going to Scotland for three weeks and wouldn't be taking his laptop. I wanted him to have the capacity to take lots of pictures, and he did, but came no where close to the 4GB card's potential.As to charging, we did have a bit of confusion about European voltage. After a bit of research on Nikon's web site I learned that voltage regulation is built into their chargers.This is not a professional camera.

Our 3rd died a few months ago after 14 months of use, and prompted me to at last write a review.  LENS ERRORS, without cause (not dropped, no sudden temperature changes, no foreign objects or water got in the camera, batteries were kept appropriately charged, and the like), have rendered all 3 cameras of this make/model unusable.All 3 cameras were used solely by 2 adults with 8 decades of photography experience between us.  Yes, we should have bought a different camera for our 3rd, not purchased another of these, but the size/portability (it is lightweight and a very handy size), and picture quality for the price, were hard to resist.The cameras did take good quality photos (once you read, read, read the manual and practice, practice, practice, practice with the various modes/settings - see other reviews below re this same issue), and have a terrific zoom, but THE LENS FACILITY FUNCTIONS EXTREMELY POORLY.

For video, considering what the camera is (a portable webcam), I'd give it 4 stars... Hence the 3 star rating.For a camera primarily designed for still pictures, the Coolpix camera does a decent job with video.  If you're a video blogger, or just want something small that can fit in your pocket, then the Coolpix camera might be for you.HOWEVER, if you're taking photos of anything other than stationary objects, you will find this camera to be quite frustrating.  There is a shutter lag of nearly two seconds, which is plenty of time for a moving object to leave the field of the viewfinder or change to an undesirable position.  I had hoped that disabling the flash (to get rid of the pre-flash) would eliminate this problem, and while there is a slight decrease in the delay, it's not enough to make a big difference.In addition, there are problems with the auto-focus.  It has some nice functions for focusing on faces, but if you like to take close-ups (as I do with my nature photography... with flowers and butterflies), you can expect your subject to be completely fuzzy and out of focus.  This is also a problem in low-light conditions with photos that aren't close-up.Sure, this camera can take some decent pictures, but if you want to take pictures at sporting events, animals, low light conditions and close-ups, DON'T GET THIS CAMERA!!!
