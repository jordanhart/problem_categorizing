I have a Canon 5D Mark II with many L lenses.  Due to having brokenthree vertebrae in two years, I needed a much lighter camera.  All my wonderful professional lenses will fit on this cameraand in some instances even provide an interesting result due to the 1:6 magnification factor of this Rebel T3i.  I am aCanon fan all the way!", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Carol", "ReviewID": "R26MESKHF6QND9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wish we would have read and realized this did not come with a lens!!
