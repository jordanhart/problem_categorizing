It produces gorgeous images with almost no effort, and is smaller than a disposable film camera.  The design is so completely intuitive, I didn't even look at the manual and was shooting pictures within two minutes of opening the box.It takes exceptional photos in low light even handheld.  Add a tripod, and the lowlight images are truly beautiful.  The redeye flash works great, and the variety of settings available to choose from make this much more than a point-and-shoot.  (Although leaving the setting on Auto gives consistently beautiful photos.)The macro setting is particularly good on this camera, with results that remind me of pictures taken with my expensive Nikon film camera.AVI movies too?  Wow, this is a great camera!It eats batteries with slightly less voracity than other digital cameras, and only uses TWO instead of four, so having a few spares is no trouble.  I am planning on purchasing the cradle and rechargables.Oh, and the zoom lens is wonderful.  You can even zoom while shooting AVI movies, which is unusual especially on such a small camera.The self-timer option is nice, too.The software is really easy to use, with nice features for tweaking your pictures.  I have found, however, that this camera's images rarely require any correction.Believe the hype that it takes 6 MP quality pictures with only 3.1MP.  I don't know how the Fuji folks did it, but they did.", "Date": "November 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great product for the money", "Author": "Benjamin Schooler", "ReviewID": "R2PT19EMSLE1OT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Fujifilm a310 for 3 weeks and I am amazed with it's performance.  I was considering getting the Canon elph s100, however after reading the article in Consumer reports I was convinced that the a303 was what I was looking for.  The a310 is newer than the a303.  I am a college student who does not have the money to spend n a pricey 4 or 5 megapxel camera, but needed an upgrade from my 1.3 MP olympus.My two key elements of criteria for purchasing my new camera was battery life and shot to shot recovery.  The a310 is excellent for both.I thought that getting a camera with AA batteries would leave me always having to replace them, but this camera has allowed me plenty of shots (around 200 so far), with the screen on and I still have yet to replace the batteries that came with the camera.  That also includes many movies that I took (no sound but still worth taking).The shot to shot recovery is great, about 3 seconds.  I can take a shot and then be ready for another almost instantly.  Also upon opening the lens the XD card does not need to be loaded at all, and the camera can take a picure as soon as the lens has loaded in the correct position.All this for over a hundred dollars in savings to cameras that perform equally if not worse.  The camera is small, cheap and takes great pictures.  If you have the money you should get a 4 or 5MP camera however if you want a 3MP camera look no further than the a310.", "Date": "December 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS THE BEST LITTLE CAMERA YOU CAN BUY!!", "Author": "flowergurl1", "ReviewID": "R1JDJDMZQHYXS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own an awesome Canon Rebel S2 camera (35mm) and needed a fit-me-in-a-pocket sleek digital camera with decent megapixels.  I saw this camera and bought - LOVE IT!  It shoots in 6 MEGAPIXELS! What Fuji did was they found a way to \"overlap\" the 3.1 megapixels onto eachother to creat 6 megapxls.I OWN IT FOR OVER 2 WEEKS NOW AND TESTED THE PHOTO QUALITY:Let me tell you the COLOR is 100% ACCURATE - TRUE TO LIFE COLOR which was my number 1 quality I was looking for (next to megapxl and clarity).I blew up one of the photos to 13\" x 18\"  and THE PICTURE IS CRYSTAL CLEAR, the picture was of me and my dog and you can see the finest hairs on my dog. NO PIXELATION WHATSOEVER!!!!  People were very impressed!!!!It's very compact.  The next best one is Canon S400.  See the complete reviews with test images at  [...]  .  For the money you can't beat it!Wait a year or two and then upgrade to a fancy 5 megapixel or by then 8 megapixel(which just came out for $1000).  Technology rapidly advances- in the meantime stick with this camera- you'll love it!!!Krissy", "Date": "March 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera, lightweight, and very easy to use!", "Author": "JDK", "ReviewID": "R2SXLLD67TV8O0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ever tried using an Olympus digital camera and wished it were a little easier to navigate the menu's?  Fuji digital cameras are the answer!I've tried Olympus' digital cameras before and must say the people who designed the menus and buttons were not thinking of the average camera user when designing it.This little A310 camera is nice.  It has an automatic sliding cover that covers the lens when the camera is turned off.The pictures it takes are great, as long as you are in Fine (3MP) mode.  1 and 2 MP modes are good too, but noticeably less than the 3MP.  Macro mode works excellent.  Colors are good.To compare it to an older Fuji Finepix 2400 camera- the 2400 would show mysterious white circles in the photos when taking pictures under low-battery conditions.  With the A310, I can take pictures until the batteries are on their last legs.The only real beef I have with this camera is that its movie mode does not allow sound via any type of built-in microphone.  You're stuck with silent movies.  This isn't a big deal me however, since I'm not into videotaping..", "Date": "December 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Pictures and Easy to Use!", "Author": "Vicki \"Diva Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R32L82840PQLB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a gift last Christmas.

My next camera was a FinePix 2300, which served me well and with which I have taken over 11,000 photos. Looking for something a little better, I next purchased an A310. This camera has never given me the sharp and clear pictures that I get with the 2300, and I have never been happy with the camera. I love the little xD picture cards and I really like the cradle, but I sure do not like the camera.

I got an excellent deal on the camera but because of it's image noise, the camera suited no purpose. I read the reviews regardin the noise, but assumed it was an exaggeration. It was no exaggeration. Do not purchase this camera if you are going to use it to take pictures (AKA: Don't buy this camera) The image noise and blurriness in pictures will disappoint you.  In my testing I compared the image noise of this camera to that of a Finepix 2650 (2MP), Nikon 2100 (2MP), and Canon Powershot A70 (3MP). In all these cases, the Finepix A310 faired far worse.
