{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera in a tough competition", "Author": "Eddy Poon", "ReviewID": "R1VA1K3JWCDVOT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Handling:  The interface is similar to that in other Canon digital compacts, which helps your learning curve.  The case is in metal, except the USB and the battery cover.  They are both made of plastic and feel very fragile.  The metal tripod mount is located closely below the lens.  The LCD screen is reasonably viewable under daylight conditions.Canon celebrated that SD300 is the first compact that uses the DIGIC II processing, and with my experience so far, the camera does respond faster when compared with DIGIC based ones.  It however appears to be on par with recent Sony and Olympics models.  I did not measured the various response times scientifically however.Picture quality: Contrary to other comments, I was not \"blown away\" by quality of the pictures.  The lens produces not serious, but significant purple edges in bright sunlight, and shows problems with dark corners like other compacts.  Color production is rich with high contrast, a big plus.  Sadly I find the pictures appear noisy when taking under low light conditions.  I suspect either I have a faulty unit, or there are some design issues?Complaints:* can't review picture histogram easily (two to three steps)* noisy operations* no battery level indicatorSo far I find the SD300 a good and decent pocket camera.  However in the same market (similar specs and price) there are many other choices, and the SD300 does not excel specifically in any area.-- UPDATE --I used this camera frequently between October 2004 and January 2005, taking more than a thousand pictures for my trips around.  I report more experiences I have with this fun camera:* The lithium battery is surprisingly resilient in cold conditions.  I bought a spare battery for my ski trips, thinking that batteries die early in cold weather.  It was negative teens and I had no trouble taking more than 50 pictures during the day with one battery.  Very good indeed.  The auto white balance worked fairly well - some blue casts.  Make sure you increase the exposure compensation when taking pictures with snow backgrounds.  (I use +2/3 to +1)* The purple fringe symptom has been widely reported and I guess users have to live with it.  Else the camera proved to be good at determining exposure and delivering pictures with good color contrast.* As a compact camera it served my purpose well: taking pictures of interesting things I see everyday in my life.  Small and quick.  I find it difficult however to use SD300 with my gloves.  This is no criticism as small cameras all have small buttons, but I still remember how painful my hands were when I needed to take off my gloves to shoot pictures in the mountains.", "Date": "October 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "For what it is, it's perfect!", "Author": "T. Nielsen", "ReviewID": "R2P9J51IVZVV3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, for anyone looking for a camera this tiny, you'd better understand that there will be compromises. Battery life, image quality, etc. This camera does not take pictures nearly as nice as my Powershot G5. I never expected it to.But for a super compact camera, it's absolutely amazing. Things that I really love:1) This camera is FAST. It starts up, and is ready to shoot, in about 1 second. My G5 takes about 3. In between pictures, you hardly have to wait at all. The new Digic 2 operating system is very snappy.2) The image quality, especially outside, is wonderful. There is some purple fringing that is common to a small lens, but you'll only see it where a bright edge meets a dark edge. And most of the time, it'll never appear.3) The movie mode ROCKS. Imagine, shooting 640x480 at 30fps with NO TIME LIMIT! I bought a 1 gig 66x SD card, and can shoot until the card is full. At full res, 1 gig will hold 8.5 minutes, which is actually pretty amazing considering this is a tiny compact camera. You can also shoot 60fps, for slow motion FX, but that is limited to 360x240.4) it's SMALL. Finally a camera that I can carry with me. It's about 30% thinner I think than the S400 S500 series cameras.5) Simplicity. Few buttons, and a very well laid out menu system. I never even cracked open the manual, no need. It's so easy to use.All in all, I'm very pleased with this camera, and would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a super-small camera that takes great pictures.Don't expect it to get great battery life, especially if you're shooting with the LCD and Flash all the time.This thing is SOOO cool.", "Date": "November 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "Which of the SDxxx Series is right for you?", "Author": "diljs", "ReviewID": "R30C6IKX22N20Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that Canon makes exceptional digital cameras; the best in the market right now. This is because they have always used high quality components since they began manufacturing digital cameras. This one is no exception.Now that I've sold you on a Canon, which one should you choose?First off, let's see if you really need an SDxxx camera, or would be better suited with a cheaper non ultraportable camera.The SDxxx Series offers several key advantages over less portable models:-Beautiful, sleek design and metallic body will wow anyone who sees it.-Gorgeous 2 inch LCD screens-The excellent Dig!c 2 processor (other Canons only have dig!c 1)-Much better movie mode than previous Canons-Small light, easy pocketabilityOn the other hand, there are some significant drawbacks due to the components Canon had to use to get the camera so small:-Few manual controls.-Pictures are not as sharp as those of similar non ultraportable cameras.-The flash is very close to the lens (lots of redeye problems)-More purple fringing issues than other Canons-Proprietary batteries that are expensive to replace-The LCD is very fragile. Read the SD200 and SD300 reviews to see lots of unhappy people whose LCDs broke. Canon's warranty does NOT cover this either. My suggestion? Buy using a credit card that offers a warranty in addition to the manufacturer's. If your lcd breaks, many CC companies will replace the camera no questions asked!If you don't need the ultra portability and flashy looks of the SD cameras, a slightly larger camera with more features might be right for you. I would highly suggest Canon's A510 or A520 if you don't need an SD model.If you still want an SD model, which one should you choose? The SD200 with 3.2mp, the SD300 with 4mp, the SD400 with 5mp, or the SD500 at a whopping 7.1mp?Your first instinct may be that more megapixels is better. Today, however megapixel ratings are similar to Ghz ratings in the computer world: They used to mean a lot, but they don't mean as much anymore. More megapixels do NOT mean a better image. They mean a larger printable image. Unless you have to have huge prints, you simply do not more megapixels. In fact, the 3.2mp of the SD200 is enough for anyone who doesn't plan on printing pictures larger than a standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper.That having been said, there are some differences between each SDxxx model. In order to get the larger 7.1mp sensor in the SD500, Canon had to make the camera larger. Thus, it is around a quarter inch thicker and 30% heavier than the other 3 models. The larger size did enable Canon to pack more features into it, however:Features unique to the SD500:-1/4 inch thicker-30% heavier-50% longer flash range-14% more battery lifeThe SD400 and SD500 also share these benefits over the SD200/SD300:-New \"Night Display\" feature which brightens the LCD in low light-My Colors feature lets you highlight or swap colors right on the camera-USB 2.0 High Speed supportThe following are shared by all the SDxxx Cameras:Pros:-Beautiful, eye catching design-Great image quality, though not as good as non ultraportable models-New Dig!c 2 image processor-Excellent Movie Mode-3x optical zoom is adequate for most people-Excellent, intuitive manual controls-Huge 2.0 inch lcd that looks great under various lighting conditions-Uses widely available and cheap SD cardsCons (most of these are minor quirks):-Some purple fringing problems-Proprietary batteries are expensive to replace and inconvenient at times-Lots of issues with fragile LCDs-No RAW support-Few manual controlsIf you do choose this product, the first thing you should buy is a larger SD memory card. The camera comes with a 16mb card (32 in the SD500), which is pretty much useless.You should also immediately purchase a case and some screen protectors to protect the LCD.", "Date": "April 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "3 weeks so far and loving it!", "Author": "Bradikal", "ReviewID": "RM70CRWTD9G7J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My priorities when shopping for a camera were:Small size, large screen, movie mode with sound, at least 3X optical zoom, good image quality.The SD 300 delivered on all counts.  It is really small- I know that Casio makes a thinner camera, but I have found the SD300 to be a great size when you don't want to lug something big around.The screen is large, (2\") for its size and has good resolution.I have recorded a couple of movie clips, and at low res I could conceivably record for almost an hour on the 512 meg SD card I got at Costco for $54.  The included 16 meg card really doesn't hold enough shots to be useful.The optical zoom is the standard 3X.  Like most people I shut off the digital zoom because I like my pictures to look good, not like garbage.  Don't digitally zoom, just optically zoom and crop the picture with photo editing software.I have loved the pics I've taken with this camera.  The colors and resolution looked great.  I find I often shoot using the \"children and pets\" mode for the high speed shutter, and turn off the flash.  Not that the flash is too much, except way up close when ANY camera would give blown out pics- I just prefer using natural light when I can, and the good low-light capabilities of the camera allow for it.As others have mentioned, a battery charge indicator to give advance notice the battery is going to poop out would be nice.  A camera this small can't have a large battery, so you have to be conservative.  I turn off the imaging beam, and that seems to make a big difference in extending battery life.  Another feature that I miss compared to my Olympus is a button that takes you directly to viewing mode.  I find that I blast back and forth between shooting mode and play mode to make sure I got the shot I wanted, and that slide switch isn't going to last forever.Overall I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a lot of features and quality in a small package.", "Date": "December 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Simply amazing.", "Author": "Toxicriptide", "ReviewID": "R1C2DUM12BXBX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is simply amazing. I suggest you buy this over any other camera on the ultracompact market.I really did my research to find this camera. I looked in about every place on the net that sells cameras, and I chose this one.Pros-ULTRACOMPACT-Huge LCD-Spectacular \"set-up\" photos, like portraits and closeups.-Great spontaneous photos, like quickies-Read/Write time (with the included sd) is AMAZING-Startup time is under 1 second (excellent)-Canon's photo manual is very helpful and nice-Included software is pretty darn good. (I'm sure you could find better, but I use it because of it's simplicity.)-Manual settings is very good for an ultracompact-Battery life is good, and it charges in 90 minutes-Switching from Photo to Review (and vice versa) is VERY fast-Excellent video mode for a camera of this caliberCons-No battery life meter (that I can tell)-Sort of flimsy av-out flapThe Pro's heavily outweigh the cons, no doubt.Overall, I would seriously recommend this camera to anyone who wants:1.

Woo", "ReviewID": "R2FGVZQZ4BBZDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a 4 megapixel camera that can do it all and also be super portable, the Canon SD300 is it.  My comments go double if you are considering the SD300 because of its very compact size.  When looking at its competitors, be sure to take into account the overall travel package including the battery charger, much like you would when deciding on portability of a laptop computer. For example, the Pentax Optio 4si and 5si cameras are about the same size and a touch lighter in weight, but they only come with bulky charging cradles that also need a bulky A/C cord. The SD300's charger, by contrast, is very compact; no bigger than the camera itself, and its plug swings out so you don't need any cord. The overall travel package of camera and charger is like carrying two tins of Altoids mints.  In fact, they will probably fit inside the tins.  Very portable.  The camera's performance is great. I considered, besides the Pentaxes, the Lumix FX7, the Sony T1 and Casio Z55, but I bought the Canon and am very satisfied with it, even though other cameras come in 5 mpxls whereas this one is 4 mpxls. Do I wish it had 5? Of course. But I find 4 mpxls is more than adequate for my needs and rarely if ever do I wish I had more.  You can easily go to 8x10 prints with 4 megapixels.", "Date": "December 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Tiny and Perfect", "Author": "jamescroak", "ReviewID": "R1GH308SVD3NAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fourth camera from the Canon Powershot line, I use the high end SLR Canons professionally but carry a small camera with me for that once-in-a-life time shot that might appear; typically I use one of the Canon Powershot line as the software is familiar to me and they're rugged.  I used the S40 for a year, the S50 for a month or so, and then the Powershot Pro1, all excellent cameras for their intentions.However, the SD300 will run rings around all of them, pointedly it has the instant on and instant auto-focus and immediate shooting that pros demand, but get only with the high-end SLR cameras, features that are sorely missing from the Powershot line.  The digital lag problem, typical in low end cameras, culminated in the Powershot Pro1 wherein the camera is un-useable for motion shots or in poor light (it's still-life capabilities are excellent though).  Now Canon has stuck their high end DIGIC processor and software in this cellphone-tiny Elph, since it has the same processor as the 20D, it feels closer to it in performance than it does to the rest of the Powershot line; indeed this is the first Powershot to have such a processor:  It shoots sport-photo fast, ie 5 frames at full resolution every two seconds with enough of a buffer to get a dozen or so shots before it slows down, each shot appears immediately on its large screen, another first.  It has an onscreen 9 point focusing (with green squares) that is user modifiable for the person-in-the-corner shot.  The flash is so good it should be an attachment:  shoots six different ways depending upon light conditions. My large hands had no trouble at all with the buttons, biggest problem I anticipate is forgetting its in my pocket and sending it through the laundry, its that thin!Now for the feature that none of the high end Canons have, including the multi-thousand dollar digital SLR line, and the other Powershots can only approximate:  a 60 fps movie mode, Holy Cow!  Shooting good quality slow motion movies with this credit-card-with-a-lens, what a hoot, it also shoots normal speed 30 fps for a 640x480 movies of surprising liquid-like evenness, there is no jerking even with rapidly moving objects.  So not only is it a stand by still camera, if you are a film maker who needs a light weight movie camera around for that once-in-a-lifetime scene stick this one in your wallet.

I am constantly buying new ones in the $300-500 price range and selling them on eBay once they've revealed their flaws to me. Without a doubt, this is the best one I've had and I think it'll stick around for a while. What's good about it:1. size and style are great; there is nothing that can be improved upon here;2. the LCD is a nice size without sacrificing the viewfinder;3. the controls are very easy to access and understand. Though I prefer the point-and-shoot method, I find myself dabbling with the controls a lot and I take better pictures because of it;4. the time it takes between opening the camera and taking a photo is almost instantaneous. There's no warmup period. Likewise, taking several pictures rapidly is a breeze, no lag time at all;5. in general, the camera is simple to use. Someone with no experience could pick this up and use immediately; and6. I wish more cameras would use plain ole AA batteries, but since that's probably never going to happen, Canon's li-on battery is adequate. It lasts a decent amount of time and charges very quickly. The charger is improved in this line from the S410, which was somewhat bigger and more awkward.And what I don't like:1. pictures indoors or after dusk just don't turn out that well, regardless of using the nighttime/indoor settings on the camera. I think that the flash is adequate but after all my digital camera trading, have found this to be a universal weakness. It's annoying;2. no meter for the battery. You get about five pictures once the indicator tells you the battery is on the way out. It's something a lot of people have complained about and doesn't seem like a tough thing for Canon to fix; and3. the software that comes with the camera is junk. I hate it. I recommend downloading Picasa, which is fabulous, and free.As for the LCD cracking, that really sucks and I hope it doesn't happen to me. The obvious answer is to pick up a case and cart it around in that. I haven't had any experience with redeye-no more than expected, anyway-or purple fringing.

I am convinced that the role of SLRs and regular film cameras are dead.  I did not use my SLR because it was big and bulky - this thing will sit in your pocket and not even be noticed.  Still functional easy to press buttons and use the camera.  Very happy.Camera Usability:I came from a previous Canon S45 - so I was familar the interface which really hasnt changed much in the last three years.  It has a 2 inch lcd which is very bright and nice to look at.  If you know canon - no need to read the book.  If you are new to canon - it is pretty intuitive - so again Very Happy.Camera Picture Quality:It is a 4MP camera and appears to take pictures every bit as good as my old canon s45.  Zoom is 3x and it comes with all the standard manual settings - including an underwater setting - which is pretty exciting - since I will be taking my camera to Hawaii in a couple of days and am interested to see how that works (apparently takes some of the blue out of the water to show the real colors of the aquatic life) - and yes I ordered the optional waterproof case. (Pretty expensive - but makes this very functional for beach, pool, snorkling and raining - NOT for scuba.) - Very happyCamera Speed:Shutter is pretty darn quick - easily as fast as my old Canon EOS Elan II - especially with the flash off - wow - very fast - and I am using standard Sandisk memory (Not the ULTRA stuff - which may even make it faster) - Unbelievably happyVideo QualityOK - This is what sold me on this guy - you can now take 640 x 480 resolution video on this little guy - pretty hard to believe. AND you can take unlimited up to the size of the memory card (so for a 1GB card that is about 9 minutes at the highest resolution).  This was one of my biggest wants on the s45 - you were limited to about 3 minutes and half the quality.  I have personally maxed out a 1GB standard Sandisk card with no problems  - pretty cool!  Unlike another reviewer I was able to not only play the video on my computer - I could do it from my hard drive or the card sitting in my card reader.  Video looked pretty good for something this small.  The other cool option was a 60 frame / second video option.  If you wanted to record sporting events (swing of the bat) this is pretty cool - you get 60 individual frames for each second of action - you capture everything. - Happy - and very cool.Battery / ChargingNot much to say here - have yet to put the camera through its paces - but the battery seems to do pretty well - and the charger is tiny to match the camera - nice for traveling.Overall - very cool - very fun and excited to have it!  My wife loves it - and she hates technology - she called it cute - and something she could shove in her purse - so it was a winner for her as well.  Only downsides might be their is no compression for video - so it burns through memory extremely quick -I will be back in a week after a hard week of taking pictures of water and waves and can update how she did when I get back!!*************UPDATE*****************OK - little slow to write my update - but have to say this thing is a champ.I took two SD cards on my trip - 1 1GB and 1 512MB.  I filled them both with pictures and video.  The battery was great - every time I used the camera - the battery lasted all day no problems.  Quality of the pictures was as expected.  Underwater case - worked great.  Underwater pictures were outstanding using the \"underwater\" mode on the camera (Takes out some of the blue).The video was great - I used all three modes (high quality, regular quality and internet quality).

I *am*, however, an enthusiatic amateur, who has taken pictures for 25 years, with a variety of cameras, including SLRs.  I am the proud owner of a Canon S230, Canon G1 and Canon G2.  We got the Canon S230 because it was very small and took VGA quality movies (ie, 640 x 320 movies), which look good on a TV screen.

Excellent macro -- 3cm!  This is better than the SD400 or SD5002.  DIGIC II processor really works well to quickly and  accurately get well focused images....way better than the previous DIGIC 1 processor.3.  Movie mode is excellent.  The length of the movie (with sound) is only limited by the SD care sizeWhat I did not like:1.  Poor flash.

Another added bonus was the size and ease of portability.  Movie mode is great, but will eat up your memory card.  Go for the 1G card if you want to take a lot of footage.  Size and weight were a major concern for me and this does not disappoint.  It will fit in the palm of your hand, yet is light and offers the benefits a large screen.A couple of small downsides include getting used to the focus with this camera, particularly for long distance shots and figuring out which mode will accomplish this task best.  Sometimes having too many modes is almost a hassle.  It also would be great if this camera had a slightly better way to review the most recent picture, but eventually you'll get it.  The other twist is the lack of a battery monitor.  Keep an extra battery on hand because once the indicator comes up you have about five pics left.I also picked up the accessory pack with an extra battery.  I managed to use the two batteries to take mearly 300 pictures and didn't have to charge over a 9 day vacation.  The camera is tough to get out of the holder when on a belt unless there's a strap on the camera.Quality of prints seems to be excellet.  Included software is ok.Have not experienced any of the cracked screens or error messages other users have reported, but did experience a bit of the condensation problem when going from cold to warm climates.

It takes very nice pictures. The LCD screen is nice and bright, but beware - it scratches easily. The pictures don't seem as vivid as they did with the Pentax, but they could be considered more realistic with the Canon. The time difference between pushing the shutter button and the picture being taken is much shorter on the Canon.My only beef that I have is that the 'auto' mode doesn't let me change two settings that I like to tweak.The first one is the auto-focus selection. The camera focuses on what it 'thinks' you want to focus on (of multiple focus points). It does provide an indication of what it selected. But, you have no way of overriding that in auto mode. You must switch to one of the other modes for that override capability.The other is the ability to force the flash to turn on, which I use often outdoors for fill-flash. You cannot force the flash on in 'auto' mode. Yet again, you must get out of auto mode to change this setting. You can force the flash to stay off in auto mode, but not force it to go on.This is a nice camera to take along when you don't want to carry your larger SLR.

I bought my camera less than 3 weeks ago and was extremely happy with it. It is light-weight, beautifully designed and takes great pictures. Then the other day, my LCD mysteriously cracked! It was always in my purse and I have it safely tucked in a thick camera case so I dont know how that could have happened. I never dropped, banged or abused it in any way. There was not a single scratch on the exterior of the camera so I dont know how the LCd could have been damaged. (The Canon representative I talked to said it may have been exposed to extreme heat or cold which causes damage to the LCD. But I never kept it in any place over a normal room temperature.) I just turned it on and a white screen with purple jagged lines appeared on the LCD. And all this happened 2 days before I was suppose to leave for my vacation to Hong Kong, which was the main reason I bought the camera in the first place. Very disappointing!! Fortunately, the online store I bought it from is willing to exhange the camera for a brand new one.

I took a chance on buying the Pentax this year, becuase I didn't know much about the quality of the photos of this brand. The Pentax S4i is fantastic for it's size, weight, and large LCD screen. BUT, for picture quality Pentax S4i is only good when you take pictures outside or have a lot of light in the room. If there is even the slightest lack of light, the grain is easily apparent. It's like looking at a picture with sand on it.With Canon, it doesn't grain as easily as Pentax. When it does have grain, it's smoother - less noticable (not sandy like Pentax).  The picture quality is better than before. The flash is noticably more powerful. And no more long lag times in snapping a photo, which was a problem from previous Elphs. Previous Elphs every now and then took it's sweet time trying to focus in-and-out before it feels ready to take the picture.The size is slightly smaller than the Pentax S4i, which is amazing to me. It's not as light as Pentax, but I don't mind it a bit (whatever makes the photo better). Lastly another significant change is that Canon finally uses the SD Memory Card instead of the Compact Flash (which processes faster than the usual Compact Flash).Overall, it is the best point-and-shoot digital camera I found that's out there.  If you want to protect this camera, buy a very padded case (you'll be glad you did). When I had the Pentax at first, I was lucky to find this light blue/gray Samsonite case that I found at Target that fits the camera perfectly and is very padded (without being huge).

I read all of the reviews about the cracked LCD screens and all, but i took my chances anyways...and quite frankly, the screen itself has taken a beating from me, it's all scratched up from being in my pocket, banging around with my keys and coins, etc.  i applied a thin screen protector and it fixes the cosmetic blemishes (and added scratch glare from sunlight) due to the scratches.  picture quality is awesome, i've made large prints at costco and they look immaculate.

The small size could be a drawback for those with large hands or arthritis, but as I have standard size female hands the small size does not affect my use of the camera (my brother also owns this camera and does not have any problems with size).2. QUALITY OF PICTURES - the overall quality of my pictures has been really good.  The camera has a flashing orange light which flashes after the shutter is pressed and before it closes if the camera was not held relatively steady while the shutter was pressed. While using the action mode, all my pictures have been clear.  I have not experienced any of the weird purple shadows that other reviews mention.3. USE - this camera is very easy to use.  Basically point and shoot. Changing between modes is easy once you figure it out (reading the manual is a good idea).4. DOWNLOADING - once pictures are on the camera, it is very easy to download them to the computer (install the software first)  just plug-in and follow the steps.5. BATTERY - I have not used this camera for extended periods of time, but for just plain old regular use the battery works great.I really love my SD300.

I frankly do not believe the LCD breaks by itself, but since there is no protection on it, simply grabbing it a little hard seems like it could damage the display.I want to thank all the previous reviewers that made me aware of this issue. There are many other cameras that have unprotected LCD's too, not just Cannon's. However, there are also many that protect them with a plastic or glass cover.I'm trading the SD300 in for the Casio Z55 which is the same size, lighter in weight, 5 Megapixels and equivalent functionality.

However, and this is entirely my fault, over the years, I haven't always used the best protection that I could have for my camera, thus resulting in some obvious LCD scratches. But I put that blame on myself, not the product itself.This camera has definitely taken some sharp, vivid, and beautiful pictures over the years. Even my professional photography family members acclaim some of my pictures. And here you thought it was JUST a snapshot camera...The compact size is great, and I always continue to find amusing places where this camera can fit: jean pockets, cell phone cases, my polo shirt's little itsy bitsy pocket, ...The thing that bugs the heck out of me is that, right after I had bought this, like a month or two later, newer and supposedly better models of the PowerShot line started coming out. I bought this baby for $400 dollars, so you imagine my dismay. Regardless, I'm not feeling regretful all too much because this is quite the well-made product.The one con (of the very few) that I can think of about this product is that, over time, my camera (when the lens would retract itself) a noise that I'm sure didn't appear before now does. I don't know if it's the product, or if it was just those times that I brought this baby to the beach only to have sand kick at it, but yeah, just an observation.Oh yeah, I also find myself charging the battery for this camera MUCH more often now. I don't know if age, wear and tear, or whatever has to do with anything, but charging this camera before some event is a MUST for me.

I have the Powershot S300 and anyone who owns a Canon camera knows the great quality of pictures their cameras take.  Even with just 2.1 mexapixels, I was able to take some really incredible photos.  My only complaints were that the screen size was too small,  you could only record for like 10 secs. of video at high quality no matter how big your CF card was,  and I was in the need for a camera with some more megapixels cause I want to get the new Canon i9900 printer that can make up to 13X19 borderless prints.  I was thinking about maybe getting the Sony Cybershot DSCW1 cause it has the features I was looking for but I read some bad reviews about the fuzzy and dark pictures that it takes,  and I really didn't want to stray from Canon cause of how happy I've been with their products.  So now they came up with the Powershot SD300.  It has 4.0 megapixels,  a huge 2\" LCD screen, and high quality video that can record at 640X480 at 30fps or 320X240 at 60fps for up to 3min. which is plenty of time for me.
