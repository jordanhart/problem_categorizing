{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good value.", "Author": "hobbyist-2006", "ReviewID": "R1685NKOT6UITF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera produces very good pictures when you keep to ISO 400 and below. You can make good prints up to 7-inch and some awesome wallpapers for your computer screen, especialy when you like to shoot in macro mode. Higher than this and it will display noise in your photos, as you would expect from a point and shoot of this kind.The controls are intuitive, with easy access to Program, Auto and Scene Modes. In Program mode, you can also manually access ISO selection, exposure compensation and white balance without much fuss. You can set a histogram to show up during review or playback. I realize these are features that one would expect to find in a DSLR. So it's a pleasant surprise to discover them in the A800! They provide some level of fine-tuning for the more advanced user. And for those who take their time to compose a shot, careful use of these \"advanced\" features will reward you with delightful images.If you are looking for a credit-card type camera, this isn't the one for you. It's about the size of a stack of cards. It's not your feather-light camera either since it takes two AA batteries adding heft. On the other hand, the heftiness gives an impression that it's stable and solid to hold. The camera is also very frugal on batteries. I am still shooting with the free AA-alkalines that came with it and have already taken dozens of photos and video clips.For the price, this one's a great value. I got a free 2GB SD card as well as two 2000mAHr Energizer NiMH Batteries and Charger to go with it! If you're just looking for a simple, handy camera for vacations and for those inevitable snapshots and video clips on family gatherings, the Canon A800 will deliver good results without costing a fortune. Just use it within its limits and you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Replacement Camera", "Author": "R. Macy", "ReviewID": "R1NVJAZWFETGJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Canon replaced a powershot 490 that got left out in the rain one day. The A800 is decent and takes good pictures, but is a little slow on the flash recharge. What it does have are AA batteries which can be changed out in a heartbeat and not tied to a lithium power charger that takes forever, unless you want to spend another 30-35 dollars for a second battery. If I had the money I would of course buy a Canon EOS system but the A800 will do for now. I would not hesitate to recommend this camera as a standby for a professional photog. The 1200 series release was complicated by a lack of product delivery and most stores only got 1-2 in stock during late March and they sold out quickly. If you want, you can compare the A800 & 1200 for yourself. Remember, do you want to stop taking photos during that special occasion because your battery is drained???", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Carol T.

After having more time to use it, I'm raising my rating to five stars because I like it so much. I still wish it came with easier software and instructions, but that has become less important to me.This is the first digital camera I've used, I've only been using it for a couple of weeks, and I didn't know what to expect from a $90 camera (I later noticed Amazon also offers it in black for $75). It seems a very good camera, but the non-intuitive software and often-confusing user guides make me give three stars instead of five. I write this for other beginners out there:Pros: It's very easy to use on \"Auto\" setting, and pictures look surprisingly clear and good even under different light conditions.  I like having other options besides \"Auto\". So far \"portrait\" and \"foliage\" have worked as they should. I haven't tried others enough yet to tell.  I like that it has a \"P\" (Program) mode that allows you to make a few changes to the aperture value (exposure compensation), shutter speed, pixel setting and compression ratio, etc.--in case I get more ambitious.  I like being able to take black and white or sepia photos by simply selecting to.  The video feature works very well, and I like being able to use the software to select individual frames to make into photos.  The batteries that came with the camera yielded about 60 photos (including lots of flashes) and lots of turning the camera on and off and experimenting with settings.  I like the size--not too small to handle easily, big enough to feel solid in my hands. I think the buttons might be hard for bigger hands, though.  I've had no problem at all with blurred photos (on Auto setting), even though my hands aren't always that steady when I'm taking a picture in a hurry.  Customer service techs are easy to reach, courteous and smart.Cons:  The software seems too complicated (and I'm good at figuring things out). Even the customer service techs had trouble navigating it, though they were very knowledgeable about camera and printer matters.  The online user guides for both the camera and the software could explain things more clearly and thoroughly. They're short on words, and many pages refer you to other pages. Also, I think I'd rather have less options and less ways to do the same thing. And I still haven't figured out how to sort my photos into folders and retrieve them easily.  The soft plastic cover over the terminal where you connect the camera to your computer doesn't feel securely connected. Maybe it's OK, but I have a feeling it's going to fall out long before the camera dies.  I didn't realize I'd need to buy a memory card separately. This may be standard practice, but I think some digital cameras do come with a 2G memory card to get you started.I haven't tried the video function yet.In case other beginner's run into this problem (not unique to this camera): my photos printed out very faded until I figured out that I needed to select \"print without borders\". Or, when printing through Windows Vista with a Canon iP2600 I had to uncheck \"borderless\". (The sequence is Print, Properties, Page Setup, then look for the box next to \"borderless\" and make sure it's not checked.) I don't know yet how this will affect text printing.I'm glad I bought this camera, and maybe I'll raise my rating after I've used it for awhile.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Nelson Scharf \"Rick S.\"", "ReviewID": "R21EBIT39ET7BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You cannot beat this camera for the price. It takes great pictures, it's very easy to use and small enough to carry in your pocket. I was reading a review that said, \"had I known it used batteries, I wouldn't have purchased it\"...well let me answer that. My wife has a higher priced camera that has to be charged each time that you use it, several times she's forgotten to charge her camera and lost some really great pictures. That will not happen with this camera. I keep a spare pair of batteries in my case, so I never have to worry about that happening.If you want an excellent camera for a reasonable price, then you can't go wrong purchasing this camera. I was worried when I ordered it because of the low price, but so surprised at how nice this camera turned out to be.

The only thing not intuitive for me is the \"fill flash\" option. I like to use flash when the auto detector does not require it, I have had a tough time finding it.All else is easy, nice Canon quality, and so far has survived a few drops to the ground from waist height. I assume I will have to duct tape the bottom latch when the plastic battery cover gives way, but I have had to do that with my old Nikon, my Kodak and my Olympus. They all seem to favor plastic latches and releases.I am pleased with the quality of the images, and THRILLED that the zoom does not allow my husband to try to do too much with the zoom feature (more optical zoom is NOT better - any camera that claims so is falsely advertising). In the past the 20X, etc optical zoom claims of other cameras has led my non-photographer savvy husband to be disappointed with the fuzzy images he got when using those \"features\". Keep it simple.

It takes so-so pictures which (even though it is rated at 10 megapixels) are not as sharp as those with my Canon A540.  Perhaps the poorer resolution is due to the lack of a viewfinder and certainly in part because of the lack of software to correct for shaking.
