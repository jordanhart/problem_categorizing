I purchased the Fuji for my Dad (87yr old) who's not the best at being stable.  The ease of use and having buttons large enough for him to use plus (A MAJOR PLUS) is the stability feature.  No more fuzzy shots from his shaking.  He is very happy with his new camera and the clear photos it produces.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Resolution 12.2 Megapixel   Digital Zoom 5.7 x  Zoom lens - 5.7 mm - 17.1 mm - f/2.9-5.2\nBuilt-in flash\nShooting Programs Landscape, portrait mode, night mode, text, party/indoor, fireworks, panorama assist, flower, sports mode, sunset, beach, night (tripod), natural light, snow, baby, anti-blur\nLight Sensitivity ISO 100, ISO 800, ISO 400, ISO 200, ISO 1600, ISO auto\nVideo Capture AVI - 320 x 240 - 30 fps \u00a6 AVI - 640 x 480 - 30 fps", "Name": "FUJIFILM FinePix AX230 12MP 5X Zoom HD Movie mode Digital Camera - Red", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519ZORdiXBL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004JME5BA"}}
