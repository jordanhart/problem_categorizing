Q-See does not test the item before they put their name on it. I saw suggested price online @120 which is way over priced. I think other products like Wansview, EASYN or FOSCOM are far better than this..", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "garbage", "Author": "Ian", "ReviewID": "R2WIC5RUDP321E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been through tech support twice on this camera. Initially it works fine and then the wireless craps out. Happened on 2 different cameras with many different variables removed (ie routers, modems etc). It worked great...when it still worked.

Broken, Broken, Broken software.", "Author": "David Jeske \"tech savvy\"", "ReviewID": "R24UQK1QWZ2K63", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is absolute junk. I am a computer engineer, and I gave up trying to install it because of how badly implemented the product firmware and included software are. Do not buy.The included CMS (camera management software?) is Broken and does not work at all. Clicking on things does nothing, it has repaint problems, and then it crashes. You can't actually DO anything with it, at least not on my windows7 machine.The camera FIRMWARE is horribly designed. Apparently the only way to configure it is through an ActiveX control which is unsigned and Windows 7 will not install, even after tweaking IE settings as explained in their manual. There is NO REASON to require ActiveX to configure. Every modern networked device under the sun has a plain-old HTML/HTTP UI which any browser can display to configure. Their engineers/contractors should be fired for using ActiveX needlessly. I talked to support, asking them if there was a way to configure without ActiveX (since this is a requirement for me anyhow), and they couldn't answer, and sent me to another department to sit on hold.This was all after dealing with the fact that the camera doesn't use standard DHCP config out of the box, so you have to use some arcane process to switch your IP, just to switch the camera IP. (this was easy for me, but wouldn't be for less technical users).With the broken-ness of both of these pieces of software related to the camera, I couldn't get enough information to try and configure it into a 3rd party package like Blue Iris. Based on the quality of the two pieces of software from them so far, I'm not interested in running their software on any of my machines, windows, iphone, or android, and so if I can't easily use 3rd party software, this this is a waste.Save yourself the trouble and buy something else that has a standard HTML/HTTP browser configuration with NO ACTIVEX.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor Technical Support", "Author": "Xytsrm", "ReviewID": "R35MH9A0BM76SD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been able to connect the QSTC201 model into my network, however its no thanks to the incompetent Q-See (Digital Peripheral Solutions, Inc) customer service.  The incomplete user's manual is poorly written, and in many cases, either misleading, or wrong.I was fortunate to get in contact with one of their technical reps when first having difficulty connecting the camera to my network - his suggestion failed.  On my own I directly connected the camera to my PC, reconfigured the local-network connection to be compatible with the camera and was finally able to re-configure the camera to be compatible with my network.I had a simple question regarding the Alarm In/Out, and waited for 20 minutes and was still unable to again get in contact with their technical support.  After sending a comment about the poor customer support to \"Contact a Manager\", I received an email response from Chris.  After several days of trying to get a reply from Chris, and threatening to send another message to the Manager, I received a reply and we spoke by phone.  Chris was unable to help me and suggested I send him an email with my specific questions and he would pass it on to their technical support - I did that on 13-Jan-2011 and I'm still waiting for a reply.My contacts with Q-See have made it clear to me that they are simply a RESELLER of products made in China, and like many resellers they neither write the manuals nor understand the product they resell.While, as I said I have been able to get the camera functioning, it has poor low-light sensitivity without the IR illumination (my existing TrendNet cameras have much better low-light sensitivity), even when turned off the IR Led's flash at a low level that can be noticed reflecting off the window back into the camera.Given the poor manual (many figures are illegible), and poor (read almost non-existent technical support) I am returning this camera.  There are many other cameras, with similar features available - and one can only hope that have better technical support.  I will probably end up with a TrendNet camera, although it's more expensive, they do have good technical support.UPDATE: 9-Feb-2011 - Although it's academic as I returned the camera, it's been 24 days and I'm still waiting for a response to my email.  (If they haven't responded by now it's not likely they will, or probably ever intended to)", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Zatoli", "ReviewID": "R1O63BOHUFGKKN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We've had this camera running for about a year now as the baby monitor and I'm very happy with it.  My wife and I have iPhones as well as an iPad and laptops all over the place.  The ability to view the video feed on any of those devices (from inside and outside the house) is fantastic.  The set-up requires a little bit of network configuration know-how since it can involve a static IP address and opening router ports.  It's pretty reliable in that it runs for months without glitches.  Only small ding would be on video quality but it's a low resolution feed so don't have too high of expectations.  We're using the SuperCam app from the AppStore to access the camera on our iOS devices and have been happy with their updates and offered functionality.  Overall, it's a good product for the price and features you get.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a baby monitor that wants to avoid paying $200+.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002N8A0N4"}}
