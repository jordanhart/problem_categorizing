Hayes", "ReviewID": "R2XBL6YF8OGRC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this camera for a few hours, but I had to rush to give an initial impression.  In one word, WOW!  For a compact point and shoot, Sony has the market leader.  First the photos....  Very good.  For a point and shoot camera, I can say that the photo quality is as good as most of my previous canon point and shoot cameras.  The photos have good color saturation and clarity and focus, and there is little shutter lag.  Now video......  AMAZING.  This little camera has as good video quality as my Sony CX-12 AVCHD video camera.  The video is sharp, clear and the sound is excellent.  The difference is this finally combines a decent camera with excellent video capability.  Another great feature is the wide angle lens, it gets the whole shot it without needing to back up.  I was unlikely to tote my video camera on every trip, but now I don't have to be concerned about pocketability.  The only downside is that because of the small form factor, camera shake can be an issue.  The OIS steadyshot is good, but could be better.  Also, you cannot make changes to settings while shooting, such as increasing the exposure, you have to stop shooting and then make the change.  Overall, those are small prices to pay for such a compact camera that I can take anywhere and play videos on my 55\" LCD that are jawdroppingly good.For comparison:I am currently using a Panasonic ZS3, which had average photos but very good video.  To me it can't compete with the Sony.  The Sony has better photos and much crisper video (both use AVCHD, although the Panasonic uses AVCHD lite).  I recently bought and returned the Canon SD4500IS.  I went back and compared photos between the canon and the Sony.  Both are close, but the edge goes to canon for clarity (although the Sony does handle white balance better in the auto setting).  Where the Canon failed was in the Video:  No wide angle lense, and the quality was below that of the Panasonic ZS3, very grainy and fuzzy.UPDATEAfter playing with this camera for about 8 hours I am quite impressed with the image quality from photos and the video remains stellar.  In comparing to the Sony WX5 (which I also have at the moment) the video is slightly softer, but the TX9 handles camera shake better, picks up sound more accurately with the mic on the front rather than the top, and does not have zooming noise from the lens moving while shooting video.  Taking photos, this thing blows away my Panasonic ZS3:  Photos are constantly clear and vivid and the white balance is spot on.  Shooting outdoors or in a room with adequate light, the shot to shot times are excellent.  The only downside I see to this camera is the shot to shot times when using the flash.  It takes at least 3-4 seconds to take another picture with a flash, due to the charge cycle on the flash.  It also seems to take the camera a bit longer to process the image after a flash, so that adds time.  I will say the photo quality with the flash is astonishingly good.  When using the ZS3, it was hit or miss on flash photos (either white balance was off or the photo was overexposed), with the TX9, just about every flash photo looks great.  Overall, this is a great camera that takes excellent video and photos.  I forgot to mention one great feature is the intelligent auto which picks the scene automatically for each shot, so far every picture I have taken (which is close to 400) has been very accurate with little post processing required.UPDATE 2Took the TX9 on a trip to Disney and it performed without flaw.  Took close to 700 pictures and a little over an hour of video.  Of all of the pictures that were taken, I'd say maybe 2 dozen would have been tossed, the rest turned out very nice with excellent color, sharpness and saturation.  The video taken on 17M FH setting are stunning.  I have no need for my Sony CX12 video camera anymore since this camera is ultra portable.  One reviewer noted a significant fisheye effect because of the wide angle lense.  I will say if you look for it you may see a slight effect, but I have not seen it very often.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Get the TX7 instead", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R2IUP9RQPI7YZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used the TX9 on my Cabo vacation and it is hands down the best camera I have ever owned. It's panoramic pics are breathtaking and the 1080i video is eye poppingly good.But the TX7 is very similar, the main 2 differences are 1. that the TX9 has an extra 3D mode which is gimmicky, it looks like crap and so I don't use it and 2. The sensor is 1/2.4 instead of 1/2.3 which translates to virtually no difference in quality (yes there are more pixels). Save yourself the $100 and get the TX7.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "iSweep App Review", "Author": "Lucas", "ReviewID": "R10B7H4Y85XR0O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TX9 comes with no memory card, but it does accept SDHC cards formatted to FAT32. With the 32GB card it the camera predicts that I can take around 6000 photos in 12M Pixels.The touchscreen is not bad looking, it is reflective like the Ipod screen which makes image looks clear but at the same time it is also more prone to glare. The touch screen is resistive, not as responsive as the capacitive screen we are used to with the iDevices. This is conform by the fact that it came with a slim plastic dog tag looking contraption with a pointy end. My girlfriend ask what it was, we were puzzled until I went to read the manual... apparently it is a stylus. Only resistive screen can use random plastic object as stylus.Besides the camera, the package came with a small docking station and a battery charger. This is a nice touch apart from the fact that is doesn't come will all the accessories for the docking station to fully function. It needs a separate AC adapter with Sony's own proprietary plugs which cost no less than $39.99 from Sony's website. Model AC-LS5, I included this, because I personally had a hard time finding this oddball adapter. The docking station has a HDMI and a AV connector, the package only comes with the RCA cable, so again you need to buy your own HDMI cable. I ordered the Amazon Basic ones, since Best Buy loves to insanely overprice these HDMI cable after Circuit City disappeared. With the HDMI cable, the TV out function is very nice. The picture displayed on the screen is amaziningly sharp and clear in 1080i HD and you won't need to bring a computer to show your photos to your friends on HD Television. On the down side you will not be able to recharge your camera on the docking station if you don't buy their AC adapter. Personally I find this really inconvenient. Update: I purchased the adapter, and it does not seem to  recharge the camera's battery.The basic modes of Photo on the Tx9 is Intelligent Auto Adjustment and Superior Auto Adjustment. The Intelligent Auto adjustment is the classic point and click and forget mode, the new superior mode take multiple photos at once then process it to improve picture quality. This does create noticeable clarity, but it needs around 5 second delay after each photo for processing. So this is not so useful if you have impatient friends that wants you to snap quickly.There are only a few buttoms on the camera, as most of the controls can be done on the touchscreen, the physical buttoms are there for fast access. Photo Mode, Video mode, Shutter, power, zoom and thats it. There are some primitive editing tools on the camera but they seem way too simple to be useful on a small resistive screen. It is more of a gimmick.There are 2 3D modes, the sweep panorama 3D photo which requires you to have a 3D TV to view and the Sweep multi Angle Mode which appears to changes prespective on the screen when you tilt the camera, similar to a holographic sticker. Since it depends on you to accurately perform the sweeping motion to get good photos, most of the time the 3D photo don't look correct. I also did not find a way to view the Multi Angle Mode photos outside of the camera.The photos are automatically organized onto a calender very similar to the way Nintendo DS does it. I found this to be a nice feature. The include photo software for the PC was not so useful, it decided to scan all the photo's from my other drives on the computer instead of just the camera, which made a mess of things.All the previous function are there, iSweep panorama,auto shutter on smiley face, etc, but unlike the TX5, the TX9 is not waterproof. I found it funny that Sony would called their trademark feature \"iSweep\" panorama. Without knowing the facts, if you have to guess which device the feature \"iSweep\" came from, Apple or Sony, which would you guess?All in all the strongest Pro on this camera is the point and click photo quality. It can do 1080 HD movies, but it's not the best of quality, however it is very good for it's compact size (The sound seems to be too loud when recording movies). On the down side, it doesn't include everything you want right out of the box, it only includes what you need, (minus the memory card) and buying Sony proprietary accessories isn't cheap.Update:I don't have a 3DTV but I found a zero cost alternative for viewing the 3D pictures on your computer, at least for novelty purpose. Is the use of Nvidia 3d Vision. You just need a blue and red anaglyph glasses (came free with a one of the issues of maxim) and Nvidia 3D translate the photos for you into 3D. Note that at the time of writing, this does yet work the Nvidia release drivers, it only works with the Beta video drivers, which probably would've already been released by the time people read this.Even if you were going for the more expensive 3d option from Nvidia (with 3D vision kit kit + 120hz monitor) it is still marginally cheaper than buying a 3DTV, plus it has the added option of playing games in 3D. But the main attraction for me was being able to view the 3D photos from the TX9 at almost zero cost, as long as you already have a PC computer with a nvidia gfx card.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazed at how much is packed into this size camera", "Author": "40somethingDad", "ReviewID": "R39BR7SONEA92K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has turned me into a total geek after just a few days of use. My friends and family are tired of me showing them pictures and talking about my new camera. I am not one to easily fall in love with a product, but I'm in deep lust with the TX9 so far.The camera functionality is a little confusing at first because there are so many options, but then I came to realize that if I just leave in the automatic it does a great job on its own selecting the best mode for the shot. Plus after just a few minutes of really playing with it, the functionality and features started to become very intuitive and make a lot more sense (e.g. switching from playback to camera to video with just one button).It's been 5 years since my last digital camera purchase, so perhaps some of the features/results I'm wowed by are now pretty common place, but to me they still are amazing. The most obvious difference from my old camera to my new is the ability to capture action shots. Please look at the shots I uploaded to the product gallery (canon fire and girl jumping into pool) to see how the camera allows you to make good-quality still images from the full 1080 HD video and high-quality images in 'burst' mode. Those two features alone make me happy I bought this camera. I never was able to capture such action before.The regular photo mode is fool-proof. Just point and click and 90% of the time your image quality is going to be top-notch no matter the lighting or scene. You do have the option to select certain modes like \"beach\" or \"twilight\" but I haven't seen a noticeable difference from the automatic mode. There's even and underwater mode which I haven't a clue how that's useful. One problem I had initially is that my finger would sometimes get into frame. It took me a few days to learn to hold the camera different so my finger wouldn't end up in frame.The camera also touts 3D capabilities, but I have no use for that technology yet. Perhaps it will be practical one day for me, but for now it's just a sorta cool extra that I have no way to view outside the camera. In other words, don't buy it for this feature alone unless you have a clear plan on what you need it for.Pros:Full HD video is beautiful and sounds greatImage quality (12.2 MP) consistently delivers vibrant, beautiful photosLow-light shooting is far, far better than I have experienced from older camerasAutomatic mode is very intelligentFeatures are easy to useHuge display screen (note: I had very little trouble viewing subjects even in bright sunlight)Size and weight make it easy to tuck into your pocketCons:Battery goes pretty quick (I was able to get a full day of shooting and video on a family trip but had to recharge before uploading images to computer)File sizes are huge (ballpark 500MB for a 30-second HD video and 4-5MB per image) and will really eat up space on your memory card and your computer. You will probably need a long-range storage plan like an external hard drive or something.The power cord for the dock costs extra ($40). I chose to buy and extra battery.Uploading your media to a Mac has been a little confusing so far. I somehow uploaded my photos twice at one time into iPhoto causing a management headache. I'm sure I'll get the hang of it, but it's not as intuitive as my old camera. Video is uploaded to iMovie not iPhoto.OverallDespite some minor annoyances and unanticipated extra expenses (cost of high-capacity memory card, extra battery and eventually more computer storage), I am thrilled with this camera. The functionality, results and compactness make this a worthwhile purchase. I will be able to capture many family memories with this for years to come.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera in low light settings", "Author": "JT", "ReviewID": "R1IKOZDTF8LGXE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We currently own a Sony HDR CX12 camcorder. It takes excellent 1080i AVCHD videos as well as good still photos (but only in good lighting). Most of its indoor shots and low light outdoor shots are disapointingly out of focus. After doing some resesarch, I narrowed our choices down to Sony TX9, alpha 55 DSLR, or alpha NEX-5. My primary goal is to have a camera that can take 1080i AVCHD video as well as still photos, particulary in the low light setting. Most of our pictures are of our children and family events.I decided to buy a TX9 becuase of its low-light picture capability. After using it for about 1 month now, I'm very happy to report that my indoor low light still photos are great and in focus. I have it set on the Superior Auto Adjustment mode most of the time. It takes 6 pictures rapidly (if necessary) and combines them to give you the best result. With this mode on and the flash turned off, pictures in low light settings almost always come out great and in focus. There is some fishbowl effect occassionally, but not noticeable to my eyes. This camera also has a large and bright LCD display which allows you to easily tell if your subject is in focus. There are very few buttons on this camera as most features are activated via its touch screen LCD.The TX9 also takes excellent 1080i AVCHD videos (but its audio is 2 channel stereo, not 5.1 digital like the CX12). It takes some practice to hold the camera steady for video shots (when compared to a camcorder like CX12) due to its small size. Its video quality is so good that I won't be needing my CX12 any further for home videos. The 4X zoom is more limiting when compared to the 10x zoom I was used to in the CX12 camcorder, but transitioning to 4X zoom was easier than I thought.I was able to compare the TX9 to my sister-in-law's Sony alpha 55 DSLR; both take great shots; but portability was much more important to me, so I decided to keep the TX9.I did purchase a seaparte spare battery as others have reported that it does not last as long. A spare battery actually makes sense as this camera cannot charge its battery when it is inside the camera. It requires you to charge the battery outside of the camera via a small wall charger. Overall, I'm ecstatic that I finally found a small portable camera capabile of taking great HD videos as well as great still photos in low light settings. If it wasn't for the zoom, limited to 4x optical, I would have given it a 5 star rating.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Short & to the point: SUPERB pocket / purse camera", "Author": "Nathaniel Allen", "ReviewID": "RYA9EDXOAYHL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera isn't the be-all, end-all of point and shoot photography. No, it makes some compromises with its small sensor, slow lens, and below average battery life. So why the TX9 for me? (actually, more for my wife...) + Excellent no-flash low-light / indoor performance, aka \"party shots\" or \"friends out to dinner.\" It achieves this by taking multiple shots at high shutter speeds in succession, avoiding motion blurring, then stitching them together. And it really works, as long as you get the shot right in the camera and don't try to lighten it in post processing (or then you'll see the lack of detail and empty zombie eyes). + Wonderful wide angle shooting, which is unheard of on cameras of this size. If you're unsure of this, TRUST ME, it's SOOOOO valuable in any number of situations, such as a group shot of friends in a small room (\"Everybody lean in!\") or capturing the kids or dogs up close without removing them from their environment, or capturing tall buildings and cityscapes in their whole. Wide angles add so much flexibility to the shot composition. + Excellent HD movie mode, with the press of a dedicated button. The picture quality is wonderful. Heck, watching it back on the large touch screen is excellent. Zooming while recording is silent. My only complaints are that the lens is very close to the edge, so we need to be careful of where our left fingers are if we're holding the camera with both hands or else they'll end up in the shot, and the stereo microphones are on the front face of the camera and so tend to pick up a lot of wind noise (other cameras place the mics on top). + Uses SDHC memory cards! Goodbye overpriced Sony Memory Stick and your pesky adapters! Hello, inexpensive and plentiful Class 6 SDHC. + The touchscreen is actually a joy to use. I was surprised. Seriously. (Though it does get filled up with fingerprints really fast!) The loss of the traditional mode dial made this camera instant best friends with my wife, who \"just wants to take pictures.\" And in full-auto mode, the camera does a very good job of selecting the appropriate shooting mode for the conditions. + Small! Thin! Portable! Doesn't need a case! This is the camera that I can truly \"always have with me.\" Slide the cover down and it's ready to shoot. + Panorama mode actually works. I don't mind stitching photos together in Photoshop -- in fact, from prior experience with the WX1, Photoshop is preferable in most instances -- but this is great for slapping something together in a pinch and is more than adequate for displaying on Facebook or emailing. + The docking base, while admittedly a little annoying to me, means the proprietary Sony cable doesn't get lost (oh, Sony, why can't you just embrace standard USB connections like everyone else?!?) -AND- no opening the slot to remove the SD card to stick it in the computer to upload pics.This camera is everything Sony's WX1 was supposed to be, except that it actually produces good photos in bright daylight (the WX1 fell flat on its face in these conditions, with awful washed out sky and blown highlights a'plenty). The dynamic range of the TX9 still isn't great, but it's better than any cell phone camera I've used. If we're headed somewhere where we know we'll be taking pictures, I'll reach for my Panasonic LX5 or FZ50, but for those spur of the moment opportunities where the kid is doing something irresistible or where we want to walk around unencumbered, the TX9 is turning out to be the perfect fit. And it's so small, it can live in my wife's purse without getting in her way.Due to the limited battery life, I picked up a spare Sony NPBN1 Rechargeable Battery which came in retail blister pack packaging and appears to be the genuine Sony product for a decent price.

I am viewing the 3D photos on the PS3's PlayMemories app.  You will need a 3D TV to view the 3D photos.  If you do not have one, this feature will be useless to you.Unfortunately, the 3D Sweep feature is very picky.  I have only gotten great results about 20% of the time.  Half the time the camera is unable to process the image.  The remaining 30% of the time, one of the objects (not moving) comes out blurry.But like I said, 20% of the time the pictures come out amazing.  The photos show true depth with no crosstalk.  Objects that are 50 feet away look 50 feet away.  And the objects that are close, look close.In sum, if you have the patience to use the 3D Sweep feature and you have a 3D TV, I would recommend this camera.

It does make good panoramic pictures in 3D, and quality of the high definition movies is good.The ONLY MAJOR BAD THING about this camera it has horrible FISHBOWL effect!Everything is stretched towards the corners and tilted towards the middle of the picture, so the buildings and trees look like Leaning Tower of Pisa - ready to fall. I will post some of these pictures on Amazon.I contacted SONY support, they recommended to reset camera to initial factory defaults - didn't help much,still making horribly distorted pictures, then they recommended to send camera to them.After searching the internet I found out that this is the bad design of this and previous Cyber-shot models and not a defect. I will not waste my time sending it back to SONY.I will simply return this camera to the store.Don't just take my word for it search internet for \"SONY TX9 FISHBOWL\"  you will find out that all TX7 and TX9 models have the same FISHBOWL issues due to wide angle lenses. This model is using the best German lenses and this should be an insult to Carl Zeiss brand to be used in such a bad SONY model.I'm extremely disappointed with SONY for creating this badly designed camera, I'm really surprised that SONY has Engineers and Testers on stuff who could design, test and approve the release of this camera to the market.After all if image distortion doesn't bother you and you don't mind guessing 5 years from now if the buildings behind you on the pictures are really falling and people are leaning against invisible walls or if this is just badly designed lenses than this is your camera.It doesn't worth $400.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good camera, but I'm a little disappointed", "Author": "nikki", "ReviewID": "R2SD7ENCSLAJZB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera mainly because of the background defocus feature. This seems to be the only compact digital camera with that feature. We were very disappointed because it takes a lot of testing--zooming in, out, plus photographer & object must both be completely still for it to work. That's nearly impossible to achieve when you're photographing little kids. When the background defocus does work (about 20% of the times that I tried), the object is not at all crisp, but soft. The other problem that I found with the camera is that you can use only ONE mode at a time! So you cannot use the anti-blur + landscape for example. That's certainly strange. Aside from those negatives, the camera does take beautiful photos, it's easy to use (except when you're trying to defocus the b/g), and the touch screen feature is very convenient.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's a gimmick", "Author": "Vantage", "ReviewID": "R1X6B16EZOP32F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera for the 3D and the SLR mode.  Not a whole lot of review where they touch on these things, so I will explain a little more about them.  First the 3D, the 3D is not that great, nothing jumping out at you or anything. It just gives more depth into the picture that your looking at.  Now the SLR or defocus mode.  This only works with images really close and even that I only could get it to work 20% of the time.  If you seen the commercial where they are taking a picture of this girl and then they blur out the background, not going to happen with this camera.

It still works fine, but it was getting a little long in the tooth. I've been following many of the digital camera websites, and in the compact camera space most of the attention seems to be focused on the Canon S95 and Panasonic LX5. I ended up ordering the LX5 but returned it promptly, due to a number of issues. Image quality wasn't as great as I expected for the high price, detachable lens cover was easily losable, and one small but maddening feature that the Canon S95 shares - a pop-up flash that pops up exactly where I hold the camera with my left hand. No matter how many times I reminded myself about the flash, I invariably forgot about it when shooting and had to pause to change my grip.With the two most \"popular\" compact cameras being non-starters for me, there were not that many other good options on the market until I came across the DSC-TX9 in one of the camera review websites (photographyblog.com). They gave it a great review, but I was still a little skeptical due to the credit-card form factor and the impossibly tiny lens (and not even in the center of the camera!) I kept looking for an S95 alternative with HD video and no pop-up flash without success. Somewhat hesitantly, I ordered the DSC-TX9 due to an upcoming trip and decided to give it a try.It has been several weeks now, and I have to say that I am extremely impressed with the camera. Despite its diminutive size and toy-like appearance, it is one sophisticated beast! There are a ton of cool special effects like panorama mode, 3-D capabilities, and burst shooting (for moving subjects). I fully refuse to learn the basics of aperture and shutter speed settings, so good auto settings for dummies are very important to me, and the DSC-TX9 does not disappoint. It can sense different situations, such as twilight vs. portrait, based on the subject you have in the focus area, and can even detect/follow faces and smiles. It takes great HD videos with optical zoom capability. Most importantly, it takes really good photos, both indoors and outdoors.As with any complex digital camera, there are some things which are not so great. First of all, the interface is mainly touch-screen. You will either love it or hate it, but it is used for most of the functions. Luckily there are a few important functions which still have physical buttons, such as switching from still pictures to videos and back. Also, not surprisingly for a camera this tiny, the zoom capabilities are fairly limited. It only has 4x optical zoom, so definitely not useful for scenes which require a telephoto lens. I never use the digital zoom due to degradation of image quality, but if you're ok with this it can extend the range somewhat.The flash (non pop-up) is surprisingly powerful but somewhat uneven in its coverage, which means you'll want to have adequate lighting before taking any portrait shots. Finally, to take the best pictures at the highest resolution, it does take some time to process between shots. This is especially apparent when you use the \"super intelligent\" autofocus mode, which is really cool in concept - it takes several shots in rapid succession and patches them together to create the best image - but means that there is at least a 4-5 second delay while the processor is working through this. Since I'd rather sacrifice some image quality for getting the shots I want (heresy to photo enthusiasts), I end up turning this feature off and end up using the burst feature a lot. You can even set it up to specify how fast you want the bursts to be. As long as you keep the shutter button pressed, it continues to take pictures at a certain speed until you lift your finger.Overall, I've been extremely impressed with this camera and will plan on using it as my primary travel camera. It also passed judgment from a higher authority than me - the wife did a rigorous comparison with family photos taken with our previous camera and gave it two thumbs up. In practical terms, this meant that I actually got to keep the camera. It definitely won't replace an SLR in terms of photo quality or shooting flexibility, but then it also means not having to walk around with a 10 pound weight around my neck.

I took photos and video from a helicopter while flying over Hoover dam, Lake Meade, and Grand Canyon.  Later after viewing my pictures and video I can tell you they are stellar.  I could not be happier with this camera. I can take excellent pictures and 1080i HD video from a sliver of a device that fits very nicely in to my jeans pockets. Others on Amazon.con also complain about \"soft\" photos.  Sorry I don't know what this means.  What I can say from my own experience is that I plugged this camera into my Sony HD TV ( XBR-60LX900) and I was amazed--both pictures ad videos were HD and vibrant--not to mention how nicely this camera connects and operates with a Sony TV and TV remote.For me....the average camera \"Joe\" I set this camera to the \"Superior Auto Adjustment\" and let the camera do all the work.  Zoom-in, zoom-out pictures/video whatever you want the camera does all the work in any situation bright or low-light, sports or portrait this camera does \"whatever\" to make sure you are the hero photographer.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R3T16IXT5BN0FL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the best point and shoot camera I have ever used.

I handle cases involving failures, accident investigation, etc.  Much of what I do is \"forensic photography\".  For most of my work I switched from a Nikon system to the Fuji X-Pro 1.  That said, this camera is never far from reach.  I bought a leather Blackberry phone holster which fits it like a glove (watch out, though... the magnet on the holster closure will turn the camera on accidentally if you don't keep it in the holster \"screen side out\").I use it all the time with excellent results.  The best part?  The macro.  In a word... INCREDIBLE!  The fact that the lens is on the corner of the camera body allows me to tuck it in close behind an object.  Because the macro focuses down to a centimeter or so from the front of the lens means I can capture very small objects where most cameras can't fit (this happened recently when I was the only investigator that was able to capture an image of a piece of evidence tucked way up under a deck beam).You need to understand the camera's limitations, however.  The flash will overpower a macro shot, for sure.  However, Sony makes up for this with very low light capability.  If you have a steady hand, you will get the shot.  The last limitation I would warn potential buyers about is the shutter lag.  It is significant.  You press the shutter release button and.......... snap.  If you want to buy this camera to take photos of the kids, sports or anything live and animated, look elsewhere.  For me, my subjects are either inanimate objects or not moving so shutter lag is not an issue.The images are great for use on a computer screen.  The small sensor size will not allow for quality big enlargements on paper, but heck, who prints this stuff anymore.Despite some drawbacks that the camera may have for some users, I had to rate this with 5 stars because it does exactly what I need it to do and it does it perfectly.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "TX9 how do I love thee?", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3H33E8SMY81YR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been a huge Canon Powershot fan for years, but after losing another one to the dreaded lens error, I decided to get this sony, partially because of the folded optics (fancy term means lens doesn't come out of the camera body at all even when zooming).

The camera comes with a wall charger and a Multi-Connector. The Multi-Connector has HDMI, USB, and AV conections, and DC in (4.2V). Took me a while to realize that the Multi-Connector DOES NOT charge the battery; the purpose of the DC-In is to power the camera when uploading your pics or movies, in order to save your battery power.I can't remember where I read that you could charge the battery in the camera, but so far, I haven't found how that's possible.

In low light it out performs my clunky SLR which costs heaps more. It's a rugged little point and shoot that has bumped around inside my purse for years now and has come out unscathed. Taking candid portraits (which is my focus) is a breeze. the soft skin option is really nice and  even blown up, is not easy to detect. People just come out beautifully. Being able to shoot in low light without a tri-pod or flash is very convenient. I have always disliked flash photography as Ive never quite mastered getting flash to convey the natural warmth. Though i'm sure there are cameras that can now surpass the sony DSC TX9, for the price I paid ( a hundred used) it really can't be beat. The only cons ive noticed are..this past year I have noticed my battery life is a bit sketchy and it takes a long time to charge. I'm sure a new battery is in order. I do wish the pixels were a bit higher than 12.2 even though at 12.2 i have been able to publish my photos without any problem as i'm not making poster prints or anything. Some of the settings are a little cumbersome and I'm sure I would benefit from reading the manual to figure out what some of them are..but all in all..those are both easily rectified. I wish this camera took better macro (it's not a fan of very close up pictures and occasionally I need to trick it by changing the ambient lighting to focus correctly for up close photos and If I could change lenses on it..well..wouldnt that just be the bees knees.  in summery, This camera is my favourite by far.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good - but low light/flash issues", "Author": "Leslie Wells", "ReviewID": "R25JE4CB6XSDG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a pretty good camera.

There's no converting of files to get them to your computer, or anything like that which we've experienced with other brands like Panasonic.  However, as with all previous Sony cams i've had, this camera doesn't do very well in low light.  Even with flash, your picture usually comes out with some kind of weird reddish shadow on it.  And forget the red-eye reduction ... that feature doesn't work at all.  I had dozens of pictures come out with red eye, only to have to fix later in post production.  Our other issue is the touch screen.  Not sure how this happened but after keeping the cam in my pocket for a day, i took it out and the screen now has a funky look to it.... almost like it got sunburned and it's peeled or something.

I even took it to several concerts and spilled beer on it a couple times. I was surprised it still worked.A few things I didn't like about it:It didn't handle bass sound too well when recording a concert, although I don't expect a point and shoot to do so.The screen is resistive instead of capacitive so it's difficult to navigate the touch menus.The screen coating will start to diminish so buy a screen protector.It does very poorly at taking night pictures outside and pictures have a ton of orbs in them.For the price that it is listed now (still expensive), I would go with something newer like the TX20 or the TX66 which have more features and take better nighttime pictures.
