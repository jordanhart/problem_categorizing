{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best digital camera available for the money!", "Author": "JanSobieski", "ReviewID": "R3L9UT8L9NITCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "And that includes all the offerings from Nikon, Olympus, and Minolta/Konica. I LOVE this camera.  The 10D was felt by many to have focusing issues and though I did not have any significant problem with my 10D in that regard the 20D represents a substantial improvement in this area.  Canon still is not offering (in this price range) a camera with eye control or 45 focusing points, BUT the nine focusing points that ARE offered are well placed and the camera focuses quickly and surely resulting in tack sharp photos.The pictures this camera takes are simply beyond belief.  Beautifully saturated, tack sharp, NO, and I mean NO noise at 400 or below and barely discernible noise all the way up to 1600 ISO.  For all practical purposes 1600 ISO is an entirely usable speed resulting in fantastic pictures.  What Canon has accomplished in reducing noise and increasing pixel density proves that they are, for now, the technology leader.Another big advantage over the 10D is the instant on feature which does not leave you sitting there helplessly until the camera turns on.  That happens instantly!  A new flash system, ETTL II is a vast improvement over the 10D.  And, to my eye, there is an improved dynamic range with slightly less blown highlights.The in camera processing results in far more pleasing pictures than the previous 10D or Digital Rebel.  This camera has a greater burst (more pictures quicker) that the previous 10D.Now there is currently an issue with mirror lockups reported by probably 10% - 20% of all owners.  If you encounter this problem before you update the firmware then simply take the battery out of the camera, reinsert it, and you're good to go.  Canon has issued a fix and it is available on their web site.  It completely remedies the problem so, not to worry!One of the greatest things about digital photography is the ability to build a digital dark room for next to nothing. With the included Photoshop Elements you are well on your way to producing pictures that you could only have imagined in the pre-digital days. I am able to recoup pictures that I never would have considered salvageable before this camera.The other thing I like about Canon is the lens system which IMO is second to none. Also, Canon continues to innovate at a furious pace driving the price of these digital cameras relentlessly downward.I sold my 10D to purchase this camera and for me it represented a significant improvement more than justifying the cost of the upgrade.So, I LOVE the camera. LOVE Canon. And LOVE digital. All in all I'd say I'm a pretty happy camper!", "Date": "September 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Best Digital camera for under $2000", "Author": "Ryan Davis", "ReviewID": "ROSU25QFPW8VW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second digital camera.  Previously I had used the Fuji Finepix s5000, but wanted to move up to an SLR system so that I could eventually use a variety of lenses.I was very concerned at the beginning of my DSLR buying process- it seems to me that once a person buys a body and a few lenses, they are committed to that camera maker's \"system\" pretty much for life, so I wanted to be very certain that this was the right choice.  If you purchase a 20d, you are not just buying a 20d, you are making (often) a pretty serious financial commitment to Canon technology.I chose a canon 20d for a few reasons; I had decided early on in the process to stick to Nikon or Canon, as they are the clear leaders not only of Digital SLRs, but of Camera technology in general.  Thus, though certain other SLRs like the Olympus E-Volt  or the Pentax  *istD are attractive, they simply do not have the range of accessories or the support community of either Canon or Nikon.I ended up seriously considering three cameras; the Canon 350d (Digital Rebel), The Canon 20d, and the Nikon D70.  From talking to other folks who were in the same situation as me, This seems to be a common range of choices people faceI ended up choosing Canon because it seems to me that they have a slightly better line of lenses than Nikon, particularly those available on the used market.  This is important, because the more you use your DSLR, the more you will want that lens that is just a slightly wider angle, or just a slightly faster aperture, etc.Once I decided to go for Canon, I chose the 20d over the 350d primarily due to size and toughness.  The 350d is a great Camera, and its sensor is very similar to the 20d.  However, the 20d's magnesium alloy chassis is much heavier than the 350d.  It can certainly take a lot more abuse than the plastic 350d body- and I tend to take my camera on a lot of long trips.  The 350d is a lot lighter, which is nice- but I frankly found its body too small to grip easily.  As I have very large hands, this was a serious disadvantage to me.  For someone with smaller hands the 350d probably feels fine.  You will have to pick one up and judge this for yourself.The layout of the camera itself is a lot easier to use than the 350d as well.  The camera requires far less attention when shifting settings than the 350d, and thus frees up your \"focus\" for the subject you are shooting.  I cannot stress how ergonomic and intuitive I find this camera to be.Since I have purchased the 20d, I have not regretted it for a minute.  This camera is a real joy to work with.  The viewfinder is nice and bright (looking through glass again instead of an EVF is a pleasure, believe me).  The range of ISO settings from 100-1600 is wonderful, particularly nice are long twilight/night shots at ISO 100 that give you some lovely colors.  Shooting night and low light with the 20d will blow your mind.  The CMOS sensor of the 20d produces almost noiseless images at high ISO settings.  The best feature of the camera is the quick start up time.  It can go from dormant to actively autofocusing in 0.2 seconds.  My previous camera took 2 seconds to \"turn on.\"  That may not sound like a great deal, but I lost countless shots due to that fact, and it is what pushed me most to upgrade my camera.I tend to shoot on aperture priority or A-DEP (like auto, but with no flash), but there are a variety of \"pre-set\" modes for portraiture, sports, night shooting, and so on that are easy to use.The megapixel count is nice, but not really that important.  Comparing images made from the 6 megapixel Nikon D70 and 8 megapixel Canon 20d, one can't really notice any difference until you blow them up to ridiculous sizes.  At this level of the MP game, the quality of the lens you use is far more important to final resolution than the sensors pixel count.  If you compare the kit lens (18-55mm f3.5-5.6) at its wide focal lengths and lower apertures with the canon 50mm f1.8 prime lens at f8, It looks like you are shooting with 2 different cameras.  The same holds for Nikon as well, so don't decide for the 20d simply because it has more megapixels than the D70.  Of course, even the worst canon lens beats the hell out of my old digicam on its best day.I have had a few problems with some older third party manufacturer lenses made for the Canon mount, Like Sigma and Tamron, not working with the new 20d body; but I have been told that if you ship off the lens to the manufacturer they will rechip it for free.  All currently manufactured 3rd party lenses ought to work with this body.  Keep in mind that the Canon digital sensor is smaller than 35mm film, so there is a \"focal length multiplier\" that makes your lenses \"longer\" than they would be on a regular film SLR.  The focal length multiplier for the 20d is 1.6 .  That means a 100mm lens on a film camera acts like a 160mm lens on a 20d.  For those who like to focus close up with telephoto, that's great, because you can buy a relatively inexpensive 300mm lens, and it will shoot almost like a 500mm telephoto.  I, however, usually shoot wide (more \"peripheral vision\") and prefer shorter lenses, so this is a pain. Of course, I would love to have a \"full frame\" camera like the Canon 5d, but the price is simply to much.It has a number of strengths and weaknesses, which I will detail below:Strengths:The variety of lenses is excellent.Lenses on second hand market are reasonably pricedIntroductory high speed lens (less than f2) is inexpensive (canon 50mm f1.8)Autofocus aquires targets quicklyContinuous shooting mode is quick- autofocus recalibrates for each shot.Extremely high ISO capability (1600) for low light situationsBody is physically tough.Very fast top shutter speed (1/8000) allows open apertures in well lit situations.Manual focus easy to usePop up flash is very high above camera, and thus avoids casting shadowsFlash recycles quicklyCF card memory system is versatile and inexpensiveUser interface is the best I have ever seenCan be used as a blunt weapon if you are muggedWeaknesses:It ain't cheapVery heavy, particularly with long lensesYou may end up spending money on glass that rivals a serious crack addictionLonger focal length multiplier (1.6) than film, or than Nikon (1.5).Doesn't work well with older 3rd party lenses without rechipping.Mirror is very loud, particularly if you are used to a point and shoot.Comparison with Nikon:20d is better at telephoto (lenses have internal motors)D70 is better at wide angle shots (focal length multiplier is lower)20d is better at low light (lower noise, lower ISO setting).Nikon fans believe that all Canon users are heretics, and vice versa, so why compare them you dirty heathen.", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "WOW!  The Best Prosumer Digital SLR out there Period!", "Author": "Just Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R3PIAVFOVV5CT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update:  I just spent three weeks in Africa in a very desolate and harsh environment with this camera.  I have to add - Don't overlook the construction on your dSLR.  I had heavy long telephoto lenses on it and the performance of the magnesium case, metal mounts, weather proofing, battery grip all is just amazing.  I hate to imagine how a lesser plastic frame might have performed.  After traveling by rattling/vibration ridden truck for days, dugout canoes in the middle of swamps, airplanes, hiking -- I came to appreciate Canon's commitment to construction. This camera and and the entire EOS system held up superbly under extremely abusive circumstances and can understand why professional photographers prefer this brand.  And the pictures?  Oh My, the pictures are just simply the best pictures I have ever taken in my life.  Not just because of the locations but because of this terriffic equipment.  My friend who had another major brand of camera complained about a muddy ant inside his lens, imagine a muddy ant inside his other major brand lens while he was shooting -- not with my Canon equipment (the sealing held up great).  Albeit - he's a better photographer so he probably got amazing shots I didn't -- I didn't worry about the equipment.  A+++ to Canon for the camera, the lenses, the battery grip - everything.On other news, I just read that canon is releasing the 5D so I guess my info from the original review was correct.  Its definitely a bigger higher end camera and at $3,200 definitely in a different class.  I think I'll keep my 20D for telephoto work and but with its full frame sensor, I might get a 5D for wide angle photography.  Again, amazing equipment from Canon.Original Review:I'm a first time dSLR buyer  (bought the 20D from Amazon -- great service).  This was a big jump for me and I read and I read before I decided on this purchase and whether I should jump into the dSLR world.  I'd outgrown point and shoot a while back.On the 20D.  I agonized over the 10D and the 6megapix Digital Rebel until the 20D came out and I quickly decided on the 20D.  I picked the 20D because of solid magnesium case, 9point autofocus, 8.2megapix sensor and DIGIC II, and Instant On.  So even after the Rebel XT came out -- the 20D is in a different class altogether. The 20D is a professional chassis and you can use it as a pro camera -- the Rebel is for world travelers (In my opinion).My agony now is over what type of photography I want to do.  I only have the kit lens and a $79 dollar 50mm f/1.8 II ... lenses are expensive especially the good ones as I'm learning:Here is what I've learned (intended for the new people who are wondering if they want dSLR or not).  dSLR is really about the lenses and the options that you can use on the camera. You need great lenses for great pictures. This is my gradeschool version on dSLRs and lenses and I hope it helps:The setup -- Lets suppose you are standing next to your car and on your car's hood sits your girlfriend and on the hood unbeknownst to her sits a litle grasshopper.  Behind your car is a lake and in the distance there's a huge snow capped mountain.  This is the difference lenses make:Prime Lenses:  Would let you take wonderful facial shot of your girlfriend (boyfriend).  If the lens has a good aperture, you might be able to blur the background so you only get her beautiful face and get rid of the annoying mountain and they tend to be light and small. (Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 is a prime lens -- $350)Super Wide Angle Lenses:  Expands the foreground and compresses the background.  So you'd get a picture of your girlfriend on the car which would both be huge and a lake that would stretch to the horizon and the mountain would look tiny in the far off distance. (Canon EF 14mm f/2.8L is a super wide angle lens -- $1,800)Telephoto Lenses:  Compress the foreground and magnify the distant objects.  You would wind up taking a picture that would magnify the mountain in the background but your girlfriend, car, and lake would either be very small and compressed in the foreground or they wouldn't even come out in extreme telephoto lenses as you'd only get the mountaintop and cut out the rest.  Your girlfriend would also wonder about your relationship at the sight of the humongous lens: good telephotos can be HUGE and heavy! (Canon 400mm EF f/2.8L is a super telephoto lens $6,000)Macro Lenses:  Let you take pictures of very small things and they tend to allow you to focus quite close in on the subject.  You'd walk up to your girlfriend and she'd wonder what you were doing so close to the hood.  You'd give her a peck on the cheek and then you'd close in on the little grasshopper next to her.  With a macro lens, you'd could take a great picture of the little grasshopper and it would fill my frame.  If your girlfriend is like mine, she'd be off the car as soon as she caught glimpse of the bug.  Old stereotype here no disrespect ladies - I know a few that would put me to shame. (Canon EFS 60mm f/2.8 is a macro lens -- $450)Zoom Lenses:  Are any lenses that allow you to shift the focal length.  That is to say I can make it more wide angle or more telephoto.  The 20D comes with a 18 to 55 zoom lens which gives you marginal wide angle and up to 3x telephoto.  Not a bad kit lens but its not USM (Ultrasonic) so autofocus is not as fast and not as accurate and can fail to focus sometimes and its not IS (Image stabilized) which lets you take clearer pictures without a tripod. (Canon EFS 17-85mm IS USM is a zoom lens that covers some wide angle at 17mm and some telephoto at 85mm -- $600).  You can turn the barrel and you can change focal length!! What a wonderful invention but they're more complex with more parts than primes and the extra parts add weight and they generally affect the amount of light they let in (aperture stuff) but you don't have to change lenses and they offer more flexibility.Now bear in mind that if you're out there in the middle of a blooming field in Georgia and start changing lenses, you can get dirt or pollen in the sensor.  I only change my lenses indoors in a non windy environment.Exposure and Shutter Speed:  Exposure is controlled by the ISO sensitivity of the sensor (ISO rating is another arcane film invention basically lower the ISO number the more sensitivity to light).  One of the problems with smaller sensors was noise (graininess) on the pictures at high ISO numbers.  Well not on the 20D the noise is imperceptible to me.  Shutter speed is also controlled by your 20D...and the 20D has a great shutter 5frames per second, up to 1/8000 of a second.  Wow! So you have two out of three big components taken care of here and the 20D is first rate on a ton of other things like custom White balance etc.A note on Aperture.  Its just how much light can come into the lens (the size of the hole). The lower the aperture number f/# on the lense the more light it allows.  Aperture determines depth of field (how much of the foreground + background is in focus) and it constrains shutter speeds.  Now aperture is a function of lens construction -- a 400mm f/2.8 lens is humongous and costs $6,000 while a 70-300mm telephoto f/4.5 to 5.6 is $1,200 but with the 400mm lens (get this)...you can use faster shutters and freeze the action of a quarterback spinning in midair across the field on a night game (or freeze your son as he's swinging a bat in little league:  ball bat and son frozen in midair!).  With the 70 to 300mm, you'd have to use a slower shutter and you'd get blurr and blurry does not make the cover of the USA Today nor brings a smile to grandpa.  On another example, if you've been hiking for a month to take a picture of a sloth that moves at 1cm a year in some god forsaken South American jungle, the 70-300mm lens will weigh allot less and allow you to run faster than the 400mm white monster lens.  If I'm a nature photographer, I'd rather come out with the picture than fall victim to some relocated pigmy tribe because I couldn't run fast enough and have someone years later find my bones still clutching my white 40lb $6,000 lens in the middle of Brazil still attached to my 20D with a flashcard full of razor sharp gorgeously blokehed* pigmy and sloth pictures, ala blair witch project.  So get a lens for what you need -- I guess is what I recommend. (*Blokeh are those out of focus circles of light in the backgrounds of pictures taken with expensive good lenses)A word on Nikon.  There are two camps of photographers these days Canon and Nikon (well there are others like Leica - but if you own a Leica you're probably a pro, don't care about feature battles and are laughing at my gradeschool analysis).  The 20D is more expensive and better chassis feature for feature than the D100 - go compare 8.2megapix vs 6.1 and the list goes from there.  Nikon owners will tell you that their lenses have backwards compatibility 50 years...yes but you'll have to manually focus those lenses and on some of them you have to pay some guy to saw off some metal flaps to make them fit the D100.  Canon EF has been around since 1986 and there are a ton of autofocus lenses out there. EF is the standard lens mount that fits the 20D and there is a newer mount called the EF-S Mount that also fits.  Canon is very conservative in their advertisement as they aim for educated consumers: D100 claims a burst mode of 144 pictures -- yes but on the low quality setting, 20D can do the same if you cut the quality down...you'll hear spot metering, megapixels, focus speed --- you need to read to understand all of this and make a sound decision.  Nikon makes great cameras and I don't want to get into a war.  If you already own a bunch of recent Nikor lenses -- your mind is already made up.  A good friend of mine owns the D70 and another the Digital Rebel and me with the 20D -- we're all happy.  After much review and a ton of reading, I liked the 20D better for my purpose as a personal preference I bought it and am very happy.On crop factors.  Lenses are still stuck in the 35mm film focal length format world and 35mm film is bigger than the sensors on the 20D and this means simply that the EF and EFS lenses turn out more telephoto on the 20D.  So a lens marked 10mm is actually a 16mm (multiply mm times 1.6 to get actual focal length) on a 20D and other small sensor cameras (Rebel and Rebel XT).  The crop 1.6 crop is not extra zoom -- it only appears that way, its actual lost information.  So, to telephoto photographers, this means you carry more weight than you need in physical glass and to wide angle photographers, it means its harder to find lenses that do true wide angle bc the sensor is too small to capture all the information.  EFS was designed so they could make smaller lenses at least so don't lose information but they're still labeled \"old school\" and you still have to multiply.  EFS was designed to take advantage of the smaller sensors on the 10D 20D Digital Rebel and Rebel XT.  The higher end Canon cameras use a 35mm size sensor.  People wonder if Canon will adopt bigger sensors for all lines and if they do, then EFS will probably go the way of the dodo.  On the other hand, bigger sensors are expensive to make so who knows where it will go and the 20D has very low noise at higher ISOs (used to be one of the reasons they thought bigger sensors would prevail -- that and the 35mm mindset and large number of lenses out there for 35mm).  I can't predict the future -- Canon seems to be still investing in both EF and EFS though and I think that for the next 3-6 years you're fine with either EF or EFS.I heard a rumour that Canon is planning to release a new camera between the 20D and their higher end 1Ds around December?  If you must have latest and greatest and have $4,000 to spend you might want to wait.  If true, I'm sure the chassis will cost $2,500 - $3,000 -- just rumours here.  I'm keeping my 20D until I can make money to justify more expensive than this extremely good camera.  In my opinion, this new camera would not supplant the 20D as much as it would provide Canon a more complete EOS Digital line from Digital Rebel all the way up to the 16.7megapix 1Ds -- they'd provide an true entry level Pro Camera in the $2,000 to $3,000 range.  Most interesting to me will be if it has 45pt autofocus and the size of the sensor.  Also interesting, Canon is releasing a new 60mm EFS f/2.8 Macro lens.  Good quality and interesting choice in focal length.  Amazon carries it.  I think Canon is telling us something with the type of EFS lenses they're releasing and the market they are targetting.  Keep watching Canon.Back to my 20D, I've only bought a 50mm f/1.8 lens for $79 and the kit lens and a tripod.  I can't wait to get a USM (ultrasonic silent 0.5 second focusing lens) with IS (Image stabilization) -- if I can only decide what type of photography. But with what I have, I've taken pictures that have floored my friends and everyone who has seen them.  Someone actually said, \"I'll pay you for that picture.\"  And that is a great complement to me and to the 20D and the complement goes to the 20D because my lenses are cheap! I am a huge Canon fan now and long and short of it, the 20D is an amazing camera and the best prosumer chassis out there (period!).", "Date": "April 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very nicely designed camera - fun to use.", "Author": "rjpryan \"Ryan\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z285XOQH6RQS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon 20D package with the stock 18-55mm zoom lens about three weeks ago.  Since then, I have taken several hundred pictures and am very happy with the camera - highly recommended if you can justify the price.  I've broken this review up into sections due to its length.1.  Lensa.  18-55 mm stock lensThe lens isn't great, but on the other hand, it's not bad.  On the pro side, it's lightweight, cheap, small, and seems to focus fairly quickly.  The only bad thing about the lens is that it produces slightly soft pictures, but if you won't be blowing the pictures up too large, you probably won't notice.b.  17-85 mm USM IS lensBeing obsessed with quality, after having the camera for about a week, I purchased (also on Amazon) the Canon 17-85 mm USM IS (Image Stabilized) zoom lens.  I've been very happy with this lens and would recommend it if you can afford it.  The IS is quite impressive - it really works.  This lens isn't perfect either, but it seems noticeably better than the 18-55 (and only six times as expensive!!).2.  Compact FlashI'd recommend that you purchase a SanDisk Ultra II 1 GB compact flash card with it - these are sold here on Amazon.  This card provides about 5 MB per second write speed which is significantly better than many of the cheaper cards - there are some websites on the net which review cards (and even one which has tested them all in a Canon 20D) - it's worth looking into.3.  BatteryThe battery life has been very good for me so far - the specs say that you can take about 1000 pictures with flash on half of them, and I don't doubt that (although I haven't pushed it that far yet).  The charger is also nice and compact (easy to travel with) and charges the batteries in about an hour and a half (fast!).4.  DesignThis camera is fun to take pictures with!  Through the lens composing allows precise control of depth of field, focus, and cropping - it's also much easier to use in full sunlight as compared to a point and shoot digicam.  It operates much like a film SLR in that you set most of the settings on the top LCD panel, compose through the viewfinder, etc., but it also adds the color LCD screen to view the pictures you've just taken.  The other thing I really like about this over a film SLR is the ability to set the ISO and white balance on the fly.  With film, you'd have to load a different roll of film for different lighting conditions or ISO - now it's the simple twist of a dial.  While these features are available on most consumer point and shoot digital cameras, they're generally much harder to get to through the menu system.  One great advantage of this camera is that it has so *many* buttons and dials - it's very easy to get to most frequently used functions without wading through extensive menus.  They're also very ergonomically placed so I can switch most settings I care about while looking through the viewfinder just by feel.Another nice pro is the backlit top LCD panel which makes night shooting easy.5.  Bad PointsHmm..  Not much I can think of that I don't like about it.  My camera came with a 'starter quantity of dust' (quoted from some other website) on the imaging chip - but I was able to blast it off with a rubber bulb.  Be aware that digital SLR's tend to gather dust on the chip - especially if you change lenses a lot - but this is nothing against Canon - it happens on them all.It's a shame that it doesn't show you the current ISO setting in the viewfinder (or on the top panel unless you hit a button).  Several times I've left it at ISO 1600 by accident when I didn't really need that speed.It's a little heavy, but I find that I actually like the weight - makes it feel more solid.I wish it had an IR receiver so you could use an infra-red remote with it - but alas - it doesn't (even though the Digital Rebel does!).  I had to buy the Canon RS-80N3 wired remote (which works well).7.  ConclusionAn awesome camera overall - definitely go for it if you can afford it!  I still kept my old compact digicam as a backup for cases when I don't want to carry an SLR, but in general, I'll use it 95% of the time.  Much more enjoyable to take pictures with than a standard digicam - try it - you'll like it.", "Date": "November 18, 2004"}, {"Title": "How the 20D changed my life!", "Author": "Dave \"www.eosrebels.com\"", "ReviewID": "R2VLHJZ7AXFNYZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A year ago I sold my Digital Rebel on eBay and purchased the 20D.  I have since not looked back.  This camera has brought nothing but joy to myself and others.  The sharpness and colors from the famed Canon sensor are true to their reputation.  Friends and family all love the pictures that come out of this camera.  I take it with me almost everywhere I go.After selling my Rebel, I debated upgrading to the new Rebel XT or the 20D, which I'm sure many of you might be having right now before pulling the trigger.  I held both in my hand and played with them at the PMA tradeshow where the XT was introduced.  It was very light and felt very small in my hands.  I don't have exceptionally large hands, but the XT felt like it was designed for smaller hands.  That being said, it is a great travel partner to have being so compact and light-weight.The other drawback, however, is that the user interface is quite different from the 20D.  Although it may seem like a trivial feature, the dial navigation on the 20D has been immensely more convenient and practical when shooting compared to pressing the buttons on the Rebel or the XT.  I didn't like having to navigate through the ISO or other changes to white balance via the LCD screen.  I definitely think there's a reason why the 20D is more expensive beyond the fact that it has the solid magnesium alloy body.  The user interface for me was worth the extra money as well.  The more you take photos, the more you will realize the freedom that comes with controlling your aperture, shutter speed, white balance and more with the 20D interface versus the XT.  That being said, it is still several hundred dollars more expensive and the XT has pretty much the same sensor (just 0.2 fewer megapixels) with the same results in a different body.  So don't be concerned about getting inferior photos with the XT, because the differences are mostly all external.I highly recommend getting the kit lens with either camera.  For an additional $70-100 it is well worth it just for the range and it has pretty decent quality results.  Bang for your buck it can't be beat.  Make sure you pick up a EF 50mm f/1.8 II USM lens for another $70-80.  This is a powerful little lens at a great price.(...)", "Date": "November 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great with the right lens and a flash", "Author": "Pierrick Verilhac", "ReviewID": "R38E0VKQ7SPLLC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned the 20D since November 2004, and I must have shot around 10,000 pictures with it. Before that, I had a Canon Powershot A80, which delivered consistently good pictures, but was slooooow to start up and had a big shutter lag. The 20D solves these problems with flying colors (no pun intended). Start up is instantaneous (you will spend much longer removing the lens cap!) and there's no shutter lag.The other expectation that I had was to get shallow depth of field in my pictures (almost impossible with the A80). The problem was that I ordered the camera with the basic 18-55mm lens that comes with it. I shot with nothing but this lens during 6 months (I couldn't afford anything else), and was not very satisfied with the sharpness (even by changing the parameter in the custom functions), the vibrance of the colors, and the poor bokeh. I tried a demo version of DXO optics pro, which made me realize how soft my basic lens was. It's OK, I knew I shouldn't expect too much from that basic lens.When I was able to afford a second lens, I realized how good the 20D could be. I got a Canon 70-200mm f4L telephoto lens, and man! does this make a difference! The pictures I get with that lens are awesome: crisp, sharp, vibrant, constrasty, and finally I got the bokeh I was expecting.Then I got the Speedlite 420EX flash, and my pictures became just wonderful. It solves all the problems that people may experience with the built-in flash.So, basically, try different lenses on this body, and you'll be surprised how much better your pictures can get with the right lens. Your pictures will only be as good as the weakest element of your system. Well, the weakest element won't be the 20D body!The major complaint I have, though I know it's inherent to all digital SLR (except the Olympus), is the dust on the sensor. It's very disappointing to make 400 shots in a session and then find the same 3 ugly dust spots on every single picture, regardless of the aperture you shot at. I tried the sensor swabbing method to clean it, it worked fine, but it scares me too much to do it on a regular basis. Nothing that Photoshop couldn't fix, but still, it drives me crazy.I also learned to live without the spot metering, but I still don't understand why they didn't include it. They can't expect you to buy the 1D Mark II instead, since only pros can afford to spend that much money on a body. And you don't need to be a pro to feel the need for a spot metering. Everything I learned about photography refered to the use of that spot metering (John Shaw, Bryan Peterson...).Anyway, great camera body, very average lens. Expect to invest in a better lens and an external flash. I gave it four stars because of the dust on the sensor (not its fault, but still, it's frustrating).", "Date": "June 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - but check out the Rebel XT", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3O9G9Q77OIZUT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this 20D from Amazon last week.  I ordered the body only and the EF-S 17-85 IS lens with it.  Shipping was on-time.  Regarding the camera - it takes great pictures but man is it heavy!  With the EF-S 17-85 lens, it feels like it weighs 5 pounds when it is hanging from my neck or when I'm holding it.  The build quality is excellent, though.  However, I can't help but think I should have compromised for the new Digital Rebel XT.  The XT and 20D have nearly the same image quality (8.2MP for the 20D and 8.0MP for the XT) and have the exact same processor (Digic II).  However, the build quality of the XT is noticeably cheaper and flimsier than the 20D.  But, at a savings of $500 dollars, I'd highly recommend taking a serious look at the XT.  Its significantly lighter and will probably be around longer than the 20D (Web rumors suggest that Canon will replace the 20D around Christmas with a newer prosumer DSLR that will be rougly analogous to the Mark 1D (11.1MP, etc.).  As it stands, Canon has released a new prosumer model almost annualy since 1999.  And $500 dollars is still $500 dollars.  I would suggest going to a local retailer (like Best Buy) to play with both models before you make a purchase.  Either way, I would recommend buying from Amazon.  I have used Amazon.com for 2 years now and have had no complaints with them thus far.  Also, I would highly recommend checking out [...] and [...] to read other reviews of these and other cameras.  I found these sites to be helpful when I was preparing for my purchase.The bottom line is that I am pleased with the 20D, the 17-85 lens, and the ordering/shipping process as well. I hope you find this review helpful.", "Date": "March 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect -but not quite", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R17DHL33LB7BM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want the full hard core review of this camera you need to be looking somewhere like [...] because there's far more to this camera than a normal user will ever meet.Having said that we are left with just the little bits and pieces a normal user would use.The camera is actually a little smaller than optimal for a person with average sized hands, the little finger of the right hand has nowhere to sit and the EOS10D actually feels better. But in normal use you won't notice this. The viewfinder is small, in many cases you just have to trust that it really has done a good job of focus because there isn't enough image for you to see for yourself. I find it quite difficult to be certain that I even have the camera level. It's also not the brightest viewfinder you ever saw.Battery life is very good, even powering an image stabilized lens, I just filled a 1Gb card on a single battery, that's a few hundred images and the battery still isn't showing low.Dust has been a small issue, there are cameras now that will clean their own sensor but this isn't one. I eventually found a good hand air blower. You can not use canned air or a brush to clean the sensor, either can damage the camera badly. Once I got the dust off, it was there from new, it has remained clean. So maybe it's not that much of an issue. I use Tokina 24-200, Canon 50mm and Sigma 80-400 OS EX lenses, so I do change the lens fairly often, so perhaps dust isn't that big an issue.Switch on is unbelievably fast, slow switch on times have cost me numerous shots with other cameras, with the 20D the camera is on by the time you realize the switch has clicked into place. Speaking of which, on a camera with excellent ergonomics the on-off switch is about the only thing that doesn't come to hand well, but it's not a factor in normal use. Just not perfect.Low light performance has been excellent, the camera will shoot at 800 or even 1600 ASA with no apparent noise. You can even configure it to use 3200ASA, but you get significant noise effects with some faint horizontal lines and grain like effects, though I was shooting under sodium light. Even at 3200ASA the pictures are better than with fast print film under similar conditions.You do need to be mindful that the exposure controls on this camera really do do what they say, you need to keep your eye on the shutter speed and aperture to get the shot you think you want, this isn't an instant camera that will just make the most of it. Most of the time the idiot modes, sport or scenic or whatever, will actually do a good job of picking the right settings. If you are in a hurry then use the built in functions. For example, in sports mode it switches to predictive autofocus, shutter priority and continuous shooting, which are all good choices.The autofocus is excellent, however in programmed modes you need to pay attention to which of the focus zones it has actually selected. If there is something closer to you than the subject you may need to select the correct focus point, fortunately this is very easy to do, you can hit the control and then select the focus point using the joystick, both with your right thumb.Another minor irritation to me is that if you are using the fully auto mode, which does a very good job of most things, it will sometimes select the flash even though the autofocus should tell it that the subject is way out of range. Perhaps I expect too much?Picture quality? Well, unless you have an absolutely perfect lens and need to make 36\" wide posters you are unlikely to find that the camera is a limiting factor. I'm actually waiting to see an Epson R1800 because the current generation of printers can't reproduce the quality I have available with this camera and my lenses.The built in flash is inadequate and the flash metering is soometimes poor, I was taking pictures near a road recently and whenever a reflective sign was in shot the picture was under exposed. Recharge times are pretty poor too, but I think the built in flash should be regarded as an emergency or backup method only, if you are serious then you need a serious flash. I'll be adding either the Speedlite 580EX or a Metz 54 flash in the near future.I'll also be adding an L-series lens in place of the Tokina, the Tokina is OK, but not good enough for my brothers wedding.Would I buy it again? Sure. Will I trade for the next great EOS digital to come on the scene? Unlikely. Maybe if it has a larger viewfinder and a 35mm sensor, but this camera already does way more than I need.", "Date": "June 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "amateur and pros alike can't go wrong with this digital", "Author": "A H O", "ReviewID": "R33M636Y4GDKRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't think there is a camera out there that can compete with the Canon EOS 20d for the money.  I am a semi professional photographer and I take images from high speed action to high def. macro.  The range of features on this camera is amazing.  The custom settings, the auto settings and the scenery settings are all perfect.  The camera adjusts the white balance perfectly AND it lets you customize it if you want.  It takes 8.2 mega pixels which will let you enlarge phots to as big as you can print them without losing quality.  It has speed like no other digital camera. It says in its advertsing that it can take up to 23 shots at a time at 5 frames per second.  The advertising is wrong.  It can take well OVER 23 shots at a time at 5 frames a second.  I have personaly take over 7 seconds of continuos shooting. 36 frames to be exact. And that is at 8.2 megapixels.  It takes a high end memory card to do it, but it does it none the less.  Image quality?  Amazing.  Ease of use?  Phenominal.  Those who say it is complicated probably can't set up their alarm clock either.  Don't get me wrong, this camera is so feature rich that you will need to read the manual to get it all figured out.  But out of the box without reading a thing I was taking advanced shots, setting my own shutter and or f-stop, changing ISO speeds, taking single and multi burts shots and more without reading the manaul.  Now I've worked with digitals before but never a canon.  The construction is top rate.  It feels solid in your hand.  It doesnt feel plasticky, or hollow.  The controls are easy to reach, and it's comfortable to hold.  Ive heard of people complain that it's to small.  Well, I've got fairly large hands and I dont have any trouble holding it.  One of the best features on this camera though is thenearly instant on.  .2 seconds from flipping the switch to taking a picture.  This has saved me a number of times.  It also turns off after a minute of sitting idle to save battery life.  Then you simply press the shutter button down and it's back on instantly.  Oh ya..one of the best things about it for me...it records the photo settings along with the image.  When I go back and review my images the camera can also tell me what the exact settings were for each shot so I know what to set them to for the best picture.  The battery life is simply amazing as well.  I have a 2 gig flash card in my camera.  I took over 500 pictures at a mountain bike race last weekend, and I wasnt even close to the end of the power life.  Canon says it will take over 700 pics per charge. I believe it!  I honestly can't think of anything negative about this camera.  Oh wait...the viewing screen is a bit small, and a bit hard to see in the sun.  If they could make the viewing screen bigger, and more direct light viewing friendly, this camera would be perfect in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong, its not TO small.  Just smaller than I prefer.  All in all though, I have looked at a LOT of cameras, and I have not found one that even comes close to this one.  It has more features, and nicer features.  More memory and a faster shooting speed.  Easier operation, and better build than any of the cameras that compare in price.

Shaff \"Velocipede\"", "ReviewID": "R3QLIMV4CBZ3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just a little over a year ago, I became fascinated with digital photography, but not for the reasons most amateur photographers cite. I was in the market for a new home and, as I was looking at one with my realtor one day, I ran across a home filled with pictures. These were all pictures taken by the owners with SLR and D-SLR cameras. The pictures were diverse, but they simply made the home quite warm and interesting (disclosure: I didn't buy the house, but I did take away a new passion!). As a result of this \"warm, fuzzy\" feeling of seeing a large volume of pictures embellishing the flavor of this home, I decided to jump into digital photography with both feet. I knew I wasn't ready for the \"big cameras,\" so I bought the Canon A80 4MP digital. Since that time, I've taken hundreds of photos, some which I've blown up to 8 x 10s and are hanging in my office (the Continental Divide on a snowy day and Puerto Vallarta sunsets). This particular camera, which I reviewed previously, was a great starter camera, and one which I'll hang on to for future \"snapshots.\" That said, this warm fuzzy feeling I had when looking at this home described above has turned into a heated passion. As a result, the \"heat\" quickly pushed me toward a more serious D-SLR.When looking for a newer D-SLR, one with greater diversity, features, and higher-quality output, I did my due diligence like I do on most purchases. I did however, read one review that pretty much summed up the camera buying experience. This reviewer said there are three types of camera buyers: 1) those who only buy Nikon, 2) those who only buy Canon, and 3) those who can't decide between Nikon and Canon. Very astute and very true. After much consternation (and not wanting to get caught in #3), I decided on Canon, and purchased the 20D. I must tell you that I look looked at the camera superstores and boutiques, but found that Amazon had a very competitive price and besides, I'm an Amazon junkie. In any event, I purchased the 20D with the 18mm-55mm kit. That said, let me take a quick detour on to lens purchases.Since my 20D purchase, I've quickly learned that, while the camera is the foundation for high quality pictures, and imagination is the fuel for creating beautiful shots, the lens is the bridge between the two. Honestly, if I had to do it over again, I would not have purchased the 18-55mm lens with the camera; rather, I would have made a body purchase only. This lens is good for \"everyday\" shooting, but I was looking for the greatest breadth of exposure in the least number of lenses. The 18mm-55mm lens fits the middle of the road in terms of macro/zoom parameters however, it did not fit the boundries I set for the lenses I wanted. Using Amazon customer reviews and several photography-based web sites, I began my search for lenses that would give me the broad range I sought. Although expensive, I believe I've found an excellent, albeit heavy duo: the Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Standard Zoom Lens and the Canon EF 70mm-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens. Add a 2x telephoto extender, and I effectively have from 24mm exposure to 400mm exposure (the 2x extender fits the 70mm-200mm lens and doubles its zoom capabilities). Yes, these two lenses (and the 2x extender) have run around $3K, but both are \"L\" lenses (top of Canon's line) and both should easily provide me with the depth and breadth of pictures I wish to take. (Warning: if you decide to purchase the extender, make sure you check the lens compatibility. The extender only fits certain lenses.) Back to the camera...As an impassioned amateur, the 20D was easily the best purchase for me given its volume of features and photo quality. I doubt seriously I'll need to upgrade for years. I've taken a few hundred shots since the purchase, and the quality of the photos can only be described as smooth as butter. The color is brilliant, and exposure is top notch. There is no noticeable resolution distress (I believe the pros call it \"noise\") regardless my focal point. The camera has an instant startup, which is important to anyone needing a quick shot. And, the time differential between shots is immediate. Although this camera allows manual settings for specific shots, I find myself in automatic mode in most cases, both from an ease of use standpoint and allowances for my inexperience. I've read many reviews redressing the built-in flash and its inadequacies however; I've not yet had that problem. All shots I've taken, which have needed additional light, have been more than adequately handled with the built-in flash.At this point, the absolute only downside I have found is the weight factor in terms of my combination of camera and chosen lenses. The camera body itself is not a weight factor however, add either one of the lenses I purchased and it becomes something of a different story (particularly with the 70mm-200mm lens). Now, this is not to say that I have any regrets relative to these purchases; rather, it is the only downside I've found. The camera body weighs only a 1.5 lbs however, the 70mm-200mm lens adds 2.9 lbs, which makes the total unit weight something over 4 lbs...not inconsequential when taking numerous photos.All-in-all, this jazzed amateur gives the 20D two thumbs up for ease of use and incredible quality, particularly in the $2,000 and under D-SLR category.

The advent of 800 thousand pixels (not 8MP!) digital camera was a great milestone in my digital camera life. I'm always totally enchanted by the ever-growing intelligent features of newly announced digital cameras so far. My most favorite digital camera was NIKON Coolpix 5000 which was an 8 megapixel machine with superb image quality.However, the limitations by its compactness are as follows: - Long startup time (many lost shots) - Frequent off the marks shots - Frequent battery changes required  (3 changes per half a day) - Night shots unsatisfactory - Many, many blurred imagesLast year, magnificent advertising talks of EOS 20D attracted my attention: - A top shutter speed of 1/8,000 seconds - 5 fps performance for up to 23 consecutive frames - Long battery life (700-1000 shots per one charge)My EOS 20D completely shattered my strong belief that digital cameras were not suitable for long range shots. To my great surprise, the shots taken by the EOS 20D proved otherwise! This is the moment I really felt the happiness of having purchased the EOS 20D.The EOS 20D features high-resolution of 8.2MP which is the only unsatisfactory point in the long range viewpoint because the race for high-resolution continues on and on. More amazing fact is that it can record 4-5MB data in JPEG and nearly 9MB data in RAW mode in 5 fps performance!It is possible to take 400-500 shots in one charge even if you check every shot on the rear display.

I will not go into all the technical details about this camera, as this information is available in the product description and in other reviews.  I will say that this is not a camera for one just getting into digital photography.  This is a (near) professional quality instrument and has so many options that one not grounded in digital photography would be quickly overwhelmed.  It is also higher priced than the typical consumer-grade digital camera, with an asking price of right arund $1400 dollars at the time of this writing.  Once you add a couple of filters, a telephoto zoom lens, and some other accessories, you quickly have an investment of over $2,000 dollars.  Thus, this is not a camera for the masses.If you are looking for a camera that provides you with all the versitility of a SLR quality film camera, you have come to the right place.  Canon's 20D will absolutely overwhelm you with its extensive options!  This is truly a versitile instrument that will allow you to do virtually anything in photography!  I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that the Canon 20D is the best camera for its price in its class. It blows the competition away.The camera body has a firm heavy feel to it.  It is not a miniature digital camera at all.  It fills and fits the hand nicely, much like a SLR should feel.  The buttons, wheels, and controls are all within finger reach, but there are so many options that one has a pretty good learning curve to be proficient with the camera.  By the way, the instruction manual is well over 150 pages, and it does a mostly adequate job of introducing the camera controls to the operator.  Still, it has taken me several weeks of use and review to learn the camera's many features and then remember them so that the operations are automatic.The pictures I have taken are very pleasing.  One can shoot in low light, bright light and all conditions in-between.  A flash is available and pops up automatically if desired for additional light.  This camera takes excellent pics in low-light conditions.The lens that comes with the camera is acceptable and I am pleasd with the sharpness of the images produced.  Other reviewers have stated that compared to fixed focal length lenses, such as the 50 mm, the variable zoom lens is not as sharp.  My view is that the lens provided is very adequate for virtually all applications, however, if the operator wants the very sharpest images possible, especially for portrait work, then perhaps a fixed focal length lens is beneficial.  I purchased a EF-S 28-135 IS lens for a telephoto zoom, and am happy with it.  Again, the quality of the zoom does not approach that of the Canon \"L\" series lenses, but then how many consumers can afford a single lens that is over $4,000 dollars?  From my perspective as an amateur that shoots a lot of images, I think the 20D is more than adequate for my needs.I highly recommend this camera to any amateur photographer that seeks a highly versitile top-quality camera that is a definite cut above the rest.

From the hefty weight to the sizable size and the solid grip, it makes you feel you are holding a real SLR, unlike with the Digital Rebel (EOS 300D).  BTW this is assembled in Japan instead of Taiwan (300D).2) The camera is very fast.  It's not \"instant on\" like the Nikon 70D but it's still damned fast with very littel shutter lag.  When you use a high-speed CF card, the shot-to-shot performance is satisfying for most fast-action scenarios.3) Great auto focus, great exposure, and great picture quality.  Canon's expertise in combining optics and electronics once again shines through.  The prints made from this baby, and in part thanks to the 8MP resolution, is just total pro-quality.4) The kit lens is not really that good, unlike what Nikon bundles in their kits.

Partly because it has the dedicated portrait shutter button and the shutter speed dial but more importantly it extends the grip in landscape mode just a tad bit more.  The added height and other features that the extension grip adds more than justifies for the added weight. The grip can also accomodate a second battery.", "Date": "November 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "this camera does it all.....and more", "Author": "clearasmud", "ReviewID": "R1ET5PZ49MU8M6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I were sick and tired of the \"shutter lag\" that point and shoots are plagued with.  We missed a lot of good pictures due to this.  That lead me to look at digital SLRs, which do not suffer this malady.  Also, most P&S; cameras have plastic bodies.  While this may keep costs down, and it certainly makes a camera lighter, nothing compares to a good old metal body - like on the 20D.  In fact, the metal body was a big reason we opted for this camera over the more affordable Digital Rebel (plus the 8.2 MP vs 6 MP).  Canon recently introduced an 8.0 MP version of the Digital Rebel.  If a metal body is not a big deal to you, you may wish to look into that.One thing to keep in mind when using this camera indoors - lighting is important.  Indoor pictures turn out darker than anticipated.  This can be overcome by proper lighting and camera angle.  Outdoors, you will get outstanding results every time.I have been experimenting with the \"creative zone\" settings of this camera with mixed results.  I have used a slow shutter release to take some good pictures of the moon and stars reflecting off of the Gulf of Mexico.  Conversly, I have tried some action shots that were quite blurry - switching back to auto mode corrected this.  Any problems I've had with this camera have been user related, not a problem with the equipment.I love the idea of interchangable lenses.  If you're not happy with the zoom capabilities of the camera, get a stronger zoom lens and you're all set.  Want to do some macro photos?  There's a lens for you out there as well.  Keep in mind, the camera itself will not fit in your pocket, and a couple of extra lenses will not either; you will need a good bag to haul the stuff around in.  When equiped with the 18-55mm lens that comes in the kit, it is no problem to strap it around your neck and take it with you wherever you roam.Also, the battery can outlast the Energizer Bunny!  We turned off the auto review feature, which extends the battery life furter.  If you wish to review a picture, all it takes is a push of the button, and you are in review mode.  Want to take another picure?  Just \"point and shoot\", when you press the shutter release to take a picture, you will automatically exit any of the menu items you may be in at the time.  If the camera goes into power save mode, just \"point and shoot\", the camera wakes up as soon as the shutter release is pressed.  When turning on the camera, it is ready to take a picture faster than you are.  The bottom line, you will never miss a picture opportunity  because you are waiting on the camera!I expect to have this camera for a very long time.  I have heard some experts say that any digital camera over 5 MP is a waste for home use, since most people will only print out 4 x 6 pictures, with the occasional 8 x 10, but it is comforting to know that I can use this camera to make much larger prints with no loss of detail.  In the long run, I think the initial cost of the camera will be worth it - it should outlast even the best P & S cameras seveal times over.After having owned this camera for a little over a year now, I can find no faults with it.  I recommend this camera to anyone who wishes to make \"shutter lag\" a thing of the past.", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Magic in your hand", "Author": "Mark Bookworth \"MB\"", "ReviewID": "RCN9F32NA0B0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have the cash to spare and love taking photos there is only one thing to know.  Buy a 20D.  As soon as possible.  You will be thrilled.  There is no doubt that it is among the best cameras the world has ever seen.  I did my research before deciding to buy a 20D.  I looked seriously at the Nikon D70, another excellent digital SLR camera and a fair bit cheaper than the 20D, but I chose the 20D for its ruggedness, slightly larger 8mp sensor, and outstanding autofocus.What is amazing about this camera?  Put it on automatic and squeeze the shutter release.  In a second you have taken 5 shots.  You can take 20 in four seconds, each 8 megapixels in size while the autofocus tracks your running toddler.  It feels GREAT in your hand, very sturdy and not overly heavy.  Perhaps  a tad bulky compared to the digital camera you may be used to.  But I find it a joy to hold and use.It can speed up to ISO 3200 without introducing excessive noise into the image and at 1600 and 800, noise is almost unnoticeable.  That means you can take handheld photos without flash indoors in the evening under ambient room light conditions (the 50mm mentioned below, with its large maximum aperture helps too in this regard).You could spend days researching lenses and accessories.  If you are just wading in to high-end amateur photography, let me make some quick and dirty suggestions:The kit lens (EF-S 18-55mm) is a very good lens for the insanely cheap price of $100.  The EFS 17-85 which pros rave about is pricey at $600 and you don't need the 55-85 range much I find -- you will probably consider a decent telephoto (like a 70-300mm) to be a better use of your cash.  You may well grow tired of the 18-55 eventually, but it does give you access to wide angle shots at a cheap price.You absolutely MUST buy the ($75) 50mm f1.8.  It is a truly outstanding lens for headshots and portraits.  It has fantastic depth of field control allowing you to achieve a nice background blur, and is very very sharp within the depth of field.  You will use this lens a lot.  Some say it's cheaply made.  Probably, but it works wonders and the price is definitely right.  50mm was standard on analog SLRs supposedly due to its rough equivalence to how the human eye observed a scene.  On the 20D it becomes an 80mm lens due to the 1.6x crop factor, and at that length becomes the perfect portrait lens in my view.If you want to photograph ships, houses and palaces, the EF-S 10-22mm f3.5 is a treasure that'll set you back $800.  It's definitely not a good general purpose lens, but how cool is it to have a wide angle zoom?You do NOT need a high speed compact flash card, but you DO need a big one.  If you have a 4x 512MB CF, keep it and it will work well with the 20D.  A 256MB card will fill up pretty fast as you will become addicted to firing off several shots at once.  Sure the 1GB cards are down in price considerably, but don't throw out your old 256 or 512s.  The buffer on the 20D is very large, and will transfer the images from the camera to the card during idle time quite happily.  Of course if you want to run off 30 images in 6 seconds, go for the ultra or 80x cards.  You don't need my advice either.Buy it and love it.

The 20D is also my second SLR, my first SLR I still have after 23 years, but more for sentimental reasons, these days.I did a lot of research before deciding on this camera.  Original research started about a year before the purchase, but, at that time did not have a need for DSLR until now.  My primary reason for going to DSLR is for the low-noise as it is very important for astrophotography.Similar to another reviewer, I also considered the 350D and the Nikon D70.  I had some advantage regarding the D70 as my brother owns one.  The heated decision came between the 350D and the 20D.  Size/weight were only a minor consideration for me, but I really did like the metal body of the 20D.  I found sites with samples of astrophotos from the 350D as well as the D70.  The D70 has an inherent heat problem for long exposures and develops a \"hot area\" in the upper left portion of the images.  The noise reduction it has is effective for reducing this, but I just didn't like the fact that it existed.  Comparing 350D results to 20D, well, one would be pressed to notice the differences.  However, in looking closely at review sites (such as dpreview), even they admitted the clarity on the 20D edged out the 350D (what is nice, you can see for yourself in their images).  No, not a big difference at all, but I am wanting the best of the 2 at this point.In the end, my decision was for the 20D mostly because this is the very camera Canon themselves used to create a camera purely for astrophotography - the 20Da.  My thought is, if Canon chose this, there is a reason.  I did not want the 20Da, however, as I plan to use the 20D for \"normal\" shooting, as well...but I was sold on the 20D.Having used it for more than a week, I put it through some gruesome tests...including, of course, long exposures.  I wanted to check for hot pixels at 30 sec exposures.  The short version is: I checked with the Canon 5D results on dpreview and my results are on par with it...and the 5D price is nearing 3 times the 20D price.Also, in more tests, I have found the 20D noise reduction has improved (I am guessing with the newer firmware my camera has) over what the results are on the dpreview site.Oh, and of course (for fun) I compared results from the point and shoots I have/have had.  I still have results from my A40 and S1 and, at ISO400 the point and shoots are blown so far out of the water you just can't find them.I am a very happy person.

Well, I've now tried both and here's my assessment of the 20d.What I like about this camera:- Very fast all the way around- Nice look and size to the camera- 8MP CMOS sensor is great- I generally like the Canon lenses better than Nikon'sWhat needs improvement:- Flash pictures are very often underexposed and not consistent- Mirror click is louder than on previous models, making unobtrusive shots difficult- 18-55mm lens in kit looks and feels cheap- Camera seems to lock up often (probably an early firmware bug that will be fixed)Overall a camera with great potential, but I'm going to go with the D70 until Canon fixes the flash and lockup issues.  The flash is probably the deal-killer for me - it takes worse flash pictures than my Canon S400, especially for quick, casual shots (a $1500 camera should do better!).  The D70 is a mature camera and has no such problems (even though it's not quite as fast).I'm going to hold on to my Canon lenses and hope for a fix or wait for the next version.", "Date": "September 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "The lens in the kit  isn't so bad!", "Author": "Barefoot Graphics \"KS\"", "ReviewID": "R1HESGXSC1KUKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the D20!! The lens that comes with the kit is not as bad as posted. Look above at pics I posted last night in the photo share area above.  It is really what you do with it.  It is small, light weight, which is a plus. It isn't an L lens, but it is worth having fun finding it's plus's.  It is a fun lens to start out with if you have just started your Canon lens collection and have no other lens to work until you get better.  Someone just starting with an SLR camera could do fine with this set, or with the Rebel XT and this lens. I just purchased the Canon 70-300 IS USM DO Zoom Lens and haven't had time to really put it to the test yet, but so far I really like the size and am looking forward to investigating its abilities and possibilities for the Motocross track.  So if you are wondering if you should purchase just the body or the kit, I would say if you are starting with Canon and don't have a wide zoom lens as yet, don't be swayed by the pros to not buy the kit.  For an extra $70, the kit is great and you will always have a pretty good little, light weight, backup. I have used it for a week while waiting for my new lenses to arrive and have had a great time. The camera of course has been alot of the fun too.  I started with the Rebel XT.  At first, I thought I wanted a smaller camera, but then found that the bigger lenses made holding the XT too hard for a long time.  My hands are not big, I am a lady, but it still didn't feel right, so I exchanged it for the D20.  I am glad I did.  I love the ease of use and changing settings as I think it is easier than the Rebel.  Also the D20 is faster and I have really noticed that.  As for the kit lens, if you are going to walk around for a long time and don't want to have the weight of a richer lens sometimes, this will work quite well as it is an 18-55, which is a nice range for just fun stuff.

J McCartin", "ReviewID": "R1XLP6CLAQ4Y0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been shooting with a Digital Rebel for about a year, that camera is great but it just plain doesn't have big enough onboard memory buffers for the kind of fast action I tend to shoot. This camera, when coupled with a high speed Compact Flash card will rarely bog down and quit shooting when using continuous mode (5 fps) (even more so if you aren't shooting in full quality mode since more frames fit in the buffers). The difference between this baby and the Rebel is like the difference between a Yugo and a Cadillac, just no comparison!  The Rebel is a starter camera, this is a real camera.  There are three different metering modes, three different types of AF and single and continuous shooting modes available in all \"creative modes\" (i.e. other than the stock modes they give you for common situations and of course in auto mode). I haven't had a chance to shoot a whole lot with the 20D yet but so far I'd say it's much faster (both on startup and between shots) than the Rebel and much more capable in \"mixed-lighting\" situations than the Rebel is. With the rebel, the combination of mercury vapor gymnasium lighting and flash would give my shots these awful yellow backgrounds, so far the 20D is handling this situation in a superior manner--i.e. no annoyingly colored backgrounds (Auto White Balance control is much better here).  If you use IS lenses I suggest you buy the battery grip. The 20D is made of metal and much more ergonomic than the Rebel but someone with big hands will probably still like the battery grip to make the camera easier to hold onto. The built in flash on the 20D is capable but for real shooting you'll want a professional flash. Canon speedlights (550/580EX) are the most integrated but there are other cheaper choices that are just as good (but may not be as integrated).  The 20D has a flash sync port on the side for a \"potato masher\" handle style flash unit such as made by Metz, Sunpak, etc.  This is a pricey camera for most of us but worth the money, I am going to have a lot of fun with this.  One last comment: The 20D apparently incorporates some advanced circuitry that operates with the flash to conserve flash power, it's my impression this is more refined on the 580EX than the 550EX but on my first shoot I did notice far less misfires with the 550EX on this camera than on the Rebel.  If you're torn between jumping on a Rebel or saving for a 20D then save for the 20D it's more than twice the camera the Rebel is and if you shoot fast moving sports you won't be happy with the Rebel Original, the XT is supposedly a bit improved but I still don't believe they've done very much about improving the image buffers and that is where the 20D shines.

I think of all the shots that I've missed because of shutter lag once you go digital SLR you will not go back.One thing about purchasing a digital SLR that you need to keep in mind is.  It's all about the lenses!  If you're buying this camera do yourself a favor get a good piece of glass.  I will have links to sites that have reviews of lenses.This thing will take 24 shots in a row.  That is just so great!  With the 8.2 megapixel, you can print 36 x 24 perfectly.  The images are just huge.  One thing I do like also with his camera, as opposed to the digital rebel.  Is that you can capture a JPEG high Quality and raw image simultaneously.  Now I don't use raw images very much yet, but I will of the future I'm sure.  the rebel is raw and normal quality pictureOne other thing I would recommend in relation to this camera is drop a couple dollars on a good flash.  I've just started recently using an external flash the 580 EX and I must say lighting is where it is at!Now, should you get the Canon 20 D. with the included lens it depends, the lens package is only $100 more.  And it's an okay lens, but the other ones in the Canon family are way better.Info on crop factor-------------------------------What happens, if I understand things correctly, is that a full size sensor capture the same amount of data as a 35mm film would. A sensor with a 1.3 factor means that the 35mm film area is 1.3 times as large as the sensor, and the same with a 1.6 sensor.Think of it as simply chopping off some of the data that a 35mm full-frame sensor would capture. Imagine a ruler, where the 35mm camera would capture the full 12\" stretching across the frame. If you then put a 1.3 sensor camera in the same location and took the same picture (assuming the same lens, camera mounted on the same tripod in the same location relative to the ruler) the camera's picture would only show the middle 9 inches (approximately). Now if both cameras produce the same size files, e.g. 8MB pictures, you have one picture at 8MB showing a full 12 inches and one picture at 8MB showing only the middle 9 inches. If you print them both at the same size, the picture taken with the 1.3 sensor will appear to be larger.However, full-frame sensor cameras usually shoot larger MB pictures, so you lose the 1-to-1 relationship between the two pictures. The full-frame cameras shoot at 12MB or larger, so if you then crop THAT image to be 8MB in size by chopping the outer 1/3 (1/6 from each edge) and you will see the same thing as you see with the 1.3 sensor.So it's not really that the 1.3 sensor magnifies the image, it just APPEARS to magnifiy the image. And since in photography it really is all about appearances, in one sense it does magnify things. But not actually, when everything is put on a 1-to-1 basis, the image isn't actually larger.What that crop factor DOES do, though, is to reduce the size of the image you can get with the same lens. That means that you either have to move back if using the same lens to get the same field of view, or you have to use a shorter lens to get the same field of view from the same location.That is where the 1.3 factor or 1.6 factor becomes important in deciding how to shoot a scene, especially for people who are coming to digital from the film world. So when you put your 50mm lens on a 20D, it becomes effectively a 80mm lens (50mmx1.6=80), with the reduced field of view that an 80mm lens would give. So to get the same field of view that you would get with a 50mm lens on a 35mm film body, you need to put a 32mm lens on a 20D body if you are standing in the same spot as with the film camera.Again, since what we see is of utmost importance in photography, you are actually seeing a magnified image, when both images are printed straight to paper. But if the images are made to be the same size by cropping the larger file to equal the smaller file, there isn't really magnification.-----------------------------------just fyiOkay, hope this helps have some fun-and-get-it-done!", "Date": "November 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Picture Magic in McFarland", "Author": "R.

The main takeaway for an amateur is that if you choose to learn a lot more about photography, you're not going to need to upgrade your camera to keep up -- it's there and waiting for you to advance.But forgetting all that, there are two good reasons for stepping up to this camera over the lesser consumer ones (if you can afford it) even if you're never going to use all those features.1. Picture quality -- absolutely awesome.  Even if you do nothing more than learn what 3 or 4 of the different point and shoot modes do, you'll feel like a pro with the quality of images that come out of this.  There's one dial to turn to choose your mode -- you can keep it on the all purpose green mode, or switch to a portrait (which gives that cool blurred background look), or sports mode, or night mode.  There are a couple others, but these are the main ones I use.  The images are simply far superior to anything I took with mid-range cameras ($500ish) in the past.2. Speed.  My biggest complaint with lesser cameras is the time it takes (1) to turn on, (2) from pressing the shutter to getting the picture (the kids are in a different spot than when I started the picture) and (3) the write time between pictures.  Those are completely solved with this camera.  It turns on right away.  The \"shutter lag\" (2) is negligible.

My Olympos 3000Z has 2.0' screen, this one has only 1.8', of course its resolution is higher than Olympos 3000Z. Another reason I give it 4 stars is that I feel the power switch is not in the convenient location.

I have consistently been able to reproduce this problem with the rebel 300, rebel 350 and the 20D.3. Sharpening algorithm looks almost same as what is used in the compact powershot models.4. No spot metering - was this a hugely complex thing to incorporate? Canon responds to most complaints by \"well, you have options to do things manually...\". but at the same time, they leave out spot metering which is by far the most dependable manual feature when doing macro photography.Agreed these are not too many shortcomings.

Publications \"Books\"", "ReviewID": "R2KIVTZBEW1MWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read both positive a negative reviews about the 20D and there seems to be a theme among bad reviews that the user complains about poor picture quality, that their standard point and shoot produces better images and how they couldn't just pick the 20D up and create professional pictures.  Quit frankly I agree with these reviews to a certain extent but it is not the fault of the camera...it is the unrealistic expectations of the user that they are going to buy a high performance tool and suddenly become a professional photography without learning how to use it.  They want to simply push the shutter button and produce pictures they can sell.  Come on people...let's be realistic.  Expecting professional level photos just because you buy a high end camera is about as unrealistic as thinking you can play professional baseball because you purchase a Rawlings Gold Glove.I am by no means a professional, but I do like to take nice pictures.  I was the same as many people that were frustrated when I bought the 20D, broke it out of the box and hit the shutter to find out that my point and shoot appeared to take better pictures.  But rather than figuring I wasted my money on useless camera I did something many people refuse to do...I read the owners manual.  After taking a Saturday to read the manual from cover to cover, playing with the settings and learning a little bit about lenses, I tried the 20D again.  Understanding the settings, lightning requirements for various lenses and the functions of the camera I was able to make vast improvements with the pictures taken.  This time the pictures were clear and crisp, colors were strong and I was able to plug them into Photoshop and work with them to create some fun additions.  As I used my camera more, I learned how to use the various modes in different light settings, which allowed me to take pictures in virtually any environment.  Since one of the main complaints of many 20D reviews is its limitation in low light environments, I expected this to be a weakness of the camera.  This was not the case. What I found to be a bigger issue in regards to dark pictures is the lens.  If you are using cheap entry level lenses then yes, you are going to have more difficulty adjusting to lighting.  But if you use a good solid lens (it doesn't have to be an L Series) like a 50mm 1.8 or 1.4, then you can effectively shoot in just about any lighting.  From the reviews I read it seemed the reviewers were dinging the camera when really they were just too cheap to purchase to buy decent quality lens that would have provided them then balanced lighting, crisp images and clear colors they were seeking.  The proper lenses make a world of difference.  For those that don't believe me, go to your local photography rental company and rent an L Series lens for the weekend (should cost you about $25).  You'll be amazed by the results you get in your pictures.  Think of your camera like a car.  If you purchased a Porche, is it going to preform better with standard tires from Walmart or with racing tires?  Yes, you can put cheap tires on your car and it will roll around...but you will notice the true abilities of the car if you equip it properly.  Same thing with the 20D.  If you go cheap...you will get cheap pictures.  If you equip it properly then you will see a huge difference. If you have the money to purchase a $1000 camera, don't expect professional results by putting a $50 lens on it. Make sense?The biggest strength of the 20D is the sports photography that you can do with it.  The pictures are beautiful.  With a 5 frame per second shutter burst you can freeze a baseball as it hits the batter's bat.  I use a telephoto Canon lens that I got off Ebay for $300 to take sports pictures and the results are fantastic.  I have taken pictures at all levels of sports, from youth up to professional, with beautiful results.I have been using my 20D for about 6 months and the bottom line is practice, practice, practice.  Like any other tool, the more you use it, the better you will get with it.  Although I only take pictures as a hobby, after just 6 months of owning my camera I would be willing to put my pictures taken with my 20D up against some professional photographers that use more high end and more current models of cameras.  The pictures come out that clear and crisp.  If you are looking at being able to pick up the camera and use it like a \"point-n-shoot\" then the 20D may not be for you.  I like to tell people, \"if you want to 'take' pictures then get a point and shoot.  If you want to 'make' pictures then the 20D will serve you well.\"", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "As close to nirvana as a hunk of technology can take you.", "Author": "T.

Soccer is easier to shoot from an available light perspective, harder from a large field to cover with a lens perspective. Volleyball (like basketball) is diabolical from an available light perspective. Indoor gymnasium lights are horrible at best. Setting a \"custom white balance\" is optimal, although the 20D AWB does pretty well in many gyms.  You need to use high ISO settings (typically 1600, sometimes 3200 in a dim gym), and large apertures (f 2.8) to get shutter speeds that begin to freeze the on-court action.  It was the shooting demands of indoor volleyball that led me to the Canon 20D.  Even at high ISO settings the 20D has acceptably low image noise.Its second winning attribute is its speed. It has very little shutter lag (~65ms with preset exposure and focus).  I briefly owned a Digital Rebel 300D. It's shutter lag was considerably longer. Especially given the 300D lack of a custom function to allow focusing on demand (CF-4 set so '*' button locks focus). This custom function is the secret to shooting action sports.  The 20D focuses  quickly and on demand. (It focuses much faster than the 300D and orders of magnitude faster than a point 'n shoot digital camera I started with). It has a very fast burst rate of 5 frames/second. (But, don't count on fast bursts to catch the action! Even at 5 fps I have shot sequences in which the ball never appears in any of the frames of a hard driven \"spike\" in volleyball!  The ball enters and exits the frame in < 1/5 of a second!  You still have to learn to time your shots for that kind of action.)I probably should have bought the \"body only\". The kit lens is useless for indoor sports. I occasionally use it for a large group shot in tight quarters. But for action sports the \"kit lens\" is virtually useless. It is too slow, and the shrinking aperture as you zoom in, makes it difficult to set a fixed exposure.  For volleyball I shoot with two alternate lens, both of which I can highly recommend). I use a Tamaron 28-75 F2.8 when I can get close to the sidelines and a Canon 70-200 F2.8 for when I'm on the end lines or up in the bleachers. Both lens have a constant aperture when zooming.

I paid big bucks for the camera plus the lens, about $1400 at the time. It is a shock to find out that this expensive machine is now only worth about maybe $300, used.I have gotten a lot of good use out of it, however. My photography skills have improved with the availability of the custom features that this camera offers. While it has a good selection of point-and-shoot options, I have not been using them. They work quite well, but so do the selections for manual settings, and when used correctly, these manual settings make for creative photography. I recently bought a large format printer, and I have been blowing up photos shot from this camera to 11\" x 17\" images. I had shot the photos from a tripod, and the details even at that extreme size are sharp and vivid.The 17 to 85 mm IS lens that I bought with the camera has turned out to be versatile and useful. It is able to take moderate macro photos, and its wide angle feature is something that a lot of camera buyers would not specifically look for, but when you have it, it is wonderful to take wide pictures outdoors.If I could change the camera, there are two things that bug me: one is that the viewfinder is not 100% of what comes through the lens, so that if you focus tightly on a subject, when you see the image on your computer there is extra real estate around the edges that you did not plan to put in the picture. The other problem is the LCD screen in the back. If you are shooting outdoors, it is very nearly impossible to see what you have on the LCD screen. I guess it just isn't bright enough.Neither of these problems are bad enough for me to take a star off my rating. On the plus side, this camera takes very good pictures in low light situations. While there is, in fact, some noise at ISO 1600, it is not enough to ruin the photo the way it does on so many other cameras. It is great for taking pictures in theaters with the lights low without a flash. The flash itself is powerful, and if you like using a flash, then this is a good one.One of the features that I most appreciate is the ability for the camera to shoot in RAW mode. When I first got the camera, I shot JPEG's. However, as I became more familiar with the RAW feature, I began to appreciate it more. Also, over the years, Adobe has greatly improved its camera RAW application. Now I would not dream of shooting anything other than RAW, because of the ability to adjust your picture before converting it to a JPEG or TIFF. In Adobe camera RAW, you can open your picture in either 8-bit mode or 16 bit mode, and you can also open it in either a small or huge size and several sizes in between. I consider this to be a great advantage.If you are new to photography, or on a tight budget, I would highly recommend this camera.

The plastic body of the 300D just doesn't feel as good as the metal body of the 20D. But the main reason I got this is for the low noise photos at high ISO settings.You cannot use the LCD as a viewfinder. This is probably the case with all digital SLRs (I've only tried a few - the reviews usually assume you already know about such things and don't mention it). This means you'll not be able to take well framed shots from strange angles.Finally, be prepared to spend a lot more. The 18-55 EF-S is an okay lens, but you'll soon start wishing for more. A kit with the EF-S 18-85 IS USM will be a better value - but I can't seem to find it anywhere.Anyway, be prepared to spend a lot more. An extra battery or two (few things worse than a digital camera with no power), lenses (unless you already have a good collection of Canon lenses), filters, flash. The good thing is, other than the battery, you don't need to rush out and buy all the rest of it now. This is a camera to grow into as you learn, and you can pick up a piece or two as you go on. And the major investment - the lenses - will continue to serve you as you upgrade the camera body 3 to 5 years down the road.Don't throw (or eBay) that compact digital camera away. You'll still need it for the times when a bulky camera is not convenient.

I really didn't want the video capabilities of the newer bodies.This body is easy to use if you have ever used a Canon film camera, which is the background I have, then you will have no problem switching to this camera. Most functions can be found where you would expect them, you can set the camera to use the half push on the shutter, or the back focus button. Handy if you are shooting subjects where you can freeze the focus, and you just want to meter the light.If you want a camera for low light, or as it is also called high iso, buy a newer model. The high iso performance of this camera is very noisy and requires a lot of post.The lens:The lens I am less satisfied with.  I find it has problems focusing, especially in low light. When I take it of AF these issues are gone, but the you have to deal with the focus ring.  With this lens it is way on the front of the lens, there is about 4mm of plastic.  I am a tall guy with big hands, and find myself grabbing the wrong part of the lens to focus often.  This is an a minor setback, especially when you get sharper pictures using MF.I am currently looking into which lenses to buy, I will retire the kit lens after I buy different lenses.  I don't even want to sell it because of the issues mentioned above. I will just hang on with it and give it to my daughter when she gets her DSLR body.References: For more information on me find me by searching Berry van der Linden for my flickr search for madberry", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Versatile Machine Is Easy To Use", "Author": "John St John", "ReviewID": "R2HU0KMWRNOMX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "High-end cameras and other similar machines often suffer from a common fault.

Coupled with the 17-85 IS lens I can take indoor and other low-light shots that I've never been able to do before, and photography has been my hobby for decades.Early reviews of this camera mentioned a louder-than-normal shutter release.  I don't notice it.  In fact, the sound of the release, like everything else on this camera, says \"quality.Having said this, I do have one complaint.  The AWB (auto white balance) is terrible in incandescent lighting.  You absolutely must set the WB to tungsten if you're going to shoot indoors without flash.  Even then your images will be orange.

Same goes for Macro mode - Spot metering is just so dear to macro photographers that it is very dissappointing not to have it in such an expensive camera.If you can afford more than one camera (as most professionals do), then yes, get this camera for your sports and outdoor shooting needs and get a different one for doing your indoor, lowlight and macro shooting needs.But if you are on a budget like most of us and if you are not going to limit yourself to just sports and outdoor photography, then in my opinion, you would be better off with a different camera - I vote for D70 too.

I used the 20D for sports photography for the local paper as well as for pleasure/artistic photography.Let's start off with the strengths.  The camera is built like a tank.  Not a cheap plastic job.  Some people complain that the battery door is a little feeble but I've never had a problem with it in 8 years.The controls are well laid out.  It's very easy to change the ISO and to shoot aperture or shutter speed priority.  The menu system is easy to use and has all the controls a semi professional could use.Image quality is very good.  Good in low light, with usable shots up to 1600 ISO and perhaps 3200 ISO if you're pushing it.  The pop up flash works well as a fill flash.  The quality of the image is very dependent on the quality of the lens.  I've used some sharp prime lenses with great results, good results with better than average zooms.  Battery life is excellent.If I had only a few minor nitpicks I would say that the camera is heavy.  Very heavy to haul around all day on your neck.  Buy a good quality strap.  Lately I've been using a 40mm Canon pancake lens to keep the weight down with very good results.  Also, the 20D takes a CF card.  These days, most people would prefer SDHC card usage.If you can pick this camera up in the used market (cams in excellent shape go for $200-$300), then I would say your getting a great deal.  Don't get too worried about the fact it doesn't have 18 megapixels...the images stand up well to any other camera.  The better the glass, the better result.

Many of my peers were still using film, as was I. When the 300D came out, I decided what the hell... It was a bargain, and I wanted a digital camera for personal purposes (family photos, vacation photos, etc) so I bought one. After a few months of using it, I soon realized the potential of digital.When the 20D came out, I was already comfortable shooting digital, but my pro work was still film-based. Within a month of the announcement of the 20D, I purchased one. And that camera changed my professional photography career for life.It was fast, light, and felt really good in the hand. Image quality was superb, easily surpassing anything Nikon was making at the time (aside from the expensive and huge D2X). The 20D was the camera that made me give up film, for good. Photos from the 20D easily surpassed what 35mm was capable of, all factors considered.A high resolution scan of a low grain film scan (i.e. Velvia) could produce a bit more detail than a 20D raw file, but the 20D file were much cleaner (less noise/grain). Plus the 20D file had more latitude, which is useful for post production work in Photoshop. Comparing a 20D file to a film scan from a faster ISO film (e.g. ISO 200 and above) was no contest -- the 20D files were, simply put, WAY better, in all aspects.Today, the 20D might seem outdated, but I think it still has its uses. I still use mine every now and then when I need an extra camera. I recently used it during an event I shot in which I needed a 4th body (there was no budget to rent a body) which was mounted to the ceiling and remotely triggered. I also used it in a partially submerged fish tank for some underwater shots (I didn't want to risk using my higher-dollar bodies).I still license images taken with the 20D on a regular basis. I still sell 20x30 inch prints of images taken with the 20D.

This means that I am now able to get low-light shots that I never could before. For example, I often take pictures of crowded streets at night. Before, I needed to use a flash or else my shots would be blurred by camera shake and the motion of people walking.

It also writes the images to the memory card much faster than the Rebel ever did. I shot a series of 25 shots in 5 seconds, and it still had them all on the card 6 seconds after I stopped shooting.Black and White mode. Not just some toy feature, when you are saving as a JPG file (not RAW), the image is actully encoded as a B&W; image--meaning a smaller file size.

You just can't go wrong. This is hands down the best semi-pro consumer model out there. And trust me, I'm not even a pro and when I take pictures of just people at BBQ's or taking fast shots of my friends playing basketball, it's just amazing. My friends can't believe the high quality and clarity of the photos. Taking a photo of my friend dunking the basketball and freezing the picture while he is in mid-air - Now THAT'S amazing! The modes on the camera are easy enough for a point and shoot person to take great pictures but at the same time, offer so many complex options/customizations for the professional photographer that makes this camera a true winner. I totally did my research when I bought this camera and I'm glad I picked it up. I promise you that you'll love the camera too. It's a great investment and it won't be money thrown away later. Later on if technology gets better and Canon releases a better camera, then you can re-use all of your existing lenses and all you need to pick up is another body. I love it! Love the switch to Digital SLR. Can't imagine how I survived without this wonderful camera!With the 17-85mm lens, it's a deal to get it with this bundle. This lens is the best all around lens. It does everything that the basic standard $50 18-55mm lens does and more. Very good lens to have as a \"leave it on the camera and be the 1 lens you choose to have to take it around to travel or carry around with you to take pictures\". The one lens that's multi-purpose and good for all around shooting. Can't go wrong! You'll love it! It has the ultra sonic motor that's super quiet, has auto-focus capability for fast auto-focus, and has a good large wide angle for wide shots as well as a healthy zoom for close up pictures. It's made in Japan for high quality, and like a lot of other things in life, there's a reason why it's expensive and there's a reason why you get what you pay for.", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Better than my expectations", "Author": "J.B. \"Multi-\"", "ReviewID": "R15NSWAS68KL0P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all I didn't buy the camera on Amazon because they wouldn't ship it overseas while I was on military deployment. It cost about the same on B&H; from which I had no problems as a previous reviewer commented on. Another reviewer was dissapointed becuase of the Fully Auto settings?! Come on...if you pay this much for a camera why would you want to only use it for the auto settings? That person must have really had money to burn and thought that the more expensive the camera, the better pictures they'll get. I had to laugh. This camera gives really great pictures at the auto settings, but I bought it to get into the seriousness of photography, and because I owned a Canon Rebel II about ten years ago that was stolen. Since the beginning of digital photography I couldn't wait until D-SLRs with interchangeable lenses were available and I knew that they wouldn't be cheap either considering! I've taken some really good pictures with my point/shoot Sony cybershot camera, but I finally extended the possibilities of shots I was able to achieve with it, like throwing a background out of focus without getting extremly close to my subject, or lack of aperture settings or telephoto zooms. I loved my Canon Rebel II at the time, but was really a beginner when I had it and didn't understand photography as much until after it was stolen, this was the main factor for me choosing Canon instead of Nikon. The settings felt the same and remember I haven't used that camera in years and it just felt natural. Needless to say I'm getting better at photography and this camera gives me great pictures without me wasting a roll of film to see how my photos came out. Gotta love digital technology right?! If you have the dough get the camera with the 17-85mm package. Unless you're looking for super telephoto or superwide this lense will sastify you for a while on all types of photos.  One other thing I hear about is the 1.6x crop factor? Maybe it's just me but the 50mm looks like 50mms to me. I don't have a 35mm film camera to compare it with, but oh well.

I didn't like the plastic body of the Rebel XT. Also the XT size is like miniature SLR or a crossbred between point-n-shoot and SLR, it just didn't right in my hand. But, the 20D fits like the gloves in my hands. The 20d is a litle bigger than XT. It's metal is rock solid.I like to travel and take a lot of pictures of people. I thought if I have to take pictures, people will notice me of my shootings, I might as well carry the best camera that I could afford which is the 20d. I just bought mine about 3 weeks ago and I've been taking more than 3000 pictures. I use  Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM len (Made in Japan len). The IS (Image Stabilization) feature of the len is a must. Most of the my pics are very sharp. I'm still playing around with this camera. Some of my pics are blurred because I used third party flash Metz Mecablitz 45 CL-4, and it did not synch correctly for right amount of flash needed. I shot mostly in automatic (P mode) TTL flash.Since I've spent a good amount of money on the camera already, I thought I might as well invest in a good flash. I just ordered through Amazon (which prices are very competitive to Beach or Adorama, B&H;) the Canon 580EX flash. I hope this flash will do the trick.To sum up, so far so good. Very happy with my Canon 20d. The battery that comes with is amazing! I took more than 1000 pictures before I realized I need to recharged, just in case. Also the full recharge of the battery takes less than 2 hours. I plan to get the Canon BGE2 Battery Grip and extra battery set. It's not that I really need it, but I just like the beefed-up look of this camera and made me look like a pro. I'm glad I picked this one over the Rebel XT--I don't think the XT would have the extension of the battery Grip like the 20D.One more thing. Amazon.com reviews influenced me to buy this camera.

The 20D", "Author": "Sinister Minister", "ReviewID": "R1DQC78TAM4MYS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As I mentioned in my prior review after I had used this camera for a while I would try and do an update well here we go. I have just finished filling a 4GB micro-drive with the E-300, and must say that I am still in awe of this camera.I had the chance to shoot it along with a 20D as well as an XT (Canon) not my cameras but ones that belonged to friends. I still have to put the Olympus at the top. Here's why- first off I take pictures for quality not for speed, if you are the type of photographer that shoots say sporting events, or horses, etc. then no doubt the Canons are your weapon of choice, Because lets face it Canon's \"DIGIC 2\" processor is truly amazing. But speed aside picture to picture I found the E-300 to be the best as far as over all picture quality and accuracy, and with the exception of the 20D far less noise at higher ISO's. Now I shoot a wide variety of pictures from sky scenes, to low light pix, as well as something I call \"lightpainting\" wich involves turing down the shutter speed (way Down) and cranking the ISO (as high as you can stand it!) So I guess the type of pictures I take covers the gamut of situations. Again, in each situation the EVOLT blew away the 2 Canons. the most amazing thing is that out of almost 550 shots I had only about 20 where the camera (or myself) had mis-read the shot, the 20D had twice as many (due to the camera) the Xt nearly three times!By mis reading I refer to under or over exsposure, and/or blurred images. All three cameras were set to the auto or \"P\" mode. The E-300 has also made me want to try flash photography again! Flash photography is an art unto itself and the E-300 made it possible for even myself to get decent results! The flash on the 20D is completely useless as far as I could tell either it was too hot, or too weak, the Xt didn't fair much better. Now before Canon fans call me a lunatic let me explain something the 2 Canon SLR's I used are in thier own right top of the line photographic weapons, more than worthy of the high praise and reviews they have recieved from pro and novice alike. Heck- I had an Xt in my hand ready to buy, until I saw the E-300 further down the counter and decided to check it out, In fact if I was ready to buy another SLR it more than likely would be the Xt (The 20D is just too damn high priced for what you REALLY get)The reason I love the Olympus over the others is the fact that the camera takes great pictures by nature not by settings, it relys on the ability to take amazing pictures at a varitey of situations on a extremely consistant basis. The Canons alas, do not, due to the fact that they are complicated to operate (especially the 20D) and the biggest being that they are not consistant in the quality of pictures they take. This is just my opinion if you love the Canons by all means buy one, but me...I'm staying with the EVOLT. You may take pictures faster, but I'll be taking em better!

He shoots wide angle a lot and I am a rapid fire person, forever and qucikly  changing focal length who  loves to take kids without them knowing and rarely miss or use a wide angle per se. So his counter part disagreed owning both the 10 and 20 D and I followed suit and have been very impressed but at the same time also upgraded myself to the 20D lens series with the 17-85 lens and the \"L glass and Image stabiliazation\" as my guy says. The lens that comes with the camera is pretty musch garbage and should be bought with body only or with the upgrade to this fine L lens series unless wanting to go into the thousands for each lens.  The pictures have been fabulous so I am not sure how much due to the upgrade to the 20 or the upgrade of the lens.  I am dissappointed in the focal  length however as previously with an off brand but good 28-200 and  I loved the fact I could be taking the whole pool at a party or the nose of a kid and they did not know. This new lens does not provide the length I like so will now purchase the 70 to 200 but consider this a crucial point in terms of focal lentgh to  be switching lenses and with the time to switch out a lens and I  have numb hands. I am concerned it will slow down my style.  Other canon lenses are either in the thousands or lack the image stabilization or the wonderful glass quality of this new 20D series.  I will keep a new Tamaron 28 - 200 for the cases in which I feel this is the best alternative as when not needing the same quality and not wanting to change. Also as a red eye hater and I  do not care how manty photo editing programs you have,  I would only have this or any camera with the flash attachment and find my 550 from the 10d just fine. Be careful as their are items now for just the 20D and not interchangeable with the 10D and I have seen people dissappointed receiving the wrong information.  This is a fabulous camera and the sports function is a blast for making of slide shows with photos. Set the time of each photo at one second and the sliide show resembles a video and yet you have the beauty of the pictures. Buy a basic book on how to shoot what you shoot and you can not go wrong. The only way to go wrong is to not take pictures at the highest level even if you still are so excited about how wonderful it is you get more pictures at shooting at a lower level. You must buy  a good and I mean a good gig compact flash disk. ( at least one) Why brag about the price of your costco cheap gig disk with slow processing when spending the money for  a camera with quick?  Also then should of bought the lower level mega pixel any way. Let your email program condense but do not loose the ability to crop!  Take, take, take and remember that the best pros used to say of a roll of 36 you were lucky if one picture turns out good maybe two. Do not analyse your roll in playback while shooting or you will miss the next great shot but have discovered the hard to take child can easily be brought into the process by taking their picture, checking for focus and then in playback showing them how you can magnify to their eye lashes. This gets them all the time. Then they are fun and relaxed and no more mug shots as they now want to see how you can do that.  Also the joy of the garbage can. I took 450 pictures of my kids school during the halloween festivities and submit to the yearbook but my passion. Why not take so many. You should see my collectiuon of shots. 450 no way.  475 with the cropping out of individuals and garbage canning the not good.  No editing, usually just the cropping and done. Then back up and remember the pictures you print today will be gone in 30 to 40 years so the back up on disk mandatory as that wonderful scrapbook that will not have pictures most likely by the time little Johnny now 3 months has kids at 35 can be redone or the pictures still here. Keep that film camera and bring it out no matter how it hurts or feels good and take some black and white four times a year on film for archival records. Set four holidays or special days you will remember and shoot 100 of your family and items of the era. Then you will have the ones here in 300 years for your decendents.  Also if you have the disk space save those photos not quite yet saveable by your current abilities or editing software as in the future  the technology may be here to  get the horribly out of focus one you took of Julie at her first day of kindergarten as she moved too fast focused and looking good or you may learn more.  Problems in future include use of compact flash cards instead of smaller disks for memory and the fact of the pins wearing down so try and use a memory card reader vs the camera when downloading. In two years the pins on my 10 d need replacing based on there being prone to damage and bending even when careful,  so the camera with extended warranty is needing to go back to Cannon for fixing and now OK but hard to give up camera for 6 to 8 weeeks. Also when push comes to shove if you know your cannon product, no matter the level of customer the support will stand behind you, Technically if you buy from them or another rep whether online or real store and the product deficient from the start the rule of Cannon is you send it back to Cannon and even if it never worked,  you are to take for repair or send in for a refurbrished replacement. After buying a i1990 printer for $500 with a rebate of $100 and it never even printed a picture I thought I deserved a new replacement.  There is no such thing with Cannon as a \"lemon\" with a new replacement. They eventually agreed and were very quick about sticking behind their product but then I own the eos elan II e, the 10 d, the 20 d, bought the printer, was talking about a new video so who knows. At least they knew not to make mad a loyal customer but had to go to supervisor and believe nice carries more weight. The use of pictbridge color vs. Print image matching is also a concern as Canon is one of the few to stick with their own system making it a necessity to buy their printers in many cases.  Make sure to have a pict bridge printer or you will be disappointed and editing everything as with my set up the 20 d talks to my mac, the mac to my epson with print image matching but since it does not have the pict bridge functioning as well the compact flash can not \"speak\" to the printer carrt with it the inportant color or exposure information. Without a pict bridge printer to read  the quality poor unless editing constantly and with this camera this is not necessary unless you want to change in some graphical sense and not help.  This makes it impossible to easily acheive the same colors you see on your screen of your computre and also the matchiung LCD on the camera when printing.  For fun and speed the epson 4 x 6 priinter with the LCD display even though more than some counter parts  is great for those occassions as it is pictbridge and my kids love for me to take pictures at playdates or sleep overs and then i get them going on a non messy project of a scrapbook with a three hole punch into 12 by 12 paper and markers with  a yarn tie or the decorating of foam frames. This keeps the kids busy and they love going home with a framed picture or a few pages of a scrapbook and then I put my kids in a book and the kids are busy and happy for two hours. Worth the 29 cents per print.  Make sure you have  a pict bridge printer as my new i1990 great and my my brother the 800 something he loves despite using a non cannon camera of lower quality and he needs to edit too much. Looks fake but not due to printer. Good luck. Not a good customer of the 5d for me as not wide angle, you should be sold a camera for how you shoot, not just the camera. My girlfriend bought an olympus,  a fine camera, SLR,  for $3000, but portrait with slow processor and no sports mode and yet 3 sons out there stealing first all the time. Good camera, wrong fit. Tell the person who you are and how you shoot, go to a good store and then buy here if you want. Anyone ever try to use the amazon extra warranty? I have not had the occasion to use it and now knowing Cannons policy would wonder about exchanges as I know if I buy from the toys r us link the store easily takes something back whether they carry  it or not. amazon you are great in every way. i come to you instead of consumer reports or the magazines to get product information thru  customer reviews. All is well. Do not go anywhere.  Why is my sons math book $70 however. Not you I am sure. Horrible. I know so much about the printers as had to trouble shoot on my own. No cannon, apple or epson person knew about it but the reviews on amazon had others commenting so  I knew not just me. So then i get it and then the release of the info in the trades. Any one can recomend a high quality and a midrange Cannon Video?", "Date": "February 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Camera is amassing`", "Author": "Tester \"amazon tester\"", "ReviewID": "R1CC44XZ82ABRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is real a great thing and also it is good to capture the momments of your life.", "Date": "December 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality Poor", "Author": "Stephen L.
