However at the price, anyone can afford to just buy new ones if they get messed up by the wind or the sun destroys them.They would probably be better as indoor cameras, esp in a spot where they cannot be reached and therefore discovered to be fake.I dont think close inspection would reveal that they are fake without handling them.  If someone were to handle it in any way they would probably suspect something isnt right.  So in the right spot the camera's would be very convincing.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "yup, they're fake", "Author": "C.

One nice touch on these is the cable - they actually use a real co-ax cable, so it looks very real (it is real).

If you place this in a well lit area that is within arms reach, I would recommend.  However, we have it high up in a corner, and the untrained eye could not tell whether or not it's actually wired into the wall and/or would assume it's a real security camera.
