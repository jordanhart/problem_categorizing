The pictures are crisp & sharp with great over all color balance. The auto focus is very fast and accurate.  I added a \"Flipabac FG2 camera grip which greatly improved the handling.  I'd highly recommend this addition to anyone considering this camera. The Canon case (included) fits this camera like a glove and is also an excellent addition.  I found that the battery life to be quite short & would recommend purchasing a couple of spares.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Product...Great Camera for the Money", "Author": "Christina L. Martin \"health nut\"", "ReviewID": "R38X2EXW72BF70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We used our S80 Cannon for years, but it finally gave out.  After trying a Nikon, we decided that Cannon was our brand, but we wanted to hold out for the new Cannon that came out just this year. However, after reading the reviews on the new Cannon, we decided that this S110 model was really the best value for the money.  The screen is large enough to view while videos or pictures are being taken, and the setting buttons are intuitive.  You can upgrade the memory card, because 8 GB is just not enough.  The leather case is also really convenient because my husband carries the camera in his pocket to any event we think our kids might \"do something memory worthy.\"  The shutter speed is also considerably better than the older versions.  Overall, it's a great camera for the average user.  We expect it will last 7 years, just like the S80 did. In fact, the old camera would have probably continued for several more years if our boys (ages 7 and 6) hadn't gotten into a play boxing match (with adult boxing gloves) while holding the camera.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best in Class", "Author": "Tony Chang", "ReviewID": "RDG8ZJQLJXOLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 4-year-old Canon SD1000 has been getting long-in-the-tooth so I've been researching replacements. As much as I wanted a mirror-less interchangeable lens camera, I couldn't justify the cost for my casual use. I did want something that would take better quality pictures than an iPhone camera. I narrowed my choices to the Canon S110 and the Sony RX100 and I ended up choosing the Canon since I'm already familiar with the menu system and the cost was significantly less than the Sony. I've only played around with it for a week and I'm not disappointed. It takes great pictures in Auto mode, and has enough options to keep my photography skills challenged for the next several years.When I ordered, this Kit was the same cost as the camera alone. The case is not a perfect fit (I would have preferred the PSC-900 case), but it's serviceable. I didn't use the 8GB SD card and ordered a Sony 32GB card instead.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "easy to use, great pictures!", "Author": "nicole", "ReviewID": "R257RMWWE18KFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!

Lunsford", "ReviewID": "R15KN9Z640YHM1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The memory card is a piece of junk and  gives \"memory card error\" which means you must shut your camera off and restart it. When you do this, you lose ALL images and ALL video. The camera case does not even fit the camera and if you use it, you will damage your camera. The camera itself is great, except for in movie mode, which is where it makes a horrible knocking sound from start to finish because of the auto focus. Great quality, if you don't mind the distracting and VERY audible knocking sound throughout your entire movie!", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": "Kit includes:\nCanon PowerShot S110 Silver 12.1 Megapixel Digital Camera\nOriginal Canon Case\n8Gb Sd Card", "Name": "Canon PowerShot S110 Digital Camera Kit - Silver - with 8GB SD Card & Canon Leather Case PSC-3200", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HQ4QMPDpL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009VGRUDE"}}
