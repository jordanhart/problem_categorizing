Oh ya, and a good camera!Using the E-10 is functioning on a whole different plane than anything I've used before (digitally, Kodak and Sony in the $800 - $900 range).  The control is total.  The product is eye-popping.  What pictures!  I'm producing 13x19 inch prints of amazing clarity.  And although there is still quite a bit of effort involved - the comfort level and the amount of ultimate control over the product is astounding.  And it all starts with the E-10.To the hand, the fit and feel are unmistakably that of a 35mm SLR.  Of course, there is no f-ring, and no gnarled knob dedicated to shutter speed control - too bad, I thought at first.  But with some adjustment to thinking, there is an easy (actually, easier!), total control of these functions - and so much more.  The zoom and focus rings are the smoothest I've ever used (and I have a couple of lenses for my 35mm that cost more than this camera).I also have the 0.8x and the 1.45x lens attachments, for wide and telephoto (or 28mm and 200mm, respectively, in a 35mm format camera).  Lens extenders exaggerate chromatic aberrations, flares and distortions - and they certainly reduce the speed of the lens fairly dramatically, among other things.  Regarding the Camedia extenders, though there is a reduction in speed, it's absolutely negligible.  And for image quality, I performed some tests photographing newspaper (a great test pattern, believe it, or not) and found nothing to complain about - quite the opposite.  This is really good stuff.  Not perfect, but very, very good.  The quality of the lens on the camera, on the other hand, may as well be perfect.  Similar, but more precise tests performed against this lens just made me smile.  There are some flares and barreling under certain circumstances, but nothing - absolutely nothing to complain about.  The contrast and brightness-uniformity (condensing) of the image are as good as you can get without spending a lot, like on some of Canon's Flourite lenses.Overall, the experience is just great.  The designers thought of everything.  This E-10 is easier to use, and fits the hand better than any professional grade camera I've ever used.Just a couple more notes:  The optical viewfinder is bright.  The shutter release is perfect for handheld, low shutter speed shots in that it requires only a very light touch (but there is good travel to prevent premature release).  The CCD is noise-free at any contrast (some owners claim noise at higher contrast settings, but I haven't experienced this.  Perhaps, Olympus had dealt with this by the time I purchased mine).  The LCD monitor really comes in handy with its multi-position feature - in making waist level and over-head shots.  Olympus suggests that this camera will eliminate the need to ever return to film format cameras.  I definitely agree.  Digital photography really is a revolution.  And this particular camera really is the beginning of the revolution as far as cost/quality combination is concerned.This is a great camera.", "Date": "January 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "Film is dead --- long live digital", "Author": "digerati \"digerati\"", "ReviewID": "R27HU69X124WLM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had a Minolta SLR for the past 10 years and been very happy with it, but after buying the my \"other half\" a Canon Digital Elph, I found the ability to immediately review photographs compelling. So, I looked for a digital SLR.Olympus has hit the price/performance sweet spot with this camera. Competitive digital SLRs cost 50% more than the E10 for the body alone -- i.e. before you've bought any lenses. However, I was concerned that the E-10 would be an adequate replacement for my film SLR. So, The E-10 passed with flying colors.What's good about this camera: terrific image quality, great lens (f2.0-f2.6!), all the control you could want (white balance, focus, zoom, exposure, flash), support for compact flash and smart media, and ability to take up to 4 shots in rapid succession, easy upload of images to a PC, Adobe Photoshop LE included and good battery life on Olympus NiMH AA batteries.I took scores of pictures every day and was generally pleased with the results. The camera functions well in program mode, but immediate image review on the camera enables you to use more control if you don't get the shot you need. And with digital, you can just keep on taking shots until you get it right without worrying about film.The ability to take 4 shots in rapid succession is useful when trying to capture spontaneous events -- like the procession of flag throwers (a Tuscan tradition that goes back over 700 years) out for a practice early one Sunday in Siena. Other digital cameras have big problems with both \"shutter lag\" (time from pressing the button to capturing the image) and the interval between shots -- especially with a 4 megapixel CCD where images take longer to write to flash.I made extensive use of a polarizing filter to cut glare under the Tuscan sun, and the images came out with strong colors as a result. The E10 seems a little \"flatter\" in its color balance than Canon cameras, but color saturation can be easily tweaked in Photoshop if this is a problem for any given image.I never managed to run the Olympus AA NiMH batteries (purchased separately) flat during a day's shooting, so camera power consumption seems to be excellent -- short battery life is a killer for many digital cameras.The lens is very impressive. It has a great zoom range, and as the camera was designed for digital from the ground up there are none of the multiplying effects of film cameras converted for digital use (e.g. Canon D30). This means that the E10 has great short-range capability as well as telephoto without having to switch lenses. This is very important if you want to travel light, as I did.What's not-so-good: problems with IBM Microdrive, autofocus requires care to avoid misfocus errors, viewfinder image location leads to orientation errors, general operation could be a lot faster, and the optional Olypus case is poor.The E10 requires the photographer to carefully monitor whether it has successfully locked on the subject. Early on, I got several poorly focused shots because the AF didn't focus on the subject. It's easy to miss this in the viewfinder or on the LCD image preview -- you only find out when you get home... However, once you learn to watch for mistaken AF lock, it is possible to re-focus and avoid this. Still, after Minolta's exemplary AF system, this was an unpleasant surprise.I also used an IBM Microdrive with my E10, but discovered that it does not work properly. I would be able to take several photographs, and then the camera would suddenly complain of flash card errors. It's easy to miss candid shots when you're wondering why the camera isn't working, then realizing there's a flash error, switching to smart media... so the Microdrive went back. Get a 256MB flash card instead.The viewfinder image is large and oddly focused -- it's easy to tilt the camera about a degree and not notice -- until you get to image review. This can be fixed in Photoshop, but it's annoying to have to fix it.Finally, the Olympus feels slower than many point-n-shoot cameras, and this is likely down to the embedded processor used in the camera. It takes several seconds before an image can be previewed, and it is slow to move around in image preview mode. Also, it seems to take a long time to compress an image and store it to flash. The 4 image buffer dramatically reduces the impact of this, but not entirely -- especially when you want to take one photo and see how it came out straight away.Finally, don't buy Olympus' case for the E10. It is very cumbersome and you'll end up wishing you never brought it. I left it at home or in the car most days. You cant open up the case and leave it hanging off the camera -- it gets in your way. That means you have to totally remove the camera from the case and either put it down, stuff it in a bag or squash it under your arm while you try to take photographs.The net is that I can't see why I'd go back to a film SLR. Although the Olympus E10 has its quirks, and Microdrive incompatibility is a drawback, it is a very good digital camera at an excellent price point for the value you receive. Olympus really doesn't have any competition for the money.", "Date": "June 21, 2001"}, {"Title": "The good, bad but no ugly", "Author": "Melvin T. Bliss", "ReviewID": "RRUQV67Y2RYIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own several Nikon 35mms, a Kodak DC 260 and the E-10. Most of the time I carry the E-10 as my primary camera and use the DC260 for point and shoot.I've seen some criticisms about the E-10s auto focus in low light. This condition exists in most digital cameras not just the E-10. The only real negative that I can complain about is the TTL view finder. It's just a little too close to the body. To protect the LCD I use a clear Palm Pilot screen overlay. This keeps grease and dirt off of the screen and provides a scratch resistant surface.On the plus side, it feels just like my Nikon N80. The overall performance of the E-10 has exceeded all of my expectations. I've had the camera for 2 months and have already taken over 600 pictures. I love this camera. If you want the most bang for the buck in a digital camera and plan on taking a lot of pictures, then this is the camera to buy. I suggest that you keep a UV filter on the lense at all times. The only other filer that you might want is a circular polarizing filter. The camera will try to color balance pictures taken with any enhancing filters so save your money. The White Balance feature on the E-10 is great. I've had some pictures where the colors seem a little flat particulary on cloudy overcast days. By changeing the WB setting, I've been able to correct this condition most of the time. It just takes practice.I use both CF and SmartMedia in this camera and have no problems at all. Having had previous expirence with IBM microdrives, I wouldn't recommend that they be used. First of all they are delicate and don't like to be bounced around, Secondly they are power hungry. I wouldn't expect battery life to be too good using a microdrive. Besides Olympus doesn't support the microdrive on the E-10. It is supported on the new E-20.The only warning that I have for prospective internet buyers is if the price seems to be too good, it might be. Some sources are selling a European version of this camera that is not covered by the Olympus warrenty in the US.

I have the Nikon D1, but this camera is the first out of my bag.  It gives so much.One thing to consider is that this outstanding camera is currently in a class by itself.  There just isn't another one like it.Let me just comment on the \"noise\".  There is some.  This is also a bone that many have been chewing on ever since the E-10 came out.  But, I read everything I can about this product.  I participate on professional message boards.  I have access to many pro-grade digital cameras, and I know a lot of people who use the E-10.  The consensus - the noise is not a problem.The 640th of a second top shutter speed is odd; I'll give you that.  But I have had little reason to exceed this speed - even to my own surprise.  The first argument is that you'll tend to over-expose in bright sunlight.  Well, get a neutral density filter for 30 bucks - problem solved.  The second, I can't use it in sports shoots.  My answer to that is, well you shouldn't have purchased this camera for sports in the first place - Oly's E-100 is better suited for that. It takes 15 frame bursts, and has a whopper of a zoom on it, plus a progressive scan CCD that rings in at 1.5-megapixels. The E-10 uses the interlaced CCD at 4.1-megapixels.  It's just a whole different animal.  And, honestly, I've shot sporting events with mine, and there are no problems to report.  You just have to make certain allowances.All in all, you buy this camera, You Won't Regret It!Five Big Fat Stars!", "Date": "March 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "My Experiences with the Olympus Camedia E-10", "Author": "\"fruitfulpenpal\"", "ReviewID": "R7S3VVGGWN3UD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm sorry faithful fans of the Camedia E-10, but I must ruin the 5-star reputation of this particular digital camera. I hate to be such a party pooper, so I'll start with the good stuff, and thus, tell you all the good things that earned the 4 stars from me. First, on a superficial level, the physical design of the camera is magnificent. This camera is faithful to most SLR designs, and in my opinion, is currently the most stylish look out of all the cameras out there--including the Nikon D1. I particularly like the aluminum exterior. When it's a cold morning and your mind is completely rested, pulling that camera out of its leather case is where I receive a lot of my motivation in the morning--I don't drink coffee. To feel that cold, heavy weight in my hands makes me feel that I have a high quality, well-made camera.  Second, the features are excellent, in that most of the major functions can be adjusted manually, opposed to looking through the LCD screen to set a specific function, as in most other digital cameras, like the Nikon Coolpix series, for example. My favorite feature is the manual zoom. Regular digital cameras like the Sony Cybershot F505V with automatic zoom are too sensitive. Hence, with a manual zoom, not only does it have that SLR feel, it gives the photographer much more control. Third, the E-10 has 4.1 megapixels, but honestly, there are only 3.7 that are actually used. But still, at least the images aren't interpolated. And I still love the detail in each image.  Fourth, of course, the SLR feature is always a plus as far as accuracy goes in taking pictures. Always using the LCD screen to take pictures on my other non-SLR digital cameras always dissatisfies me for many obvious reasons.  Fifth, the 4X zoom is pretty hot, in use with the awesome 3X telephoto lens that you can get on this sit...  Using the telephoto lens, this will give you 12X, and that's great compared to the other less-expensive cameras. Slightly going off tangent, I must also say that Olympus has a good selection of accessories, although they're really hard to find all in one place and are usually on back order. The macro lens particularly impresses me.  Sixth, the price is excellent.  I would buy it, simply because this camera breaches into the professional category, opposed to the simpler point-and-shoot digital cameras. However, the Nikon Coolpix 990 is a good compromise, going beyond the simple point-and-shoot limitation. And lastly, I can't forget the lens. This is my favorite feature. This camera takes superb night pictures--the best I've ever seen. And in my opinion, from the reviews I've read on certain other digital cameras I haven't personally tried yet, I think that the night pictures on this camera are the best on the market. I took a picture in an extremely low-light situation. We're talking about midnight on a barely litted residential neighborhood. The camera produced pictures that looked as though it were dawn.  Now for the bad stuff about this camera: First, there is some noise on the pictures--enough to get most people slightly annoyed. The worst pictures were ones taken inside my house under adequate incandescent lighting, without a flash. The pictures looked as though there were electronic bacteria on the painting on the wall. In other cases, such as outdoor pictures with good lighting, the noise lessens, but is still apparent, even at low ISO. But still, for adequate lighting, I think the camera should still perform well. But still, one must ask, what happens if someone wants to take pictures inside a dim museum? Indeed, this is the most flawed feature, in my opinion.  Second, the color of the images has a good and bad side. The colors are too neutral, which makes the picture look bland. However, this is a good feature for the photographer that wants consistent-looking, real pictures. But in my opinion, the pictures look too real, almost mundane. There will be no good and bad surprises, when viewing these pictures, in my opinion. Third, the built-in lens also has its ups and downs. The good part is that you don't have to worry about dust and other blemishes getting on your lens. And trust me, that happens easily. The bad part is that, if you have a load of lenses that are dying to cross the film-bound SLR to the digital SLR camera, you're going to be disappointed and curse 'til your front tooth flies loose. This is absolutely a necessity to know for the more experienced photographer.  And lastly, the fastest shutter speed is contemptible; it is 1/640th of a second. This can be somewhat fixed with a 62mm neutral-density filter, however. Without it, on a really bright day, the pictures come out overexposed--I don't know what Olympus was thinking here. And of course, taking motion pictures is another small problem worth noting.  That's all folks! And remember, positive features are great to know, because we all want quality, but the negative features are what we NEED to know--they bring us back to reality and have us regret most of the junk we buy.

I am a novice photographer and started out with the Olympus 3000.  I love the E-10 as it takes great photos in spite of lack of experience but it does seem to have some drawbacks.  For one, the auto focus does seem to have trouble especially in any type of low light.  I mostly use the manual focus.  In group shots you may find some focus problems.  I would recommend nothing smaller than a 128mb memory card even though I used a 256.  At the resolution the camera is capable of I take only SHQ or Tiff shots.  Lithium batteries actually work quite a while in this camera.  The manual that comes with the camera is quite easy to use and understand.  While the camera does come with lots of bells and whistles, it's not too difficult to understand most of them in a short period of time.  I did find it was very easy to take blurry shots with just the slightest movement of the camera during the shot.  Use a tripod when its reasonable to use one.  If not, HOLD STILL.  Use the LCD display only if necessary as it sucks the life out of the batteries.  Almost impossible to use it during bright sunlight.  Also its too close to the rear eye piece so always expect smudges on it from your face.The camera is quite heavy but it is constructed very very well.  The lense is non-removeable and this has been somewhat of a critcism but I find the lense on this camera is great.  I do recommend the U.V. filter and leave it on all the time.  A replaced filter is a heck of a lot cheaper than a replaced lense.  As far as service from Olympus.  I actually damaged my E-10 (dropped the darn thing) and sent if off to Olympus.  (Keep the original box).  It was fixed, no charge, and returned to me in 7 days and it works perfectly.  That I was impressed with.In conclusion.  Is this a professional camera as touted by others? Naw, not really.  But for the money it's a close as you are going to get.  Most of the other professional digital cameras are 5k to 30k.  With this camera and some practice, you can take pitures that rival a pro.  Of course, a good photo printer is necessary.  I am an idiot when it comes to photography and the camera takes great shots in spite of me.

I started with a Kodak D460, moved thru three Olympus Camera's including the D400, C2000, and C2500, then the Nikon's: the 950 and the 990.  I must say that I really enjoyed the C2000 and the the Nikon's the most.  I continue to think of the 990 as a superb digicam whose macro ability is without peer.  Having said that, I thoroughly enjoy the E-10!  From the moment I picked it up, I think I was hooked.  Ergonomically, the camera is beyond approach.  All the important functions are at your fingertips (literally) and none are buried in menus.  Second, the image qualtiy, color and resolution are amazing.  Every bit as good and in some cases even better than the 990, although it cannot get as close ( even with the add-on macro lens)It is also very quick, shot to shot, manual focus, Compact flash and Smart Media, I could go on an on.  For me, it represents the next step from a point and shoot.  It gives me the ability to take pictures and feel like I have all the control in the world.  It is a superb instrument.  It is, like others have pointed out, not without shortcomings.  The picture review is way too slow when compared to any other digicam I've owned.  Is this a showstopper-absolutely not.  They say fixed lens is a problem.  For me, I knew it was fixed when I bought it.  I knew what it was capable of alone and with the attachments.  Max shutter speed too, has been cited as problematic at only 1/640.  Guess what?  After 6,000 pics, I haven't had one missed shot because of slow shutter speed.  Besides, I don't take pictures of car racing.

Superlatives don't exist for how pleased I was when I tried the E10.

Reluctantly on the last day, I decided to spend the morning trying it out.

The ability to manually set color temperature is like having a studio, a refrigerator full of film, and several light meters all with you at DisneyWorld!!!! Bottome line, if you are SERIOUS about photography, or earn part or all of your living via photography, this is a bargain. You will not regret it.

After holding all three in my hands and shooting with them, there is no comparison -- the E-10 is a camera and feels and works like an SLR body, the Minolta and the Sony are just consumer electronics.E-10 photos in adequate light or with a decent flash system are excellent; resolution is great, noise is present but when exposure is good it is very gaussian and thus mimics good film grain perfectly. Though the E-10's sensor is \"only\" 4 megapixels, the lens is bright and perfectly matched to the frame; when you're looking at the 8x10 prints, it's very hard to tell the difference between the E-10 and the 5 megapixel cameras on the market. Color reproduction is very true, which means again much more film-like, but possibly flat for people accustomed to consumer digicams (which tend to try to make everything look \"better than real life\" rather than \"like real life\"). If you want to oversaturate, you can always do it afterward in Photoshop, GIMP, etc.Some user reviews have complaied about the E-10 autofocus, but there's nothing wrong with it. The E-10 has an SLR-style AF system; this is not a \"focus-free\" camera. You must pay attention at least to the AF target area and focus lock, and if you're not shooting in 'P' mode also to the depth of field and shutter speed. Many users who complain about getting out of focus shots with the E-10 are coming from low-end \"focus-free\" point and shoot film or digital cameras and don't know how to properly use the AF system on a camera like this one, nor how to adjust for the other variables.Positives: camera looks like a USB hard drive to the computer, no additional software or hardware needed to transfer images; adjustable quality settings -- SHQ, HQ, and SQ can each be user-defined to any number of resolution and compression settings; both CompactFlash AND SmartMedia slots and you can use both at once; excellent build quality -- my E-10 could survive a war; manual focus and zoom rings for rapid, accurate control; raw mode for highest quality shooting; histogram for checking exposure; all controls are locking controls and are on the camera body -- you won't have to be navigating menus all day while you shoot; settings panel on top is lit (nice touch!) for shooting in darkness; long tripod exposures in low light are stunning, noise-free, and very sharp; bright TTL viewfinder, not an electronic viewfinder like you'll find on some \"SLR-like\" digital cameras; easy-to-access rapid white balance measurement system; zero shutter lag -- you can get four shots off in one second; lit status display below the glass in the viewfinder just as you'd expect with any SLR so you can shoot, change settings, shoot, change settings again, without ever moving your eye from the shot.Negatives: noise becomes a problem in \"pushed\" (underexposed, then gamma-corrected) shots -- no \"ISO-boost\" trickery with the E-10; body and lens are heavy enough to cause strap-burn after a few hours; inability to reliably use microdrives; must be sent back to Olympus for firmware upgrades; maximum shutter of 1/640s can be a limitation in sunlight or when shooting action; only four shots in continuous mode before having to wait for buffer flush; focus screen can be difficult to see accurately; no depth of field preview; RAW images are not optimized/compressed and are thus 7MB(!) each, TIFF are 12MB(!!).This is a great camera for the enthusiast or the professional needing a backup or studio camera. On the other hand the E-10 is probably too much work (settings, weight, additional storage requirements of 4 megapixels, more complex AF) if you just want occasional shapshots or a thought-free, unobtrusive vacation camera.

It gives the camera extra heft, and provides an extra shutter release button.Some have complained about the low top shutter speed of 1/640 of a second. Many of the staff photographers at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway use the E-10, and have no problem shooting race cars at 1/640. You have to pan in these situations. Several of the IMS photographers have told me they much prefer the E-10 over the Canon EOS D-30 for high-speed subjects, and the D-30 costs a thousand dollar more, and doesn't come with lenses.An impressive E-10 feature is the camera's ablity to take sharp photos in low-light situations. I have taken numerous clear, focused photos at 1/8, handheld. Autofocus is a unreliable in the dark, but if you crank the diopter on the eyepiece all the way clockwise manual focus is not a problem.

I've learned more about photography with this camera than with the dozen or so film cameras I've owned before. Believe it or not, this camera will make you a good photographer. The pros will surely laugh at this statement, but if you are a beginner, you will be simply amazed at the quality of the pictures you'll get out of this thing. Coupled with the P-400 dye-sub printer, you'll blow people's minds with the quality output.I do have to second some of the negatives mentioned by other reviewers. Auto-focus in dim-light is nearly impossible and quite frustrating. Consider adding the FL-40 flash (with additional rangefinder) to correct this problem.  I couldn't agree more with the guy who said the Olympus semi-hard case wasn't good. Another thing I don't think anyone mentioned was the close proximity of the eyepiece to the camera. It would have been nice if they'd extended that piece farther back or inset the LCD display. You'll often find yourself  wiping nose prints off your LCD.One review mentioned the poor support for the MicroDrive. Olympus states that the E-10 is not compatible with the MicroDrive. While you can get it to work, it's just not worth the hassle and it will quickly drain the batteries. I bought a couple of 256K CompactFlash cards and each one gives me 96 pictures at the highest JPEG setting.Olympus seems like a good company so far, but I was quite unimpressed with how they market this camera on their own website. You won't find it easy to find options for this camera at their E-10 page. The info on the camera itself is pretty sketchy as well. I spent a lot of time comparing makes and models and found this camera to be at the top of its class. After owning and using it for a few months now,  I know I made the right choice. Overall, this is a great camera and while it has a few shortfalls, they pale in comparison to the features and quality of this unit.

There are those who say the camera is heavy..That's a plus , not a minus when you're trying to keep it still. There are those who say that the focus is out. Olympus will gladly fix it if it is in fact out, but before you say it's out learn how to focus. Even in autofocus mode you should learn the tricks. Overall the quality of the camera is nothing short of excellent. Dual Storage media is a BIG plus. Picture quality is among the best digitals out today. The Built-in Flash is probably the best of all digitals. Lens construction and quality is above average. The F2.0 is a real pleasure. Just think, where can you get a 400mm F2.0 lens by adding an attachment. Olympus E10 that's where...The controls are all outside so there's no messing around with the menu. They are all at your finger tips. This is one of the best ergonomic designs that I have seen in a camera. The viewfinder displays all the important info about the shot. There are controls for bracketing, compensation, AE lock, macro mode, Spot, Center weighted and EPS Multi pattern meetering etc..What else...Well there was some small talk about noise and dead pixels...I never experienced either the noise or the dead pixels (Just lucky I guess)but maybe some of the talk was a lot of bull....In any case, if you're moving from a film to a digital, this is the one.

The camera takes excellent pictures, and the manual controls are very easy to use and allow very professional looking results.  Prints from the camera to a P400 Olympus printer look excellent up to 8.5X11 inches (I am sure they would look better on a bigger print, but that is as big as my printer can do).  My only complaint in the LCD screen.  It refreshes slowly, and takes quite a long time to preview images.  Also, when zooming in and out on the pictures really takes longer then necessary (from both CF and SM).  Just as one final note, although the camera literature does not specify support for the new 512MB CF cards, I use one with no problems.

The E-10 is my camera of choice, although I could afford to step up to full pro.  The lenses are excellent, and don't let the fact that you can't interchange them bother you.  It protects the CCD, which bites dust and can't be cleaned except by a tech.  Unfortunately, Olympus has among the worst customer service attitudes I've ever encountered.  They make no secret out of the fact that they don't want to talk to you.  They leave you on hold listening to a recording that encourages you to use their website instead.  They even charge you extra if you choose to order by phone.  Trouble is, they don't answer their email, so if you have a question before you buy, forget it.  They also talk to you like you're a dog, transfer your call in the middle of your sentence, and just generally act like you have a lot of nerve to interrupt their day.The hot shoe cover on my E-10 was loose when the camera arrived, and eventually it came off and was lost.  I contacted them about obtaining another, and they gave me totally useless advice about where to get one, and acted like they'd rather be eating road kill than talking to me.Will I buy the E-20?

Schaffner", "ReviewID": "R282CZAIXV1MG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an amateur who has been taking nature and action photographs with Nikon SLRs for many years. The light is often crummy and my subjects move about. I used an Olympus C-3000 for two years and immediately fell in love with the flat response of the CCD compared to film.  However, that squinchy little rangefinder, and that long pause before the image is actually recorded..  I really found I needed a large bright through-the-lens viewfinder.  However, I was surprised to find that even 3 megapixels was just fine for really sharp 8x10 images unless you had to crop aggressively.For me, the E-10 was just what I needed. 4 megapixels is fine for just about anything I would want to do.  If you really think you need 5, spend $500 more on the E-20. Remember, however, that more pixels means more time to record, play back, or modify each image.  The viewfinder is large and bright and the diopter correction is very positive. Eye relief is good enough to use glasses. Unlike an SLR, the viewfinder light comes from a beam splitter rather than a flip-up mirror. This raises the question of what the lens speed of F2 means, since the beam-splitter will steal some light. There is a built-in viewfinder cover so you won't get stray light coming in when you take remote shots.  The lens is really nice and seemed to have very low flare. The built-in macro focusing feature gets you close enough for anything but documenting periodontal surgery.Understand, though, that this camera is big and heavy compared to most modern digital cameras. Nobody who grew up on SLRs will be surprised, but remember that you are going to have to lug this puppy around for several years. Despite its size and weight, it feels very comfortable, even for a lefty.The E-10 has most of the controls a good SLR would have and several more that are completely beyond a chemical camera. The combination of exposure correction, sharpness and contrast control, and image histogram display really help in those bad light situations.So, a pro might want more pixels and many amateurs will want something smaller and lighter.

But after looking for a couple of months I bought the E-10 because of its form factor and the relatively high resolution of the images.

The extra lenses, especially telephoto and macro let you capture photos of just about everything you can do with an SLR.  The features are more or less accessible by the physical controls all over the camera.  Some of them are novel, but once you experience them (opening the flash, turning on the menu) they are pretty easy to use.  I thought the two form factors for image storage well silly at first, but it allows you to load your photos into almost all other devices (printers).

The battery door is located on the bottom, so batteries can be swapped out even when the camera is mounted on a tripod.The lense is not interchangable, which can be a disadvantage for some, but it ensures that no dust can get into the shutter or behind the lense. I love the dial controls. There are enough dials and buttons on the camera so that the LCD display is not required for most camera settings.There are a few disadvantages to the camera. The shutter speed only goes up to 1/640, and the aperature only goes up to F11, however the aperature can be as shallow as F2.2. Also, as time has worn on, the light meter doesn't seem to perform as well in low light as when I first bought this camera. Don't get me wrong, though. It still does an excellent job.

The beam splitter view finder is sweet and the manual zoom allows for working the 4x zoom quickly. I bought the matching F-40 flash unit which integrates with the camera to expose flash pictures very well. The flash also follows the zoom lens shifting from wide-angle to telephoto as the lens is worked.
