It has all the basic features you would need for great pictures and it is fairly easy to use. I was able to play with it for less than 5 minutes and have all the controls figured out without looking at a manual. The battery life seems great as I just got back from a week long vacation and after snapping over 150 photos I still have almost a full battery. I am also very impressed with how great my pictures turned out, vivid colors and great contrast.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price", "Author": "D. Thierry", "ReviewID": "R2J8LWG0WCIGOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this product as I planned a last-minute visit to the Niagara Falls and, being on a business trip, I had nothing else to immortalize this moment than my smartphone and its lousy camera. After unpacking it, I first tried it indoors and was not impressed at all: mediocre yellowish pictures, noisy and grainy. I tried to disable the (weak) flash and it got worse. I was tempted to return it immediately but decided to give it a try outdoors. When I started to shoot the falls, I became very quickly addicted to this litte gizmo. In most of the cases, the camera is able to deal with the subject, although I would recommend the usage of the advanced scene mode: facing violent contrasts, the camera shoots automatically twice with different exposure parameters, which increases the odds to get a good shot. Smart.The exposure can be easily fixed manually, using the \"manual\" mode (in fact, an automatic mode that can be adjusted). In a matter of seconds, over-exposed white water on dark rocks takes texture, to the droplet. It is a bit of trial and error, but delivers quick results. The panorama function works very well, delivery much better pictures than the lousy prints available in the souvenir shop. I also gave it a chance to show how it works with video: better than average sound (if not too much wind), functional and silent zoom and again, surprising image quality. As the light changed due to overcast clouds, I adjusted the settings and the camera obediently followed, again delivering satisfying stills. The zoom works fine. It's not a super-zoom but the resolution is good enough to enable enlargement on the PC.Happy with the outdoor quality, I decided to give it another try indoors, using the advanced mode P. To my surprise, the various settings, including several white balance modes, enabled to fix the initial issues and I got noise-free, decent-quality pictures under artificial lighting. I fumbled a bit with the flash and while I find it a bit rough, it's within expectations.Outdoor picture quality is really great for the price - I was really positively surprised by the sharpness and color quality, which is still far from SLR standards but surprising for a compact. The autofocus is decent, shutter speed good, transfer speed correct. The camera behaves predictably. It is more limited indoors but still very decent once one gets used to it. I was not disturbed by the lack of functionality to adjust speed or aperture as I'm using it for point-and-shoot, which it does pretty well in general. It's not a function-rich camera, but what's built in is useful and working well (the online manual may need some polishing though).I'm giving it five stars because this Sony camera exceeds consistently my value-for-money expectations. It cannot be a substitute for more serious hardware (I own a Sony Alpha and my wife is a NEX user) but it is definitively the camera I will take on business trips or in my breast pocket for a casual walk in the park.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "awesome!", "Author": "D.

Hutchings", "ReviewID": "R2DP5Q204BEKZO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Even at this price, this camera is very disappointing. It is literally too automatic and makes terrible picture decisions.  There is no substantial means for user intervention to create better quality photos. When shooting indoors w/o flash, the ISO jumps to 800 and the pix are terrible. The camera lives at f:2.6, so any depth of field is next to impossible to achieve.And, why would anyone be interested in shooting video with a still camera that cannot deliver a quality still photograph is beyond me.  Video cameras shoot video, still cameras shoot still images. Who needs it?? And panorama?? Let's worry about decent stills first.This little camera has a Zeiss designed lens... You wouldn't know it looking at the pictures...  Infinity focus is just not there... At 16mp, 13x19\" prints are noisy and mushy at all ISO settings. At 10mp and ISO 80-100, results are a little better - tolerable maybe. 8/5x11\" - letter size prints were fair at best at all ISO settings... JPEG picture quality is very soft and grainy looking at all resolution settings.... 5X7\" seems the largest acceptable prints size.I am a Leica owner (film) 2 bodies and half-dozen lenses.  I realize that a \"simple\"camera wont't deliver Leica quality, but when my wife complains about fuzzy images, there may be a problem.  She is not as discriminating about photo quality as I am; it's not what she does.When she questioned the results with this camera, I took it and compared it print for print with my Sony Alpha 100 (10mp DSLR) using to prime and a Tamron wide-angle zoom lenses to match various focal lengths.  I know the alpha sensor is bigger, but 16mp against 10mp ought to be somewhat close in quality.  It wasn't.  At almost double the resolution it clearly did not come close.Think she might like to try a Canon Powershot S100, G12, or G1X. All of these are more expensive, but the quality is the issue here. She is now using a Sony DSC-F828.  The only problem is physical size. It is only an 8mp camera and has a Zeiss zoom lens that opens to f:2.0 - f2.8 across its entire zoom range.  It is 9 years old and I have produced 13x19\" gallery prints with it with no need for photo-shop enhancement.  If Sony still made this camera with a 10 or 12mp sensor, It would still be my camera of choice.Since this is an edited re-posting, I have to add that Amazon refunded my purchase in less that 5 business days... No problem.  Have also purchased an Alpha 290 from Amazon.. If it proves a problem, the Canons are next or perhaps the Panasonic Lumix LX5.FRED HUTCHINGS", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this line of cameras", "Author": "Consumer816", "ReviewID": "R290O4DJK80V38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very easy to use, takes amazing pictures for the price and size.

We both wanted something that we can always take with us.  This camera fits in a men's dress shirt pocket and is completely concealed.  We have used these cameras for the past six months and they have produced amazing pictures.  We are both extremely happy with these little photographic wonders.I own three cameras ... this one...an Olympus XZ-1 ... and a Nikon D7000 DSLR, and I use all three ...mostly the DSLR whenever I can.This camera gets 5 stars for the following reasons and considering  that it is a pocket camera (not a DSLR ;-) - digital single lens reflex camera):1)  The size of the camera is only 3.8 inches x 2.2 inches with a 3\" back review LCD screen (230k dots resolution, awesome for this little wonder) and less than an inch thin (0.8\") with control elements that even a grown man can reasonably operate.  So very compact but well designed elements.2)  The camera has 16.1 MP and has outstanding Carl Zeiss optics (5x optical zoom).Carl Zeiss optics are flawless in quality, and without the optics nothing else matters.  That this camera has such a high quality lens is a great sign of what's behind the lens.  The lens is image stabilized.Lens Type : Carl Zeiss\u00ae Vario-Tessar\u00aeOptical Zoom : 5xFocal Length (35mm equivalent) : Still 16:9: 28-140mm / Still 4:3: 25-125mm / Movie 16:9: 29-145mm(SteadyShot Standard), 30-150mm(SteadyShot Active) / Movie 4:3: 35-175mm(SteadyShot Standard), f=37-185mm(SteadyShot Active)Lens Construction : 6 elements in 5 groups (including 3 aspheric elements)Minimum Focus Distance : iAuto:AF(W:Approx..5cm(0.16') to Infinity, T:Approx.100cm(3.28') to Infinity) / Program Auto:AF(W:Approx..5cm(0.16') to Infinity, T:Approx.100cm(3.28') to Infinity)Aspheric Elements : 3Steady Shot Mode:Active : YesRegarding the 16.1 MP image sensor.  I shoot this sony with 10MP resolution because I don't like to deal with huge files and it makes little difference to my perceived quality of this image from this camera.  However the results from this camera are truly outstanding.  You can produce a good looking 20\" X 30\" poster from this 10MP image, so with 16.1 MP full resolution you will get all you ever need for casual photography ( for what this camera is really meant for).  The resolution is adjustable with the easy to use menu screen:  16.1 MP, 10MP, 5MP (straight uploadable resolution to Facebook), VGA resolution (640x480 pixels for direct computer screen for a blog for example) all in 4:3 aspect ratio.  You can also choose wide screen shooting modes (aspect ratio 16:9) in these resolutions:  12 MP and 2 MP.So really plenty of options to adjust to your needs/preferences.3)  The camera can be operated in different camera modes including P (for most manual control):Intelligent Auto (works great), Program Auto (most control for the user), Picture Effect (for the instant artist ;-), 4 modes ), and scene mode (11 scene modes wow).a)  Intelligent Auto:  This is my main mode to use this camera for plain fun snap shots without having to think.  This camera is great in focusing, choosing modes and getting the best picture for you most of the time and instantly.  In iAuto you get to further select EASY mode (simplified menu and larger font for the true point and shooter who just rather not deal with anything except take a great picture), image resolution, single shooting or continous shooting (1 fps up to 100 shots), EV (exposure correction -2.0 to +2.0) basically to adjust image brightness, iScene auto and advanced,smile detection sensitivity (three settings),Face detection (off,auto,child priority,adult priority,in camera guide,operation settings menu (time,date,sounds).b) Program Auto: this gives you more choices for those more familiar with photography.  It is actually quite amazing to me how many cool features have been carried from advanced photography into this one-click-wonder.  same controls as in a) above but in addition these... ISO settings: Auto, 80,100,200,400,800,1600,3200;  White Balance: Auto,Daylight,Cloudy,Fluorescent 1,2,3, Incandescent,Flash,One Push and One Push Set (for custom white balance, cool!); Auto Focus: Multi AF,Center AF,Spot AF; Metering Mode: Multi,Center,Spot; DRO (recovering of tones in image): Off,standard,plus;c) Picture effect:  I haven't used these...you can do it with photoshop etc, but why bother with complex software as a poin and shooter with these fun features?! ...and instant gratification with Toy Camera: shoot images with the effect of a toy camera ... i guess it sounds like a toy camera (the shutter release haha) ... Pop effect:  shoot images in pop and colorful colors ... Partial color: shoots dramatic images coloring only the extracted colors (extract red, green, blue, yellow)...like a red rose in a black and white pic ...sweet...Soft High key Effect:  shootswarm fresh photos emphasizing the bright areas.4)  It takes amazing video (i didn't buy it for video, but it does do a great job)  but hey I take it and it is a bonus to me.Video Format : MP4(AVC/H.264)Video Mode : 1280x720(Fine)(1,280x720/30fps)/1280x720(Standard)(1,280x720/30fps)/VGA(640x480/30fps)Audio Format : AACMicrophone/Speaker : Mono/monoThat sums up my reasons why I consider this a great 5 star camera and a fantastic buy for ANYONE.This is a complete one-click-wonder and may become even a serious photographers little angel in the pocket (it is for me for sure) ... because the best camera is the one you have with you ... and if it has to fit in a pocket, this definitely the best!", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony Cyber-Shot DSCW650", "Author": "Naiomie", "ReviewID": "R2OBEI2XODX7PA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love Sony Cyber-shot Cameras.

Komala \"avid shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R29BW48GKK4W97", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned many cameras from many makes and models. Currently I have two Canon DSLRs and half a dozen mirrorless compact system cameras from Sony, Samsung, Panasonic, Nikon and Pentax.In short, I know quite a bit about digital cameras, not just the technical details but also the built-quality, the aesthetic and the handling / user interface for example.I purchased this Sony W650 as a gift for my mom.Before deciding to buy it, I was torn between it and Canon Elph 100 HS. I loved the Canon P&S; cameras I owned in the past but I also loved Sony ones I had as well.Between these two, Sony W650 is newer and cheaper. It also has sweep panorama. The camera looks pretty in the pictures.However, once I have it on my hand, I can tell immediately that while the front has a nice look of brushed metal finish, the back looks like it's made of cheap plastic. If I hold the back of the camera against a light source, I can see uneven surface as if a result of a bad paint job. I got the red color one by the way.The buttons look and feel cheap as well. The zoom is not smooth / even but rather jumpy. Going through the menu, I can tell that this is not a camera I would love to use. The camera features are very basic. Eg. for the flash, you can only choose either Auto or Off (at least on the intelligent Auto mode).It is a far cry from all other point and shoot cameras I have used in the past including Sony W50/W55.I went to a local brick and mortar store to get a better comparison between many different point and shoot cameras. For a point and shoot camera, the price only makes sense as long as it is below $200. Because above that, you enter into a realm of mirrorless compact system camera which most have significatly larger sensor than typical point and shoot cameras. So I limit my price range to below $200.I went back to the other camera I was originally interested on. At the brick and mortar store, they only have the Elph 110 HS which is the newer model but for the most part identical to the 100 HS.Canon 100 HS has \"only\" 12 megapixels while Sony W650 has 16 megapixels.However, most point and shoot cameras such as these have tiny imaging sensor, 1/2.3\" (6.17mm x 4.55mm) to be exact. Higher megapixels generally means higher noise.Canon 100 HS has a more beautiful finish throughout its surface. No bad paint job LOL.Buttons are flushed, which may irk some people, but I found that they are fine. They are larger than those on the Sony and don't look like they may come off or break off easily like the Sony's.Menus look better. It has more features than the Sony's.In the end, I returned the Sony W650 and bought the Canon Elph 100HS.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money", "Author": "Northern star", "ReviewID": "R61NEB4TB0LXL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because of the price and all these seemingly great specifications, this camera is really not worth the money- it is very light and has a cheap feel to match the price- resolution on the viewfinder remainds me of my old Nokia phone from 5 years ago- takes at least 10 seconds to retrieve a photo and no instant viewing- the so-called Carl Zeiss lens is not the real thing as the brand name was licensed to Sony and lenses made elsewhere- cannot charge the camera directly as the battery needs to be taken out and charged separately each time- most importantly the picture quality is absolute crap.

I was previously using a Kodak EasyShare C143. The Kodak took sharper pictures and had more fine detail almost every shot. The C143 is a 12MP camera that takes pics at 4000 x 3000 at 480dpi.  This Sony camera DSC-W650, is 16.1MP and takes pics at 4608 x 3456 at 350dpi.I also compared it to my older 8MP Kodak ZD8612 IS....(3264 X 2448 at 480dpi) and those pics are still a bit sharper and clearer than this new Sony camera.The C143's auto focus was faster and noticeably more accurate than the Sony's...almost all of my pics are clear and detailed..on the Sony, lucky to have half of them turn out.I mostly take pics indoors, and the Sony's flash isn't that great. Low light performance is poor. Pictures loose significant detail at higher iso's.The HD video recording on this camera is great, definitely much better than the 2 other cams, but they aren't HD..so no real contest there.One thing I really like about this camera though, is it has a \"Easy Mode\"...where is makes the text big and camera VERY simple to use...dumbed down menus, locks out everything except pure basic functions... for those people like my folks can use...just point and press button. My 70yr old Grandma would really like that...Assuming she could remember how to turn the camera on...lol.I also noticed the LCD screen display is quite fuzzy and distorted, no where near as sharp as my old Kodak...even the text on the screen is phased out and blurry...hard to read..the screen seems to flicker or...just look out of sync...or something...hard on the eyes...and if you look at the screen from any other angle other than straight at it....eye level..it is super blurry, very bad viewing angles.I contacted Sony support...spent over an hour on the phone going through their stupid \"idiots\" method of troubleshooting, resting camera, pulling battery in and out, etc...I HATE THAT!!!... finally, the guy in India told me they will accept the cam in for repair this one time...even though I could not produce a receipt. Annoying to have to pay to ship defective things back to companies...they should cover shipping both ways, since it was their fault their quality control missed it....but...yea...what company ever does that nowadays..will update once i get cam back in..o..whenever they decide to...UPDATE: Just picked up this: Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS19 Digital Camera- Black  Like it much better. See my review their.UPDATE 12/27/12: Sent in cam for repair. Had to pay to ship it to them. Got call from Sony a week alter \"technician found nothing wrong\". I re-explained the issue with the lcd screen...the guy (who could barely speak English) took about 10 min of explaining to realize a hardware issue..then he quickly told me \"I update and we work on it\"...2 hrs later I get an automated email from Sony stating the camera is being shipped back to me.Received it today...and can't tell any difference. The included paperwork has marks on it indicating the lcd panel was replaced and the camera cleaned and lubricated, but the screen still looks horrible fuzzy and the menus still have a a flicker effect to them. The screen has poor viewing angles. No where near as sharp and clear as the Panasonic ZS19 camera I bought to replace this one. Despite the poor quality lcd, this Sony seems to take decent pictures, they look fine on the computer. Just annoying, as you may not be sure the picture you take is in focus or blurry or not, as the pictures always look blurry on the built in screen.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "Rodrigo Gama", "ReviewID": "RP8HGGXWKNUW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I need this product and it is very good choose, I like so much my choose and  I recommend from my friends", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Rajiba Lochan Panda", "ReviewID": "R2RPN8EW4NUB7J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony cyber-shot a good digicam.

It's so bad I almost wonder if mine is defective.  I shot a bunch of pictures on a trip in \"Program Auto\" mode (differs from \"Intelligent Auto\" mainly in that you can set the ISO).  Where to start?Calling it 16.1 megapixels is a joke.  At full resolution, the images are so grainy and posterized that they are unusable for any purpose.  You can get OK images for sharing on the web by resampling them down to about 300,000 pixels (i.e. reduce 98%) and then sharpen in Photoshop.  But it would be easier to just buy a 1-megapixel camera and avoid the extra work.  The camera has low-resolution settings, and I will try those in the future.  Perhaps part of the problem is excessive or sloppy jpeg compression, but the camera seems to have no setting that would allow you to capture raw images even if you wanted to.The camera says it has 5x optical zoom, but fully zoomed, the pictures looked like taken through a fog that wasn't there.The camera has ISO settings up to 3200, but at 800 the quality is already so bad you might as well not bother (unless it's something urgent to photograph and you don't care about quality.)  At 400 the images are already notably degraded.The exposure metering is inconsistent.  If you start pointing at the sky, and then move down to your subject, you will get a very different image from when you start pointing at something dark and move to the subject.  The auto-focus (the only focus you get on this type of camera) is not very reliable, and quite a few images are poorly focused.  The auto-focus gets especially confused by shiny, metal objects like bronze statues.Contrast control is terrible.  Nearly every image has white burned in patches.  Sky on a cloudy day nearly always goes pure white.  I have used half a dozen digital cameras (OK, all more expensive), and this one is hands down the worst for chronic overburn.In program auto mode, the camera has a strange bias toward fast shutter and low depth of field (such as 1/320 at 3.5), so lots of images have needlessly blurred patches in the foreground or background (and you can't control that.)Perhaps I am being unreasonable, and a $100 camera is the digital equivalent of the paper box throw-away film camera, and it's not fair to expect anything in the way of image quality.  But sheesh.  The camera is so disappointing that I am tempted to put Sony down with HP on my don't buy anything ever list.
