It worked great for categorizing my scrapbook while on vacation in Spain. The year before I took hundreds of pictures and when I returned I couldn't remember where they were all taken so I would take a picture and write on the back.I have to admit the quality of the pictures has a lot to be desired( they really,really need to work on this) that's why I only gave it 4 stars.I recently used it at Easter get together and the families loved it! Everyone had there Sunday best on and could see how they looked. This is where this camera will come in handiest, at gatherings!", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mimi", "Author": "kay vaughan", "ReviewID": "R1EQCB13WS1NI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The instant printing is great, and the grandchildren love to have the picture in a flash, works great and a lot of fun.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "Polaroid Z340 Instant Digital Camera with ZINK (Zero Ink) Printing Technology", "Name": "Polaroid Z340 Instant Digital Camera with ZINK (Zero Ink) Printing Technology - Bundle - with Polaroid Spare Battery, Polaroid 3x4\" Zink Photo Paper 90 Sheets", "ImgURL": "http://218.201.42.40:8080/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31oviVd1KjL.jpg", "ProductID": "B007X92BEE"}}
