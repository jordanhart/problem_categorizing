{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I'm really impressed with the new HS-10.", "Author": "Adrian", "ReviewID": "R3RLVQJR4YVNC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for this camera ever since I found out about it a month ago and flew down to the camera shop as soon as they told me it had arrived. I had read all the specs and seen the pics of the camera, and wanted to find out if it was all style and no substance, or if there really was a heart inside the beast. The shop owners opened the box for me to inspect, attached the screen protector, strap and lens cap string, and I took it for a spin before I even left the shop.Before I say anything more, I'd better let you know my digital camera background. I've been using them ever since they first came out about 10 years ago. Sony DSC-30, Kyocera SL300 (world's first 3.3 fps limited only by size of memory card), Nikon S4, Canon 350D, Nikon s10, Nikon P90, Pentax k-x. In addition, I have always used mobile phones with cameras- xcute (world's first 3 mpxl mobile phone camera), SE k810, k850, Motorola ZN5, Samsung Innov8, SE Satio. So i've used a wide range of digital cameras.Initial feeling:1. Camera felt lighter than I expected, even with the 4 AA batteries in place.2. Solid plastic, yet at the same time a little hollow.3. Great grip- right side hand grip is deep and rubberised for gripping.4. Thankfully the lens cap has a string attaching it to the shoulder strap- no chance of losing it or wondering where to put the cap when you take it off.5. Lots of buttons at the back. Going to have to refer to the manual quite a bit.6. The \"chrome\" ring on the bottom right feels a bit cheap. Though I guess use of plastic helps reduce the weight.7. It's amazing how friendly store people can be once you buy something from them. I was dripping sweat- hot day, so they gave me a cup of water :)8. The screen is beautiful. I can't say it enough. It's very clear and bright, even with screen protector on.9. The lens has an INCREDIBLE zoom range- 24mm to 720mm (35mm format) and feels very smooth when you manually zoom.10. Zooming ring has good grip, but the pattern isn't attractive.11. Shop owner told me the lens is 58mm diameter- that's good because I can use my IR and UV filters.12. Electronic view finder is ok, but I find for \"bridge\" cameras they tend to be small in size. Only the dslr's have eyepieces which are a good size which is comfortable for your eye. Ignoring the size, the EVF quality is good, and you may have read about the sensor next to it, which activates the EVF when you bring your eye to it. So the 3 inch LCD screen turns off and the EVF turns on when you bring your eye to the EVF.What about the photos?13. Really good. I've taken about 100 photos so far, mostly at night. You have to be quite steady, even with the shake reduction function on (there are 4 options for shake reduction!!!), especially at the maximum zoom. But if you are, then the photo is very very good and sharp. Not quite as sharp as the Pentax k-x, which is known for it's low light performance, but it's pretty damn good. It's certainly good enough for me. Colours seem accurate and bright. Focusing in good light was pretty fast. Focusing in low level light was slower. In poor light it might even hunt for 2-4 seconds and flash a focusing light. It takes about 1 to 3 seconds to save a photo, so it's not high speed unless you use that function.14. The focusing is active. That is on auto, it will focus on faces, and even if those people are moving around, you can see the focus square remain glued to their face. My friends had to move side to side pretty fast for the HS-10 to lose the lock.There are so many fancy functions on this camera that I have really only just scratched the surface of what this baby can do. But I'm very glad to say there is substance in the HS-10. If you are in the market for a bridge camera, the HS-10 should definitely be on your shopping list.Added 15th April 2010.----------------------Despite the overcast and rainy conditions which plague me whereever I go, I've taken another 120 odd photos during the  periods of \"only\" cloudiness and intermittant sunshine.15. The photos are 24mm and at 720mm have differing sharpness. Colour is good for both though.At 24mm, you can see the whole photo, but you quickly see grainy outlines when you try to zoom in.At 720mm, the photo remains surprisingly sharp when you enlarge or zoom in on the photo. Not quite the same sharpness as my Pentax k-x, but much better than I expected.16. I've always had high zoom cameras and each time I buy up, I get surprised by how much closer I can get to a subject. This time though, I noticed something new. Usually, if I take a photo at the widest angle and then one at max zoom, you can see how much closer you can zoom in because you can usually see the surroundings around the object to compare with.This time however, you can zoom in on something that looks like a little dot in the 24mm photo and it's so close that you literally can't tell it's a zoomed up photo because it looks like a totally different photo.eg: I was on an overhead walkway and took a 24mm photo of the road. A traffic light was about 400 metres ahead. I zoomed in and I got a clear photo of the back of 2 cars and the licence plates. You'd think I had been standing just 5 metres away with a normal camera it was so good.In another example, I took a 24mm pic of an outside wall of a very colourful shopping centre. It's about 6 storeys high, so ground floor shop windows look like dots. When I zoomed to 720mm through the window, I got a very clear photo of the inside of the shop, with no reference to the outside of the building wall at all.This zoom is POWERFUL.I have no idea what the next generation of zoom lenses will allow us to do when they go to, say 850mm, 1000mm plus!17. f stops seems pretty good.I can take close ups of flowers and have both foreground and background nicely out of focus.18. Do keep a steady hand. Brace yourself against a pole or solid object if you can. It really helps in taking a sharp photo. It has good image stabilisation, but it's not a miracle worker.Thanks again all for reading :)Update 1st May 2010-------------------19. I've taken a few more photos and can say the following. The daytime photos are good. Not quite as good as my Pentax kx, but good. Sharpness, colour, detail are all more than acceptable. The lens is great for portraits, and the zoom speaks for itself. The tiltable screen makes the camera much more versatile than a fixed screen camera too.20. There are two areas that I find the camera disappointing.The first is the time needed to save each photo- 2 to 3 seconds. It's pretty slow. In comparison, my Pentax kx is just take the photo and instant save. Granted, most non dslr cameras are also non instant picture saving, but it seems even slower than my Nikon s10 and Kyocera sl300r, or even my Motorola ZN5 mobile phone.The second is photo viewing software. Firstly, it's not so easy to view multiple photos because it enlarges the picture you have the cursor on, so it covers the photos next to it. Secondly, as has already be noted by some disappointed reviewers, deleting a photo takes you right back to the end. If you've got hundreds or thousands of photos, that's a real irritant. It's true that holding down a direction on the chrome ring will very very quickly flick through the photos to get you back to where you were, but it's a real hassle.At least on the other hand, when you connect to the computer, there is only 1 folder for the photos, unlike my nikons, which have numerous folders \"100dscn\", 200dscn\" etc.21. Finally, I've taken a few videos and I've found the HD vids all look smooth on the camera LCD, but very jerky, kind of frame by frame, when i play on my computer. I don't have this problem if I record in 640 x 480 (320?) format though. It's probably my computer being old, but I wonder if anyone else has this problem?Thanks again for reading :)Edit 19th April 2011--------------------I ended up selling my HS10 last year for two main reasons. Writing times were too slow, and the software for reviewing photos was poor. I mean- deleting a photo and taking you to the very end again is pretty bad when you've got hundreds or thousands of photos on your card.But the reason I'm adding a bit here is that I've been following the reviews of the Fujifilm HS20, which was released recently. It seems to have taken care of most of the problems I mentioned- quicker writing speed, and viewing and deletion of photos, and added a new problem instead- overheating of some part of the camera, which causes the camera to cease working. I can say that for all the hundreds of photos I took with the HS10, I never had overheating for a problem.Such a pity that Fujifilm can't get such a fantastic camera right.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Finepix HS10 Exposed", "Author": "Kmrakid \"Kmrakid\"", "ReviewID": "R2PHQXL17A90PR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well...I did it! I made up my mind and purchased the Fujifilm Finepix HS10. After months of reviews, trials and testing, mainly between the HS10 the Sony HX1 and the Canon SX20 I spent the $500.00. First let me say the HX1 and the SX20 are great cameras and both offer things that should be incorporated into the HS10 and then again the HS10 has items that those cameras could use as well.I am a professional photographer and have been for over 30 years, I have owned everything from a Yashica TL-Electro to a Fujifilm AX-3 to a Nikon F3...and those were my early years. Since then I have had Fuji's lone of S Pro cameras as well as Nikon's and Canon's pro equipment so I know a few things about cameras and their capabilities. Ok, for my HS10 review.First let me say I was not sure about the manual zoom lens on a digital camera but then again I was used to them since I have plenty of SLR's. However, I must say I really like the manual zoom for still photographs but when it comes to the videos I really do not care for it. In the video mode it is just too jumpy for my taste and does not make for a smooth video. Also, believe it or not you can hear the manual zoom sounds on the video sound track but I have heard of other cameras, including the HX1, that has the same issues with their auto zoom so this is something the camera manufactures need to work on.The next issue I have is that the camera does have problems focusing when the lens is zoomed out all the way. If you back off the lens just a little bit it seems to focus fine just not at the full zoom. Other then that I have no other complaints about the camera...yet!The camera takes great photos, even low light without a flash or tripod and even fully zoomed. I used 4 \"AA\" Alkaline batteries and have taken over 400 photos and the camera is still going strong, no low battery indication as of yet. Out of all my \"full zoom\" photos, both inside and out, there are only about 2% that are out of focus. I have no problems with the EVF even though the size of the EVF is a bit small but it still works for me. The menus are clear and easy to understand but I find one aspect of it puzzling...If you place the camera into the silent mode, so there are no sounds audible, the flash shuts off and will not work not even manually. If you want the flash to work and not hear all the beeps and bells you have to turn the volume down on each, just a little strange for me.I really like the fact that you can use filters on the lens, it takes a 58mm filter but if you use the 24mm setting a lot you may want to get the slim frame filter to help stop the vignette that sometimes occurs in the full wide angle setting. I do find it strange that the camera does not come with a lens hood although it does come with a lens cap but that is usually standard with most cameras. The image stabilization works great, I have tried it many times, even grossly moving the camera while taking the picture and 9 times out of 10 the photo comes out on focus. There is some noise when you get to the 800 ISO and over range but that's to be expected, no camera is perfect.Anyway, that's my opinion for now, I am going on vacation next month so I will put the camera through it's paces then so I will post again later. All in all it's a great camera and I am very happy with the purchase, my only true regret is that the HS10 does not have an auto zoom feature.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "A questionable purchase", "Author": "Oldanalyst", "ReviewID": "R23NL6YN8LBKSK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": ".  .I had preordered the HS10 and was really anxious to try it out when I received it. I wasn't too anxious to use the video part of the camera as I intend mainly to use still shots. So I spent much of the weekend trying out various function of the camera. I set up a series of shots where I varied the ISO from 100 to 3600 and evaluated the results. As expected, the lower ISO settings produced little noise. In fact, noise levels were quite low even at ISO 800. I think one could be comfortable with all results at ISO 400 or less but still be reasonably satisfied with ISO 800. As expected, the higher the ISO, the more the noise but even ISO 6400 produced usable results. For most situations, this camera should produce very low noise shots.  .  .Unlike some of the reviewers, I like the modest weight of this camera. It helps me minimize shaking when I take pictures. I also like the tightness of the zoom. I had an expensive Nikon lens which was loose but moved in or out if the camera was held facing up or down (called lens creep). I have been using a Nikon D80 with a long zoom lens and this is a much heavier camera. This HS10 was to be used to compliment the D80 and be used in places where I did not want to take the D80. I picked the Fuji since I expected the lens system to be nearly as good as that of some DSLRs.  .  .I was right in that the quality of the lens is great and the stabilization is outstanding. I was able to get sharp images of printed material on license plates on cars about 400 feet away using full zoom and hand held. This really impressed me. On top of this, I found little distortion at full zoom with little to no purple fringing. This is better than the expensive Nikon lens I had been using. Again, impressive. I am not sure this will hold under all circumstances. I will let the expert reviewers determine this.  .  .I was able to figure out the menus fairly easily but did have to run back to my computer to read some information from the PDF manual. I know cost is a factor but a printed manual sure would help. The small printed material that comes with the camera is fairly trivial..  .Now for the negatives and they are significant. In taking about 220 pictures, I used 4 sets of batteries - 2 alkaline sets and 2 rechargeable sets. This is truly not acceptable and I am going to try to find out how to either return this camera or perhaps get a software fix (if there is one). This failing alone is enough to justify returning the camera. I have read others say that they had good battery life so mine may be a fluke.  .  .The second problem was with the time needed to save shots. I have been using a DSLR and was able to take RAW shots and save them with little lag time between shots. I expected the HR10 to have some lag but was not prepared for the 6-9 second delay between single shots for RAW. If you shoot burst mode, you can shoot multiple shots with no delay between shots. I did this of flying birds with great results. However, after the burst, if shooting RAW, there is over a 10 second delay as the shots are recorded. Even using JPEG produces a delay of ~5 seconds. I did not time the saving of RAW+JPEG mainly because I was frustrated by the time lag of RAW and JPEG alone.  .  .I have numerous SDHC level 6 cards and all give the same results when saving either JPEG (~3 sec) or RAW (~6 sec) shots. My wife has an underwater camera that requires SDHC/6 cards and at 10 megapixels, it takes less than a second to record JPEG.  To eliminate variation from cards, I used the internal memory to record some shots. Guess what? The same results. I can accept slower for RAW but JPEG should be fast. I read comments from another owner (on another site) who had the same problem with slow saving so perhaps there may have been some poor quality control with the making of this camera. I have had experience with 6 other digital cameras and this camera has a slow save.  .  .I will be contacting FUJI and probably Amazon since I feel I have a truly flawed camera. For those of you considering the HS10, you might want to wait until full reviews are out and see if my camera was simply a dud or if the FUJI HS10 does indeed have some major flaws.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Four and a Half Stars", "Author": "Roberto Vicente \"bodhiu\"", "ReviewID": "R3G8IWMWLFWF90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Four and a half starsJust got my HS10 yesterday and what surprised me literally first is that it looks and feels like a dslr. The camera isn't big at all and is light. All this with an excellent and very potent lens.Having had many dslr and p/s cameras I was able go through the menu even without reading the manual (Fuji doesn't include the full hard copy of the manual except as a pdf file on the disk--my major complaint about the camera!).The camera is light and easy to use, responsive and simple. Actually, a joy to use and manipulate. Upon further using the camera zoom, the overhead flash does stick out slightly to encumber the use of focusing on the zoom ring. A person with small hands probably won't have much of a problem, but those with larger hands may find it annoying. But you get past that once you see how nice and accurate the zoom is. The lens is sharp all the way through focus without any fringing (all glass in the lens according to Fuji).I shot in raw and there was a short time lag of 2-3 seconds per shot. I haven't tried it in rapid/continuous shooting yet to see if it can fire off a few raw shots (yes, the camera will shot 6 consecutive shots!).The lcd screen is nice and large and colorful. The view finder while nice that it has an automatic sensor that detects your eye, the image quality there is average. I understand that both lcd and view finder only show 97% of the picture which makes you scratch your head. But nothing too bad. The diopter to the viewfinder sharpened nicely according to your vision.As I shot the images in raw, what struck me was how beautiful and rich the shots were. Some pictures even had me applauding. The zoom is fantastic and to be able to go from wide to full zoom in just a snap is wonderful.  I've had dslrs and been lazy about changing lens. The convenience of an all-in-one lens is great. Camera image stabilization works nicely. I did notice that on aperture priority it only goes as far as f8, but in manual you can get f11. Another oddity.I would say that the HS10 is a mini dslr or dslr-like. The nay-sayers and nit pickers you see on the reviews here are being unfair, because they want some great Nikon/Canon dslr which in the end costs big bucks but for $500 with this kind of zoom, CMOS sensor, and many more features (panorama stitch mode, etc.) that the normal dslr doesn't carry, you can't go wrong.Later as I processed my raw photos I was truly impressed with the dslr quality of the images.  The Fuji/silky software is slow but hopefully there will be something out better soon.  Also, a firmware update by Fuji will easily enhance the camera's few foibles.  (I forgot to mention that after first getting the camera and seeing the excellent results I then put on a tinted filter which affected the color saturation.  I then purchased a clear lens filter and all the robust Fuji color is back.  CLEAR FILTER IS THE WAY TO GO!)I do recommend this camera in its class as a high end bridge camera or mini-dslr! More positives than negatives!Read the positive photoblog review on the camera.Also check out the many photos I've included here on Amazon.Good luck to all.  I'll try write later after I've gone through all the features.Third day out shooting I figured out the trick for when the camera doesn't want to focus, you must also set the camera in macro mode and that helps solidify the shot.  The camera sees a close up and thinks its a macro so you must also set the camera to macro!As of April 27, Fuji has a released a firmware update for the HS10!  Go to the Fuji website to update your camera performance.  Good luck.A second firmware update has been issued for the HS10 on May 24, 2010.From my trying it seems that spotmetering allows for the best exposure and shot making.  Without a doubt spotmetering is needed when at full zoom for distant shots to differentiate your subject lighting.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Update on print quality - loses one star, may

is such a complex little beastie. This is an amazing little camera for the price, which is less than I paid for my first 3 megapixel camera ten years ago.I have uploaded several photos to demonstrate some of the capabilities of this camera, and all of the shots were taken before I read the CD-based pdf manual. While I found some aspects of shooting with this camera frustrating, most of the problems I faced were due to the complexity of the camera and not having read the manual.The lesson here is - this is NOT a point and shoot camera. If you want to really push this beauty to its limits and squeeze all the good stuff out of it, you had better read the manual. There are many things which are not intuitive, although they are clearly explained in the manual, such as the different program shooting modes, and the fine points of using all the autofocus features. If you don't read the instructions first, I guarantee you will be frustrated. Shooting video is one of the things which will drive you crazy if you don't read the manual first.That is not a negative. Any sufficiently complex device will require the same, and this camera has an amazing array of features.It is essentially a low-end digital SLR (Single Lens Reflex - means you sight through the lens), and that is a mixed bag. One the one hand, you have many of the advantages of a pro SLR, such as the zoom lens (more on that later), and the ability to use regular photo filters on the lens (58mm). All the shots I show here were taken with a polarizer and a UV filter. One the other hand, you lose the ability to change lenses, and the viewfinder is electronic, not optical,which makes it harder to use.On balance, I think they have the feature set about right for the price point. The true \"killer feature\" is the 30 power zoom lens. This lens takes one from the 35mm equivalent of a 24mm wide angle to a super telephoto equivalent of 720mm! That is astonishing, and I doubt you will find a lens like that in the 35mm world. Despite the radical zoom range, the lens manages to keep a reasonable quality of image over most of the range. Those with 35mm experience will be in shock, and those not familiar enough to understand what that means will just have to look at my example photos.Pros:Fantastic optical zoom rangeAA battery power with advanced battery selection and managementSD card slot in addition to 46 megs of internal memoryVideo modeGreat range of advanced features, like moving object removal, etc.10 megapixels with many quality and size settingsRugged build qualityPartially articulated LCD panelCaptures Raw images for those who prefer thatDiopter adjustment on viewfinder for those with glassesCons:Some poor ergonomic choices, like the right hand grip being too close to the lens for easy use. Should have made the camera just a bit larger, and used actual ergonomics, not just trying to look like a big SLR (many of which also have poor ergonomics)Autofocus assist lamp located where it will be blocked by you right hand when shootingMicrophones hidden under flash hood on either side of lensSeveral buttons on the left side of the LCD panel are easily bumped, putting you into different modes accidentallyManual focus very hard to useLCD and electronic viewfinder very difficult to use in bright sunlightVideo record button not labeled, only an orange dot on itVideo mode not the greatest - don't give up your HD camcorder just yetOn balance, for the price it is a useful and fun camera. I found myself wishing I had taken it with me on a recent short trip, where I tried to capture a striking vista with my Canon 720IS. The Fuji would have done a much better job. The fact that it is a solid, useful camera with an amazing 30 power zoom which can also use regular filters, makes this my new camera of choice beyond the basic pocket camera  and short  of a  full-blown pro SLR.If you want to get into more serious photography, but don't want to shell out 2 grand, this would be an excellent introductory SLR to begin with. For not much more than a good pocket camera, you gain many features of professional SLRs, including manual focus, extensive exposure control, various in-camera editing features, and other advanced features like moving object removal.This is the camera I wanted ten years ago when I got my first digital. Thank you Fuji, for creating my dream camera. (Well, in this price range, anyway. Let's face it, the RED Epic is pretty dreamy - if you have 30 grand or more....)There are only a few change I wish they would make, and I will discuss those in the video I am planning to make to add to this review.Now, the pix:These were all shot on the same day in about an hour, from the same location with the same tripod. While the Fuji had a polarizer and UV filter, the Canon does not offer those options. While this may not be a fair comparison in some respects, I prefer to have a UV filter protecting my lens, and a polarizer is very helpful in reducing reflections and increasing saturation outdoors. I would use them on the Canon if I had that option. I think the difference in the two cameras is clear, despite the advantage of the filters.Five of the pictures are from my Canon Powershot A720 IS, for comparison. This has been my camera of choice for many years, and I consider it an outstanding value in a pocket camera. It is the reference camera for my camera reviews (well, until now maybe......).I tried to replicate images to compare the zoom range of both cameras (the Canon is an 8 megapixel with a 4 power zoom). While not exact, I think they clearly show the extreme zoom range of the Fuji HS10 compared to the Canon 720 IS.The first three Canon shots, 722, 723, and 724, go from the Canon's widest to most telephoto, in order. This is a 4 power zoom range, and is what I consider the lowest useful range in a still camera.The next two are black and white versions of picture 724, with one pushed in contrast. The same settings in the same program (the Gimp - Linux version - brightness down -15 and contrast up +50) were used on Fuji pictures, 132 and 136 for comparison of sharpness between the two cameras, and to show the difference in brightness and contrast in the default settings.Fuji pictures 106, 108, and 109 demonstrate the zoom range of 30 power. The zoom is continuously variable over that range, with indicator markings at various equivalent positions, such as 50mm, 200mm, etc. I picked three images just to illustrate the extremes. The mountains are well beyond 20 miles away.Fuji pictures 130, 131, 132, and 136 demonstrate the Fuji's zoom range in comparison with the Canon 720 IS. The Canon only reaches to about the 200mm equivalent on the Fuji (Fuji 132). The mountain, which is barely visible in the Fuji's wide shot, is about 20 miles or so away from where I was shooting. Can you count the microwave dishes on the tower in the 720mm shot (Fuji136 - try the high contrast black and white version)? Amazing range.Fuji 140 was an unplanned, off the cuff shot, taken rapidly without any chance to check settings or mode. I saw a hawk flying by, grabbed the camera, turned it on, framed quickly with no chance to check focus, and just snapped - hoping to catch something semi-usable. I was amazed that I got anything at all. On a closer look at home, I realized that the hawk was imaged reasonably well under the circumstances, and I could even see the ground squirrel she was carrying back to her nest. With more practice and reading the manual, this could be a fun camera for wildlife photography.I did encounter some color artifacts at the widest telephoto range of the Fuji, but only in one shooting mode. There appears to be some pinkish color shifting on the right one-third of the image, mostly at the top. I did not encounter this when experimenting with another setting, and have not had time to extensively test for conditions where this will happen. Test pictures I did do were too big to load on Amazon. Be aware of this possibility.Feel free to do side by side comparisons of these pictures to judge for yourself. I think both cameras are good, but the zoom range and higher pixel count on the Fuji definitely wins the day.I think it is a great little camera with amazing abilities and huge potential. I hope to show some of these things more clearly in the video.UPDATE: March 2011I've found a serious glitch in the picture quality recently. Earlier, I had noticed some strange patterning in the images, but assumed that was due to image processing in the software I was using. I recently tried printing some pix on my new Brother printer, and got some pretty pronounced banding in the images from this camera. Since these were not processed in any way, but were just the basic jpegs straight from the camera, I assume they are artifacts from the sensor or internal processing. The banding is vertical, evenly spaced, and extremely visible in areas of smooth color gradients like sky. It does not appear in similar pix from my Canon 720IS printed at the same time on the same printer, so I assume it is the camera.This is very distressing and I've docked a star already. I plan to do more testing against the 720IS and a new Canon SX130IS I just bought, and will report back when I have hard data. If it is as bad as I think, I will deduct another star from the rating.In fairness, there are some firmware upgrades out for this camera, and the sparse info does mention processing problems which may be related to what I am seeing. However, given that the process has to be done very carefully to keep from bricking the camera, I may not test that. The images are still okay for online and computer use, they just look like crap printed out. I'm disappointed - ruined some great shots of Mt. Hood I'd taken. This camera may be headed for the back shelf.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pleasing, Innovative Camera", "Author": "Brian M. Edwards", "ReviewID": "R3E4TTZ8IVDMCG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been trying this camera out for about 5 days now and overall I ma satisfied with it. There was a lot of hype and high expectations for weeks prior to its release and it meets some expectations and in my opinion does not quite meet others but that could be my lack of expertise and the need for more practice.It is a nice sized camera, weight proportionate with many neat features, some I am still sorting through but generally,the quality of the photos are very good and the 1080 HD video extremely good.  As it seems with most digital cameras the better the light, the better the quality of the photos and video.The manual zoom is nice and works well though it seems to be jerky (maybe it will smooth out with time. The 30X optical is very good and I have uploaded several photo's some of which are close up's of a Green jay which came very well. The night scene which I uploaded disappointed me but since uploading it, I have adjusted it with Photo-shop Elements and it came out fairly decent. it is worth saying that the noise on that pic' appears to be fairly low.The video and still have plenty of battery life auto setting has worked fairly well for me as has many of the other settings, others I  need more time to experiment with and will add a later update.Battery life seems to be pretty good, I have taken about 150 photos and maybe 25 minutes of video with the Alkaline batteries that came with it.The build quality is reasonable, I have seen better (and I have seen worse!) but I think it should last me quite a while.It did come with software though I have not used it.My main reason for wanting this camera is to be able to take quality pictures of my friends & family, of wildlife and a few sports events thus the need for a long zoom and this camera will do what I need.Low light capability is not quite up to my expectations (yet), and I find the zoom a bit jerky but overall it appears to be a good camera that, in my opinion is a bit overpriced and I expect this camera to be selling for less than the list price within a few months (I have already seen it on marked down on one site but still preferred to buy from amazon). I also suspect that Fuji will bring out a firmware update fairly soon to address a few issues I have seen on forums.I always say that the most important thing a camera should do is take great photos, and it pretty much satisfies me in that area. The video and a few other features make it worthwhile to me.If you are thinking of buying this camera, it get my approval but check out some forums to see if it suits you (there are some really good expert opinions and uploaded pic's that should help most folks with their decision.UPDATE 9-4-2010 Still happy with the camera, I wanted to post a note about a comment a reviewer posted in his review that he is using a Vivitar 2800 D accessory flash, well I immediately went onto ebay and found a used one as a buy-it-now for $16.00. I ordered it and have been trying it out. It is a really nice flash that was a bargain for the price. It's important to note that the reviewer says it must be the  2800 D and NOT the 2800 (minus the D) because he says that model has a different voltage.I just wanted to let everyone know that if you need a decent flash that is an absolute bargain, give the 2800 D a shot, it woks very well!", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is NOT a DSLR, but it's pretty dang good", "Author": "A. McCullough", "ReviewID": "R2PVSOJDM85MTP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've seen reviewers call this camera a mini-DSLR - it's not. It's a fixed-lens bridge camera with a small image sensor and a simply massive 30x OPTICAL zoom, period - there's no mirror to get out of the way as a DSLR would have nor interchangeable lenses. Now that the nomenclature is out of the way - it's a VERY GOOD bridge camera with excellent lens sharpness, vivid color reproduction and overall quite good image quality up to ISO 800 (which is very good for this category of camera). I've taken over 1400 hundred images with mine thus far, and have been extremely pleased with the unit overall. The image stabilization is surprisingly good (a necessity if you're fully racked out without a tripod!!) and I don't really have a quarrel with battery life, unlike many posters here; I've updated the camera with both firmware updates (one of which addressed the issue with the battery warning light coming on too soon) and I get about the same usage out of a set of Eneloops with this camera as I do with its predecessor, an Olympus Sp570UZ (also a very good bridge camera with a 20x zoom). Frankly I've never really counted the shots, but I did get something like 300+ images (many of which involved the onboard flash) in one afternoon's shoot before the battery light came on. You can usually get another 30-40 shots before the camera shuts down when that light kicks in.What I like:1) Obviously, the zoom. There are three focusing ranges - tele, macro, and supermacro, and if you find you can't focus in any of the modes you're probably out of the range for that mode. Simply switching modes can bring you into a decent focus area (although you may still have to \"focus with your feet\" a little bit depending on what you're shooting). The lens is pleasingly sharp throughout its range with well-controlled chromatic aberration - not a whole lot of \"purple fringing\" to be found here. I find the manual zoom to be quite smooth and easily controlled.2) The control feature set. There are a number of mode presets or you can go fully manual where you choose the shutter and aperture - this is my preferred method but it has to be said that this camera's \"auto\" modes are pretty good. You have the full range of DSLR-style control modes - P, A, S, M along with quite a few varied scene modes (I was seriously impressed with the \"fireworks\" scene mode).3). This lens is threaded - you can use 58mm filters easily. I use a circular polarizer frequently. It can even do some basic infrared photography with an inexpensive IR filter attached - it's not the best camera for that application but it is indeed capable.4). Weight and handling. It's a fairly hefty camera (all that glass has to go somewhere) but it's well balanced and though I have small hands I have no problem with it. The battery well forms a nicely-shaped handgrip and the HS10 feels quite good to shoot.5). Unlike a lot of reviewers, I LIKE the fact that the camera takes AA's - being able to run into the 7/11 and grab a set of alkalines has saved my bacon in the past with a couple of cameras when I've been too dense to recharge the spares!6) Noise doesn't become a serious issue until you get past ISO 800; up to that point, most images are very good or at the most can be \"tweaked\" lightly with a quick run through of your favorite noise reduction software (I use Adobe Lightroom 3 which has FANTASTIC n/r).7) The supermacro mode is excellent. You can get as close as one centimeter to your subject without any additional lenses. I have a Raynox DCR250 that I can use with this camera if I wish to get even closer, but out of the box the Fuji's macro range is impressive.8) The onboard flash is actually quite good; this camera boasts an \"Intelligent Flash\" system which actually does reasonably well at controlling blowouts and makes for an excellent fill flash mode. There is a hot shoe as well - while there is no dedicated flash available for this model, one flash that can be used is the older Vivitar 2800D (NOTE THE \"D\"!!!) which is pretty easy to come by on eBay and works very well with this camera. Do NOT buy the 2800 Vivitar - its trigger voltage is too high, you'll fry the camera. Be sure to get the D designation.9) Menus are intuitive and very complete - there's a setting for nearly everything you can think of including white balance adjustments.The few things I don't like:1) For a bridge camera that uses an LCD/EVF viewfinder system, it's not really a \"live view\"; what you see in the viewfinders isn't necessarily what your finished image will be. If you've severely underexposed it, for example, there's a \"light meter\" gauge in the bottom right of the screen that you'll need to train yourself to watch because the view you're looking at won't generally reflect the true scene as the camera will see it. Coming from a Panasonic FZ28 and an Olympus SP570, both of which DO show you what your image will look like, this took a while to get used to.2) Come on, Fuji - a printed manual would be nice. What ships with the camera is essentially a pamphlet that doesn't even begin to cover the model's functions. I printed it out from the PDF on the CD and got it bound myself.3) This camera's \"low light\" capability is a bit overrated, though that shouldn't be a surprise, given how much glass the light has to get through - for most indoor shots (especially if there's kids or pets) you will need that flash. The Pro Low Light mode works if there's no moving objects in the scene - it won't do you a bit of good if you're trying to photograph your child bouncing on the bed, for example.Overall, this camera is a great model for learning how to shoot manually or just as a \"grab it in Auto mode and start shooting\". It's not perfect, but it's close enough for the type of shooting I do. I don't use it for video, nor do I shoot RAW, and I don't shoot action/sports venues, so I can't speak to its qualities in those areas.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great all around camera and value!", "Author": "C. Smith \"C. Smith\"", "ReviewID": "R6BAMNDA5X9ES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a multi-lens SLR for years, and my Fuji Finepix HS10 for about 3 weeks. I have taken about 300 test shots with it to test many of the features and functions as well as learning how to use it.  Overall, I am very pleased with it. Image quality (IQ) is quite good, and it's fairly easy to use.  The flexibility and number of features enables it to compete with basic DSLR's.Lens:  The OPTICAL zoom range is incredible (24 - 720mm)in a single lens!  The overall performance of the lens is outstanding. Having a 24 - 720mm zoom range, there is no need to change lenses. Yipee! Say good bye to lugging around several lenses, and having to change them all the time!Fuji has taken a lot of time to carefully design and engineer this camera. To get the most out of it, I've thoroughly read (and follow) the manual and have had great results.  Most of the issues written by users I feel may be (IMHO) operator error; not following the manual.  The manual however, could be somewhat clearer regarding some of the settings. Examples: Some of the settings / adjustments (ISO, White Balance, etc.) work only in modes other than Automatic or SR (which makes sense, but should be more clearly stated).  Ref. page 49 \"Autofocus Mode\" - \"Area\" and \"Tracking\" modes work only when face detection is turned off which is not noted in the manual.Examples of what I feel may be user errors / comments:Battery life.  NiMH batteries must go through 3 - 5 full charge / discharge cycles for them to operate at full capacity -this is why the camera has a battery discharge function! Brand-new NiMH batteries will not operate at full capacity until they have been discharged and recharged multiple times. I have found when the camera displays the red low battery icon, there is still significant battery life left; giving the user plenty of notice.  I am using Sanyo Eneloop's which have 2,000 mAh capacity and worked great.Ergonomics / lens zoom & manual focus operation:  I find the manual zoom ring near the camera body, and zoom function to be smooth and both are easily operated. The other controls are well placed and with practice can be used without looking.Write speed: I have found the shot-to-shot time to be fine. Be sure to format the SD / SDHC card IN THE CAMERA before use(again, read and follow the manual!)! Use \"Class 6\" or higher SDHC cards - especially for video capture (the \"Class\" number indicates the write speed - the higher the number, the faster the write speed). Also be sure to update the firmware when new versions are available (again, follow the manual!).The flexibility and control of shooting modes (fully automatic to fully manual), control of aperture and depth-of-field (DOF), shutter speed, sensitivity (ISO), white balance, color settings enables the HS10 to compete with DSLR's.Focusing: Generally, the camera takes sharp photo's, however at time I have found while in Auto mode, the camera may not focus on subjects when zoomed-in all the way.  Switching to SR Auto puts the camera in macro mode and the camera will then focus. I've called Fuji to let them know.  The camera should focus regardless of the mode in which it's operating.I like the chrome color setting for outdoor photo's - accentuates greens and blues.I have been a 3-lens SLR user for many years, and have found this camera was a great choice for me - a single lens w/ a 24 - 720 mm focal length range, a great combination of features, good IQ, flexibility, functionality, and at the price a great value!", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fuji HS10--getting better with time", "Author": "Jazzphile", "ReviewID": "R1JRN6YMI3UDXW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After owning the camera for about a month, time for a brief review.  Like many of the prior reviewers, I struggled with image quality out of the box.  Focus when at near max or max zoom is unreliable.  Sometimes it comes out, sometimes not.  Manual focus is good, but tough to zero in on due to less than great resolution of the screen and electronic viewfinder.  But it does work.  Complaints about the manual focus ring and zoom ring are not relevant to me.  I have adjusted to both just fine.I am an amateur photographer who just takes pics for my own enjoyment.  After having played with the settings and such for a month, I finally got serious with some photos recently.  Took many in RAW instead of JPEG.  Camera's JPEG photos are a bit soft with aggressive noise reduction, as others have pointed out.  However, when I started to shoot in RAW, and do post processing with the SilkyPix software, the true capabilities of the camera, when proper focus and exposure are achieved, became evident.  It is a far better camera shooting in RAW with post processing.  Surprisingly good, actually.There are still those shots that just don't come out right on auto or SR auto.  This occurs more than other point and shoots in my experience, and I have a Panasonic with 10x zoom that is more consistent.  But, I sort of expect that with a 30x zoom.In good to decent light, shooting in RAW, with post processing, you can really achieve some excellent results with amazing levels of detail.  But, the key is to shoot in RAW.  You will not get the same level of detail in JPEG.I have to agree with many other reviewers, you must take the time to get to know this camera.  It's only the past few days that I've really started to achieve special results for some of my photos.Shooting time is slow when in RAW or RAW + JPEG.  Shooting time in JPEG is decent.  Write times are slow in RAW or RAW + JPEG.  The 7 frames per second in JPEG or 6 in RAW work well, when you are able to achieve proper focus and exposure in that first shot.Lately I've thought about getting a DSLR, which I didn't want to do.  Too expensive and heavy with additional lenses.  But now that I've started to shoot in RAW and post process photos, I'll be less inclined to buy a DSLR for a while.  My intent was to buy this camera, enjoy the massive zoom, and learn how to use a camera that otherwise operates much like a DSLR with manual, semi manual and automatic modes to suit any environment.  This camera is allowing me to learn all of the ins and outs.Battery life is good using Sanyo Eneloops or other hybrid rechargeables.  The screen is good, not great.  I have a Panasonic with 460k pixels, double the resolution of the Fuji, and the difference in quality is stunning.  However, the EVF on the Fuji is useful if not great, and I like having it.  I would have liked to see higher quality monitor and EVF, but at the price I can understand why Fuji didn't include them.It seems clear to me that Fuji spent most of the money on this camera on the lens, which is excellent.  Little barrel distortion or purple fringing, and amazing zoom quality.  At full zoom it's tought get a crisp shot while hand held, but that's to be expected.  Otherwise, the zoom is amazing.  Using a tripod would help, no doubt, but I haven't tried that yet.All in all I'm pleased but this is not a perfect camera and requires \"care and feeding\", and a learning curve, to get the best out of it.  It is capable of some pretty amazing results once you become familiar with it, and are willing to shoot in RAW, suffer slower write times, and do post processing in SilkyPix.If you are not willing to take the time to do this, then you might want to look elsewhere if you are picky about image quality.  If you can live with good, but not great image quality, then I can recommend this camera for those who do not want to shoot in RAW.  Also, be ready for some photos that just are not focused properly from time to time.  I think this has to do with the amazing lens and zoom not being perfectly in sync with the camera's focus sensor.  There are ways to work around the issue, but again, you have to learn the camera.A couple of other observations:  There are plenty of manual and scene modes here for just about any scenario.  It is tough to shoot wildlife with this camera if the wildlife is moving.  Camera is not that fast to respond.  Camera has the ability to take macro and super macro with sometimes amazing results, but the resuls I have found to be inconsistent in macro and super macro.  I have not yet zeroed in on why.  You can achieve some pretty cool \"bokeh\" with this camera when zooming in and using macro.  Above ISO 800, you will have quite a bit of smudge and noise.  400 is pretty darned good, 800 is acceptable.I sound critical in this review, but really, just giving you the quirks and traits of a very capable camera in the right hands.  I'd buy it again.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Real Life Review", "Author": "Frank Forrest \"Quasar\"", "ReviewID": "R1D53AJ7IKSMHC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "People Like the HS10--------------------First off, this camera can be a fun camera to use and that's probably one reason why some people like this camera. I liked this camera initially but as time wore on there were just too many snags that ultimately gave me reason to return it.The Deal Breaker: False Battery Status--------------------------------------The first one everyone will be familiar with is the false low-battery status message that this camera displays. Although freshly charged batteries were used, in less than an hour and fifty shots later, the camera shut itself down. The batteries were discharged prior to charging as per instructions, the battery selector was set to \"N\" for NiMh, and the rating of the batteries was 2000mah. Other HS10 users have been able to take 500 shots or more with this power rating so it isn't necessarily connected to higher mah ratings.Firmware 1.03--------------The problem for this bug was fixed in firmware version 1.02 but my camera was shipped with version 1.03. Yes, there is a newer version. But apparently, the old bug has resurfaced with 1.03 and the battery problem is alive and well. And no, you cannot downgrade back to 1.02 if you get a camera shipped with 1.03.As mentioned before new battery performance (NiMh) is only 50 shots and less than an hour of shooting time before the camera shuts down (at least on my HS10). This is the real deal breaker for me. I called Fuji USA and the techs were in total denial about this issue. \"We never heard of a HS10 battery problem,\" was their response. At that point, they lost all credibility with me as well as my respect for their customer support. I'm not sure if all newly shipped HS10s exhibit this problem, but mine did. Be sure to take this into consideration if you are contemplating the purchase of the HS10.The HS10: The Good and the Bad---------------------------------As far as all around performance, it has a nice range of in-camera effects, fair low-light shooting capabilities, and of course, the 28-720mm monster zoom lens. Its auto focus isn't always spot on when in macro mode, contrasty scenes and in the shade; the percentage of properly focused images was only 1 in 20 when shooting flowers in the garden with average zoom using the auto focus. The noise from images above ISO 400 can be a bit much and the overall picture quality is about par for the course. The viewfinder imgae is totally insufficient in size and my guess is that Fuji forgot to add the proper diopter lens to it to magnify the display properly. This renders the viewfinder virtually useless because it is small...really, really small.The Big Picture----------------The HS10 offers some interesting features for a certain demographic, and if you fall into the category of photographers that has primarily used point and shoot cameras, the HS10 offers you an interesting bag of tricks. There are bells and whistles on this camera and this may give you a certain amount of entertainment for a time.The slow motion video feature is virtually useless if you are planning to use the highest 1000fps setting because the frame size is only an inch or so in width (Fuji conveniently leaves this info out on their advertisements). Low light performance for outdoor shooting or overcast conditions will require bumping up the ISO to at least 800, but this is also where lots of noise starts to show up in photos. If the scene you are shooting is busy or you're zooming in, the auto focus won't be able to select the proper lock-on. For 4x6 prints, vacation shots, or informal picture taking, the HS10 may suit your needs while giving you the look of using a DSLR.Conclusion------------If you are seeking a camera that has a respectable battery life, good low-light capabilities, good auto focus, and good image quality, you may want to hedge your bets by looking at other models. Don't let the siren call of a 30x zoom lens lull you into its spell because it's the overall performance of a camera that matters.Perhaps the next iteration of the HS10 will solve many of the problems you have read about. But until then, make sure you do your homework by checking out as many reviews on this camera as possible as well as user experiences posted on the Internet.I was well aware of all the issues revolving around the HS10 but hoped against hope that they weren't all valid. In my particular case, and sadly, many of the concerns proved to be true. (Yes, I read the whole camera manual so no user error here. ;D) It's very possible that there are quality control issues surrounding the HS10 and it may just be a matter of getting one of the good ones. In any event, a throw of the dice is a little disconcerting in order to get a unit that works.Final Thoughts: FujiFilm USA------------------------------Fuji USA proved to me that they do not care about its customers when they have issues with their products; specifically speaking, the HS10. With this sort of support, or lack thereof, it made it apparent that FujiFilm will not back up its products once you purchase them. This is unfortunate because brand loyalty is destroyed and this will eventually hurt sales. As far as FujiFilm cameras, I won't be back.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Talented Camera, Great Pictures!", "Author": "Rachel Barr", "ReviewID": "R1DPYO2PS1PD0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROSFull manual controlSensible and usable scene modesSweep panoramasTilting LCDRAW captureVery good dynamic rangeManual zoomTremendous focal rangeMinimal lens distortionNear-nonexistent chromatic aberrationsEVF/LCD auto switchHi-def, stereo moviesGood low-light performanceCONSAutofocus not always accurateLens flare and haloing sometimes a problemFrustrating macrosSlow shot-to-shot times, especially RAWJerky video zoomLCD hard to see in bright lightPathetic electronic viewfinderDynamic Range setting limited to higher ISOsLarge movie filesNo printed advanced manualI'm a semi-professional photographer who shoots most often in manual mode, and I purchased the HS10 primarily for outdoor stills.  There are a couple of grandkids that preempt scenic beauty, though, so I have some experience shooting people, as well.I've had the HS10 for five months now, and it's been a love-hate relationship every step of the way. The HS10 is not as fun to use as some others I've owned, but for its convenience factor and image quality alone, the compromises are worth it. I simply cannot always use my D-SLR in the desert. This camera takes the best pictures of any ultrazoom I've used, and that's what it's all about, isn't it? Getting great pictures.Admittedly, if I were to put the camera down when I hit a snag and headed for my laptop to read the advanced manual, I'd probably be much more at ease with the HS10. But there's the rub--when I'm outdoors shooting, the laptop's not within reach. So, despite having shot several thousand photos with it, I know I'm still not using this camera to its fullest potential. Even when I do have my laptop handy, to my tastes the PDF format is an unsatisfactory way to study camera settings.When the HS10 delivers, it knocks it all the way out of the park. I'm very, very pleased with the landscapes I've taken--in bright light, low light, contrasty light or muted light. Colors are pretty faithful, contrast is excellent, and images are clear, both corner-to-corner and edge-to-edge. At the shortest focal length, photos are razor sharp, and at the long end of the zoom, they're nice and clear to just shy of the 30X limit. And the colored fringing that plagued my Canon PowerShot S and SX series models is practically nonexistent. So are lens distortions (that is, unless you shoot RAW only--then you see pretty quickly how well the camera processes JPEGs, eliminating those nasty little niggles).Portraits are less great, and macro photography is something I've almost given up on. It's not that the camera can't handle people--it just can't figure out what to do about their skin! And in macro mode, unless the background is practically a featureless plane, that's where the camera tends to focus. No matter how obvious the subject might seem to the eye.I've not used the various Scene modes very frequently and some of the more gimmicky features not at all. But the times I've ventured outside PASM, I've been quite pleased with the results. Given its own head, this camera knows what to do.White balance is sort of a squirrelly proposition. For the first time in years I find that the auto WB setting is often the best selection. Not always...it's a good idea to run through the options every time the light changes, because what worked before just might not be the best from another angle. Indoors is the trickiest--there really isn't a setting that faithfully reproduces colors under artificial lighting. However, it's not that far off the mark, and, overall, indoor shots are quite pleasing.If you're a pixel peeper, you'll discover that at about 50% magnification noise and artifacts show up in the images, even at the lowest ISOs. At 100% magnification it's pretty much a mine field. However, viewed at lower magnifications, images are crisp and natural looking. It's a rare incident that I need a photo printed at 100% magnification or even 33%.The LCD is very difficult to see outdoors, and the EVF is at best mediocre--distorted and full of rainbows and haloing. And that's why the HS10 is less fun to use than previous cameras I've owned. Because most of my shooting is done outside, I too frequently find viewing the subject a struggle. However, that tilting LCD is mighty handy for overhead and low-level shots, and I really have enjoyed the feature that automatically switches the LCD off and the EVF on as I raise the camera to my eye.As others have mentioned in their reviews, the resolution of the LCD is too low for the manual focus feature to be of much benefit. But it's better than nothing at all when you're on your knees trying to get the dandelion in focus and not the grass behind it.I've grabbed some nice video clips with the HS10; there's some jerking as the lens zooms, and there's sometimes a jello effect, but the camera autofocuses quickly on its subject(s) and tracks well. There ARE better hybrid camera options for videos. My husband has a Nikon P100 that videos circles around my HS10--but my camera takes much better stills, and that's exactly what I bought it for.Not a single shooting session goes by that at some point I don't hiss, \"I'm selling this and getting something I can use!\" And not a single session goes by that I don't exult, \"What is a GREAT camera!\" Go figure.Hey, I've still got it. It's the one that I grab the most.

It is a point and shoot, but the look and feel of the camera makes one quickly think that it is more than it really is. It is heavier than most models in its class. It feels solid in the hand and is well designed as far as controls and button locations. I have larger than average hands and found the HS 10 by far the easiest to hold.This camera is capable of incredible shots at most any range. The manual focus is a real plus. While the camera has what seems like endless automatic shooting options, I find it works best in the C (custom) mode with good to bright light and the Night Tripod mode in low to very little light. I have taken shots outside at midnight with nothing more than the light from a window in my front yard with unbelievable results. I even took a shot of the Big Dipper that came out very well. And no flash in the world is going to reach the Big Dipper, LOL. Bottom line, the low light capabilities of this camera are fantastic.Now for that monster zoom. You won't believe it. At the time of purchase there were only two cameras offering this big time zoom ability. The other being the Olympus SP-800uz. That is a fine camera also, but the two share very little in common other than the zoom and can't really be compared. I liken this zoom to a car that goes 200 mph. You may not need it all the time, but it's nice to know you can if the need arises. The auto focus can be a bit problematic at full extension, but once you learn the nuances of the thing those problems are greatly reduced.I've read many a review talking about the slow write speed of this camera and they are correct, it is a bit slow, but I would argue that if you have done your research before hand you would have known this going in and it shouldn't be a surprise. There are trade offs with all of these products and models. Slow write speed vs mega zoom vs lightweight vs specific options and so on. IMHO you should not let the slow speed scare you off unless you are doing professional sports shooting or something similar in which case you should not be using a point and shoot in the first place.PROS:NICE FEEL IN THE HAND. Heavy (comparatively), well balanced and well laid out.MANUAL ZOOM. I love the control this features allows and the fact that manual zoom means less battery drain.AA BATTERIES. Buy decent batteries and use a card reader or AC adapter and battery life is a non-issue. Battery availability and recharging is an unnecessary hassle that AA completely alleviates.OPTIONAL SETTINGS. Fairly easy to learn the different auto settings and how well they do under different conditions. Some are much better than others so this requires a bit of playing around to figure out what works for you.TILT SCREEN. If you are looking at multiple cameras and have basically decided what you want and are trying to figure what might tip the scale one way or the other, this feature alone makes this camera a great choice. Doesn't have the pixels of most cameras in this class, but is the only one with the tilt feature at this price. I can't say enough about this and how much it comes into play. Especially when attached to a tripod. No more bending over or standing on tip toe.CONS:I really have but one complaint concerning this camera. The on/off switch is a bit difficult to turn off. It's easy to switch on, but for some reason I have a hard time going the other direction to turn it off. Irritating, yes but not a reason to dismiss this camera.I know this is a bit long and if you made it all the way through I hope it was at least a little helpful. This is a great camera, extremely versatile and simply a pleasure to use. Once you see it you will understand why folks compare it to a DSLR but please remember that it is not.

What I needed from a camera was on that I could get good pictures of birds with while out hiking with my family. With the 30x zoom of this camera, no problem. I can zoom in on birds without scaring or startling them. It's compact enough that it fits into a Lowepro Adventura 140 Camera Case for me to carry while I'm out.It's well built and feels substantial, the auto-focus works fairly quickly or has for me so far.I'm using high capacity NiMH rechargeable batteries with it, and the battery life has been fairly good. I keep an extra charged set on hand when out taking pictures.I also needed a camera that would take good close up shots of beadwork and other crafts. This focuses in very well close up to everything I've tried it on so far.What I wanted was a camera I could grow into. One that I could use straight out of the box for the things above, and still could use to learn more about photography with. I got that too. I'm slowly learning a lot more about photography by switching modes from auto-focus to being able to adjust just one thing at a time and practicing. It is hybrid enough that it can be used in auto-focus mode by people used to point and shoots with a lot more capability than a standard point and shoots and still has enough very real features to let you learn all those neat photography tricks people do with DSLRs.I have small hands, and so far that hasn't been a problem. There is a full manual available, I'm not sure if it's on the cd that came with the camera since I downloaded it from the Fujifilm site before getting my camera.

The weight of pro cameras is really a disadvantage to me.

I think this happens in macro when I ask the camera to do something it cannot do.The print manual that comes in the box is not a complete manual.It is somewhat interesting to get used to a manual zoom ring.  Not bad.  Just different than what I am used to.I will edit this review as I get more experience with this camera.

Because once the talking and praising and grumping is all done what matters is not what we say in reviews- but what kind of photographs can the camera actually produce?I think it does a good job of flower macros, and anyone who likes to shoot flower macros will be glad to get in close, down to one cm.  It does a nice job with landscape shots as well.The reviews you are getting here are from camera pros with pro cameras who both love and hate this camera, from people who are unfamiliar with cameras and hate this camera because they can't seem to get it to work, and other just regular folks.

Gifford", "ReviewID": "R1L2284MIKP2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an avid amateur photographer who wanted to step up a notch to a megazoom camera without all the extra lenses. Some that I reviewed were Canon, Panasonic, Kodak and the Fuji HS10.The Fuji HS10 on paper was the best of the bunch. It was ironic that while I was considering this camera, my last months issue of Popular Photography did a feature article on the Fuji and gave it pretty high marks across the board.Once it arrived, I was impressed with its DSLR body and its durability. After putting the batteries in it, I was immediately taking photos without even reading the basic manual. I was impressed with the photo quality, click to capture speed, tilting LCD screen and the EVF with the electronic eye. The 30x optical zoom is top notch in this camera. Shooting at high ISO's, this camera has exceptionally low amounts of noise up to 800 and even for a amateur like myself,I could go higher without any issues. This camera even shoots video at 1080p. Now to the feature that really make this camera an outstanding value for the money. Fuji developed the new, Honeycomb-Shaped Super BSI Image Sensor. Didn't understand the technology jargon either until I read about it. For you techies, instead of conventional CCD with square pixel arrangements, Fuji's Super BSI has octagonal pixels situated at 45 degree angles. What Fuji claims is that the octagonal profile of the pixels increases sensitivity,improves signal to noise ratios, produces richer , true to life colors and excellent clarity. Although I'm still in the learning stage with this camera, because of all its features, I can say my photos have pop like I've never seen before.I have sampled some images taken with a 14 MP camera and I honestly believe my photos at 10 MP are sharper and the colors are brighter.Just a couple more notes on this camera; definitely use the cd manual as it details all the options this camera has, the macro and super macro settings are exceptional, and on the downside, some features on the camera require you to hold a button and turn a knob at the same time, a bit awkward however, not impossible! This camera sets the new standard for megazoom point and shoots.

And I'm not going to pretend to be one.  This camera is great at taking very nice pictures with minimal fuss.  If all you're interested in is turning the camera on and shooting, this is the camera for you.What I like:1) The zoom is manual, and is easier to set it right where you want then a motorized zoom.  There is no digital zoom, which is just as well.  You can digital zoom on your computer later.  My two other cameras have digital zoom tied to the motorized zoom controller.  I frequently accidentally get into digital zoom mode on those while shooting.  It's a real annoyance.2) The lens is high quality, and I can find no discoloration or distortion anywhere when using it.  But then, a Pro might.3) The screen and viewfinder display high quality images.4) The built in flash works pretty well.  The camera attempts to control the brightness of the flash, and does a decent job.  I have a similar Camera by Canon, and the built in flash is just too over-powering.What I don't like:1) The screen is hard to see outside during the day.  The brightness adjustment helps some, but not enough.2) The viewfinder has no rubber hood, and is also difficult to use out in the Sun.  I've had to use my left hand to shade the Sun, which makes the camera unstable trying to hold and shoot with only one hand.3) The playback button is placed in such a way that it's easy to touch it while shooting and inadvertently switch to playback as you're taking a photo.  But this is happening less and less as my mind learns to avoid it.4) No printed manual.  I hate PDF manuals.My opinion is that this camera really gives a lot of bang for the buck.  You can just set it to auto and take nice photos, or you can tinker with every adjustment to your heart's content.  The real selling point of this camera (IMHO) is the lens.  It does the work of 2 or 3 lenses on a DSLR, and it does it very well.At the top of this page I posted two photos.  They are of a Pelican, one at wide angle and one at full 30X zoom.

Was going to purchase from Amazon, but out of stock.  Purchased from Crutchfield and they didn't haggle me to buy more accessories.I've also used a Nikon 40D and a friend's Canon T1i.  For the features and quality, I personally like the HS10 overall.  Don't get me wrong, I like Nikons and Canons.  I read several of the reviews and think the negative Reviewers are just pissed they overpaid for their camera(s) :)Last week, I took several shots of the bluebonnets with the family.  The pics were crisp and in some aspect the HS10 brought out details that a quick glance wouldn't have noticed.  Zooming in or out the focus was quick and on target.  The movable lcd is nice when shooting macro flowers at odd angles which I had the camera at near ground level.  With the Auto and SR Auto (Scene Recognition) setting, the camera is able to really help beginners with their shots.  Shooting at night when it was practically dark, the pic really came out well.  The street light was several house down and the horizon still had a very small amount of sunlight.  HS10 was able to capture a few stars and the horizon in the shot.Played with the motion plus feature and the motion object has to be moving in the same direction.  If the motion object repeats a former position like turning around, the camera's processor isn't able to stitch the motion object in the pic.Final thought, I would recommend this camera as a primary camera for beginner to advance photographers.

I've owned Panasonic FZ series for the last several years and have been extremely happy with my current FZ35.  My interest was sparked by the introduction of the HS10.  The manual zoom with 24mm-720mm lens range was the draw.  More on both ends of the lens than my FZ35.  Plus the 10mp vs 12mp was a good thing to me (generally less noise with high ISO shots).The camera build and feel is solid.  The lens range is awesome.  However it didn't take me long to realize that this camera was not for me.  There seems to be an inherent issue with auto-focusing (slow, not locking-in). I also noticed inconsistent behavior regarding shutter lag, image noise and artifacts from noise reduction.  I think if one is willing to shoot RAW images (rather than JPG) and do a lot of post-processing, some of the image quality issues could be alleviated.  I'm one that wants JPGs to be great right out of the camera.On paper this camera looks fantastic and I wish it lived up to my expectations.

I've never owned a DSLR but have used them from time to time. I'm the type of person that really enjoys all the technical aspects and full manual control and this camera fits the bill in that sense. I initially started looking at DSLR's but I enjoy taking photos while hiking, fishing, and at sporting events and so on. I just can't justify carrying around a bag of lenses to get the same range as this camera.So far I don't have any big complaints and am generally very pleased with the photo quality. Anything above ISO 800 starts to get a bit noisy but it's not a big deal (you can work around it) as long as you're aware of it. The lens is pretty amazing on this camera and I find myself taking pictures of things I never imagined before.The controls are pretty intuitive and I don't find myself saying \"what were they thinking?\" when adjusting settings. I've read quite a few reviews complaining about the manual focus ring being useless and hard to reach. Personally, I don't find it a problem but maybe I just have small hands. It's only something you use in the rare case the autofocus doesn't pick up properly anyway. For example, I tried taking some relatively close up pictures of a lit compact fluorescent bulb for fun. The autofocus seems to get confused in this case. The manual focus fixes the problem easily though.The other odd complaint I see in a lot of reviews is about the AA battery format. AA battery format was one of my requirements for a camera. I just don't see why I'd want to deal with expensive proprietary Li-ion battery formats when AA Ni-MH gives more than acceptable performance for a fraction of the price. And they're available everywhere. It seems like a no-brainer to me.There are a couple of things to be aware of that sort of surprised me. That's maybe my fault for not researching a little deeper. The impressive burst mode (10fps) is a bit cumbersome to get to and actual continuous fps is pretty slow. I guess I was imagining just being able to take 7 shots rapidly without having to activate the mode. My other complaint is about the RAW software. The ability to shoot in RAW is great but the supplied Silkypix software seems like it's halfway between full and trial versions. It supposedly has the ability to fix chromatic aberrations but this feature seems to be permanently grayed out (among others). I realize the idea is to get me to buy the full version but I'll likely just deal with jpeg out of lazy protest.PROS:-24-720mm (35mm equiv.) lens. And it's fantastic.-Manual barrel twist zoom.-Completely adjustable and manual if you want it to be. Sensible and practical auto and scene settings too.-Tons of neat software tricks and modes. Panoramic images, motion remover, low light modes, 1000fps video, etc. Some of them are a bit gimmicky but still fun.-AA battery format (some would disagree).-Great quality photos with a little practice.-Full HD video if you're into that.-RAW image format.-Threaded 58mm lens takes standard lens hoods, filters, etc.CONS:-Limited Silkypix RAW software.-High burst rate not as useful as it sounds on paper.-Slow continuous shooting speed.-LCD screen resolution is a bit low, but it tilts so it sort of cancels out right?-Auto switch between viewfinder and LCD is sort of irritating sometimes. I would recommend turning this feature off.-There is no printed manual included except for a useless \"getting started\" type deal. You have to get the pdf from the website or the software disc. Why go cheap on the manual for such an expensive product?SUMMARY:As close as you're going to get (for now) to a telephoto DSLR without carrying around a bunch of lenses.

It was well-enough reviewed, but I decided to keep looking. I really wanted a flash hot-shoe and manual zoom ring. These features led me to the Fujifilm S200EXR. It seemed to be \"the one\". Again, it was well-reviewed, but the challenge was to find one from a reputable dealer.While I was looking for one, I came across a mention of the HS10. But everybody knows that 30X lenses are full of compromises, right? Then, I saw a review on The Register's website ([...]), and decided to have a look. When I finished reading, my camera situation had changed. At least on paper, the HS10 appeared to be everything I was looking for, with a whopper lens, at an affordable price.With some reluctance I ordered the HS10, knowing that I could return it and order the S200EXR if I wanted to. I received it about a week and a half after ordering (free shipping), and happily dug into the camera. Two things impressed me immediately: the camera body and controls felt very well done, and of course the lens. Holy cow, what a lens! F5.6 at full zoom, with no barrel distortion that I could tell. And, the manual zoom ring is nice to use. Now, there have been some complaints in reviews about the zoom ring's placement, in relation to the onboard flash. It is true, the flash housing extends about halfway over the zoom ring. However, with a proper camera grip, your non-shooting hand will be supporting the camera body and lens from underneath. Therefore, you can zoom in and out unimpeded. And about the camera's \"feel\", it is much nicer than most entry level DSLR's. The body is glass-reinforced nylon, which feels very solid. And the controls all have a wonderful tactile feel. Trust me, I'm OCD about this. Even the Nikon D90 I played with doesn't have as nice a tactile feel.So far, I've used the camera just about every day since I've received it. So, here are more impressions, both good and bad:* You can't run out of zoom. I haven't encountered a single situation where I thought, \"If I just had a little more...\" However, auto-focus performance isn't great at the long end of the lens. YMMV.* A flash hot-shoe is good, but the HS10 communicates with it at a fairly primitive level. Then again, my flash is quite old, so a modern flash may integrate better than mine does.* The controls are about as logical as they can be. Nothing has stood out to me as being poorly-placed. The level of control over the camera is exceptional; people used to DSLR's will not be underwhelmed, but novices can put it in auto and they won't be overwhelmed.* Connectivity is good, but I hate proprietary USB plugs. What's wrong with Mini USB? And, the supplied cord is staggeringly short. Come on, Fuji, give us a better cord.* AA batteries are good. They're far more useful to me than proprietary batteries, even if they last longer. I don't worry about having to replace an unobtanium battery, and Sanyo Eneloop AA cells work extremely well.* The 3\" display is nice. I understand the Nikon P100 has far higher resolution on its screen, but the HS10's is adequate. Not great, but adequate. The tilt feature is really nice to have, and the screen is useable in bright sunlight, as long as you position it correctly. The viewfinder is reminiscent of one on an old video camera I have, which isn't saying much. An eyecup would be really nice, but every additional doodad would push the cost of the camera up.* The camera's speed is more P&S; than DSLR. I haven't tried all the permutations of auto-focus functionality, but Single AF doesn't seem to be as fast as the competition. And, shot-to-shot times are not great. (Putting the camera into Continuous AF should speed things up, but also drains the batteries faster.) And, manual focus has been pretty much useless so far. Maybe I'm missing something.* The high-speed shooting modes are pretty neat, but somewhat difficult to master. I've gotten amazing results, but far more duds, at least so far. As I get more familiar with everything, the consistency of good shots should increase.* Now, about image quality: So far, I've just shot in JPEG, and have not tried RAW. There is natural artifacting in JPEG, because of the compression. Also understand, a camera can not *improve* a subject, just detract from it. So the goal is to give as exact a representation of the subject as possible. That being said, this camera does well at \"getting out of the way\" of the image. It's focus and exposure have been dead on, for the most part. And the lens has not detracted from image quality, at least that I can tell. I can't discern any distortion or color deviation at any focal length. That's a remarkable achievement for such an ambitious lens. At full image resolution there is a little mottling of detail, but that may be a result of JPEG compression. But, I have taken shots that still show good detail at full size. Again, YMMV.In conclusion, this camera should not be confused with a DSLR in terms of overall image quality. The sensor is very nice, but very small. This, to me, is probably my biggest gripe with the camera. However, to use a larger sensor would dramatically raise the cost of manufacturing, and the end user price. To achieve the same level of zoom (range and quality) with a DSLR body and sensor you would have to purchase a thousand-dollar lens, give or take. So, compromises are inevitable. But I think Fuji has wrung a LOT of performance out of a small sensor, and has succeeded in producing a very capable camera for all but the most demanding users. I am very satisfied, and am looking forward to many years of enjoyment from this camera.", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Birding with the Fuji HS10", "Author": "R. Bailey \"picture me\"", "ReviewID": "R3H2SML3F6O12E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the best bridge camera I have ever used. I use it mostly outside taking nature photos in very difficult circumstances. The camera does very well with focus and provides good images at iso100-800. Iso 800 has a little more noise but can easily be handled. Some complain about the images being a little soft but that is expected with bridge cameras with such high zoom. I sometimes use just a little sharping via external software. Macro functions are easy to use with good exposure and focus. Burst functions are easy to set up and use. The manual focus works well when needed. I am pleased with the video and sound quality. I often take videos at full zoom and should be using my tri-pod more. I always view all photos and videos after downloading to the PC. Image stabilization is very good.  I do use a UV haze filter. Rechargeable batteries last for about 3-4 hours taking about 250 photos and about 5-6 minutes of video and several minutes of image viewing.My big dissapointment is that Fuji did not provide 2x option on the instant zoom and they removed the digital zoom functions altogether. I take most of my photos using the 1.4x instant zoom. The zoom bracking is ok but the 2x enlargement is at 5.1mp. I and several other Fuji customers have had problems with the finepix software recognizing the camera. I had to cycle the camera many times. I no longer use that software. I use my old picture software and download the pictures the 1st time.On the second day of use, all pictures taken had sever pin cusioning. The problem went away. The zoom ring is a little stiff still but getting better with use. I have taken about 3000 pictures in 4 weeks.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "My first week with HS10", "Author": "Nevit Dilmen", "ReviewID": "RSD8EY2Y22T2S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last week since I needed a ultra zoom camera. I rarely upgrade my cameras unless the new has enough good features so that it deserves a new spending. And this camera surely comes with nice features. 30x Long Zoom. 24mm at wide end and 720mm (yes 720) at telephoto end. Super High Speed Movie with up to 1000 frame per second. These are absolutely jaw dropping features, so I had no doubts when buying the camera. After buying the camera I still love it but there are a lot of things that can be improved. I upgraded to latest firmware for camera.* Switching between RAW and jpg shooting is not easy at all. The change has to be made at page 4 of camera settings.* RAW recording is extremely slow. You have no choice but to wait until recording is finished to prepare for next shot.* Fuji's Raw format is supported by very limited number of free and proprietary software providers. The either did not open RAF or had support for other Fuji's but not HS10. The lesson came with many crashes, installs and uninstalls.* Raw software included on CD is not the best you can have. It only converts to JPG no TIF. On my PC all choices for manipulating RAW was locked and I could not find a way to unlock them. Though this is my first week and there might be a choice.* Super High Speed Movie with at 1000 frame per second is done at extremely low resolution of 224x64. Every thing comes at a price. 60 fps at 1280x720, 120 fps at 640x480, 240 fps at 442x332, 480 fps at 224x168* I used 480 fps a lot and there is a dark frame every few frames. This happened even in captures under full sun.* I did not test the video capture feature extensively. But basic use worked fine for me.* Using 4xAA batteries is a plus for me. You can choose Ni-Mh Alkaline and Lithium from camera interface.* I had Sony cameras for about 12 years and I think they are right at movie file format selection. Fuji's choice of Apple Quicktime creates a lot of problems for PC users. Although Quicktime is included in CD I am not happy with installing it and I certainly can not force my friends to install it in order to view my movies. Avi's are good for PC's, Mov is good for Mac and MPG is good for PC, Mac and Linux.* I use exposure compensation and bracketing a lot. Compensation value is not displayed even if the info is displayed. They are a bit hard to access and the settings are forgotten when one restarts the camera.* Bestshot mode allows to capture up to 1.5 second before you fully press the shutter. This proved very handy in sport and bird shooting.* 3\" LCD monitor is great for capturing and viewing. I had no difficulty in using under bright sun.* Manual focus ring has no resemblance in function to old cameras. I tried to use it a couple of times but gave up. It is not well documented in manual.* Face Detection. There is a Face Detection mode in camera but I could not find what it does when a face is detected. My 5 year old small Sony captures when smile is detected. HS10 just shows a green frame around the detected face. I wasn't able to grab the significance.* I tested night shots with tripod setting and had good exposures with the mode.* I could not verify whether Landscape mode focuses on infinity or hyper-focal distance.* White balance modes had all what I needed. They are easy to use.* Deleting multi images is not possible. You have the choices of deleting one by one or deleting all images.* The zoom ring is extremely useful and far superior to electronic motor zooms provided in some cameras.* Automatic viewfinder / monitor change looks for your eye approaching the viewfinder. It is fooled by changes in environmental light. I turned it off since it played tricks on me on sensitive moments. If your monitor suddenly goes black you might need to turn it off either.* Flash has to manually opened to be available. There is no true \"Auto-Flash\" mode* Histogram can not be displayed continuously. You have to press a button and keep pressing it to have histograms.My wish-list* I wish time lapse shooting mode was possible for the periods possible with the battery.* I wish focus bracketing or focus stacking was possible with this camera* I wish infrared or night mode was present.* Automatic dynamic range according to contrast of the scene.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome Fujifilm HS10", "Author": "Carol", "ReviewID": "R1ZD0I4BTPYUT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was deciding between the Fuji HS10 & Panasonic FZ100.

It allows me to fucus inside of a bush to pull out a bird or animal that is inside of the bush. --- Auto focus usually focuses on the near bracnhes and the bird comes out blurry. The 30x manual zoom lens is great, It gives you much better control than a powered zoom lens, Plus the 30x lense lets you get some of the more distant shots and there is no need to change lenses like a SLR camera.

The video is excellent: HD + stereo sound with that so easy to use zoom that goes between wide angle and better than 500mm  telephots with ease, speed and grace. The visual choices before and after shooting also make the HS10 remarkable.  The moving panoramma mode is fun but the time it takes to process between shots is a little frustrating.  Also the left to right direction is by far the most functional mode in this style. Macro is great and the controls make switching between features easy and fast.  The shooting color pallete is rich and lovely.  You'll be pleased and surprized by the quality Fuji has made so easy to get.

Probably the three major advantages to me are the ability to zoom via the zoom ring (rather than buttons), the long zoom range with 24mm (equiv) wide-angle and the ability to shoot RAW format. As far as I could tell image quality should be very acceptable for my uses and the versatility is quite amazing (as it is with most other cameras in its class). The trade-off is a larger and heavier camera than others in its class. This is not necessarily bad as it makes for a very comfortable camera to hold and use.The major issues I have encountered so far are: the small viewfinder image and unshielded viewfinder make the viewfinder very difficult to see and use in bright sunlight, it's minimum aperture of only F8 in all modes except manual and then of only F11, and Fuji's RAW format is not yet recognized by most viewers and photo-editing software.As I become acquainted with my new, DSLR replacement I believe the advantages will offset the less-than satisfactory viewfinder (especially compared to my old DSLR camera) and the limited, minimum apertures.

Let's get some things straight from the off here.  I am by no means a shutterbug or camera enthusiast.  Those looking for technical details best turn to the more \"professional\" reviews here with enough technical specs and comments thereon to keep one fiddling, analysing and otherwise adjusting the camera for days on end before one ever snaps a picture with it.What I wanted from a camera was one that took great pictures and movies, was fun and easy to use to send pictures and movies on the web to friends and family.  This camera - once I spent a few hours fiddling with it - fulfilled all three.Briefly, here is my experience with it:The \"Basic Manual\" that comes with the camera is just that.  For the full Owner's Manual, one has to go to Fujifilm's website and read the PDF file on said site which, by the way, is security protected and cannot be downloaded to your computer. A bit of a pain, this.  Thus, I was a bit worried that the proprietary software one must install to use the camera might present some problems.  Furthermore, anyone thinking about uploading pictures and movies using anything but a USB port will be sorely disappointed. Initially, I tried putting the 4GB memory card into the appropriate slot on my computer - nothing doing.  A quick consult with the Owner's Manual would have saved me the time and informed me that only a USB port would do the trick.  But I was disabused of my fears that one has to stick with the \"FinePix\" software.  Once the files are uploaded using it, they're in your hard drive and can be moved to and viewed or played on Picasa, for example.  The one hitch is that one has to download Quicktime software - which I haven't used in ages - and the movies are all in .mov format.  Sorry, Windows Media Player devotees!  But, again, all this is resolved when the files are transferred to Picasa which, as anybody who has used Picasa knows, vacuums up everything on your harddrive as soon as you open it.The great things about it:1.) The incredibly powerful 30X zoom lens, suitable for amateur astronomers or aspiring voyeurs.(See accompanying video)2.) The picture quality is nothing short of amazing.3.) A camera Luddite such as myself has only to set the camera to \"SRAUTO\" and everything more or less takes care of itself.4.)  It's just a lot of fun!The one not-so-great thing about it if you are taking movies or using the flash a lot:1.) Battery life, or, rather, battery death.  But this, it seems to me, is a small price to pay for all the fun one has.Enjoy the video!", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "GOOD CAMERA", "Author": "john", "ReviewID": "R30ZLRFHPCATFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not a bad camera for a person who has just owned small point and shoot cameras but if you own a dslr I can see some of your gripes with it!

Almost all of the bad ones were my fault (experimenting and learning). I have two other \"point and shoot\" digital cameras (Olympus & Sony) and a very old Olympus OM1 SLR that is \"bullet proof\". That being said, this Fujifilm Finepix HS-10 is a dream come true. It has all of the simplisity of my \"point & shoots\" and the versatility of my SLR without having to change lens all of the time.  I am inpressed with the 24mm wide angel as I take a lot of \"scenery\" shots in the high country of Colorado. Also, the 720mm is impressive for the same reason (suggest a momo or bipod for the long tele shots even with the stabilation built into the camera). I have taken several shots using the macro and super macro and all turned out very clear and good color balance. I am sure that it will take several months to learn all that this camera is capable of, but that's the fun of it. One drawback that I can see is not having a printed manual supplied with the camera. You can find out all you need to know by using the PDF file on the Fujifilm site, but you can't take that to the field with you.I am far from being a professional photographer, but I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants to take really good pictures and isn't affraid to play with the manual controls (that's part of the fun & you can delete your mistakes).It is nicely finished (looks like top quality), very light, and a pleasure to use.

RAW images show considerable distortion if you process them in anything other than the RAW File Converter application that is supposed to be supplied on the CD that comes with the camera, but wasn't. At least it wasn't if you're looking for the Mac version. I had to find and download the thing on my own. While it corrects the lens distortion, in all other respects, it is a mediocre RAW processor. The camera itself is really slow in saving RAW images. Ultimately, I decided to shoot 90% jpegs, and for the 10% RAW images I shoot, I process them initially through Fuji's RAW File Converter into 16 bit TIFFs, saving with the default settings (except maybe White Balance) and open those TIFFs in Adobe Camera Raw prior to running them through Photoshop if necessary.That being said, the camera is reasonably light and sturdy. Auto focus is excellent, which is good, because the manual focus ring is clunky at best. All of the settings you are likely to need quick access to are accessible from buttons on the back or top of the camera. This is really nice. The lens is exceptional (after software correction) for a camera in this or any other price range. The manual zoom is a zillion times better than any motorized zoom out there. Very easy to use. Auto exposure resists the urge to overexpose the highlights as most inexpensive cameras do. This makes the two full auto modes pretty useful. But switching to shutter or aperture priority (or full manual) is trivial. Lens stabilization is just flat unbelievable. Very sharp images even when handheld and zoomed all the way out with decent light. Most of the special features that they push in the advertising and that you don't find on other cameras are pretty clunky and useless, but as a lightweight camera to take on long hikes through difficult terrain (which is mostly what I do) I find this to be an excellent alternative to a DSLR with a bunch of difficult to cary lenses.Overall, I'm finding this a very flexible and easy to use camera for my needs.

If I had a \"do-over\" button, I would not buy it. It's not a terrible camera, but it has fallen considerably short of my expectations. The zoom is very impressive, and it has given me some excellent shots I could not have otherwise gotten. The manual zoom is not particularly smooth, but its feel is adequate and I found I was able to adjust to it.Past that, there's not a lot about the HS10 to recommend it. The internal flash is all but useless. I found very quickly that I needed to add an external flash, and bought a Vivitar 285HV. Since the HS10 does not support TTL, metering is manual. I've found that usually involves at least a couple trial-and-error shots. That's fine for casual situations, but unsuited for many nature photos. As far as features are concerned, the high-speed continuous shooting works well, and I use it frequently. Unfortunately, many of the other advertised \"features\" should more properly be considered as \"gimmicks\". Things like the \"motion remover\", \"multi-motion capture\" and \"motion panorama\" are finicky at best, rarely used and rarely deliver usable photos.I have been a longtime fan of Fuji's upper tier bridge cameras. I didn't necessarily expect the HS10 to compare well against a good DSLR (and it doesn't), but I did expect better results with the HS10 than my old S-model Fuji. Unfortunately, my experience has been that image quality rarely lives up to my older Fuji, particularly in either portrait or challenging lighting situations. I've read a number of other reviews where the owner is thrilled with the camera, so I'll readily concede there may be some operator issues wrapped up in my opinions.

But I am going to return it.The superzoom lens goes from 24mm to 720mm, has a nice manual rubber ring for fine control, and so the camera should be IDEAL for sports and stadium or large auditorium live action shots, right?  WRONG.The single biggest problem with this camera is that there is this HUGE DELAY between the time that you press the \"shoot\" button, and when it actually acquires the photo.  Usually, you can count to 2 seconds before the thing fires off.  You lose the image in the viewfinder during this time, and so if you are trying to track something, you have no way to tell where your subject is located while the camera struggles to take the shot.  I shot lots of poorly framed photos as a result.  I've played with the settings, and tried everything, tried to shut off all sorts of modes that might be slowing it down (e.g., the continuous image stabilization, the continuous autofocus, etc.).  Nothing helps.Then there is the saving of the image files.  Other reviews have mentioned the 5-6 second saves in RAW mode.  Well, even in JPEG only mode, it takes on average about 2 seconds to save (this seems to be faster if the image is brightly lit, for some reason).So, typically, if you are trying to shoot a series of live action shots, there will be a delay of at least 4 seconds between shots.  This makes the camera virtually unusable for anything other than posed portrait shots, or photos of inanimate objects.Now, there is a mode for shooting a series of 6 shots at a rate of 3fps to 10fps.  This works pretty good if you just want to capture a very predictable, easily framed moment in time lasting no more than 2 seconds.  You then have to wait 10 seconds or so afterwards while the photos are saved, so this mode is useless for extended actions.  I did use this mode to take photos of my daughter pole vaulting, an action event which fits the bill.But, what if you just want to shoot shots every 1 or 2 seconds or so continuously, like, when your daughter is walking across the graduation podium to accept her diploma?  At the rate that the Fuji HS10 was capable of shooting, the only way I could guarantee that moment would be captured was with the 1080p video, which is the equivalent of a 2M photo.  The video did not stay focused while tracking during this long distance shot, which was unfortunate.I upgraded my SDHC card to a very expensive Sandisk Class 10 16GB card rated at 30Mb/s.  I should have save my money.  This did nothing for the save speed on this camera.  When I called Fuji tech support to complain about this camera, the guy could only say \"Well that's just the way it's designed\".  He said that the save speed was only 5Mb/sec.  HA!  So much for getting anything more than a Class 4 SDHC card for this camera.The 1080p (1920x1080) video is a nice feature (although the auto-focus does not work very well as you track somebody).  It is one of the many reasons to get this camera.  Other terrific things built into this camera include:  the panorama feature, the rapid shot series, the high ISO 6400 feature (autofocus does struggle at low light), the many photo action modes, the maneuverable LCD (I actually ended up using the viewfinder a lot more - the long zoom shots are much more stable with the camera pressed against your cheek).I like the AA battery aspect of this camera (only Canon and Kodak seems to still use AA batteries on their cameras), as bitter past lessons have taught me that proprietary lithium batteries are never charged or available when you want them.  I use the Sanyo Eneloops, which are the best NiMH batteries ever, and had no problems with battery life (people who posted reviews stating otherwise need to stop using alkaline batteries, which drain RAPIDLY on digicams, and use these Eneloops instead - other NimH batteries just don't compare to these).But ultimately, despite all the bells and whistles, when I looked back upon this extensive 20 day experience travelling and shooting away with this camera (took it to Stockholm, Reno, Houston, and Los Angeles, taking hundreds of photos and videos), the most frustrating aspect of using this camera was the SLOW CYCLE TIMES.  Electronics are supposedly getting FASTER all the time.  Slow cycle times were a huge complaint with the older digicams, so we should not have to revisit this unpleasant aspect of digicam history.My old Sony DSC-W7 shoots faster than this brick!  Seriously, this little Sony camera has a cycle rate of between 1.5 and 2 seconds between shots, which is 2-3 times better than the Fuji HS10, and the 7M photos it puts out are terrific.  The Fuji HS10 is also slower than the Fuji S2000, which I had reviewed earlier.I suspect that Fuji made a commercial decision to scrimp on putting in faster electronics for this camera, in order to keep it at a certain price point.  And the upgrade to the larger Megapixels (a sexy selling point - whereas taking photos really fast is not a sexy selling point), plus the addition of the many \"auto\" features without faster electronics was what slowed this camera down, compared to older superzoom cameras in its line, such as the Fuji S2000.  The 5 Mb/sec save speed does not begin to compare with the 14 Mb/sec save speed of the Nikon Coolpix P100.  The P100 also has a 2.5 fps continuous mode at full 10M size which can run for 37 shots (67 continuous shots at 2.5 fps if the photos are scaled back to 5M).In summary, although the camera has a lot of terrific features, it is just too slow for the most common things that I want to use it for, which is to take sequential spontaneous pictures of people at long distance (e.g., sports photography, special event photography in a stadium/auditorium, general tourist street photography).  I could use a lot fewer megapixels on a superzoom camera;  I can't deal with a slow camera.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Bridge Camera with a DSLR Feel !", "Author": "Emil \"Emil\"", "ReviewID": "R2S1J78M35B2CK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "### Update: 13 SEP 2010 ###- Adobe Camera Raw offers support for HS10 RAW files- Only major \"negative\": no hot-shoe for external TTL Flashes, say Nikon SBs- Fujifilm Website finally allows online registration ###A very good non-DSLR camera !***LIKES***- I upgraded the firmware, as advised, loaded a class 10 Sandisk card, and tested the camera shooting nature (foliage, flowers) and landscapes in a hilly region.

I would have waited longer, but my old Canon power shot broke.  By the way, I absolutely love the manual zoom.  The manual zoom is much faster and easier to control.  My auto zoom broke on my previous Canon power shot, and it was not worth fixing for the price of repair.

Thus far, I have been able to take advantage of some of its features, and am rather pleased with the product. The main drawbacks rest in its user interface.Generally speaking, the controls are not very intuitive. This is coming from someone who has used primarily point-and-shoot cameras (Canon PowerShot SD890IS 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom). Those cameras are very intuitive and provide a pretty reasonable interface for a number of key functions. The FinePix has more functions, to be sure, and the way they are laid out is somewhat cumbersome.Specifically, I have attempted to experiment with depth of field and have been rather unsuccessful. There are ways to adjust aperture and shutter speed on this camera, but this amateur has not been able to master these functions in at least a dozen uses. I have resorted to using automatic settings and manipulating depth of field through other means--not an expert technique, but it gets the job done.With that being said, the automatic settings allow for a much higher quality on the FinePix than point-and-shoot cameras, and, when I have been able to attain the effects I wanted, the outcome has been great.Other quirks with this camera include a PDF-only instruction manual (saves trees, but it would be handy to have in the field), and the use of AA batteries (for someone used to the simple plug in power supply of a point-and-shoot, this is fairly burdensome).Otherwise, this is great piece of equipment, and I look forward to learning more about its powerful functions.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A 5-Stars Bridge Camera", "Author": "E. Lan \"EL\"", "ReviewID": "R3NXQ345GSMP4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for a month now. I think it's about time to share my review about it.I was looking for a bridge camera for a while after a recent trip to Disney World. With my old Nikon gears (D70+17-55mm+70-210mm+30mm...etc), bags, 2 toddlers, car-seats, stroller, I told myself not to do that again. I order this HS10 from Amazon, and received it within a week. I updated the firmware Ver.1.02 right away and have been using this camera pretty much everyday from then on. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:* 30X optical zoom: I can shot something that I was not able to. I screw in my Sony VCL-DH1758 Tele Conversion Lens try shooting moon with handheld just for fun. I got a great detail on it.* AA batteries: I use 4 x Sanyo Eveloop batteries with more than 500 shots. No need to get rip-off proprietary battery and no need to risk on those cheap 3rd party batteries from EBay.* Flash hot-shoe: I can use my Nikon SB-800 on it. No TTL, but for bouncing light, it works pretty well.* 3\" tilting LCD: it's beautiful and very easy to use it. It's hard to see in on the bright sunny day, but you can use EVF when you cannot see clear on the 3\" LCD screen. Some complaint about the EVF resolution is very poor, but it didn't bother me. I mainly use it to compose pictures, not viewing.* Pictures quality: This is the most controversial topic and has been discussed thousands time in DPreview forum. I found many people compare it to DSLR while we all know this one only has sensor size as little as regular P&S; camera. For color, I LOVE the color. It looks so natural on the skin tone and very accurate out from AWB. Even indoor shots the color looks very nice. For the sharpness, I have to agree with most users. It's a little soft most of time. If you are a DSLR user and too use to sharp images, you will find HS10 disappointing.* Filter thread (58mm): Yes, so if you have any filters from your DSLR, you can use it. I especially like that I can use my Sony tele-convertor lens on it.Cons:* Slow shot-to-shot speed: Overall the speed is slow. I lower the resolution to 5MB on JPEG and seem to be acceptable. It is slow, but most P&S; camera are slow too.* Barrel distortions: I found it very obvious on the wide angle. The proportions of people on the edge are distorted badly.* No lens hood: I found the lens hood is an optional item that cost another $13.00+shipping from Fuji's web site.* Useless advanced modes: They never work the way they claim they should. Motion remover, Panorama, multi-motion capture..., none of them works.* Price: The price dropped about $30 after the day I purchased. I agreed with others that it is a little over-priced, but I got a CitiCard deal to save $100 on this camera.Overall I like this HS10 and would give it 5 stars as a great bridge camera. Yes, it is a 5-Stars \"Bridge\" camera. It will not replace your DSLR and the size is not as small as your pocket P&S; camera. There's no camera that can do-it-all. Photographer is no other than chef, painters...etc. I never see a chef with only one knife nor a painter with only one brush. You need to know your tool well to fully utilize it. I don't mind keeping it because I know what it can do and what it cannot. There's a trend that Camera manufacturers start putting bigger senor into P&S; camera (Olympus PEN, Sony NEX...etc). If you have no immediate need of a bridge camera, I think wait a little longer, we will see P&S; cameras with mega-zoom and DSLR sensor on them.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Dipo", "ReviewID": "R1P3N6RVNI1TJ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The things I like about it are:- It has a 30X zoom lens with manual controls and lens stabilization (anti -shake)- It uses regular (or rechargeable) AA batteries.

The IQ tradeoff for a 30x zoom range is evident in this camera.  The .jpg images at all ISO's are full of noise and lack clarity when compared to other cameras in this range.  The resoluton reminds me of a 5mp camera of 3-5 years ago.  What is strange even at base ISO is there is plenty of noise left along with evidence of massive noise reduction as well.  The well know water color affect as it's known.  Of course with PP and/or RAW some of this can be mitigated but the lack of pure resoluton cannot be forgiven.  The lighting conditions for my outside tests was very good and I used indoor lighting for low light testing.  So any negative results I don't believe were cause by less than adequate lighting conditions.When compared to other cameras in this class the auto focus was accurate but of average speed in good light and actually quite slow in low light.  And of course it slowed even more at maximum zoom.  There also seemed to have a little more shutter lag than I'm used to when the image stabiliztion was set on #2 for shutter IS only.  The lag improved a little while in #1 IS, continuous, but the lag was still not nearly as crisp/quick as say a Panasonic FZ35 or super quick s100fs.  For a camera of this price range and at this developement stage in cameras I found this shutter lag to be quite lacking.  Maybe the sensor based IS over lens IS was the cause of this, I don't know but it was disconcerning.I did find the metering to be rather consistent and the white balance accurate.  I did not try all the Fuji color modes and many fuctions as it became evident early on I had no intention of keeping this camera.The video in 1920x1080 HD was jerky at times and wavy in others.  However the resolution and colors were great.  Lowering down to the 1280x720 fixed the problems of 1080 HD.  I was using an Adata class 6 Turbo series with a 22mb/s read and 10mb/s write. Maybe this isn't fast enough for the full 1080 HD.I found the build quality to be excellent and the zoom tight and responsive.  The zoom ring was a little stiff but that's normal for a new camera.  Actually much better this way than too loose when new.  And of course the zoom range is magnificent but for this 30x range the IQ has suffered.  The IQ also appeared to be better at the long end.Overall this is an average camera with below averge IQ and above average zoom capabilites.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  But, alas I returned for a refund after using for 3 days.  The other cameras I used as comparison for testing were the Canon SX10 IS and the Panasonic FZ35.  I also own a Fuji s100fs but it's so far ahead of the HS10 it's not worth mentioning.I encourage everyone to view foilage and trees in all pictures at 100% to really see the lack of resolution and the amount of noise smearing being used. Even if you don't normally view or print that large it's imperative to view these to see what I'm seeing and others as well. A quality $500 camera should not show this amount of watercolor affect at ISO 100-200.  Just viewing downsized images and then believing everything is fine is not telling the whole story.Added 4-12-10 from my comments section:1:  To put it short and sweet the s100fs has more resolution, focuses faster, less shutter lag and processes the files much faster than the HS10. The optics are just better on the s100fs as well. With the s100fs you can take pictures one right after the other in RAW normal shooting mode, whereas there is always a lag write time of 4-5 seconds for every shot in the HS10. Since I only shoot RAW and sometimes require quick refocusing and shooting this time delay from the HS10 was one of the deal breakers. The amount of chroma noise in the HS10 shots is also atrocious. Sure on the well exposed shots you have to view it at 100% to see it but it's there in abundance. The firmware has tried very hard to remove the noise and actually created the smearing look called watercolor. Look at the foilage and trees of any shot at 100% and mostly it's just a smeared blob.Even the best shots from the HS10 don't have the crispy punch like the average s100fs ones do. I'm sure in due time many will compose side by side examples with all types but from my 27 years Photography experience and owning over 50 digital cameras in the last 9 years it doesn't take me long to decide on a camera.Bottom line when a camera has poor resoluton, is slow processing and slow functioning I don't want it.2:  Look at any or all photos at 100% to really examine. Some call this pixel peeping but that's what I require. Most of the ones on DPR are downsized 1-2mp pics. The ones which are full sized the noise, attempted noise removal and lack of resolution are readily apparent. If you can't see it you're not looking. Any $200 camera can make a nice 8x10 downsized image and that's what most people are looking at and say WOW those are great. I expect a $500 camera to expose a relatively noise free and high resolution pic at base ISO and viewed at 100%. Otherwise it's useless to me.kd", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could have been a contender", "Author": "Robert J.

Unfortunately, the camera didn't live up to all the hype. The camera has some good qualities such as a great 30X zoom lens, that's the equivalent  24-720mm on a DSLR! The camera also has a great burst shooting rate of 10 frames per second. For snapshot the camera gives good results. The many shooting modes offer the average user many options to acquire reasonably good photos in most shooting situations. But if you're looking to have those images enlarged, expect some noise as well as somewhat soft focus on most images. I just wasn't happy with the overall image quality in most all of the settings. Then there was the problem of focusing on subjects where the contrast between the main subject and objects behind or in front is low. The camera was unable to focus on the main subject in this situation almost every time. I had to switch to manual focus in these situations and that in itself is a problem because manual focus is not just a straght forward operation. There is a focus box that is supposed to magnify the center of the image for easier focusing. It's a joke. It makes the image almost impossible to figure out. I turned it off and tried to use the focus bar, which is almost as useless. Worse still is the lens's focus ring is a tiny ribbed ring of about a quarter of an inch in thickness and butted right up against the camera body. Not very ergonomic.  There are other major problems. The shot to shot time is very slow. Unless you are using the burst mode the average shot to shot time I experienced in RAW file format was about 2-3 seconds. In Jpeg it was a bit faster, bit slow enough to cause me to miss what I was trying to capture. As for the 1080P HD movie quality, Not too bad.The stereo sound is ok, but I wish there was a jack for an external mike. The shake reduction causes the video to be jumpy and I turned it off. The focus seems to roam somewhat. But the bottom line is image quality, and there in lies the rub. The image quality is nowhere near the quality of even the most modest DSLR's and with a nearly $500.00 price tag, I'd expect more.

McCaffrey \"sumofan\"", "ReviewID": "R1VIB38GKSGGP9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought my Fuji Finepix HS10 less than a week ago while on a trip to Vegas. I added a few filters (UV and a circular polarizer). When initially testing shots, they were very clear, all the way through the fully extended 720 mm. After adding the filters, I was having an impossible time getting anything but muddled shots at the fully extended range, though it worked fine when bringing the lens back to around 500 mm. No matter what settings I tried, hand held nor tripod mounted, I could NOT get anything but junk at 720 mm. I was in very close contact with FUJI support on this, and they were very responsive, suggesting alternative settings, etc.  Nothing worked. I then thought about the additional filters and could THAT be the cause of the problem. I took off both the UV and circular polarizer ... PROBLEM TOTALLY SOLVED! I had beautiful/clear pics at 720 mm, and hand held was no problem whatsoever. I then added the UV filter (BOWER), still clear as a bell. Adding the circular polarizer (BOWER) brought the problem back immediately. Turning the cp filter had no effect, still lousy ... really lousy ... results at 720 mm. Those of us who bought this thing wanted that 30X range, and not having it caused me intense frustration at first. I have read the reviews here, and apparently more than one person has gone through this. TAKE THE CP FILTER OFF! That should bring you the camera you thought you were buying in the first place.Now: the BRAND of CP FILTER might also be the culprit here, I don't know. Perhaps a better grade cp filter might be the answer if you want to employ a cp filter ...I did not rate the various sub-categories here since I have not used the camera enough to comment with any experience. The same applies to my giving the camera a four, not five, star rating ... not enough use.

It is a relatively new model, and has all the \"bells and whistles\" in this $400 range. It does take beautiful shots (I've mostly used for pet pix so far). I got it for the extreme zoom (24-720mm equivalent to 135 cameras), back-lit CMOS sensor, and complete manual control, as well as many auto-assist modes. Another consideration was the hot-shoe for external flash - something not many cameras at this price have, which allows me to use a 30-year thyristor flash which still works quite well (plus the ability for slave units if I want). While none of my old film lenses are still usable these days, it's nice to know I can still re-use something...  I already had an HD camcorder (Sony) for video, but it was very limited in what it could do for stills (4 MPixel and all auto - very little control). Plus, this one does 1080p video (the Sony is over 3 years old and only does 1080i). In sum, it has so many features (Panormama, 7-10 fps burst mode, great mix of auto/manual modes, huge zoom, jpg & raw, etc)that for under $400 it was a no-brainer.

DVPS - It also has a nice heft and feel, and it looks real cool too...Pros: No camera (especially in this price range) does eveything perfectly, but the HS10 does more things better than anything else I could find after months of searching websites and reviews.

The jpg is below average for outdoor and is very below average for indoor; its jpg processing adds a lot of noise!!! I took the indoor pictures with windows open in day light and with flash on. All jpg pictures are soft (very soft). It should not happen to a company with so much experience in camera. It is like a Ferrari car with a bad driver. However, its macro mode is excellent. When zooming to max. (even to a small object), the result is above average too. My Samsung drops its IQ a lot when it zooms to its optical max.I contacted Fujifilm and they told me that Samsung camera is able to set ISO down to 50 for my pictures and with less exposure time comparing with the same pictures I took with HS10. Since HS10 used longer exposure time, my hands were not steady enough to prevent shaking. This is why all my indoor pictures are soft. Samsung i6 has a slightly bigger sensor too. Usually, only the expensive cameras use bigger sensor.He told me to use the \"P\" mode and adjust the focus and sharpness. I experimented a few settings and now the pictures IQ are closer to the Samsung (still has more noise than Samsung). Here is my setting:= Mode: P= ISO: 100 (I wish I can set it to 50)= Sharpness: Hard= Tone: Soft (it reduces half of the noise)= Color: Hard (color is too light even at \"hard\", need to change white balance)= WB Fine Tune: +1 (R) , +2 (B)= When zooming to far object, I always set it to macro mode (not super macro)= Focus: Center. Always focus subject at center of the frame, press half of the button, compose the picture, then press the button fully.= Face detection: It works most of the time, but not all the time. I prefer not to use this feature. I use the above technique to focus a person's face before composing the picture.It means that I can't use most of the features on this camera (like the auto, SRauto, SP1, SP2, and adv) with good result for now.But I still decided to keep HS10 because of the following reasons:0) Use AA battery! No more special charger! But I do have a 15 minutes quick charger for my 2000mAh NiMH AA batteries. I will carry one extra set with me all the time. If I don't buy HS10, I would buy Canon SX20IS, it uses AA batteries too with hot shoes.1) To get a manual zoom len with this wide angle and zoom range, I need to pay for a real DSLR camera. And I need to carry two or three lens!! Too cumbersome for me now.2) It would cost much more to do item 1 above. Not wise to do at this economy with less job security.3) Once I tried the HS10 manual zoom len, I fell in love with it. It brings me back my old memory before the invention of digital camera. I used to own the 35mm cameras with manual zoom lens many years ago. It is harder to do a smooth zoom with video, but I don't take video that much with a camera.4) The pictures IQ with the above \"P\" mode setting are \"closer\" to my Samsung i6 now. HS10 still has more noise but I can reduce it with software, printer, or printer driver. Also hope the future firmware can \"fix\" it.5) Raw pictures are very nice if you don't mind the 15MB size.6) Write time is fast now for jpg pictures after I do the following:  - turned off red eye removal  - say \"No\" to all save org. image items  - say \"No\" to Image display option  - only take 2 to 4 mega pixel pictures. I only print 4x6 pictures, I don't need more than 2 mega pixel. 4+ mega pixel picture is just wasting disk space and take more time to write.  - also using a class 10 SDHC card (only $19.95 from Amazon with 5 items gift!)7) Hot shoe! There are not many cameras in this price range with hot shoe. It is needed for taking group pictures! And I don't like those slave flash, they don't always work.Someone said the \"raw+jpg\" mode gives better JPG pictures, but it is taking too long to write 15MB raw files and I hate to waste space.I am also using the \"Zeikos ZE-FLK58 58mm Multi-Coated 3 Piece Filter Kit (UV-CPL-FLD)\" with HS10. Only $7.99 from Amazon !! All glasses. I don't see any difference in picture IQ when using the UV filter. No issue with focusing too. This is important to protect the big zoom lens. The CPL filter also works well.Now I just need an external flash for this camera. Any good suggestion to match this camera ?Thanks for those who replied me in the comment page.

It was at that time that I fell in love with the Nikon brand and learned about how they finely grind their lenses for greater clarity even if you enlarge your photos to poster size...where other cameras would fail. Since then, I have never carried any other brand and said I never would.I was able to try out this camera from Amazon's Vine program so I will start by saying I would have never picked it or tried it any other way. I will put myself down by saying I was very much a camera snob, without realizing it...stuck on one brand.At first my bias was evident. Used to Nikon cameras I was not happy that I didn't immediately know how to work this one and there was no manual to help me. In all honesty, that's still a negative for me. It's not that it's hard to use by any means...even someone who never used a camera before will figure it out...but knowing how to navigate it really would be faster if a manual CAME with it.  I printed out the manual and it took up a notebook binder. Kind of bizarre but it also does a lot. Much of the information you may never need.The first thing I was impressed with was how lightweight is was. Half the weight of my other cameras and when I travel that really is a BIG bonus.But that doesn't matter if all you do with it doesn't come out wonderful. I have been using the camera a month now non-stop prior to writing my review of it. I am amazed that it came with a lens that can focus so well upclose without it being an \"upgrade lens\" which I've always had to do with my Nikons.  There is a bird's nest that is above my stereo speaker on my porch. I knew there were baby birds in it because I could look down through the slats from my upstairs porch but I really couldn't see them well. I also didn't want to get close to the nest and scare the mamma bird...so I stood in my back doorway, probably 12 feet from this nest, and I took a close up of not only the nest, but the babies too. And I mean so close up that I can see the insides of their mouths and every tiny feather. What I couldn't see at all with my naked eye no matter how I tried, was pretty amazing when I pulled that photo up on my computer screen (I will repost the photo here shortly).Here's why:It automatically \"read\" that I was focusing on the nest, and just as a professional would do if they manaully adjusted the f-stop, the background behind it was softer. A 7 year old child, therefore, could snap a photo and take some amazingly professional shots with this---automaticaly. The baby birds were sharp and clear...I gag when I say this but I kinda think it turned out better than with my top-of-the-line Nikon. And this is WAY cheaper. I don't WANT to like it more. But I swear to you my photos were crisp and clear and with perfect lighting and focus.True test: I have a one of the professional photo printers that prints out poster size prints. This is when you see the clarity, any fuzz, etc.It rocked...sharp, clear images. I was shocked. Great lens, great focus.The video was equally as easy to use and turned out with excellent clarity and I own both the Mino and the the Ultra camcorders to compare it to (my reviews of those are on Amazon.)  To now be able to combine both video and still images on this camera when I couldn't before just made me fall in love. If you compare this to the top hand-held camcorders it's almost like you are buying a camera and getting the camcorder free. It not only has stereo sound rather than mono--most of them have mono--but it also, much to my surprise has 3x image stabilization which some of the top models don't have...so it automatically makes your videos less shaky, more professional.Do I think it should come with a manual so that you don't have to print one out? Heck yes. At least of some basics. Is it simple for anyone once you glance over the main points of the manual? Yes.But that's not as important as what you wind up with. I am sorry Nikon, but I keep grabbing this one. Lighter, incredible results, great zoom, simple, with a camcorder. Dreamworthy. And it even seemed better in low light and comes with a greater zoom lens that adjusts automatically from regular to mega zoom.

The autofocus feature while recording video is very quiet and does a great job of staying in focus, in pretty much any situation that we found.The worst part of this camera is the manual focus capability, or lack thereof. All of the complaints are correct, regarding the focus ring. It is garbage. Also, the manual focus capability in general seems to not even work, so I gave up on even trying.The AS (Anti Shake) features are sub-par to the T2i. I have tried every setting available and have not yet found an AS setting that actually works. In fact, the camera is so sensitive at times, that even the steadiest hand takes a few blurry photos.The HS10 photo quality is pretty good, in general. However, it falls far behind the Canon T2i.The HS10 lens is the second-best, non-removable lens that I have used. The old S9000 had a much better lens, but the HS10 lens zoom capability is the best on any camera out of the box. The HS10 lens quality in general is inferior to the old S9000. The engineering on the HS10 lens is so tight, that zooming in a smooth motion is impossible.The feature pack built into this camera is fantastic, for the novice to mid user level.If you buy this camera, I recommend tinkering with it for a couple weeks before judging it.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "What an amazing Camera with a poor printed maual.

I have never seen this setup in my previous 10 or so digital cameras.It will take some time to find all the features if your a novice as I am.

I had been using film all along when the digital revolution invaded my space. Since my bread and butter was in the words, and mags and papers often hired separate fotogs to take the pics, I was not about to spend 4-6 grand on a digital SLR camera, I stuck with my film SLR.I was on the hunt to get a smaller lightweight rig that could supplement my main camera and upon much research, fell into this camera.First off, I read where fotogs whose living depend on their pictures were in love with \"the little camera that could.\" The non-detachable lens will reach out to an amazing translated 300mm zoom, it's quite impressive. Lenses zoom that far out will usually lose a tremendous amount of light, somehow Fuji makes this work and it takes terrific pics even at great focal lengths. And they won an international award for the lens design to prove it's righteous.The body of the camera looks and feel very much like a slightly scaled down SLR rig so owners of those won't feel any different. The camera's flash is useful only indoors or at closer ranges outdoor to fill in areas. It will NOT compete with the separate hot shoe flashes designed for SLR rigs. There are several program modes and the aperture, white balance, shutter speed and a host of other adjustments can be made to give the desired result or effect.The camera being digital has a mode where you can see the exact settings for a particular shot, or all of them if you so choose. It makes the Fujifilm a great teaching tool. I learned more from the camera itself than I could've in a class room. Best bet for newcomers or those not wanting to experimenting is to leave the rig on \"P\" for program and let the camera decide the settings. You can't go wrong with that.My only gripes as a motorcycle race journalist are shutter speed, and reset times. The camera will get a decent action shot but the time it takes the batteries to capture, process and save the picture, the next rider has flown past me. A higher quality SD card I'm told would help quite a bit but it still will never take rapid shots like a true SLR camera. It can be compensated for to a degree but compared to an SLR is is slow in that sense. All of the Pro reviews I read they said the same Im saying to you, it is THE top of the line \"point and shoot camera.\"  An 800 lb gorilla of a point and shoot, or a point and shoot on steroids if you will.All of the Pro photographers who chose thing thing use it for simpler shots, or when they want a lightweight alternative to bulky lenses and heavy equipment.Ive attached some picture to give you an idea of what you cam do with this amazing little camera.

Somehow this camera works nicely as an alternative to both of my other options; I tend to chose depending on the occasion.  This camera is as large as my Canon, which means it is too large to fit easily in a purse (and certainly not a pocket), but it is much lighter.  On a trip to Chicago, I brought my Canon, equipped with only a 50mm fixed lens.  After a day of sight-seeing, my shoulders and neck were tired and sore from lugging it about.  The Fujifilm, however, is very light, especially given the excellent zoom lens it comes with.  I have toted this about all day, and its weight is ideal.Besides its weight, the zoom lens IS the feature to recommend this camera.  This is the best built in zoom lens I've used, and it's ideal for a parent with a couple kids.  This is the camera I bring to soccer games and performances to catch my kids up close and personal from far away.  The built in video recorder is a bonus (which my Canon doesn't have) for these moments as well.I also loaned this camera to my stepmother for a trip she took to the Canadian National Parks, and she brought back some beautiful images taken with this camera.  They enlarged wonderfully, as she made a calendar with some of the shoots upon her return.  She reported that she found it easy to use and loved its versatility.  I would second its ease of use.  I've been a canon user for years, and I was afraid I would have difficulty adjusting to a different menu system, but I found this camera's menu and buttons to be intuitive and self-explanatory.Minor complaint:  It burns through batteries.  Now, it does use double AA's, which can be very handy, especially when traveling, but they don't last long.  My stepmother voiced this as her main complaint.  Buying rechargeables will help, but they probably won't last more than a day of shooting, if that (this is in contrast to my Canon rechargeable that lasts for a few days of heavy shooting, and weeks of light use before needing a charge).If you are looking for a lightweight, versatile camera, with a good zoom lens, and you want lots of auto-shooting modes, this should be a contender.

The quality of the images was very disappointing.  Over the 3 weeks or so that I kept the camera I took lots of nature photographs, and some indoor and low light ones.  The pictures all seemed to look pretty decent on the back preview panel but when I downloaded them onto my computer and took a closer look, they just weren't very good.Finally yesterday I decided to do a comparison test.  I have an old Sony Cybershot DSC W1 which is a 5 mega pixel compact camera I bought in 2004.  I set up a tripod and took a series of shots with both cameras of the same scenes at the wide angle setting (the area captured is almost the same for both cameras at this scale). When I zoomed in on the resulting jpg's over and over the 5 MP Sony was giving me a sharper more detailed image compared to the 10 MP Fuji HS10.  I tried all kinds of setting adjustments. The HS10 came close to but never topped the 6 yr old Sony with half the MP resolution.That finally did it. I just couldn't convince myself to keep the camera.  Which is really disappointing because I loved everything else about this camera.A note: I never tested saving the photos in RAW format.  It may do a better job in RAW but I'm really not one to want to deal with post processing RAW into jpgs.So to conclude, the camera has a great layout, an amazing zoom lens but isn't able to take the quality of photos you'd expect for the price you are paying.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Proprietary raw", "Author": "rblaw", "ReviewID": "RWJ9IM377CM3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "One of the touted big features of the camera is its ability to do photos in the raw format. It can produce raw files, but they can only be used and edited with the clunky program that comes with the camera. None of the Adobe programs recognize the raw files. The Fuji program was nasty to install (numerous error messages). Every time I fired it up, there were two error messages saying it could not connect to the internet to look for upgrades; despite there always being a strong Internet connection. The program wanted to fire up every time I connected anything to the computer. I finally removed it and had to do a system restore because of things it messed up. If Adobe comes up with a plug-in for the raw files, I am not sure I will use the raw because the camera takes about 5 seconds to store each raw photo.Apart from the raw problems, it is quite a nifty gadget. The manual is only available as a PDF file on a CD. If you want to learn all the nifty features, I recommend printing out the manual.

I used the camera with flash to take a picture and it was wonderful, the color was good the lighting was good, no red eye. I just briefly tried the movie setting and it takes a decent movie but I still prefer my regular movie camera for that. The panoramic pictures works great and is easy to use. Closeup pictures of flowers and things (macro) turn out nearly flawless.There are a lot of buttons and dials on this which can be confusing especially since they don't give a regular manual. This is one big flaw that loses a star. For the price of this camera it should have a large manual instead of the poor starter version and then having to refer to the computer for questions. I find this time consuming and frustrating than to have a written manual. This camera has many functions, some I haven't figured out yet and the manual should be printed simply to make it easier to refer to.The lag time between pictures is much too long and this in itself greatly disappoints me. A camera of this quality should take much quicker pictures. I have an old kodak easy share that can be forced to take quicker focused pictures than this camera.I would recommend a good quality rechargeable AA batteries or lithium for this camera. The battery usage isn't too bad but the lithium will be more dependable and last longer.Overall the quality of pictures is very good, if you don't mind the lag time between the pictures then I would recommend this camera, otherwise it might be better to look around a little more.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "What a dog of a camera!", "Author": "Yogi Moore \"YogiM\"", "ReviewID": "R1FXW7MIK9KLEY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I preordered this months before its release - tons of PR yet no sample images until the last minute.

Faidley", "ReviewID": "R1K71VJU8IH8C3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At first glance, this camera appears to be a really revolutionary device. But take it from a 25 year professional, avoid this camera (and all the initial hype) if you have even a small amount of photographic experience and want to use the HS10 for serious photography.I only tested this camera for a few hours and then returned it.Here are the two deal breakers for me:1: Manual focus ring is a joke and is worthless. Not only is it difficult to use because its only about 1/4 of an inch wide, but it is jammed right next to the body so turning it is very difficult. In addition, it is all but impossible to tell when you are focused, and it can take more than 360 degrees of turning to even come close to what looks like a focused frame. There are times when manual focus is very important.2: The camera's internal processor which controls the buffering speed (time between the ability to shoot another picture) is very slow. This is OK for most photographers who do not need to shoot really quick sequences. In RAW setting, there is a 3-5 second delay, which makes the camera useless. If you want to shoot in JPEG mode (a lessor quality format), there is a one second delay, which is not bad. I should note that some inexperienced users will counter by saying the HS10 has a 3-10 frames per second setting. Yes! HOWEVER.... a closer examination shows the \"burst\" settings are temporary. In other words, they cannot be programed in a fixed \"Programed\" mode that stays as a setting when the camera is turned on or off. Fuji did this of course, because of the silly processor. Therefore, you must be a fortune teller and know exactly when something really neat is about to happen, so you can take the multiple steps necessary to set the faster shooting. Oh... by the way... the processing time for those multiple frames is crazy, about 10-20 seconds before you can use the camera for more shots! I should note this processing time is a factor of the camera's internal processor, not settings or the card you are using. My camera was tested with a Ridata Lightning Series, 16 GB, Class 6 SDHC card. Others have reported the same delay with lower and higher class cards. Please see other forums on the Internet so you don't take my word alone.I have yet to test the HD video option as the camera does not come with a HDMI cable. This is annoying for those who might buy the camera for a trip only to find no cable to download their footage to a computer.I have returned my camera, in part because of the serious design flaws, and secondly, to show Fuji that consumers do not like it when they skimp on features that should be included with modern cameras. After all, Fuji has made other cameras with great processors, like their S Pro series, so they have the technology.My suggestion is to wait. I'm sure another company will release a similar camera without the goofy flaws this camera has.W.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not up to expectations.", "Author": "J. L.

I remember reading about the Casio cameras a few years back that had this feature, but were $500-600.  I started looking again recently, and still noticed that even used these cameras were $300 an up.  I've had a Canon S2 IS for the past 8 years (bought new) and really enjoyed that camera.  Loved the zoom (12x) on it and the fact that you could take pictures while you were shooting videos.  This was pretty cool back in 2004!  Anyway, about 2 months ago I began searching on google for \"1,000fps cameras\" and came across this beast.  I read the reviews, noticed it was 2 years old but saw the price tag at $499.  Well, I started searching eBay and noticed that they were going for $150-200 used.  I got one 3 weeks ago for $130 off of eBay. I've had it about 2 weeks.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!  AMAZING!!!  For the money I spent, I am more than satisfied! I would have been happy if I spent $400 new on this camera in the store.  I've been practicing taking \"moon\" shots, and while they don't looks as good as others in an HS10 forum, they are getting there!!  I LOVE the manual zoom ring.  I've read where some people have had trouble zooming in, feeling it was too \"stiff\".  I love it!  I've actually had way more fun taking pictures with this thing that the original reason I bought it...for the slow motion video!!  I love the slow motion video, but really haven't had too many cool things to capture on slow motion.  One thing is for sure, the 1000fps is very tiny (225x66?) and unless you are out in the sunlight its pretty useless.  I've been trying to convert the videos to see if I could clean up the quality, but when you make an image that was originally 225x66, full screen, it just isn't going to be pretty.  I would like to do a water balloon pop to see the water hold the balloon shape with it, but certainly the 1000fps is not going to look like the slow motion you see on tv.  The 480fps is better, but still needs to be in good light.  I prefer the 240FPS so far for capturing my daughter at volleyball practice...what happens, however, is that the light frequency is broken down too so you get a flicker...which I'm pretty sure is just science!  So, if you are like me and are buying this STRICTLY for the slow motion, 240fps is really the only usable resolution they provide.  Which I believe is the same as the HS20/HS30 (newer models)...which still doesn't upset me, because of the price I paid for the camera!!  The 1080p is choppy...but I noticed its because of my computer, not the camera...I have an i32120 processor, but just an on board video card...need to get that upgraded...the 1080p when viewed on the camera is probably not the same quality as some of the newer cameras.  My wife has a Nikon s6330 and the video is noticeably higher quality on her camera than it is my HS10.PROS - ZOOM, ZOOM, ZOOM...SLOW MOTION VIDEO!!!!

Eisenberg \"Keeping it real since 1959\"", "ReviewID": "R2FTWMPYED5RFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is truly a lovely camera, the fit and finish, at first look, appear flawless- no rough edges, the seams are almost undetectable, whatever the opposite of \"shoddy\" is, I'll call it that. The silver pieces- chromed plastic maybe- seem a little bit delicate, in contrast to the body. The buttons and dials relevant to shooting are laid out in an ergonomically correct fashion that they can almost all be easily operated with one hand.A very easy to view LCD screen- 2-3/8 X 1-3/4 pulls out on a n angle bracket where it can tip up fully 90\u00b0 and downward about 45\u00b0 The viewfinder has a diopter control for individual adjustment, always nice- but what was a pleasant surprise was how putting your eye up to the viewfinder shuts off the LCD> Nice touch. I prefer to shoot with a VF, so this could mean significant savings of battery life.The memory card door- for the SD chip, is likewise smooth and functions well, as does the chip eject mechanism. As do most all of the other controls. Design-wise, there is a lot to like.Functionally?It's not that I do not like this camera, I will say straightaway that I do, very much. For what it is it is well designed and executed.What I do not like is the pattern of thought which believes a camera of this much complexity and control and possessing features few people will ever learn, let alone use with any success, is somehow a good idea.But I am thinking that my basic premise, perhaps unwise for a reviewer of digital cameras, is that they are inherently dishonest. I just now tried to capture the stunning effects of the light after a dramatic late spring thunderstorm, and it looked like crap. No matter what setting I chose. I have no doubt that even the simplest point-and-shoot film camera would have succeeded. I don't get it.This is my first \"real\" DSC, so while I should not dwell on my learning curve, I believe it is important to comment accordingly as no doubt some of you reading this may also be first-time shoppers.I have a lot of habits from using a Nikon SLR for many years, and they were of little use in transitioning to this camera. I realize SLR's for years have always been right-hand prejudiced, but it was still possible to carry one comfortably in either hand. The Fuji demands, but the shape of the right side, it must be swung right handed.As I have examined cameras in stores, I was always baffled by the selector dial- what could all those settings be for? And buttons? The Fuji has eighteen. My old Nikon FM2 has one. The shutter. And only five controls. I can't add up all the functions of the Fuji, but here's the descriptions given when you rotate the selector knob. I will not delve into the descriptions, if you really want to know, you'll have to print out and study the 145 page manual like I did:AUTO: Automatic mode setting according to shooting conditionsSR AUTO: Scene Recognition Auto- selects optimum camera settings for certain modesADV: this is a programmable setting which takes you into a sub-menu where the following choices, and  are yours: Motion Remover  Multi-Motion Capture  Pro Low-LightSP1: Scene Position: \"Choose a scene suited to the subject or shooting conditions and let the camera do the rest\" So then you have a sub-menu containing 16 choices- i.e \"Beach\", \"Fireworks\", \"Party\", \"Sunset\", \"Night\"- so, what to do if you are going to a party at the beach that goes til after dark and then they have fireworks? Change it for each event? What if you get it wrong? Sheesh.SP2: Same as SP2. At least it makes choosing the wrong scene half as likely. As long as you remember to switch, And can remember how they were set up..Panorama: Take ultra-wide panoramic image by sweeping the camera. (The resulting image is of questionable value, except perhaps onscreen.)C: Custom. Shooting mode with user settingM: Manual mode with the shutter speed and apertureA: Aperture Priority Automatic: mode with user setting the apertureS: Shutter Priority AE: Automatic mode with user setting the shutter speedP- Program AE: Automatic Mode with programmed settingGot it? OK, RTFM if you really want to know, then play. I really question the value of so many presettables- a friend of mine with a different brand but similar controls admits he has to refresh his memory if he goes too long between uses. Or has used another brand in the meantime.Seems to me, all you really need is full auto or full manual. A walk down any grocery store aisle will show you immediately how much people like choices, this must be the logic to this trend of design. The more features they build in, relevant or not, the more they can charge. I would think at this point to compare photographers to guitarists- unlikely, I know, but hear me out:  using a ton of bitchin' effects may fool people into thinking you're a decent player, but if you truly are, you only need three knobs. Part- no, most all of being a good photographer is knowing what *is* a great shot, not what device makes one for you.I find the flash assembly, while elegant in appearance and nearly mechanically perfect, also fully blocks the top of the focus ring and half of the zoom. I am to the point where using these two controls is instinctive, and having to compensate for this protuberance is irritating to the extreme. When shooting video, it would take a lot of practice to pull off decently smooth zooms.  And no, I do not wish to \"get used to it\" or defer to the automatic modes, but I probably will. Not to mention, the zoom ring has a decidedly binding feel as the elements pop out. When using the video setting, the zoom is nearly completely worthless. And not to mention, the illumination provided by the flash seems inadequate at best. Equally strange, if the camera is set to \"silent\" mode, the forced flash setting is unavailable. I had to disable the sounds all manually before I was able to use it in this manner. Might be a glitch, it makes no sense.As for the flash itself, the delay between shots is simply unacceptable. Fifteen seconds or so. With my very cheap Vivitar flash and my trusty SLR I could pop a shot off every 4 seconds. Not like this is a real life need to be scenario, but with a camera that pretends to be state-of-the-art it just seems absurd. And, not only that: the built-in flash has to be erected before the external can fire. My Vivitar blocks it from full extension, so I cannot really say if it would have helped. The built-in flash is supposed to be adjustable, but I have not found the procedure for that yet.I am tempted to pick up a hot-shoe adapter to see if this can be improved by an external device.For that matter, one of the most important aspects of a digital camera is how fast it gets up to speed. As I mentioned, I can't yet compare the Fuji to others, except my ancient Sony- and I always felt it was really slow to start and shoot. This camera actually takes almost twice as long. Time between shots is slow, I realize this may be due on part to battery condition, and while I am using brand-new Energizer Lithium's, until I put more powerful cells in there I will have to temper this judgment. As far as battery life, I am still on that set, but the ones that were provided with the camera went flat before I was halfway through familiarizing myself with the manual.As far as the choice of AA cells instead of a dedicated pack: my earlier experience with the little Sony finally convinced me I would avoid it again if I could. It seems like a good idea at first to be able to pick up batteries anywhere should an emergency strike, but it seems a dedicated fully charged spare or two should be all one needs. I find even the best rechargeable AA's are often inadequate, and certainly degrade over time. Lithiums cells average $2-3 each, and unless they can power this camera through several full days of shooting, I hate the idea of shelling out twelve bucks every few weeks.The video function, we have yet to talk about. Unlike everything else on this camera, it is operated by a single button and seems fairly straightforward. But no, once again there are still countless choices to be made, frame rate, aspect ratio, high speed, low speed, not to mention almost equally as many playback and in-camera editing capabilities.Image quality? Sometimes excellent, sometimes acceptable. Due to the wide range of choices to the user, I have not found the perfect settings for all the test shots I have made, but over 300 in widely differing conditions I still haven't found the sweet setting.I have not been able to comment on the included software, it seems every device manufacturer included a photo transfer and editing application, some good, some not so. For the most part I stick with what I know- manual transfer and Photoshop. Images may be transferred by removing and reading the SD card, or with the included mini-USB cable. You cannot remove the images from the camera if you use the cable, which I found unusual. There is also a mini HDMI port for direct viewing to a TV. Viewing the images in the camera offers nearly as many choices as do the shooting menus.I am not sure if I could recommend this camera or not, it would take a lot more experience with the variables to confidently say \"you'll learn to love it..\" To one more familiar with this type of shooting and design I may seem a bit harsh, although I suspect the  self-satisfying wealth of \"features\" are more the norm these days. There are so many choices for any shot one might make, how could you ever remember which worked best? I cannot say that Fuji is alone in promoting this consumerist-driven orgy of tech, but I can say this: If I could find a simpler digital that delivered consistently good images without so much homework I would probably choose that one.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "pretty good bang for the buck", "Author": "Donald A.

Was tired of packing so much stuff and sold it all this winter and patiently awaited this camera. Well shot some with it yesterday and over all pretty impressed. There are a few things I didnt like about this camera. 1: no ITTL flash function just a hot shoe. 2: no remote trigger port. 3: since the camera doesnt know you have a flash on it you cant seem to dial the shutter speed up to make any sence of even usuing an external flash. The other side to that is the ISO is incrediable on this camera. 1600 is totally usuable on this critter. The DR range settings are incrediable. The viewing screen is amazing, I did have the low battery light come on after about 200 shots but i did have the screen running a lot. So ill set some settings and see if i can turn that off. Havent tried video yet, The image stablizer really works well. Inside low light with out a flash was incrediable. I think this camera will do just what they are saying it will. Fill in the gap between a small point and shoot right up to the edge of a full size DSLR. They only draw back i see is the sensor is the same size as most of the smaller point and shoots, This camera does drop the MP's in some settings to shut down some of the sensors to pick up more light. I dont see this as a problem. My first camera was a 6mp fuji s6000fd. I have some wonderful shots made (8x10) and no pixles can be seen. After all, a steady hand I think will make better pictures than more pixles.

Smaller sensor does cause deterioration in image quality. Another thing to consider is it has a steep learning curve. you need to get used to many options before we can get the best out of it. In spite of that many experts have had pieces that had problems and so the camera had to be returned. mostly being fast battery drain, focusing issues, and totally off white balance. Some were able to resolve it by resetting the camera to factory settings. May be a bad case of in-factory installation, totally unacceptable.good points:1. large zoom (30X, 24-720 mm equivalent).2. excellent controls.3. HD (1080P) and high speed movie modes. For this alone I think the camera is worth it's price. I have some at my blog [...]4. manual zoom for accurate zooming. I guess this is also to reduce the drain on batteries.5. Raw support.6. BSI CMOS sensor for better low light performance.7. innovative modes. panorama, low light pro, best shot, motion remover, multi motion and so on.

If you select wrong battery type, there is a possibility you will get erratic behavior on battery indicator.9. 58 mm thread for filters and converters.now the bad:1. The camera does aggressive noise reduction. I will be comfortable deciding myself whether I want NR or not, rather than the camera smearing half my image details. The work around is using RAW and then creating your own JPG, but that increases card write times. I have written to Fuji about it.2. The write times. If you are using raw, the camera uses 3-4 seconds to write. if you use burst mode, camera freezes upto 17 seconds before it's written to the card. good thing is you can cancel it and lose the unwritten images if you need to shoot again quickly. My old nikon L6 pocket camera can shot at around 1 FPS continuously. This one has no such option.4. stiff zoom and other noises. When you take a video, the zoom will appear to be jerky, because it is. It's very difficult to keep the camera steady while zooming. Also, the camera makes noise when it adjusts focus or aperture, and there is no way to add an external mic to avoid that.5. no remote. I have never used one, but I would love to, give the long zoom.given the Pros, the only other substitutes I can think of are nikon P100, and casio EX-FH series.

Very Very versatile. Till date I think the only camera that has more zoom power than this camera is the new Canon that supposed to have 35x when it comes out. Not sure if its out yet tho.Picture quality: Better than expected from a compact superzoom. If stabilized well, the pictures are quite sharp.Stabilization: Cmon. It IS 30-freakin-X. You will need a good amount of stabilization for the tele end unless you are shooting in a very bright setting with ample light.Features: Packed with lot of features, however many are useless I feel. I have never used the panaromic one as I always tend to merge them myself in computer after taking several solo pics. Doesn't take that long and gives a much better result. But for the sake of feature, it's a fun feature to do it in-camera..just beware of artifacts.Conclusion: All in all a very fun feature packed camera. But with the advent of the 4/3rd's like EPL-1 EP-2 or even the NEX-3/5 by sony, If I had a choice between this and them, Picture quality wins by far, and I would trade in my HS10.

There's a lot of reviews that talk about more detailed specifics if you're looking for a critique on every aspect of this camera, but I'll spare you and just focus on what I found to be most important.First, this is an incredible piece of equipment in the totality of the package. The pictures that it takes - if you know what you're doing and you spend some time experimenting with this camera and messing with the settings, are very nice and impressive. The range of presets are quite elaborate but honestly meant to satiate the consumer and not the professional. If you know what you're doing, you'll likely steer clear of them and use manual, but they're good for using them on the fly and if you have little experience. This is an easy camera to master.The video it takes is also quite good and stands up quite well on its own as it is HD. However, because of the fixed lens and the lack of control of the video, you cannot compare the video quality to what you might get from a higher end Canon or a Canon in the same price bracket. I'm not comparing this to a higher end camera myself, but the maker had intended this camera, with on board video to be at least a runner-up, if not a competitor to the new trend of hand held cameras being able to support video.One of the most attractive qualities about this camera though is the Zoom lens. The ability of a fixed lens being able to do what this camera does, maintain a sharp image and handle stability is really impressive. The size of the camera and the compact stubby nature seems to lend this device to be used if you're going to try and conceal yourself if you catch my meaning. With a 30 times zooom, I can't see what else something like that would be used for. It's very effective and delivers solid images from a very long distance. I've added two pics in the images above which were taken almost simultaneously. All I did was zoom out.However ...The biggest downfall of this though, and I'm surprised no one has really touched on it, is the battery life. For the record, the Manufacturer decided to use four regular AA batteries as a power source instead of a standard OEM style battery like Canon or Nikon typically use. I researched this to see if these was a new trend in camera development and sad to say - it just isn't. I couldn't believe the amount of power consumption this camera eats up with as many batteries as it requires to operate. But the reality is, at the end of the day - this isn't really a camera - It's a computer dressed up as a camera and that's going to require a lot of power.Typically, I can get about 450-600 shots from an OEM battery with my Canon 20D and about 325-375 from the battery in my Canon Powershot. With this, and 4 AA batteries, I was able to only manage just under 250 single shots. I usually take an extra battery or two in my camera bag if I think I'm going to take that many, and I often do. In this case, even just doing headshots, I'm forced to carry around a 20 pack of batteries and that's an added cost and a bit of a pain. With video, I consistently was getting around 35-38 minutes of footage before having to change out. I have nothing to compare that to in that price range, so it's just something to consider.I found the poor energy conservation with this device a real achilles heel and if I was on the fence about buying this camera, I probably wouldn't as I don't think that the tech and ability of this camera warrant such a sacrifice. Also, Fuji will probably release a newer version of this camera, if they already haven't, that has better battery capability or even an OEM battery.I was perplexed at who made the decision to go with AA's on this and I just can't wrap my head around it. Even using the more expensive, longer lasting AA's, I still wasn't satisfied because the benefit doesn't outwiegh the cost - at least not yet. I'd say back to the drawing board with the battery power on this one.If the power issue doesn't bother you, you'll likely love the results you get from this and be nominally happy with the onboard HD video....", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "I've tried to like this camera...", "Author": "Phil \"Phil\"", "ReviewID": "R113HEGEGD30IH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I read the reviews and despite the shortcomings was seduced by the feature list.

Fujifilm FinePix HS10 is neither a point-and-shoot nor is it an SLR. It's manufacturers wanted to accomplish both and, as is sadly often the case, wound up accomplishing neither.As compared to any point-and-shoot on the market, Fujifilm FinePix HS10 is perhaps a more comprehensive product. Yet, the retail price far exceeds almost all other point-and-shoot cameras on the market (Nikon Coolpix P6000 13.5MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoomis an exception).A lot has been mentioned about the impressive 30 meters wide lens on the Fujifilm Finepix HS10. Admittedly, that is what attracted me to this camera as well. Still, what good is a long distance lens if it takes blurry shots at any distance?As compared to the Canon and Nikon low-end DSLRs, well, I think it's not fair to Canon and Nikon to do that. It's not unreasonable to purchase any of the Canon Rebel cameras or Nikon D30/D40 series for a little over $100 on top of the price of the Fujifilm Finepix HS10. Yet, buying those cameras guarantees quality and performance and longevity that I haven't seen in my experience with Fujifilm Finepix HS10.After several sessions that were spent studying all the possibilities of the settings - trust me, this is not your average, \"Figure it out on your own sans manual\" electronic device, I decided that I was ready to use this camera as my primary camera for a photoshoot.To that end, I had taken the camera, and the Fujifilm 4GB SDHC card that came with the camera, on a photoshoot of my niece. Out of about 20 pictures, I was able to capture only one without noise - the camera's shutter-speed is simply not quick enough to reflect the movement of children (or even the most subdued animals, such as my dog).Half-way through the photoshoot, with the camera being about two months old, the camera showed the screen of death. I received an \"unable to read card\" message. This was frustrating and disappointing - I was able to restore the lost pictures off the memory card with my computer software, but I am reluctant to ever trust my Fujifilm Finepix HS10 again. The worst thing for a photographer is to go somewhere and to have something go wrong with the equipment.Even if I found this camera's manual sufficient in explaining all the settings, even if I found the camera's lack of clarity and stability not intrinsic to the basic quality of a good camera, even if I found the fact that the camera does not improve my good picture ratio but diminishes it, I'd still be unable to recommend this camera based on its loss of fidelity and stability when it came time to deliver pictures during a photoshoot.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible zoom ring", "Author": "BookWorm", "ReviewID": "R178ELGHIJOSC2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Great set of features, LIGHTWEIGHT for this type of camera, AA batteries and MANUAL zooming considerably extending batteries life, flip LCD etc. Don't want to repeat other reviewers, those were the features in the same package I've been looking for for years to have an alternative to carrying DSLR with 3-5 lenses. On paper it looked like THE camera and when I finally found it in a real store, it felt just right in my hand - well balanced, the body and the lens smaller than on photos. Unfortunately, only until I tried to grab the zoom ring - the long flash (good engineering, the lens doesn't block the light) overhangs tightly over the zooming ring. HS10 looks OK in 3D at Fuji website but in reality the flash seems almost glued to a WIDE COMFORTABLY RUBBERIZED zoom (terrible engineering, one thing cancels the other, simply no explanation for that), nothing fits in-between. Apparently the design was copied from s100fs but they removed an ample space clearly seen on the frontal s100fs pic at Amazon page that leaves less than 1/4\" for your fingers to grab. Although mines are slender, zooming with left hand holding the ring from the upper or left side is extremely awkward. The only uncluttered hold is from the bottom, so instead of easy 180+ degree rotation you have only 60-80 and not as fast as with normal hold. Together with slow writing speed (hope Fuji will fix it with firmware upgrades) and problems with manual focus (another design flop) it means that a lot of your would be best shots will be lost. Huge disappointment, it seems that Fuji put their heart in this camera but forgot a couple of crucial basic things...

This is not a point and shoot model, I cannot imagine what Fuji was thinking.  People using this grade of camera with all of its controls will be smart enough to push a button to switch between EVF and LCD. Even without glasses the EVF is MUCH TO SMALL.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND the purchase of this camera.

Its color fringing at longest focal length was obvious and annoying and I sent the camera to Olympus Repairs which did some work on the lens, but it was still not to my satisfaction. The Olympus showed small but not insignificant barrel distortion at widest angle. The Fuji, on the other hand, shows virtually no color fringing at longest focal length, and no perceptible distortion at widest angle. The instruction for taking a Panorama is incorrect, and automatic image stitching at widest angle is quite poor. It is awkward to review images, to enlarge and reduce them in size requires reading buttons with microscopic blue on black lettering. The button to review images is on the lower right of the camera body, making it hard to firmly grip the camera body without accidentally shutting down the picture taking mode.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD CAMERA AT ABRGAN PRICE", "Author": "DAMIAN \"ERNIE\"", "ReviewID": "R25UPTDDNKR55G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "IHAVE BEEN A PROHOTOGRAPHER FOR 40 YEARS....SO MY EXPIERNCE IS NOT LIMITED TO \"POINT AND SHOT\" CAMERA...THIS CAMERA IS JUST AMAZIN,I ALSO OWN THE FINE PIX S9100,IS A VERY GOOD CAMERA AS LONG AS YOU SHOOT AT ISO 100 OR 80,BUT VERY NOISE WHEN YOU GO UP.THE QUA;ITI OF THE HS10 IS COMPARABLE TO ME TO MY D80 AND GET EVEN CLOSER TO DE D90,THE  BODY IS LIGHT AND ALL CONTROLS ARE VERY EASY AND FAST TO USE.THE HD MOVIE THAT MAYBE I AHVE NOT TRIED IN FULL IS SO SO THERE ARE SOME LINES THAT MAYBE I DO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING.BUT I REALLY RECOMEND THIS CAMERA FOR PICTURE TAKING,BUY AN EXTERNAL FLASH LIKE SUNPAK OR VIVITAR AND BOUNCE THE FLASH FOR VERY PROFESSIONAL RESULTS.MY OTHER CAMERAS I OWN D80,D90,CANON 4OD,CANON5D AND NINOK D300.DO NOT EXPECT A SOLID BODY..BUT I REALLY LOVE THE ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER CAMERAS YOU GOT WHAT YOU SEE,THE NOT THE SAME WITH MIRROR DSLR CAMERAS UNLESS YOU ,LOSE TIME LOOKING AT THE LCD DOSPLAY,SONY AND OTHER MANUFACTURES AND CONSIDERING REPLACE THE MIRROR FOR ELECTRONIC VIRWFINDER AND IN THE NEAR FUTURE ALL PROFESSIONAL DSLR CAMERAS WILL GET RID OUT OF THE OBSOLETE MIRROR,THAT WAS VERY USEFUL WITH FILM CAMERAS BUT NOT WITH DIGITAL...JUSR TAKE A LOOK TO PROFESSIONAL VIDEO CAMERAS,WHAT THEY USE MIRRORS???...OR THE ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDERS?THIS LAST IS THE NEAR FUTURE OF THE PRO-DSLRI EECOMEND IT.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "10-megapixel CMOS image sensor for superior low-light performance and photo-quality, poster-sized prints\nFujinon 30x (24-720mm equivalent) manual optical zoom lens; 24-720mm (equivalent on a 35mm camera) range from true wide-angle to ultra telephoto\nHD movie mode with stereo sound; mini HDMI output\nTriple Image Stabilization; 'Super Intelligent' Flash\n3.0-inch High-Contrast Tilting LCD and Electronic View Finder\n3.0-inch High-Contrast Tilting LCD and Electronic View Finder\nTriple Image Stabilization , Super Intelligent Flash\nFujinon 30x (24-720mm equivalent) manual optical zoom lens; 24-720mm (equivalent on a 35mm camera) range from true wide-angle to ultra telephoto\n10-megapixel CMOS image sensor for superior low-light performance and photo-quality, poster-sized prints\nHD movie mode with stereo sound and mini HDMI output", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix HS10 10 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 30x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41myh0YDQyL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0035WTVZA"}}
