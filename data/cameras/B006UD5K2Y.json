The zoom can be grainy when used to the fullest extent, but when not zoomed the angle is quite wide and the macro has two great settings, regular and ultra.  The camera also has an awesome panorama setting!  There are many functions, you need to read the manual. The only negative points I have so far is the fit of the lens cap (not tight enough, falls off) and the battery/sd card compartment is difficult to open and close, the plastic is cheap.  Not for rough use. The recent shots I took of a local visit to somt Tall Ships are awesome!", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Entry Level Camera", "Author": "RS45AZ", "ReviewID": "R1MSVWUCHJTA88", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Fuji FinePix S2980 isn't an amazing camera, but don't let that put you off of it if you're interested in a budget entry level camera or a cheap/lightweight point & shooter.It definitely doesn't do too well indoors or in low light conditions, but that's to be expected in a camera this affordable. Time between shots isn't the best but I've suffered much worse.

Also,having the same repair problem within 7 months raises a red flag.So, I will trash it & not be buying another Fujifilm product.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera for beginner photographers", "Author": "N. Cousino", "ReviewID": "RVI3LV4WALZ6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is fantastic for those who have never known anything other than your cheap, standard 'point and shoot' cameras that don't allow for any customization.  This camera offers all of your standard 'point and shoot' options, but it also offers so much more so for those who want to learn this is a great (and affordable) way to do so.This Fujifilm Finepix camera has so many options and features I couldn't begin to cover them all, but some of my favorite are the red eye removal, panoramic feature, continuous shooting, intelligent flash, blink detection, scene recognition, and there is even a PhotoBook Assist that helps you create your own photo books.  Once you get comfortable with your camera you can create your own settings by controlling the aperture and shutter speed, and even save your favorite settings to use again.  The camera comes with an extensive and very thorough yet easy to understand manual that covers all of these options and settings.The only feature I'm not in love with is the video recording option - it works in a pinch, but it's not fantastic.  Zooming while recording video reduces the quality of the image, and the sound is not great - there is always some residual white background noise and you can hear the sound of the lens zooming in and out while recording.  It's ok for recording something at the spur of the moment, but for filming special events you definitely want something better.Overall I'm very pleased with this - photography has become much more interesting and exciting and I've made it a habit to never leave home without my camera.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera for the money", "Author": "SoccerCoach", "ReviewID": "RY9AC8CSV825Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera showed up on time.

There is a little bit of delay with this one but not nearly enough of one to bother me.This camera is so easy to use.  I usually put it in different modes to take the same picture just so I can see the variations. The best thing is the panorama mode.  You take 1 picture and then turn either right or left and in the view finder it shows you exactly where to stop to line up a perfect shot next to the one you just took.  It really is a neat function.  You can do this with 2 or 3 shots and set it up to go right or left.  I'm always amazed at how much can be done in such a small package.  I did buy a case for this to carry extra batteries and a battery charger but you can throw this in your purse, too.  If, like me, you carry a big purse.  It's not small like a camera phone but its not huge either.

Since these cameras also typically run on batteries, the use of the display depletes the charge fairly quickly. The Fujifilm camera has a great 3 in. display and a viewfinder. I shot photos mostly using the viewfinder thus mitigating the drainage on the 4 AA batteries. With a 14MP resolution and 18X optical zoom (can be augmented by setting up digital zoom in the set up menu), and an extensive set of features, this camera is a great value. BTW, photo quality is very good especially in low light (great for museum/cathedral etc... that do not allow flash photography).

In the meantime, I have a camera that was a couple hundred dollars plus a mega new card and can't use it. Less than 3 months old and used a handful of times. Shame on Fuji and dealers that won't flat out tell customers that they're screwed when they call for help. I've had mine too long, can't take it back with my reciept.

I love having the viewfinder option and using basic AA batteries (two of my main reasons for choosing this camera over others)The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the auto mode doesn't always produce the same quality of photos as the point-and-shoot I owned before this. With a little care and some adjustments, this camera has served me well. It has the option of changing many settings and I have taken some pretty nice pictures with a little care.

Eighty percent of the time or more, the pictures come out blurry, out of focus, dark, etc., and this is under still conditions.  When someone actually moves when you're trying to take the picture, forget it - it won't even take the picture!  There is no \"action\" setting as far as I can tell, and I have tried all of the settings to no avail.  The flash completely bleaches out faces.  In full sunlight, with a still subject, the pictures are decent, but in any other conditions, they are terrible.  The hardware is flimsy.  The cap falls off constantly.

There is no oer way to download your pictures. My cable has been misplaced, so for the past month or so Ihaven't even been able to download the images straight from the Memory Card, like I'm able to do with other cameras. the card reads as blank unless it's connected directly from the camera.2: You have no option for fine-tuning the zoom manually.
