I say this typically when only a couple of reviews are bad. Almost every review I read on the samsung SL600 is a great review and I  must concur now that I have bought the camera. This is a fabulous digicam. You can always tell how nice a product is  by how sold out it is at stores and very few Targets had any of these items in stock. I was lucky to find one  8 miles north that had 1 left. Great camera!!! I am going to have to find another though because my mother wants to get away from film and this one will be  perfect for her. The buttons are nicely placed and arent intimidating", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worth the price", "Author": "Zero2Cool", "ReviewID": "RH3MNMUEM6VC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of these pictures. It worked well right out of the box, but I did tweak some settings after testing it. Took some great shots of Horsetooth mountain with it. Good quality capturing on zoom as well.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good features and price", "Author": "Andrew Nowak", "ReviewID": "R3Q1YRZK3HO7ZO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was actually bought for a friend working at St. Georges Caye Resort in Belize, based on his Internet research.  Good report back from friend.  Has all the features for good group shots.  He is happy to get so much camera for such a good price. Unfortunately cannot comment directly until I get to the SCUBA Resort and see it in action.  Based on his experience I can say an employee of the resort asked for same camera.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Robert K. Mertz", "ReviewID": "R3VTOKEPCDZYY0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera on a woot sale since I've been happy with Samsung products before and I was looking for a good digital camera.  I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pictures and videos that I take with this camera.  The camera is fairly easy to use although at times the menus feel like they could use some cleaning up.  My only major complaint with this camera is that it does not use a standard USB connector for charging or for data transfers so it is important that you do not lose the cable that comes with the camera.  The camera isn't powered by standard batteries but the battery pack is replaceable so you can always carry a spare with you.  If you are looking for a good quality camera that you can just pick up and shoot without having to worry about light settings, etc, then this is probably the camera for you.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Basic Digital Camera", "Author": "Brett Huguenard", "ReviewID": "R1N58OJXT4X8Z1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is very affordable and quite user friendly as well. The only negative thing I have to say about this camera is that it doesn't have the traditional view finder that I sometimes prefer. However, it does have a nice size LCD screen like most all digital cameras, so it's still easy to use and with the screen, you'll know exactly what the image will look like before you take it.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung SL600:  A nice pocket camera.", "Author": "Ronnie Casebeer", "ReviewID": "RD8733QKOW7VE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well pleased with my SL600.  It makes a very nice pocket camera.  I have used Cannon cameras for years but found the Samsung better in this area.  It clearly beat the comparably priced Cannon in low light shots, battery life and ease of use. I originally purchased one of these for a parent, and  was impressed enough that I purchased one for me.  The size makes it possible for me to have a camera with me where normally I would not.  It of course beats the smart phone camera's hands down.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Customer service is awful", "Author": "Raura78", "ReviewID": "R37E4Q0WAOL94C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have this camera. Samsung replaced a lemon camera we owned with this. It is taking blurry pictures. The blur is not operator induced as my other camera takes clear pictures. Samsung's customer service is awful. I would strongly suggest not purchasing Samsung brand camera based solely on the fact that if you end up with a problem Samsung will not stand behind you or their product. We had to send our 1st camera back 3 times before they even considered replacing it. (waited over a month after the third trip back for service, to find out what the status was of our service call was) They have a 6 minute time limit to deal with your problem, if your problem is not solved within the alloted 6 minutes you can just forget about getting your issue resolved. If you doubt this just google Samsung reviews and read them for yourself. Be advised that if you have a problem, which, imho, will probably happen, you will be spending months upon months trying to get your problem resolved. Even if the camera was free I would not accept a Samsung camera. If you have purchased this I wish you a problem free, carefree experience! If you are thinking about a Samsung, consider Cannon, Nikkon, or Sony first, you will thank yourself in the end.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "Megapixels: 12.2 Megapixels\nFeatures: Blink Detection, Face Detection Technology, Digital Image Stabilization, Color TFT LCD Screen, Brightness Adjustment\nZoom: 3.0 X Digital , 5.0 X Optical\nSlide-Show, Zoom Playback, Movie With Sound, Landscape, Night Scene, Natural Light, Indoor, Portrait, TV-Quality AVI Movie\nMemory: 25MB Built In; Display Size: 2.7 \"\nImage Resolution: Up to 4000 x 3000\nDisplay Indicators: Date Imprint Indicator, White Balance Mode, Image Size, Focus Area, Battery Level, Flash Mode, ISO Setting, Shooting Mode\nPlayback File Formats: AVI Movie with Sound/ WMV\nImage Editing Features: Image Rotation, Image Resizing, Photo Trim\nAperture Range: f3.2 (W) / f5.9 (T) Wide ; f/3.2 - f/5.9 Telephoto\nFocus Range: 1.3' to Infinity Normal Wide Angle\nPhoto Effects: Resize View Finder Type: LCD Only\nCamera Flash Features: Red-Eye Reduction, Fill-In Flash, Auto On/Off\nCamera Lens Features: Auto Focus, Wide Angle\nMultiMediaCard (MMC), Secure Digital (SD) Card, Secure High Capacity (SDHC) Card\nIncludes: Wrist Strap, Instruction Manual, Installation CD, Battery, Quick Start Guide, USB Cable, AC Power Adapter, Camera Drivers\nRequired, Not Included: SD Memory Card\nPower Source: Battery-Powered\nDimensions: Length: 2.3 \"; Width: 3.8 \"; Depth: 0.83 \"; Product Weight: 0.26 Lb.\nWarranty Description: 1 Year Limited Manufacturer Warranty", "Name": "Samsung 12MP Metal Body Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41u-jxXDZ9L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0035EJLDA"}}
