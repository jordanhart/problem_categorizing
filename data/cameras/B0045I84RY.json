It IS a 4-star camera system for the money (in its class). This is installed in a mid-sized office suite (in the common/public areas). This has been running continuosly for over a year and has never had an issue. We recall video footage pretty regularly. Picture quality is better than average at this price point (you won't be reading licence plates from outer space, but you should be able to identify a person within 30'.) I have used three simillar systems and this one is my favorite. One word of caution: If this will not be on a network and synced to a time server, it will not keep time very well. It loses/gains time at about the rate of a cheap watch or old computer, which is to say that is you review your tapes weekly and correct the time weekly (even every few weeks), it stays close enough. If you let it get too far off, be very careful that you won't need to recall video from the recent past. These units do not know what to do about time adustments and, for example, any videos which appear to be from the future will simply be lost (inaccesible).", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$379.00", "Features": "4 CH Surveillance DVR with 500GB HD installed\nH.264 Hardware Compression\nNetwork and Remote Access 3G Mobile Remote Live!
