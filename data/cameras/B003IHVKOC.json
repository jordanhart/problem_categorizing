It has a lot of bang for the buck. You can keep it as simple as you want or take advantage of all the manual settings.  The menu is very simple to navigate.  I bought this on a recommendation from my brother who not only sells cameras, but owns two of this model now.  When I saw the red one, I knew I had to have it.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love It!", "Author": "Mire", "ReviewID": "R2I1V95JRD6672", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered my camera 1.14.2011 & got it 1.15.2011.  I love it! Granted I am still reading up on everything.  I have a traditional 8 mp digital & still love taking pics with my good ol' 35 mm. The K-x fits right in.  The two lenses are great. My fave feature so far is the manual option. Do invest in a UV filter & read all of the other reviews, they helped a lot when it came time to purchase. As to the color, don't buy a red camera unless you want one & the strap was not that hard to insert.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pentax wins!", "Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "R6246T7MNSG0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera held up with all the other brands.  Took it with me to a trip where I had horrible luck in the past.  Pictures turned out  OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!

I read the 315-page manual, but wish there was more detail to it. Most of the pics I took were from using the auto pic mode, and they turned out very well - both indoors and outdoors. Later I attended a week long National Geographic photo workshop where I was only allowed to operate the camera using the manual setting. I was the ONLY Pentax user amongst 20 other gizmo'd up Nikon or Canon users. The result was my K-x kept up with the best of them!  One minor issue I noticed was that the viewfinder shows only 96% of the actual field of view. So, unless you're a cropper, you need to be aware that even though it looks perfectly framed, you might pick up little distractions around the edges of the shot. It may be designed that way so one does not inadvertently crop off the top of a head of someone.  I am quite happy with this camera and see no reason to want to upgrade to something with LCD readouts or whatever. Also, a lot of people stop me since they've never seen a totally red camera before - you can definitely pick it out in a crowd!", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Buy I every made on Amazon", "Author": "Bret", "ReviewID": "R2OPKY6YZJP9CR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best buys I have made on Amazon. I love this camera. It was a great deal with both lenses.The build is nice,the red color is a plus, people ask about about it and I get to tell them how great Pentax cameras are. Pentax is underrated big time. Cost less the Cannon and Nikon and more features to compatible models. The thing that is great is the amount of old film lens you can buy cheap. They can be used  no manual focus but the stabilizer does work. The stabilizers are built in the body not in the lens and that keeps the cost down. See my photos (bretms3) and others on flickr; look under photos taken with this camera. I did a lot of research on what DSLR to buy  and this was what I thought was the best buy for the money. I know the AA batteries can be an issue for some, even me at the time. Not an issue at all especially when traveling.  You can't go wrong with this camera for an entry level DSLR. I'm so happy with this buy and Pentax that I will upgrade to the higher end Pentax model next.enjoy.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for anyone who is wanting to learn more about digital photography.", "Author": "Ilikakada", "ReviewID": "R2W0M8HADZ0PND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after looking at many different digital SLRs. I've had it for about three weeks now, and I don't regret the purchase. Too much. I'll get into that. First, the best things about it.-It's a great beginner camera, with auto getting just the right conditions, and with a manual mode for those who want to really get personal with the picture.-Speaking of modes, it's loaded with them for every situation you might be faced with.-Came with TWO lenses. The kit lens matches the color of the camera, which is great, and the 50-200mm is a wonderful addition for those who want to stand back from everything while still capturing it.-The in-camera digital filters are great for tweaking your photos. I really like the subtract color and toy camera filters myself.-The built-in flash is plenty fine for beginning photography and the occasional night-time shot.-SD card storage means no card readers and compact flash cards, another plus for beginners.-Nice strap, easy on the neck.-Is a K-mount camera. Pentax has made K lenses for a few decades, and they all will fit any K mount body made. Invest in some antique glass if you can.-Has live-view on the back screen, a true advantage for digital cameras these days.-Now, this could be a pro AND a con, but it takes four AA batteries. As long as your batteries are rated at 2300 mAs or higher, you should be alright. Anything less will be eaten up by this thing.As for the things that I don't like about it, which are more personal issues, are actually minor things. Such as..-The color is a little obnoxious, but you'll never mistake it for someone else's camera for sure.-Autofocus is just odd to me, but I use Manual.-Neither of the lenses go below f4.0, which is a little disappointing. But for the price, acceptable.-I'm a little wary of just putting it in my backpack, I'm afraid of anything breaking (mostly a lens). I'd invest in a case for it as well.-Does not come with any UV filters. Pick some up at a local photo store for each lens, and if offered, have them put them on. The filters will protect the lenses from any sort of damage. A filter is cheap to replace. A lens could cost as much as the camera.-It's digital. In this age, I should accept this, but if you really care about photography, find an old film camera and shoot a few rolls of film. Learn to love an old camera, see the world in an analogue style.Like I said previously, this is a great camera for beginners and hobbyists alike, but I'm a film person. This will satiate the digital aspect of photography, and with room to grow farther into this field. If you are a beginner, I'd suggest something a little less intense, and if you're more advanced, save up a couple hundred more and get a Nikon D90. Great camera for the price.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Harder to figure out then one would think", "Author": "Croy", "ReviewID": "R3IRD06YIG5HDH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first serious camera and I am still reading the manual. I fail more often then not in taking the picture I want to take even with the auto pic. At least I am not using up film, it's so easy to delete the pictures on the card or to format the entire card once I have transferred them to my PC. Photoshop has saved more than one picture! I am too much of a newbie to truly evaluate the quality of this camera.

I just chose this because of its color. Almost all SLRs are just black and look everything same. But this is different. When I'm using this outside and people just say \"I love your camera!\". If you want something unique, this is good one. Of course it's pretty good and useful camera. Easy to use for beginner, and I think it has all basic functions as any other camera has. If we had more color selection as Japan has, I would buy orange or yellow.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003IHVKOC"}}
