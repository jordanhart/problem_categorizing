I'd compare the quality with my Sony 3.1 megapixel from 2005. Images will be fuzzy if viewed above a 5x7 size.The proprietary battery requires a charger that's the size of a pack of cigarettes. You can't charge with the USB cable so you may want to buy a second battery which lists for $44.99 ($15.00 street price). I would rather the camera be a little bigger and use AAA batteries then be stuck without a camera when the batteries died.Sound is recorded in movie mode, but you have to view on a computer or TV to hear the sound when played back. This camera has no speaker. Not a huge deal for me.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Okay, but not great", "Author": "Xander and Patrick's Nana", "ReviewID": "R23NAZDKJUH3Q1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had ordered a Sony camera, and had given them the wrong zip code.  I got an email that the camera was being returned to the company.  I called that company and they confirmed that I would need to reorder it.  My class was going on a field trip in a few days, and I wanted the camera for that, so I quickly ordered another camera from Amazon.  I knew Amazon would get the camera to me in time, and they did. I bought this camera because it used the same batteries and memory card as my older Olympus, and I thought that would be helpful.  As it turned out, the other camera WAS delivered.  I decided to keep both of them, since both were inexpensive cameras, and I take a lot of pictures.  I had always been satisfied with my little Olympus camera, the 7.1 megapixel one.  But seeing the Sony pictures, and comparing them to this new Olympus, I realize the Olympus just isn't quite as good.  It's okay, and I will use it in the classroom, or when we go on field trips, because I wouldn't be quite as sorry to lose it or have it broken as I would the Sony.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Battery Problem (Or mabye Battery Reader?)", "Author": "Ira Savatgy \"Ira.S\"", "ReviewID": "RMJVXH2AHI5I9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As with all the other reviews on this camera, It has a serious Battery problem.Either that or a Battery reader problem in the camera itself.After 5-10 photos with flash on a full battery, the camera will shut off with a \"low battery\" messageHowever,  if you wait a few minutes and than turn it back on again, you can take another 5 photos and than get thesame message with camera shut off.Even after that, you can still take more photos!The battery seems to be used amongst other Olympus cameras and they don't get bad reviews.And the batteries are super cheap too (about 8$ each) and only takes about 10 minutes to charge.This camera CANNOT take action shots!  they will be blurry.  Also there is no image stabilizer mode,so if you take a picture without a flash and your hands aren't perfectly still, than the picture will beblurry.However, the camera does take good still shots with a tripod. (or close up with a steady hand)When i purchased camera refurbished, it was 59$,  If i were you, i would not buy this camera until it comesdown to 40$UPDATE: after bout 4 months of super light use, the battery cannot even hold a charge. after a full charge, i can take maybe like 8 pictures?", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "worked fine for 3 years then died for no reason", "Author": "S.

I don't remember EVER dropping this camera, and I certainly didn't drop it just before it decided not to work any more.  I had a Canon Elph for several years and I did drop that one many times.While the camera is working, you can expect it to give you good quality photos and videos, but don't say I didn't warn you.

Unfortunately the images it produces are very low quality.  The images are out of focus and somewhat rotated from the image as it appeared on the LCD screen - (there goes the composition).
