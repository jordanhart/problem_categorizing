Minolta s414", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "RWERPFJH31GEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched digital cameras for several months to find THE one for me, a digicamaphobe.  THE camera is - the does it all AND at a reasonbable price - Minolta s414. I considered Canons, the G2, the Elph s230, various Olympus cams, and the easy,cheesy Sony.  The elph was easy to use, but small, awkward, and distance shots were blurry and pixilated. I tried a friend's Olympus, but it was kind of complicated for me, downloading seemed a pain...My sis emailed me Sony pics she took, but the quality wasn't there...In April, while shopping, a friend pointed out the Minolta s414, 4 megapixels and 4 times zoom with movie and sound. So, I researched it...From reviews and info about the s414 I learned it was truly awesome with options galore.  Additionally it was considered \"user friendly\"... I showed my boyfriend the info I'd found...An amateur photographer, he'd had never thought digicams could produce the quality of his NIKON, but he was impressed with the research I showed him; so he bought one.  He was immediately blown away with the quality from the moment he started using it.  His first macro shot of flowers with the s414 convinced him to set aside his Nikon.  Then he had me try he camera...and had trouble wresting it away from me, because the Minolta s414 REALLY IS USER FRIENDLY.I had to have the s414, and we went to buy mine...In addition to \"user friendly\",  we found \"sold out\" at three stores... At the fourth stop, we bought the demo... along with rechargeable batteries, a 256 picture card and card reader...Sunday, June 8, armed with our s414s, my boyfriend and I went to a dance recital and took some stupendous pictures in sepia and black and white as well as color ...EASY. ..After downloading the pics, we were amazed as we zoomed in on an eye to see the outline of my daughter taking the picture  was reflected in the pupil!!! I took 100 pictures and made three quick films, plus reviewed and downloaded the pics before needing to recharge the batteries...Now how awesome is that?  This camera RULES...", "Date": "June 8, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great camera. Updated report.", "Author": "Rheumor", "ReviewID": "ROAIZ7L8T0O3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I remain very happy with the S414. In fact, I have sold or given away almost all my other digicams. The one problem area with this Minolta had been its heavy battery use, but since I switched to 2,000 mAmp Monster batteries, this has become much less of an issue. I append my original review below:**************************************************************** This is about my 12th digital camera, and in general each one gets better in several ways as the technology expands. This one takes the place of a Sony P72 which I bought for about the same amount of money 8 months ago. However, the Minolta brings several higher end features to the table, including a 4 megapixel resolution (great clarity in poster-sized enlargements possible) and a true, 4X optical zoom, which was my main reason for upgrading. However, the icing on the cake, it turns out, is the 414's faster CPU, allowing it to wake up quickly and to write and recover faster btwn shots. In fact, it is so quick that it allows for continuous shooting of digital stills at 0.8 second intervals until either the battery is exhausted or the memory card is full. Likewise, it takes fairly good quality video *with* sound, as well as allowing for voice over of still images. The controls are logical, intuitive and clearly marked, the thru-the-lens framing is bright and easy to use, and playback on the 1.8\" LCD is clear even in bright haze. Even the synthesized camera-like sound effects are good; they are a pleasing means of non-visual feedback to the user. Of course, it's a camera, so the quality of the photographs is what really counts, and here I can say the Minolta optics are superb, easily trouncing the Sony & Olympus cams I've been using of late. Battery life has not been an issue for me, weight and balance are okay, and even the non-integral (but tethered) lens cap hasn't bothered me. It does, of course, need a much larger memory card right away; with a 256MB CF card I'm getting about 120 shots at the highest resolution.In short, this is an amazing camera at a very good price.", "Date": "July 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "INCREDIBLE value INCREDIBLE pictures", "Author": "Al Abama \"Al\"", "ReviewID": "R1HD8J522I8L9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cannot begin to tell you how impressed everyone was with the pictures I took with this camera. Many have seen digital... but this is something else. And for under [money]? 4MP images, 4X OPTICAL Zoom -- you won't find that in a Canon for under [money]. Even better -- standard AA batteries so you'll never have to worry about your battery pack being depleted with no options or having your batteries become irreplaceable after a few years. IT takes video too and the 320 x 240 videos are usable, cute, and a nice additional feature. The ease of use is excellent. And best of all the vivid quality of the images combined with the sharpness left me impressed. I didn't need to refer to the manual during first use to get started. Very simple. Need to read to understand all the features.UPDATE:Most of the few bad reviews that drag down the rating of this camera are due to the common misperception that using regular AA batteries is the norm. READ THE MANUAL PEOPLE! ALL cameras are the same in this regard and everyone will tell you to BUY RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES. Yes, they make a HUGE difference. I have a set of 1850mAh which will easily last me 125+ shots with the LCD on, reviewing the photos, etc. What is great is that this camera CAN use standard AAs if you are in a jam, one of its greatest assets. The picture quality is superb for the most part. Like all other cameras, autofocus is not perfect but it is very good and many of the pictures have just overwhelmed people who see my work. There are numerous other features that this camera offers and for 4 megapixels, the options and the price, this camera is a total steal. It feels good to grip in the hand. For some this camera might be a tad large and slightly heavier but you get quality photos which is the bottom line. Get a tiny camera you'll get much lower battery life and picture quality. Make your decision regarding the trade off. Having seen the pictures from this camera I would easily have paid more.", "Date": "April 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Limited features", "Author": "scott \"scott\"", "ReviewID": "R39Q6LI3EEO3WF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned two other digital cameras, this was to be a replacement for a dead 3.2MP Casio QV300EX. I am a point-and-shooter primarily, but like to have the controls when I feel creative. If all you want is an auto setting camera, you can do much worse. However, if you are at all interested in manual control, look elsewhere!The bad:1. Only two aperature settings2. Lens does NOT zoom when in Macro mode3. In manual mode, the LCD does NOT display the focus. The user is expected to view the focus as a number displayed on the LCD, i.e. 0.6m, etc. This makes it impossible to get the correct focus in manual mode.4. Has problems in low light getting a good focus. My test photos were blury in evening light, the kind of light that makes for some of the best photos. This is probably due to the relatively slow lens.5. Lacks shutter priority mode. Come on!6. Battery door seems fragile and is hard to close. The tabs that lock it into place seem to be stuck when sliding the door, I'm afraid over time they would break.7. Too easily turned-on while in the pocket/bag.The good:1. Solid metal case2.

A very good fried of mine has the S404 and loves it. I consider myself an advanced photographer that has been fighting off the digital craze. Until now 35mm is had been dear to me but the instant gratification of digital is amazing. I am very happy with the manual settings that let me be creative. The auto setting also takes very good pictures. My 10 year old daughter has no problems in taking nice shots. I would recommend NiMh batteries and at least a 128 meg CF card.

I researched features, prices, accessories and customer satisfaction for just about every camera this size (4 MP) and without ever physically holding the camera, purchased the Minolta DiMAGE S414 from Amazon.  The first hard lesson I learned was that this camera barely functions without Monster's Ultra-High Capacity batteries (2000 mAh).  Invest the extra fifty bucks for a set of four rechargeable Monsters and the rapid charger and you will be so glad you did.  I upgraded to a 256MB CF card for seventy bucks and will never fill the thing to its capacity, even on a week-long vacation.  My husband is a novice to digital photography, but took to the DiMAGE like a fish to water and is so pleased with the ease-of-use and quality of it.  The photos are spectacular.  We have logged such events as our daughter's first ballet recital, our annual beach vacation, and even 4th of July fireworks with most pleasing results.  We will be taking a trip to the Caribbean in October and while I am hesitant to travel with my new toy, I would be foolish not to take it along.  The colors are crisp, the details *amazing*, and if you take the time to read the short manual and research the features before using the camera, you will be in love with the DiMAGE.  The camera itself is chunky and professional looking, easy to hold and even take one-handed photos if necessary.  The \"movie with sound\" feature is cute, although the files are typically too large for email to the grandparents. I use my DiMAGE in combination with HP's Photosmart 7350, which I found at Staples (refurbished) for under a hundred bucks, and found that HP's printer software compliments the package nicely with automatic photo reduction for email, super easy red-eye removal and very professional quality photos on any type of photo paper (the 4x6's are amazing.)  I have read every review posted about this model camera and with enough detailed research, you can resolve most problems.  Probably not a good camera for the electronically challenged.  I recommend this camera without hesitation.", "Date": "September 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "good value", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3H90L4NSNF9UU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought 3 sets of panasonic rechargeable batteries (1950 mA) from the local warehouse store and they lasted most of a day.  They are an affordable alternative to the monster rechargeable batteries mentioned in other reviews and it seems that 2 sets would have been enough.  I bought a 256mb compact flash card and a sandisk usb card reader.  For all of you new to digital photography (like I am), the camera is pretty much useless until you have purchased all of these.I can say that the camera compares well to my Canon Z135 35mm.  For a digital camera, it is a bit on the large and heavy side, but I'm ok with that.  I've found the 60 seconds of movie quite useful (in daytime outdoors and bright light only) especially when I saw dolphins in the ocean.  I couldn't get a still shot because I never knew when the dolphins would go above water, so at least I was able to get a clip.Also, I was unable to get a shot in medium light (indoor pool) conditions, (using the flash, the subject was fine, but the background wasn't, without the flash, the background was good, but the subject wasn't, using the fill flash was slightly better) but I'm not sure my Canon would have got the picture any better.I've found the camera to do very well, for indoor portraits and outdoor (bright sun) landscapes.I'm not happy with the date stamp feature, because it removes part of the picture (maybe there is a setting to change the way it puts the date stamp?)I also don't like the way it does red eye reduction.  It does 3 flashes, and the third is when the picture is actually taken, but after the first (no matter how many times you tell them) the subject believes that the shot was taken and stops posing.Digital photography is great for beginners because you can immediately see what you are doing wrong and correct it.", "Date": "September 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great value for a 4 megapixel camera", "Author": "C.

It was a gift for my wife since I preferred camcorders. But lately my camcorder stays at home while I'm looking around with this camera for the perfect motive. After about 5.000 shots I rate this product as follows:Pro* uses AA: You get `em everywhere and the rechargeable NiMH are inexpensive. ( No hidden cost in sometimes very spendy special batteries other manufactures use).* the same about the Compact Flash Card. Here you get the best bang (MB)for the buck among all Flash Memory. (Go and compare XD or Sony Memory stick...).* 4x optical is no standard in this price class* solid metal body* fast internal memory enables this camera to take 5-7 consecutive shots - very fast. After that it takes about 20 sec. until the camera is ready to shoot again.* has Aperture priority, Shutter prior., and Manual. Manual conrols Shutter, Aperture, ISO, and you can focus if you want. Maybe I should mention this under Cons, but I mainly use the Manual mode since I feel that the Automatic mode often doesn't get the right setting.* good Macro, gets you up to about 6inches from the object. I came to realize that getting close the autofocus is often inaccurate and so I swithc to manual focusing.* with 4 Mb you can magnify and still keep impressiv detail.* I love the LCD not only for \"what you see is what you get\" but also for it very helpfull impression how the exposure of the picture will look like.* I used to have a SLR and couldn't shoot slower than 1/60 in my hand. With this one I was able to get very nice 1/15 out of my hand.* produces clear and lively colors - I prefer the Vivid color mode.Cons:* The camera turns itself on when you push it into the bag. I learned to avoid this problem by pushing it into the bag with the wider side of the camera (battery compartment) first. That way the mode wheel will be turned towards the OFF position, and ON when you pull it out of the bag which isn't really a problem.Unless you don't use this trick you will turn the camera accidently ON while it is in the bag. The camera tries to extract the lenses and it hangs up. To get it running again you have to open the battery compartment which will reset the camera.* when I download the pictures on my PC (XP) I'm using the standard picture watching tool in the explorer. This tool gives you the option to turn pictures vertically. This will erase the information about how the picture was taken in the software that came with this camera, the DimageViewer. Very often the Dimage Viewer hangs up when I try to open a folder, with pictures turned vertically. This problem occured on all 3 of my PCs. Migth as well be a problem of XP, but just that you know what might affect your Dimager Viewer.* The focusing in dim light condition is horrible. The LCD doesn't let you know that the picture is blurry, until you find out later on the PC monitor. Manual focusing helps it.* battery drains in about 1 h, with LCD and permanent autofocus on.* a little bit more clumsy compared to other models.* no possibility to adjust flash / no chance to use flash in closeups, beyond 8 feet it becomes useless. I`m using my fingers in front of the flash light to adjust intensity.* the door from the battery compartment looks somewhat shaky to me but the overall impression is that you have a piece of quality in your hand. A nice Point and Shoot camera. Exceptional value for the money.

I bought a Viking 256 meg card that can store from 20 to 800+ images depending on the image size and quality. I also purchased a memory reader which makes managing photos easy.  I am using Windows 98, and the camera, card reader and memory cards are all working flawlessly.  The connection is via the usb port, and I had to install the driver (a couple minutes) for the card reader.  I did not install the Minolta cd, I already have some freeware to manage image files.

I've had the camera about a month now and haven't begun to test the limits f the camera.  My criteria included 3-4 mega pixel, 3-4X optical zoom, reputable manufacturer, a menu system the was easy to navigate and a unit that felt good in the hands.The camera I looked at included the Canon A70, Fuji FinePix 3800 and the Olympus C-4000 all met my basic criteria.  All had the mega pixels and optical zoom I was looking for.  I also wanted a camera that used the more popular media formats (compactflash or smartmedia) for price and availability reasons.  The Canon caused me brief pause because it uses a proprietary battery and I wanted to be able to use AA alkaline batteries if a got caught short on power.These are all camera manufacturers that numerous reviews speak highly of.  I've owned or used a couple of Minolta products (SLRs) in the past and thought they were very good for my purposes.The menu system on the Minolta took a little while to understand but it wasn't bad particularly once I spent a little time working with the camera and the manual in hand.The camera feels good in your hands, which was one of the criteria I had for a camera.  Part of this criteria included the ability to handle the camera in one hand and if need be snap a shot that way. I upgraded the flashcard immediately which I'd recommend to anyone really wanting to use this camera at its limits (the 16MB is only good for 7 shots).  A 256MB card gave me some room to play even a 4MB per shot.The only items that caused me some concern were the stated battery life (from other reviews of other Minolta models) and the software bundle.  On the first item, I really haven't had much to complain about.  I purchased rechargeable NiMH (1800mA) batteries with the camera and they've provided 30-50 shots depending on use (flash, previewing shots etc.).  On the second count I was disappointed but I must admit I didn't go in with high expectation.  Most cameras are sold with limited or LE (light) versions of software.  This Minolta was no exception.

People who post otherwise aren't using the camera with optimal settings.  The only flaw in the camera is that it very occasionally has an out of focus shot.  Here are tips to use this camera correctly.1) Turn off all sounds on the custom1 menu of the setup mode and while your at it set the LCDbrightness setting to 3 under the basic menu.  A set of 2300mAh rechargable batteries will last approx. 200 shots (say 100 with flash) if all sounds (shutter, warning etc.) are turned off.  Otherwise you'll only get 50 or so.2)  Only use manual mode.  Automatic mode tries to guess what object you are focusing on and sometimes guesses wrong.  I use spot metering.  In manual mode you set the focus to be the object in the center of the frame, lock the focus by holding the button down half-way, move the camera to frame the shot as you wish and then press the button down the remaining bit to take a shot --- just like every other camera I've used in the last 20 years.  It's unlikely that you would ever want auto mode anyway.  Manual mode uses reasonable default settings and you can change them if you wish, unlike auto mode.3) If lighting is a bit strange, use the manual white-balance feature.  It works even if you are using flash.I have taken several thousand pictures with this camera over the past year and am very impressed with the quality of the lens and the sensor.  If you go to steves-digicams.com and imaging-resource.com and compare the photos taken by this camera with other 4mp cameras you'll see what I mean.

I can see how you might easily pay more for less and more for more, so you really need to determine what you're going to use it for, how often, and what your skill level is.  I think this one is a less for more value.  For the price, the 4MP is excellent.  Unles you are going to be making professional large prints, I don't really think you need anything bigger.  For average printing, this is fine; better than fine for strictly electronic viewing.  The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is two-fold:  Manual focus is difficult and I haven't been able to figure it out yet.  And, I can usually figure out anything.  Also, I read a review that said the camera \"loses\" pictures in downloading directly from the camera, but the pictures aren't \"lost\" if you use a card reader.  Darned if that isn't right.  I didn't lose any pictures, but pictures I know I deleted from the camera I found on the card when I used a reader.  I don't find this at all bothersome because I was going to use a reader anyway to both reduce wear on the camera and to occasionally use the card as a jump drive for my PC.I really like the fact that it uses regular AA batteries instead of some odd proprietary battery, so in a pinch you can operate the camera with a quick trip to 7-11, but I can tell you they last for fewer than 20 flashes.  I bought with my camera, and recommend, the Kodak charger with 1850 rechargeable batteries.  I researched that as well, and found most people prefer the Kodak batteries and the charger ramps them up in three hours, and they last a LONG time.  I haven't found it necessary to get a second set of batteries, but it's probably a good idea.  To complete my camera outfit I bought a 256MB card, which will hold over 300 images in standard mode, and 1000 on economy.

The CPU flies.  The flash is strong and far-reaching.  The LCD is a little small but the camera is a little bulky so who knows what it could have been with a giant LCD.  It would not accept my 128MB flash card so that was a disappointment.  The manual just tells that if the error message appears that you can't use the card.  I can't say as of yet why.  But I would warn against buying older CF.  I really think this product is great overall and I bought one for my friends and they are leaping with joy.  Do yourself a favor and go to where it is being sold and get it in your hand and see if you can handle its size and feel.  If so, you have in your hand a really full-featured camera for the price.", "Date": "May 28, 2003"}, {"Title": "What an awefull junk", "Author": "Mark Twain \"S-L\"", "ReviewID": "R2XV8TTPHCE469", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera wishing to move with digital age. I am a film camera user for the last 5 years and this one is my first digital camera in last two years.As usual Amazon did a great job in shipping my order in a timely manner, before the expeted delivery date. Thanks amazon.The camera itself was the surprise. I bought it after spending hours reading and searching for the best value/performance data in several forums and decided to go for it. So I am going to tell you what I liked most,Pros:- Good construction, made of alluminium. Picture quality is quite good (not that great as lot of reviewers mentioned here). My old Olympus C-211 2.1mpx took much better photos at ISO 100 than this one.4x zoom with 4 megapixel sensor, video recording with sound, manual focussing and lots of controls (most of them are useless at the end, I will talk about them later) and use of cheap CF card makes it a very attractive camera for film converts. Additionally I purchased a nice leather (fake) case for the camera as a lot users reported that the camera gets \"Turned On\" by itself while seating inside a pocket. The camera is relatively big, so I feel much easier to handhold it, always good for film converts. I never expected some of the surprising features like spot metering, live histogram and tiff file shooting in such an inexpensive camera.CONS:- Everything aside what I mentioned above. Picture quality, I don't know how good it is compared to others, but to me simply acceptable when comapre photos from my 3 year old C-211. Noise is much better controlled than my old camera though, but ISO 400 is equally unusable. I took most of my test shots at ISO 64 and 100.the real drawback of this camera is focussing. Even in normal daylight it miss autofocus like a moron. You will have no clue as you shoot. It will beep indicating autotofocus, looking at the LCD is a pure pain...all blurred image. Remember I am not a newbie and I know how to handhold a camera and mionimize shaking.Low light autofocus is even more pathetic....it's more like tossing a coin in the air.there is an option of manual focussing, but hey..I better use a 10 year old film camera if I have to use manual focussing for 50% of my shots.LCD screen is although quite big fo rthe price, is again not useful as it does not have any antiglare coating, so in outdoors you are pretty much stuck upon your luck.Video quality is nothing great..choppy at the best. Sound quality is also at best choppy.Another starange problem is heat build up. After 15 minutes of continuous use it becomes quite hot (not wram) around the battery compartment area. Should be good in midwest cold, huh!S414 is quite slow when it comes to write tiff files to the CF card and a better (I used a 80X lexar pro card) wont improve this fact. So DO NOT waste money on a faster card if you ever buy this camera (hope you will not do that). At the end I must mention the poor quality of power consumption. My 1800MAh batteries last for two card ( 128x2MB) loads of photos and I believe this is not at par with most of the recent cameras in the market.Supplied software is also just avarage..dont expect a lot out of it.So my conclusion:- Stay away if you can. Buy it if you have to go digital and you absolutely need a 4 MPX camera with 4x optical zoom.", "Date": "October 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good with some limitations", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R29RULL7RBPKMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A solid camera, fairly easy to use (you really need to read the manual for some features), and pretty flexible when you learn how to use the features.  I'm an amatuer photographer, so I'm limited in my price range, but from what I've seen it's a good deal.  I did however notice some complaints from other reviews that aren't valid:1 - No shutter priority mode: there actually is, in manual mode.  Necessary for shooting things such as sunsets.2 - Poor functionality in low light: I have taken some great low light/non-flash shots by adjusting the ASA. The quality degrades a little, but that parallels film usage. 3 - Short battery life: This can easily be avoided by not using the LCD.  I've shot 120 frames of hi-res at my daughters soccer games on one set of rechargeables.  The LCD is useless in bright sun anyway.Things I like:* Compact size, good feel in the hand* Solid built, the memory card door and battery door on mine are rock solid.* Flexibility - BW, Sepia, Enchanced color, Custom white balance, adjustable ASA, different metering modes, adjustable auto shut off, adjustable playback* Picture quality - I've printed out some great 8 x 10's.* Continuous shooting - very handy at sporting events for capturing action sequencesThings I don't like:* Lag time in AutoFocus - takes a while before you hear the little *ding*.  It's easy to push the shutter halfway, watch the lens focus and take the picture before the *ding*, which usually results in an out of focus picture.  I use manual mode for anything that requires a faster response time.* On/off switch is too easily switched on accidently.* Will ocassionally (not too often) lock-up and you need to re-boot by removing the batteries.* Lack of gradual digital zoom* What you see in the viewfinder is slightly zoomed in from what is actually framed in the picture.  Easy to fix in editing, but still...* Video clip functionality - it works OK, but I never use it.  Would rather have a gradual digital zoom.One negative observation - my camera is 6 months old, and the main control button (zoom/select) is getting harder to push in to select something.  Frustrating when I'm flipping through menu settings in a hurry.This has been a good intro to digital photography, but my next camera will have to go up a step to switchable lenses (for a larger zoom) and higher pixel resolution.", "Date": "October 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Disappointed...traded for the Canon S230", "Author": "J. Lo \"jl\"", "ReviewID": "R3BVNCQL0Z5IMN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After reading all the wonderful reviews from various websites and here, I bought the S414 and how disappointing...1. Terrible focusing.  In autofocus mode, about 30% of the photos come out to be somewhat fuzzy.  I did everything according to the manual, even using the focus rectangles but the pictures still come out unfocused.  This happens both indoor and outdoor.  Maual focusing is even worse.  You need to view the image on the LCD screen for manual focusing.  Since the screen is small, it is very difficult to determine if the image is focused.  Under the sun, you can hardly see images on the LCD screen, so manual focusing is nearly impossible.  2. Picture quality is not acceptable.  The pictures are often flat and unlively.  Colors are not as vivid as I would hope.  The date stamp makes the picture looks very unprofessional, since it looks like a large white label instead of having just numeric values.  The numbers show up as blocks instead of having smooth edges.3. Bulky and heavy.  The size and weight of this camera makes it really difficult to carry around.  In order to carry this, I have the wrap it around my neck, making it really difficult to do anything else without it pounding against my chest.  4. Boot up time is long.  I had missed a few good pictures simply because it takes longer for this camera to boot up than it takes others.  5. Definitely not a point-and-shoot.  This camera is not meant to used as a point-and-shoot camera.  It takes way to long to boot and focus.  By the time you're ready to take a picture, you would've missed the shot.  Not really suitable for people who want to capture spontaneous shots.6. Overdone flash.  The flash cannot seem to readjust for different objects.  It's too bright even for subjects that are upto 2 feet from the lens.  Many of my pictues end up being too bright and unfixable even using the bundled software.  At times, the flash doesn't even come on when there is backlight.  I guess most cameras have flash that don't, but my Canon S230 and Kodak DX4900 does adjust to accomodate so I get great pictures even when there is backlight.7. Odd size lens.  The len's diameter is at an odd 35.5mm.  It is very difficult to find anyone carrying filters of this size cheap.  You may want to consider this if you intend to use any filters for this camera.In my opinion, this camera is over-rated.  Although the price is quite affordable for a 4MP and 4X zoom camera, I would rather pay a bit extra to own a 3.2MP/2X zoom Canon.  The picture quality of the Canon S230 I own, which has 3.2MP, is way better than this camera.  The fact that I can focus 90% of the time with my S230 makes it much better than the S414, not to mention the size difference.  If you're not looking to print pictures greater than 11\"x14\", a 3.2MP is more than sufficient.  One important factor is that my S230 is Made in Japan.  The S414 is Made in China.  From my previous experiences with numerous electronic, gadgets that are Made in Japan are far far better in quality than those made in China.

But out of maybe 200 photos, I might have taken two that were keepers.  Problems -I think the worst problem I had was color accuracy.  Sunlit pictures had a funny yellow tint, a cloudy day produced truly cold colors.  When I used the White Balance settings to correct, the colors over-compensated.  Autofocus was less than spectacular.  In lower light, with or without flash, autofocus did not work correctly.  The manual focus is impossible to use effectively, because it only works in increments - you have to know what the exact distance is between the camera and the subject, then set it.  There are three settings for sharpness.  Even on the highest setting, I didn't get the same sharpness as I did from my almost 3-year-old 2-megapixel camera.  I have to admit, I did like the exposure preview on the LCD screen when I set apertures and shutter speeds in manual mode.

It's fairly simple to use but even after figuring it out there just seems to be too many submenus to go through just to change one setting. So if you need to change the setting to capture the picture you want at the right moment, you better have fast hands/fingers. Battery life is pretty typical.. not very good. For me, the camera is pretty large for being considered a point-and-shoot (I believe it is, but not sure) and not an SLR, but it really depends on what you consider small/large. It comes with a neck strap that connects to both ends of the camera, so that may say something about the size. It's not very portable and it can feel quite heavy after it's been hanging from your neck for awhile.

When you carry this camera it is constantly turning on and off every time you bump it, or it brushes against your clothes.--It is slow to focus which makes it difficult to get any spontaneous or action pictures.--Its abilities are only the equavalent of 400 speed film. It is difficult to take any photos in low light situations. I have seen other digital cameras that are much better at this.--It takes 4 AA bateries, and goes through them very fast. I have the rechargeable ones that are recommended and even with those, I  can only use the camera for about 4 to 6 hours before I have to change them.

The old one was fine, just way too bulky for normal everyday use. If you leave the camera home because it's too heavy to slip into a pocket, it doesn't matter how good the camera is.Unfortunately, I didn't see any customer reviews at the time of my purchase that let me know how bulky this camera is, so it was quite a surprise to take this big brick of a camera out of the box when it arrived. It's even thicker than the old Kodak, so I can't even fit it into the old carrying pouch I used for the old one.In addition, the camera strap isn't just a small wrist string, but a big, around-the-neck strap. More bulk.If you look at the product photo, you'll see a small dial on the top back edge of the camera. That's the on/off dial. Since it's on the edge, it's very easy to bump the dial into \"on\" position when you're putting the camera into a carrying case or a (very large) pocket. The battery door is also very flimsy, and I suspect the life of the battery door will determine the life of the camera. The lens cap doesn't pop off when the camera's turned on, so a new user (perhaps someone else at the party) is likely to pick it up, turn it on, look through the little view window, and snap a few photos of the inside of the lens cap.When I use the camera, it has odd focusing issues. It has difficulty focusing sometimes. For example, it often leaves a group of people posing awkwardly, while the camera lens goes back and forth and back and forth and back and forth...and the final image might show the group out of focus, but a tree somewhere in the background in perfect focus.It also can't take photos from close range, less than about 18 inches. I tried to take a photo of a small receipt I was submitting to my health insurance company, since I don't have a scanner. It took about ten photos before I got one in focus. I had to pull the camera way back from the receipt, then zoom all the way forward. And boy, does this camera eat batteries. Don't even think of going away from home overnight without bringing your battery charger and a set of spares. It uses four AA batteries, so consider the additional bulk of the charger and spares if you often take many photos in between uploads to your computer.On the positive side, image quality is great, if you manage to get a photo properly focused. No distortion at the edges of the frame, just perfect images (provided the focus is right). Also, saving time to the CompactFlash card is really fast, so you can snap away with photo after photo, without that embarrassing \"everyone hold that pose a little longer, the camera's saving the last photos\" explanation.I'm living overseas, so my 30-day guarantee from Amazon expired around the time I received the camera. I wish I'd ordered it on a US trip, so I could have returned it right away and bought a more compact model. I'm stuck with it now, but I suspect I'll be buying another camera within the next year or so, when I get tired of lugging this thing around.UPDATE FROM JANUARY 2004: The camera stopped working entirely and wouldn't take any more photos. I went to the Minolta.com website to find where to take the camera for warranty service, now that I'm back in the US.

I bought this digital camera (my first) last Sept.,2004 after much checking, prices & features from several sources and I thought I made a good choice. Afterall I had a Minolta Maxxum 7000 35mm and was quite pleased with it. However this DiMage 414 was as bad a choice as I have ever made in my life, including my first wife. I got several AA NiMH rechargeable batteries and chargers which worked well but this camera ate batteries. When I took it somewhere to take shots I had to take several sets of recharged batteries along. I actually purchased slim plastic battery carriers to stuff in the oversized camera bag I was forced to buy to accomadate them,Konica Minolta is too cheap to include a bag or case. Now as of this date I am looking for a replacement camera for this wonderfull Konica Monolta Dimage 414 gem which stopped working completely recently. A lesson learned. To anyone even thinking about buying this camera: Please save yourself money and frustration by NOT buying this camera-buy something else, take it from one who learned the hard way. You don't suppose that when Minolta merged with Konica their products became subpar?", "Date": "June 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "Bad Camera..Too Bulky.", "Author": "Vivek Shah", "ReviewID": "R3OMINPX0C53CS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera just a month ago and I didn't have any major problems with it apart from it's huge size and weight. But in this little time, it's LCD has stopped working!!The camera would start but the LCD wont. Just imagine you buy a new camera and in just a month's time,it stops working.Now I need to ship it to Minolta's Service Center and will have to bear a lot of Shipping charges. And I have a lot of precious occasions upcoming and will be missing them without my camera.Also it drains the batteries like hell.With 4 batteries, actually the camera should be able to work for longer duration but it's the other way.Moreover it's too slow in focusing.

I called Minolta and was told that I need to send it to them (and pay shipping) and they will check and decide what to do (even though the technician seemed familiar with the problem).

Even in Auto everything, half of my pictures came out blurry.  I took a series of shots with the self timer to experiment with the focus.  Not one of them turned out.No matter what I tried, only half of the first 100 or so shots I took turned out.This camera was so bad I hope that something was wrong with it.

The price is alsogreat.So why do I give it 1 star?  This camera eats batterieslike CRAZY!  I don't mean it gets annoying after a while,it gets annoying right away.  I tried several goodrecharageables, and I still run out of batteries after about20 pictures.  Once the batteries die, the lense won't close.that's a problem when you're walking around.

Here's why...:1. This camera is very bulky compared with almost any camera (for the same resolution) out there in the market. Since this camera is not available for display in popular electronic stores, you really cannot hold it in your hand and get a feel for it BEFORE you buy it. I like my camera to be slim and small. Else I don't feel like carrying it with me when I ought to. What then is the point of buying a camera?2. This camera is power hungry!. It sucks the juice out of the batteries in no time. I find myself changing batteries all the time. And yes, I do use NiMH batteries as the manufacturer reccomends. Talking of replacing batteries, the battery compartment door looks pretty flimsy and doesn't lock very well. I have a premonition that this door is going to dictate the life of this camera.3.
