{"Reviews": [{"Title": "E-M5 review from a previous PEN owner", "Author": "Michael Gakuran", "ReviewID": "R35YJ5T32FX1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been invested in the m43 format since the launch of the E-P1 in summer 2009, successively moving up to the E-PL2, E-P3 and now the OM-D E-M5. Features have been added and the cameras tweaked with each generation, and it's safe to say that Olympus have produced their best m43 camera yet in the E-M5. But there is a lot of competition out there, and the robust E-M5 with built-in electronic viewfinder (EVF) may not be the best option for everyone. Let me walk you through my experience using the camera having upgraded from past models. (Note I'm based in Japan, which is why I have the camera early).[Size and Weight]My initial reason for choosing the mirrorless m43 (micro four thirds) format was a desire to have a high quality imaging sensor inside a compact camera body. I did not want to carry around the bulk and weight of a DSLR camera, but was tired of the poor performance from point and shoot cameras, especially in low light. The Olympus PEN series met my needs perfectly in this respect, and have retained their small form factor throughout the range, despite consistently improving and adding features.The E-M5 is no exception - it is the same width as the E-P3, with a little extra height because of the EVF on top of the camera and 50g heavier, weighing in at 425g with battery. In pictures online, it can look rather large, but after holding the camera in my hands, it became clear just how small it really is. The E-M5 is certainly not a pocket camera (although it will fit into large coat pockets), but the form-factor and equally small, lightweight m43 lenses mean it is an excellent choice for hiking and travelling, especially if you value its robust body and weather sealing.[Build Quality]The E-M5 boasts a tough magnesium alloy shell and weather sealing. Videos posted online showing the camera having water poured on it and shooting out in the rain are testament to its high quality construction, although do note that `splash-proof' is not `water-proof'. You probably shouldn't submerge the camera in water, and note too, that you'll need weather-sealed lenses to fully utilise the benefits (as of today, only the 12-50mm kit lens is weather-sealed, with a 60mm weather-sealed macro lens on the way).The camera has a lovely heft to it when held in the hand and suitably good grip - certainly heavier than most point and shoot cameras, but lighter than most DSLR cameras. In contrast to the PEN cameras, the E-M5 has a slightly protruding thumb `hook' on the back that really aids stability, as well as a nice grip (with the option of an external grip and additional battery holder available separately to help when using larger lenses).[Functionality]The biggest departure from the previous PEN models is undoubtedly the bult-in EVF and two dials on top of the camera. The EVF is similar to the VF-2 that Olympus sold separately to complement the PEN cameras and provides a bright and useful display. For users who like viewfinders, this is a long-awaited addition and most people will not be disappointed. The 100% field-of-view 1.15x EVF is, as current technology goes, one of the best (although the magnification is not as good as the GH-2 EVF with 1.42x, providing a larger image).The two dials on top of the camera allow access to various functions, but most people will use them to change the aperture, shutter and exposure compensation. You can also assign functions such as manual mode or focus zoom to one of 3 function buttons on the camera. The rear control pad is also customisable, meaning it is finally possible to access all of the main settings without having to dive into the detailed menu system.One of the most pleasing things for me was finally being able to use the camera while wearing gloves (something I could not do easily with the previous PEN cameras). Although it can still be difficult to use the rear control pad while wearing gloves, the main settings assigned to the dials and function buttons are easily useable. Another little tweak that I love is the offset tripod mount (to accommodate for the additional grip the E-M5 is able to use). This means that I can now change the battery while the camera is mounted to a tripod plate. Thumbs up!The 9fps shooting speed mentioned is without AF and IBIS turned on, but it's certainly a welcome addition over previous PEN models. I've used it for bracketing shots when creating HDR photos. You can shoot a maximum of 7 photos in bracketing mode to capture the dynamic range of the scene and then combine them later in software. Using the 9fps speed, this is done in an instant, and it may even make handheld HDR bracketing possible. It's also worth noting that the E-M5 is compatible with 3rd party intervalometers such as the JJC TM-J that support the Olympus RM-UC1 remote to do timelapse shooting.[Autofocus Speed]The m43 cameras have made incredible progress in improving autofocus speed since their initial launch and are far better than the sluggish focus of the original E-P1. Previous Panasonic cameras like the GH-2 held the crown, but in the latest generation of PEN cameras and with the new OM-D line, autofocus speed matches the Panasonic models and even surpasses it in some tests. The bottom line is that the E-M5 can hold its own against consumer DSLRs in autofocus speeds, with perhaps two caveats: 1) that AF slows down in low light and 2) that AF tracking when shooting sports is still not quite as good as DSLR rivals. That said, the E-M5 has some big improvements in this area, and can quite reasonably track moving objects while shooting at a respectable 4fps.[Sensor and Noise Performance]One of the bigger criticisms of the E-P3 and other PEN cameras was the ageing 12MP sensor inside the camera. While it was still perfectly good for shooting at lower ISOs, its performance suffered when moving up, especially beyond ISO1600. The Panasonic GH-2 arguably had the best noise performance of a m43 camera up until now, but the E-M5 can be said to claim this crown. A new 16MP sensor inside the camera offers about 1 - 1.5 'stops' of improvement in noise performance. Basically this means that if you thought ISO1600 on the previous PEN cameras was acceptable, you will likely be happy with ISO3200 on the E-M5.As usual, Olympus offer lovely Jpegs with gorgeous colours straight out of the camera for users who do not like to post-process their images in software. But for users who do, the Raw files offer more flexibility and noticeably increased dynamic range over previous PEN cameras (also about 1 - 1.5 'stops' improvement), allowing highlights and shadows to be pulled back. Practically speaking this means less white skies and richer colours! Noise is also very well controlled and easily reduced in software afterwards.[In-Body Image Stabilisation (IBIS)]The image stabilisation built into the camera body is, in my opinion, one of the strongest reasons for considering the PEN line or OM-D line over other mirrorless cameras like the Sony NEX series or Panasonic cameras. The previous IBIS system built into the PEN cameras was already good, but Olympus have found a way to improve it even further. Marketing tells us it's a 5-axis IBIS system that constantly stabilises the sensor, and indeed it does. You can see it kick in as the sensor moves into position when you power on the camera.The biggest area this offers improvement in is the video mode (although naturally, still shots also benefit). The E-P3 was notorious for its rolling shutter and jellylike wobble when it received even the slightest bump. The E-M5 and its new IBIS system completely removes this wobble and significantly reduces the rolling shutter effect. What this means is that you can take very smooth videos handheld, so much so that you might even have been mistaken for using a steadicam in some cases. It isn't a substitute for a steadicam however, and walking with the camera will still introduce a minor amount of image `shifting' as the sensor compensates for the movement. But handheld panning and careful walking with the camera is as smooth as could be.[Touchscreen]One of the most interesting and pleasing features of my E-P3 was the capacitive touchscreen. Perfectly implemented with just 3 `modes' - off, on to focus, or on to focus and take picture. Some might view this feature as a gimmick, but I found it exceptionally useful. Rather than focus and recompose the shot like in traditional cameras, you can simply compose your shot and lightly touch the screen to focus on your desired area and take the shot. I found it very useful for macro work, as well as general shooting when out with friends. The E-M5 continues this feature, and the beautiful OLED screen works like a charm.[Lens Selection]Another reason I chose the m43 format (supported by Olympus and Panasonic, as well as other 3rd party makers) over competing cameras such as the Sony NEX series is the large selection of lenses available. This still continues to be the case. Using a bright prime lens such as the Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 and coupled with the improved high ISO noise performance, I find the E-M5 to be formidable in low light. (If you are on a budget, consider the equally-excellent Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 pancake lens or Olympus 45mm f/1.8 portrait lens).It obviously will not match a full frame sensor's performance, but the difference between the E-M5 sensor and the larger APS-C sized sensors like the one in the Sony NEX series is very small. A larger sensor means better noise performance (cleaner pictures), but a smaller sensor means smaller and lighter-weight lenses can be made for the camera. All things considered, I find the m43 system to provide the best balance between all these factors, with the E-M5 and GH-2 providing the best sensor performance among m43 cameras.[Criticisms]I do not have any serious criticisms of the camera, but rather a few niggling complaints that I will list below.- The camera makes a low fan-like/humming noise when switched on that is audible in quiet environments. This is normal and a result of the always-on new IBIS system. Most users will not be able to hear it in regular shooting. Also note that the noise is lowered and essentially gone when in video mode, meaning it does not affect video. However, it is worth noting as many will be surprised when first turning the camera on and it may prove annoying for some people who shoot often in quiet environments.- The position of the viewfinder and small size of the camera mean that for left-eyed shooters, you may find your nose slightly squashed against your thumb when holding the camera. If concerned about this, it would be best to check at a store first. I found using my right eye avoided this problem.- No built-in flash. Although an extra mini flash unit is provided in the box, users who value having a flash built into the camera body may be disappointed. I used to value this feature until I realised I rarely use the built-in flash at all (and quite often it isn't powerful enough to improve pictures). For those occasions where I need a flash however, I can take the little flash unit with me.- New battery. The battery used is not the same as previous PEN cameras, meaning you'll need to buy replacement batteries (I take 2 spares on a heavy day's shoot). Olympus are usually good with this though, and I think we can expect the new battery will be used across the OM-D line in future models.- High cost and lots of customisability. This isn't really a negative so much as a realistic assessment. For many point and shoot upgraders, the E-M5 may be more than you need. Indeed, the camera is larger than other PEN models and offers lots of flexibility to customise controls (meaning the menus are suitably packed with features). Although you can just use the camera in P or iAuto mode, you can find much cheaper PEN cameras that will still offer great image quality in a smaller package. For those who want the best possible image quality and value the EVF and extra controls, the E-M5 will not disappoint.[Final Thoughts]I've never owned a m43 Panasonic camera myself, so it would be unfair of me to compare the E-M5 to the GH-2 (its nearest competitor), but for the image quality I've seen online, the two cameras are close, with the edge for the E-M5. You may also find the Panasonic G-3 a cheaper alternative that offers competitive image quality. Similarly, the Sony NEX cameras such as the NEX-5N and the Fuji XPro1 will give you better image quality than m43 cameras, but at the expense of a wide-ranging and small lens selection and at the expense of functionality.There isn't a great deal I'm left wanting from the E-M5. Perhaps faster AF tracking for sports and full speed AF support for older 43 lenses when used with an adapter (there does not seem to have been much improvement here between the E-P3 and E-M5). Also, 1/8000 second max shutter speed and ISO 100 (the range begins at ISO200, like previous PEN models) would be welcome. A mic-out port for monitoring video using external headphones and 24p mode would also be nice.It will be exciting to see what Olympus can innovate next to improve upon the camera. But for the time being, I feel happy awarding it 5 stars when compared to other cameras within the same class. If you feel the niggling faults are serious however, feel free to subtract one.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing little wonder", "Author": "A. Stegeman", "ReviewID": "R1Y0SP3TC5KEDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, who I am: I'm an avid street photographer who usually has 1-2 gallery showings a year and occaisionally gets my photos picked up by the papers--I've been into photography for alomost 50 years and teach it at the university level.  While I bought the camera with the 12-50mm kit lens, most of my shooting has been with the Panasonic/Leica 25mm f:1.4 lens, as I just prefer shooting with a fast, standard focal length, prime lens.  I'm just telling you this because some of the things that might wow me might be inconsequential to a novice photographer who just wants to point and shoot (although the camera does that as well).All of that out of the way, this camera is just plain nuts (in a good way).  Unless you're really splitting hairs, this tiny little camera can pull in virtually the same shots that a big, bulky, pro DSLR can.  Honest.  I've been getting stunning images in the most photographically problematic situations ever since I started shooting with this thing--If you don't believe me, go to [...] and do your own side by side comparisons.  Did I say it was small?  Not only can you carry it with you all day, but when you hold it in your hands you just know that the magesium frame is going to take all the abuse you can throw at it.  This camera doesn't just look like the legendary Olympus OM-1 & 2 cameras from the 1970's it's inheritted the very same strong and sveldt spirit which made them so appreciated by both professional photojournalists and enthusiasts.Aside from the size and image quality, this camera is also blistering fast with its autofocus--as in how can it do it that fast?  But as frosting on the cake, the auto zoom-in of the EVF when manually focussing makes going that route a snap, even for somebody with poor eyesight, like me--way beyond what one can do easily on a DSLR.  And while a mere 9 frames per second might just be so-so for a pro DSLR, it's plenty fast for more than 99% of the photographers out there. I could go on and on.The worst part of owning this camera now is that every day I have to look at well over $10,000 in my DSLR gear which I haven't touched since getting this mighy mite.If you're serious about photography and want a cary-with-you-anywhere-do-anything camera, and you can afford the serious money that Olympus is asking for this camera, just do it.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "From a Fujifilm X100 Owner: 1 Month Use", "Author": "E. Nguyen", "ReviewID": "RUYLOAYVP8P3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SIMPLY A JOY TO USEI took a leap of faith and sold my precious X100 to buy this camera. I've had the EM-5 for almost a month now and I just love it. To me it's almost the perfect camera.  I enjoy using it every time and it makes photography fun for me again.WHAT I WAS LOOKING FORA small lightweight camera with great versatility for outdoor hikes, indoor portraits and low light photography. The X100 was charming and produced beautiful OTC jpegs, but it did not have the versatility of an all-in-one camera that I was looking for to replace my DSLR. Focusing was too slow for taking pictures of my nieces or any action photography, focal length was not ideal for portraits or wild life shots, and video recording features were limited. It did excel at street photography but I wanted more.WHAT I FOUND IN THE EM-5Since you can change the lens, the possibilities are endless with the EM-5. Especially when paired with an exceptional lens like the Olympus 45mm or Panasonic 25mm, the Olympus can produce some breathtaking results. There are more controls and settings for movie recording. With lenses that feature MSC, zooming and focusing is absolutely silent. You can also add external mic input with an adapter and there are custom settings galore! It is more of an investment than the X100 with all the lenses but that depends on what you want out of it. IBIS let's me slow down the shutter speed to 1/20 of a second hand held so I don't have to stick to 1/60th and crank up the ISO.IMAGE QUALITYAlthough the EM-5 has a smaller the sensor, the image quality is very high. I would even say that the raw files from the EM-5 are equal or sometimes better than the X100. I still prefer the X100's beautiful jpeg engine but the EM-5 jpegs with noise reduction off and sharpening tone down are also superb. It's amazing how much detail you can get out of the raw files with the small 16MP sensor. I was initially worried that I would be sacrificing some image quality jumping into the EM-5 but my worries are non existent now. I don't hesitate cranking the ISO up to 6400 either, especially if I know it's not for prints. But do yourself a favor and get at least one tack sharp prime lens for the EM-5 (Olympus 12mm, 45mm, or Panasonic's 20mm and 25mm) so you can appreciate this camera.FOCUSINGWith an MSC lens, focus is blazing fast and accurate. DSLRs might still have the advantage in extremely low light but the size tradeoff isn't worth it to me. X100 can not compete here at all. 3D Tracking only works with slow moving object but maybe a future firmware will make it more useful.BUILD QUALITYI wish the EM-5 was made in Japan like the X100 but the build quality is solid. What drove me crazy was dust getting into the viewfinder of the X100, but the EM-5 is dust proof and weather sealed. The paint is not impervious to wear but neither was the X100. They both feel like quality cameras in your hands.HANDLINGThe EM-5 feels more compact to me and has the perception of a more compact camera (unless you stick a giant telephoto lens on it). I like the layout of the X100 better and it feels less cramped. But with the optional hand grip or a half case, the EM-5 would be perfect. Buttons on the X100 feels a bit more responsive and I loved how you can add your own custom shutter button. However, the EM-5 camera setting don't get bumped around in your bag like the X100 since the dials are not notched to specific values. (There were times when I had exp compensation set to +/- 1 without noticing.) You can pretty much customize everything on the EM-5 which was something users complained about on the X100. (Took them a year to update the firmware just so you can set the raw button to something else useful.) Both the EVF and tilting OLED screens display images beautifully, and I'm usually not a fan of EVFs. The touchscreen is great advantage for selective focusing and quickly changing settings. The X100's hybrid viewfinder was extremely cool but the EM-5's EVF and tilting screen combo is much more practical. I do miss the X100's aperture ring on the lens, intuitive controls, and quiet leaf shutter with 1/2000 flash sync,  but overall the speed and customization of EM-5 wins over the X100. Both of them have convoluted menus but with the EM-5, once you've customized everything, there's very little need to go back.LOOKS AND FEATURESX100 is gorgeous and has a classic look but my silver EM-5 is a close second, especially with a silver lens... stunner. EM-5 has features out the wazoo! More than you'll ever need probably. I especially like the diorama art filter and being able to take 3D photos. X100 is simple and their classic film filters will be missed, but the EM-5's 5-axis IBIS and 9fps shooting is killer.QUIRKS ON THE EM5IBIS humming is there and noticeable indoors. The EVF auto switch sensor is very close to the lcd screen so sometimes it switches when you're touching the screen. Left side ports are hard to get to without first tilting the lcd screen out. I don't mind these few quirks since the X100's list of quirks was much longer and annoying.CONCLUSIONI do not regret selling my X100 or my Canon DSLR at all. With the right lenses, the EM-5 does everything I want/need it to. Image quality is superb and almost all the settings can be customized. Everything is packaged in a nice compact and weathersealed body that's reasonably priced for what it delivers. It lets you shoot photos without getting frustrated and gives you more creative freedom than most cameras on the market. I did not care for the m4/3 system before but the lens selection is awesome and is still growing. The EM-5 made me a believer that you can have everything you want in a camera without lugging around a 25lb kit. Unless you want to shell out for a Leica or need the quality of a medium format camera, I see no reason to get anything else until Olympus makes and EM-6.P.S. I don't compare the EM-5 to the original OM series. I think it's irrelevant and snobby. They both great photographic achievements in compact photography during their time. I hate useless reviews like on DigitalRev.com where all they talk about is how it's not like the original OM series... rubbish. The EM-5 is like nothing else in it's market and should be commended for it. Yeah the Nex-7 and X Pro 1 has APS-C  sensors but how many lenses are available for those systems? X Pro1 focusing is still slow and it's a clunky camera that's not really compact anymore. The Nex-7's EVF, although crispy, is quite laggy, not as enjoyable to use overall. The Panasonic GX1 might have a 16mp sensor but it's what you do with the sensor that counts. If you're looking at this camera, it's really a no brainer when you get features here that you only find in top of the line DSLRs.", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible photos, but numerous quality issues too", "Author": "Trev", "ReviewID": "R92B2T13AOVEK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been using the Olympus OM-D E-M5 as my primary camera for about 7 months now, with the exception of the two months it was with Olympus for warranty service. I love the images that this camera produces, the size, the in body image stabilization (IBIS), and the excellent Olympus prime lenses. However, I have also experienced a number of serious quality issues in the short time that I have had this camera, and I am considering other options now.Within two weeks of receiving the camera, the paint below the Olympus logo and around the lens mount on the front of the camera started to flake off. I had not dropped or dinged the camera, so I believe that this was just a bad paint job. The flakes that were coming off looked like tiny black pepper flakes, which is the last thing that I want to see around the lens mount of an interchangeable lens camera. I also noticed that the bottom of the frame that surrounds the rear screen had a hairline crack near the center screw. After a little research, I learned that this defect was common in a certain batch of OM-Ds and mine was one of them. Apparently the cause was an over-tightened screw.I sent the camera to the Olympus America repair facility in Hauppage, NY as directed by the Olympus America website where I filed an online repair ticket. What I did not know is that Olympus was in the process of moving their repair facility to Texas. It took Olympus almost two full months to repair the camera and return it to me, and for the first month and a half I could not even confirm that they had received my camera despite numerous emails and calls to customer service. I finally learned that my camera had been forwarded to the Texas facility where it was assigned a new repair ticket number, and I was finally able to track the repair online. However, I signed up for email notifications and never received a single one.Since receiving the camera back from the repair center, I have had no further issues with the paint flaking off. However, one of the plastic textured grips popped off the front of the camera, and I discovered that it was only held on with double sided tape. The person who installed the tape had put a large crease in it, which meant there was less surface area to hold the piece in place. The repair center also lost the accessory port cover that prevents water intrusion when the accessory port is not in use. Finally, less than a week after I got the camera back, the hairline crack was clearly visible again near the center screw on the bottom the rear screen frame. After learning that the crack does not affect the integrity of the weather sealing, I opted to not send the camera back again after my first negative repair experience.Yesterday, I was shooting some photos before work and noticed that each time I engaged the IBIS, I would see either green or magenta horizontal lines within the EVF. I have the IBIS set to engage with a half press of the shutter button so that I can stabilize longer lenses in the EVF for more accurate framing. I was also disappointed to see that the same green and magenta lines appeared in several of the photos that I took, completely ruining the photos. At this point, it looks like I have no choice but to send the camera back in for another repair.When this camera is working, it is one of the best cameras that I have ever used and the image quality is exceptional. I love the small size, light weight, and tilting screen too. However, I have completely lost confidence in this camera, and have returned to shooting with my DSLR for the time being.I cannot recommend this camera based on my experience with it, and with the Olympus America repair center.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "Kon Peki", "ReviewID": "R2QSD6PEXE6W1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fifth Micro 4/3 camera, having previously bought the G1, GH1, GH2, and E-P3.

It just feels so right on my hands.  It feels solid.  Not too light.  Definitely not too heavy.  I'm sure the extension of HLD-6 would make it even comfortable to hold... but I don't think it's worth $300 given my satisfaction over its ergonomics.Buttons - Still getting used to the orientation.  I've owned previous PEN series so the menu is not that hard to absorb.EVF - Nothing great to write home about.  It's OK... but not as great as the NEX-7's (drop by at your local camera store & compare).  I'm not very picky regarding the feature since I don't use it as much as the 3-inch screen.New IBIS - Just awesome.  I actually have better pictures coming out of my Panny 100-300mm lens, on the long end of the zoom - handheld! (not 100% of the time though, but that's user-error due to handheld test).Flippity screen - Very very useful.  I prefer to take pictures of children at their eye level so this helps A LOT without having to kneel or bend down as much.  Also very useful on over-the-head shots.  I just wish it was the same articulating screen as Panny's G-series.  Oh, well.Touch screen - Another COOL feature.  Great for stolen shots.  Not fast enough for active children at play.14-42mm Lens - Nothing special.  But I prefer this over the 12-50mm lens since I don't care for videos & weather seal stuff.  Not to mention $200 cheaper at half the size!  I'm sure others would disagree.Humming sound - Yeah, it's there.  Only noticeable in a quiet room.  I had some friends around our house to drool over the camera & none of them commented on the humming sound.  I guess it only matters if someone is looking for it.  Not about to consider this an issue.Lugs - It has grown to be a pain.  At such a small footprint for a camera, right hand tends to hit that annoying triangle coil (for the neckstrap).  I read some suggestions regarding the matter, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to alter it...

This is my first m4/3 camera and I am very very happy with it.Coming from a much larger DSLR, it was a bit of an adjustment in terms of ergonomics. I had to learn to be comfortable holding it, but that took a day or two at most. I am happy with the image quality and high ISO images are better than any digital Olympus camera I have seen. Now that Lightroom 4 supports the E-M5 and I can process the RAW files, I think the image quality is excellent. It's not perfect, but then what camera is?The famous \"hum\" actually sound more like air from a tiny fan in the camera, or like when you hold a seashell to your ear. Most of the time I don't notice it- in fact I have accidentally left the camera on several times and forgotten about it. I don't hear anything. It might be audible in a completely silent room, but barely.I am normally a bargain hunter- I rarely pay full price for anything. When the first PEN came out I thought it too expensive and passed on it. I was very nervous about paying over $1000 for a camera combo- I'd didn't even pay that for any of my DSLRs! That said, I have no regrets about paying full price for this camera.My only complaint is that I really wanted the silver body but they seem to be quite rare right now. Seriously, after handling this camera I forgot all about color preferences.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gets most everything right...", "Author": "Ken Walsh", "ReviewID": "R2ZRE5700RFU18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well as of the time of writing this review it is rather hard to get one of these cameras, and as a highly anticipated camera I'm sure there will be many reviews better than mine soon.  Here though is the quick early adopters guide:- As an Olympus camera this thing is ridiculously configurable.  You can swap dial functions, directions, many programmable buttons and so forth.  This means from an ergonomic perspective you can get it to do nearly anything you want.- It is most definitely a small camera.  Some early adopters are finding that troublesome and prefer to add the optional grip.  Personally I don't mind small cameras and so far have been very happy using it.- The IBIS system does make a whispering noise.  It is audible to the photographer in a quiet room.  Still audible held at arms length in a very quiet room.- The shutter is very quiet for a focal plane shutter.  Certainly the quietest micro-four-thirds shutter so far.- The IBIS system is very good, at least at the moderate focal lengths I've tested it at (45mm) it performs exceptionally with an easy 3 stop advantage.  A quick test at around 150mm was less satisfactory, maybe two stops at best though is seems to be what the Panasonic OIS systems are doing at such focal lengths as well.  More testing needed.- Image quality is excellent.  I'm still waiting for RAW support from Adobe, but interim tests by myself and others show it at least on par with the GH2 and G3 - perhaps a bit better in both high ISO noise and low ISO dynamic range.- AF is very fast.  Early adopters have discovered a rather interesting \"feature\" - you can make many AF functions perform even better by selecting higher contrast and saturation settings in the camera.  It appears the CDAF system uses the JPEG engine output.  Counter intuitive to be sure, but users are posting clear improvements in continuous AF mode especially if using high contrast vivid settings.- One apparent gotcha so far - IBIS does not function in video mode with adapted MF lenses.  They work just fine in stills mode, and IBIS works in video mode with native micro-four-thirds lenses just fine, but no luck with adapted lenses in video mode for IBIS.  Multiple users confirm and I've tested this as well.  So if you've got a bunch of adapted cine lenses you were hoping to use hold off until it is determined that this is a correctable firmware bug or a true limitation of the IBIS system.- The OLED display on the back (LCD I suppose you could call it) has a fairly pronounced color shift when viewed even slightly off angle.  This appears to be a limitation of this type of OLED display.  Things go a bit green when viewed even 10 or 15 degrees off axis.  A slightly annoying aesthetic issue.Overall a wonderful camera.  Excellent sensor plus great IBIS opens up lots of possibilities for low light shooting with primes that hasn't existed in this system so far.  Either you got IBIS and a so-so sensor from Olympus or a good sensor and no IBIS from Panasonic.  Best of both worlds with this camera.Warnings would be that some folks find it \"too small\" to be comfortable and that it is not an inexpensive camera so consider the value proposition.  For instance, the Panasonic G3 is significantly less expensive and has comparable image quality and many comparable features.That's it for now, but definitely a five star product in my book.-----------------Some further thoughts, some comparing to the GH2.- There isn't a particularly quick way to change between bracketing and standard shooting on the OM-D (the GH2 has a nice dedicated switch).  In theory you could use a \"Myset\" on the OM-D (the Olympus implementation of custom modes) but I really find the \"Myset\" implementation to be difficult to use and suspect I'll never use it.  The OM-D does support a vast array of bracketing options.- The GH2 has a \"record\" button right on the top of the camera that switches you to video mode and is easy to bump, a definite annoyance.  On the OM-D you can program its similar button to do something actually useful which is much better.- There is an excellent live view mode called \"highlights and shadows\" which displays highlight and shadow clipping areas in real time on the live view (highlights turn orange, shadows blue).  You can even set the thresholds for the clipping indicators.  This is an excellent feature, and more useful than a live histogram if you are attempting \"expose to the right\" kinds of techniques.  Many cameras (GH2 included) can display clipping in playback, but of course it is most useful in live view.  Of course the clipping indicators are based on the JPEG engine so if you would need to tweak the JPEG settings to better match RAW levels if you are a RAW shooter.One more thought on the camera being small and the grip a bit \"crimpy\".  It seems like from reading user reviews those that typically shoot with two hands (left cradling the body and lens, right controlling the camera) are likely to be happy.  Those that often shoot with one hand are probably going to notice the tight grip and controls placement more.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Yep, OMD makes micro Four Thirds a legit replacement for DSLR", "Author": "Robbster", "ReviewID": "R3MCFXHAV8E0ZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**************Update 2014-05-02  OMD EM5 with the Oly 12-40 f2.8 zoom************The Olympus 12-40mm f2.8 zoom is a fabulous complement to the OMD EM5!  Outstanding build quality, sharp as a tack across the zoom range, elegant to operate, extends the UI of your camera with another Fn button. Olympus M Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm f/2.8 Pro Interchangeable LensAdding 1-2 stops of speed across this zoom range vs. options like the 12-50 kit lens makes a night and day difference for my everyday shooting, while the convenience to frame via zoom vs. primes has always been a strong preference of mine going back to film days, and now I can do so without compromise as function of focal length. Cool! Indoors, I get way more flexibility in shutter speed (isolate action, avoid blur) and/or ISO (reduce noise). Outdoors, I can play with DOF more without resorting to primes, and can shoot at really low ISO for lowest possible noise. While I knew intellectually that this would be the case, the *degree* to which this lens opens the operating window of my OMD under a wide range of shooting conditions is just remarkable. It's like I was sitting on the head of a pin with some of the other lenses I own, without much room to move before making a big compromise in image quality (e.g., too slow shutter, too high ISO). I'm using my OMD more a result, and having more fun to boot!Regarding lenses I'll now sell as a result of this purchase, here is the low down: Selling my Sigma 19mm f2.8, Sigma 30mm f2.8 (both very nice primes), the Oly 12-50 kit lens, and my Oly 9-18mm wide angle zoom. Will keep my long zooms, the Oly 14-150 and 75-300 for those occasions when long zoom is needed, and my Pany 14mm f2.5 as my most compact option for those times when total size of camera+lens matters. The one other purchase I am still considering is Oly's new compact zoom, for street shooting and vacation photos in bright light.But if I could only have one lens to use with the OMD, this would be it for me!*********************** Original Review ******************************First, I'm old enough to remember the original film OMD's and I truly love the retro styling and look of the Silver OMD EM5.  A huge bonus for me in the coolness department was that all my son's 16 year old friends raved about how it looked as well.  As I say, bonus points!So, what makes this a legit replacement for a (much larger) DSLR?The biggest one is this: for a similar learning investment in the OMD, you can get image quality quite comparable to a DSLR in many circumstances, with a much easier to carry and use kit that also wins you style points.Specifically:*Image Quality - incredibly close to APS-C sensors in DSLRs in resolution and low light performance.  The bigger difference now is what lenses you use, and how well do you know how to shoot photos vs. sensor size for IQ.*AF Speed - equal in good light, and once you learn the tricks to a contrast detection AF system, you can make it work well just about anywhere.*Size - a big win!  The best camera is the one you have with you, as the saying goes, and for most folks, the OMD is going to go more places, and be more socially acceptable to use, than a DSLR.*Lens Selection - Fast primes, fast zooms, super zooms, wide zooms, just about every niche is now filled, AND the rapid growth of micro four thirds camera sales is attracting even more lens development, meaning selection will grow even more rapidly.Additional OMD delighters*Best Micro Four Thirds camera for stills*Build quality and feel*Great manual controls combined with touch screen*Battery life*Micro Four Thirds ecosystem of lenses, backup bodies and accessoriesLimitations*Learning to shoot really fast moving subjects with CD AF.  Can be done, but you have to learn a few tricks.*Menu complexity - you have to master the menus a bit to get the most out of the OMD, as it is not really a P&S; replacement unless you are really ready to step up and learn the basics of photography including aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and Depth of Field relationships plus some translations of these into the digital world and the Olympus menus.  Worth the effort, but there is a learning curve.*Very good video, but NOT the top m43 choice if video is your TOP priority, that would go to Panasonic GH2/GX1 and their lens ecosystem.Recommended lenses*The kit lens is only so so. OK for the price difference in kit vs. body only, but in general if you want this camera, you'll also want one or more additional lenses to get the most out of it depending on what kinds of shooting you do:Some lens perspective from another post of mine, below, so you can see what I've chosen and why...I'd like to present an alternative trinity of prime lenses below, with costs new on Amazon US as point of reference and a bit about why I chose them. I own two of these three.Pany 14mm f2.5 ($280 vs. $799 for 12mm f2) - own it - my fast wide prime for indoor groupsPanasonic Lumix 14mm f/2.5 G Aspherical Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens CamerasSigma 19mm f2.8 ($199 vs. $799 for 25mm f1.4) - own it - my street/night/candid prime and most used lens overallSigma 19mm  F2.8 EX DN -Micro 4/3 400963Sigma 30 mm f2.8 ($199 vs. $399 for 45mm f1.8) - my choice for a candid portrait/more tightly framed street shotsSigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN- Micro 4/3 330963Total cost $678 vs. $1997.I especially like the Sigma's, they are sharp, very fast to AF on the OMD, high quality and generally underrated, at least by some folks.Not to say that Jim's original trinity might not be better for your needs, rather, just sharing another option for your consideration, one with high IQ, bit different focal lengths, perhaps less panache' but much lower costs.Zooms:My keepers:Oly 9-18mm - wide landscape/day/crowded street shootingOlympus M ED 9-18mm f/4.0-5.6 micro Four Thirds Lens for Olympus and Panasonic Micro Four Third Interchangeable Lens Digital CameraOly 14-150mm - my casual/travel/daylight walk around zoom, my copy just a bit soft wide open, good from about 20mm on, mounted on my OMD most often other than the Sigma 19mm. Got this as part of an EPL1 kit for less than the cost of the lens alone, which provided me with both the lens I wanted, and a \"free\" backup camera emoticon - grin.Olympus ED 14-150mm f/4.0-5.6 micro Four Thirds Lens for Olympus and Panasonic Micro Four Third Interchangeable Lens Digital CameraOly 75-300mm - long/super zoom. What a great FUN lens to have in my kit. 600mm equivalent in good light rocks!Olympus 75-300mm f/4.8 Lens for Olympus Pen Cameras, Micro Four-Thirds Mount CamerasKit Zooms:Oly 12-50mm - first shots with this were unimpressive, but plan to use it more now that I'm more fluent with the OMD and see what the actual quality is. Potential replacement: Pany X 12-35mm f2.8Oly 14-42mm compact zoom - everyday lens for the EPL1. Potential replacement (to create an even more compact backup kit): Pany X 14-42 pancake zoom, but ONLY when blurriness issues are fully resolved!Bought and SoldPany 20mm f1.7 - great on my original m4/3 kit (Pany GF1 and GH1), but AF speed and reliability in low light were too frustrating on the OMD. Like the Sigma 19mm MUCH better.Oly 40-150mm - very nice IQ, excellent value for the price, but not flexible enough for me compared to the 14-150.Oly 14-54 FT + Adapter - great, fairly fast short zoom lens, again, just too slow to AF, and too big and heavy on m4/3 body.If you get an OMD, have fun selecting your glass, you can create a very high quality, flexible, and portable digital camera kit that is customized to your needs and shooting style.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "My thoughts after a year of ownership.....", "Author": "LWM", "ReviewID": "RT7Q5TCZ5FD5H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My background....  I am a part time professional photographer and I own a range of canon cameras and lenses.  I still use the canon for my work photography most of the time, but I am starting to use this olympus more and more.Let me start by saying that I absolutely love this little camera.  I clicked the \"buy it now\" button the moment it first appeared on amazon.  I waited several months for the backorders to clear and I've now owned it close to a year.  I have absolutely no regrets.  As odd as this may sound, this camera makes me happy.  Whenever I use it I imagine I have a dopey grin on my face.Initially I fought with this olympus to get sharp shots.  If, like me,  you are coming from a DSLR camera, you might have some difficulty adjusting to the balance of the camera.  It is very light (which is one of the great things about it) but that means that it is a bit more prone to camera shake if you don't have it on a tripod and if, like me,  you don't have rock steady hands.  I stuck with the camera through my initial frustration and I'm so glad I did.  I learned my own best way of holding it in order to keep it steady.If you are thinking of buying this camera I think its important to hear some thoughts on what it can and cannot do.  There are already so many good solid reviews here on amazon that I am only going to hit the high and low points as I see them.  These might not be the same highs and lows that everyone else has so just keep in mind that these points are my OPINIONS.THE GOOD....- WEIGHT/SIZE Light as a feather and beautifully constructed.  I can carry this camera in a small bag with 2 or 3 or 4 lenses all day and not feel any strain.  I used to carry a camera with one lens with me EVERYWHERE, but after several years the dslr around my neck or on my shoulder started to take a heavy physical toll.  Now I can go back to having a camera with me at all times.- IMAGE QUALITY can be outstanding.  I have taken some stunning photos with this thing.  Punchy colors, Creamy bokehs.  Good photos taken with this thing rival good photos taken with any DSLR. The olympus 45mm f1.8 lens is a relatively inexpensive thing of beauty.- MENU SYSTEM.  The super control panel is, hands down, one of the best and most intuitive menu systems I've ever used on a camera.  Changing settings is effortless and takes only seconds to accomplish.  You might not think this is all that important, but when you need to get your shot, you will be endlessly grateful for this brilliant super control panel.  I've gotten shots with this camera that I wouldn't have gotten with my higher end DSLRs because I would have been fidgiting with the settings and the moment would have passed.- FOCUSING Super quick focusing and enough focus points to keep anyone happy.  With the grid system they use in this camera it is absolutely effortless to switch focus points.  The touch screen is amazing.  Touch any place on the LCD and the camera can instantly focus on that spot and take the shot before you can blink.  I know the iphone can do this but it is my first experience with that touch focus.  Focusing is accurate.  Gone are the days of shutter lag.  Reviewers more scientific than I am can tell you relative to other cameras whether the focusing is faster or slower, but for my purposes it is fast enough and tremendously accurate.- UNOBTRUSIVE  This might not be an issue for some people but for me it is.  When I pull out a DSLR to take a shot it can draw a lot of unwanted attention particularly if I have a large lens attached. If I am photographing an outdoor event with a long white canon L lens, inevitably several people will come up to me to discuss just how big my lens is. So, this camera really doesn't attract attention to itself.  I can get the photos I need to get without making folks self conscious and without ending up in long discussions about the length of my equipment.  Seriously, unobtrusive is a good thing.BUILD QUALITY- this is a matter of personal taste, but I find this camera to be a thing of beautyFUN FACTOR- this little camera just puts the fun back into photography.  I can't say that enough.  Fun Fun Fun.  I love taking pictures.THE NOT SO GOOD- HIGHER ISOs - I have several friends who are very good or excellent photographers who also own this camera and we debate this point heavily.  I have not found this camera to be reliably noise free at ISO 800 or higher.  My feeling is that you need to shoot wide open in darker settings and if your lens doesn't open up wider than f4, I think you will struggle with noisy shadow detail.  That said, I have gotten some beautifully low noise images at ISO 800 or even 1600 when I use f2 and even with f8.  I should say for the record that I do like some noise in my images at times particularly if I am going to convert them to black and white.  But not all noise is created equal and I just don't like some of the noise visible in the backgrounds or shadow detail with this camera at higher ISO.  Many of my friends disagree with me completely so this is up for grabsTRACKING OF MOVING OBJECTS -  I photograph active dogs a great deal and so far I have not been successful in using the focus tracking of this camera to get good shots.  In fact, I am terrible with it.  But I have seen shots from other photographers which are very good at this.  I don't know what their secret is.  I am guessing the majority of people will have problems with this the way I do and there are probably a handful of folks who can nail the focus tracking.  So many reviews site it as a weak point of the camera so if sports is your thing and tracking moving subjects is your thing, this is not the camera for you.  But lets put it in perspective...  if you want to capture your baby's first steps or your childrens' antics, this camera would be quite capable.CONCLUSION:Did I mention this camera put the fun back in photography for me?  I can't stress that enough.  If you are an experienced photographer coming from a dslr you may be frustrated at first and you may not relinquish all of your photo chores to this puppy. I still do not trust it quite enough to bring it as my only camera for very important photo shoots.  Or maybe the camera is trustworthy but I don't trust myself quite enough to coax the best out of it every time.  If you are coming from a point and shoot you will be in camera heaven. Make sure you get yourself a couple of really good lenses to cover a range of situations.  I can't stress enough how gorgeous that 45 mm f1.8 is.  The 12-50 kit lens isn't half bad either.  I also own the panasonic 45-200 lens.  For the money, you can't beat it and I use it often, but there are better longer range lenses out there.So why not 5 stars?  I was tempted to give it 5 stars but I try to save those 5 star reviews for near perfect items.  The grainier high ISO shots and the so so focus tracking keep me from pushing in that fifth star.I get asked about this camera all the time and I lend it out often to prospective buyers.  I am thinking of putting up an OMD-EM5 gallery on my website so people can see shots at different ISOs taken with different lenses.  If it turns out that there is enough interest, I'll probably put the gallery up and I will edit this review if I do.If you do get this camera, ENJOY and HAVE FUN!", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Autofocus Issue", "Author": "Gadget Man \"Gadget Man\"", "ReviewID": "R1P2LGY1F0HX8K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There is a lot to like about this camera; small size, enormous amount of settings to adjust the camera to your photo shooting preference; water and dust resistant design, etc.  At first I really liked the camera and was impressed with the blazingly fast auto-focus.  But then I started to notice that pictures of objects that were 15-20 feet away were not really sharp.  I took dozens pictures handheld to see if this was just a camera shake issue (my fault) or inaccurate auto-focus issue(camera's fault).  The problem persisted.I then took pictures with my Canon G1X and this OM-d of flowers that were about 20 feet away.  Both cameras were set on auto ISO, and Aperture Priority using F/6 and F/6.3, and both handheld.  (I had the 12-50mm kit lens on the OM-d).  Shot after shot, the Canon G1X nailed the focus, with very sharp pictures.  Shot after shot, the OM-d had inaccurate focus.  Now this may have simply been a problem with my sample camera.  So it may not be a problem in other OM-d cameras.  But I ended up returning the camera.  I will add that when I took pictures of flowers and other objects from 2 to 10 feet away, the autofocus was very accurate and the pictures were crisp.  But the Canon G1X exhibits less noise at high ISO.If I didn't have the autofocus problem I would give this camera 4.5 stars.  So if the problem was just with my sample, then I would highly recommend the camera.  But I can only rate it based on the sample I bought...and for that it gets a 3 (demoted to a 2, after the second OM-d body I bought exhibited the same problems -- see updated below).Update - August 2012: I got a second OM-d...this time with the 14-42mm lens. I wanted to see if the problem was just a quality issue applicable to my first OM-d.  Unfortunately, the second OM-d had the same autofocus issues as the first.  I call it autofocus issues, but frankly it could be the Image Stabilization (IBIS), the shutter, or some other problem that causes not to be as sharp as they should be.  But the bottom line is that the camera, in certain situations (not all) will not take pictures as sharp as they should be.I tried dozens of pictures using Shutter Priority at 1/100th of a second and 1/400th of a second; Aperture Priority; Program Mode...the problem persisted in all modes.  Using the anti-shock setting seemed to help somewhat, but not totally.  This setting delays the firing of the shutter after the shutter button is pressed.  I compared it to shots taken with a Canon G1X and T2i.  The problem was isolated to the OM-d.  The other cameras did not exhibit this sharpness/autofocus issue.Some people reading my original review apparently did not find my review helpful...likely because most people don't like any criticism of a camera they own or love.  But the issue I have described has been mentioned in some of the posts on Dpreview.  It appears I am not the only person that has noticed this autofocus/sharpness issue with the OM-d.  One of the people who posted a thread on Dpreview did very extensive and fairly sophisticated testing.  He concluded the problem was present with or without IBIS.  He thought it could be a shutter issue.  I am not knowledgeable enough to know the cause.  But I have observed the problem (which I call an autofocus issue) in two OM-d cameras...and I eliminated all the issues that might implicate user error, or settings in the camera.  The problem is real, and I'm not sure why the review sites have not observed it.  It is unfortunate, because there is so much about this camera to love...", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "The hype, the wait, the joy", "Author": "nathan", "ReviewID": "R3TNP3ROAKFTCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first heard of the Olympus E-M5 through 43rumors.com back in early December of 2011. I was checking the site nearly every day for bits and pieces of new info and rode the rumors/hype/craziness wave. I placed my order for the silver body only as soon as it came up on Amazon and they still haven't delivered. Ended up getting this 14-42mm in black kit instead. All I can say is that after all the hype and the 6 month wait, the camera delivers with performance, quality, style and joy.There are plenty of reviews out there that covers the camera in detail. Let me tell you why I like it.1. Makes me want to go out and shoot. Not just because it's a new toy, but because it performs so well. I carry this camera everywhere and take shots of everything.2. Bells and whistles. I'm all about that. The EVF, touch screen, fast AF, 5-axis IBIS, multiple dials, fun filters, and on and on. All the features make the camera that much more enjoyable.3. Lots of options. There are so many options this camera can really be customized to fit your own style. For example, when I hit delete to erase a picture, it used to default to NO and then I would hit the up arrow and press ok. I really wished I could simply hit delete and automatically choose YES or simply delete entirely. There's an option for that.4. It's compact yet heavy duty. I can take this camera anywhere without breaking my shoulder or having my arm wear out. I can carry a small bag (Billingham Hadley Small) with all the gear that I need and it's lighter than my DSLR lens.5. Less intimidating, better for social life. When I took portraits with my DSLR, people would feel intimidated by its size. In a social setting, friends would hesitate to take the camera to snap a few pics themselves. But the E-M5 makes people more relaxed when I'm taking their picture and gets in the hands of more of my friends (with my permission) so they can take some shots of me as well.I use this with a Pany 20mm f/1.7 pancake style which is very travel friendly without compromising picture quality. The kit lens hasn't left the box since the day I received the camera but I hear it's a great lens as well.Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anybody that wants great, quality shots taken from a day out in the sun to a dim lit restaurant; all in a pocketable(ish) size camera.

I've been running through a few non-scientific but real world tests (for my kind of shooting) to compare against my two PEN Olympus cameras (E-P1 and E-PM1) and the Nikon D7000:- Image Quality: I can't really see a discernible difference between the E-M5 and the D7000, which is to say excellent IQ on both cameras...at most I can see a difference in white balance, but as that's easily managed in Lightroom for me, it's not an issue either way. - High ISO/Low Noise: The high ISO noise between the E-M5 and the D7000 is very comparable...more of a slight difference in grain pattern/illumination of noise which again is manageable through Lightroom (huge improvement over the PEN cameras).  I tend to shoot in ISO1600 with the E-M5 for most indoors/low-light situations, which is something I would never do with the PENs due to the amount of noise they would produce at that setting, and I still get very clean sharp images (again, very comparable to my D7000 to my eyes). - Dynamic Range: There's a lot of information stored in the RAW files of the E-M5, and using Lightroom 4.1 I'm able to pull out all kinds of detail in shadows and highlights (plus the E-M5 has a built in shadow/highlight manual adjustment that displays on the screen if you want to tweak it in camera in real time) - Image Stabilization: This is kicker right here; I'm able to take very clear and sharp images handheld at down to 2/10ths of a second (virtually impossible on the D7000 even with image stabilized lenses like my Tamron 70-300mm). The 5-axis IBIS system allows sharp shooting in lower light/lower ISO than would normally be feasible with my PEN or Nikon cameras (the camera has definitely lived up to the \"hype\" of the new IBIS in my opinion). - Low Light: Again, this is a huge improvement over the PEN cameras. I've tested very low light shots comparably between both the D7000 (with 35 f1.8 lens) and E-M5 (with 20 f1.7 lens) and I haven't found any situation yet where the E-M5 does not function at least as well of the D7000 in terms of noise produced when bumping up the ISO (both tested using ISO1600) and detail retention in the shadowed areas (the E-M5 was actually sharper due to the 5-Axis IBIS keeping the camera steadier than the D7000 as I conducted the tests hand-held).  The PEN cameras at ISO1600, while not terrible per se, produce more noise than I like which is why I would always use the D7000 in low-light situations previously. - Weather Sealed: Something that the D7000 or PENs do not have the capability of doing is shooting in a full rain storm without worrying about damage to the camera.  I took the E-M5 out in a rain storm as a test, and using the 12-50mm kit lens (which is also weather sealed), I was able to take very nice shots (again, pretty much a typical kit f/3.5 lens) with the camera completely soaked and had no worries or issues. - Touch Screen focus/shooting: The tiltable touch-screen will focus (virtually instantly almost every time) and take a shot using the focus point of where you've touched (this can be turned off right from the screen as well if you don't want or need the function). The tiltable screen works great for taking waist-level shots to get awesome candids (I took several of my niece the other day this way since she usually goes all shy if she discerns you're taking a picture of her).I haven't found anything I dislike about the camera at this point, and as far as I can tell, the E-M5 is just as functional as the D7000 but much smaller and lighter. Manually focusing with my adapted Nikon lenses (this was how I performed several tests between the PEN, the E-M5, and the D7000) works very nicely due to the built-in EVF and selectable magnification to get precise focus. The 9-frames per second burst rate is damn impressive (would work very well for creating animated GIFs with all the frames). The \"Live Bulb\" is pretty amazing where you can take a long exposure shot and view it \"developing\" in real time so you can stop the exposure when you see it reach the point you want.I've yet to test the AF-C mode, and from what I've read it's still not quite as good as a DSLR can produce, but it's still supposed to be the best M43 camera (and one of the best mirror-less cameras) for this functionality...but I rarely, if ever, use this functionality on my Nikon (always use AF-S mode/center focus point), so personally this isn't an issue.I've only minimally tested the 1080p/30 video capabilities of the E-M5 as video is something I don't use very often, but comparing video I have shot with the E-M5 and my Nikon D7000, they both appear to be very comparable.  The IBIS of the E-M5 seems to do a very nice job of stabilizing the video, and there is a considerable improvement over the PENs on the \"jell-o\" effect of video when moving the camera rapidly side-to-side.Bottom line: camera rocks, works as advertised, and definitely vies to be my all-time/always with/all situations camera (my Nikon D7000/Tamron 70-30mm still currently edges out the E-M5 for auto-focused long range telephoto since I only have the 14-42mm and 12-50mm lenses as native M43 telephoto options).", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "First impressions", "Author": "Jim Hart", "ReviewID": "R15B5J359C9IUI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First impressions:(This is not intended as a comprehensive review of the O-MD.  It is, rather, a compilation of random thoughts and impressions gathered during my first 24 hours with the O-MD.  Full reviews are, of course, available elsewhere along with sample photographs and reviews of the \"kit\" lens.  The intention of this review is to perhaps answer a question or two that a perspective buyer might have.)The camera is heavier than one might think, especially with the 12-50mm weather sealed lens attached.As noted in other reviews the camera is smaller than it appears in many photographs. If one has large hands one might consider finding a brick and mortar store in order to test the ergonomics of the O-MD.  I have medium sized hands; my DSLR is a Nikon D300 with battery grip attached.  That is a fairly large (and heavy) system, but I have found no problem in adjusting to the much smaller O-MD body.  I am, however, considering the purchase of the optional grip for the O-MD to counterbalance the weight of some lenses.***EDIT: I ordered the HLD-6; Amazon has them discounted to $325 as of this writing, some $70 under suggested retail  6/23/12.  I would recommend that anyone considering the OM-D E5 camera also consider the battery grip (available on Amazon, there are reviews of the grip available).  I now consider it a \"must have\" if one does considerable portrait style framing or if one wants the security of having two batteries available.  Note that the spare battery does not come with the grip!  The grip does add some bulk and weight to the system, but not as much as I had feared.  The battery in the grip may be accessed if the camera is mounted on a tripod or monopod.***I do not consider the camera to be \"pocketable\"; even with the Panasonic 20mm \"pancake\" lens attached it would require a rather large pocket to hold the camera.The rubber thumb grip on the right/rear of the body feels very secure and offers a good grip for my hands.  Those with larger hands may not find this to be the case.The 12-50mm weather sealed lens (heaviest of the \"kit\" lenses) begs for support from the left hand when shooting.  The length and weight of the lens overbalances the camera body, causing the camera to want to tilt downwards.  (This, of course, would be the case on any interchangeable lens camera body to which a long, heavy lens was attached).The two control dials fall \"readily too hand\"; the rear dial is within easy reach of my forefinger, thus negating the need to move my right thumb from the rear grip.The \"on/off\" switch is in, possibly, not the best location.  It is the lower right corner of the camera body.  I prefer a switch over the \"on/off\" button on the Olympus E-PL1, but having it mounted on the top of the camera, like the Nikon D300, would be ideal.  However there is not much real estate available on a camera as small as this, so one has to make some concessions as to control placement.  The reason the current location is poor is not because it may be accidentally powered off or on, it's poor because having it on the top of the camera makes it more ergonomic.  Your index finger or thumb are already in place when picking up the camera to reach a top mounted switch, whereas the current location of the switch requires that the camera be supported by the left hand while the right hand powers the body up.The shutter button is smooth to operate.The control buttons on the back, being weather sealed, are not as \"crisp\" in movement as one might be accustomed to in other camera bodies.  I do not find that an issue, but I am used to working with weather sealed cameras; others may have a small period of acclimation before the buttons feel \"right\".The tilting screen can be completely turned off while shooting through the electronic viewfinder (EVF), or can be programmed to turn off automatically when the EVF is used.  I prefer the EVF full time, and so have powered down the screen except for reviewing photographs or changing menus.  The tilt screen is functional, but I cannot give more information on that feature because it is simply one I will not use.  Other reviewers have posted comments on the usability of the tilt screen, and I would recommend that those who are interested in the feature read those reviews.There is a slight delay in powering up the EVF when brought to one's eye, even when the tilting screen is powered down.  This is different from the Olympus VF2 EVF (which may be used on several of the Olympus Pen camera bodies).  The VF2 can be set to being continuously on, while the O-MD EVF goes dark when removed from the eye.  The delay is not long enough to cause the missing of a shot, but is at first disconcerting for those (like me) who are not expecting it.The \"instant review\" of photographs can be turned off, which is my preferred method of shooting.  Even having the just-taken shot come up automatically for .3 seconds can be distracting.  However if one does want to review the just-taken shot the time the review is visible is adjustable in the menu.The EVF itself is very good (caveat being that I have limited experience with this camera at this point and have not attempted to photograph sports or other rapidly moving subjects).  When rapidly panning the camera there is just a touch of blur in the EVF image.  The EVF is bright and the exposure information seen on the EVF can be modified, and there are several choices of \"grid\" pattern should one choose to see a grid when composing a photograph.There is a sound coming from the in body stabilization mechanism, but it is discernible (to me) only in a nearly silent room.The factory neck strap is lamentable (as are most factory straps); one might budget for a more comfortable strap, such as the OpTech strap.  Of course with a camera this small a wrist strap is also an option.I would recommend the fastest (not the largest) memory card one can afford.  This camera body, while not necessarily in the same class of performance as some of the full framed offerings from Nikon and Canon, still requires a fast card to obtain the maximum satisfaction out of the camera.The fit and finish on the camera that I received is excellent.  The camera, according to a small plate on the bottom, was \"designed in Tokyo and made in China\".I cannot address the video capabilities of the O-MD; I am a photographer, not a cinematographer, and the skills required to create videos will forever elude me.Given that I've had the camera for less than 24 hours and have made only a few test shots with it I cannot make final comment on the quality of the images that the camera can produce.  There are many other reviews available on the Internet written by more experienced (and more skilled) O-MD photographers that include sample images if one cares to do more research. However I do have more than 40 years experience with the 35mm format (on a hobbyist level) and can say that so far I have been favorably impressed by the few photos I've made.  The stabilization technology is first rate and the sensor is, for it's size, excellent.EDIT 6/29/12: The stabilization results from this camera are very, very good.  The In Body Image Stabilization (IBIS) works as advertised and the view through the viewfinder can be set to show the action of the IBIS.  One can actually see the camera shake dwindle and stop as the shutter button is pressed halfway to lock focusing.This camera is not inexpensive and one cannot anticipate that, long term, the camera will retain it's monetary value.  Digital camera bodies tend to depreciate rather quickly compared to, for instance, the Nikon F series of 35mm camera bodies from years past.  Of course one generally buys into a \"system\" rather than a camera body; one purchases external flash units or lenses or grips or other accessories that run the cost of the original purchase up.  Those who are considering purchasing an O-MD as their first \"real\" camera might want to keep such considerations in mind.Cameras must be, as all things are, judged within the framework of their competition. For those considering the O-MD I would recommend considering the Panasonic GH2, the FujiFilm X Pro 1, the FujiFilm X100, the Olympus E-P3, the Sony NEX 5, or the Sony NEX 7.  Those models are, of course, subject to change even as the next round from Olympus will certainly see new technology in the O-MD line.I did a fair amount of research before buying into the O-MD system (to the point of purchasing an Olympus E-PL1 and three lenses in order to see if the Micro Four Third system would be a good fit for my style of photography).  The E-PL1 is a capable camera and is, since it is no longer in production, available new at very reasonable prices. Any lens purchased for the E-PL1 will, of course, work on the O-MD as well.  (Currently the E-PL1 is under three hundred dollars, including the kit lens: http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-E-PL1-Interchangeable-Digital-Black/dp/B0035LBRJO/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1340468881&sr;=1-1&keywords;=olympus+e-pl1 ).Having tested the water with the E-PL1 I've decided to work with the O-MD system.  I think that the O-MD is worth learning (one learns a camera as one does a musical instrument, until finding the correct \"keys\" is second nature, requiring no conscious thought).I would not advise potential O-MD buyers to purchase without checking out the other cameras in the genre.  Patience and research may save one from becoming involved in a system that does not ultimately meet ones needs.I have given the Olympus O-MD five stars, even with my short period of familiarization with the camera, as I consider it to be the current class leader in the Micro Four Thirds realm.  It isn't perfect, but it is very, very good.  Of course Panasonic et.al. will certainly respond with their updated flagship offerings; it is a never ending cycle.Recommended.Regards,Jim", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally", "Author": "Elke", "ReviewID": "R4XSYR9P8X53Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally I have the camera for me! After a long road winding through point and shoots big and small, and even a trip through DSLR's, I am finally home. I see this camera as a beginning, and at some point I might upgrade to another in this line if improvements merit, but this is really what I've wanted all along. Its size means I can bring it along in my (large) handbag for a family trip or get together, and its technology means I can actually have a good chance of getting some really good pictures there, without hours of post-processing. I have had SO many cameras, most all brands, and have NEVER been truly happy with the photos as shot. Now I am. (Yes, I will still adjust levels and sharpening, but 30 seconds now, not 30 minutes. And if I HAVE to I really can skip it.)Best feature by far for me is the touch screen. I can tap on what I want the subject to be, and BOOM, focus/snap are instant! Beginning my life-long camera love with a Kodak Instamatic 30-something years ago, this is just amazing to me.My only negatives are the price (ouch!), the menu complexity, and the lame front grip, but none of these affect my love for the camera. I'd really give it 10 stars if I could! For a beer lovin' snapper with champagne photograph tastes, this camera really hits the spot.Update 8/25/13I've had this camera now for almost a year and a half, and I still give it 5 stars. For the past many months I've had the Panny 25 1.4 lens stuck on it and I can't make myself take it off. That lens and this camera work so well together they are true photographic soul mates. I am astounded by my own pictures sometimes. :)", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "The camera that shouldn't be, but is!", "Author": "Relentless \"skepticalbeliever\"", "ReviewID": "RZNHP6T057EFB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A bit of my usage background: I have been a photography hobbyist and enthusiast for over 20 years. I have owned all sorts of cameras, analog film and digital. SLRs, DSLRs, 110 film, digital Point-and-shoot and so forth. My most recent camera was the venerable Canon 5D MkII which I will use as a comparison basis.The not-so-technical review:The most amazing aspect of this camera, as a photo enthusiast, is that in theory, from what we know about digital photography, it shouldn't be this great. A camera this small should not give a full-frame DSLR a good run for its money. It shouldn't even be a contest between and APS-C and a m3/4 sensor, but it is! Olympus must have found a secret alchemical potion with powerful arcane power because this camera is what I call a true market shaker. A trend-setter. A disruptive technology.Couple years back you could've suggested me to give up my beloved 5D for a m4/3 and I would have laughed at your face for having such ludicrous ideas. Today, with Olympus leading the way, not only would I say you were 100% correct, but in fact, I would go further and say that DSLRs have their days counted in the-high end hobbyist arena. Looking back, the 5D was mighty expensive, it was heavy and bulky, and for most situations not all that much better than the OM-D E-M5 -- in fact, the difference is marginal at best.I also considered the NEX6/7, the Fujifilm EX1 and others. They all sounded equally good, with the exception of available variety of lenses, which tilted the balance for me for this camera.Add to that the fact that there are tons of available premium vintage lenses compatible via converter with the m4/3 format and you get a camera with virtually limitless options for your creativity.The slightly-more-technical review:* ISO performance (noise): in my informal tests with some control shots I took with the 5D at different ISOs, then compared with this little camera, up to ISO 800 it's really a wash both perform very, very similarly. Over 800, however, the 5D has slight edge, but not all that pronounced, to be honest. At ISOs 2000+ the 5D wins out, but neither produce acceptable noise levels without heavy post-processing noise reduction.* Video: I don't record video all that often, but the 5D video settings were archaic even if it produced beautiful 1080p videos. The OMD video is just as gorgeous and the settings are very intuitive.* Auto-Focus: The OMD is far superior to the 5D MK II in this respect. I cannot fathom why a camera with a sensor 1/2 the size of the 5D's can focus so wickedly fast. No question, at least in my usage.* Shutter Lag: none to speak of.* User-friendliness: here is where I took 1/2 star off. In as amazing as this camera is, if you are not well versed in photography or have good tech sense, you would have a hard time figuring out how to customize you camera to make the best of it. It's like a having a Lamborghini stuck in second gear. They packed too many buttons and nobs and wheels together and the menus can be overwhelming if you do not know what you are doing. The 5D was much easier to use and readily intuitive.* manuals: another 1/2 star loss for this camera. The 5D had two decent manuals, a quick reference and even a pocket reference card. This camera has a \"manual\" which is just reference and nothing else. Other than that you are on your own. No reason why a $1000 camera shouldn't have a comprehensive manual hard copy.* EVF vs OVF: In spite of the fact that the EVF is (and likely) will never be as they real thing (OVF), I'm beginning to like it -- a lot. The ability to see exactly what the picture will look like, the ability to see live depth-of-field is so important to me that I'm willing to forgo the beauty and crispiness of a real OVF.* Battery life: The OMD EM5 has decent battery life, but it just doesn't come even close to the 5D. I could shoot for days, hundreds and hundreds of pictures with the 5D and not have to charge. But this is a completely unfair comparison given that the 5D had lots of electro-mechanical parts, where as the EM5 are purely electronic (thus more battery hungry), in addition of course to the OLED touch screen and the EVF that probably suck quite a bit of juice.TL;DR:This camera shouldn't exist. If it did it shouldn't be this good. But ... it does exist and, yes, it is that good. Unless you are a professional photographer making a living off your camera(s), there really is no good reason to own a bulky, clunky DSLR anymore. If you are looking or planning to take the jump to the mirrorless camera world, you simply cannot go wrong with this camera.2013-05-08 update:After more thorough and real world testing, I have couple of caveats to add to this review.Noise: while at first it seemed as if this camera delivered noise levels on par with the 5DMkII up to ISO 800 (see above), on real usage noise is definitely an issue above ISO 400, specially on low light. I have to run NR software on every other picture I've shot above ISO 400.  That used not to be the case for the 5D until ISOs above 1600. So now I can really see the difference.Navigation/Menu UX: in short a horrible mess. An intricate labyrinthine set of menus with a cornucopia of options and settings for even the most obscure of use cases that will make your head spin and you will not find the setting you are actually looking for. Oh, and heavens forbid you reset your custom settings, you aren't getting those back any time soon. A big, big swing-and-miss on Olympus part.I considered lowering the rating to 3 from the original 4, but decided against it because all in all the camera is worth its salt and doesn't deserve a low 3-star rating.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A giant leap in the M4/3 category and compact system cameras.", "Author": "Matthias Lambert \"Renaisance Dad\"", "ReviewID": "R142C55MRTU3TD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are many great reviews that cover the details and functions in depth and they are super helpful.  I'll just touch on the feel and transition from my GH1/EPL-1/GF1...First it is small, I mean really small.  It is maybe an inch taller than my GF1 and really it is only the EVF, it is nearly the same as my EPL-1 and this is a camera packing so much ability and functions it could easilly be mistaken as a P&S; with a pancake lens attached.  The first thing I notice is the speed at which it focuses and the shutter snaps to action.  On my GF1 it was quick but never fast, and I often missed candids of my kids unless I had the flash for fill, with the GH1 I almost always got the shot, by shooting with a fast lens, with the OM-d I find myself getting 2 or 3 images as fast as I can blink.  The marketing is dead on it is fast and even with the kit 12-50 lens a slower lens compared to the primes available, it snaps to action and at the 12mm wide end even adapts decently to low light indoor shots at higher ISO settings.  I am equally impressed with the 12-50 lens compared to the 14-42/45 that came with my other bodies.  The older lens combo seemed to be a starter pack to let you unpack and begin shooting.  This lens seems to be a thought out full functioning travel lens, offering a middle ground tele at 50mm and a pleasing 12mm wide angle lens for the group shot or larger composition shots.  Even the click ring for the Macro function is well thought out and locks to eliminate any accidental switches.  The images while I would say are above average in my novice hands, compared to my past attempts, are more than adequate and most likely any flaw is my fault as the photographer.  The video mode is sharp, and the IBIS makes those rudimentary panning scenes seem almost tripod mounted in their steady movement, the focus in AF is a little less predictable but sharp, and in MF it is fast and accurate, with superb color capture and exposure adjustment.  I love the extra dial on top as well as the ability to program functions I find most usefull, while some have complained about the menu and the depth which you have to dive in for adjustment, I found it fairly intuative and with less than an hour of navigating and playing with the menus I am comfortable with the set-up and have even found myself changing the function buttons on the fly when I found myself in a different circumstance or setting.In brief:  If you are considering switching to Micro Four thirds, this is a capable camera to make you park the full size DSLR in the closet and go out and shoot great images.  If you have a micro fourt thirds body already, this is the best one available and depending on your style of shooting or needs will certain out perform them all for stills and shy of the GH2 with video hack, it will rival all of them for video capabilities especially with the IBIS on native lens.  Battery life is less than I am accostomed to 350-400 images with very rare flash usage, but the new EVF and higher resolution OLED screen as well as the 5-axis IBIS are likely using up the battery at a higher rate than past bodies.  When batteries become readilly available it will not matter, but as of May 13th I have yet to recieve either the Olympus OEM battery or an aftermarket battery ordered at the time of delivery.I would recomend this camera to anyone considering it.  It is a joy to use and I find myself grabbing it everytime I go outside or leave the house, and I was already shooting lots, this camera begs to be played with.  The art filters while most are gimmicky or able to be replicated on PP, they are sharp and worth using if you shoot or tend to rely on jpegs, and the results are impressive.  I have printed a few up to 11x14 already in jpeg with random art filters and there is little to no degradation in the quality of the image.  My wife who loves good images but doesn't want to learn anything new rgarding photography has snatched it up numerous times in place of her EPL-1 and remarked how amazing it is comparatively and easy to use.  Obviously for a $850 difference in price it should be better, but in iAuto mode she has made some very worthy prints and the IQ was spot on.I would have given 5 stars but the detached flash, & battery life(lack of spares) cost it a little.  4 1/2 stars would be my rating.

Anyone who doesn't need weatherproofing.....new M10 is a better choice for you.I've owned many cameras and have taken thousands of images for many years and it wasn't until I bought this camera that I discovered just how little I knew about the complex issues involving the capture of truly great images.  This camera allows a huge range of adjustments that are not available in the typical consumer rebel like camera.  That is why this camera would appeal to the pro and advanced amateur.

I've tried DSLRs in the past but found that in practice I don't carry them around because of size and weight. The Canon S95 has the features I wanted (manual controls, relatively fast lens, good sensor, pocketability), but I wanted a more capable camera when hiking and traveling. I briefly tried both the Nikon J1 and Panasonic GH2 before picking the Olympus E-M5.The E-M5 viewfinder is an EVF similar to the GH2's but feels smoother to me. I love the E-M5's sharp screen, although it does have a slight bluish tint when viewing at an angle. The touch screen might be useful when you want to tell the camera what to focus on. It feels nicer than the GH2's but still too awkward for me to use regularly. The viewfinder adds a bit of bulk to the top. If you don't need a viewfinder, consider the more compact GX1 or PEN cameras.When it comes to convenience vs. image quality, I highly value convenience. I know a tripod will give me better photos but in practice I don't end up carrying it around. Thus an image stabilizer is a nice feature for me. The E-M5's image stabilization works well on the 14-42 kit lens, and video stabilization is amazing. I've not tried the camera on a longer lens yet. The \"maglev\" image stabilizer has a hum, about as loud as my computer fan. I could hear it in my quiet house but not when I went hiking. The hum is there all the time, even when you have image stabilization turned off. If the noise may bother you, try this in person before you buy.The menus offer lots of options, perhaps too many for most people. There are menus that control other menus. There are menus that control other menus that control other menus. There are multiple control systems (main menu, live control, live guide, super control panel, touch screen), and options to allow using multiple systems of these simultaneously, with buttons to cycle among them. There are menu options that are confusingly expressed as double negatives (\"XYZ Off: Off\" turns it on). The manual isn't great at explaining the menu options; I find that searching the web works better. As confusing as the menus are, I'd rather have too many than too few, and have found lots of options that make the camera work the way I want it to work. If you prefer the camera work out of the box without fiddling, this one may not be the best choice.I love the two control dials on top. The left dial is meant to be used with the thumb, but it's a little bit of a stretch for me. The right dial is around the shutter button and is easy to turn with the index finger. Both dials are solid and \"clicky\". Since the right dial is easier to use I swapped the dial functions to put the primary function on the right dial. I love that most buttons are reprogrammable; I've already reconfigured all of them. The buttons are a little mushy (because of weathersealing) and occasionally it registers 0 or 2 times instead of 1. The play and Fn2 buttons are annoying to get to. The button setup is disappointing but the dials make up for it.Holding the camera feels good but using the top control dials while also holding the camera with the right hand isn't great. I've not yet figured out a way to hold the camera that makes both my thumb and pinky happy. Given the camera's weight, it may be easier to hold with the add-on landscape grip (HLD-6). Removing the triangle pieces on the sides helps quite a bit (the plastic pops off and then the metal ring easily comes off without damaging either).For details on the features and menu options, browse the manual available on Olympus's site (...).  This manual contains many more details than the printed manual that comes with the camera. Load it on your phone or tablet so you can refer to it when you're out shooting something and need to search for the right menu option.I've not written about image quality in this review. Three reasons: 1- I've only had the camera for a few days; 2 - as a point & shoot upgrader,  I don't have good comparisons with similarly sized cameras; and 3 - I only have the kit lens at the moment.  I pick cameras based on the most I can get, for my needs, in a given size and weight. The S95 is as good as I can get while fitting in my pocket. The E-M5 looks to be as good as I can get from a non-DSLR.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "E-M5 review from a Canon perspective (hint, this canon user is switching)", "Author": "s. Ip", "ReviewID": "R2BQO1GY34DWPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When Olympus gave a great deal on the E-M5 with 12-50 kit over the holidays, and the CFO/wife gave the ok, I took a leap of faith and ordered it. Ok, it wasn't such a big leap as I already had friends who sold all their Canon gear (multiple FF DSLR and L lenses) after getting the OM-D.I expected to like the OM-D but I didn't expect it would basically become my go to camera. So with that lets start with the Cons and why it still get 5 stars even with cons.1) Continuous AFYes it just isn't going to work very well. But if people are honest with themselves most of us don't use tracking/servo/continuous AF that much. And if you dig a bit deeper, Continuous AF is not perfect on any camera.On entry level DSLRs continuous AF is a bit of a sweep under the carpet subject with the manufacturers, it works sort of but don't expect it to really work well. You need to upgrade to the higher end bodies with cross type AF sensor points to get decent continuous AF. And even then, it's not magically going to work there are lots of settings you can/need to fiddle with to suit the situation you are shooting. And after all that the camera's not going to deliver perfect results, it still can miss focus.In fact you might need to spend the truly big bucks for a 5D mk 3 or 1D to get anywhere near perfect continuous AF results. And I doubt that it's even possible to be perfect.Given all the considerations above, continuous AF is a tiny tiny flaw not important to everyday shooting.2) Battery lifeYou are going to need multiple batteries for situations like travelling. But as batteries are small it's not a big problem.3) Not pocketable (mostly)You can slip some of the other mirror-less cameras into a jacket pocket. But as I do care about my gear I never would do that anyhow as it's a good way to scratch the screen or lens.And now onto the Pros:1) IBIS or In body image stabilizationA few years back when image stabilization came onto the market there was Olympus, pentex and Sony using in body sensor shift IS and Nikon and Canon using lens based systems. At the time Nikon and Canon marketed their as better because it stabilized the image for the AF sensor as well so AF worked better. Forward to today and Olympus is showing why IBIS could be better. Simply put lens based systems are limited to up down and left right motion. Where as with the new multi axis IBIS olympus can stabilize for twisting motion along the lens axis and also automatically level a shot.In a nut shell IBIS works and it works really well. And unlike the lens based system you only pay for it once. There's no extra cost to add to the lenses.2) Weather sealingYou are not going to find a kit for this price with full weather sealing from anyone else at the moment, expect maybe pentax. This is a big plus for me. You don't want to have to worry about rain especially if you are travelling. With this you just slap on the weather sealed kit lens and shoot to your heart's content. People have put these cameras in the shower (including my crazy friend) and they came out no different except maybe a bit cleaner.3) View finderI just don't want a camera that doesn't have one. And I don't want to buy a regular mirror-less body then having to add stuff to it. So I love that it's built in. Now it's not going to be as good as a optical VF and it's not the highest resolution EVF on the market. But it works, and for beginners it shows you what generally the exposure is going to look like as well.4) 9 fps burst rateThat's faster than any entry level DSLRs and many semi-pro/professional DSLRs. Some would say it's useless without good continuous AF but it's nice that it's there. It will work for situations like a kid blowing out candles on a cake.5) Weight/sizeI was never one to complain about the weight of my canon kit. I took 25 lb worth of stuff on a trip to Banff and 15 lb of stuff to europe. But to be honest about it it's mighty refreshing to carry something that weights next to nothing. And doing it all with a much smaller pack is great. Makes street shooting so much easier. And the less intimidating size of the OM-D makes people notice you less.6) PrimesIt's not that DSLRs don't have primes. It's just these ones are smaller. So you can carry a set that would cover your needs without any penalty in size and weight.7) DOFYou get more. Which some people would make you think is a bad thing because it's harder to get blurred out foreground and background. It's really a taste thing for you but I feel people mistake bokeh as a magic ingredient that make any photo good. It doesn't and so we end up with tons of shots where bokeh is the subject of the photo. If all you want is blurred out stuff just smear some grease on you lens.What the greater DOF for any focal length and aperture setting means if that with m4/3 systems you can utilizes those fast primes without having nothing in focus. So when I take photos of people for example I can get their whole face in focus instead of just an eye lash. This means better low light performance. So while a FF frame camera might have better high ISO noise performance, you need to stop down more to get the same amount of stuff in focus. Which means you need to go up the ISO scale, meaning that high ISO advantage is often gone.Also, primes set to the same aperture size still tends to be faster than zoom lenses (look up t-stop for info). And because with M4/3 it's easy to carry a lot of primes this makes m4/3 low light performance something that could actually be quite good.8) Software featuresCanon needs to improve on this. Sure photo filters can be done in photoshop but for an average weekend photographer it's a nice to have and easily enough to implement. Other things like the show you what you get as it expose for long exposure is a god send for long exposure and astro photography.9) JPEGOlympus does have really good jpeg engine. About as good as anyone can do without serious effort manually converting RAW.10)White balance. It's pretty good. Will still get it wrong at times but out of camera it's not bad at all.Anyhow by now I think you get the idea.

I've shot on a Canon 5DMKII for the past two or three years.  I have to say I'm rather impressed with this camera.  IQ is excellent, tilting screen is actually quite useful, and it does OK at high ISO.  Coming from full frame it's a little hard to get used to the shallow DOF though.  My style has evolved around shallow DOF and having to consider the background more thoroughly is difficult for me to get used to...I switched because I was tired of carrying around lots of gear, and the OM-D is perfect for that!  I love how small and light it is, and it still fits in my hand pretty well (although nothing could feel better than a large SLR body)My disappointments with the camera are:-The viewfinder (its difficult to get used to an electronic viewfinder after using an SLR for so long)-High ISO performance compared to the 5DMKII-Complex menus (I have to dig in unusual spots for things that should be out in the open)-Small user manual (doesn't even describe what half of the menu functions do!  Leaves me to dig online to find answers)With all that said, I'm pleased with the camera... Lots of my complaints are things that I will get used to in time, and It's unfair to hold this camera up against the 5DMKII...  Just thought that these comparisons might help someone thinking about making the same transition that I did.I won't be selling my Canon any time soon, but the OM-D will take its place for my lanscape, travel, and day-to-day shooting.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera in a tiny package", "Author": "R. Ortiz", "ReviewID": "R2F0NBI4YQ9GK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Nikon user for many years, but I wanted something small to take places where my D90 would be too large and bothersome.I got the Olympus OM-D EM-5, just to try it out. I intended to sell it if it didn't meet my quality expectations.Well, it turns out I'm now selling the D90.Image quality:The OM-D produces images that are just as good in terms of colors and sharpness as the D90.It has a tad less dynamic range, but better high ISO performance.Video:Much better than the D90. That isn't saying much, because the D90 is not know for its great video capabilities.It shoots HD up to 1080i and can focus while filming (an iffy proposition, but there it is).The 12-50 kit lens was made for video. The power zoom mode is silent and smooth (the manual zoom mode is better for stills).I don't care much about video but it might be important to you.Autofocus:Same as the D90!That blew my mind, because I had never seen a mirrorless camera come close to the focusing speed of a DSLR.The OMD is a tiny bit faster in some cases and a tiny bit slower in others. Most of the time the difference is imperceptible.In any case, it is blazingly fast.Continuous Autofocus:Decent, but not as good. I never use continuous focus, so for me this is a moot point, but if you shoot sports it might matter to you.Viewfinder:The electronic viewfinder is a joy to use. It is crisp and clear even in low light.I can set it to show me the blown highlights and crushed shadows so I can adjust the exposure BEFORE taking the picture!With the DSLR I would have to \"chimp\" by looking at the photo after it was taken, adjust, take another photo, adjust, etc.Configurability:You can configure three buttons in the camera (plus one in the 12-50 lens) to access the functions you use the most.The dials are also configurable. For the rest of the functions you have the \"Super Control Panel\".Touch Screen:I'm a button guy and usually hate menus, so I thought I would have no use for the touch screen, but the \"Super Control Panel\" works very well.At the touch of a button you bring up a screen with the most important settings.Touching each setting selects it and then you can use the dials or arrows to set their value.It very fast and easy. No menu digging. Almost as good as the D90's dedicated buttons.(BTW, you do have to dig into the menus to enable the Super Control Panel. For some dumb reason, it is disabled by default.)Size, Weight:This camera is amazingly small and light. Especially compared to the Nikon D90.If you put the minuscule Panasonic 14mm pancake lens on it, it may even fit in a large pocket.I find it very easy to handle, but people with large hands could have problems.The camera feels very solid and well built.Neck Strap:I hate neck straps. I really, really hate them.For this camera, things are worse than usual.The neck strap attachment clips on the camera dig into your palms and are uncomfortable when you're holding the camera.I removed the clips and attached a wrist strap instead. A camera this small and light is better with a wrist strap anyway.Someone already posted a photo of this in the Amazon listing so you can see what that looks like.Mysterious Noise:As reported in many reviews, the image stabilization makes a mystery noise. It is really more like a very faint whisper.You can only hear it in a very quiet room, and then just barely. It is not an issue.Conclusion:All in all, I find the Olympus OM-D to be equivalent to a consumer-level DSLR, but in a much more convenient package.But the most important factor is that this camera is fun to use.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Rare quality product", "Author": "peevee", "ReviewID": "R2V17RHFX9ABG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is this nowadays really rare kind of product which is not junk, not something artificially limited by marketers trying to protect their higher-priced products or bean counters \"saving\" a couple cents here and there to the detriment of the customer. The kind of product which pulled Apple from the brink of death. The kind of quality which can only be found in top of the line products of most other companies, such as 1D line from Canon and Dx line from Nikon (which are in totally different class of large and heavy professional equipment costing many thousands of dollars, so should not even be directly compared). They threw everything at it: great design, magnesium-alloy body, weather sealing (unique among mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras), the best sensor they could make, the fastest processor they make, the new and the best image stabilization system, 3-dial interface with plenty of buttons (again unique this side of professional cameras), bright and beautiful tiltable OLED display with capacitive touch interface, fast electronic viewfinder with eye sensor, insane configurability, fast sequential shooting, all kinds of bracketing, fastest CDAF anybody makes, new chemistry Li battery with higher capacity while still small and light... You can find some of the features in other cameras, but not even close to all of them together.I am not saying it is perfect, nothing is perfect, but they made it as close to perfect as they could at this size/price and current technology level, and it is so rare that the camera is worthy to become an instant classic. This is absolutely the camera you should get if you want a great camera but not ready for the size, weight, mandatory complexity and price of professional cameras.One great feature of the camera is the range the available ways to use it suitable for every skill level and a such allowing one to grow (and different members of a family with different skills use it to their satisfaction). You can use iAuto with simple touchscreen-based controls. You can use a scene mode, with a choice of specific situations and some adjustments. Or you can use PASM modes, with two control dials (which are not usually available in entry or medium level DSLRs) and Super Control Panel with advanced settings.Another great feature is the ability to do in camera things which usually require shooting RAW and then post-processing them in some external software like Adobe Lightroom. For example, usually if you shoot an object or portrait against a light source or bright background, either the bright part will be blown out, or the object way too dark - or even both. With the E-M5, you press Fn2 (if it is set to \"Multi-function\" as by default), spin the control dials to set the curve to your satisfaction and shoot. And you also can shoot RAW, set the settings after the fact and produce a JPEG (or several) right there in the camera, using any setting and even any art effects. This greatly reduces the need to use a computer to get good-looking pictures.If you are coming to interchangeable lens cameras from point-and-shoots, you should understand that the choice of lenses is exactly what will limit the quality of your pictures now. If you are going to use only a kit zoom, don't buy this, buy Canon G1 X 14.3 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Lens Full 1080p HD Video and 3.0-inch Vari-Angle LCD instead. With the E-M5, at least add Olympus M.Zuiko 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 R Micro ED Digital Zoom Lens (Black), Olympus runs promotion with a camera with a kit and it's a great value, simple and very useful. Even with 12-50 you will appreciate the extra brightness in the 40-50 range.The camera is good, the lenses are the bottleneck. Thankfully, Micro Four Thirds is the first and currently the biggest mirrorless interchangeable lens system on the market, way ahead of everybody else, and the only one supported by not one but TWO camera manufactures (the other being Panasonic), plus the usual battery of third-party lens producers. If you are new to the system, you probably should buy it with one of the kit lenses though, unless you choose the so far only bright zoom for the system, Panasonic H-HS12035 LUMIX G X VARIO 12-35mm/F2.8 ASPH X Series Lens. If only for the discount in a kit.The choice is not so easy as it seems. 12-50 can do more, but 14-42 II R is almost twice as light and twice as short when retracted. The advantages of 12-50 are:1) extra 12-14 range, extremely useful for traveling, shooting landscapes/cityscapes/architecture etc. But the 14-42 can be equipped with Olympus WCON-P01 Wide Angle Converter For Olympus 14-42mm MFT Lens for as wide as 11 mm, or even Olympus FCON-P01 Fisheye Converter For Olympus 14-42mm MFT Lens for 120 degrees of view in fish-eye perspective.2) mild macro capability. But you can use Olympus MCON-P01 Macro Converter for M.Zuiko 14-42mm II, 14-150mm, 40-150mm Lens (Silver) on 14-42, and it is even better on the 40-150.3) extra length in 43-50 range. It is pretty dark on the 12-50, usable mostly in daylight. Still useful. You can use 2x digital teleconverter in 22-25 range on the 14-42, the result will be worse, but not by too much - still useable in daylight. Teleconvertable 85-100 is not achievable on 14-42 though.4) motorized zoom. Done well, different speeds with the fastest pretty fast. But the manual zoom is good too.5) weather sealing. This feature on the camera is useless without a weather-sealed lens. This sealed the deal for me. :)But get the Pana 12-35 and/or bright primes for better quality, especially in the dark.Things which could be better:1) C-AF+TR is very unreliable, use regular C-AF and keep your target in focus box instead.2) Long end of the 12-50 is too dark to use inside.3) There is no digital zoom other than 2x \"digital teleconverter\". 1.1x, 1.2x, 1.4x and 1.7x could also be useful to help focus and avoid cropping in postprocessing and use more of the sensor area than 1/4th which 2x uses, for better image quality.4) Small size makes some buttons (especially Review and Fn1) cramped for my large hands. Thankfully the most important - control dials, shutter, Video Record and Fn2 - are comfortable. Some say Olympus HLD-6 Battery Holder helps, I think small size and weight are worth it.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really good pro camera", "Author": "A Gottschald", "ReviewID": "R3HJAHFOMIHAOJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Years ago I bought Canon the FD system three bodies and a lot of prime lenses.

Wanting to move into digital photography I looked around for a suitable system but until micro four thirds came along nothing was any different to the old days. My first micro 4/3 camera was a Lumix it was good so I bought lumix and olympus lenses and an adapter for my old Canon primes. It wasn't until I bought the OM-D E-M5 that I rediscovered the joy of using my old Canon lenses. The fact that the OMD has an image stabilizer built into the body is great, I can now use my 500mm cat lens hand held and get blur free pictures. because of the multiplication ratio  that's like holding a thousand mm on a 35mm camera.It's really wonderful I'm using lenses from six different quality makers.

Before that, I shot journalistic assignments with the Canon 5D and decided on picking up my current Micro Four-Thirds outfit to shed most of the weight. The biggest plus of M43 is the size and weight. I can't emphasize how awesome it was to travel around without collapsing under the weight of my equipment. The smaller profile also makes it easier to shoot candid street portraits. In my experience, people tend to ignore a small camera like the OM-D and stare straight into, or dodge away from, a bulky DSLR.That said, I still occasionally miss the depth of field control I get with the 5D so if you like creamy bokeh in every shot you take you might want to think twice about replacing your full-frame or APS-C gear or add the Olympus M.Zuiko 75mm f/2 to your wish list (it weighs only 305 grams!).-Handling-Despite how small the OM-D is (I feel the product shots of the camera online make the camera appear larger than it actually is), it's quite comfortable to grip. The two dials on the right-hand side of the camera fit just right against the thumb and index fingers and make it easy to toggle through aperture settings and exposure compensation.  Just don't count on using the Fn1 / Fn2 keys which let you bind shooting settings like ISO, AEL, etc. too often if you have big hands. Those buttons are a bit harder to reach and I find myself rarely hitting Fn2, which I've bound to ISO. Fortunately the Auto ISO function works very well to compensate for poor button positioning.-Menu / In-Camera Software-You could tweak just about any setting on the OM-D, which makes it really easy for photographers to adjust the camera's behavior to their liking. For all the customization Olympus allows on this camera, the menu is fairly intuitive for a lot of common settings (flash, burst modes, timers, metering, autofocus, image stabilization, etc.). You could also access these common settings by hitting [OK] while shooting, which brings up a nice semi-transparent menu that overlays what you see in the viewfinder. Just keep in mind that some less frequently accessed settings such as the sleep mode toggle are buried away (sleep is hidden in \"Disp/Beep/PC\"--no rhyme or reason here).-Performance-Micro Four-Thirds in my mind had always seemed like a portable backup to DSLR's, trading in some speed and image quality for lesser weight and size. This is not the case at all with the OM-D. In daylight, I found autofocus to be very fast with the two lenses I own (12mm f/2.0 and 45mm f/1.8). I'd put the 12mm f/2.0 autofocus performance near that of the 24-105mm f/4 (ie. lightning fast) with the 45mm f/1.8 coming in just a tad slower. Both are very accurate and resolve an excellent amount of detail through the OM-D. In low-light conditions, focus is a bit slower but manages to lock on as long as there's some tonal contrast in your subject.The only issue I have with the OM-D's performance is its boot-up time. It takes about a couple of seconds to turn on the camera and snap the first shot, whereas on the 5D it was near-instantaneous.Image stabilization is a winner, which should be huge for anyone who does a lot of low-light / macro work sans tripod. I've managed to get shake-free shots for exposures as long as 1/3\" - 1/6\" _without_ leaning or supporting myself against anything.-Image Quality (Note: these reflect my experiences shooting in RAW)-With a sensor its size packing in 16 megapixels, the OM-D produces excellent output. Images are very clean up through ISO 1600. From ISO 3200 and up, there's a bit more luminance noise,  but this noise resembles film grain and is rather pleasant to look at. Colors and saturation are spot on and look natural, there are no colors that seem over- or under-saturated and no shifted hues. Dynamic range is very wide as well  and it's quite easy to avoid clipping (blowing out highlights) with the live histogram display.-Who should buy the OM-D?-The OM-D is an excellent compact body with a  plenty of great lenses available for it. Casual, still-life, street and travel photographers will especially enjoy the camera, which packs a lot of performance in a tiny footprint. However, the camera's not for everyone. The OM-D will set you back about one grand and a few hundred more for a nice prime or kit zoom. Those who are getting into photography will get more out of an entry-level DSLR with an affordable 30mm prime. Portraitures who need subject isolation and sports photographers who need as much speed as they can get will probably not replace their gear with an OM-D anytime soon (although they might make good backups / second camera for weekend shoots). There are also a couple of close competitors around similar price points including Sony's NEX-7 and Fuji X100S, to look at.

I just had to have this one though, and it lived up to/exceeded my expectations.  I'm certain it won't be found cheap on the used market for some time, so I splurged due to the rebate offer from Olympus.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid through and through", "Author": "King", "ReviewID": "R14XLC6Q3SGOMK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll break this camera down by some of the more flashy features it lists, and what I got out of them.IBIS:Absolutely phenomenal. With my previous camera body (GF1), I'd often have to trash pictures taken in dim lighting due to camera shake. Every now and then, I'd have a keeper. With the OM-D, it's reversed. I rarely have to worry about camera shake being what prevents a shot from being a keeper. Often times, I can pass the camera to someone who doesn't know how to properly stabilize a camera for low-light conditions with their hands, and the shot will come out camera-shake free. It's a terrific tool for stills, but where it also shines just a brilliantly is for videography. I'm a very, very passionate videographer, and the IBIS allows for steadicam-like image stabilization and goes miles towards making your footage look professional.Built-in EVF: This one is great. I don't use it terribly often as I like the flexibility that screen composing offers, but for bright, sunny days it's an absolute shot-saver. It's wonderfully sharp, and every now and then I'll use it instead of the touch-screen for composing just because it's a fun way to compose your shots. I've definitely got a gripe about it though: the EVF auto-detect switch is far too sensitive to make it practical. I'll be tapping on the screen, and the overly-sensitive EVF detector will make it switch to the EVF when it's not when I intended. Therefore, I heavily recommend you manually switch between EVF and touchscreen composing.ISO performance: This in combination with the IBIS has made many a keeper out of an otherwise trash-worthy shot. I can push it up to ISO 6400 and really not worry too much, especially if I'm just posting photos to facebook. You CAN go further than that, but at that point, the shots really do become too noisy for my taste. However, if I convert the files to black and white, they look like a classy, grainy black and white shot. Overall, terrific job on Olympus' end. Gives you 80-90% of the image quality of a full-frame sensor, but with a camera body infinitely smaller, lighter, more discrete and more portable.Body / handling: The camera feels absolutely terrific in one's hand. It feels solid and sturdy. I've dropped it more times than I'd care to admit, and it works just as fine as the day I got it. The buttons ARE awkwardly small and cheap-feeling, though. When you press any of the buttons on the back of the camera, it feels soft and has no satisfying click. I know it's a necessary part fo the weather-sealing of the body, but it's still something that doesn't quite mesh with the high-quality feel of the other aspects of this great camera.Weather sealing: This was a huge reason for my purchase of the camera. I often go out fishing and to the beach, and I wanted a camera that could keep up with the action and the elements. Well, suffice to say, it can, with one large caveat: You MUST have the 12-50 kit lens attached. Otherwise, the camera may as well not be sealed at all. That being said, if you do have the camera outfitted with a weather-sealed lens, it can take some serious abuse. When boating, we were caught in a thunderstorm so bad, the sky was literally black with storm clouds. Water was EVERYWHERE. I took about a hundred shots during the storm no problem. This camera can take most anything up to being actually dropped in water. I would still be careful with it around sand dunes, as no amount of weather sealing can really defend a device against sand. Sand is on a league of its own in terms of messing with equipment.Video: As I mentioned in the IBIS section, video looks fantastic on this camera. Here's an example of the kind of quality it can pump out https://vimeo.com/50654415. The camera has for all intents and purposes replaced my Canon Vixia HF10, and that's saying something.Autofocus: It depends on which lens you have equipped. If you're like me and you hung on to your terrific panasonic 20mm f/1.7 from the early days of M43, you're going to want to step up to a lens with faster AF. Otherwise, the AF rarely is a problem provided you're in S-AF mode. In terms of tracking moving targets, the OM-D isn't all that terrific. I have found that using C-AF to track flowers on a windy day works quite well, although using it to track a person's movements rarely works. The camera gets distracted way to easily and is a step down from just using a single AF point.Burst mode: Really quite impressive. I used this feature quite often when I first got the camera, but the editing consequences of taking so many similar photos has lead me to use the feature much more sparingly. It's still very, very impressive however. Good for catching animals in motion.Lens selection: This really is the biggest, most important part of the review IMHO. A good camera body is nothing without some nice glass to accompany it. And in this respect, the M43 system shines like no other. Apart from the kit zoom lens, I prefer primes, and between my 12, 17, and 45 M.Zuiko lenses, there is narry a situation I'm not able to take a great picture at. A major gripe about this is that so few of the lenses are truly weather-sealed. It basically means that if I want a weather-sealed camera, I need to compromise image quality and use the kit lens (although to the kit lense's credit, it does a great job of being a kit lens. The macro mode on it is a terrific touch and I've used it for many shots). Otherwise, feel safe if this is your first foray in to the wold of M43. The lens selection makes for a camera system that you won't soon replace.Finishing thoughts: I love this camera. If it weren't for the annoying EVF detection issues and the lack of good weather-sealed prime lenses, this would be a 5-star review. But to be fair, there's no such thin as a perfect camera, so 4-stars is not bad. I attack it to my black rapid camera sling and take it with me to almost every place I go, because as the old addage goes: the best camera is the one you have available. The OM-D is light yet sturdy, it's Image quality is professional-grade without being too intimidating to your subjects. And to me, that's the entire draw of the M43 system. It makes good photography more accessible to more people, and although some snobby professional photographers might take issue with that out of fear of becoming obsolete, I believe that it helps to empower the public by allowing non-professionals and professionals alike to tell their stories more strongly.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice Camera that fits my needs", "Author": "Paris Tx Guy", "ReviewID": "R148P4GKRPNXY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have tried most of the smaller interchangeable lens cameras and am sticking with this one.

Most likely, the camera you received did not have the latest firmware. Mine came with version 1.2 and I upgraded to 1.5. Version 1.2 emits a soft hissing sound whenever you turn it on. This is because the image stabilization is always active when the camera is on. With version 1.5, i.s. is only active when you press the shutter button. And you can configure i.s. to turn on when you half-press the shutter button. Just be sure you've got a fully charged battery installed when you do this. When I upgraded the firmware it first installed version 1.4 and then I had to go through the same process again for 1.5. See: [...]After spending some time becoming familiar with the working of the camera I'd then see the user guide at DPReview. They've got some great suggestions that are not evident from reading even the full user guide. See: [...]If you're thinking of buying additional lenses, I'd wait until you've lived with the 12-50mm kit lens for awhile. 12mm translates to 24mm in the 35mm world and is on the border of \"Ultra-Wide\". 50mm is a moderate telephoto and, with 16 mega-pixels, you can stretch this by cropping the photo. You may find that this lens is all you need. The rather limited aperture (f3.5 to f6.3) is mitigated by the great image stabilization and low noise at high ISO settings. The OM-D replaces my Panasonic G-1 so I already have a small collection of lenses which work great on the OM-D:Panasonic 7-14mm f4.0 zoom: Great for landscape photography but can give distorted perspectives if not careful.Panasonic 20mm f1.7: Great for available light photos. Razor sharp even wide open.Panasonic 25mm f1.4: Twice the cost and twice the size of the 20mm. Why did I buy this? Because the 20mm is a mild wide angle lens and I wanted a true 'normal' lens. Even sharper than the 20mm.Olympus 50mm f2.0 4/3 macro with micro-4/3 adapter. The auto-focus is not available when mounted on my Lumix G-1 but auto-focus does work when mounted on the OM-D (Yeah!) but is slow and has to hunt for the correct focus (Boo!). I recommend getting the Panasonic 45mm f2.8 macro instead.Olympus 40-150mm 4/3 zoom with micro-4/3 adapter. Again, the auto-focus didn't function when on the G-1 and is slow on the OM-D. Also, this is a big heavy lens. But I did get it used for a very low price.Various Nikon lenses with adapter. Don't bother! The manual aperture is a throwback to the 1950's and is unusable. Of course, all such adapted lenses are manual focus. With VR lenses you'll be stuck with the maximum aperture.What's really cool is that all lenses you mount on the OM-D will have image stabilization because it's in the camera!Cheers!", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "A technological breakthrough - buy with confidence", "Author": "David Cohen", "ReviewID": "R36FHDEFZHCQ0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't be more pleased with this camera and this is coming from someone that has been constantly underwhelmed by cameras in the past. In fact, I've been looking for a camera that fits this bill for 15+ years and technology has finally caught up to my desires. You can't really ask for more: well-built small body size, nice selection of reasonably priced high quality lenses, fast and accurate AF, and high quality sharp photos and HD video without requiring much expertise. In the past month I've gone from the Canon G11, my old camera, to the Canon 5D Mark III, Canon 5D Mark II, and Sony NEX 5N and now I'm finally content. It sounds crazy, but for anyone outside of a true professional, I don't think you'll see much difference between the quality of the shots you'll get from this little camera vs the Canon MKIII, an enormous camera with an enormous price tag ($4300 for the body and 24-105 lens). The only real complaint about the OM-D would be that the body could be a little less expensive (although they are hard to come by at retail the retail price so I'm going to say it's \"worth\" it and it would be nice to have a better kit lens option. For anyone outside of the most basic shooter, I strongly recommend ignoring the kit lens, which isn't bad but isn't great, and purchasing the Olympus 45mm f/1.8 and the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 lenses. With these two lenses you'll be covered for just about any standard shot and you'll be rewarded with significantly better quality shots across the board.

That's: gear acquisition syndrome. I have many cameras (from APS-C to full frame DSLRs) and lenses and I have to say this is my favorite camera.Perceivable image quality matches the image quality from current APS-C offerings, this includes entry level and enthusiast DSLRs as well. The feature set is one of the best however. In truth m4/3 sensor is little smaller than APS-C but the difference is negligible. Read on and find out how this camera compensates and in my opinion outmatches many of its APS-C competitors.- Excellent in body stabilization. Most people won't notice this because it just works.The best features are when you don't even know they are there. But I know because I've used other m4/3 cameras and I can nail shots with 2-3 stops less ISO.- Solid Electronic Viewfinder. I prefer it to optical viewfinders on DLSRs. Because it's bright and I can display a histogram which is very useful when manually setting exposure.- Great build quality.- Great controls.- Weather Sealing. I can and I have shot in rain with no issues (keep in mind weather sealed lens should be used when attempting this).- It is tiny. I have a very small Tenba bag that I use for business travel. It fits my Air Mini and this OM-D, as well as bunch of other accessories I bring with me. The camera is great for travel. Not only is the camera small more importantly most lenses are small as well.- Excellent lens selection. m4/3 has some of the best lens selection. And due to small flange distance you can get  adapters for many legacy lens systems. Wanna use old Nikon glass on this camera? You can, just get an adapter. One thing that should be mentioned about m4/3 due to the aspect ratio since the lenses are round, the 4:3 ratio is actually better suited at getting less distortion out of a lens than the traditional 35mm 3:2 ratio. This give m4/3 an edge in getting more quality out of a piece of glass (lens). So in general most lenses for m4/3 are of excellent optical quality.Pros:- Responsive and quick.- Dead on accurate auto focus, which works well even in low light.- Customizability. The way I have my camera setup is I have programed the fn1 button for  focusing and made my half trigger not focus anymore. This is called back focusing. So the camera only focuses when I hold that button. This way I can quickly focus on my subject and then frame the shot as long as I want without losing focus. Since I don't record movies I have reprogrammed my Record button to give me a quick ISO change setting.- Great controls. I especially like exposure compensation and aperture wheels at the top.- Fun. This camera is just fun to use. The tactile feedback you get from it and the build quality really feel good. It is the camera I use 90% of the time.- Image quality. Like I said it matches the image quality you would get from a crop DSLR. In fact I prefer the color better than from my D5100 DSLR.- Looks. Very stylish retro looks. True to the great tradition of the old OM. OM used to be called the \"Leica of SLR\" for it's high quality and small and clever design.Cons:- Noneok there are some things that aren't the best. And could be improved. But they are very minor.- Battery life is average. It's not bad but I would like it to be better.- Position of the strap hooks. They are kind of in the middle of your palms.- Position of the power switch. It's at the back towards the bottom of the camera, kind of an awkward place for it.

So I will be brief.  I upgraded from a Nikon D5100.  The image quality of the stills taken by the OM-D blows away anything I had ever taken with the Nikon, and I loved that camera.PROS:  1.) unbelievable low light ISO performance.  I can shoot at ISO 6400 jpg with little to no noticeable noise.  ISO 6400 is about equal to ISO 1600 on the D5100 in my opinion based on shooting thousands of shots with each camera at various ISOs; 2.) unbelievable image stabilization.  The sensor-based IS works with ANY lens, so you can even stabilize the Panasonic 20mm pancake lens or older Nikon lenses attached with an adapter.  You can shoot as slow as about 1/2 second handheld super sharp with no blur at 20mm or so.  I could only shoot to about 1/15 second on my Nikon with a VR lens and get acceptable results.  I don't carry a tripod anymore; this camera can handle any dark scene you can throw at it handheld.  Even the darkest scene can be captured at 1/4 second exposure at ISO 5000 or ISO 6400, and it looks perfect.  The sensor literally feels like it is floating in space, which you can see in the viewfinder or on the screen once you press the shutter halfway.  This IS works amazing in video as well, it feels like you are walking with a steadicam; 3.) jpg processing is outstanding.  I had to post process all of my Nikon jpg shots b/c they always came out of camera soft.  With the Olympus, I do not need to add any sharpening in post; all jpgs come out of camera razor sharp.  4.) This camera has 2 wheels and many customizable buttons, along with touch screen, so you can have the best of both worlds whether you are a button person or a menu person; 5.) the focus is extremely fast and accurate, 6.) the stock 14-42 lens is so tiny, yet amazingly sharp.  It is like 1/4 the size of the Nikon stock lens.  Other lenses like the panasonic 14mm or 20mm pancake lens make this camera fit in your pocket.CONS: 1.) the buttons and camera in general are too small for my hands; I liked the ergonomics of my old Nikon better.  It felt bigger in my hand.  But that is a sacrifice I am willing to make for the reduced size and weight around my neck or in my bag;  2.) you pretty much have to have noise reduction set to on in order to take long exposure shots (even at ISO 200), which then requires the same amount of time to process.  Otherwise you will get a lot of noise and some \"hot pixels.\"  So a 20 second exposure will take an extra 20 seconds to process before you can shoot again.  This is a problem when shooting fireworks if you want to take another pic immediately.  I didn't have to have long exposure noise reduction turned on my Nikon to get perfectly clean shots at low ISOs.I post all of my good pictures on flickr.  I can honestly say that landscape pics on flickr taken with the OM-D and a good lens are sharper and as detailed as pics taken with the Canon 5D Mark III, Nikon D600 or D800, and the low light capability of the OM-D is as good or better than these full frame beasts, especially when shot with the Panny 20mm F1.7 or Panleica 25mm F1.4.  Plus the camera is so much smaller and lighter than the full frames, which makes it so much more fun to use.  If you shoot general or landscape photography, I think the OM-D is a better choice than any of the full frame Nikons or Canons.  The wider depth of field is an advantage shooting landscape, b/c you can shoot at F1.7 and get most of the frame in focus.  But if you shoot a lot of portrait shots, you can get narrower depth of field using a full frame than you can with a micro 4/3 camera.  However, there are some that say portraits taken with the Olympus 45 F1.8 are amazing, but I don't yet own that lens.

The build quality is good, I feel sturdy when shooting with it.The key selling factor for this piece of gear should be the 5-axises IBIS.

I can repeat all of the wonderful things that are being said about it on other reviews, but I won't waste your time with that. What I'll do is give you my story about how this camera turned me on to the micro43 system and allowed me to leave everything else behind. This is my take as somebody who is a camera junkie, I've been taking pictures and had many cameras since I was about 8 years old, and though I am not a professional photographer, I know a lot about photography and have owned and sold enough equipment to open my own photography studio. So let that be known, I REALLY love photography, I just don't do it for a living.So I initially got this camera to compare it against the NEX-6 (with plans of keeping the NEX-6, thinking that the OM-D would not outdo an APS-C sized sensor camera) as a more compact option to my DSLR, and a travel-friendly camera that can produce high quality photographs. I already had a few lenses for the NEX system, owned an NEX-7, got rid of it, got the NEX-6 primarily for all of its new features and WiFi capabilities, then I started to research the OM-D as it is the NEX-6 top competitor (at the time of this writing) and just fell in love with the camera after just a few days of shooting with it. How in love am I with this camera? (right now) well, I returned the NEX-6, sold all of the lenses I had for the NEX system. Then I continued to shoot the OM-D and I compared the pictures with the shots I was getting from my bulky (and very expensive) 5Dmk3. After a few more weeks, realizing that my 5D and collection of L lenses were getting no love and collecting dust in my closet I decided to sell all of my Canon equipment and invest the money instead of letting it depreciate in my closet. I have not looked back and I am very happy with the OM-D. I now own a few micro43 lenses, I can carry ALL of my equipment (camera, 4 lenses, some filters and a wall-charger) in a light-weight messenger bag, which is something I would never be able to do with my old DSLR.One question I get a lot is \"is this little camera better than a full frame DSLR?\" well, No, hell no! It is not, there is no way in hell I would ever say that this camera is better than the 5D mark 3, are you nuts? But really both of these cameras should not even be compared. The reason why I got rid of my full frame is not because this camera is better, it's because it is much more portable, and still produces spectacular results, however, not better than the 5Dmk3.Perhaps selling all of my photography equipment and diving deep into the micro43 system was a bit extreme, would I recommend others to do the same? I don't know, everyone has different needs. This camera is outstanding but it is NOT a replacement for a professional DSLR for a professional photographer. In my case, I am not a professional, and this camera delivers amazing results, it is a ton of fun to use, and it is very portable for somebody that has to carry a diaper bag, stroller, bottle warmer, and all the other crap my wife makes me carry when we take the baby to the park. So I didn't have the need to keep a bunch of pro equipment that I make not money with.Is this camera perfect? NO IT IS NOT. Here are some gripes I have that can (hopefully) be improved with the next version of the OM-D to make it a 5 star:-The flash sucks, the snap-on flash that comes with it is really not good at all, it's weak and I wish it would at least allow you to bounce the light for a more natural look. Not possible. You will need to buy an external flash to get good flash-photography from the OM-D-Ergonomics have room for improvement. This camera is BEAUTIFUL! but a bit uncomfortable; as my wife says: \"wearing high-hills is uncomfortable but so worth it because they make my legs look amazing\"... True, The OM-D's retro look means that you'll miss some of the advantages in camera ergonomics from the last 30 years. Olympus sells a grip that can be attached, which improves the ergonomics A LOT! but it costs $300 and the retro/vintage look of the camera goes away.-Battery charger is VERY bulky. I had to buy a smaller sized plug-fold-out wall plug unit to recharge the battery, (only $23: Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Olympus) which comes with two additional batteries and it is better than the included battery charger to carry it around.-Battery life could be better, I have to carry at least one extra battery with me to make sure I don't run out of juice at the park chasing the baby.-Start-up time is slow. I try to keep the camera on the OFF position to save battery life, but that means that I can miss that special moment waiting for the camera to start-up after switching it to the ON position. It is very slow to start.Like I said, it is not a perfect camera, but after using it for some time you can get used to its shortcomings and learn to get some really amazing shots. I'm now a micro43 believer and I give this one 4, ok, 4.5 stars!I hope this helps your research on this camera and to make a decision whether to buy it or not. I am really enjoying the portability and the image quality I get from this OM-D, I very much recommended it, and I also recommend the Lumix G vario 12-35mm F2.8 and the Zuiko 75mm F1.8 these two lenses pair up amazingly with this camera, they are not cheap, but like this camera: worth it!", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Couldn't have asked for more!", "Author": "Amadeo Plaza", "ReviewID": "R2NY20RN4R5YWZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my first DSLR camera about four years ago. It was an entry-level Olympus E-420. It's the camera I got my feet wet with. So, I never really invested into it all that much, really only using the kit lens. But it definitely afforded me the opportunity learn more about the craft, and how to use a camera that had all those fancy dials on it. Since then, I've grown to love photography. Specifically, street photography. As my standards of quality steadily rose with my experience, I began using my co-workers hand-me-down (but still newer) Panasonic G1, which was my first exposure to the micro 4/3rds format, EVFs, and what a superior sensor can do for you. I also decided to buy Olympus' old 50mm f1.4 OM lens. My first fast lens.Fast forward several months, and my demands were beginning to outstrip the equipment I owned. I wanted a fast lens with AF, and a camera body with a sensor that could perform well in low-light. The Panasonic G1 wasn't cutting it, and although the OM lens was a knockout lens, I craved using AF. Enter my 45mm f1.8 & silver E-M5 combo! Although I'm currently lusting for the wider Leica/Panasonic 25mm f1.4, this combination of speed, size, and technology is everything I have been asking for. The E-M5 is small, durable, and has an insane amount of technology packed into its tiny body. Getting such high quality shots, in low-light, on a teeny camera like this, shouldn't be legal! The E-M5 is a beast when you combine it with a quality lens. There's no way else to put it. I've read it elsewhere, and I have to agree: The only way you're going to see a *significant* leap in quality is by going full-frame. But with a full-frame camera comes the associated costs ($3,000+).I couldn't bring myself to get the E-M5 kit. Even if the bundled lens is weather sealed. The fact of the matter is, most of the people picking up this camera aren't your average point-and-shooters. They're people who know a thing or two about photography. And if you know a thing or two about photography, then don't hinder this camera with the kit lens. Attach some quality glass to it, and you'll see it truly shine. The fact of the matter is, the camera is better than the kit lens by leaps and bounds, and will only be held back by it. So, do yourself the favor of getting the 45mm (Olypmus), 12mm (Olympus), 20mm (Panasonic), or 25mm (Panasonic). You won't regret it. And if you really want the benefit of weather sealing, and have the money to blow, go for the new Panasonic H-HS12035 LUMIX G X VARIO 12-35mm/F2.8 ASPH X Series Lens with the constant f2.8 aperture.I don't know what else to tell you. If camera were women, this would be one hell of a bombshell! If it's on your radar, pull the trigger on it. You won't be disappointed.

In hand, the camera is petite, like a scaled down film camera. It immediately felt familiar and comfortable in my hands, as I grew up shooting manual film cameras. Only this time, it didn't weigh me down, though it still feels very solid. The camera is a beautifully engineered little gem. It's gorgeous to look at. I slept with it next to my bed. I'm not kidding. I'm not one for instruction manuals, so I just started playing with it. The settings are mostly intuitive. Even for a person with small hands some of the buttons are small but they are angled so it doesn't feel like I will accidentally hit buttons I don't want to hit. I'm not worried about that being an annoyance. The touch screen monitor is sweet too.The Electronic Viewfinder rocks. It's bright and clear and I can see how it will be really useful. I love it. It's nifty that the monitor screen shuts off when you put your eye up to the viewfinder. So convenient.This camera takes great pics in any light (so far). I bought the Panasonic 20mm 1.7 and love that too. The kit 12-50 looks like it will be useful. It is rather long, but not heavy. I'm looking forward to trying that dust/moisture sealed goodie at Burning Man. I'll probably keep the prime lens away from dust though...I know this is not a very technical review. I'm not a professional, but I do like to be able to control aperture and exposure and ISO from time to time. And have a camera that takes the picture when I push the button. The image stabilization and the lack of noise at high ISO is very impressive.The art filters are kinda groovy. I am guilty of being an Instagram user and some of the effects like \"cross process\" and \"grainy black and white\" looked really nice. I'll try out the \"diorama\" at some point too. While they're not at all essential on a camera like this, it's nice to have some fun too.I am sure I will be using this camera for a long time.

That is a serious piece of professional photography gear that sent me running to dump all of my Nikon DX gear on eBay.

I want to get back to the roots of why this camera even looks like the old pen cameras of the 1970's.  Its about being noticed but not perceived as a threat. See all these new cameras and even DSLR which I own several of have become probes that everyone can see from a mile away. When a person is camera aware you lose the moment and it will never be created again. This camera has given me the ability to walk around and look like a student of photography which gives me the upper hand when getting intimate with my subjects. I want them to think its a film camera and I want them to think the photos will never see the light beyond a darkroom. These all coupled with amazing autofocusing have recharged the belief that this camera is the best on the market. I stand by this 100% and I have been a canon guy for years and even sold my Sony NEX-7 to buy this camera.You will not regret any purchasing such a wonderful camera and I know even if they come out with a new one tomorrow this camera has plenty of years of use in my studio.

Brodsky", "ReviewID": "R1E3BAVCPINKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is my background:  I've owned Nikons up to D800, I've owned most Canons, I currently own Canon 5D Mark 3 with the best Canon lenses - 24-70L II and 70-200L II.  So I am far from the beginner I am used to the best there is.While I love my DSLRs and would not at this point completely abandon DSLRs for many obvious reasons, I've always searched for that 'smaller' cam with the picture quality that would satisfy me.My search led through most m43 and Sony NEX models, Sony RX100, LX3, etc etc etc... I've owned them all and used extensively.  The only one I did not try was Fuji X100 due to problems with AF.... maybe I will one day though.My requirements for small cam are:1) quick AF in any light2) low noise at high ISO3) decent DR range with ability to recover some highlights and shadow4) ability to use an external flash5) comfortable grip6) not flashy7) quiet shutter.8) comfortable viewfinder.9) tilt display is a bonus.I have a 6-month-old at home.  So having a quiet shutter is very important because he is camera shy and loud shutter scares him.  That is why Canon 5D Mark 3 is great with its quiet shutter (truly quiet) and Nikon D800 is not (loud loud shutter, even in quiet shutter mode).in any case, I want to first talk about Sony NEX if you are considering it as an alternative.  In Sony NEX I had Sony NEX 5n and Sony NEX 7.  I also had the best Sony lenses for NEX, including a $1100 24mm 1.8 Sony Zeiss (36mm equivalent).First I had Sony 5n.  With the latest firmware, Sony 5n AF is actually somewhat decent.  The low light quality is very good (same sensor as Nikon D7000, but weaker AA filter which means better picture).  Dynamic Range is great.  You can buy an external viewfinder from Sony (which I dont like even though it has the most pixels).  HOwever, there were not enough buttons to assign the functions that I needed, and the camera was just not very comfortable in my hand.  So I traded up to NEX 7.NEX 7 has better ergonomics.  Enough buttons for me and with its dual dials it is super easy to do everything.  Normal flash shoe so you can use it with a proper flash.  The detail at low ISOs is remarkable - I have some portraits that I've shot with external flash and they are as good as anything I've shot with Full Frame cameras.  So low ISO and still object - amazing quality.The problem with NEX7 though that its AF is actually not as good as even NEX5n.  It would not keep up with my child constant moving - just would not, with the best NEX primes: 24/1.8 and 50/1.8.  Another problem is that NEX7 is noisy at high ISOs, not as good as NEX5n (I agree with Steve Huff here wholeheartedly).  So you have great ergonomics, great low ISO picture detail, amazing dynamic range, a lot of room to crop.  On the other hand you have: lack of lenses (although more lenses have been announced), poor low light quality, and problems with AF.  Also I did not like the placement of viewfinder, I almost never used it because I use left eye to focus.  People that use right eye may find it more comfortable.Enter Olympus OM-D.  my previous m43 cameras were: Olympus EPL1, EPM1, Panasonic GF1, GF2, and G3.  OM-D is the best of the bunch.Here is what I love about OM-D.1)  m43 system is mature with a lot of wonderful lenses, some of which don't cost a fortune (45 1.8 for example is amazing for just over $300).2)  AF is actually VERY FAST in ANY LIGHT.  Let me repeat it, I am happy with AF and it keeps up with my little one most of the time.3)  Pic quality and low light.  Well you have Sony sensor in that one, so the dynamic range is decent now, low light quality is quite decent. In my experience it is somewhere between NEX7 and NEX5n (5n is still better).  But this is better than NEX7.  I use it up to ISO3200 and happy with results (I only shoot RAW).4) ergonomics:  enough buttons and dials for everything plus touch-screen selection of menus if you want, plus even more buttons and dials if you get the Olympus Grip.  Grip makes a lot of difference in comfort.  I did not want to take off the grip once I got it.  Please note there is a $45 third party grip which is now on sale on amazon.  The $45 grip gives you access to the battery door.  However, it obviously does not have buttons unlike the Oly OEM Grip which costs $3005) viefinder - actually very comfortable, the best placement of viewfinder.6) shutter sound - better than on SONYs.I had a black one and now I have the silver.  The silver looks better to me, but the black is more discrete.  If you want to be discrete, better get the black, you will be able to pass it for a point-and-shoot with some smaller primes like Panny 14/2.5.So I am enjoying shooting with OM-D.  Can't wait for its replacement next year, I would not be surprised if they go to a 24MP sensor with even better low light performance!!!!", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pro quality! Sold my pro gear, OMD is that good", "Author": "JaySin", "ReviewID": "R1SX3K0V0YCW6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a pro photographer and have shot Canon since I went digital. Before that thought I shot an OMD film and truly loved not only the quality of the Olympus film camera but the quality of the build and beauty of the design. Since the onset of digital, cameras have been clunky, large and heavy to contain all the necessary buffers and electronics...or...they have been made into small, portabale packages that barely contain any usefulness nor adequate image quality to be of any use to me.Carrying around a DSLR is wonderful as you are prepared to shoot at a pro level. The major downfall is that there really is no truly portable DSLR. To be truly prepared with a DSLR you need your array of lenses, kits and bag; not a portable solution. If going out to shoot and do nothing else one can always pack up the gear and go. BUT many pros and amateurs and snap and shoot photographers want to be able to take good pictures at parties and other events without being burdened with the necessary bulk of a DSLR.I chose my pro DSLR's for their features, image quality and the weather seal features and over the years they were great for dayss when I prepared to carry them around with me or had a shoot. I began bringing my camera with me less and less and eventually my gear never left the house for any family event because I simply got tired of carrying it around. My wife however had a more protable, Canon G11 which is pretty close to a DSLR in terms of function and image quality....I was so envious of the portability of her camera but hated the point and shoot feel and look.I wanted LENSES!!!!!!!So I opted to pick up a PEN hoping a return to Olympus would be as satisfying in digital as it had been before in film. I chose an EPL-1and while I loved the image quality the AF was slow. The lack of an attached EVF killed me as being a pro I longed for a viewfinder. Shooting with a screen at times is ok but for composition, for stability and true use of ones skill I really enjoy a viewfinder. On nearly all MFT camer systems a viewfinder is either an optional accessory or nonexistant.So the EPL-1 went back; I wasn't sure if the camera was the issue or the design but I couldn't live with a camera that wasn't ready to take a picture when I was. I lost too many shots with the EPL-1.The OMD EM-5 solved my problems and more!Fast AF. EVF as part of the camera and not something I have to remember to attach. Image quality that rivals my Canon 5D Mark 2 and has the magnesium alloy body and weather seal of my Canon 7D. Awesome lens selection of quality, fast glass and the focal lengths that cover the necessary range...and of course enough prime lenses to keep me happy.So what did I do? I sold my pro gear. The OMD has actually replaced, quite easily I may add, my 2 pro camers and all of my lenses.There is a saying among photographers about how the best camera for you is the one that is actually with you. The portability of the OMD means I can take it on a shoot, hiking, out to parties and everyday I have it in my messenger bag with me. Being able to have a pro quality, weather sealed camera with me all the time means my skills improve daily. I shoot everyday now.The kit 12-50mm is also a versatile lens but I love my primes as they are fast and the image quality is beautiful. I keep my 45mm 1.8 on the camera and bring the kit lens for when I suspect rain or shooting around water so I have a totally weather sealed setup.And when Olympus claims to be the fastest MFT camera available they are by no means exaagerating. The OMD EM-5 is fast. if it wasn't I wouldn't have purchased it. The bokeh with the pirmes is as smooth and dreamy with a prime lens as on my Canons and in RAW format I couldn't believe that the quality was actually better.As I mentioned before the lens selection for MFT has been something that was lacking in the early days of MFT. The great thing about Olympus is that they are partnered with Panasonic on lens design. So not only are you able to use Oly lenses but Panasonic as well. The lens selection is excellent and I can't imaging anyone not being able to find the speed and focal length they need.Honestly, I won't go back to a DSLR at this point and I definitely will be in line when the next OMD comes out.

I cross-shopped this against the Panasonic G3 and GH2; I recognize that the G3 is much less expensive (I could've almost gotten two bodies for the price of this one body + lens), and the GH2 is more comparable price-wise. When I played around with the G3 in a store, I discovered that I just didn't like how it felt, and I really missed the automatic EVF proximity sensor. I never did get an opportunity to actually hold a GH2, although I imagine I would have liked it a lot. At the end, what tipped the scales for me were:- weatherproofing, since I take my camera on hikes, canoe trips, and mountain bike rides, sometimes under less-than-ideal conditions- in-body image stabilization- capability to add an external battery holder- reportedly greater dynamic range- weatherproof kit lens that goes wider than the Panasonic zooms (12mm-50mm)After having used the OM-D for a few weeks, I can say that I'm happy with the purchase. The IBIS is the real deal, low light/high ISO performance has to be seen to be believed, and the autofocus is wicked fast. The capability and level of sophistication of this camera makes my old G1 look positively primitive. My only real complaint is that I wish the OM-D was a Panasonic, at least from a user interface perspective. I've spent two years shooting with one camera exclusively and I know how to get to all the controls and change all the settings that matter to me without thinking about it. Trying the Olympus for the first time, I knew the learning curve for this camera was going to be a steep one when I discovered that the Olympus zoom works opposite to the Panasonic zooms. I know that the UI on the OM-D is extremely configurable and I've done what I can to match the controls to what I'm used to, but I was only able to go so far. What I miss the most is the fact that the drive mode is not immediately available (on the G1 a lever quickly moves you from single exposure to burst to bracket to timer) and enabling exposure bracketing in particular is buried a couple of menu levels down. I also find it odd that not every button can be assigned to every function. Olympus has seen fit to limit which functions some buttons can take, and to make some buttons not customizable at all (D-pad up and left arrows, in particular). The touch screen menu is pretty comprehensive, but it still doesn't have the bracketing function, and because it's a capacitive screen and can't be operated while wearing gloves, I haven't gotten into the habit of using it. I also miss the fully-articulated LCD of the Panasonic cameras.From an image quality and functionality point of view, the OM-D is exactly what I was looking for.

(OM-D vs. NEX-6)", "Author": "CHoff", "ReviewID": "R1SC3PWHK1C6LM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Me: A 31 year old photo enthusiast. I jumped on board the MFT train back in 2009. I owned a Lumix GF-1 (and briefly a GF-3) prior to this new camera. I started looking for a new camera because I grew tired of relying on flash photography when taking indoor photos of my daughter because all the no-flash pics were blurry despite maximizing aperture on the 14-42 kit lens. I know how to use all the PASM modes and understand the basics of exposure and composition. Basically, I read Understanding Exposure and spent a few years playing around with settings until I was comfortable. I'm by no means a photography fanatic or professional. I'm just a family guy who likes to get good pics of my family and nature.My criteria:MirrorlessCompactTakes quality indoor/low light photos without a flashEase of use (my wife just wants a camera that she can point and shoot)Fast focus to capture the kidsHas a flash when you need itAfter all my research, I narrowed it down to the NEX-6 and the OM-D. Despite all the hype with the OM-D, I went with the NEX-6 because of smaller size, larger sensor, pop up flash and wireless integration.NEX-6:I bought the Sony 16mm f2.8 to use for indoor photos. After getting the camera home and shooting several hundred shots, I was a bit disappointed.Autofocus: The autofocus was hunting frequently. It could usually lock on to a person in the center of the frame, but when I was trying to take a picture of our Christmas tree from 12 feet away, it would just hunt and hunt for a focus. It also couldn't keep up with my daughter resulting in many missed photos.User interface: Relatively easy to use. There is limited customization in buttons and settings. My biggest disappointment in this area is the inability to set auto-ISO limits. I often shot in aperture priority mode and the NEX would frequently crank up the ISO as high as 3200 before slowing the shutter speed resulting in grainy images. The NEX-6 review by pseudorandom parents summed up my frustration pretty well.Video: Great video, no complaints.Flash - Only used a few times, but generally resulted in very harsh photos. I did have great luck pulling the flash back with my finger to bounce it. I'm going to miss that capability. . .Touchscreen - The lack of touchscreen is a huge minus in my book. Once you get used to touching the object you want to focus on with a touchscreen camera, it's tough to go back.Wireless integration - A total publicity stunt. Very slow to connect, not useful. Apps are lame.Kit lens - It's compact. I only took a few shots with it. Performance wasn't great. About what you'd expect from a kit lens.Image stabilization - No in body IS and only a few lenses have it.Phase detect autofocus - This is one of the most heavily touted features of this camera. The problem is it only works with the kit lens right now. That being said, I really didn't notice a huge improvement even with the kit lens.OM-D:I bought the Panasonic Leica Summilux 25mm f1.4 to use with this camera. Keep in mind that all the criticisms of the NEX mentioned above were formulated after I got my hands on the OM-D. When I just had the NEX, I wasn't quite satisfied but I didn't really know why. After reading the amazon review of the NEX-6 by \"pseudorandom parents\" and then using the OM-D, I began to realize why the NEX-6 left wanting more.Autofocus: Just like all the reviews say, it's very fast. The autofocus tracking feature isn't all that reliable, but it actually works pretty good keeping track of my toddler. From what I've read, you need an SLR for good tracking performance.User interface - It's a little more technical than the Sony and you have to download the full manual for explanation of all the options. Even with the full manual, you'll be left confused more than a few times. The dpreview hands on is quite helpful. I'm still making my way through the pages to find all the features available. Suffice it to say that this thing is endlessly customizable.ISO - I know this seems weird, but the ISO performance seems to be better on the OM-D despite the smaller sensor. ISO limits are easily set as well.Video - I did video with the kit lens as well as the 25mm lens and I think that that the video on the Sony was a little better. My first video had a few wobbly frames which according to my research was due to a rolling shutter effect? Anyway, once I put the camera in movie mode (instead of just pushing the record button while in Ap), the effect seemed to go away.Flash - It is a hotshoe mounted flash which is compact but definitely adds bulk to the camera. Like I said above, I'll miss the pop up flash in the NEX and the ability to bounce the pop up flash. With the results I've had thus far, I don't think I'll be needing it very often.Touchscreen - A huge convenience. I love being able to touch to focus and snap a pic in a split second.Kit lens - This kit lens seems to be nicer than most kit lenses. I did a few videos with it and the electronic zoom is quite and smooth.Image stabilization - Since it's in the body, you don't have to worry about the lens IS. It's a really good 5-axis in body stabilizer, just read the reviews online.Digital zoom - you can program the function button to do a quick 2x digital zoom. I love this feature! It allows a convenient zoom feature when using prime lenses. It is a digital zoom so you will lose resolution, but I haven't noticed a huge change.APS-C vs MFT sensor - This was a huge concern of mine and a major reason for initially going with the Sony. I have to say that I haven't noticed any difference in low light, ISO noise, etc. In fact, the OMD seems to be better.Like I mentioned above, my wife just wants a camera that works. One she can pick up and snap good pics without much technical knowledge or tinkering with the settings. I think both cameras work well in this regard. I'm confident that either one will suffice although based on available settings and customization, I do think the OM-D is catered more towards enthusiasts and the NEX-6 more towards the average consumer. I know she will complain about the OM-D flash and the minor inconvenience of attaching it when you need a flash, but it's well worth the inconvenience in my opinion.One more thing. . .the EVF does seem better on the Sony.

After using it for several weeks I have switched completely to m4/3rds and sold off all my dSLR gear and lenses. The reason for the switch is how big and heavy my pack had become with my dSLR. I like to hike and take several lenses with me and the weight had taken all the joy out of capturing that perfect shot for me. I found that I was leaving my gear home more than taking it with me.The E-M5 is SO lite and small. It is no burden to take just about anywhere, especially when coupled with a pancake prime lens. I LOVE IT. Image quality is as good if not even a little better than my D7000 was in many respects. It's not a sports camera by any means, but for just about anything else I have found it to equal what a dSLR can do in a smaller and very smart package. The level of customization is truly amazing. It is not perfect (Buttons are a little small and removable flash is a little clumsy) but all things considered I think it is one of the most well thought cameras in some time. Olympus has hit a home run after being almost left for dead previous to m4/3.I can't give the E-M5 any higher praise than to say I really enjoy using it and take it most everywhere or have it on hand.

A few months with the E-PM1, the Panasonic 20 1.7, an adapter for my old Minolta 50mm manual focus film lens, and a copy of Lightroom 4 and I was hooked.After reading the reviews on the OM-D I started planning my exodus from the world of DSLRs.  I sold my Nikon a week ago and just obtained a retro looking silver OM-D.So is it worth to upgrade to the OM-D?  If you have an E-P3, E-PL3, or E-PM1 and have not yet purchased the VF-2 viewfinder then absolutely.  If you have the VF-2 then I would still say yes, but I would wait till the price drops in a few months time.What you get for your extra hard earned money:- Absolutely awsome image stabilization system.  Better than the VRII system built into my Nikon zoom lens and since it is in-body it works with any lens you attach to the camera.  Also on the OM-D you can set the camera up so the stabilization can be seen when framing just like on the Nikon, Cannon, and Panasonic lens based systems.- Due to the ability to view a stabalized image focusing of legacy zoom and telephoto lenses is greatly impoved. I was able to focus an old Vivitar 70-210mm lens at 210mm (420mm in 35mm equiv.) with no issues.- A very good electronic viewfinder (if you don't already have the VF-2).  The resolution will allow you to manual focus without even engaging the manual focus zoom assist. Integrated design allows external flash with viewfinder.- Better dynamic range with accurate meetering allows the camera to deal much better with highlights (at versus my E-PM1).- Better high ISO performance (ISO 400 and up).- Two control dials- A rear screen that both tilts and is touch sensitive- 16 MP versus 12 MP- 9 FPSWhat you don't get:- Autofocus speed for practical purposes is equivalent (E-PM1 is already at DSLR levels).- Better form factor.  The portability of the PEN series (Particularly the E-PL3 and E-PM1) is hard to beat.- Battery is not backward compatible =(Image quality:Very nice improvement.  In even light with good lenses the PEN image quality is very good and at low ISO (200 to 400) you would be very happy with the OM-D or PEN cameras.  Where the OM-D really shines compared with the PEN cameras is in full daylight or other harsh lighting where better dynamic range and resolution provide a much smoother transistion from hightlight to shadow and a reduction in blown hightlights.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "E-M5 - the Olympus Masterpiece", "Author": "Caver", "ReviewID": "R2DPS1QRKTP6F0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What is with these reviewers who knock the camera because they want a lens hood included or an all-in-one battery charger (without a cord).

I'm not writing a concise point-by-point review, and sure there are issues that some believe MAY be deal breakers for them, but so far I've found absolutely no reason to regret getting this camera. I am a previous owner of an E-P1 and while I did love it and will surely keep it, this camera of course outshines it across the board. The photos I'd been trying to eek out on the E-P1 now come out shining with the E-M5. Will it replace your CaNikon? Maybe. For me, I wanted something easily portable, as most of my better shots are a result of being observant and having my camera actually with me. I carry this camera, 5 lenses and a flash easily in a small camera bag with not much weight. For this reason, it is PERFECT for me. Still, my observations below should be considered as comparisons to my previous E-P1.The IBIS gives me better control in low light, allowing me to get steady shots with lower ISO yielding so much better photos even over the E-P1 (which also has IBIS).The viewfinder is clear and fast... very functional for manual focusing right through the viewfinder.The touch screen is fun, but I still prefer those big dials... and no, they don't tend to get bumped to different settings. I am 6'3\" with long slender fingers, and the camera fits just fine. Some people don't like the placement of the play button for reviewing photos. I don't mind it except when in very dark settings it can be tough to find. My fingers will learn where it's supposed to be so I don't see this being a problem for long.The camera speeds up the focus on my Panasonic 20mm as well as my Olympus 50mm f2.0 macro. The latter searches its entire focal range much less (this was very annoying at times on my E-P1, and while not completely gone this is tremendously improved). I just wish that lens had a range limit switch to prevent this.RC flash control from the included flash to the FL-600R is so much fun to use! The camera works well without flash, but being able to remotely fire that flash is going to be a kick to play with!I'm loving the side placement of the memory card for hot-swapping on a tripod.That's it so far, if I can tear myself away from taking photos I'll come back and add or revise this list accordingly.

I am a professional photographer who was the most diehard fan of all things Nikon. Having been soured by Nikon's quality control issues and several cameras with back focus issues I started looking elsewhere and it has changed everything. As soon as I held the OMD-EM5 with a battery grip in my hand I knew I had something special. So special in fact that I sold every bit of my Nikon equipment so I could build an amazing 4 3 kit. Any of you who are wondering if this camera can compete with the big boys and the so called advantages of the \"full frame systems\" read on. I have shot weddings in dark cathedrals, I have shot commercial events and concerts in every type of venue, I have taken pictures in every type of weather condition and this camera has blown away my expectations. Yes, it may not be quite as fast as other cameras in certain situations but if you prepared you will not be disappointed. I trust that this camera will capture the bride walking down the isle in a dark cathedral or church and the sharpness of the images will surprise any Canon and NIkon devotee. A highly skilled photographer walked past a 24x30 print of mine at the photo lab I use and stopped in his tracks. He said \"that is the sharpest print I have ever seen\" and he was blown away to learn that it came out of the OMD-EM5. I have shot with every level of Nikon camera and never have I ever seen images as sharp as the images coming from the OMD. This camera will make you think differently, differently like when we shot film. It helps bring a level of creativity back to photography that seemed to be replaced by the attitude of so many photographers \"i'll shoot and worry later.\" I get asked \"well don't you miss the dynamic range of the aps-c sensors?\" No, never once have I missed my Nikon cameras. Full frame is a relative term because by definition the 4 3 sensor is a full frame (8x10). Just talked to 2 more photographers at my lab who dumped their Canon and Nikon equipment for the OMD. If you are going to shoot this camera professionally, do so knowing you want to be prepared for the lighting situations and it will leave you breathless. The other reviews have the pros and cons and no its not the perfect camera but in my 13 years in the business I have never enjoyed shooting more with a camera. The OMD is my primary camera and I have the EPL-5 hanging around my neck with a prime lens to match the situation and both cameras in tandem capture the moments perfectly. My carry around every day camera is an EPL-2. These are peoples' weddings and memories I don't dare ruin and I trust these cameras so much to not ruin the memories. Search online to see why so many pros are selling their Nikon and Canon equipment, read the reviews on this camera that show the same. If you know what you are doing for professional shoots and jobs or you just want an amazing street photography camera you won't be disappointed.

Here are my thoughts compared to the cameras I frequently use, which are the GH2 (for video), X-Pro1 and X100.The body is beautiful. However, the ergonomics could be better.I really like the idea of two dials. One for aperture/shutter speed, and the other for exposure/ISO. It's convenient for changing those settings without additional button presses or going into menu. However, the rear dial isn't located at the edge of the camera so it's hard to reach with my thumb. I highly recommend potential buyers to try the camera hands on at shops.The buttons feels spongy rather than tactile. The buttons just above the LCD screen are not easy to reach, or maybe it's just me with my small hands.EVF and LCD are very good. As good as GH2 or even better. They are bright and clear. A twist-type LCD rather than flip-type would be more useful.The autofocus is very fast, as fast as the GH2.The shutter sound is soft, and blends in well to ambient noise. GH2 by comparison is a loud cracker.Image quality is impressive. The default out-of-camera JPEG rendering is beautiful. Dynamic range is also better. If you're the shoot-and-forget type of photographer, this is a great camera for you. Image quality is better than the GH2, but I feel the X100 still has a slight edge and X-Pro1 better. I always feel like I need significant work to bring out the best of the GH2, but not so with E-M5.If you want good image quality, the E-M5 will not disappoint. It is up there with the APSC DLSR cameras, except in a smaller body.The body stabilization works very well, especially for videos. It's particularly useful for longer lens that are more prone to hand shake. The soft humming sound from the image stabilization is noticeable only in a low noise environment. When shooting outdoors, the hum blends into the ambient noise. I didn't notice it was there initially until my friend pointed it out.The Olympus menus is still confusing, even after so many iterations of Micro Four Thirds camera.If you're a GH2 user, it might be worthwhile to upgrade for the extra bit of image quality, depending on the price of E-M5. But the GH2 ergonomics is much better. My dilemma if I can choose today between the two will come down to image quality vs ergonomics/menus.Note that if you use Panasonic lens on this body, it doesn't correct for chromatic aberrations (color fringing) so that would sometimes require additional post-processing.If you're choosing between X100 and E-M5, I recommend E-M5 which is a more versatile all-in-one camera with extensive lens family. Unless you want the Fuji look. I prefer the more subtle Fuji film modes than the Olympus ones.There's no doubt E-M5 will deliver brilliant photos.

High Dynamic Range - its somewhat difficult to blow out highlight details even in high contrast scenes. Out of camera JPEGs are very good at low to medium ISO (with i-Enhance picture mode).- Very effective image stabilization.

While I already own a PEN E-PL2, I really missed having a viewfinder. I was sorely tempted to just buy the VF-2 for the PEN but decided to spring for the OM-D instead. Is is a far superior camera to the PEN (though they are similar in size), my old Sony A300 and I prefer using it over my wife's 5D MK II (just too much to carry around). It is rugged, focuses VERY fast, produces great colors, and renders very nice JPEGs. I wanted something I could have fun with that would be easy to manipulate and experiment with. By far my favorite feature on this camera is the integration between the controls and EVF using the Super Control Panel (which is not turned on by default). With my eye to the viewfinder I can easily call up the Super Control Panel, change virtually ANY setting and see the effects instantly. The two top dials allow me to scroll around the Super Control Menu and change my setting quickly so I can still keep my eye on the shot. All this saves time chimping and setting up shots so I can fire off a salvo of compositions while others are still chimping and screwing around with their settings. I really enjoy the Art Filters as well, mostly the Dramatic and Black and White Grain filters. I'm sure my wife could get the same effects in Photo Shop, but I'd rather just be able to take and share interesting photos right out of the camera and the filters give me the ability to do so. Low light shooting is very good, unlike the E-PL2 and the Touch Screen is a breeze to shoot with. The 12-50 kit lens is also a nice touch. Though it doesn't have the best specs, I find the increased wide and telephoto ends, coupled with the macro setting put it far beyond the old 14-42mm kit lens. I've gotten used to the electronic zoom and find myself using it on electronic over manual for the majority of my shots.The construction is VERY solid. It feels like an old AE-1 Program to me. It LOOKS like an old AE-1 Program to me! I could keep going here, but I'd just be touching on all the points already made by others.The only cons I would say are the price, which is a little high and the shallowness of the viewfinder eye cup.

The only issue I had at first with it was the short bulb timer, prompting me to purchase an EPL-1 as well, simply for the 30 minute bulb(finding out it wasn't compatible with remotes was annoying, but that's neither here nor there.) I enjoyed the size, the quality of the prime lenses, the built in auto-bracketing etc. I also grew to love that the m4/3s allows adapting many excellent older MF lenses very cheaply; my brother has a slimmer budget than me and primarily uses adapted lenses.Still, I found low light, while much better than what I was used to before (unlike many of the reviews here, I came up from unsatisfactory P&S;, not down/sidegrades from DSLRs) sometimes hard to use still, as many of my lenses didn't have OIS. I used a mix of primes and adapted lenses, and very little zooms:Native Primes:Rokinon FE75MFT-B 7.5mm F3.5 UMC Fisheye Lens for Micro Four Thirds (Olympus PEN and Panasonic) - This lens was very nice, my first MF lens, and didn't require much in the way of stabilization.Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras - Loved this lens, works great on all 3 cameras.Panasonic Leica DG Macro-Elmarit 45mm/F2.8 ASPH Lens with MEGA OIS for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras This was a tough decision vs the Olympus one, but I decided I wanted this one for my 45mm focal length and Macro, instead of getting the 45 Oly and the 60 Oly, as I planned to get the next lens anyway:Olympus M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 75mm f1.8 High-Grade Portrait Lens I tested this lens and immediately fell in love. I like the slightly telephoto length, the sharpness, the speed, everything. A bit heavy, but nothing that bothered me (as you'll see in the adapted primes below).Adapted Primes:Minolta Rokkor-X 50mm 1:1.4 manual focus lens This I bought mostly for fun and for the 1.4 speed. I liked the MF and I liked that it was 1.4. It has good image quality, though it has noticeable glow wide open. This can be adjusted post process, of course.Vivitar 200mm 1:3.5 f3.5 manual lens for Nikon SLR This is not quite the lens, but it is close. A 200mm f3.5 for Konica AR mount. It was pretty cheap, and I used it for birding; for me at least, it seemed I could get better shots manual focusing than using the zoom I have below on AF, and the MF of fly by wire ones are pretty slow. Has a similar glow issue wide open.Native Zooms:Panasonic 45-200mm f/4.0-5.6 Lumix G Vario MEGA OIS Zoom Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic and Olympus Micro Four Thirds Cameras This is my only zoom, and it is very good. It has excellent image quality, and fast focus, but I don't use it as much as the manual prime I have above. Dunno why, maybe I'm doing something wrong.Now that I have that unnecessarily large description of my lenses out of the way, note that only 2 of my lenses have built in OIS, the two Panasonic ones excluding the 20mm. I'll make another note here that I purchased the EVF for the GX1, so when shooting between the GX1 and the EPL1, despite the EPL1 having IBIS, it seemed the GX1 was better because I could hold it to my face. The EPL1 may have beat it outside of that, but the GX1 also had better ISO performance, and more features I liked, like HDR.Then I started reading reviews and the like of the OMD-EM5, it's amazing low light performance, it's amazing IBIS, it's amazing noise even at higher ISOs, and wonderful jpegs straight from the camera. On the GX1, I mostly used raws and handled them in Photoshop. So, with a tax refund burning a hole in my pocket, and a new $900 75mm non OIS lens begging to have it's full potential used, I decided to try out the OMD-EM5. I was actually going more for the ISO noise and image quality, I didn't think too much of the IBIS, though it did help.I was shocked at just how good the IBIS once I got it. On the GX1, I could handhold up to 50mm at 1/15 of a second, though easier at 20mm. Still was a bit tricky sometimes, and I preferred using 1/20th+ if possible. The 200 required 1/125 or higher. With the EM5, The effort I use to get 1/15 shots are the same for 1/4 and below, whereas 1/6 and above seem pretty easy, as long as it isn't a moving target. I've gotten clean shots with a bit of practice at 1/1.3 as well, which blew my mind. When using the 200mm, I've gotten clear shots at dusk using 1/15th, which was unthinkable to me. It also helps with my 45, since it's a tad bit slower at 2.8 than some of my other primes.The ISO noise also was very nice, and I found I could take pictures of much darker scenes, simply because with combination of the above, I could use lower ISOs, and those ISOs had better noise control than the GX1. I also find myself using more images straight off the camera, as the quality and colors are better. I'm still sort of in the breaking in phase, but so far I haven't regretted it one bit. I love the built in viewfinder, I often found myself using it on the GX1 all the time anyway.The only down sides I see to upgrading (aside from potentially video, a feature I seldom use) is the portability the GX1 had. I don't like to use flash, but it was nice to have a popup one in case needed, and the size was very nice. Still, those tradeoffs were small compared to everything I gained on the OMD-EM5, which surprised me, as I already loved the GX1. At this point, I think I'm ready to sell or give away the GX1 and use the EPL1 or buy an LX7 if I need a truly portable camera(the LX7 looks to be better in that regard). I think I'm going to stick with Olympus from here on out. I loved the Panasonic, and I loved the design and many things about it.. but this Image Stabilization has me hooked. In Body is the way to go, especially if your system advertises it can adapt almost any lens. </ramble>", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tiny Camera, Huge Image", "Author": "David Dean", "ReviewID": "R2UFFJ13KC5SUT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very impressed with this camera.

Able to use the LCD only for super control panel and image review with the view finder for image taking just like a dSLR, this saves a massive amount of battery life and helps you not look like Uncle Bob or mwac if you're concern about how you are perceived if you always point on the LCD and having it turn on when you pull your face away from the camera- Strange customizations, you will need to tweak multiple combination of settings to allow you to enable just one feature. It can make sense once you learn everything but there's a learning curve.- Very pleased with 3200-4000 ISO with properly exposed images, it's very usable and at first glance in LR I cannot tell a difference between my FX camera which means normal people won't care.- It's not a big deal if I bring my camera anymore. No big bags of gear, no 30lb of glass. You gain about 10point on stealth if this is a video game.- Movie mode is okay, Stabilization works very well but it can't compare to a Gh2, D800 or 5DM2/M3 with the codex and options not good enough for serious usage. When it's finally hacked it will be.Overall I find this is an excellent backup camera if you own a Full Frame camera. If you're using APS-C cameras, I recommend going either FX, this, or both. As for me, I'll use my big camera for work or serious image taking and bringing the tiny em-5 with me everywhere as I'm not really missing anything by leaving the FX at home", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful! A small but crucial step forward for Micro Four Thirds", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R2O0SETVPI5CGT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, a bit of background: this is the 4th (!) Micro Four Thirds camera I have owned. Initially, I purchased the Olympus Pen E-P2 (very near its release date), then the Olympus PEN E-PM1, and finally the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2. For a brief period I owned the Olympus PEN E-P3 as well, but I ultimately exchanged that for the E-PM1.I love the Micro Four Thirds lens lineup, and I have now heavily invested in it, but none of these bodies seemed to quite live up to the promise of the system. I always found myself wanting just a little bit more; in the case of the PENs, the sensor just wasn't quite where I wanted it in low light, and carrying an external flash defeats the entire purpose of such a small camera. The GH2 had a marginally better sensor, but it was also bulky, felt cheap, and the JPEGs were lackluster.All of this, then, led me to the OM-D E-M5.So, the first big selling point of the E-M5: it has the best sensor available for Micro Four Thirds at this time. For the first time in a Micro Four Thirds body, I finally feel like I'm able to boost the ISO as high as I could generally want and get acceptable results (when paired with a fast lens like the Panasonic 25mm f/1.4, that is). Owners of recent APS-C cameras might be surprised at just how close the E-M5 can come to matching the larger format in image quality.Operational speed is even faster than the (already speedy) E-PM1/P3 cameras. It's an incredibly responsive camera. Autofocus is very fast indeed (with the right lens, anyway), with the caveat that AF tracking is still disappointing compared to DSLRs in this price range.Image stabilization is supposedly improved over previous models, but for stills I notice essentially no difference when compared to the E-P2 (the E-M5 does, however, best the rather disappointing stabilization of the E-PM1). In short: it helps occasionally, but don't expect miracles.The \"killer feature\" of the E-M5's stabilization, though, is that it now works for video, which greatly reduces the jittery hand-shake that you've come to expect from home movies. As a video camera the E-M5 lacks many advanced options (framerates, bitrates, etc) which the GH2 possesses (and which serious film makers will demand), but for casual use it's hard to overstate how much the E-M5's stabilization helps.The weather sealing is welcome, although the list of Micro Four Thirds lenses with this feature is quite small. It may be tempting to get the kit with the 12-50mm just to have a weather sealed option, but an extra three hundred bucks for a mediocre kit lens was a bit more than I could swallow just to get the weather sealing. If you're breaking the bank, get the Panasonic LUMIX G X VARIO 12-35mm/F2.8.The construction is overall quite good. This is a sturdy feeling camera, which is something I cannot say about the GH2 with its expanses of cheap feeling plastic. The E-M5 feels solid in hand, much like the E-P3.The camera is the largest Olympus Micro Four Thirds body, but it's still pretty portable, which may not be obvious when looking at photos of the camera. Subtract the EVF hump and you'd be left with something very similar to the E-P3. It's slightly smaller than the GH2 and has a much less prominent grip than that camera.The electronic viewfinder is the same as the Olympus VF-2 add-on for the PEN, more or less, but the camera's processing power and fancy sensor combine to provide an EVF experience that is dramatically better than the GH2 and slightly better than the VF2 on the E-PM1 (the new PENs should reach parity with the E-M5, one assumes). The EVF does feature an automatic eye sensor (unlike the VF-2), a sometimes-useful feature which will often get in your way when using the touchscreen at an angle.The capacitive OLED touchscreen is similar to that of the E-P3, except it articulates to provide up to a 45 degree tilt downward, and up to a 90 degree tilt upward. It's pretty darn nice. The screen is substantially brighter and clearer than the E-PM1 or GH2, and the touch responsiveness is much better than the GH2's mushy resistive affair. Truth told, I much prefer this to using the EVF in most scenarios.The physical layout and control points represent a moderate departure from the PEN series. Instead of a weird little D-Pad combo dial and (on some models) a thumb dial, the E-M5 gives you two dedicated dials on the top of the camera: one for thumb and one for index finger. I quite like this, actually; adjusting EV compensation in A or S is a breeze, and M mode is fast and painless. One never needs to use the touchscreen to control anything on the E-M5; it can all be done with physical buttons and those dials. I appreciate the FN2 button and (reprogrammable, thankfully!) REC button on the top of the camera, and the D-Pad and surrounding controls are easy enough to operate (though, as some say, they are smallish and a little squishy due to the weather sealing), but the FN1 and Play buttons are a bit inconvenient for me to hit since the screen juts out in front of them. I do love the rubberized rear thumb grip, which lends itself to comfortable one-handed shooting with small lenses, and the front grip is more than adequate for me (indeed, the E-PM1 had none at all). The power switch is a little difficult to flip, which in practice means I often leave the camera on and simply let it go to sleep.The software UI is basically lifted straight from the PEN series. Olympus's menu system is extensively customizable, and while it can seem overwhelming initially I'd rather have all of the options than not. A favorite mode of mine is the \"SCP\" AKA \"Super Control Panel\" which allows for ready access to settings.The flash is a ridiculous, non-bouncing clip-on affair, like the E-PM1/PL3. The camera looks almost comical with the flash mounted. Annoyingly, to use the clip-in flash, you must remove a little piece of plastic on the AP2 port (and you had better keep that little plastic handy for when you remove the flash, since the weather sealing relies upon its presence). The clip-in flash's most notable capability is as a wireless trigger for compatible Olympus flashes, otherwise you might want to just leave the silly thing at home.To break it down:Plusses:+ Weather sealing+ Much improved sensor+ Exceptional operational speed+ Optional grips (for those who like them)+ Great lens selection (excepting the lack of weather sealed options)+ Exceptional single-shot AF performance+ Great JPEG engine+ Tilting capacitive OLED screen+ In-body image stabilization in video modeNeutral:= Built-in EVF which adds bulk (I prefer detachable)= Unintuitive but powerful menu system= Many customizable control points, but some are small-ish and \"mushy\" due to weather sealingMinuses:- Annoying little clip-in flash- Limited weather sealed lens selection- Expensive compared to comparable APS-C DSLRs- New battery not compatible with PENs- Poor continuous AF performanceThe E-M5 is not a huge step forward for Olympus, but it is a decisive effort to provide something more \"serious\" than the PEN series. In many ways, the E-M5 is \"just\" a souped up PEN with weather sealing, a new sensor, and a built-in EVF - but those are things that many people will be looking for in a camera, especially if they are switching from a DSLR. This camera is an all around great effort, the best Micro Four Thirds camera to date, and its only substantial weakness is in the price (which represents a premium over comparable DSLRs, which it will surely be compared against).", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Thought on the Olympus OM-D E-M-5", "Author": "Nermal", "ReviewID": "R3FMLGQX9JTEPW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not going to reiterate what has been said so many times already about this camera, except that is a great photographic tool. My motivation for purchasing the Olympus OM-D is to downsize.  I currently also own a Nikon D300 with assorted lenses and accessories and found the last few years, on many occasions, I've been leaving it at home in favor of my compact \"point and shoot\" camera, which is currently an Olympus XZ-1.  Although the XZ-1 is a great camera, it does not offer the flexibility and image file quality of the larger shooters.  After much soul searching and reading of reviews I settled on the M4/3 system and Olympus to be the best fit for what I wanted to achieve.  I am NOT disappointed with my choice.Some random thoughts:1).  Definitely a small camera which took some getting used to, but now that I've used it for a while the camera works well with my shooting style.  And it is much more pleasurable to carry around all day and is more discrete than the Nikon D300.2).  Because the camera is so small the buttons, as many before have said, are likewise quite small.  I don't know if there is any solution for that, but after using the camera for a while their use becomes second nature.  Also, there has been much said about the \"mushy\" feel of the buttons.  I don't understand that criticism. They seem just fine to me.3).  Image quality is incredible.  So far I've been shooting auto ISO up to ISO 1600 (RAW+JPEG) with extremely good results with little post processing required in most images.4).  When I read other reviews regarding the separate flash it didn't bother me too much as I intend to do mostly available light work and use the flash for occasional fill.  What all those reviews did not mention is that to attach the flash to the camera requires removing three tiny pieces of plastic (one from the flash and two from the camera).  C'mon Olympus, fix that.5).  The Kit Lens: The new 12-50mm kit lens gets mixed reviews online.  That's the one I bought with the camera and, while not great, it's still pretty darn good!  The macro, for a kit zoom lens, is a real bonus and I think works very well.  Much has been written about how slow the lens is at the long end.  While it certainly would be nice if this lens was f5.6 instead of f6.3 at 50mm, consider this:  All other M4/3 kit lenses are 3X zoom ending with f5.6 maximum aperture at the long end.  The Olympus zoom is a 4X zoom.  With the lens on the camera I zoomed in to 36mm, which would be a 3X zoom, and the maximum aperture available read f5.6 on the camera.  So, at 3X zoom the available maximum aperture appears to be no different than any of the other kit lenses plus you get the added zoom range, albeit at a dimmer F6.3.  Oh, and when you look at pictures of the lens on the camera, it looks longish and large.  Yes, it is a bit on the long side, but it is still quite small and lightweight.6).  The camera name: OM-D E-M5.  Really?  Enough said.7).  I'd give 5 stars if it weren't for the awkward flash arrangement.So bottom line:  I will likely sell all the Nikon stuff and stick with the M4/3 gear.  I've also purchased the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens.

M Ullman \"chimayred\"", "ReviewID": "RCUUS16MVPR4C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "well, i am a 57 year old \"enthusiast\" and basically I take travel pictures; i try to be creative, don't use Photoshop but I do use NIK HDR EFEX pro software once in a  while and I take a good basic snapshot.  I love color, sharpness, memories.  I have had a dozen cameras from old 35mm Canon ftbn to Nikon D-40, a slew of Fujifilm P & S (including an F30 which was AMAZING), a canon G10, canon S-95 the original Sony Mavica (which wrote to a floppy!), a Tosbiba, a Lumix superzoom, and an Olympus EPL-1.  I use the Olympus for travel.  I like it because it is WAY smaller than the Nikon D40, actually the body is smaller than the G-10; it uses a manual zoom lens (which of course is auto focus, but it doesn't rely on battery power to zoom); i have the Oly 14-150 micro four thirds zoom lens.  It is a great, compact package.  I think it is ergonomically great.  So what are the problems with the EPL-1 that made me buy an OM-d EM-5 (and incidentally, I bought it at my local photo shop and it took me 3 days to get it; one of the largest most reputable camera stores in NYC just told me 2 days ago it would take 2-3 MONTHS!)  And I got it at the same price.So.  The EPL-1 LCD monitor in bright sunlight is very challenging.  There is no viewfinder unless you want to pay an additional $170-250.  Low light performance wasn't the best. The upside?  Ergonomics, small package and Wow!  the pictures.  Even though I had a hard time seeing the image on the monitor lcd, when I got home the pictures were universally terrifically exposed.So the OM-d has Iso to 25,600.  No flash, but with that Iso and the reviews about noise it sounds like I won't miss flash.  I took a few pictures in near total darkness at 25,600 and they were surprisingly good.  More art filters, which I like.  Art filter bracketing, which I like (you take one shot, you get I think 10-11 art filters).  More options,  Highly configurable.  I think the electronic viewfinder works well.  Ergonomics?  I don't know where some of these people are coming from....I am 6', 225 pounds.  I find the buttons just fine, thanks.  Nice solid feel.  Weight is great.  I put the 14-150 on it; it is nearly the same size as teh EPL-1, a few mm wider and taller.  Heavier and more solid, but I think the thumb grip is an improvement as there is no nearby button to accidentally hit and the front grip is just fine, thanks again.  I use a custom made wrist strap and it feels great.  Slightly heavier than the epl-1.  (and btw, with the new 14-42 lens that I took off the om-d and put on the EPL-1, the epl-1 is smaller than my G10 and will become my \"in my car for any contingency\" camera.  What a deal....Initially going through the basic manual and CD it seems easier to use than I thought.  Perhaps that is because I am familiar with most of the Olympus menus.  Yes, the super control panel was a little hard to find and I am still feeling my way around some of the idiosyncrasies (like when I take a pic with the EVF there's no preview on the monitor, or at least not yet!).  Navigation is a little more dependent on menus and the control panel, although I haven't assigned any buttons yet.  I really like the super control panel and it is very easy to use.  I think the whole thing is more intuitive than the EPL-1 was.  How does it compare to Nikon or Sony?  Don't know.  All I know is that the images are lights out on the old camera, and i will update this review when I have shot a few hundred shots.  But from the viewpoint of construction, initial usability, ergonomics, looks, feel, menus, navigation, it is everything I have read and more.  And I suspect the images won't be too shabby either.  I like the idea of an all in one camera, and with the 14-150 lens on it (which has never come off my EPL-1 from the day I bought it) photography is a blast.  No switching lenses, no additional costs, no dust issues, no storage and weight.  One camera, one lens.  Yahoo!  Purple fringing?  Barrel distortion?  Come on.  The pictures are gorgeous.SO:  I have had the EM-5 for a few months.  Let me get to the con's first:First the battery life isn't great.  With the fully charged Olympus battery and a pretty aggressive setting for power saving I could get 200 pics during daylight; i'm sure it would be much worse with flash.  With off brand batteries - 100 pics.  As long as I have spares I am not upset about this but it is something you should know if you buy this as a first timer and don't usually get spares.  Buy a few. It makes me wonder why there isn't an option to charge batteries in AND out of camera.Second, just a little confusing about how to toggle between viewfinder and monitor.Pros:  Now that I have shot over 1000 pics I can say the pics with the Olympus 14-150 lens are spectacular.  Low light is terrific - and that is something that was lacking in every camera I have owned since the Fuji F30, including a nikon d40, EPL-1, and Canon G10.  I shot indoors pics at a party in a function hall and they were great.  If i had figured out a head that they'd be that good I would have been able to adjust white balance and it would have been even better.Focusing speed, lightning fast.  I love the tele converter function and have it programmed in the Fn 1 button.  It gives me the equivalent of a 600mm lens with a push of a button, and I also have manual focus as Fn 2 with magnification assist so if I need to manually focus I can.  Panorama function works well, a little confusing c/w Canon but very easy to process.  Art filters, scenery, ergonomics are amazing.  Whereever I go, people ask about it.  I was in a store in Carmel CA and a guy was looking at small mirrorless cameras and I think I sold him on this.  A pleasure to carry.  I like the weather resistance and only wish my 14-150 lens had it.  Menus aren't as confusing as some people say; what is confusing is that this is incredibly versatile.

This camera has  so many ways to configure. You can even configure the direction of lens focus.2. So expect to spend sometime to experiment and figure out the right configuration as it is complicated. But once you found your favorite mode and save it, it is very easy to use and for some reason, I actually feel it is such a sweet camera.3. It is really small and a little bit light weight.4. Color is very good even in the jpeg file. So far I'm still shooting dual mode (jpg + raw) as I'm still observing. But the jpeg files look very good, similar to the ones I can get from Lightroom with the raw files. I may end up dropping raw once I can trust the jpeg engine.B. Cons1. Small is not always good. It may make smaller buttons hard to find/press. Many people set function fn1 button to do AF.  It is hard to press and very close to other buttons.2. The AF is far and away from Nikon DSLR regardless whatever Olympus claims to be. AF is very fast when you are shooting static subjects. But if you use it to shoot a moving subject, you will cry out for Nikon ( or Canon). I just came back from Death Valley. The E-M5 shoot fine until we saw a coyote. I took a few shots then the coyote started \"walking\". And the E-M5 has a very hard time to keep up focusing and I kept losing views in the view finder. So forget about BIF (bird-in-fly), this camera can not even handle a walking coyote easily.3. The Olympus lenses are too expensive to me in general.[Updated 2014/1/8]I now learned that I can turn image review off so I can see the subject after release the shutter. So I no longer lose view of the subject while taking photos.I felt this camera fills the gap between P&S; and DSLR like Nikon D7100. When the light is good, the IQ is like DSLR. But when the light is not so good, that's the time I wish I brought my D7100 with me. The low light performance is not as good as D7100.

Maynard", "ReviewID": "R3OLGEZ5A6N3EW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my first OMD as a kit, with the 12-50 Zuiko lens and immediately became convinced of two things. First, the camera, itself, was a new wonder, which elevated the 4/3rd's format to a real prosumer semi professional level. Second, the kit lens it came with did not do justice to the camera, being too slow to allow the low light performance that this camera is truly capable of, For this reason, I soon discarded this lens in favor of several single focal length primes by both Olympus and Panasonic and the wonderful 7-14 and 12-35 Panasonic Lumix multi focals. Anyone interested in using this camera as a light weight semi professional instrument to handle the vast majority of serious photographic needs should purchase it as a body only and then add the desired additional lens (es).The new 16 mp sensor is really impressive. It captures great detail and allows 10 X crops when used with incredibly sharp lenses like the 25mm Leica-Panasonic f1.4 summilux. It's high ISO capture qualities with impressively low noise allows ISO use as high as 6400 without significant loss of detail. In camera image stabilization is a wonder. I was able to hand hold the 40-150 small, light weight Zuiko lens at it's 300mm full frame equivalent length at 125th of a second and get sharp results, something I can never do with the 70-200 Canon lens on my 5D Mk 3. This allow great use of light weight Zuiko lenses without the heaviness of built in lens image stabilization. And speaking of the Canon 5 D and lenses, they are heavy to carry around all day, while the OMD with several lenses are light and easy to carry.The camera alone has excellent ergonomics when used with such small light weight lenses as the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 and the 45mm f1.8 Zuiko.  However, the 25mm Leica Panasonic lens begins to over balance the camera and this problem is really accentuated with the 12-35, 7-14mm Panasonic's and the 75mm Zuiko lenses. For this reason, and in order to use these excellent lenses, I believe that the ergonomic improvement given by the accessory hand grip is essential. This is an expensive 2 piece product, for which I use the single piece without the battery pack almost exclusively. It is well worth the price for the additional flexibility in lens use it gives.Since I am used to SLR mirror cameras, I have always felt that EVF system cameras have been difficult to use in bright light, The OMD's EVF is actually quite easy to use in bright light, particularly if the extended accessory rubber eye piece is added. It costs less than $20 and facilitates ease of use, particularly to those who compose using eye glasses.The camera provides great flexibility in available controls, with 2 function buttons and 2 dials. This allows me to control ISO and metering area in either shutter or aperture modes, giving the same sense of personal control that I have with my Canon 5D Mk III. In sum I give this camera an excellent rating. I am now using it for most of my shooting needs. By the way, the 40-150 Zuiko is a wonder, even if poorly built. It is low cost, sharp, but more importantly, I can carry around a 300mm full frame equivalent lens in my pocket: not possible with the 70-200 Canon lens.

Since then I have owned several other cameras including an Evolt E-500. Recently I decided to explore street and nature photography, and I had a hard time investigating for the most appropiate equipment for these tasks considering volume, weight, camera building quality, image quality and budget. Finally I sold my old Nikon equipment and decided to adquire an EM5.I was afraid of the learning curve which normally takes weeks and even months of returning to the manuals seeking for a hidden feature or a way to change something. The first thing that I like on the E-M5 is that I'm using the camera as if I had it for years. The body has just the buttons for the really needed functions, and the organization of the menus is natural. I have only read the manual once in a very fast overview. The only thing that I couldn't  realize for myself was where the USB cable connector was.I only shoot in RAW, so I even don't care about the settings for processing the image in camera. Most of the time I shoot in manual mode. So, after charging the battery for three hours or so, I selected RAW as my image quality, ON for Image Stabilization and that was all I needed to go out and capture a sunset.In the night I went to a birthday celebration which I photographed using ISO 1000, and bounced flash in manual mode.I didn't have to make the chromatic aberration correction that I was used to do with the pictures taken with another camera. The sunset pictures taken at ISO 200 are clear and noise free, even when I exposed for the highlights and then used PS to recover enough detail from the dense shadows. No luminosity noise that I can see. No color noise. And I found a surprising ORF format able to recover lots of detail.And for the birthday pictures, taken at ISO 1000, with the ambient light subexposed one and a half stops, I had to see the image at 100% in order to appreciate the grain. So fine it is. No color blotches at all. It's a very fine grain that looks like the grain from the old film days. I even didn't try to deal with it. The pictures are clear and full of detail like the hair and eyebrows.Face detection is very good. It has three levels for this feature. can make a general face detection, or focus on the eye closest to the camera, or on the left or right eye.But my favourite feature is the image stabilization system. Within reason, now I can take pictures hand held in situations where I needed a tripod before. Before an automatic IS mode, the camera has vertical and horizontal antishake modes.For the camera, is light, but doesn't feel like a toy. It sits firmly on the hand. Having no mirror, it has a very silent operation. There's only a small vibration that I have read it's due to the image stabilization system.The viewfinder is clear and luminous. It's able to detect that the eye is approaching, and then shuts off the rear screen. If I'd prefer to view the scene on the screen, I only had to press one button in the right side of the viewfinder. The screen can be arranged so one can take pictures over the head, or at waist level, having full control of the composition.One big surprise to me is that the camera is able to render the DOF and luminosity of the scene while one is composing the picture. So no more guessing shots to me.The camera is full compatible with my old FL-50, FL-50R and FL-36R flashes.Several months later...I'm editing this post to note that the camera works fine with 4/3 lenses such as the 18-45 and 45-150 kit lenses that came with the E-500. It is done by using a ring adapter. This device makes possible the electronic communication between the body and the lens, preserving features like IS, AF, focus target, metering and face recognition. AF is very slow though, and it only works in S-AF mode.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "What an incredible camera - sold my Nikon gear after getting it", "Author": "J. Austin", "ReviewID": "R3NSARAFH8FGVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read numerous reviews about the OM-D E-M5 before making the purchase (from another vendor as Amazon now charges sales tax to CA residents). It has far exceeded my expectations. Beautiful to look at (I went with the silver) with its retro styling, very comfortable to hold, and and an incredible amount of customization. The IBIS is as good as people say, and the pictures are stunning especially when used with good glass. The kit lenses (14-42, 12-50) are ok, but you won't get the benefit of the great sensor with them. I'm using my OM-D with the Pany 25/1.4, Oly 45/1.8 and Oly 60/2.8 macro and am amazed at my results. And if you are on a budget, definitely take a look at the Sigma 19/2.8 and 30/2.8 being sold together for an unbelievable package price from the famous NY dealers. Both of them have excellent image quality and for 2 bills for the pair of lenses, you can't beat the price for 2 high quality primes. I just ordered the combo package as well though I will likely use the previously mentioned 3 on my OM-D and the 2 Sigmas on my Pen E-PL2 bodies (1 visible and 1 IR).And yes, after getting the OM-D, I realized I didn't want to lug around my heavy arsenal of Nikon bodies (D300, D7000) and lenses any longer. The image quality from the OM-D with the primes listed above far exceeds what I ever got from my Nikon setup so I had no hesitation in selling it all. And with my new setup being so small and light, I find I am much more likely to take it with me. The OM-D and Pany/Oly prime lenses have renewed my interest in photography and I am enjoying every minute.Note: The resolution, noise levels, and dynamic range of the OM-D are very comparable to the newest high end Nikon crop sensor bodies. It still doesn't compare to Nikon Full Frame bodies, obviously the sensor size does limit that, but given the cost of a FF body and FF (FX) lenses, not to mention the weight, I think 90% of photographers would be fine with this set-up.I hope this is helpful.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Camera I've ever had.

Sinclair", "ReviewID": "R25C7FEJO90RLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Nikon (APS-C) owner for several years - D40x, D80, and D90 - using mostly mid-grade Nikon lenses.  I loved the Nikon gear and wasn't really looking change systems, but I really didn't like the physical bulk of the equipment.  Hiking and camping are two of my pastimes so smaller, lighter gear has long been on my wish list.Enter the OM-D.  Based on the size, specs and early reviews I decided to take a chance, sold my Nikon kit and bought a Silver OM-D with the 12-50mm kit lens.--- Size, Build, Ergonomics ---This thing is small!  Transitioning from a mid-size DSLR to the (relatively) tiny OM-D was startling.  In the hand, it feels very solidly built but the front grip is disappointingly small and flat and would be inadequate were it not for the perfectly positioned thumb rest the back.  The OM-D is not nearly as secure during one-handed operation as my Nikon D90 was and many other reviewers have noted that the optional Olympus Battery Grip vastly improves the situation, but at the cost of size/weight.  I can't comment on the optional grip as I do not own it.The buttons and dials are a mixed bag.  The twin rotating control dials are well positioned and easy to manipulate and can be customized to your preferred shooting style.  The Playback and Fn1 buttons, positioned near the top right corner of the back panel, are not designed well.  While they are easy to locate by feel, they are mushy with little discernable feedback and positioned above the thumb rest in such a way that makes them awkward to use.  The four-way directional buttons are similarly mushy and slightly too close together in my opinion, but are positioned better that the Playback and Fn1 buttons.  Anyone with large hands or wearing gloves may have a hard time operating the back-panel buttons.While the EVF (Electronic View Finder) has generally been highly praised by the Media, I miss the optical view finder from the D90.  For me, the act of composing an image is a somewhat intimate affair and the EVF, while clear and informative, is too obviously `electronic' and misses an essential piece that helps make photography so enjoyable.  I am getting more used to the EVF, but personally I prefer a good OVF to an EVF.  That being said, the EVF can be very useful.  In moderate to bright light, the EVF is clear and detailed, refreshes quickly enough, and can be customized to display pretty much any information you could want.  My favorite is the ability to show clipped highlights and/or shadows real time in Photoshop style.  In low-light, however, the EVF is near useless.  What would be easily viewable through an OVF is a black featureless mass through the EVF.  The real downside of this being that accurate focus is nearly impossible without trial and error - especially true considering that most M4/3 lenses have no distance markings.Live-view is a feature that the mirrorless ILCs inherited from the compact camera (also mirrorless, but then they always were).  My old D90 had live-view as well, but it was clunky and noisy having to manipulate the mirror with each use, not to mention that live view focusing was dismally slow.  Using live-view on the articulating LCD of the OM-D feels natural and I find myself composing images using live-view most of the time now.  This is especially true when taking pictures near ground-level or overhead.  I'm certain I've missed or not even considered some compositions using the D90 simply because using the OVF was too difficult or impossible.The Battery and SD card slot doors can be opened while on a tripod.  A good thing considering the relatively short battery life.--- Features---Virtually all of the OM-Ds controls are customizable with many options.  I've owned the camera for months and am still trying new configurations.  If you have a favored set of manual functions, chances are that you can set up the OM-D to perform them to your liking.  Likewise, there are several methods to change often used menu settings using the LCD or EVF.  Currently, I am using each of the four-way dial buttons for quick access to my most heavily used settings.Coming from the D90, all of the features I used are present, with quite a few new options. My favorite new feature is called `Live Time'.  Live Time is similar to bulb, except that the LCD can be configured to display a live, periodically updated view of the photo while it is in the process of being captured.  For long exposures, this is unbelievably useful and saves you from lots of trial and error.  I've also found that it facilitates the compositional element of time that was much more difficult without it.  Fun stuff!A lot has been written about the 5-Axis In-Body-Image-Stabilization (IBIS).  I won't go into detail except to say that it works at least as well as the Nikon lens-based VR systems with the added benefit that it also works for virtually any lens attached.Bracketing on the OM-D is limited to 1 EV step maximum, which I find limiting considering the very wide DR of the sensor.  I would love to have that bumped up to 2 or 3 EV steps.  As it stands, I have been manually dialing in larger exposure compensation values to get the bracketing I desire.The OM-D also offers various `ART' scene modes which may or may not be useful to you, but can be interesting from time to time.  Note:  `Bracketing' is possible with ART modes by way of saving a copy of the image with each ART mode applied.  This can take a considerable amount of time.Digital sensors all develop `hot' pixels over time and the OM-D is no exception.  The OM-D has a built-in pixel mapping feature that locates and effectively `maps-out' the failed pixels.  Much easier and faster than dealing with the issue in post processing.Another neat feature is the ability to use magnified live view during manual focus.  This can be implemented in a number of ways, but serves to make MF useful in many situations.--- AF, Metering---AF is quick and accurate on all of the lenses I've had the opportunity to try with 35 focus points available that cover most of the image area.  It is possible to make the AF more accurate while using magnified live-view as well.Metering is generally very accurate and does a good job minimizing blown highlights.  Metering can be customized in the typical fashion and also using Olympus' own `high-key' and `low-key' settings.One problematic area - at least for me - is metering with flash.  I have found it to be alarmingly inconsistent, at least compared to the D90 with flash.  It may just be me and/or the settings I have chosen, but given the good results from the D90, it might be the camera.  Shots are randomly over- under- or correctly exposed.  I have not spent a lot of time trying to  determine the cause, but suffice to say your mileage may vary.--- Image Quality ---I'm extremely happy with this 16.2 MP Sony-sourced sensor.  High dynamic range, extremely low noise at most ISO settings up through 6400 or so, depending on the image and light levels.  Above 6400, and noise jumps up, and color saturation and DR drops.  I've found that ultra-high ISO when combined with black & white and/or an ART mode can result in an acceptable photo from time to time.The DR is great enough to render the Bracketing feature mostly useless (as I wrote about earlier).  Shooting RAW at low ISO generally captures all of the detail and color in a scene and can produce amazing results with a little post-processing.  In-camera JPGs are the best I've seen (with Sharpening set to \"-1\").  Under normal shooting conditions, you'd be hard pressed to process a RAW file that looks better than the camera's JPG.One nit to pick is the low ISO limit of 200 which necessitates the use of an ND filter to allow for slow shutter speeds.  Not the huge problem, but occasionally inconvenient.--- Movie Mode ---The OM-D shoots video in resolutions up to 1920 x 1080 (60i from 30p output).  I don't shoot much video, but I will say that the IBIS works amazingly well for video, greatly reducing the hand-held `jittery' effect that my video clips typically show. I would also recommend caution using continuous AF for video as it tends to hunt when recording moving subjects, and is unnecessary for static subjects.--- Lens selection and availability ---The M4/3 system has a large number of available lenses that seems to be growing daily.  Lens quality is generally very good with a few standouts (good and bad). I recommend doing your own research to determine which lens(es) are right for you. My biggest gripe has nothing to do with lens quality and that is:  Used lenses are very hard to come by.  Most of my Nikon gear was purchased via Craigslist making my entire kit relatively inexpensive.  So far, all of my M4/3 gear has been purchased new - out of necessity, not choice.  This may or may not matter to you, but be aware.  Of course this will rectify itself over time, but for now, most lenses are only available from retailers.--- Summary ---Pros:  Size, feature set, image qualityCons:  Grip / Button ergonomics, Low light focusing using EVF, flash metering (maybe)", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "There is no perfect camera, but this is very good", "Author": "Harry M. Shin", "ReviewID": "R2U9JWCUQL969V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1.  Some boring background info:  I've used many film cameras (Contax, Hassy, Nikon etc...) and then digital (Sony R1, Sony A850, Pentax K5, Olympus E-P1/ P3 and E-5 with 12-60mm, 50-200mm, 50mm macro etc...)2.  I've been using the E-M5 for the past several months and basically have a definite positive impression of this camera.  Here are my bottomline impressions:  a:  Ergonomics: It looks like a bigger camera compared to the E-P3 but it's really not.  You definitely have to check it out in the store.  Likewise, those who didn't like the ergonomics of the E-P cameras are not going to really like the E-M5 either.  It's a little better but not by much;  I should clarify, the grip is not better.  Furthermore, if you like to use the standard 4/3 lens, then the existing grip is really substandard.  However, there is very good news, the HLD-6 (I think that's what it's called) is an awesome product and is a 1000% must buy for all E-M5 users who are going to use the standard 4/3 lens and I would say most \"traditional\" type photographers who are going to use the E-M5 even with the smaller m4/3 lens.  The HLD-6 grip just markedly improves the grip / ergonomics of this camera.  Thus, with the HLD-6, the ergonomics of the E-M5 is excellent.  The other huge leap forward in regards to the ergonomics is that the E-M5 has two dials on the top right of the camera;  a huge huge improvement over the E-P cameras.  Furthermore, because of this reality, you won't be accidently changing exposure or other settings while taking shots (hard to explain but I was always doing this with the E-P cameras and it drove me nuts;  I tend to shoot in manual exposure most of the time and thus this was a problem).  Thus in re: ergonomics, the E-M5 is a huge improvement and this alone would be reason (at least for me) to get this camera.  c:  Quality of build:  as always, good stuff via Olympus.  d:  Features:  I'm digging into the nuts / bolts, but as always, good stuff via Olympus.  I must say that it is nice to have the markedly improved burst rate and the buffer;  big improvements compared to the E-P cameras.  The one feature that I really wanted but isn't present is the lack of fully moveable LCD (ie like the E-5).  For most folks this may not be an important feature but I use the fully moveable LCD on the E-5 quite a bit; it literally improves the \"flexibility\" of the camera, esp for special applications like panoramic photography etc...  In terms of focusing, no problems with m4/3 lens.  However, despite what a lot of people are stating out there on the internet, the autofocus is terrible when using standard 4/3 lens.  It's doable, but it's slow enough that I always shoot manual focus when using my standard 4/3 lens.  It's not a big deal with my type of photography (ie landscape), but can be a serious issue for those doing quick type photography with the standard 4/3 lens.  e:  Imaging Quality:  I'm going to be an outlier here by saying that the imaging quality is excellent... but then so was / is the imaging quality of the prior pen cameras, E-5 etc... etc...  If you're shooting standard scenes / situations / non super high ISO situations, you should be able to get excellent shots with basically any camera and if you're not... well, that's another story for another day.  With that being said, the E-M5 produces potentially great images, I shoot exclusively in RAW and I'm happy with the images I get.  But in terms of it being some quantum leap from the prior pen cameras or the E-5;  not really, but again, those prior camera were / still are great cameras for producing excellent images.  f:  EVF:  Even as a traditionally educated photographer, I don't know why people make such a big deal as to whether or not a relatively compact camera has a built in EVF.  With that being said, this is the first Olympus m43 camera with a built in EVF and... it's ok.  When using such cameras, I tend to use the LCD to shoot anyway and thus don't gravitate to the EVF in the first place.  However, when using the EVF, it's ok, but nothing more.  The reason I say that is because when compared to the external Olympus EVF (VF-2), the VF-2 is overtly much better.  It's brighter, it has more contrast, is basically more clear.  Yes, I do have the VF-2 and the difference is subtle but at the same time noticable.  Thus, when doing stuff like macro where I'm going to want to view the image via the viewfinder, I always put on the VF-2.  For routine shooting, the built in EVF (or LCD) works good enough.  By the way, to state the obvious, the EVF in no way replaces or compares to the E-5 OVF.  It's a no brainer, but again, there are folks stating otherwise...2.  Brief note re: 12-50mm.  It's small... compared to the standard 4/3 12-60mm, yea it's small.  But compared to the m4/3 14-48mm (I think that's the focal length), it's obviously bigger.  It's all a matter of reference.  The bottomline is that it's a nice lens, nice feel, but it is no where in the same league as the 12-60mm.  I'm not saying that there are those who are trying to put it into that same league, but because of the focal length, it's going to be compared.  The 12-50mm is definitely of a cheaper feel (plastic, lightweight etc...), but for a kit lens, I would say this is the best kit lens I've ever purchased.  Excellent imaging capability, excellent focal length range;  very versatile.3.  In summary:  There is no perfect camera.  If you are a prior pen owner or Olympus DSL owner wondering if it's worth checking out the m4/3 scene, I would say that this is almost a 99% no brainer because of the marked improvement over the Pen cameras as well as the pragmatic ability to use the E-M5 with standard 4/3 lens (it is not an E-5 replacement, but it'll add flexibility to your system).

The image stabilization is amazing - I have taken handheld pictures at 1 sec shutter speed with no blurring! The waterproofing is very important to me and is a huge bonus. It is somewhat heavy compared to other similar cameras - the body weighs twice that of the pen mini, the sony nex-5 or the panasonic gx-1 or gf-3 (but none of these has the built-in viewfinder and the weathersealing of the om-d), but is still lighter and more compact than any D-SLR. Other minor downsides are an occasional struggle to focus (if this happens, you can simply focus manually), and the fairly high price. Also, the manual gives limited information and it is a bit of a learning curve to learn the complexities of the camera (however, you can start by shooting in the i-auto mode, which seems to do the right thing much of the time, especially when shooting people, since it tends to like large apertures). The dpreview site has a good article on setting up this camera which is highly recommended.A camera such as this can be no better than the lenses you get for it. The first question is which of the kit lenses to get. I got the more expensive 12-50 lens for the more versatile range, the weatherproofing, and the macro feature. It also has an electronic zoom feature which is in some ways nice but contributes to its weight. Negatives are that it is heavy (heavier than my telephoto), does not collapse like the cheaper kit lens, and it is somewhat slow at the telephoto side. I've heard complaints about its optical quality but have found it to be quite good (except for some distortion when shooting at wide angles) and the macro feature is also quite good. The 14-42 kit may be better for people who want portability and don't care about the weatherproofing - it is $200 cheaper to boot (but you would likely want to get a telephoto lens in addition, given its limited range). My second lens is the Olympus 40-150, which is the my favorite and the one I use the most. You can get it for $150 if you buy it with the camera and a kit lens. It is amazingly small and lightweight for this sort of range and has very good optics (though in my tests, the 12-50 is a bit sharper). Finally, I have the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 prime lens. This is an excellent indoor lens, and makes the camera more portable and it really blurs the background when it is wide open. All of this is not cheap - it totaled around $1800, but it was well worth it.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "OM-D digital camera", "Author": "Raymond S.

Price may come down when it becomes more readily avaiable. Tried auto focus and manual focus also.  For a neat little package the camera performed absolutely fantastic, just about as good as my Nikno D700 which totally blew me away - especially weighing in at about 1/6 the weight.  The lens that came with the camera was OK, not great but also not bad for a 14-42mm lens f3.5-5.6.  However a friend who was in Tokyo Japan came back with a Panasonic 12-35mm lens for his Panny camera and let me use the lens for a few days------that is really what blew me away and when it becomes available will be my stay on lens.  The lens is not too big for the OMD but may be too big for the pens and some of the pannys, but not on the OMD.  The photos shot at all different combinations of f stops and speed, as well as ISO performed stunningly.  This combination of camera and lens will be my constant companion, I like it better on the OMD than the primes available through Olympus and Panny and I am a diehard non-zoom lens photog, or was until now.  Not going to go into a complete technical review since that has been hashed over by many on this blog.  If you love your current DSLR, you will be madly in love with this combination of the OMD and the 12-35 panny lens - and you can carry it with you constantly.  Of course the oly primes 24mm and the panny 25mm f1.4 are great primes if you insist as I used to on primes over zooms, both produce excellent results.  This is the first time since I purchased my Contax G2 that I was this impressed with a little camera, granted one is a rangefinder and one is a minature dslr.  I still have the Contax and will probably keep it since it still performs well and I just cannot seem to want to part with it.

They were not small enough to truly fit in my pocket, yet they were too small to feel comfortable in hand.

It feels just right in hand -- big enough to feel like a legitimate camera, with an immense menu offering full control over its operation, yet so so small and convenient in comparison to my DSLR.  Image quality is great on the E-M5.  I read more and more about professionals ditching their DSLR and using the E-M5 for paid jobs, and I see why.  Though I'm an amateur I have done the occasional paid shoot for friends of friends, and I'd be very comfortable doing that with the E-M5.  The range of available lenses is excellent as well, with some very nice primes available to produce truly top-notch image quality.  Though not a fast lens, the kit 12-50mm is a versatile performer with decent image quality.  The wide 12mm, the zoom range, the macro function, and the weather sealing make it a natural all-around choice for the E-M5.  Getting the E-M5 has reinvigorated my photography.  I have sold all my other photo gear (both the DSLR and the high-end point and shoots) and am sticking with the OM-D. I no longer have the feeling of being burdened by the weight and bulk of the DSLR, and I don't feel cramped like I did with the high-end point and shoots.

I ended up with a lot of nice pics from my iPhone, but without the color, bokeh (blurring of background), and low light capabilities I want. I knew it was time to either commit to lugging around a lot of metal & glass or settle for inferior pics. Then I started to hear about the E-M5. The pro-site reviews were raving about it, so I decided to go into my OCD mode and spent the following 3 months reading everything I could on the camera. I was torn between going for the 5D Mark III full frame or to abandon the \"pixel peeping\" game and just go for a camera I'll actually have with me. Look, the full frame cameras still turn out better quality pics. This camera had a bunch of other things going for it that could make up for not having the absolute best in image quality.Things that are great:1) Compact & light. Means it comes with me nearly everywhere.2) One of the fastest focusing and very accurate (better than many SLRs) for non-moving objects. 9fps!3) World's first (I believe) 5-way stabilizing technology. This means that no matter which way the camera shakes, the IBIS system will keep the image stabilized. I found I could hand-hold the camera at slow speeds I wouldn't ever dare before (like 1/15!).4) Tilting screen for those awkward shots (like over the crowd, kid-friendly shots from their height,etc).5) EVF. I really missed not being to look through the camera to frame a shot. The back screen is OK, but doesn't work as well as holding the camera to your eye.6) Decent low light capabilities. As I mentioned, this is not a replacement for a full frame camera. This is one reason I didn't give the camera 5 stars.7) Dynamic range similar to SLRs & color accuracy that outdoes nearly any camera (including full frames).8) Decent video, with some pixelation however.Things that are not:1) THis is not the best camera for moving objects. The autofocus can't track objects well. I did manage to snap off some decent pics of my girl's soccer matches, but it was with a bit of a struggle.2) Low light is commendable for such a small camera.

Being new to the DSLR game, the \"philosophy\" of 4/3s seemed very sound to me; high quality lenses that are compact and can be coupled with compact bodies that will put out excellent image quality; of course the added benefit of in-body stabilisation seemed to just make a great sum of parts. I went through a range of 4/3s bodies including the Olympus Evolt E-3 and while I was always pleased with the lenses, the image quality always left more to be desired. Also, once I switched to the E-3, the bulk of the system didn't make sense to me as it was pretty similar to full frame and yet lagged in image quality. After 2 years with 4/3s I finally moved on to the Nikon D700 and have been with it ever since.The caveat of full-frame is obviously the inherent size and weight of the system and I hated being \"the camera guy\" every time I was out with friends or even shooting casually and that's when I started dabbling with micro 4/3s. The initial iterations while exciting, still were slow and not great in terms of IQ, but the E-M5 changed it all. Over the years the system has matured and the E-M5 finally brings a good quality semi-pro body that is small, light, beautiful and most importantly excels in image quality. I use this camera with Panasonic lenses, Panasonic 12-35mm/F2.8, Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0 & Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 Leica Lens and this entire system fits neatly in a shoulder bag with 3 batteries.I've been shooting with this system for 3 months now and have found the image quality to be very similar to my D700. I still use my D700 for paid work because I'm used to it, but I don't see why the E-M5 wouldn't work for anyone that wants to use it professionally. Of course, the depth of field differences will always exist, but those are inherent characteristics of the systems and it's up to the user to make the best or worst of it.Overall, the E-M5 finally realises what 4/3s was supposed to be and I recommend this camera very highly for anyone that's either looking to enter into a camera system or wants to supplement a full frame system with something smaller and lighter. But of course, there are a few compromises, but none that should be detrimental to use. I also like the new stabilisation system which has allowed me to get tack sharp shots at up to 1s of exposure! Also, the weather sealed body makes a huge difference too.This camera is a definite winner.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best m43 yet... but room for improvement", "Author": "Z. Wagner", "ReviewID": "R2TNH553ZI4W7M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been on the m43 bandwagon for quite some time.  I even went so far as to re-invest in a lot of my m43 equipment recently basically because of this camera (I had sold it all off and gone to FF dslr land).  Overall I've been shooting with m43 cameras for a few years.This is absolutely, hands down, the best m43 camera ever produced (I have not shot the Panasonic GH3).  In fact, in my humble opinion, it is one of the best cameras ever produced, period.  There's a reason it was recently voted camera of the year on dpreview.Is it perfect?  Far, far from it.  But when you use a camera like this, it suddenly makes all the possibilities of camera technology pop into your mind, which in turn makes you want more from the camera.  Not because the camera isn't amazing, but simply because it inspires you to think in such a way.  It's so good, it makes you realize that if Olympus and Panasonic stick it out with m43, we are in for some absolutely stellar things in a couple of years' time.--First, it's fast.  It powers up very quickly, and is ready to shoot in almost no time.  Static AF is ridiculously fast.--Changing settings is easy as pie (if you like the Oly menu system... I do).  In fact, I find the camera incredibly intuitive all the way around.--Image quality is a HUGE leap from any previous m43 camera, in pretty much every area.  We're still dealing with the noise that a smaller sensor produces, but we're caught up with APS-C cameras (and even surpassing Canon's APS-C's) in terms of color bit depth and dynamic range.  I can deal with the noise.  Dynamic range was always my chief complaint with m43 sensors... no longer.--The 9fps frame rate is welcome, though there are lots of caveats (see below)--Size and weight are still kept to a minimum, though the camera is built in a much more professional fashion than previous m43 cams.--It's weather sealed!  I have read that people have had small issues with the weather sealing on this camera, but I have yet to experience them.--The screen is great (if not the highest resolution).  I actually prefer it to a fully articulating one, since you don't have to bring it out to the side to angle it.--It's just plain fun to use.  These cameras never feel like a burden, and the OM-D is so intuitive and well-designed, that it's even less of a burden.  It feels natural to walk around with it; it makes taking photos not only a breeze, but a fun, whimsical breeze.  Unless I absolutely require the precision and speed of good phase-detect AF (see below), I pass up my D600 for this camera every. single. time.--The IBIS in the camera is excellent, but I don't find it any better than the OIS in newer Panasonic lens bodies.  That said, I much prefer to have IBIS rather than OIS; I'd rather see the bodies just a hair larger and the lenses smaller.So why is there 'room for improvement'?--Continous AF.  Yup, I'll join the masses and whine about the C-AF.  While there has been limited improvement in this area over time (very slow improvement) on m43 cams, it's still far from there.  If you shoot sports, unless you already focus manually, plain and simple, forget this camera.  It's too bad because 9fps sounds so good.  And in some situations, it's still a boon.  But more often I'm down in the 4fps range where the C-AF actually works (sort of).  Already 4fps is pretty slow for shooting sports, at least really fast-moving ones.  Add to this the fact that you'll likely not have your object of focus... well... in focus, and it can be a frustrating experience.  This can be somewhat mitigated by manual focusing (not all that great with m43 anyway), and by simply knowing the camera.  In slower sports, the static AF is quick enough that you can often just press the shutter button and grab the shot, as long as your brain is quick enough.--The viewfinder, while good, could be a hell of a lot better.  I think EVF technology is where we're going; optical finders will be phasing out in a few years (just my opinion), and they should.  But we also need fast enough processors and refresh rates and resolutions so that we get as little delay as possible when shooting.  9fps is great, but don't think you're going to track the action at that rate.  I guess I'm getting into a little bit of a different conversation than just the viewfinder here; sorry about that.  The next evf needs to be higher res, higher refresh rate (without a drop in resolution).--The camera on its own isn't all that comfortable to hold.  I love the battery grip (and own it), so this doesn't matter all that much to me, and I would have bought the grip regardless.  But I think a bigger hump would have helped make the camera just a little more comfortable without the grip (as you shouldn't have to buy the grip to be comfortable shooting).  I know a lot of people have complained about the buttons as well... I can see why, but they don't personally bother me.--While the sensor is fantastic for m43, there is still a long way to go.  In terms of dynamic range and color bit depth, we're looking very good.  Noise level?  Much improved, but still not there.  I personally don't mind the noise, and I'm still willing to hit 6400 ISO on the OM-D (and really up to 3200 it does decent).  But it will be exciting to see what the next couple of years bring in sensor tech.--It is expensive.I could have given this camera 4 stars and been done with it, but I didn't feel satisfied with that score, simply because there's so much to like in the way of innovation that it pushes it to 5.

Also, using the smaller camera made me feel like I was compromising too much quality in the name of comfort as you can't compare the output you get from a smaller sensor to a DSLR.While I initially scoffed at the m43 format,  the newer generation of bodies and lenses made me take a second look and I decided to take the plunge and sell my old stuff for an Olympus OMD.So far I'm pleased at the amount of lens choices available in the format, however it must be said that this road is NOT any more affordable than a DSLR, it's pretty much as pricey, however, the benefit so far has been to have a similar package quality wise, but in a much smaller size.So far I've been mostly pleased with the OMD's handling and the performance has pretty much met and exceeded my expectations.

It's all about the tight integration between lens and body -- i.e. the M43 design team had the luxury of architecting lenses with electronic sensors in mind, and the bodies were programmed to correct lens distortion.Our Panny G3 was the next big step forward with a higher resolution sensor (16mp) and much better low light performance. That camera produces images comparable to, and often better than, a mid-level APS-C DSLR like our Canon T2i.This camera, the OM-D, is another really big advance. The sensor is still 16 MP but resolution is astoundingly good. The sensor reportedly comes from Sony, but the big deal might be a really great anti-aliasing filter (anti-aliasing reduces sharpness on all cameras, some more than others). OM-D output will be neck and neck with a last-generation full frame DSLR like the Canon 5d Mk2. There are definitely things the 5d will do better but there are also situations where this camera will produce a sharper, more detailed image because of better NR and a newer-technology sensor. A good place to compare the two cameras' output is the Digital Imagine Resources' Comparometer -- use the \"new outdoor\" test image.All this is why there are professional photographers starting to leave their full frame behemoths in the studio and taking this camera on shoots. It certainly means there is no reason whatsoever for enthusiast-level photographers to lug around DSLRs any more. This camera will beat the pants off your average crop sensor DSLR and do so at less than half the size and weight.We've had the OM-D for about a month and just got back from a trip to Paris.

Was a bit concerned about losing the optical viewfinder and fast accurate autofocus (phase detection) of a true SLR. Happy to say most of my fears were unfounded. This is really a great camera for a prosumer, especially paired with the 12mm f/2.0 prime. The combo makes a fast, lightweight camera that you can carry around all day. The resulting pics are unbelievably sharp with great color and detail. My main (and truly, minor) complaints are:- Autofocus. The AF likes to pic random targets in the frame and often seems to arbitrarily reset the focus target mode. This gets frustrating when you're trying to catch a moment and find the camera focusing off somewhere in the background, with a single AF target selected. Perhaps this is a firmware issue, perhaps its just a limitation of contrast detection. That being said, having shot thousands of pics already, the great majority of the time the camera focuses quickly and on target. Also, despite Olympus' claims, contrast detection just does not work for fast action. Continuous mode AF (even with tracking) does not really work well - the camera too easily gets distracted. Yes the camera can shoot 9 fps, but they'll all be out of focus...UPDATE: you can set an \"autofocus home\" target region and then assign a button to quickly reset the autofocus target to that \"home\". This helps a lot. Also pressing the buttons toggles between home and the last set target. Nice.- Battery life. As expected with both an electronic viewfinder and a huge OLED on the back, the OM-D sucks battery life. I get a few hundred shots max from a battery, far less if I have both the EVF and the OLED on all the time. Be prepared to invest in several extra batteries. I bought 3 - one OEM (overpriced) and then 2 Wasabi which seem to give pretty similar performance to the OEM at half the price for 2. Fortunately the batteries are lightweight so its easy to carry a spare or two in your pocket.- EVF. I'm still not a huge fan and do miss a real optical viewfinder. The EVF always seems too bright despite turning the brightness way down.UPDATE: discovered the brightness is a result of a feature called LIVE VIEW BOOST. It can be turned off in custom menu D, and then both the EVF and screen will show something much closer to the actual brightness level, as well as showing the effect of exposure compensation changes.- UI. The Olympus SCP (Super Control Panel) is powerful but a bit quirky. Also the integration with the touchscreen is halfway - you can touch to select an option, but then have to use the dials so change settings.- Handfeel. The build quality is fantastic but the camera is definitely small (even for someone with small hands), with some sharp edges and hard angles, and a little hard to grip. Adding the landscape grip is almost a necessity for extended use. It completely changes the feel without considerably changing the profile or weight of the camera.Overall, a totally awesome camera that I'm still learning how to use (see UPDATES above).

You know this Canon model delivers good image quality and everyone knows that they have lots of years in the photography market. I have no doubt about it.But my review is based on personal experience solely. I don\u2019t want to compare these two models exhaustively.I am an amateur photographer and I know how carrying big equipment is. Carrying a body, three lenses, flash and tripod is heavy if you do it all day.

My neck also suffers. Moreover, I have been operated from a hernia twice and I try not to lift too much weight now.I think by now you must understand why I have chosen this marvelous Olympus OMD EM5: Its size and weight. These were my main reasons..at the beginning.It arrived ok and in desired time. I also bought the prime 12mm and 45mm.  I confess the menu is not as intuitive as the Canon\u2019s, but you get used to it as long as you shoot with this camera. You also have to deactivate the \u201cwarm\u201d skin color feature for a more precise color rendering. Now that I have used it for about three months, I think this is the best camera for me. Its image quality is excellent! I won\u2019t state it\u2019s better than the Canon, but I do agree they both have almost the same quality. (with the 12 and 45mm). And if you have the same quality of a DSLR, why would you like to continue carrying extra weight with you? Yeah, there is a crop factor of 2x, but WHO CARES? I don\u2019t , for me it is just the perfect camera.For others may not be the perfect one, because of the size of the buttons (small) or crop factor , but for me it is just the best one.

If you already have alot of SLR lenses, you might want to get an adapter and stay in your ecosystem.Check out the reviews on dpreview and other sites for objective technical stuff. Here are a few pros and cons I've noticed.Pros- good selection of lenses available - APSC didn't have anywhere close the the same choices for fast lenses at different lengths; you can choose an adapter with most mirrorless to use a wider assortment of lenses, but those full size lenses on adapters are bigger, heavier, and more expensive, defeating the purpose of a camera like this I think- small size (not pocketable, but tiny next to a full size SLR like the EOS 5D MkIII)- lenses are easy to carry (a 300mm is half the size of a full frame 200mm, and reaches farther due to 2x multiplication)- very good built in IS- fast at 9fps (1 focus) or 3.5fps (focus each shot); writes to a fast SD card are fast- weather sealed- great image quality, even in JPG, for the sensor size, way better than any pocket cam I've tried from Nikon or Canon- tilt display- kit lenses are inexpensive add ons; the 12-50 has a decent macro modeCons- flash is an included clip on not built in pop up; looks like it will be easy to break, so I plan to use fast lenses instead of flash whenever possible- preview/focus view shows you the exposure in the overlay (exposure meter, histogram, etc), but not in the preview image itself (at least that I can figure so far). So if you take a shot just by looking at the image in very light or dark conditions or with the wrong exposure settings, you can see a properly lit viewfinder image turn into a solid white or solid black saved picture.- the two part battery grip is practically required if you have large hands or want to use a large lens, but it's a few hundred extra- focus isn't as predictable up close or in low light as a mirrored camera (but this one is probably the fastest mirrorless focus)- 12-50 kit lens could be faster/brighter- like most compact systems with full time LCDs the battery life isn't great (few hundred shots)- would be nice if the tilt display was easier to open, and more tiltable or reversible for self-shooting, but those abilities would add bulk I guessNit picking- have to fiddle with customizing buttons to get ISO adjustment out to an easily changed control. default has it buried under several submenus- have to remove the grip to change internal battery- just about every Olympus lens that fits does not come with a bag, case, or hood; their plastic hoods are overpriced.- discovered after a few days the default JPG quality setting was normal, not fine", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgrade from Canon APS-C DSLR", "Author": "Yau Fong Chan \"Kylab\"", "ReviewID": "R1GSU7VFZFW0IH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned Canon XS since 2009 and bought Canon 650d last year.

My first was the PEN E-P1. I also own a Nikon D40 and D700 DSLRs.Overall I'm very happy with this camera. It is an excellent mix of compactness and quality. Coupled with some of the good Micro Four-Thirds glass out there, I've found it can most of the time easily be used in place of my DSLRs without worrying about comprising.Some Pros:+ Compact size. This may go without saying, but is definitely a plus especially after lugging around much larger DSLRs. The OM-D feels just about the right size for me. It's not pocketable per-se, so I would keep that in mind if you want a pocket camera. You'll need to keep it around your neck or in a case. While not pocketable, it it's big enough to accommodate a large number of physical controls and an EVF. There are certainly many more smaller mirrorless cameras, but having the additional controls and features is worth it to me. If you really are determined to pocket the camera, you might get away being able to do it with a pancake prime lens.+ Controls. I feel Olympus did a good job in designing the physical controls on the body. Almost every button's function can be changed. Sometimes getting exactly what you want requires a bit more effort then I think it should, but the level of customizability is excellent and something I wish more cameras would allow. For example, I have one button switch the camera between a manual-focus mode that will focus on demand with the Metering button and an auto-focus mode that will meter and autofocus and meter by holding down the shutter half-way.+ Good Sensor. I've been very happy with the IQ from the sensor so far. It also performs admirably in low light. I don't mind pushing up the ISO if need be. I'm perhaps a bit more forgiving then most with High-ISO, although being used to a full-frame DSLR I'm still happy with the OM-D's high-ISO performance. The noise is much better then other Micro Four-Third cameras that I've used. Sure, overall compared to many APS or Full-Frame DSLRs it has room for improvement, but it does really well and is a notable improvement over other cameras in its class. It's good enough that I'll use it instead of my D700 in many cases. If I need a little more and don't mind a heavy camera I'll grab my DSLR.+ Built-in EVF. Personally, I prefer OVFs, but as far as EVFs go the E-M5's is pretty good. There is a setting that allows for a greater refresh rate as well, which helps with action. The EVF is great however if you're in bright light or just prefer to put your face up to the camera rather then using the back LCD.+ Good AF. AF is fast, provided you have a fast lens. My 45mm lens focuses quickly, although my 20mm Panasonic is notably slower. The camera will focus the lens as fast as it is able to.+ Good LCD screen. The LCD screen is clear and bight. It also swivels out so it can face upwards and downwards. Useful if you are shooting at weird angles or at the hip.+ Good Body. The E-M5's body feels like it has a bit heavier then you may expect from a compact mirrorless camera, but it feels solid and well built. It's also weather-sealed, so if you go out in the rain with a weather-sealed lens you wont have to worry about it. The camera is also attractive cosmetically.+ Lenses. There are good selection of lenses out there. Panasonic and Olympus makes many good primes. There are also adapters for pretty much every lens system you can think of. Granted, they are mostly manual focus, but you can get some good deals on older lenses if you don't mind that. The E-M5 can set the shutter speed and ISO for you while you control the focus and aperture on the lens. Some great older lenses, like old Minolta MC/MD lenses, can be found for cheap on ebay. I kind of wish there were more manufactures making u4/3 lenses, but it's getting better, and the choices out there are pretty good. Some of them are VERY good for the price.+ Good JPEG / \"ART\" modes. I usually shoot RAW, but the ART modes on the E-M5 are actually pretty decent and can be fun to play around with. There's also a trick to use one of the art modes to assist with manual focusing (focus-peaking) that helps with older lenses.+ Touchscreen. The camera has a touchscreen that can be used to adjust some of the controls, change the focus point, or trigger the shutter. You don't need to use it however. You can also disable it to reduce the risk of accidentally hitting it with your fingers or cheek.Drawbacks:- Weight. It doesn't bother me, but some people may wish it weighed less for a compact camera.- Menus. There are a lot of menus that can be unlocked, and a lot of things that can be done in them. I feel they could be a bit more intuitive. The controls are great if you use the numerous physical controls, but sometimes requires a bit of hunting if you have to go down into the menus. Chances are, the camera can do it, but you have to find out how.- Focus Tracking. The E-M5 has it, but it can probably be better.- 20mm Panasonic Lens. This is a popular lens, and one I use and like, so it's probably worth mentioning. Sometimes the E-M5 has a banding issue with this lens. I've reproduced this issue myself. It's more prevalent at higher ISO settings and if the image is under-exposed. I've had times when it hasn't come up at all. This isn't a JPEG processing issue in the camera. It shows up in the RAW image as well. Most of the time the lens works fine. Olympus has announced that they are working on a fix, but it's still an issue (as off 2/04/2013). If you have this lens or are considering it, be aware that this may happen. My other lenses don't experience this issue.- Battery Life. Unsurprisingly for a mirrorless camera the battery life isn't spectacular. It gets maybe 300 give-or-take shots per-charge. Always carry a spare on you. There are some cheaper third-party batteries out there. Battery life can be improve by keeping the main LCD off, using a self-powered flash, and using a battery-grip. It could be better, but I've used some mirrorless and compact cameras with worse.- EVF: As much as an EVF is a pro, I feel it's sometimes a con. There are the typical draw backs as usual. Using some shooting modes, especially art modes, slow down the refresh rate. Compared to an OVF it's less practical for action and manual focusing. That's the nature of an EVF however. It's more of knowing what you're getting into more then a true disadvantage. There is a slight delay in the EVF turning on when you put your eye up to the viewfinder, which can be a problem, but you can adjust the settings to always keep it on if you like, or manually switch to the EVF rather then having the eye sensor do it for you.- Control Size - I don't have a problem with the controls, but people with big fingers or are wearing gloves may find it more difficult to use. The buttons are a little small. It's a small camera though.Overall I think the E-M5 is a great camera. It might have a few drawbacks, but they are typical drawbacks that's common of many mirrorless cameras. Olympus also greatly improved on many of the what were weaknesses of previous u4/3 cameras. It's expensive relative to other compact cameras, and perhaps a little bulkier, but it's feature rich and a good choice for people who want a combination of small site, lots of controls, and not have to sacrifice on quality.UPDATE 06/10/2013:I've been using this camera for a few months. I continue to be impressed with it. I find that it fulfills most of my needs that my DSLR does and the impressiveness of it along with good glass produces. Its quality, controls, along with its size make me a satisfied buyer. I don't feel like I'm making any major compromises other than the batter, unlike with the E-P1, and if I have this on my with instead of my D700 I can achieve what I need in the majority of situations as long as I have a spare battery or two.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera of the year", "Author": "Mark Baylor", "ReviewID": "R2NKEF7ESOTXBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera won camera of the year for good reason.

You can safely shoot to about ISO 6400 in most conditions, but I keep mine at base ISO (100) almost all the time.If you haven't shot M43 before, you'll need to get used to shooting closer to wide open to avoid diffraction, which leads to shorter shutter speeds (with improved hand-holdability) and lower ISOs (also great). This also means you can shoot at f/5.6 with nearly everything in focus. This makes M43 great for landscape photography, where low ISO, short shutter speeds, and deep DOF are all advantages! Those traits paired with the world-class in-body image stabilization of this camera allow you to shoot handheld in situations where a full-frame Canon or Nikon would need a heavy tripod to get a sharp image. I've handheld exposures over a second long with sharp results, which blew my mind a bit.Overall, after shooting with this camera and my full-frame Canon side-by-side for a couple of months, I find my Canon collecting dust in the bag while sitting back in my closet on most trips, and I can't wait to expand my M43 lens collection. It's a lot of fun to shoot with, and really makes you enjoy your photography experience even more.

Don't get me wrong, I love this little camera. The AF is insanely fast and accurate and the image quality is great. Here is the list of pros and cons I could come up with.Pros:- Super fast AF. Around the same speed as my Nikon D7000 and probably more accurate. It almost never missed focus.- Lightweight and small. Other have said with the pancake lens it will fit in your pants pocket. They must have really big pockets. There's no way I can fit it with the pancake lens on into a jean pocket. A jacket pocket sure, but not my pants.- Weather sealing!- Touch screen. This is an awesome feature. I can give my wife the camera and tell her to tap the screen on someones face and it takes the picture perfectly in focus.- Lots of lenses to choose from.- Image quality is really good.- Low light noise is pretty amazing for a sensor this small. If you're showing pics on the web, ISO 1600 and 3200 look great and I don't hesitate to use either. ISO 25600 is a marketing trick, it looks like my son drew a water color painting, ISO 12800 isn't great either.- It's built like a tank- The electronic viewfinder is a really nice addition although it's not as nice as an optical viewfinder on any DSLR I've ever used.- Large high quality LCD on the back- Battery life is very good. I took around 300 shots over a three day period and it was still at 3/4 full battery.- The way they positioned the two command dials works perfectly. The thumb and pointer finger rest on both allowing easy access to changing settings.Neutral:- The menu system is neither great nor terrible it just takes some getting used to.- The Buttons are mushy feeling and very small. The camera is small so it's kind of what I expected.Cons:- The included external flash is really weird. It's this tiny little thing you have to carry around in a pouch and it's really awkward to attach it to the camera. They should have just moved the viewfinder over to the side and put a flash in the camera with a hotshoe on top. It's a direct flash and doesn't allow you to pull it back and bounce it. I probably won't use it much if at all.- It's bit hard to firmly hold if you have big hands. I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it if I hold it with 1 hand. The grip could be improved.- The metal strap connectors are in a weird place and you have to put them in between your fingers to grip the camera.- The price was a little hard for me to swallow. For what you get it's probably the right price but it's still a lot of money.- This camera does not give DSLR quality images. I can easily spot any pic from my D7000 over a pic from the Olympus. The images are fantastic, don't get my wrong. But the look of the pictures from the camera is a little flatter and less 3 dimensional than a DSLR. It's hard to explain but the bigger sensor in bigger cameras does make a difference in image quality.Final ThoughtsYes the image quality is fantastic but for me this camera does not replace my Nikon D7000. Pictures from my Nikon just look slightly more realistic and have more pop to them. I bought this camera because I hate lugging my DSLR around. It's big and bulky and I never take it hiking or fishing with me. I wanted something that had close to DSLR quality images but in a tiny package I could carry everywhere. I wanted fast and accurate AF and I wanted it to be easy enough for my wife to use. I also wanted interchangeable lenses. With the Olympus I got everything I asked for. No it's not a DSLR replacement like I had hoped it would be. I wouldn't shoot weddings with this camera.

Coming from a Nikon D700, I also wanted to get a new DSLR so that I can also shoot videos. So far I have really liked the camera and plan to take it on my next travel destination. I still prefer using my D700 and fast Nikon lenses when I don't have to worry about weight or need video, but it looks like the EM-5 will be my travel companion for now.As other reviewers have already noted, the image quality is very good and high ISO performance is as good as my D700.The kit lens is nice but I wish it was faster. It's 12-50mm 3.5-6.3 ... 6.3 is painfully slow (guess I'm spoiled by my fast Nikon lenses) and forces you to bump up the ISO really high when shooting low light scenes. If the kit lens was f2.0-4.0, that would have been awesome.There is no lens hood for the lens. Even the VERY expensive 12mm f2.0 lens does not come with a hood, forcing me to buy a cheapo $8 one from Amazon (which works fine btw.)Movies on the EM-5 are pretty good but not as good as some of my Sony compacts or zooms, such as the HX-100v. I think Sony cameras have the best videos. They look smooth and vibrant and overall more pleasing than anything I've used.The battery charger unit requires a separate power cable, what a hassle!! C'mon Olympus, it's 2012!!And the OEM BLN-1 battery sells for $60, and it's not even available.I purchased this kit -- \"Two New BLN-1 Batteries & One Charger Combo for Olympus OM-D E-M5\" for $34 + shipping -- from bestbatt.com. You get TWO batteries, a wall charger. The wall charger works for the offbrand batteries as well as the OEM BLN-1, which was a limitation I found with the many battery kits on Amazon. The camera also shows the battery gauge for the offbrand camera. The wall charger that came with the kit has a \"KAPAKEN\" logo on it, some Chinese knock off I guess. But it works fine and I am very happy with it.Overall I am very happy with the camera aside from the annoyances above.

The video from the E-M5 is bright, vivid and razor sharp - so much so I will be selling my top of the line Panasonic TM900 camcorder which produces sharp, but relatively dull and bland video by comparison.  The 12-50 kit lens of the E-M5 also has a power zoom feature like camcorders have (though it's limited to 4x magnification).  And then on top of that it ALSO has a macro mode so you can focus on objects a mere 1 inch away from the lens.The still photo jpeg quality of the E-M5 outdoors is excellent, just like the already excellent Pen cameras which beat the Canon T2i T3i, 60D, Nikon 5100, 7000, etc for image detail and sharpness combined with vivid, yet realistic colors (I know because I used to own a T3i).  In low light the E-M5 does much better than the Pens.I can't think of anything much to criticize about the E-M5 other than one minor quirk -  on mine I found out through trial and error the Gradation needs to be set to High Key to produce stunningly brilliant colored outdoor jpeg images like the Pen cameras deliver with the Gradation set to Normal.I love the way the E-M5 AUTOMATICALLY activates it's built in viewfinder when you put your eye up to it.  Just so many unique features like that which cannot be found on the behemoth sized Canon T2i, T3i, 60D, Nikon 5100, 7000, etc. or the prosumer camcorders.The E-M5 is thus a jack of all trades - top quality stills as well as video, camcorder-like power zoom and image stabilization - super macro mode -  there's practically nothing you can't do with the E-M5!", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this camera !!!", "Author": "Karl Havens", "ReviewID": "R3L621FND6RFP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has a major learning curve.

I took it for warranty repair and it works perfectly now.(just wanted to mention this issue)The menu is incredibly simple but it does have hundreds of possible variations and a bunch of personalized buttons. So I do recommend reading the instructions, in order to set it up with the personal needs of everyone.

I do believe it's good, but it depends mostly on the lenses in my opinion, for example the stock lens 12-50mm Lens is not as fast focusing as it is with 17mm 1.8, but again it might be just me.Regarding the stock lens, I'm not quite satisfied with it, just a regular lens, nothing special, I like the lock it has to pass from electric to manual and it's fun for macro shots. I found it awesome that it is weather sealed as well as the camera, it has saved me more than once.The rear screen its really nice, the fact that it's adjustable to whatever angle you need make it really useful on some situations. I took most of my pics from it, as I feel the EVF is not as accurate with the color.As with al MFT cameras low light photo is a problem since they dont get as much light as a DSRL, however there's and increible upgrade from the EPL2 I had in terms of high ISO as it doesn't get as much noise. Also there a bunch of lenses that are quite fast to help with this (45 1.8mm is REALLY good)Image and video quality is excellent, image stabilization on camera helps a lot, too.There's a few things that can be improved, but I'm definitely not changing my camera for a couple years, I do love where MFT and Olympus are going.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful size and photo quality", "Author": "Pilot Mark in Arizona, USA \"Pilot Mark\"", "ReviewID": "R396D8DJ5E5GLC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the menu system is daunting at first, but I'm getting accustomed with where to go when I need to change a function.

I stopped using that Nikon like 5 years ago altogether and it is, I believe, still duly collecting dust some where very deep in my house...Even though I have been in a fairly camera-friendly environment, and used many digital cameras, from Canon 20D to 5D, and many small point and shoot's, through my work and friends. I haven't bought a single digital camera.The idea I give up my own money to buy one never came across my mind(and I shop Amazon a lot!).The photography as a hobby seemed somewhat a distant idea to me.That was up until two weeks ago when I bought the OM-D. The day I found this camera online by some coincidence,I simply clicked to buy it. I didn't even think twice. No hesitation whatsoever! After two weeks everyday use(take it to work, parks, church, In n Out, restaurants wherever I go)I still got no regret having bought this thing in such a hurried fashion.Now I'm dragging a bit too long...so I'll just say what I was originally going to say:This camera is so small and FUN to shoot with, is all.Thanks!", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thank you, Olympus...", "Author": "Christopher Anderson \"Splnkr\"", "ReviewID": "R1OS5RREWJGGVI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you for finally getting the 4/3rd's concept right!

One thing of note, it almost seems smaller than my old OM-4T! The accessory hand/battery grip will make this camera shine...UPDATE JAN 2013: Added the Olympus HLD-6 Battery Holder.  Now this camera is literally the perfect fit in the hand.  And the design of the HLD-6 left little lacking.  It is rock solid between the body and tripod. Love it! And the extra battery is nice too.UPDATE MARCH 2013: Purchased a second OM-D mainly for my girl friend to have so we can share lenses.

We used to have a big problem in the summertime when customers would buy huge camera outfits only to bring them back a week later covered in sand from their vacation! So I pay attention to detail when I open camera boxes.  As soon as I opened the box on this second OM-D I could tell it had been rummaged through. Flipping the lid, I saw the warranty card, and English instruction manual. No plastic bag. Odd. The body cap was on upside down. And the camera dials were in random placement. The flash looked like it had been carried in a pocket for a day or so--slight marks. The LCD screen still had the self-adhering plastic on it. But the body had the eyelets for the neck strap pre-installed. The first body I bought I had to install them myself. But here is the kicker: when I went into the secret ROM bank to check how many times the camera had been turned on, I found 92! And, to beat all, the camera was telling me it had taken over 770 images! That's more activations and pictures than I've taken with my original body!This was not Amazon's fault. I returned the camera and they immediately sent out a replacement body.  I was very impressed with their return policy.

The best camera is the one you have with you, and all that... on top of that, the image quality is, IMHO, indistinguishable from my Canon APS-C sensor, even at high ISO.Simply put, shooting with this camera has brought the fun back into photography for me.  With this camera and a couple prime lenses, I find I am shooting more, better, lighter and simpler than I ever have before.Technically, the thing is a dream.  It is silky smooth and incredibly fast.If you have the means, and even a little interest - I highly recommend this camera.Do yourself a favor and get a couple fast primes with it too:Panasonic Leica DG Summilux 25mm f/1.4Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 45mm f/1.8<whatever other focal lengths make sense for you>", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ultimately, not the camera for me ... yet.", "Author": "Steve Kass", "ReviewID": "R2DDUO0EHQ7UCC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a big fan of micro 4/3, and I've been keeping an eye out for an upgrade to my Panasonic DMC-G2. Things high on my wish list include in-body stabilization (I shoot with old manual focus lenses a lot) and a better sensor (more dynamic range, in particular), and the must-have list is pretty short: a viewfinder. The OM-D E-M5 looked like it would be \"the one,\" and it's a great camera, for sure. After using it for a while, though, I decided it wasn't right for me.On the plus side, everything folks rave about seems to be true. So why am I sending it back? There are a few annoyances beyond what I expected, and I've got a decent working camera, so I'm inclined to wait and see what comes along in the next few months or year. If nothing better comes along, I might still get the OM-D E-M5. Better sensor, IBIS, superb high-ISO capability... Maybe by then some of the annoyances will be fixed in firmware, too. None of the following are deal-killers alone, but along with the OM-D E-M5's pretty steep price, they tipped the balance for me.1. No way to *completely* turn off the back screen. It can be off for shooting, but as far as I can tell, the playback/review button always defaults to the screen until you tap the LCD/EVF button. If you use the camera at night or in dim places and want to review your shots discreetly, you're out of luck. If I'd kept the camera, I would have made an opaque \"screen protector\" to carry. (On the G2, I flip the screen over, so it's not only off, but also protected.)2. [Note: According to Joe Silver, who commented on this review, the noise is largely addressed by the latest firmware update, version 1.5.] Noisy hum from the image stabilization. If a laptop fan or the sound of a refrigerator in the next room doesn't bother you, this may not bug you. If I'd kept the camera, I would have turned the camera off and on a lot, or I would have turned the main dial to video (where the much softer hum is no problem) except for shooting.3. [Note: According to Joe Silver, who commented on this review, it is possible to bring up the super control in the EVF, though he didn't explain how.]  The EVF and OLED screen aren't just dual displays of the same thing, so it's hard to access every setting using the EVF only. (For example, no super control panel in the EVF, it seems.) If you're under 40 and your eyes can still focus both close and far, you might not mind, but I'd rather not have to wear bifocals or progressives to be able to use a camera. I can program most of the settings I want into the dials or buttons for EVF use, but not everything.4. The grip. If I eventually get the OM-D E-M5, I'll get the add-on grip. Out of the box, this camera is a little awkward to hold with so little to grab on to, and the bottom right corner pokes into my hand. With an extra pound of old glass mounted on it, it's more than awkward.All that said, if anyone asked me to recommend a camera for the serious amateur with relatively deep pockets, this would be on my very short list.

Compliments my fantastic lens collection (Pana 20mm F/1.7, Oly 45mm F/1.8, and Oly 75mm F/1.8, Pana 12-35mm)2.) Dynamic Range: on par with Canon full-frames, I recommend exposing to the right3.) Color: Adobe profiles in LR are surprisingly good.4.) AutoWB: Best of any camera I own(ed).5.)  Image stabilization:  The best I have ever used.6.) EVF:  Make sure to keep lag in check by changing the setting to fast.  This gives a 120 Hz refresh rate, the best I have seen to date.7.) High ISO: Very impressed, the noise levels are near Nikon D7000, and the colors stay true.8.) LCD Screen: Not the highest resolution screen but it does handle sunlight better than Sony NEX-5N9.) Build and Weatherproofing: used it in Cascades during a winter storm with my only weather sealed lens and the combo worked perfectly.10.)  Tonality: Similar to other top digital cameras with only the super Nikon D800 ($3k) being the exception11.) Handling: The OMD is extremely customizable, only complaint is that MySet's names are not editable.12.) Autofocus: Blazing fast and accurate.  The face recognition is great for close to medium distances, it will struggle on far away subjects.  Thankfully, the FNC buttons are configurable and I have mine to zoom.Neutral:1.) Metering:  It does ok, but has a tendency to underexpose if left on its own.2.) Battery Performance:  I shoot with the EVF without auto review.  With these settings, I can shoot around 500 photos.  Otherwise, expect the advertised 330 shots.3.) Low ISO: Disappointed Olympus chose 200 ISO for it base.  With a MFT camera I like to shoot wide-open as much as possible and preferably below F/4.  With a 200 ISO and a 1/4000 shutter speed I am limited.  A neutral density (ND) filter is an annoying must.Cons:1.) Handling: It is almost too small, I highly recommend using a leather wrist strap to improve confidence and usability.  The optional battery grip adds girth to the handle, but that is $300!  This is the only glaring design flaw.  Sony NEX models have this in Aces.2.) JPEG: The highly touted Olympus Pen JPG Engine does not work well with this sensor (oversharpens and noise reduction destroys all fine detail). ALWAYS SHOOT RAW!3.) The AutoFocus points are way too large. If shooting people at a distance with high contrast backgrounds it will focus on the background. I hope that Olympus will update the firmware to give the option of shrinking the size4.)  Only ONE SD card, having a backup is huge plus, they could have made room for a second slot by making the grip larger.  WIN WIN5.) Predictive AF on mirrorless cameras is pathetic, unfortunately OM-D falls into this same category.Summary:Shooting with this camera is just plain fun.  I still have my Full-Frame DSLR that I use for assignments but this is my choice for personal use.  If Olympus debuts a camera with two SD slots I will likely start using this system for my assignments.  I know full well that the tiny sensor cannot compete with a Full-Frame DSLR in super high ISO and super thin DOF.  But it also has its advantages, for one all of my lenses are razor sharp wide-open.  Having more DOF means I can shoot two stops wider open than with a DSLR and still keep the ISO speeds to a minimum.  This is why I ultimately chose MFT, having an APS sensor would mean compromise; I will not get the great bokeh of a Full-Frame, nor do get the greater DOF of MFT's.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "All the features of a DSLR at half tyhe weight.", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R3FTPYMNYG0BQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Small and compact, built remarkably well, full featured, excellent quality, and great photos.This will replace my heavy, bulky DSLR, without sacrificing quality and benefits.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "A little gem!", "Author": "R.

I noticed a few specs that looked like dust in the EV and then I started shooting some pictures and video and sure enough on my first sample there were 2 stuck on pixels in the middle of the picture. On the second camera was far worse as I counted at least 7 total. I will take this back in and see if my camera company has another one and if I have issues with that sample I will wait till they get this rectified. This problem was rectified by using a tool which is not on many cameras called \"Pixel Mapping\"  Not sure if this can be fixed with a firmware update but the in house tool took care of my problems and most likely would have taken care of the first camera I had and returned.  But people who actually own this camera, please check it out, if you take a picture with no flash in a dark room they will pop up even more and they pop up quite a bit during video playback. Slight change to review as this camera is outstanding at picture taking easy too use and the pixel mapper is a excellent built in tool .  I would give it a 4 1/2 stars as the only thing it is lacking is really good video, as the Lumix GH3 is far superior in that category.  The Art settings are a pleasure to use and give great results when it comes to picture taking.

Go here for some images: [...] and click on Flora.------------------------------------------------------------------------------There is a lot to like in the E-M5 and you can find this documented in the copious verbiage dedicated to the E-M5 over the last couple of months. I will focus on aspects that I have struggled with.Here is the context:Zuiko 50mm f2 macro (legacy lens, manual focus)Spot meterClose focus (wild flowers)The EVF reacts very differently than an OVF to changing light conditions (there are some nice advantages with manual lenses). The problem that I have encountered is that as the light changes, the EVF brightness adjusts. This complicates manual focusing. Slight movements in filtered light and the output level of the EVF changes (a breeze in the overhead canopy, a breeze on the subject flower). I have compensated by assigning AEL to f2 and locking the exposure. I would like to be able to disable auto EVF adjust.(on the positive, when using a manual lens and stopping down the aperture, the EVF will maintain constant brightness thus you can actually focus stopped down and see DOF at the same time).The EVF on the E-M5 has a glass lens about 2mm recessed from the hardly adequate eyecup. This means the viewfinder clouds up as eyelashes brush the surface. I have never had this problem before. Maybe the EP-11 will help. Right now I have to clean the glass surface a lot.Lastly, in different shooting conditions, I find myself digging though the menus to adjust the EVF brightness level. I would like to be able to assign a button to this.I assigned 4 stars but it is probably more like 4.5.I am interested in the 60mm macro that will come out but I expect to use it mostly in a manual focus mode. If it is as good as my 50mm f2, it will mostly mean a size and weight advantage.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall a great camera, but has its downsides", "Author": "Bob \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R8NSSLOFTKNYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not going to go into stuff that you could read at review sites, like the image quality of the new sensor. But here are my PERSONAL impressions and comprison to other m43 cameras that I own.THE GOODMy E-PM1 had bad blurring when using the in-body image stabilization at around 1/100 sec. I am happy that the E-M5 doesn't seem to have that problem. This makes the IBIS much more useful.The quality of the EVF is massively improved over the E-PM1 with the VF-3 add-on viewfinder.Love the touchscreen on this way better than the touchscreen on my Panasonic GF-2.EVF automatically switches on when you put your eye up to it. This is a lot more convenient than it might sound.Built-in level is useful if, like me, you find it hard to take perfectly level photographs; useful for landscape photography.THE BADNoticeably bigger and heavier than E-PM1. One of the chief benefits of m43 over DSLRs is that m43 is supposed to be small and light.EXPENSIVE compared to other m43 cameras. Now that the E-PM2 is out, you can get the exact same image quality and most of the functionality of this camera for half the price, plus the E-PM2 has the advantage of being smaller and lighter. Note that the E-PM1 has all of the advanced menu options of the more expensive Olympus cameras, and I assume Olympus is going to continue their policy of not intentionally crippling their less expensive models.HATE the new 12-50mm kit lens. It's twice as big and heavy as the 14-42mm II, but the image quality is extremely disappointing at the wider angle focal lengths. The 14-42mm II offers better overall image quality for less money,  less size, and less weight. I don't use the 12-50, so I wish I had saved money and bought the body only (since I already had a 14-42 II).Buttons mushy and hard to press. It's bad enough that I notice the problem and get annoyed every single time I need to push a button. Less expensive E-PM1 has way better buttons.Focus areas are too big. There's some way to make one focus area smaller, but it's hidden in the menus and ridiculously complicated to use. I managed to figure it out once, but subsequently forgot how I did it.The \"MySet\" custom modes are hard to figure out and unnecessarily complicated. Why not put them on the mode dial instead of the \"Art\" and \"Scene\" modes which don't seem to belong on a $1000 camera geared towards serious amateurs and professionals. You can assign a Myset mode to a button, but it only works while holding down the button, which is almost impossible to do and still hold the camera steady. The implementation of MySet makes absolutely no sense.Can't set exposure compensation in \"M\" mode (which would be very useful combined with auto ISO).EVF eye sensor gets triggered when using the touchscreen. Olympus should have included a physical on-off switch for instantaneously turning that feature on and off. Holding down the button on the side of the EVF for 2 seconds does automatically bring up the menu option, but it still winds up taking several seconds and fiddling with the mushy buttons to switch off the EVF.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremely Smart and Capable", "Author": "EcoActive", "ReviewID": "R36TLWL9NHF0SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic Camera.

Had some older lenses that I thought were not that great but it turned out it was the earlier camera model I had. The 45-200 panasonic has given me insane 3d look pictures. With the 5 axis stability, I turn off the lens mega o.i.s and just do not need it with this marvel of a camera. The 20mm 1.7 is the same a wonderful all around prime. 12-50 it came with is not a cheap kit lens unlike a few other brands will not mention.

The image quality on this camera is great, and the low light performance appears to be better than the D300S at ISO3200 to my eye.  The D300S hasn't been used since I purchased this camera.  This camera is similar to a DSLR in operation and it was easy to transition to it.  The olympus menus can be confusing at first, and I recommend David Busch's OMD guide to help get started.The image quality from this camera is amazing and the RAW files can be manipulated very easily in LR4.  I recommend getting the 12mm F2, the 17mm F1.8, and the 45mm F1.8 from Olympus.  These lenses work great on the OMD.  The kit lens is ok image quality wise but can't compete with the primes.  The best thing about the kit lens is the weather sealing if you are out in the rain or snow.  The camera and kits lens make a good rough weather combination.  We spent a week on the Caribbean on a small catamaran in rough seas, and there was never an issue.  And the lens was fine for family photos.The only con about the camera is the C-AF.  It shouldn't even be called C-AF when compared with the D300S.  There is no comparison.  So if you're a big sports or bird photographer, you should consider a higher end DSLR. However, saying that, the S-AF is fast enough to get some nice sport photos if you know the sport you're shooting and can plan for the shot.  I've taken some very nice volleyball photos despite the C-AF limitations.I highly recommend the camera.

Suffice it to say, Olympus loaded a lot of state of the art features into one camera, including the new 16 Megapixel sensor with much improved dynamic range, 5 axis image stabilization that acts as a steady-cam when capturing video, very fast contrast detect autofocus, and 9 frames per second shooting speed (with initial autofocus) all packaged in a beautiful metal body with retro styling and dual control dials.

Because there are so many options out there I felt trepidatious when making the purchase, but I have been using this camera steadily for 2 weeks now and am liking it more by the day.My main goal was to find a camera combining a compact body with great image quality. The E-M5 exceeded my expectations in this regard. Relative to DSLRs which are similarly priced, this camera is small and light. It also sports a nice sealed body which is a perfect choice for fellow outdoor enthusiasts (I mostly use this camera while out hiking, hunting, fishing, and light rain or heavy humidity do not seem to get past the case). As for the image quality, I can only compare it to my Canon point and shoot camera and the camera on my iPhone. In any case, this has been a very noticeable step up. The picture is very sharp with brilliant color. I have been using the Panasonic 20mm/f1.7 Lumix and the Olympus 45mm/f1.8 M. Zuiko (lenses reviewed separately). Finally, the camera is easy to use. I am, of course, using less than half of the features the camera offers but to this point it has been very user friendly and I've only needed to refer to the owner's guide (which is inherently very boring but well organized) once.If it's within your budget, I'd highly recommend pairing this camera with the Panasonic 20mm/f1.7 as a start for all around photography.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera for up to 16x20 prints", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "RS8HZ7DZ5WJKK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used Minox to 8x10 cameras for decades since one could play golf with just one club but it sure is nice to have a bag full of clubs instead.

The Olympus and Panasonic kit lenses can create great images but  with adapters, I can get even more creative images by using my old Leica, Nikon, Canon FD, Canon EOS, Olympus, Pentax, Mamiya 645 and even Hassleblad lenses on this camera, all of which might be manually focused but all are image stabilized.  The only reason to use my old medium format lenses is by adding the Lensbaby Nikon lens mount tilt mount, and then use MF lens to Nikon adapters since the MF lenses have a huge image circle.

The number of \"likes\" and comments I receive since upgrading to the OM-D E-M5 is fairly dramatic.  It takes beautiful photos effortlessly.  I almost feel guilty that someone like myself, who doesn't fully understand film speed and f-stops etc. can take such incredible looking photos.  My husband (who does understand traditional photography) is the one who purchased the camera but now he can't get it away from me...we may need two!The kit lens it came with is very versatile.  It has a macro setting that takes incredibly sharp photos that blur in the background. Simply touch the part of the flower (or whatever) you want to be the main focal point and the camera does the rest.  Also, the waterproofing on the kit lens really works; it rains a lot where I live and I took it out in a full rain storm to shoot some foggy trees and had no problems.  We bought a 45mm lens for the camera as well. It took unbelievably sharp, bright photos of our cat in a nearly dark room at night with only one tiny light source.  I still don't understand how it did that!Anyway, if anyone is interested in seeing some of the photos I've taken with this camera you can check out my Facebook page (search in Google for Alaskan Artist Elise Tomlinson) Keep in mind that with some of the earliest shots I didn't have any clue what I was doing and I had the setting set on manual settings when I thought it was Auto because the placement on the dial is on the opposite side of my old camera...also, all of these photos were taken hand-held (no tripod).I have also had a lot of fun playing with the built in art filters.  I'm careful about telling people if a photo was taken using a filter, just because I usually try to capture reality.Another thing I love (which everyone is probably commenting on) is that it's small enough I can carry it with me everywhere...so I never miss a shot.  Sometimes I just take shots of nothing interesting at all because the sound and feeling the camera makes when you depress the button to take a photo, is SO satisfying.The only thing I have been disappointed with with this camera (and it is very minor) is that it doesn't seem to have any built-in memory.

So, the looks of the OM-D took me on a forced march down memory lane. I read every review I could find as of June, 2012 to reassure myself that I wasn't making an expensive impulse buy.The evening of day 1 with this camera, I was in front of my house, spinning the controls for ISO, custom WB, and exposure compensation and watching the results of my guesses in the EVF. I was trying to get a plausible rendering straight out of the camera of dusk sky, porch lights, passing cars, and the weird yellow street lights our town has; all in the same shot.Summary of experimental results:1.  Wow. I can see approximately what I'm doing to color and exposure in the EVF. Off-the-sensor trumps through-the-lens.2.  Holy crap! This thing works in available darkness.After six months, I have these somewhat more sophisticated thoughts about some failings of a great camera.1. It has MySets, which is a way to jump to a previously customized setup with one button push. However, you can't name the Mysets, save them elsewhere, or see what is in them after you create them. You can't even determine from the manual which settings are being controlled.2. You can customize what appears in menus and the functions that buttons and dials perform but you can't save your customizations. The only way to untangle things if you make a mess is to reset all functions and start again.3. Features sometimes get in each others way. For example, if you want to view already-stored pictures in the EVF, it is possible, but only if the EVF auto-switch is off. If you want to conserve battery by leaving the back screen off except when you want to use it as the super control panel, it is possible, but only if the EVF auto-switch is on. So, if you want both features, you are stuck with an obscure set of button pushes that includes holding a button for 8 seconds to toggle auto-switching.Luckily, these flaws seem like ones that can be solved in software. Olympus, are you checking reviews? You have a 5 star game-changer camera and some trivial software cleanup to do.********Edited on 2/20/2013*******I still very much like this camera. However, when I started using the little kit flash regularly I discovered one more 'unfortunate' design choice. This one is not as easy to remedy as software.To insert and remove the flash, you have to keep track of 3 small pieces. There is a piece of plastic inserted in the hot shoe to protect it. This is as expected. However, the flash has another connector and both the flash and the camera have little protectors for this connector. This brings the number of things that have to be fiddled with and kept track of in order to simply mount the flash up to five. It's amazing how inconvenient the two 'extra' pieces are if you don't have a place to set things down.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "OMD EM5", "Author": "ZIJI", "ReviewID": "R13J912V8MT48A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sensational camera , however just a bit too small for me , and the ergonomics are so-so unless the optional battery grip is purchased.

So i tried Sony NEX-5n, Nikon J1, Fuji x100 and Fuji X-Pro1. My personal favorite is Fuji x100 but I chose Olympus e-m5 because of fast auto focus, tilting touchscreen, good video quality and image stabilization.99% of my photos are of my family/people and this is why this camera is only 3 stars. The only reason i bought Olympus OM-D E-M5 is because of E-P3. I read a lot of reviews about great olympus colors in e-p3. I also tried out e-p3 and liked what I saw. After 6 months of taking people photos with E-M5, I don't think its as good as e-p3. High ISO is great but colors and dynamic range is not that good. I think my old Nikon d200 is much better for people pictures and Fuji cameras that I tried are miles ahead of E-M5 for people photos. You may be tempted to buy E-M5 to capture kids with fast auto focus but skin colors are not that good, they are brownish looking. My iphone 5 has better skin colors than E-M5.I brought rating up to 4 stars after tweaking color profiles, for best skin tones, for me camera works best when it is set to Vivid with -1 saturation and -4 contrast. The rest I adjust in apple's Apperture and SnapseedI do like video quality because of the image stabilization and skin colors are good in video mode. Not sure why I like skin colors better in video more than in photos. Video quality is a major reason why i haven't sold this camera, my plan is to buy fuji as my second camera. Image stabilization is amazing, should have been technology of the year in 2012.- update 04/08/2013After using this camera for almost a year, I can say that this is a great camera. Good job Olympus for putting so much into it. Please improve skin tones for daylight conditions. I love skin tones that I get in low light, with such great lenses, this would be awesome portrait / people camera, it would be miles ahead of Fuji as a complete package.

I love it. But it has failed me at times because I didn\u2019t want to lug it around. In situations where I am going to be walking around for hours it just got too burdensome. So I got very interested when the Olympus EMD-EM5 came out. I kept reading reviews that said it was a DSLR killer. It was \u2018almost\u2019 as good as a DSLR. It \u2018approached\u2019 DSLR levels or quality. You have to go full frame to notice any difference.I bought into the hype. I am writing this to separate reality from the hype.Here are the best aspects of the Olympus. In some ways it really does live up to the hype. For stationary subjects in good light it is very close in quality to my Nikon. I still think the Nikon is better. The Olympus has a slightly more digital look and the colors are not as natural looking. But still, I was very satisfied with the results. Everything in life is a compromise and the Olympus delivered in compact light availability. I considered it a fair trade. In good light the Olympus auto focus was faster than the Nikon and I really appreciated the touch screen that allows you to tap where you want the focus and take a picture. I wish Nikon\u2019s had that.Here is where the Olympus failed me. This might not even matter to you but for me it was a deal breaker. In my travels I like to attempt to get good pictures while I am a passenger in a car. It is inherently a hit or miss proposition. The road can be bumpy. The subjects are constantly moving. It seems like miraculous sheer luck when it happens. But it does happen. At least it happened occasionally with my Nikon. The Olympus did not deliver in this situation. It didn\u2019t come close. It is what made me fall out of love with the camera. If that doesn\u2019t matter to you then get the Olympus if lighter more compact equipment is important to you.On a side note consider this. I really did buy into the hype and bought all in. I purchased the Panny 20mm f1.7 pancake and the Panny f2.8 12-35 and the Panny f2.8 35-100. But as soon as I put on the 12-35 I regretted the purchase. Once you start putting on substantial zooms like that the light compact advantage of the camera is greatly compromised. The only lens I ever really wanted to use was the 20mm pancake. They are all great lenses. But good quality zooms compromise the whole point of getting the camera.As a result of my experience and personal priorities I ended up trading in all my Olympus equipment for another compromise. I got the latest Nikon mid-level camera with the kit lens. The Nikon D5300 with the new 18-55 VR II is half the weight of my Nikon D7000 with the 18-200 VR II. It doesn\u2019t have all the direct controls I liked with the D7000. The lens doesn\u2019t have the reach I would like. But the end result is satisfying pictures with no compromise.

Thus, I thought I might change my camera to reflect this shift in my preferences. I was very tempted to buy one of those newly released full frame DSLRs (D600 was particularly tempting), but decided that the increase in size, weight, and cost of both the body and lenses was not worth it (I take most of my photos on backpacking trips).The OMD-EM5 looked like a possibility, especially because of its in-camera IS as my primes (12mm, 25mm, 45mm, and 75mm) do not have IS. Also, I have seen some comments that if you are into video, get the GH2, if you are into stills, go with the OMD. Finally, after seeing a refurbished model at a reasonable price, I decided to order it and give it a try. After playing with it for a couple of hours, I am getting an impression that it is not a keeper for me.I knew that this camera had serious disadvantages compared to the GH2, most importantly the lack of a microphone input and the higher price. I still want to have an option to shoot some videos and not having an external microphone input means that I would not be able to do that. I can buy an adapter attached to the hot shoe, but then there is no place for the mic itself. The price is almost twice as high for this camera as I am writing this review (I recently bought a second body GH2 new for five hundred, and the refurbished OMD would be at least eight hundred if I sold the lens it came with). Still, I was hoping that I would like this camera well enough to keep it just for the sake of taking still pictures.I did find out some nice things about this camera by putting my hands on it. The most noticeable advantage is how sexy it looks and feels compared to GH2. If I was picking a camera at the store it would be very hard to resist the temptation to go with this beauty. The screen and EVF are also much better than GH2's. Also, even though the tilting screen is not as versatile as GH2's articulating screen, the limitations did not bother me, and I felt that I could get used to this camera's grip with time.However, what I did not like was that this beautiful screen was permanently exposed and could not be turned around and closed like on the GH2. When I close the screen and put a lens cap on my GH2 I feel like I can roll and toss the camera around as much as I want - in a bag, tent, car, etc. Not with this thing.I knew from reading stuff online beforehand that the picture quality and dynamic range for these two cameras are basically a wash, possibly with the OMD holding a slight advantage (especially because these days I exclusively shoot raw files - being able to improve DR of my pictures in Lightroom is totally amazing). Where I was hoping to see an improvement was the auto focus, but after testing both cameras with my Oly 75 mm lens I figured that they both miss about as many shots when I am trying to take pictures of my black dog running around with a ball.This camera is going back to the store, and I think I will be better off with my GH2 if I buy the 12-35mm Panasonic lens instead. It is more expensive than the OMD itself, but besides having IS it is relatively fast (f2.8) and seems to be a high quality glass according to the reviews. With this lens I should not miss IBIS of the OMD and would be able to attach an external mic when I feel like shooting video (I use MKE400 for that purpose). When using my primes I would have to be extra careful to minimize the hand shake, but I think I can deal with that.Even though this camera did not work for me, I can see how it can work for other people. In fact, the last push that made me order this camera was the count of downloads I saw on flickr - the OMD got almost 6 times more uploads than the GH2, which made me feel that there must be something special about this camera when taking stills. However, I think this count proves one thing: the OMD is more popular than the GH2 with photographers, and I suspect that the big part of this popularity is how nicely this camera looks and feels, not how much better it works in taking pictures. I can totally understand that, and if the look and feel were the only things that separated these two cameras would probably go with the OMD myself. However, the lack of external mic input, the permanently exposed screen, and the significant price premium makes me feel that the GH2 would work better for me, as well as for those people who want to shoot stills with a MFT sensor camera and lenses and can live with the plastic-y body of the GH2.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quick clear focus!", "Author": "FL", "ReviewID": "R2V02ZS3KL7B3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased Olympus OM-D E-M5 16MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3.0-Inch Tilting OLED Touchscreen [Body Only] (Black) to use with my 14-150mm olympus zoom lens.

I only shoot RAW and process with Lightroom.OM-D EM-5 is a good camera but as I have commented elsewhere, I feel people give it too much credit.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good camera, but calling it a \"great\" camera is a stretch.It is rugged, fast/responsive, with good qualities overall.  However, here is what I don't like about it:- EVF is just ok.- Flash system is mediocre.  So I wonder why it wasn't just built into the body.  Why deliver a flash this mediocre as a separate and bulky accessory?- ISO lowest setting is 200 ISO...why?- Back display is poor.  What is it with MFT cameras that they all have the opaque/darkish/greenish displays?  I find it more difficult to judge sharpness, detail, exposure when looking at the display.- Image quality is good but not great.  When compared to my D600, images are less crisp, less rich...more bland.  Dynamic rage is definitely behind.- The buttons are well laid out, but are small and have a weird feel to them.- Size...it is neither large nor small, which creates a problem (for me).  It is definitely NOT pocketable, yet feels undersized in the hands.- Battery life is poor.- Charger can only be plugged to the electrical outlets via a 5ft cable...what?- Price is definitely high for what it delivers.If I owned this camera only, I would probably be ok with it.  I think my problem with being unsatisfied with the OM-D is in part due to me owning the Nikon D600 (great IQ and price/performance) and the Canon S100 (good IQ in a VERY compact body).  So the OM-D falls awkwardly right in between two other great cameras that are top performers in their own categories.To illustrate with an example, last Friday I had to attend a work gala/dinner event.  I took the S100 which I was able to discretely fit in my suit pocket.  On Saturday I took the family to an arboretum to take our annual fall photographs.  The pick was easy...D600; no hesitation.  I find this pattern repeats more often than not, which leaves the OM-D collecting dust and loosing value.

Compares respectfully to the NEX 7 in iq but not features, although the olympus puts sony to shame with their lens selection and lens quality.The Panasonic LX7 is a dream of camera and the iq and features were very surprising to me. At only 10 mp it produces exceptional pictures, super value for your money.Update:  03/16/2013I purchased a Fujifilm X-E1. I really like this camera. Picture quality and noise are much better than the OMD. It is a still photographers camera, not a sport shooters camera.  The controls and menu system are light years ahead of the OMD. It does not have a bunch of bells and whistles, it does video fairly well, panorama well, no HDR, but has multiple bracket options, although limited to 3 shots. The lens I got was the new 18-55, think old school tank build. The focus is fast - not as fast as the OMD but more accurate. No face detection or tracking, but that is not what this camera is. If you want great pics this is the camera, gimmicks look somewhere else. Raw support is limited but you have never seen jpegs like this before. For me - better than the OMD. Picture quality is much better.

The E-M5 is a disappointment in comparison to the GX1 specifically in that the E-M5 does not focus as fast, as accurately or in as low light as does the GX1. I use touch focus/shutter about ninety per cent of the time. The touch focus on the E-M5 is not as fast, is not as precise in placement and is not as accurate as the GX1. These differences become apparent very quickly. This is a letdown for me. I have the Lumix 14/2.5, the Lumix 12-35/2.8 and the Lumix 35-100/2.8. The focusing issues apply to all these lenses. I do like the E-M5 IBS in comparison to the Lumix OIS. I think the E-M5 has a better sensor with cleaner high ISO images. I really like the dual control wheels on the top plate of the E-M5.

For still image and point and shoot of non moving objects the camera responds and colors average for jpeg. For shooting moving models where you need precise focus of constantly changing positions and natural skin colors this camera fails as cannot focus fast enough especially with the famous 45mm 1.8 lens people say good for portraits. The lens does not focus fast enough but snaps the picture of  gross out of focus subject despite focus square on correct area. It should be smart enough to not snap a way out of focus image in the focus area. You would need a faster focus response camera and lens combination as this camera and lens cannot even be a beginners fashion model photographers camera or moving object picture taking camera. The price is not expensive of course but I find myself having to play with the shooting button getting the right focus before the shutter snaps missing many good moving images. There are no smarts in this camera. The jpeg images are over processed and do not look natural and believe it is due to the sensor overly artificially trying to sharpen the image while it compresses the jpeg. This is true for skin tones as others have noted also.

The problem being that it tends to go in and out of focus so often that I often have to use manual focus.

After a few days with this camera here are my thoughts...If you're looking to buy this camera you are one of a few things:1. very serious about photography2. Have a collection of standard 4/3 lenses and want to upgrade your body (this is me)3. Just have a lot of money to spend.For the first type, if you haven't been into the micro Four/Thirds (m4/3) line you should take a look at all of their available lenses at four-thirds dot org. Now take a look at the standard four/thirds(4/3) line. You may notice there are seemingly much better lenses in the standard line with much better f/stop values. In my opinion the m4/3 lenses don't give the same value as their 4/3 counterparts. Lower quality at similar prices. Olympus has killed their DSLR line and with it any 4/3 lenses. I used to recommend Olympus to anyone looking for a great DSLR camera. I can't recommend them anymore. If you're serious about photography you would be much better off going with Nikon or Canon. At least with them you KNOW that their lines aren't going to be killed off.For the second type... Olympus sells an MMF-x adapter for those who want to carry their 4/3 line onto a m4/3 body. Great news! Wrong. Their is a terrible focus issue when using this adapter and the 4/3 lenses. You can find this on YouTube and on forums throughout the web. I have experienced this first hand. It takes anywhere from 1-3 seconds (I've only had a minimum of 2 sec focus) using auto-focus. This is the case with all but a few select 4/3 lenses. The best and most expensive lenses won't work well. If you're taking photos of anything but still subjects and landscapes this is just not going to work at all. If you happen to be the king of manual focusing this may also work.For the third type... you can find something better to spend your money on. Invest it, donate it, send me an Amazon gift card... any of those would be great.I used to be an extremely avid and dedicated Olympus fan. I was really looking forward to using the new m4/3 bodies. The bodies are really nice and this camera body is nothing short of beautiful. Unfortunately, Olympus can't keep everything right. I have over $1500 worth of 4/3 lenses that there are no equivalent replacements for in the m4/3 line. I guess what I'm trying to say is be very careful what you invest your money into. A grand on a camera body is no joke.To elaborate on my experience with the body...I'm comparing this to my e510, and the E-PL5 (which I bought prior to this one and then returned for this one). I believe the size is the premier reason for buying this camera. It's very small and fits a bit better in your hand than the E-PL5. It's almost as cozy as the bigger e510. The weight of it feels very similar to the larger DSLRs, there doesn't seem to be an advantage here. Though you would perhaps save weight in lenses. I bought the Panasonic 20mm prime lens along with this camera. It performed extremely well. The low light focus performance was great, easily matching my friend's Canon 7D. Although once in a while it would seem to do a full hunt focus where it shouldn't need to. Videos were OK. I felt no distinct advantage over my small Sony cam (with IS). The focus behaved a tad odd for me with the prime lens during video. It doesn't quite match my friend's 7D in that respect. The number of options and abilities to configure everything is just spot on. It would take quite a lot of reading in the owner's manual (PDF) to learn everything you wanted for a full custom configuration.The body is great but unfortunately there is not a good line of lenses to support it. If you are truly looking for a small camera with a good prime lens that you can take around wherever very easily, I would recommend just getting the E-PL5. Despite being a little more awkward to hold it is smaller and I don't think it lacks any in performance, just in configurable options.I hope this review has helped in some way.Note: There are a few decent m4/3 prime lenses but nothing acceptable in the 14-60mm range or upwards to 200mm for me. My subject matter mainly consists of animals and insects (birds, bees, butterflies).

Really tough to press. Granted it IS a smaller camera and that's to be expected but I've had the Sony NEX 5N and the buttons are indeed easier to maneuver.  What I loved about the camera, the picture quality.  Stunning images. However, I think something was wrong with my LCD. It changed colors constantly so I couldn't tell via the LCD if I was getting a good photo or not.  The LCD had a green tint most of the time then change to normal as I was about to shoot. I don't know if that's characteristic of OLED screens. Bizarre.  I bracket shots and there was no way to add Bracketing to one of the FN buttons. Another thing that disappointed me, the camera did not have an HDR mode. My Sony A77 has an automatic HDR setting and blends the photos. It's a life saver but also requires a tripod so the photos are aligned.  One of the bad things about the LCD was when the camera is mounted on a tripod plate, it was difficult to swivel down the LCD without hitting the mounting plate. Doing a manual white balance was also difficult. I got error messages almost 80% of the time. It's a good take along camera if you want to use it in mostly AUTO mode but I like to shoot using different settings.  I really wanted to love this camera. Oh - another thing....night shots. I like taking night shots and do so by bracketing. The 12-50 lens had a lot of flare if there are bright lights near the camera. The camera is known for it's low noise when using high ISO. Yes. It's absolutely true. Very usable up to 3200. It almost seems as though cameras nowadays are not designed by photographers but are aimed mostly toward novices.

I was initially excited.  I loved the small form-factor; I liked the smallish lenses; and the image quality looked good.However, I returned this for the Sony A65 (see my review of that camera), and I couldn't be happier.  Here are the three main reasons:1)  The autofocus on the Olympus is indeed very fast in good light with steady subjects.  However, my old Rebel XTi was better in low light and much better for moving subjects (in any light).  My Sony A65 blows them both away.2)  The EVF on the Olympus made me miss my tiny optical viewfinder on the Rebel XTi.  It doesn't look as good and is a hair too slow to respond when you put it to your eye (you will get frustrated and miss the moment).  The Sony A65's EVF adds many benefits and is optically as pleasing as my brother's Canon 5d Mark III.  The Olympus can't compare.3)  The Olympus is fairly heavy for a small camera and doesn't fit in your pocket, even with a pancake lens.
