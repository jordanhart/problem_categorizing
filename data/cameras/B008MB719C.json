{"Reviews": [{"Title": "PANA keeps improving on the LX3, but still not \"perfect...\"", "Author": "Nathaniel Allen", "ReviewID": "R2HDYWECGLVC9A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wow, this was a tough upgrade decision. Sony's RX100 is superb competition, and I was certain *IT* would be the camera that pulled me out of the Panasonic camp (I also own an old Panasonic DMC-FX50 \"bridge camera\" in addition to an LX5, which replaced my LX3 -- plus my wife kept a Pana FX35 in her purse before she switched to Sony's slim TX9.Despite keeping these few cameras around (really just the 3: the FX50, the TX9 and now the LX7), I'm just your Joe Average photographer, shooting mainly the kids, family/friend gatherings, special events, and some home construction-type projects, and other hobby interests.And what I've ever really wanted out of the LX series is a compact, low light-capable camera with a respectable set of manual controls. Exactly what the SONY RX100 is with its huge sensor, and of the two, it is unquestionably the better performer for indoor shooting situations of fast moving kids, compared to the LX3 and LX5.If that were my only criteria, I'd have never ordered the LX7, and might be typing up my thoughts on the RX100 instead. But maybe my four years of familiarity with the LX3/5 got the better of me. Maybe I'm just a sheep with a Panasonic logo branded on my flank. But there were a couple of sore points with the Sony that just plain made me unsatisfied. Rather than trash the RX100 (not my intention), here's my list: - There's no escaping the benefit of the wide 24mm lens on the LX series. Not to mention the handy aspect ratio mode switching right on the bezel. And I use the 1:1 aspect ratio more than I care to admit. - The Panasonic's hot shoe is a hot commodity when I need it. I have a Metz 36-AF4O (since replaced by the Metz 36 AF-5, I believe) which is about as big as the camera itself, but provides more than adequate light with bounce capabilities. - Two of my gripes with the LX3 and LX5 were the difficulty of adjusting manual settings via push-button & thumb dial inputs. The LX7's aperture ring and dedicated manual focus lever have addressed this, with varying degrees of satisfaction. - I get to keep my LX5 spare battery, which isn't such a huge deal, but just know that its shelf life is spectacular. Although my predicted number of shots between charges has decreased, per the manual. Nothing drastic; still great battery life. - Most importantly, the Panasonic LX7 has a certain ease and quickness about it -- probably due in part to my use of its predecessors -- and combined with the newly added manual controls, it feels to me the design is finally at a point where I can set up various shooting solutions with a minimum of fuss and button pressing, nearly (but not quite) like my SLR days many years ago. The \"user experience\" of the Sony, by comparison, felt a little too menu driven and sticky.Where did Panasonic fall short with this new model? - For one, the image quality really hasn't changed. My thoughts are that the LX3 was excellent, but the LX5 tended to focus a little soft -- although nothing that stood out horribly amiss; maybe within the normal manufacturing variations? I don't want to speculate on sensor sizes or type playing a role, but I can attest Sony's RX100 shoots a \"cleaner\" or \"crisper\" portrait-style photo -- although that difference disappears once the image is downsized for printing/sharing. - There's still no remote. Or cable release. Or Bulb mode. Can't tell you how much I enjoy those features on other cameras. For the LX5, I have a cable release adapter that slides into the hot shoe and extends an arm over the shutter release for a cable release to activate, but the hot shoe has been realigned on the LX7 so it no longer works. - I continue to have trouble reading the silver-on-silver symbols etched onto the 4-way keys. - If you're one to complain about the lens cap (I'm not, but I know a lot of LX users HATE the thing)... well, it's still here, and it's smaller than before, making it a little more difficult to clip on/clip off. - I once committed to never buying a camera without a tiltable display, but that's just not an option. All things considered, the LX7 display is not as bright at the RX100, but is very visible in all but direct daylight, and viewable from off angles without the colors inverting.What did Panasonic get right with the LX7 update? - The redesigned lens is noteworthy. It's a definite improvement over the LX5 for indoor shooting, and that extends through the entire zoom range (still only 90mm, which was an improvement over the LX3). I find that I take the vast majority of my photos on the wide end of this lens, but in low light settings, I've been forced to if I'm trying to avoid using the flash. With the lens redesign, I've got a little more flexibility in my zoom before resorting to higher ISOs. - IC? Firmware? Who knows! The camera is snappier than its predecessor, in all aspects: start up, menu navigation, auto focus delay, and shot to shot. It gets shots off near instantaneously. And the kicker is a burst mode! - I can't say I was disappointed by the 720p video of the LX5, but full HD video is a treat -- especially with memory prices as cheap as they are compared to two years ago. - Finally, a dedicated white balance button on the 4-way controller! (Panasonic eliminated the \"Focus\" key featured on the LX5, and also added burst mode selection to the shutter self timer key.) - I'm very excited about the inclusion of a time lapse feature. This was overdue. - The clickable, dedicated aperture ring, especially, and the manual focus lever, sort of (light applause -- needs something more \"ring like\") - The mode wheel is substantially firmer, preventing inadvertent turns while in the pocket.Some random thoughts on the Sony RX100: It feels a little \"rough\" at startup (i.e. not-so-smooth lens extension, kind of rough feel & sound), and starts up about a second slower than the Panasonic, but not having to remove a lens cap negates that. Zoom time from full wide to full tele is about one second snappier on the Sony. I felt that the Sony's auto white balance \"got it right\" more often than the LX, but the custom white balance is at minimum one level deep into the menu (if set to the Fn key). Shutdown immediately after snapping a pic is an agonizingly slow 5-6 seconds for full lens retraction; 3-4 seconds if the camera is already at idle. And not so much a dig at Sony as a kudos to Panasonic, but with the 28mm constraint on the wide end, switching from 4:3 to 16:9 simply crops the top and bottom of the frame, whereas on all the LX cameras with their unique sensor usage, I actually gain extra pixels on the sensor to help compose the shot I want.Panasonic's history of product support HAS to be a consideration. They released mid-cycle firmware updates for both the LX3 and the LX5, and with the unexpected LX3 update in particular, added new features -- not just bug fixes. (Wish I could say the same about the FX50, but that's a story for another day...)I wouldn't be so bold as to recommend the LX7 over the RX100, but only want to give a little insight via some of the features I hold in high regard. They both definitely have their strong suits. If you're at all familiar with the previous LX cameras, you have a solid basis for understanding the LX7 improvements, as well as its shortcomings. That certainly didn't stop me from happily purchasing the RX100 before giving the LX7 a chance to hit the streets, but by doing so I immediately proved to myself that there is still no \"perfect camera,\" and with the compromises that I had to accept, my preferences fell mainly back to the LX line.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best compact camera for the price", "Author": "Bob \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "RR3H02BOW2JLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I feel bad for this camera because it got overshadowed by the Sony RX100, which everyone thinks is so amazing because it has a sensor that's midway in size between a compact camera and an APS-C DSLR.Leaving aside the RX100, the LX7 is the best compact camera I have ever owned with respect to image quality and useability and features.Some of the wonderful attributes of this camera are:1. It focuses as fast as an entry-level DSLR.2. Built-in level.3. \"Step-zoom\" allows you to select focal-length-equivalents of 24, 28, 35, 50, 70 and 90mm.4. Manual focus gives you an electronic depth of field chart which changes as you change the aperture. This makes it great for either zone focusing or for finding the hyperfocal distance. There's also an \"MF Resume\" option which will return the lens to where you last manually focused.5. Lens is really sharp, only minimal corner softness at F4, and very useable wide open, more so than the Sony RX100.6. I also see nearly zero purple fringing with this camera--I'm not sure if its the amazing lens or Panasonic post-processing tricks, but it's nevertheless impressive.7. Lens is so fast that this camera is actually a BETTER low-light camera than any entry-level DSLR if you are only going to be using that DSLR with the kit lens. The lens is also faster than the RX100, so you need to take that into account when you compare the two cameras. The lens is fast enough to give you a little bit of blurred background, something I've never seen before on a compact camera.8. Widest angle is 24mm (equivalent), which is a premium feature that you don't get on basic DSLR kit lenses and you don't get on the Sony RX100.9. For a sensor if its size it's probably best-of-class, with better DR and less noise than sensors from a few years ago.The negatives of this camera are:1. Not as small as a Sony RX100. It is not a pants pocket camera, but fits fine in a coat pocket. The LX7 is slightly more pocketable than an Olympus E-PM1 with the Panasonic 14mm pancake lens.2. The LCD is nice, but not as nice as the one on the Sony RX100.3. Has a lens cap you need to remove before using the camera. The camera comes with a little cord you can use to attach the lens cap to the camera so you don't lose it, but I tried it and hated having a lens cap dangling around. So far I've only lost one lens cap in the last ten years, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.4. Even at base ISO, the sensor is a good distance behind top-quality larger sensors, like the one in the Nikon 3200, so if your photographic goal is to make really huge prints, I recommend a Nikon 3200 with a sharp lens like the Nikon 16-85mm DX VR lens. But you would probably not notice this sensor's shortcomings in anything smaller than a 13 x 19\" print.Bottom line:If you are going to buy an entry-level DSLR or micro-four-thirds or NEX camera, and are only going to use that camera with the kit lens, then you are probably better off buying an LX7 instead. This camera even has a flash shoe and can be used with a real flash, so there's nothing you can't do with this camera just as well or better that you can do with a DSLR+kit lens.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best hiking/climbing camera ever", "Author": "Monty VanderBilt \"Hiking and mapping the Midd...", "ReviewID": "R8Y74KD2WXEE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My primary requirement for a camera is that it be compact, but still take great pictures under the conditions I run into often. I hike and climb a lot and do not want the bulk of a DSLR hanging in front of me, and the camera must be accessible so I don't delay the group while digging my camera out of the pack. So I gravitate toward the compact camera that gives me as much of the DLSR feature set as possible.I chose the LX7 primarily because it has a very fast lens. For me that means handheld shots under a thick forest canopy are not blurred because of slow shutter speeds. My previous camera was the DMC-LX5, the predecessor to this model and it was great. I'm replacing it because I made the mistake of taking movies in a sandstorm during a hike down Buckskin gulch in Utah. Ever since that the camera has been complaining when sand grains stick in the lens mechanism and get inside the camera on the sensor. So don't do that!When the LX7 arrived I downloaded the PDF manual (much easier to read than the small one in the box) and went through the new features to familiarize myself with how to use them. I kept being delighted with the improvements over the LX5 that make this the best camera I've ever owned for hiking/climbing shots. In brief, they are:1) Fast lens - good for hand held shots in dim lighting situations (forests, twilight, ...). You don't hold up your companions setting up a tripod shot.2) Wide angle - no need for a panorama when the wide angle lens can get it all3) Compact - light and small enough to hand around your neck all day without being uncomfortable4) Raw - Most of the time I take jpeg simply to document the hike. But when dramatic lighting or scenes call for it I can kick in the Raw for a killer result.5) Bracketing - many outdoor shots with snow or sun/shadow scenes have huge contrast. Exposure bracketed shots combined in post solve this.6) New! Auto HDR - LX7 will do the bracketing and merging in camera. Haven't tested enough to see if it beats (4) for quality though.7) New! Auto Pano - I take a lot of panorama shots from viewpoints, and it's time consuming to stitch them in post. The LX7 will do them in camera.8) New! 3D - I know, 3D is overrated, but for that shot hanging over the cliff nothing else works as well. LX7 has a 3D photo mode.9) New! Time Lapse - I don't do time lapse much because I couldn't, but I hope to capture progressive alpenglow from camp, and a time lapse of 3 shots 1-minute apart also works as a long self-timer. I've nearly fallen scrambling on steep summit rocks to get in the picture withing 10 seconds.10) White body - I bushwhack a lot and twice my camera has \"sneaked\" out of my case when I forgot to close the zipper. White cameras are easier to find!", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Panasonic DMC-LX7: Best in Class!", "Author": "Randy Wakeman \"Randy Wakeman\"", "ReviewID": "RRHPFX44IUYY4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic DMC-LX7: Its Own Class of CameraThe notion of compact and \"pocketable\" form factor cameras is a matter of perspective. Just like an \"affordable\" camera has a lot to do with what you personally feel is an appropriate price bracket, if a camera is pocketable or not depends on how big your pockets are. The Lumix LX7 retails for about $500, is one of the flagship fixed lens cameras from Panasonic, yet has already been discounted in various spots to forty percent less than retail. At $300 street price, it is less dollars than some small-sensor long zoom cameras, yet is still about double the price of some very competent point and shoot cameras. If you are interested in optional (but pricey) features, the hot shoe of the LX-7 lets you instantly add the Panasonic DMW-LVF2 1,440,000-dot equivalent electronic viewfinder (about $200) or your choice of a few external flash units as well.The LX-7 is the latest incarnation of the LX-3 / LX-5 series of more or less compact cameras that have featured a bit larger sensors and brighter lenses than the run of the mill compact cameras, along with the ability to save images in RAW format. Compared to its well-received predecessor, the LX-5 has a sharper 3-inch LCD with 920,000 dots, a faster F1.4-2.3, 3.8X lens, faster shooting performance, and comparatively spectacular video capability. It records at up to Full HD video at 1080/60p and additionally offers high speed 720p video recording at 120 frames/second. Compared to the LX-5 this is a substantial upgrade, as far as I'm concerned, in most all key areas. Its CIPA standard battery life is reduced to 330 images from 400 in the LX-5, likely due to its improved resolution LCD. It is a bit heavy (0.66 lb / 10.51 oz.) and bulky (4.37 x 2.68 x 1.81 in.) compared to the shirt pocket type cameras, but similar to the LX5. It does fits the platform of pocket camera, but a coat-pocket camera rather than a shirt or pants pocket camera.LX7 Basic SpecificationsResolution: 10.10 MegapixelsLens: 3.80x zoom (24-90mm eq.)Viewfinder: LCD 920kLCD Size: 3.0 inchISO: 80-12800Shutter: 250-1/4000Max Aperture: 1.4Dimensions: 4.4 x 2.6 x 1.8 in. (111 x 67 x 46 mm)Weight: 10.5 oz (297 g) incl. batteryMSRP: $500100% crop image quality at ISO 1600 betters the upscale long zoom cameras, such as the generally impressive DMC-FZ200. Its faster lens and slightly larger sensor (1/1.7 inch) combine to make this came a low-light superstar, bettering the similar sensor size equipped Canon S100 and S110.Let's say you are considering moving up to the LX7 from a compact long zoom travel camera, such my current favorite in that class, the Lumix ZS-15 or the generally excellent Canon SX260. Now, you net the sharper LCD, a bigger sensor, and the LX7 lens is far, far faster than the ZS-15's F3.3 - F5.9 array. You'll also appreciate the included external charger, the hot shoe of the LX-7, and the obvious superior low-light capabilities. By low light, I mean the indoors version of low-light, without using the flash. If you accustomed to post-processing, the RAW images of the LX7 will be another appreciated advantage.On the flipside, the LX-7 is around twice the price, you might miss the 16x optical zoom, and you'll notice right away that the LX-7 is noticeably bigger and heavier by comparison. You'll also notice right away that there is no integral lens cover on the LX7 and the lens cap is removed manually (an aftermarket solution is readily available). If your focus (pun int.) is primarily on convenience and economy, the ZS-15 is most assuredly easier to have with you all the time, easier to quickly just throw into a pocket and go.The reasons there is so little consensus in the preferred camera is that we all have divergent notions of what a camera is supposed to do. Naturally, image quality defines a desirable camera, but there is the snapshot level of quality image and then the \"I want to make posters\" level. Satisfying snapshots are the most common output of a camera to no one's great surprise. Yet, if your camera has wondrous image quality, but turtle-slow shooting performance, it is easy to forego image softness only discernible if you hold an 8 x 10 a few inches from your nose in favor of a faster camera that is less hassle to use.Video capabilities get better and better in \"still cameras,\" one of those things not important to you . . .  unless of course it is. This camera delivers strongly in the video department. The same goes with time lapse, high-speed video, creative effects, and so forth. The technically \"best\" image-capturing unit may not at all be the best choice for you if the image stabilization is poor, you can't see the LCD, the batteries are perpetually dead, and some of the specialty features you really want don't exist. In all of these areas, the LX-7 is either very good to class-leading.The LX-7 aspect ratio selector means you can shoot 3:2 images at 9.5 Megapixels. That completely fills the 3:2 aspect ratio screen and is where I've found myself doing most of my shooting. The image stabilization is excellent, the Panasonic \"iA\" (intelligent auto mode) yields impressive results if you aren't inclined to experiment with the program or scene modes.CONCLUSIONThis camera reads like a compilation of everything most people claim they want improved from their economy, compact, point and shoot. It has a better LCD, a bigger sensor, first-rate video capabilities, a hot shoe, JPEG, JPEG+RAW, and RAW capability, and includes the fastest lens in this category of camera today: F1.4-2.3. It includes an external charger as opposed to \"USB only\" charging, its 330 CIPA battery life is better than most compacts, and it has enough manual controls and scene modes to keep people experimenting for a very, very long time. This unit captures truly excellent video with a wondrous high speed video mode as well, 720p @ 120 fps.Time lapse, high speed video, an external charger, and a built-in neutral density filter might seem old hat by now, but it actually is ***anything but***. The next step up the food chain, the larger sensored $650 Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-RX100 lacks not just one or two of these features: it lacks all of them. Yet, the RX100 is lighter in weight, if not on the wallet, something than cannot be said for some others in the category. The RX100 actually offers very little over this camera, its diminutive size and higher resolution are the two areas that cannot be denied. What closes the gap is the extremely fast lens of the LX-7.It is hard to fault this camera. In many ways, this is a one-stop compact personal imaging center for both still images and video. The only video consideration is not the video quality, but the inability to plug in an external mic. The only thing you might miss as a still camera is the lack of a long optical zoom if you feel that cramps your personal creative juices. The overall speedy focus and shooting performance is immensely satisfying; as you won't find yourself waiting for this camera to respond. If there is such thing as a bullseye in the price / performance ratio, this camera seems to nail it.In somewhat of rare and pleasant happenstance, this camera does everything it promises to do. Not everything always works as described, but the Panasonic DMC-LX7 actually does. Those looking to upgrade from the LX5 won't have to go past the faster lens, sharper LCD, and vastly improved video to find the LX7 an appealing successor. This is simply an all-around excellent piece of equipment.It scores top-of-chart in image quality and video quality in its class. Its shooting performance makes many cameras seem turtle-slow shot-to-shot. Finally, can be considered a screamingly strong value as well. Nothing competes with it at a $300 street price that I'm aware of and I mean ***nothing***. For many, many folks this is the only camera you'll need or want . . . and it leaves scant little lacking in a non-system reasonably compact package beyond what comes in the box.I did add Progo DMW-BCJ13e Power Pack (Two Li-Ion Rechargeable Batteries and Pocket Travel AC/DC Wall Charger with Car Adapter & US to European plug) for Panasonic DMW-BCJ13, DMW-BCJ13E, DMW-BCJ13PP. Works with Lumix DMC-LX5, DMC-LX7 Digital Camera. Fully Compati... that is really quite a bargain in battery-land, and a Lowepro Rezo 50 Camera Bag. The Lowepro Rezo 50 works particularly well if you go with a standard lanyard on the side of the camera rather than the dual strap supplied array. My final addition was the Auto Lens Cap for PANASONIC LUMIX DMC LX7 LX-7, LEICA D-LUX 6 + MagicFiber Microfiber Lens Cleaning Cloth.The Progo batteries are excellent, no loss of functionality vs. OEM batteries, slightly better life, and a fraction of the rip-off priced Panasonic branded batteries. With the Auto lens cap, everything goes neatly into the Rezo 50 bag including the two extra batteries. This is where it reaches, but does not exceed, my own personal limit of an easily portable camera array.Copyright 2012 by Randy Wakeman. All Rights Reserved.If you are on a budget, and want a better than standard compact camera that is a bit smaller, consider: Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) for $249. Poor video compared to the LX7, a slower lens, weak low-light ability, but significantly smaller in size.For longer zoom, economical compacts the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS15 12.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom (Black) is a screaming deal at $149 and the Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black) is now (finally) at a competitive $200 price point.If you want a RAW capable long zoom fixed lens camera, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black is a top choice, but still at a salty $500 price point, and it is too bulky to be considered compact by most.For image quality, though, this LX-7 betters them all, and in low light or for video, it makes them all looks embarrassingly weak.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "The LX7 is great", "Author": "S. Vogt", "ReviewID": "RBD7F5NIMXI76", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated 2/22/13 to revise comments on image qualityTook this camera out on a trail yesterday with me. Overall, I think it's a solid performer and better than its predecessor for the most part.The camera feels a little cheaper than than the LX5. It's not flimsy, but it seems like the body is composed of plastic vs. metal on the LX5. It doesn't feel as solid as the S100, but it doesn't feel flimsy though. The button layout on the back of the camera is almost exactly the same as the LX5. Including the silver buttons whose labeling is hard to see. But that is just a minor annoyance overall.The screen is a definite improvement over its predecessors, sharp and crisp and much more usable in direct sunlight, and it also seems larger. Composing a shot with this camera is a much more pleasant experience overall than the LX5.The aperture ring on the front of the camera has a nice feel to it when adjusting the aperture. However, I would have rather seen Panasonic put in a customizable ring like on the Canon S100 rather than just for adjusting the aperture. But there was nothing of the sort on its predecessor so it still is nice to have the aperture ring there.The firmware on the camera is a lot faster than its predecessor. The write times have improved (I am using a Class 10 SanDisk card) but you still want to get a decent memory card for this camera so you won't get slowed down by the write times. The camera has a fairly decent menu system in order to access different features. The Panorama mode works very well and dare I say, even better than Sony's implementation. However, unlike Sony who puts it on the mode dial on a lot of its cameras, you have to go into the scene mode first and then select the option from there.Image quality is really top-shelf for a compact camera. This has a lot to do with the sharpness and color performance of the lens. Depending on how you view things, there is a chance you might actually like the photos from the LX7 better than the RX100 due to its excellent color performance. Colors are vibrant and saturated but not to the point where they look cartoonish and overdone. Color accuracy is also excellent. It is not the high ISO king but processing RAW will help you get usable files as high as ISO1600. The JPEG files are an improvement over the LX5 and the RAW files are simply stunning and compare quite nicely (at low ISOs) to APS-C cameras. Very pleased with the images from this camera.Another strong suit for this camera is autofocus performance. It is the fastest enthusiast compact I have ever shot with in that regard no matter what the lighting conditions are. However, like its predecessors, the lens zooms VERY slowly. It's a shame that Panasonic did not do anything to speed that up in this model.I have not messed with the movie mode but from what I see it does a pretty good job. Honestly, I don't do much movie recording so I don't really have much to say on the performance.I think the LX7 is a great little camera. Image quality is excellent, especially considering the sensor size. The AF performance is also very quick. There are some operational annoyances, but overall, this camera is a good choice and has been very reasonably priced as of late.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Leica and Panasonic finally got it right, but buy the EVF too!", "Author": "techwriter1", "ReviewID": "R31FIDQA2HA50J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LX7 was an upgrade from my Leica D-Lux 4 (Lumix LX3). The LX7 is identical in function to the Leica D-Lux 6 in glass, sensor and overall function, has a nice built-in grip - the Leica does not, and there are only slight differences in menu user interface. The Leica will appeal to those who want to pay double or more for the name and little red dot, but there is no technical justification.  Same camera. So the rest of this review is about the Lumix LX-7.Lumix got this so exactly right, on a camera that has seen gentle evolutionary changes previously.First of all, don't be bamboozled by pixel count.  Although it is billed as 10MP, those are fat sensitive pixels on a large sensor area (1:1.7).  They also evolved from a CCD to a richer, more sensitive CMOS sensor, as many manufacturers have done over the years. The picture quality is superb, even in very low light, and up to about ISO 1600.  Shot at ISO 80-200, the resulting JPEGs are grainless up to 8x10 magnification, and will make a fine 16x20 uncropped. It seems folks are selling cameras with huge MP specs and teeny sensors these days; just so much marketing vaporware. This one makes no such nonsensical lie.I can this a Leica-Sonic, because, make no mistake, Leica did profoundly influence the lens design.  It's not that disingenuous to call it a Vario-Summilux; Summilux is Leica branding for their f1.4 lenses costing many thousands of dollars when made in Germany for the M-Series cameras, and this is a true f1.4 lens at 24mm equivalent. At the 90mm equivalent end of the range, it's still f2.3.  Couple that with excellent anti-shake, and you have a discrete digicam for wideangle, normal and macro use which can shoot hand-held in near zero light at a half-second. It is not for telephoto-lovers, the 20x zoom cameras have more reach but nowhere near this image quality. But at the 24mm end, very little barrel distortion, sharp out to the corners, and you can focus in macro mode objects which nearly touch the lens!Some unique features which no one else offers:(1) The f1.4 lens.  Are you kidding me?  They are not.  Go find it anywhere else, except on your fixed focal length prime lens for the DSLR. It not only allows extreme low light shooting, but even lets you create shallow depth-of field for close portraits, which no other digicams can.  And if you want to do this in bright light, where the 1/4000 sec fastest shutter and ISO 80 would otherwise not allow you to use the f1.4 max aperture, it even has a built-in neutral density filter with a dedicated button, so you can still shoot wide open. Extraordinary lens.  Okay, so maybe Ernst Leitz would turn over in the casket if he ever saw the Summilux name applied to a Japanese-manufactured lens on a pocket camera, but it's a fantastic lens.(2) The variable aspect ratio switch - you can shoot 3:2 like traditional 35mm, 4:3 like an iPad, 16:9 if you know you are going to view on a widescreen monitor or TV, and - new for this version - even 1:1.  All those crops come out of an oversized 12MP circular image sensor, so you can crop before you shoot, not after, and maintain far more image detail. At the flip of a switch just above the lens.(3) The manual controls are extensive and well placed.  You can certainly shoot in iA (intelligent auto) and be hard-pressed to screw up anything, or control everything. But for manual shooters, at least use P, so that you can override white balance, focus or aperture when needed. And the manual focus mode and metering mode controls are excellent. Any time you use A or M, or override the P setting with a well-placed multi-control dial, you see the resulting aperture/shutter speed pairings instantly.(4) It has an aperture ring!! - While most digicams have only an f4-f8 aperture range, making manual control of aperture and shutter almost useless, this f1.4 lens has a manual aperture ring from f1.4 to f8 right on the lens barrel, so you can shoot in A mode like it was a traditional SLR. Even most modern DSLR lenses don't have one anymore.  That is a priceless feature for aperture priority shooters.(5) Exposure compensation.  Any serious pro camera has a bias dial, the +/- exposure control that lets you bias the auto exposure up or down in 1-stop or partial stop increments.  Go find it on an iPhone, nope.  Go find it on most prosumer digicams; it is often buried in menus.  But on the Lumix LX7, the multi-control ring lets you change it instantly, while the display shows you the plus/minus bias and and resulting aperture/shutter speed pairings, either on screen or in the viewfinder.No camera's meter is smart enough to correctly expose every shot without exposure bias. I use this feature with nearly every picture I take, on every camera I use.  I even use it on my Pantech Discover cell phone (sorry, Apple). But on the Lumix, it is utterly convenient and professional, an indispensable tool.(6) The mode dial was stiffened up over earlier versions; it will no longer move by itself in the pocket or case. And when you change it, a spinning dial on the display easily shows you the set mode (iA, A, P, M, etc) in BIG letters, so you know the mode set without removing eyes from the screen or finder.(7) Did I say \"finder\"?  I am a 56-year old eyeglass wearer who grew up on pro Nikons with great optical viewfinders.  While I loved my previous Leica-Sonic (the f2 lensed LX3 / D-Lux 4) for image quality and portability, I could not use it at arms length without the eyeglasses on and off like a yo-yo.  So candid and action shots were nearly impossible, just like most arm's length digicams.  So I never replaced my Nikon's normal lens or considered the Leica D-Lux 4 a true alternative. And after shooting, in bright light you couldn't see or edit what you shot, unless you hid inside someplace dark (same problem with DSLRs).Enter the new Leica-Sonic (Lumix LX7) with the LVF2 viewfinder. The finder, made by Olympus but marketed for Leica (EVF) and Lumix (LVF), slides into the shoe, and transforms this little digicam into a near DSLR, in some ways better. It's bright, contrasty, shows you the accurate framing, focus and exposure and all settings - everything you can see on the 3\" rear LCD.  Or not.  Flip back and forth between finder and screen with a button. Switch on and off the extra finder info with a button. Then review your just-shot picture in the finder as well. Not even my Nikons let me do this, so when you simply must verify exposure, focus or anything else outdoors, the EVF is transformative for photography. Yes, it does create some bulk, but as a tool, it is the single biggest advance in small cameras since we did away with film. Buying this accessory is essential, even if you have to carry it in a separate pocket.(8) Framing. My Nikons and previous Leica-Sonic had an electronic grid you could overlay on the screen when you needed to line up composition, like the lines on a large-format camera's ground glass.  It was too busy and distracting on a small screen. So this time around, Lumix replaced it with a live 'gyro', a horizon line and vertical line which move to help you keep the camera level while shooting, without getting in the way.  As with all the other display features, it is easily turned off and on with a button.(9) Frame Rate. I thought I had died and gone upstairs when I learned how to trick my Nikon D300 into shooting nine frames per second (fps) instead of the advertised six. It has allowed me to capture instants in time otherwise impossible. Anyone not trying out this feature is missing out on capturing something really spectacular; I've taught several students to capture sports action like pros by using high frame rate. Well, this Lumix LX7 shoots ELEVEN fps. Sorry Nikon, but the little mirror-less camera has you beat here. And with a class 10 SD card installed, it will keep up, even at full resolution.  Wow.Nitpick 1:  I've read many reviews panning this camera because it does not have a retractable lens cover. Rather, it has a traditional cap which you manually remove and replace, just like on a real camera, and it attaches with a small string tether to the strap lug so you don't lose it while shooting.  My response is \"Bee-Eff-Dee\". I have to uncap my Nikons to shoot them, and since their lenses interchange, the cap goes in my case or pocket while shooting.  With the Lumix, at least you always know where the cap is.  Let's face it; this is not a toy, it is a serious photographer's small camera (I will not call it a point-and-shoot, out of respect).  So if you want a retractable lens cover, go get a toy camera.  Else, deal with it.Nitpick2: Panasonic markets this as having a 7.5x Intelligent Zoom.  Please do not insult MY intelligence. This is a 3.8x OPTICAL zoom lens, a 24-90mm equivalent in 35mm film parlance. The fact that you can crop in from that by 'zooming' past the optical limits has little practical value.  By now, most digicam buyers get that, so Panasonic is attempting to rebrand digital zoom as something more than digital in-camera crop. But it is not a 7.5x lens, and the product title should not feature than number.  It cheapens an otherwise excellent product aimed at the prosumer market, not the K-Market.Nitpick3: Ken Rockwell, who has authored many fine camera reviews, has routinely panned this Leica / Lumix camera series. In his words, \"it's not a real Leica\".  Well, no kidding, Ken. It also does not cost ten thousands bucks, body alone, plus lenses at several thousand per.  But for most ordinary humans wanting professional image quality and features without a mortgage, it is all the Leica we will ever need.  And for me, I can ski with it at 50mph in my pocket, ride my bike with it in my saddle bag, and always have it handy.  I don't know anyone who would treat a Leica M9 this way.  Most of them sit locked behind glass display cabinets.  Mine makes photos.Bottom line:  I still keep my Nikon's 50mm f1.4 lens for fine portraiture and product photography, and to keep at least one mid-range lens for the D300. But I recently sold my Nikon's ten-year-old massive 28-70mm f2.8 pro lens, for $900, once I bought the Lumix). Why?  Because the LX7 obsoleted the Nikkor. The LX7 cost me far less in total with viewfinder, spare battery, cards, EVF, leather half-case and leather wrist strap than I sold the well-used Nikkor lens for. And because it is far more versatile and pocketable, it takes more and better pictures.All I use the Nikon D300 now for is for ultrawide (the 16mm fisheye and 12-24mm lenses) and telephoto (the 70-210mm f2.8) shooting. For everything else, the LX7 with the EVF is now this professional photographer's primary camera.Just don't call it a point-and-shoot. You will insult it.Bob Reed / Alpine Images", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "And Lumix said, \"Let there be light!\"", "Author": "Charles W.

I am not a professional. I'm just a guy who likes to take pictures of my family and the things I see on the occasional trip. Of course, it's better if the pictures look like they have been taken by a professional with a big professional camera. I have owned a Lumix DMC-LC5, which was nice and gave me a few of those, but had the limitations of an early generation digital camera, and a Lumix DMC FZ-20 which  was a significant improvement and gave me even more of the professional quality pictures I love, but it still had limitations, especially in poorly lit situations like indoor shots. I'm getting ready to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip out of the country and I wanted a special camera to make it easy and convenient to take great pictures and I didn't want to lug my bulky FZ-20 around, either. I bought my DMC-LX7 because of the promise of much better low light shots so the first thing I did when I got it was take some pictures inside the house at night without a flash. I was amazed. I may never use a flash again! It is almost like this lens creates its own light. Almost as good as the human eye. Just for grins, I turned out the lights and popped on a flash pointed to the ceiling and fired off a few shots. The results were eye-popping. The whole room was flooded with light that was evenly dispersed and natural. Probably the best shot I have ever taken of the room. Outside at night I got some fabulous shots of lit up houses and door-fronts. The daylight pictures were equally impressive as well. The automatic and creative settings really produce exceptional results. I may never have to try to figure out the finer points of manipulating ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed again. Yes, the camera is smaller than I expected, but I don't see that as a negative. It fits easily in my hand and, yes, I can one-hand it and I'm not a big guy. It is heavy for its size, but I don't see that as a negative. It feels solid and serious, not like a toy. You do have to take the lens cover off to do anything and it is small, but the handy little lens cap strap hooks nicely to the same metal loop for the neck strap. You'd have to be a real klutz to lose it or to not figure out how to attach it. If you are looking for a great little camera that takes great low light (and bright light pictures as well) this is it.

When this one was announced, I could not wait to try it. The F1.4 - F2.3 lens was the only draw for me, so that is what I focused on when I received the camera.The good things are:Great resolution for such a small sensor. The noise behavior is good up to about 400iso and manageable if you have to use 800 (better by about a stop, than the LX5 IMO). The speed of operation is great, locking focus quickly and shot to shot times are much better than nearly any other P&S; out there. The screen is lovely, and you can reasonably see it in bright sun (at least enough to compose a shot). It has a distinctly better fit in my hand than the LX3/5, feeling more like you can keep hold of it. The aperture ring on the lens is great, nicely clicking into position and felling like the detents are of a quality that high end DSLR's would use/employ.The bad thing is:The lens. Yes, it is a Leica branded lens, and yes it is a faster aperture. However, that F1.4 - 2.3 are deceptive since to get the legendary sharpness from either end of this lens, you have to stop down at least one full stop. Not as sharp wide open as the LX5 I am afraid. Next, the thing seems to rear focus on all Macro shots where distance to subject is sub 6\". I tried about 20 or 30 shots to have this work as this one feature is what Panny have done so well in the LX series so far. Every shot in that range, rear focuses. If you imagine a shot of a ring, where you are 2\" from the  ring to lens, then focus on the stone in the front area of the ring, it would consistently hit about half way through that circle of the ring before getting sharp.I loved the camera and really wanted to keep it. Alas, I cannot do so when I know that is one thing that would limit my shooting with it, and the softer images wide open would end up frustrating me. I have returned it.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great secondary camera for the DSLR user", "Author": "Mike Vande Ven Jr.", "ReviewID": "R32FHJLRR410WR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a strictly DSLR user for years. But recently I found that I had a need for a compact camera, when taking the DSLR wasn't appropriate. I needed something I could fit in a pocket and it had to take RAW images. From there I was spec comparing, and it really came down to price. With the 299 price tag during Cyber Monday, this was the winner.This is the first Panasonic camera I have ever owned (I do have a panasonic video recorder with some similar menu titles) so it took me a while to get used to the layout. I'm not a big fan of jumping into on screen menus to makes changes, as I feel it's much slower than using the mini LCD on top of most DSLRs. So I'm very glad for the aperture ring (I do 95% of my shooting in aperture priority). I'm also very glad for the wheel that allows me to change my exposure compensation. However, the Quick Menu could use some work, as I don't find it quick enough.I also like the button layout choices.  My left hand is basically free to make aperture and focus changes, while my right hand does the rest. The text on the buttons is hard to read, but the positions feel natural as I was able to quickly memorize them. I think it's GREAT that the movie recording button is recessed, making it almost impossible to accidentally press.The size and weight f the camera is also respectable. I can easily fit it in a jacket pocket, and depending on the pants I am wearing, a pants pocket. The camera feels dense and sturdy overall, expect for some of the top buttons which I'm afraid could be bumped off. Of note, I have very large hands, and this camera feels very comfortable in them. There is enough space between each button that allows me to press them without hitting others.Now that the physical aspects of the camera are out of the way, how does it perform? Starting with the autofocus, which is lighting fast. I recommend setting the autofocus box size as small as possible. This helps ensure that the point you want focused is in focus. The focus tracking feature is pretty handy, especially for kids and pets.The inboard flash isn't any good, just like all built in flashes I have ever used. But the inclusion of a hotshot is fantastic. I can throw on one of my manual flashes that allows me to bounce the flash around and also use my wireless triggers. I did notice that there are very few panasonic compatible TTL flashes, which is a concern if you are not comfortable setting flash strength manually.Quality of photos is outstanding for a compact. I shot in a number of different lighting situations, and was very impressed at the results. Sure my DSLR takes higher quality photos, especially in tricky light, but I would expect nothing else. I did notice a slight bit of chromatic aberration in some high contrast areas, and the auto white balance is a bit towards cool/green, but those thinks are easily fixed in post when using RAW. and surprisingly, when the sun is in the frame, I like the burst created by this a bit better than from the DSLR.I find the image stabilization to work very well. I can keep the ISO low but continue to get decent photos. Nothing compares to using a tripod, but at least this gives me usable images in low light.One thing that is a big annoying is the write speed of images. Auto focus is fast, menus are fast, shutter lag is short, frames per second is high, and the LCD is very responsive. But writing images to the card is annoyingly slow (I'm using a fast card). The main downside here is that you cannot view images while the buffer is clearing, and you cannot fully power off until the buffer is clear.Some minor additions to the review:* I would prefer to not have a neck strap, and just a wrist strap. A neck strap just isn't needed for a compact.* You need to remove the battery to charge it. It seems to be able to keep the time, I just hope there isn't some hard to replace mini battery that will die in a few years. It would be great if it could charge via the USB port.* The ND filter is a nice touch. Combine that with a physical ND filter and you could get some very long exposures during the day.* The included software (as least for the Mac) is crap. Don't bother with it.* There is an included strap to connect the lens cap to the camera. I almost threw it away because it was packed strangely.* I cannot understand why the main menu has so many pages per section. It takes forever to navigate. Hopefully as I get my main setting settled, this wont be too much of an issue.* The histogram is lacking. You can only turn it on globally (can't choose to just have it show during playback) and there is no RGB histogram. The latter is a major disappointment.* The aperture only goes down to f/8, even in manual mode. Under most circumstances, this isn't a big deal, although the fastest shutter speed is only 1/4000, so bright sunlight could be trouble. Luckily the 3 stop ND filter helps mitigate the problem.Overall I find this a fine compliment to my DSLR, but I personally wouldn't use it as my only camera.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Truely amazing image quality!", "Author": "OutdoorsyKindaGuy", "ReviewID": "R1T43EX9Y3UFA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will try to keep this short and sweet. I am not a professional photographer, but would call myself and \"advanced amature\". I studied the whole spectrum of high end pocket digitals for weeks before making my purchase, reading all of the reviews and finally settled on the Lumix DMC-LX7. I have no regrets. Panasonic hit a home run with this camera. Forget everything you have heard about sensor size and pixel density, this camera is techno nirvana. The bright, quality leica optics matched with the 10.1 MP sensor produces truely jaw dropping, sharp, and super bright image quality. The light gathering capabiliity of the optics is such that I rarely actually even use the pop up flash, even indoors with room level lighting. The wide angle lens feature is a benefit that surprised me with it's utility. Until you have the capability, you really don't know what you are missing.The camera quality is startling, the features intuitive, and I am thrilled with Panasonics latest entry into the high-end pocket camera market. I believe this camera will be the yardstick by which all others are measured. I also have a large frame Nikon DSLR and find that I rarely use it any more as I can get comparable results with none of the hassle.

That being said, I'll admit that I still enjoy taking pictures, especially of my family.  So I did a TON of research into the perfect camera (by my standards) and found that the LX7 fit these criteria:*size: not as cumbersome as my husbands T2i which I've come to refer to as the \"3rd child\".  I didn't need a pocket-able camera since I don't usually put cameras or phones in my pocket.*low-light use: like most parents, we are always taking pictures in various scenarios; the holidays and birthday parties don't usually offer optimal lighting...so after reading many many many reviews, I came to see that the LX7 is great at low-light shots.*macro: I take pictures for ebay and etsy and while I don't need my shots to look like I paid to have them taken, I do like a nice, clear, picture.  This has been next to impossible (especially with jewelry) with my husband's t2i since the only lens he has is huge and I can't zoom into the detail I want.  I have resorted to using my old Sony point-and-shoot for close-up shots, but I have to add A LOT of supplemental lighting, of which the quality isn't that great.With those criteria, I found the LX7 to fit the bill, but at the price point of almost 500, it was too much to spend on something I didn't \"need\", but when the price dropped around Cyber Monday, I promptly informed my husband and he generously purchased it as a Christmas gift for me.  That being said, I have only possessed this camera for a little over 24 hours, so my review is premature, but I will update when/if I see necessary.  Here's how it met my criteria:*size: PERFECT! it's small enough to throw in a bag or purse but large enough to stabilize.  On a side note, I feel I need to discuss the whole \"strap\" situation that many feel is a major concern.  Yes, the strap on the LX7 is awkward.  It's really a matter of personal preference.  I ordered a wrist strap for around 8 bucks.  I probably won't use the neck (shoulder) strap that it comes with since the camera isn't quite big/heavy enough to warrant a neck strap.  Again, I will update this review if my opinion changes once I actually use the wrist strap but so far I haven't found much use for the neck strap.*low-light use: I used the camera all day on Christmas and played around with it today (the day after) and rarely used the flash.  The camera takes great pictures in low-light situations.  I took lots and lots of shots of my Christmas tree without any supplemental lighting and they are all beautiful.  Just like any point-and-shoot, the flash tends to be very harsh and doesn't \"fill\" like it should, but I think that fact that you rarely need to flash makes up for the actual flash deficiencies, if that makes any sense.*macro: now this is where Cupid struck.  I love love love the macro.  It's divine! I've been playing around with the settings and tweaked it so that it takes perfect shots of the tiniest little toys.  I am very impressed with how well, even in the auto mode, it takes pictures and gets the fine details.  All without the harshness of the flash.Some other notes are that I did put the pictures on my desktop (an iMac) and they look superb.  Not 100% of the gift-opening pictures came out great, but there was A LOT of movement in a relatively low-lit area. I am very happy with how easy this camera is to use.And one more note on the lens cap since I feel I need to put my two-cents in.  Really, people?? really????? It's not a big deal.  It took me 1 nano-second to figure out how to very very quickly remove the lens cap with the flick of a finger.  I would rather not purchase an after-market supplementation that requires me to dismantle my camera to apply.  Those \"auto\" lens caps don't seem very safe to me.  I would worry about dust getting in.  Also, since it seems like most LX7 users also use a dSLR, I would think that the tiny lens cap (and supplied strap) wouldn't be a big deal.  But, that's just my opinion!I know my review isn't full of technical jargon and that's because I'm not familiar with all of that.  I think that if you're looking for an excellent point-and-shoot, this is the camera for you.  I think that if you're looking for a camera to carry around instead of a clunky dSLR, this is the camera for you.

Now if Amazon gets that required (ugh) $30.00 'filter adaptor' (that should have been built-in or free with the camera) I can proceed to go on off for another $40-50 for a B&W; UV filter to protect the lens, something that wasn't easily possible with the LX3 without buying one of those tubes and keeping it on all the time.

There is no weight to be felt, no balance, It\u2019s hard to tell if something is chromed plastic or polished stainless.  You can\u2019t see if one of your own accessories works with the unit. (Speedlight?)  And sometimes you just want someone else to look into something and tell you about it... tell you the real deal behind some of the marketing jargon and labels on the box.  If you just have to feel it, go shop at a store. Just remember that they deserve some business from you if you go in there and handle the merchandise and such.  Yes, the prices are usually a little higher.  Yes, they charge sales tax at the register. (You\u2019re supposed to pay any sales tax from internet purchases in your state tax return, so this shouldn\u2019t be a factor)  But buy something from your local camera store, even if it\u2019s only prints you buy.  Support them as well as Amazon.Now on to the review, almost all of which I wouldn\u2019t have learned from a few minutes of experimenting in a store, it has taken a few days to learn these things.Cons are arranged from most to least offensive and pros are from least to most thrilled about.Cons:Firmware: Time Lapse is one of those features you see on the list and say... YES! I want that! But it\u2019s not a sole reason to buy.  After all, I have a GoPro, DSLR, several unused Android phones with cameras, and an old Canon P&S; with the CHDK software.  I\u2019m set for TL units.  However, I\u2019m still disappointed in this because the time lapse settings are limited to sixty shots at the most,  and one minute between shots at a minimum.  Do I get this correct,  a 2 second maximum length of a time lapse clip that takes at least an hour to make?  Three words... Firmware Update Needed.  Really, send a firmware update that opens this up to as many shots as we want to take... and more importantly...down to the 1 second between shots range as well.Grip:  Remember,  I'm coming from a D7000 with a battery grip.  It's huge in comparison.  It's super easy to grip, hold and control.  The lx7 is small.  It fits in my pocket.  It's small enough that I have to say it's difficult to hold on to.  I can hold my DSLR with one finger under the lip of the grip and gravity keeps it there. I'm cautious about using one hand with this little thing.  Not much room on the back for my thumb to grip it with.  If I\u2019m rotating the thumbwheel, I MUST grip it with the other hand, because I lose the grip with my right hand.Zoom control: I realize this is typically a camera that people are advancing to from a <$200 p&s;,  but I hate the zoom being on the shutter release instead of the barrel.  If we could have a rear button programmed to release the shutter, this wouldn't be so bad, but running the zoom seems to loosen my grip just like adjusting the thumbwheel does.  I hear this is where the Sony outshines this unit, in that the lens ring can be programmed to operate zoom, focus, or aperture. (obviously not all three at the same time)  An alternative would be to make the zoom control operated by the thumb, even via the same ring on top, just put that protruding part toward the back instead of the front... or dare I say it...BOTH.  Let the user decide which  part to use.Tripod mount:  This is way off center.  Way, way off.  If it were closer to center,  then leaving a tripod mount attached would allow it to rest on a counter without being crooked... But, it\u2019s a very lightweight camera and being off-center is not a problem except for the most flyweight of tripods.Neutral:Sensor size. I\u2019d have loved to see a larger sensor, but I chose this over cameras that do have larger ones. This one is 10MP at 1/1.7\u201d  However, I think this unit makes up for sensor size issues with that wonderful lens.  Since *most* of the photos will be taken with adequate light or a flash there isn\u2019t much of a problem with the very low light end of the spectrum.  I\u2019d rather have consistently sharp (which they are) and fringing free (again) photos over something that can turn out a muddy shot taken by starlight.  10MP is more than enough for nearly any print from this...really, even though the manual says it\u2019s only good up to A4 size.  When you get to a 36\u201d print, do you really need it to be 300 pixels per inch?  Isn\u2019t it going to be viewed from about 4 to 6 feet away?  You\u2019ll never see the pixels at 75 pixels per inch from anything more than 2 feet away. If you would like to test this, just look at your 75 pixel per inch monitor from 2 feet or more, or your HDTV which is only 2MP from more than 4 feet.  Lots of articles on this, so I\u2019m going to leave it at that.Pros:Quiet.  It's near silent in operation when you turn the beeps off. Only the faintest click is audible from the shutter.  I took it on a ghost hunt.  Nobody could hear it,  and it wasn't overly bright from the screen in the darkness.  I\u2019m not sure, but I think it dimmed itself somewhat in the ambient light.Flash hotshoe:  Yes, this WILL fire a modern Canon and Nikon flash when they are set in Manual mode. (Not TTL, you will need a Panasonic flash for TTL, Metz also makes one to work with the Lumix series)Style :  Wow,  this thing is great looking.  I got it in white,  because I'm soooooo tired of the typical black, heat generating, I-look-just-like-everything-else camera. The white and silver looks great.  Why is Pentax the only maker with white DSLR Cameras?Features:  Lots of them.  There are creative modes that can be applied after the shots are done, nice for those of us that like to shoot RAW and edit later.  Many, many different scene modes, that I actually like.  Again, some people just want RAW, and others just want scene and style shots.  While I doubt I\u2019ll ever shoot in sepia or B&W;, as I like to do that in post-production, I do see myself using several other modes from time to time.  I like them.  There is a lot more to this than just creative styles, it also has white balance bracketing.  Not only white balance bracketing as in temperature,  but two dimensional bracketing,  to include both blue/yellow and magenta/green selection.  Not only two dimensional bracketing,  but it's fully user selectable on both sides of the center shot, not just a +- 1 or 2.  This is usually a Pro/Enthusiast level DSLR feature.  It can even learn what you look like (or your most often photographed human subjects) and tag the photo with their name(s). Your mileage may vary here, especially for twins.  Aspect ratio bracketing is available, although I don\u2019t see myself using that.  It\u2019s fast... I think it shoots 11 frames per second (jpg) and can go up to 128000 ISO in the extended ISO range.  (this essentially increases the sensel size on the sensor by combining nearby pixels to increase the sensitivity, therefore it saves the shot as a 2 to 3 MP jpg image, a bit blurry, but if you really need a starlight illuminated action shot, you got it.)  For most shots of 1/20 or faster you\u2019re best off at ISO 3200 or lower.  Standard tripod mount long exposures are fine. (I recommend using the 2 second timer delay)  If you really want a camera that takes action shots in the dark, you\u2019ll need to shell out about $8500 and get a f2.8 or faster lens and a Canon 1DMk4 or a Nikon D4.  But for just a few hundred bucks, this pocketable camera really is a great low-light shooter.  (Hint: use the night scene mode until you understand the exposure triangle.)The Lens:  Did I mention the lens?  It\u2019s incredibly sharp and free from distortions.  It focuses quite fast.  Sure, it\u2019s only 24mm to 90mm equivalent.  But it\u2019s a high quality 24mm to 90mm.  Crop it if you want to zoom further.  But wait, there\u2019s more.  iZoom, a feature built into software, helps you zoom further than the optical zoom.  It\u2019s not just cropping the image like most digital zooms, it actually interpolates the pixels to get a better image than cropping will provide.  Yes, it works.  No, it\u2019s not perfect.  If you\u2019re thinking it will work like the computers in TV shows that take a pixelated shot and enhance it to read the licence plate, you\u2019ll be disappointed.  You\u2019re living in a fantasy world also.  The lens is still fantastic, though.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality, flexible, pocketable camera (as long as you're not wearing skater jeans).  Good for novices, good for a step up from a basic p&s; or camera phone, and it's good for a pro to carry as an all-around or traveler camera.

Taken ~200 shots, a little video.Cons (since this is what you want to know about first)- Price on Amazon fluctuates wildly (from $413 a few days ago, up to $488 today). I bought at $449 and consider it a camera worth the price, at least this month.- Auto white balance is meh.- Not supported yet by many open-source .raw developers (RawTherapee, UFRaw). There might be fixes I'm unaware of.- A little too large for the average pants pocket- Cheap rear dial; ND/MF button doesn't feel solid either- No remote- Slow zoomPros- Good low light performance. Has small sensor vs. other premium compacts, but faster lens. Sensor is better than LX5 (acc. DPReview.com). This was important, as I considered the LX5 as well (for ~$150 less)- Aperture ring is nice- Sweet, sweet movie mode settings with mic that works well indoors.- Great resolution on the LCD- Aspect ratio control is surprisingly convenient, though I wish I could lock it.- Quick access menus work pretty well- Step zoom setting that lets you choose 24, 28, 35, 50, 70, or 90 mm focal lengths. Setting \"Lens Resume - Zoom\" to \"on\" while shooting in Aperture Priority, then saving as a custom setting basically gives you a rangefinder style camera with a fixed prime (as long as you don't change the zoom before you turn the camera off). Hope Panasonic someday includes a feature to customize startup zoom directly.I haven't bought other premium compacts, but this is way way better than a regular compact, and its feature suite seems tailored towards video. I would presume, based on my experience with Nikon DSLRs and Panasonic's mirrorless cameras, that there are better stills cameras out there (feel free to comment below), but the video will be hard to beat.  I want all around performance, and am pretty happy with this camera, but for high depth of field, I'm going to use a Nikon DSLR.*Update 12/16/12I've taken the LX7 outdoors some more, and have noticed that there's some chromatic aberration in the lens that's especially visible in strong light.

I wanted a small camera to carry everywhere as a supplement to my Panasonic G3 and other bigger SLR's that could shoot in RAW.  The big news, of course, is the f 1.4 lens.

Been  getting paid for my photography for over 20 years. Have traveled all over LatAm and Caribbean and have ALWAYS used Poing + Shoot cameras.

When Canon came out w their G series I owned each model from the G1 to the G10, then switched to the S models and owned the S90, S95 and S100. I even owned a cool looking but terribly performing FujiX10 which I dumped in 2 months. My last Canon was the S100 until I discovered this camera. I was blown away by what I saw. It isn't as compact as the S100 and it doesn't perform as great in high ISO as the S100 (not crazy about it past ISO640 but I never have to even go that high. The LX7 has an incredibly fast 1.4 lens which @ ISO400 is incredible. Hell, I don't even need 1.4, I ca live w/1.8 very happily. The LX7 has a ton of features, too much to list. I don't need that many to be happy but I'm constantly mixing formats, film styles, motor drive speeds etc to create custom settings. For those of you who shoot video, this camera will blow you away. I looooove the HD 120fps option. Quality in low light is amazing. Sound is OK, no outside mic jack so bring your own audio recorder if you are serious, in fact, do that no matter what camera you use. Audio is king. I immediately ordered the LVF2 to out on the hot shoe. It was like adding some extra home made bbq sauce to those incredible ribs you smoke for 8 hours. I was in love w the camera already, now I'm ready to marry it. Recently shot a travel gig in Puerto Rico for a magazine and packing my gear I had to talk myself to pack my pro DSLRs instead of just taking my LX7. In the end, I coulda done w.out the heavy Pelican case and the L lenses and coulda shot everything w.the LX7. It's that great. I also ordered an extra Panasonic battery (don't get the aftermarket ones) and haven't needed to replace the batts while working yet. With the LVF2 you don't consume that much juice. I consulted a god friend who lives in Cuba and shoots a lot of street photography for European magazines, and he sealed the deal for me when he told me he uses 2 Panasonics, an LX7 and an LX5, as his digital Leicas.

Schuyler", "ReviewID": "RFLZ3UWDMKUIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a camera hobbyist for years, having owned many high end compact cameras, and I've experimented with DSLR's for a while.  I'm not a pro by any means but do love photography, both for family/kids and also landscapes, trips and various creative expressions.  I'm probably your typical camera hobbyist.  My other camera is a Sony SLT A33, with a decent collection of Minolta/Sony lenses.  I caught this Panasonic (my first) when it dropped to $299 and I took a chance on it, feeling guilty doing so. ;-)  But no regrets now, it's awesome.  I was considering the Olympus XZ-1 and LX-5 as alternates, which are now pricier, but I prefer this camera for the better lens and faster/more accessible performance to those.  The Sony RX100 looked interesting, but not at 2x the price.  My Sony SLT is extremely responsive with an outstanding sensor and tons of features...but I find I just don't use it that much.  Maybe its the heft, maybe its the gap in my lens collection, I don't know.  Even though its relatively small compared to SLR's, it is always too much and too little, if you know what I mean.  After years of experimentation with camera systems there's no escaping that realization that all camera solutions are really that perfectly united combo of body+lens.  The real question is, when you leave the door...what combo of lens and body do you bring with you?  The power and flexibility are always going to be lacking unless you haul a bunch of stuff around with you.  With an SLR/SLT, and even with all the diminutive new mirrorless systems, you get tons of power and flexibility at the price of carrying multiple lenses and having to buy and protect those expensive lenses, each and every day.  This is as true for the NEX systems as it is for a high-end Nikon DSLR.  Do you carry a big bag of lenses and accessories around your neck 24/7?  Is that fun?  Did you spend $1500 minimum on extra lenses?  If you answer no to these questions then you're not really tapping most of the power of those better camera bodies.  Some folks out there are into photography enough to do that, and I can understand that.  But for most of us hobbyists I'd argue that all interchangeable lens systems are a real pain.  Interchangeable lens systems work great as a system for manufacturers to sell lenses, but I doubt they're what most of us want/need.  I've thought like many I suppose that I'd invest in a decent body and upgrade the lenses over time, and I did that.  But it never really satisfies.  The better lenses are always very expensive, and each individual lens has major strengths and weaknesses, and/or are difficult compromises.  Even if you buy those nicer lenses you're always wanting to fill the gap in use, thus necessitating the 30 lb bag around your neck.Enter the Panasonic LX-7, its a relatively compact awesome portable system that just takes great photos and leaves plenty of fun for the hobbyist.  I find this lens range is extremely awesome, the combo of wide angle and wide aperture makes for an awesome family camera especially indoors where you can really capture architectural spaces and compositions of people within those spaces.  For me 28mm isn't enough.  The wide angle is a god send and I don't know how I lived without that for so long (oh I remember, quality DSLR wide angles are ridiculously pricey when you factor in the 1.x+ crop factor from your typical sensor).  I can't really imagine a better arrangement than this lens range. The fact that the lens is so bright allows you aperture affects that I've never seen on a compact, depth of field just like a DSLR; truly easy to isolate a subject from its background.  For macro shots there is no better camera for non-pros, it can focus to 1cm!  Autofocus is fast. It has an 11 fps burst mode.  Video capability is great.  The lens is truly sharp, not soft like others have mentioned.  Check for yourself on the camera review sites and carefully examine the sample photos for that sharpness.  I'll bet this is the best lens on any compact...wide, ultra bright, and ultra sharp corner to corner.  This sensor is good enough to get the job done, and the LX has tons of features to assist making the most of that lens.  Don't fret over just high-iso performance, things are fine at night to ISO 800, and you can easily limit the camera to that in the menus.  The aperture ring on the front and dial on the back allow you to use Manual mode to adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.  Its amazing most cameras don't have that capability since ISO, shutter speed, and aperture are so much of photography.  About my only wish would be for the ring to be programmable, maybe for manually focusing...but otherwise I'm quite happy!", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "An Amazing Camera For the Price - A Great Camera By Almost Any Standard. Panasonic Got This One Right.", "Author": "J. Bellin \"analog_j\"", "ReviewID": "R3LLRBMDWVRM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera, the white bodied version, for about 6 months as of this writing. I'll say that, at its current street price of about $300US, it's a steal and about the best compact camera under $600 you can find. In some ways, it's the best you'll find up to about $1000 depending on which criteria are important to you.Different people are looking for different things in a camera, aside from merely its ability to shoot photographs reliably. Is this camera weatherproof? No. Fit in jeans pants pocket? No. Interchangeable lenses? No. Want to blow photos up to 6 foot by 9 foot poster sized images? Ehhh... not the best choice. Need wifi capability? No.  Need to be able to capture that 4 inch creature on your safari that sits 300 feet high in the trees? Not with the built-in lens (The lens offers incredible wide-angle and closeup ability, but not great at pulling in far objects via a strong zoom).  Okay, you get the idea?However, if you're looking for a relatively light, smallish camera which can take astonishingly vibrant photos, can take great photos in low light light without flash, can get great \"bokah\" (the ability to have the foreground be in focus while the background is way out of focus -- great for portraits and closeups) due to its astonishing 1.4 aperture Leica zoom lens, this is a fantastic camera. The LX7 is great for relative beginners because it takes fantastic photos even in its auto settings. But this camera has the manual operation and adjustability that professionals and serious amateurs love.There are people out there, sometimes known as pixel peepers, who seek larger and larger sensors in smaller and smaller packages, and focus a great extent on the number of megapixels on a camera. This can be a mistake. Why? Because the camera's designers don't always assign the pixels to do what they really should do to take the best pictures. Pixels, the receptors on the sensor, can be individually assigned to do one of two things but not both-- absorb light and color, or detailed information of the scene. Designers have to decide the number on a sensor to do one thing and the remaining ones to do the other.A really tiny sensor could have, in one extreme, all pixels assigned to interpreting light and color. This would make for a richer, more dynamic shot, and able to do well in low light, but would leave a blurry image with little detail of the actual subject. The other extreme, having the pixels focus on detail, would leave a more detailed image with its ability to blow up the final image to larger sizes, but colors and dynamics would be washed out and the camera would have little ability to take photos in low light. Pumping up contrast and color after the fact is not all that satisfactory because you're adding artifacts which just aren't there in the original shot.So a solution could be to have a massive sized sensor with lots of pixels assigned to detail and lots of pixels assigned to color and light. Right, but that requires a BIG camera, such as a DSLR or larger (You might be aware of those 5\"x8\" film cameras - those took amazingly detailed and rich shots). But now you want a compact camera, easy to tote around that is not heavy. Okay, so you'll need to compromise with a sensor size that will do well enough in most areas, without compromising too much in any area. Panasonic has done it brilliantly here, better than in ANY of their other compact cameras, even better in certain situations than in a the vaunted Sony RX100 compact camera, with its larger sensor.Some will look at a 10MP camera like this initially and think that I could buy more megapixels for less money. But more megapixels on a smaller sensor (and the LX7's sensor is larger than most compact cameras and much larger than smartphone cameras) means that most of those megapixels are being devoted to detail, not color and light. If a photo is bereft of color finesse, richness and dynamics, it lacks much life. This same sensor size has been used on cameras that render up to 16 megapixels. But Panasonic knew that richness and life in a photo is likely important to the more serious amateur and professional photographers out there. The downside is that you won't be able to blow up photos beyond perhaps 11x14\" images without seeing some relative lack of sharpness. But the images will be much more rich. Furthermore, that ability to take in low light (because more of the sensor is devoted to light and color sensitivity) along with the fantastic 1.4 aperture Leica lens allows you to take low light and night photography often without the use of a flash.While this camera is over one year old in terms of its release, Panasonic's more recent LF1 has a different set of priorities. The same sensor sized camera, it devotes more of them to detail (12MP on the LF1). The lens is slower, so the camera is not as good in low light. The zoom lens is stronger on the zoom end, but it's not as sharp. The LF1 is truly pocketable, able to fit in jeans pocket if necessary. It has a built-in, albeit a weak one, electronic viewfinder -- what you see is what you get. The LX7, on the other hand, offers as an added accessory a really good electronic viewfinder for those who prefer to compose through one as opposed to using the very good LCD. I do find myself using the LVF2 electronic viewfinder on my LX7 as I feel I am closer to the composition (I like getting artsy fartsy with the camera sometimes).Finally, there are physical limitations with regard to sensor size and camera size. The larger the sensor, the larger the lens needs to be in order to allow the all of the light to hit the whole sensor. The Sony RX100 indeed has a larger sensor in a smaller camera than the LX7. But there are situations where the LX7 can, from comparisons I have read, take better photos in lower light, not to mention that the edge to edge sharpness of the LX7's lens is supposed to better than the one on the RX100. So perhaps in the middle of the day in bright sunlight (the easiest situation for a camera to work), you'll be able to blow up the images from the RX100 larger than the ones from the LX7 because the former has a larger sensor. But the RX100 is not a better camera in all situations.But the RX100 goes for about $550 right now. And the RX100II goes for $700. The LX7 is going for $300. See why this camera is such a bargain? For the same $300 you can still get a 2-year old design Panasonic 4:3 sensor size camera (larger than the LX7's) with interchangeable lens ability. But its zoom starts at 3.5 aperture at its widest. Again, the LX7's lens starts at 1.4, MUCH wider. Look up individual Leica 1.4 lenses and you'll see that they go for $1000 and up. To get a 1.4 Leica quality lens in a $300 camera that is as easy to use (though the included digital manual is not very good at explaining the more intricate aspects to the camera -- get the White book guide instead.) is ridiculously great. This camera is an amazing achievement for Panasonic.Taking its limitations into account as a camera which is not a be-all, end-all for all users, Panasonic has created a camera which allows for some astonishingly great photos in a compact size. It's a well-built, solid camera, to boot (nothing cheap feeling about it, except perhaps for the plastic battery door, but minor quibble).  Forget about megapixel numbers. This thing takes fantastic photos!A further thought:Video quality from this camera is surprisingly really good, far better than what I get from my Galaxy S3 smartphone. I'm sure that has to do with both the quality of the lens as well as the camera's built-in sophisticated digital processing - something that also makes the standard JPEG still files top notch.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "LX7: Excellent Low-Light camera for clubs, bars, concerts, etc.", "Author": "Lowell", "ReviewID": "RVSQUMNATXAFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For over the past 2 years my Panasonic LX5 has been my pocket-friendly, carry-everywhere compact camera; and I used it primarily for very low-light shooting (no flash, hand-held; mainly still photos, but some videos) of local musicians in bars, clubs, concerts, etc. I didn't really need a replacement for the LX5 but got caught up in the Cyber Monday buying spree when they discounted the newer LX7 for $299. I justified to myself that the faster (1 f-stop ) f/1.4 LX7 lens and the higher resolution Full HD (1080p) LX7 video was worth $299 (minus what I might sell the LX5 on ebay for), and the LX7 would be my new pocket-friendly carry-everywhere compact camera for the next 2 years, And I was certainly impressed with the first LX7 test shots of some local musicians in very low light shooting conditions, better than the LX5 shots (which were pretty good).Then I got to reading the great reviews on the Sony RX100 and wondered if perhaps my new pocket-friendly carry-everywhere compact camera for the next 2 years should be the RX100 (even at the higher price) rather than the LX7. So I purchased a RX100 and ran some back-to-back tests with the RX100 and the LX7. For my low-light shooting conditions, I felt the LX7 was a better low-light camera than the RX100, in that the overall pictures were brighter and had more detail in the darker areas. This was true for the wide end of the lens, and even more true for the long end of the lens. My conclusion was based on shooting in the Program mode and the Shutter priority mode, and the video mode.The LX7 bright lens throughout the entire focal length range (wide angle thru telephoto) was a pleasure to use, and was even more noticeable in the video mode. With the LX7 in video mode, I could start out with a great picture at the wide end of the lens, zoom in to the long end of the lens and the video image still stayed bright. With the RX100 and it's darker lens, I would start out with a great picture at the wide end, but when I zoomed in to the long end of the lens, the image got much darker than at the wide end. I loved the RX100 camera with all its great features and have no doubt that the image quality with its larger megapixel (20MP) sensor would be better in some shooting conditions than the LX7, But the 10 megapixels of the LX7 are more than I need for my shooting requirements, and low-light capability is more important to me than megapixels (although it might not be for others).The RX100 did have one nice low-light feature that the LX7 didn't have in the \"Anti Movement Blur\" mode where the RX100 would takes six shots in a rapid sequence, typically at a high sensitivity setting and a (relatively) fast shutter speed, and then combines them into a single image that has somewhat less noise than a single shot taken at the same ISO and exposure settings. The LX7 has a similar mode (Handheld Night Shot ), but not as effective at the RX100 Anti Movement Blur mode for my shooting conditions, in that the RX100 mode is more willing to pick a really high ISO setting like ISO 1600 or higher to maintain a fast shutter speed, whereas in the LX7 Handheld Night Shot mode, it seems to go only as high as necessary to avoid camera shake. That is, the RX100 Anti Movement Blur mode would shoot at higher shutter speeds and ISO levels than the LX7 Handheld Night Shot mode. The RX100 Anti Movement Blur mode was very good for extremely dark shooting situations (like the audience in the dark, with no direct light), but not so valuable with musicians on stage with a little light. But still a feature I wish the LX7 had.I think the Sony RX100 camera with its relative large sensor is a great low-light camera if you are shooting only at the wide end of the lens; but for all around shooting (throughout the full focal length range) under my shooting conditions, I think the Panasonic LX7 does a much better job with its smaller sensor but brighter lens.Actually I was kind of puzzled by some of the great low-light reviews on the RX100 camera. It's true that the RX100 sensor is much larger than the LX7 sensor, but the RX100 sensor has twice the megapixels than the LX7. The resulting pixel size of the RX100 is still larger than the LX7 pixels, but only by about a .77 stop at the wide end based on my calculation. At the wide end, the brighter lens of the LX7 is about 0.72 stop better than the RX100, so that essentially cancels out the advantage of the larger pixel size of the RX100. And at the long end of the lens, the low-light advantage become more in favor of the LX7 camera. Many of these reviews are based on only high ISO performances, which is not the same as low-light performance which takes into account the brightness of the lens (bright lenses can operate at lower ISO values). In several online blog postings where actual \"real-world\" back-to-back photos were shown between the LX7 and the RX100, the LX7 appeared to do an equal or better job at low-light conditions at the wide end of the lens, which tended to confirm my own back-to-back testing.Also, the image stabilization on the LX7 is excellent, I've taken many photos at 1/5 second with no camera shake blur. I feel that I could even shoot slower.  I've not been able to quantify how the LX7 compares with the RX100 on this issue, but I've read where the LX7 is better.In summary, I feel the RX100 and the LX7 are both excellent compact cameras and can recommend them both; but for me the low-light capability of the LX7 in normal shooting modes (Program, Shutter Priority, video mode, etc.) in both wide angle and telephoto gave it the edge. So I kept the LX7 and returned the RX100. I would have like to have kept them both, but I felt the LX7 would have been the one I would have used most of the time.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lumix LX7 vs. Sony RX100 initial observations", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R3CILZ0V0RNKVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to compare my new Lumix LX7 against a Sony RX100 and decided to just take some random images using each cameras automatic modes.

The images were a mix of landscapes, macros, indoors, etc.In general the IQ differences between the two were very subtle.The Sony very slightly edges out the Lumix in most scenes for IQ.  The biggest difference I noticed was that the Sony did a much better job with automatic white balance. It was pretty impressive in this regard. (not much need for post processing).The Lumix did a better job then Sony in close up Macro's.  (even when Sony images are cropped)The Lumix seems much better built then the Sony.

I am using it much more than I thought I would.I particularly like having the lens aperture and the aspect ratio control on the rings around the lens. (Unlike most digital cameras, the LX7 maximizes the available sensor real estate for each aspect ratio rather than cropping everything down from the native 4:3 ratio. So, you do find yourself changing the aspect ratio to suit the particular picture you are taking.)Image quality is much better than I expected from a small 10 M pixel sensor.

Previous models have been well received and unless you have them side by side you would be hard pressed to see any real differences in the way the LX-7 looks and feels compared to it's immediate predecessor, the LX-5 introduced two years ago.  This time, however, the LX-7 is not alone and in fact there is an elephant in the room, the Sony RX100, that really cannot be ignored if one is to understand the merits of the Panasonic LX-7.The Sony RX100 has made it to the Time Magazine list of 25 best inventions of the year - and as we know, Time is never wrong.  Well almost never.  The RX100 is truely pocketable, able to fit into a shirt pocket whereas the LX-7 needs a jacket pocket.  The RX100 has 20M pixels and the LX-7 has only 10M pixels, potentially improving resolution and cropping ability.  The RX100 has a sensor that is 2.8 times the area of the one in the LX-7.  And to get these features the RX100 sells at a different price point than the LX-7, roughly 150 dollars more at suggested retail and because the LX-7 has been undergoing price fluctuations lately, I've noticed that sometimes the difference is closer to 240 dollars!  This cost difference alone may steer many away from the Sony, unless, of course, you really want a high quality shirt pocketable camera.Now why consider the LX-7, other than price.  It's the lens. The LX-7 has a lens that extends from 24mm to 90mm (35 mm camera equivalent values) while the Sony starts at 28 mm and goes to a little above 90mm).  The LX-7's widest lens opening is f1.4 and never exceeds f2.3 over its range.  The Sony RX100 starts at f1.8  and quickly goes to f2.8 (at 35mm) and eventually goes to f4.5 at 90mm.  This means that the LX-7 has about a half stop advantage at wide angle, a 1.44 stop advantage at 35 mm and nearly a 2 stop advantage at 90mm.  What does this mean for the performance of the LX-7, since this is one of the prime reasons to purchase this camera?The large sensor is the heart of the RX100. Because its area is 2.8 times that of the LX-7 its noise or grain at any ISO value should be significantly better (lower) than the LX-7, in fact if it had 10M pixels it should have about a 1.5 stop advantage.  The fact that it has 20 M pixels, means that the area of each pixel is cut in half and the advantage over the LX-7 drops to around half a stop.  Of course, there are ways to combine the pixels, effectly increasing the area of each pixel and to reduce the noise again.  I took a look at the RAW samples of the LX-7 and the RX100 via the dpreview site and compared them at ISO 400.  In my view, the RX100 is clearly better at ISO 400 than the LX-7 at ISO 400 but the RX100 at ISO 800 looked worse than the LX-7 at ISO 400.  This crudely confirms that the RX100 sensor has somewhat less than a 1 stop advantage over the LX-7. What does all this mean with respect to daylight and low light photos?In daylight (good light), the RX100 should perform about 1 stop better than the LX-7 since both cameras are probably at their lowest ISO setting and have similar lens openings.  Fortunately, the Panasonic LX-7 noise or grain is reasonable at this setting and unless one pixel peeks (looks at really large blowups of small sections of the image) one will not see much difference.  Also in dim light at 28mm, since both cameras would probably be set to the lowest f stop, the RX100 would have a one stop advantage.  Once one moves away from 28 mm, however, the Panasonic LX-7's lens has a two stop advantage as stated above, and it can become the camera most likely to produce the lowest grain.And lets not forget the 24mm wide angle of the Panasonic LX-7.  For some, this is the deal clincher.  Sure it can get more people into a group picture in close quarters, and more landscape into your images, but many believe, in fact that it should be used as a close up lens, providing a sense of depth to your image. Move in close to an object, and have an interesting background and this lens will add perspective to your image.  Just don't try to make the closeup object an adult face since they will not be happy with the big nose look - mine is large enough as it is.So the LX-7 works well in daylight (the RX100 may work a little better if you care to pixel peek), but the advantage really goes to the LX-7 in dim light because of its relative constant f stop.  Having 24mm doesn't hurt either.  If only it would fit into a shirt pocket.I suppose another consideration might be purchasing the previous model, the LX-5.  As of this writing it is still available for around 300 dollars, and I've even seen it for sale at 250 dollars.  The construction differences between the LX-5 and my LX-7 are really minimal with both being high quality.  The LX-7, given its f1.4 lens and improvements in its sensor, mean it has about a 1.5 to 2 stop improvement in light gathering ability over the earlier model.  The display screen resolution has doubled to over 900,000 pixels (nice).  There is an aperture ring around the lens akin to cameras of old, a convenient touch and selecting aperture using it is way easier than using the rotating wheel on the camera rear.  The LX-7 can also show a horizontal and vertical level which can be helpful in some situations. And the video resolution has increased from 720p to 1080p - true HD. I'm not sure that the LX-7 white balance works well, but since I shoot in RAW, this has not bothered me since that is simple to correct (and one of the reasons to shoot in RAW, of course.  Post processing with Adobe Photoshop CS6 makes processing RAW straight forward since ACR is becoming the perferred work flow, but that is another story.)For me, the LX-7 is the camera to take when I want to travel fairly light and I am not worried about subject motion  in dim light(High ISO).  For the most part the LX-7 has decent image quality up to ISO 400 (shooting RAW) maybe even ISO 800 with some noise suppression.  But it is not a DSLR.  IF you look - pixel peek, you can still see noise, even at base ISO and bringing up the shadows can also create visible noise.  As the saying goes, there is no perfect camera.  When I want really low noise, or I expect really dim conditions with movement, such as the grandkids in theater productions out comes the DSLR.  Also shooting inside museums (paintings), if allowed, seems to work best for me with wide apertures and high ISOs, another use for DSLRs.  But naturally the price to pay is size and weight and sometimes large cameras just seem out of place.  For the moment, this camera represents state-of-the art performance, in a reasonably small package and a reasonable price. But the Sony RX100 just may show the way forward.12/20/2012This was a really great camera when I bought it at over $400 but when it went to $300 it became sensational.  Since I still had some time left on the Amazon return policy I contacted them and they sent out a new LX-7 at the reduced price which I shipped back to them unopened for the refund on the original camera which I kept.  Great, but a little cumbersome.  You would think that they would just credit me with the difference, saving postage.As I use the camera more, I find low light performance works as well as I thought it did initially and, in fact, I am more willing to shoot at ISO 800.  Using a Topaz Labs plug-in and Adobe raw processing has produced very useful results at this and even at ISO 1600 for small prints.  I have found that using the display as a viewfinder in bright light can be a pain (as it is on all such cameras, it seems) so I have used my savings to purchase the Electronic Viewfinder (EVF) which adds bulk to the camera when attached.  It comes in a little pouch that can go in a pants pocket and I will probably use it on bright summer or winter days or when I shoot grandchildren in plays (the lit screen can be annoying in a darken theater).  This EVF gives a really crisp image and, like the Sony RX-100 probably points to the future.  I suspect that if this is an example, we will see more of these at even higher resolution on SLR type cameras (Sony and Olympus already are there, it seems). Anyway, at prices close to $300 this camera is hard to beat.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "wonderful little camera", "Author": "Ted Orland", "ReviewID": "R1PN2DPA41ZLQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the LX7 as a replacement for my LX5, and my observations here are mainly about the differences between the two.Generally speaking, almost everything about the LX7 -- start-up, focusing, and of course the f1.4 lens -- works faster and/or better than on the LX5. Perhaps most importantly, the LX7's f1.4 lens is every bit as sharp as the f2.0 lens on my LX5. And despite the camera's small sensor, identical daytime scenes photographed with my LX7 and with my Canon T1i are indistinguishable as 11x14 prints.The LVF-2 electronic viewfinder for the LX7 is a pure joy to use, markedly improving upon the LX5's LVF-1 in resolution and (to a lesser degree) brightness. But it's also noticeably larger than the earlier EVF, which slightly undercuts the LX7's charm as a high-end \"stealth camera\". (BTW, the EVF for the LX7 can NOT be used on the LX5, nor vice-versa.)The LX7's menu listings remain a jumble -- not exactly confusing, but way too lengthy and convoluted to memorize easily. It really helps to spend a couple of hours with the on-screen manual before venturing out with camera in hand -- and a couple of hours in the field becoming facile with manipulating the settings in real-life situations. Many of the possible settings -- like, say, saving a file in RAW format -- work only in SOME of the shooting modes. The \"intelligent HDR\" mode, for instance, saves only in JPEG format. (Now why go to the trouble of using HDR if you only get a jpeg file to work with?)The lens itself feels quite vulnerable. The front element is large, not recessed, and does not allow for the addition of a lens shade. And it WILL get wet if exposed to even the faintest hint of mist or drizzle.Also, the battery runs down more rapidly on the LX7 than it does on the LX5. (The LX7 uses the SAME battery as the LX5, however, so if you're upgrading you can use the batteries for the two cameras interchangeably.)CONCLUSION: despite my nit-picking, the LX7 is a truly wonderful camera!

It's a \"mature\" product of sorts with the major flaws of the LX5 being addressed and upgraded where it counts...faster lens and lower noise sensor now with 1080p60 video.I will say that this camera is NOT for Joe Public who just wants to Point and Shoot and expect fantastic results. It's really meant for the intermediate or advanced shooter who likes to get the maximum out of the camera via semi or full manual control. I normally shoot in either Program or Aperture Priority mode to keep the lens in it's sweet spot of about f2.8 or if I want to keep a minimum shutter of at least 1/60 of a second via Program Mode.I normally shoot with a Canon 5D3 when I need fantastic results or super shallow Depth of Field and the LX7 is my \"everything else\" camera for birthday parties, trips to the beach, and just road trips where I don't want to deal with the bulkiness of a DSLR or the risk of damaging my equipment. Compared to my 5D3 and other compacts I used to own including the Canon S95 and even my recently sold Sony RX100, the LX7 images need some work to make them \"pop\". Perhaps it's because I use the Natural color setting which dulls the results for the sake of color accuracy and lower contrast. But the images are TACK SHARP from f/2 to about f/4. Anything beyond that and you begin to see signs of softening due to worsening lens/light diffraction. I have to admit I've been spoiled by Canon's jpeg colors. I have yet to shoot RAW with the LX7 since my use of the camera has been for non critical subjects thus far. But I will try it out soon.I only have a few minor quibbles with the LX7. For one thing, it is lacking some of the more common convenience features of WiFi, GPS, and Touchscreen. It would also be nice to have a built in lens cover instead of the cap. And I'd wish Panasonic could improve the jpeg color output closer to that of Canon's and Sony's. There are times when I wish I just don't have to adjust the colors in Lightroom or Photoshop. But that is really it and I know I'm being picky here. I just find the other color settings to be off. They are too saturated and the reds tend to push towards orange. Blue skys sometimes seem to have a magenta cast as well. But once I think about the fact the lens is at only f/2.3 at full zoom, I quickly forget about my complaints and go back to shooting since there isn't another camera, next to the overpriced rebranded Leica, that has such an amazing lens to keep ISO low and to not have to use flash.In conclusion, I'd say the LX7 is a no brainer if you own an DSLR and want something compact that can fit into large pant and jacket pockets.

I have been leaving it in \"IA\" mode (intelligent auto) for all of my shooting, treating it almost like a point & shoot camera, even though a professional photographer friend urges me to explore using some of the other modes (aperture priority, in particular). I will get around to doing that eventually. Meanwhile, I get great results already.The video is stunning, and I am not even using anywhere near the highest quality settings. I have the camera set to shoot 720p video, producing mp4 files. My old computer can play and edit these files easily.Note that the manual says that if you do use the highest quality video settings (HD, 1920x1080, 60p), and you want to view or edit the video on a computer, you will need a fast computer, specifically, an i7 machine. Friends of mine who edit video concur that such a fast computer is, indeed necessary. I don't have such a fast computer, and when I try to view HD, 1920x1080, 60p video on my computer, it plays in little short bursts. But this is not a problem of the camera; it is just a fact about the data rate required to play HD video.But again, even with the camera set to shoot lower resolution video, the results are great.In conclusion, this is a fantastic camera, at a great price.Some notes about the lens cap follow below:The original Panasonic lens cap, when attached to the camera, does not have enough room underneath for an adaptor ring and protective filter. But the original lens cap has the advantage that it locks into the outer, fixed barrel around the lens. It does not stick out very far. And it completely covers the air gap between the inner, telescoping barrel and the outer fixed barrel. And if the lens cap takes a hit, the impact is transmitted to the outer, fixed barrel and not to the telescoping inner barrel. The risk to using the original lens cap is, of course, that without a protective filter, the lens could get scratched.For that reason, I tried an EzFoto adapter ring, protective filter, and lens cap (available on Amazon).Unlike some other reviewers, I did not have any trouble removing the thread protector from my Panasonic LX7. The EzFoto adapter ring threads on easily enough, and the EzFoto adapter ring goes on easily and fills up some of the air gap between the inner, telescoping lens barrel and the outer, fixed barrel. But the EzFoto adapter ring and filter protrude from the front of the camera a few millimeters. When the EzFoto lens cap is attached, the resulting assembly is fairly thick, much thicker than the original lens cap. Also note that the EzFoto lens cap is attached to the EzFoto filter and adapter ring, which are threaded onto the inner, telescoping lens barrel. That means that if the camera takes a hit on the front, the impact is transmitted to the inner, telescoping lens barrel. (And the EzFoto lens cap comes with a small tether, but it is not at all clear how the tether is to be attached to the lens cap: the hole in the lens cap is much too small.)But in my last 25 years of using various kinds of cameras, I have never scratched a lens. My wife is very careful with the camera. When our 6-year-old son takes a picture with the LX7, even he is very careful to not touch the lens. The lens has gotten dirty, because we use the camera in a lot of fun situations, like at the beach on a windy day. But I have usually been able to simply blow off the dust with a squeeze bulb. The one time that the lens needed more than that, I used FormulaMC cleaner and a microfiber cloth to clean it very carefully. It came out looking like new. Our LX7 is a family camera, and we have fun with it and do not obsess over it, and yet the lens remains in perfect condition.So I don't think a protective filter is necessary. If one wants to attach some other kind of filter for special effects, then the EzFoto kit would be essential.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great \"In-betweener\"", "Author": "C.

I've just started using this camera, and I'm still discovering tons of new features so this review is based on my first experiences.What I like:1. Compact (i.e. lightweight) - I used the flimsy shoulder strap it came with and had the camera slung over my shoulder (diagonally across my chest) for over 3 hours and didn't mind the weight.2. Good in low light - This is a tricky one since what one considers low light may be quite different. Most of my low light situations have been indoors with a weak overhead light or a lamp in the corner. I pushed my luck with some of my pictures where there just wasn't enough light for my subject, and I got a little blur. Not the fault of the camera. You just need to be realistic about what the camera will do.3. Stereo sound - Yeah I know, that's like being excited about being able to make a call with a smart phone. I've been using a lot of point-n-shoots that had mono sound that was horrible. This is so much better.What I'm not as thrilled about:1. The lens cap - I don't expect it to automatically open. I'm used to lens caps on my dslr and other point-n-shoots. My main gripe is that it so dang small and is even smaller than the lens diameter. My hands are average size, probably more slender than average dudes, but I still struggle with getting the lens cap off and on. If you have big hands, I pity you.2. The manual focus - Here's where I probably should have done more research. I'm used to flipping a switch on a lens to the \"MF\" setting then grabbing the lens ring and focusing away. This camera is a quite a bit different. It's not necessarily bad... just different, and I find myself struggling to learn a whole new way of focusing with buttons. I'll probably just need to practice.Final Conclusion: For the price, this is a great camera.

I almost never really need a super telephoto, so the 90mm is not a big issue, especially since I realize that the cameras which offer wide angle and strong telephoto have inferior, slow lenses.  NO camera which does not have interchangeable lenses can maintain quality from 24mm or 28mm all the way up to 200 mm and even more. The specs will reveal the slowness of the lens (which is a direct indicator of quality, especially in low light), more apparent  at telephoto.  I shot professionally for over 20 years, wanted a camera that I would NOT leave at home (as I did my heavy Canon pro camera), would fit in a pocket, would take as good a photo as possible, have 24mm.  Also optional viewfinder, which I wound up buying for shots in bright sun, and is also more natural for me.  This camera had the features, especially real quality, I wanted, while at the fewest compromises.  Looks and  feels sturdy. Easy to use.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "THIS PANASONIC LX7 KEEPS SURPRISING ME!", "Author": "David Ruether", "ReviewID": "RRDTO3L3KGAOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[This review appears on my web site along with some 1920x1440 photo samples and a video frame-grab. Search my name to find it.]After several months of playing with the pocketable Panasonic DMC-LX7, here is what I think about it so far...:THE GOOD:-- The overall design, small size, low weight, and handling characteristics of the Panasonic LX7 are excellent - and it even fits nicely into a shirt pocket!-- Its 24mm-90mm lens (35mm full-frame equivalent) is a very good and fast f1.4-f2.3, and it can take surprisingly good stills and video even in low light levels.-- The zoom range can be extended from 24mm to 180mm-equivalent with \"iZoom\" enabled, with surprisingly good quality even at 180mm. The image quality does decline gradually as the zoom is extended beyond 90mm, but it remains useable for smaller images even at 180mm. The good close-focus capabilities of this lens are also maintained, so decent macro images can be made even at 180mm.-- Close-focus photos can easily be taken with the LX7, and even animal activities can be caught due to the very fast shutter response.-- The LX7 is very easy to use and to control in ALL modes. This camera was designed to be used by both snap-shooters and by those who like to \"fiddle with the guts\" while using a camera.-- It has MANY good adjustments in well-designed and organized menus, and numerous external controls are also available for changing and optimizing camera functions. Some of these can even affect aspects of the internal digital image processing that are normally beyond user control. All things can be independently adjusted, and the LX7 gets an A+++ for this. A brief printed manual is included with the box, and the rather lengthy complete manual is included on a disk, also in the box, along with some additional photo and video editing software. The LX7 complete manual (all 226 pages of it!) is also available online as a PDF file.-- The built-in light metering display and the camera leveling indicators are good. Interesting is the ability to move the image in the display panel upward to clear some information display areas (and all non-image material can also be cleared from the display).-- The high-resolution OLED rear screen is good, and it can be made VERY bright by adding together the effects of adjusting a couple of different menu controls (although doing this does shorten the small battery's run time). Several other types of display adjustments can also be applied to customize the viewing image. I find the LX7's screen easy to use for precise framing, even in sunlight.-- Mini USB/AV and HDMI ports are provided.-- A high-resolution accessory EVF is available, but it is relatively expensive compared with the original cost of the camera - and it may well be worth the price for some users.-- The lens is quite sharp, and it is even good when used wide-open throughout its zoom range (which is limited compared with that of many other compact cameras - but that trade-off is a useful one for having generally much increased lens speed available, and also for having its very high lens image quality).-- Having an aperture ring on the lens is handy, as is having the focus-mode and aspect-ratio selection switches also on the lens rather than having those functions in the menus.-- Setting the aperture to f2.2 (or to a smaller aperture) results in having what is essentially a constant-aperture zoom lens, useful when shooting video.-- The easily-engaged macro function works well for extending the lens focus range, and it is a useful feature.-- The various available shooting aspect ratios are 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, and 1:1 and, except for the last, all use the maximum sensor diameter available for the aspect ratio chosen. As a result, the image frame's long-side coverage angle is greatest with the aspect ratio set to 16:9, which can be useful with some types of subjects and with video with the lens set at its shortest focal length.-- The photo quality is generally very good, even in fairly low light levels - and video shot in low light is also surprisingly good.-- Image noise is fairly low, especially for a camera with a small sensor.-- The image doesn't have faults commonly seen in competing models, such as obvious CA problems, field curvature, illumination problems, and soft corners (and sometimes even soft edges). Even at remarkably wide stops, corners and edges look good in the LX7 images.-- The image stabilization works well, and it permits the successful hand-held use of shutter speeds that are considerably slower than those normally possible.-- Auto-focus is very fast and accurate, even in low light levels. I have been able to shoot sharp close-ups of a cat in low light that would be very difficult with any other camera I have used.-- Overall, the color is excellent - with a minor exception being that it sometimes tends to render some reds as more orange than they really are (although it often avoids a common tendency for blue skies to tend toward green in lighter-toned areas near the horizon).-- The video specifications are the same as for the excellent Panasonic TM700 camcorder, having a 28Mbps 1920x1080 60P video mode available (but, see below...).-- The video image is (fortunately!) unusually free of the common CMOS rolling-shutter distortion with panning.-- Video shot in bright light can be good (but not excellent), but (in common with most other still cameras with video added) it is not as good as that shot with a good similar-spec camera designed primarily for shooting video. The 28Mbps 1060-60P video is, though, MUCH nicer-looking than the 720P \"AVCHD-Lite\" video offered on many other compact cameras. It also looks better with motion than the video taken with most other cameras, which are limited to a 30P sensor frame rate.-- Video shot in low or medium light levels can look quite good, possibly because the lower edge contrasts likely to exist there show fewer of the image defects that can be more evident in bright light.-- A stereo microphone is included for video.-- Compared with the Panasonic GH3 body plus a zoom lens, the LX7 costs a small fraction of the price, it is FAR smaller and lighter, and its lens is generally almost three stops faster - but the video quality taken with Panasonic's best current micro four thirds format bodies is often considerably better.-- Given its high quality, its price can be quite moderate compared with its competition. While the  Panasonic DCM-LX7 retails for $500 in the US, it often sells for $450, and occasionally it even sells for $300, making it then a \"steal\"! Also, its functionally-identical \"partner\" camera (the Leica D-LUX 6) continues to sell for $800!-- A quite good 1.4-megapixel compact eye-level viewfinder is available for the LX7, and it can tilt up for low-level shooting.As I continue to enjoy using the LX7, I remain very impressed with (and surprised by) its photo image quality. Overall, the LX7 is a VERY good all-purpose pocket camera which is stronger with stills than it is with video, and it can take high-quality stills and better-than-OK video under a surprisingly wide range of conditions...THE BAD:-- The LX7 has a poorly-designed lens cap, and I replaced the original cap with something else that worked better - but if the original cap is used and it isn't removed before turning on the camera, the camera warns that it must be removed before turning the camera on again, preventing damage to the lens extension mechanism.-- One must pay an absurd amount for a small accessory threaded filter ring adapter and a new lens cap in order to fit 37mm filters on the lens. This part should have been originally made an integral part of the lens front structure. I ordered the replacement, but I was unable to remove the front ring from the lens to permit the installation of the Panasonic accessory ring, so I cancelled the order. I was also unable to remove the larger ring around the lens (this should bayonet off...) to add an inexpensive auto-folding cap. I eventually made my own cap with one that now covers most of the retracted lens barrel, and it comes off easily enough so that there can be no possible damage to the lens extension and zooming mechanism when the camera is turned on.-- There is no way to attach lens converters to the front of the lens (even with the accessory 37mm lens thread adapter installed on the lens) since the weight would have an ill effect on the lens telescoping and zooming mechanism.-- Serious lens flare is too often apparent when the sun is within the field of view or just outside of it (but otherwise there are generally no lens flare issues).-- Panorama photos often have unwanted vertical lines in them, and therefore using that mode may result in unsatisfactory images.-- The unmodified video quality is often so-so even in 28Mbps 1080-60P mode. Also, no matter what the picture settings are for video, some sharpening \"halos\" still show on high-contrast edges, as, oddly, do some occasional \"stair-stepping\" (aliasing) artifacts which are not ordinarily very evident with progressive scan 1080 video. These may indicate the use of some over-sharpening to offset sharpness losses that occur with down-sampling the stills resolution to the video resolution. Even so, the HD video quality from this camera (given its very small size) can look surprisingly good.-- The zoom control is generally too fast for video use, and the LX7 unfortunately lacks menu control over its speed.-- There is no remote control of any kind available.-- While the LX7 can record acceptable-quality stereo sound with its built-in microphone, it (not surprisingly) doesn't have microphone and headphone jacks.Overall, the LX7 is a nifty little camera, but I think it could easily have been even a bit better - but I really like this camera, I enjoy using it, and the results from it are surprisingly good!Highly Recommended!--DR", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the quality point&shoot; enthusiast.", "Author": "Vic", "ReviewID": "R33X2Y1GFW99ZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Canon S95 a few years back, to use it for work and home photography, and loved the portability of the small camera body, plus the manual controls, but was needing a camera with better low light capabilities than my Canon's F2.0 max aperture, and after much online reading, purchased the Panasonic DMC-LX7.The low light capabilities of the LX7 are amazing, with the F1.4 max aperture of the lens, I can take a side by side picture of an almost dark room with no flash, and the Canon's picture is dim and grainy, but the LX7's picture almost looks like there is a 25 watt bulb on in the room, and the ISO noise is relatively low.The LX7 is obviously a larger and heavier camera than the Canon offerings, but that is a logical tradeoff for a camera with these capabilities, when you consider the closest competition from Canon or Sony are hundreds of $ more expensive.The macro capabilities of the LX7 are also excellent, as I photograph engine parts up close at work, and can get as close as 1cm, and still have crystal clear focus, I cannot ask for more from a point and shoot.I have plenty to learn about the many functions and features this camera has, but at this time, and right out of the box, I believe I made a great choice, even though it is close to being discontinued, with rumors of an LX8 in the horizon.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "CMS", "ReviewID": "R2OZMP7NRO28ML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a point and shoot, and to supplement my better Nikon camera and accessories.

They were bridge cameras with much bigger 2/3\" sensors, 28-200mm f2.8 lenses, flip out and twist monitors and evfs all included (e.g. Minolta A200). Now all the manufacturers have value engineered them, so we have most of this category with tiny sensors (except Sony RX100) the Canon G15 without a flip out monitor or evf, the Nikon F7700 without ANY viewfinder, the Fuji X10 without a flip-out monitor (plus wierd sensor processing - orb issue), the LX7 with 90mm max zoom and fixed monitor, the RX100 pared down to lens and fabulous sensor (with price tag to match), and finally all the Micro 4/3rds cameras with only a 28-84mm equivalent zoom.How come the cheaper superzooms get evfs & flip out & twist monitors, but not enthusiast models?So since they are all missing limbs, I decided to get the cheapest to last for a couple of years and see if any of the manufacturers finally decide to offer the full kit. The LX7 dropped in price to $300 and I snagged it.Nevertheless, I have been pleasantly surprised. Yes, the zoom is a little too short for me (112mm would be fine) and I miss the flip out monitor for videos and kid shots but it has some great tricks. My favorite is the 'fixed' focal lengths. If you set it up right it moves directly between 24, 28, 35, 50 etc and the zoom memory returns it to previous zoom on start-up. This stops all the endless fiddling with the tiny zoom lever.

Does it have super-duper zoom? Nope. Does it have 15-20 MP? Nope. But who cares? Between the really fast Leica lens and its larger than average image sensor, this thing takes pictures like a dream! Having owned this camera since July 2013, I can safely say that it's the perfect companion to bring with you on those days when you don't want to lug around a DSLR or want to use it as backup. Shoot anything in broad daylight at ISO 80 or in low light with a tripod, and the image quality is practically indistinguishable from that of a DSLR. Lowlight performance is more than satisfactory, thanks to its fast F1/4 lens and large sensor. For the first time, I was able to get perfectly usable handheld shots in some areas where other cameras have struggled, such as the dimly lit interiors of churches.Okay, so if I'm giving the LX7 rave reviews, why the minus one star? I have used nearly a dozen cameras over the past three decades-- film cameras, SLRs, DSLRs, micro 4/3rds, the whole gamut. This is the first camera I've ever struggled to get a handle on in terms of layout and buttons. This is bizarre, considering that I've owned two Panasonic digital cameras in the past. In fact, a key factor in why I purchased the LX7 was that I was confident that I'd be able to master it in no time, with the idea that it would have more or less a similar layout as the previous Pannys I owned.Wrong. I don't know if this was simply a design choice or one determined by how the camera was put together, but the LX7 is laid out like a DSLR. This has resulted in one of the most frustrating user end experiences I have ever had with any camera. Because the Panny is a point and shoot, my brain registers it as a point and shoot. Since it registers it as a point and shoot, naturally, when trying to change certain settings, it keeps wanting to either press a few buttons and scroll through a few options, or turn the dial. No matter how much time I spend with this camera, I have to keep reminding myself over and over again to keep pretending it's a DSLR, as all the features are laid out as if it were one. Focus modes--like manual, AF, and macro-- are on the barrel. So is aspect ratio. You can imagine how confusing and frustrating it is, after years of instinctively accessing through an onscreen menu, to have to manually adjust them on the camera's body instead.This issue aside, the LX7 is a terrific camera all around for prosumers who've been disappointed by the endless run of cameras that are long on megapixel count and zoom but short on everything else. If you don't mind having only 3.8x optical zoom or 10.1 megapixels, you'll be more than happy with this camera because of its amazing image quality and robust low light performance.ADDENDUM (4/9/14): I have been taking tons of shots with this camera and I am officially in love. Pictures are eye-wateringly amazing for a point and shoot, and photos with above average low noise levels and minimal blur can be taken hand-held.

In this time I have also used Canon S90 and S100, and Nikon DSLRs.First off, I think it's funny how the features that camera companies market as being the big selling points for their products differ to the reality of what is actually great or mediocre about them. With all the buzz-words Panasonic and others throw around with each release, it becomes a challenge to parce out what's really new or meaningful for this model compared to previous ones, and its competitors. That said, here are for me the main selling points of the LX7:What I like: - The lens. Unbeatable f/1.4-2.3 max aperture range, with 24mm wideangle! That is a full stop brighter across the zoom range compared to the LX5, and unmatched by any other compact zoom camera. - Noticeably improved autofocus speed compared to LX5 (even after the LX5 firmware upgrade) - Noticeably improved shot-to-shot lag time, as well as shutter-button-press-to-capture lag time - Nice, 920k-dot LCD screen - The multi-aspect sensor. Introduced in 2008 with the LX3, this continues to be one of the great (and under-appreciated) features of the LX series. Enables 24mm wideangle at every aspect ratio (except 1:1, which would likely make the sensor prohibitively expensive). - The electronic level is surprisingly useful, and should save me a lot of time in post-production just straightening the images. I leave it turned on pretty much all the time. - The ND (neutral density) filter is a welcome addition, especially given the diminished minimum aperture range. - Another oldie but goodie: Panasonic's Intelligent ISO. Automatically adjusts capture settings based on camera shake and focal length; very useful! I get more usable shots from my Panasonic LX-series cameras than I do with my Canon S-series cameras because of this feature. - The macro is very good on LX cameras, with extremely close focusing distances when zoomed out. - Marketing gimmicks: 3D (kinda fun, actually, if you can convert the files), time-lapse, HDR, panorama, high-speed video, 1080p video with stereo audio, aspect bracketing, multi-exposure night mode, some good burst modes for JPEG shooters, and some other nice features I'm not likely to ever use.What I don't like: - It's noteceably bigger and heavier than the LX5. - Relatively slow zoom in/out (same as LX5). Trade-off is that there is no mechanical noise during zoom in video recording (as in Canon S-series). Might prefer a mechanical zoom similar to Fujifilm's X10 and XF1. - No one likes the lens cap. Still. I bought one of those auto-folding ones from Amazon at the same time, so at least those sellers & manufactures will continue to see healthy sales. It's nice, but makes the camera seem even larger (and more difficult to fit in a pouch/pocket/etc. - I also hate the shoulder strap Panasonic seems to love to much, and echo others who have suggested including some kind of wrist or hand strap instead. I end up folding the shoulder strap and taping it into a neat handle that straddles the top of the camera; this is infinitely more useful for me (and safer to boot). - The dedicated aperture ring. I appreciate the attempt at adding additional external controls, but I would have preferred dedicated EC, ISO, or shutter speed to aperture. On compact cameras, there is little reason to shoot in aperture-priority mode, as the depth-of-field is going to be deep in just about any setting, so this is really just a big waste of a feature that could have been really useful. Of course, a multi-function ring would have been the obvious choice. Perhaps Panasonic wanted to save this up for the LX9? - To accommodate the aperture ring, the aspect ratio and focus dials on the LX7's lens barrel are smaller and closer to the camera body compared to the LX5. They are also harder to adjust, and are oriented in reverse to the LX5... not an issue in and of itself, but a minor annoyance from those upgrading from an older LX model. - Likewise, the mode dial takes more effort to turn compared to LX5. I imagine this change was implemented thanks to feedback from previous models saying that the mode dial was too easily bumped accidentally while the camera was not in use. Fine. That happened to me a couple times. But I miss not being able to easily change it with my thumb; now I need a thumb and forefinger to adjust the dial while I hold the camera with my other hand. And in fairness, the dial now protrudes slightly more. - Panasonic effectively replaced the LX5's Focus button with a White Balance button, which is fine, but they also removed white balance from the quick menu, which I find annoying. - Cannot delete image after capture in image review... seriously? I consider this a bug. Would also be nice to scroll between images in image review mode. - Still relatively slow buffer--not for shot-to-shot, but shot-to-playback. - Poor color rendition (Adobe RAW defaults, compared to larger-sensor cameras) - Menu is more attractive than predecessors, but still tricky to navigate, and cannot be navigated quickly. There is also no in-camera help. - Image quality not the greatest; effectively unchanged from predecessors. Panasonic actually uses a smaller sensor in the LX7, presumably in order to accommodate the bright lens. A fair trade. - Slightly shorter battery life compared to LX5. Granted, the LX5's battery life is pretty solid (for a compact), and on the LX7 I think it's still solidly above average. My guess is it's the drain from the hi-res screen. Another fair trade. One nice thing, however, is that the LX7 and LX5 use the same batteries. I wouldn't mind, however, a much larger battery, as there's room for the hand grip to extend thanks to the protruding lens. - No GPS. I like having this option on my S100, but it does take a toll on battery and camera size. - Panasonic's mystifying folder hierarchy and file naming conventions. Would be nice to be able to browse a cleaner card, and customize file-naming convention (but one that makes more sense would be a good start).Don't let that long list of cons scare you; it's always easier to come up with things that aren't perfect than things that genuinely please you. It's just a heads-up for things that may or may not bother you, as well as a hint to Panasonic for things they should work on for the LX9.Before I bought the LX7 I was also considering Fujifilm's X10 (or its future successor), the more compact XF1, or nothing at all. I really love what Fujifilm is doing with their stylish, retro designs and innovative controls built around very capable compacts that supposedly product stunning JPEGs but lousy RAW images (due to their maverick sensor designs). Check 'em out. In all honesty, I might not have upgraded if it weren't for a momentary, massive price drop on the LX7 (others have mentioned that Amazon's price for this camera tends to fluctuate). But now that I've got it, I'm pleased with the progress Panasonic has made, and sold my LX5. It's a pleasure to use compared to the S100, which I might sell also, except that its size lends itself better to sticking into a small bag for \"just in case\" occasions.At the end of the day, the Panasonic LX7's shining star is its bight lens. Add to that a nice screen and faster operation across the board, along with everything the LX series already had going for it, this camera's a real winner.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you are willing to put in a little care and work, this is an AMAZING camera.", "Author": "Jay Doraiswami", "ReviewID": "R24JSIKLKV6W47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You can move much further along the photography scale with this camera.

The other area it excels is minimal shutter lag.  It captures and shoots much faster than any other camera I've used, so if photographing kids is your thing, it's a very good choice. The LX7 can be operated simply or manually, with more options than anyone will ever use, and the interface is pretty simple and intuitive.  It feels like a quality camera and responds like one.So why four stars? Tradeoffs.  It's not a DSLR and it can't match image quality with advanced interchangeable lense cameras. So if you are interested in making huge prints, there are better choices.  Additionally, zoom is limited compared to all of the powerful zooms that are available.

I've coveted the Lumix LX series for years and finally decided to take the plunge.  I'm so happy that I did!!I've always had issues with point and shoots since I generally shoot dSLRs or micro four thirds cameras.  Comparatively, the point and shoots have terrible image quality (which is pretty normal for a point and shoot), have frustrating shutter lag (like the Canon G9 I owned), or painfully low res LCD screens (like the Casio P&S;'s I've owned).  They can also have issues with being too bulky (like the Canon G series), or have a very slow lens that looks really soft when fully zoomed in.  In general, I'd rather pay 2x-4x the price of a good P&S; to get a better camera.The LX7 is not perfect but it's far and away the best point and shoot I've ever owned.  The LCD is good enough to give you a reasonable idea of the quality of your photos, so if there is something wonky, you can correct it right away.  This was NOT the case with most of the early P&S; digitals, and even some of the newer ones, like our Casio EX-FH100, which was otherwise a good camera but the LCD was so horrible you'd think you had taken horrible pictures because the screen didn't do them justice.  It's got pretty good response when pressing the release button and very little lag between shots.  So when I take snapshots of my toddler, my nieces and nephews, pets, or any rapidly moving subject, this camera does a very decent job of capturing the photo when you intend to.  It's not the smallest point and shoot, but it is far less bulky than most high end point and shoots.  The lens does not fully retract into the body, so it is a bit thick for a P&S.;  But compared to the Canon G series (or similar) this is very reasonably sized.Image quality is about as good as I've seen on a camera of this size and price.  It takes VERY nice photos.  I've used P&S; cameras that can't seem to decide where to focus, or they are unpredictable in how they will determine the correct exposure, so on those other cameras I'd have lots of underexposed or overexposed shots.  Not so with this camera.  It does a fantastic job with focus and exposure.The lens is bright and fast, which is FANTASTIC for taking snapshots indoors.  Makes it easy to get a good shot even if the light is less than ideal.  The only downside with the lens is that it only zooms to 3.4x, which makes it tough to photograph more distant subjects.  That said, unless you use this camera for specialized shooting, it's probably a reasonable tradeoff for most people.  The problem with reduced zoom is also mitigated by the high image quality.  Even if you can't zoom in that well, you can take the digital image and crop it significantly without too much loss in quality.  The lens also has a removable cap, which I think is not ideal, but otherwise not a real biggie for me.Overall I can highly recommend this camera.

The image quality is good and there is NO clicking during video recording.  The AVCHD format is a bit tough to transfer to PC and requires a few extra steps.

The crucial factors are the 24mm equivalent zoom, RAW, a hot shoe, and a very fast lens. The difference between 24mm and 28mm may not sound like much, but it's often the difference between usable and unusable in interior shots. (24mm gives you a view angle of about 84 deg while 28mm is good for about 74 deg).The hot shoe allows you to mount either a strong flash (with suitable light modifier) or a wireless transmitter to trigger strobes. The Panasonic DMW-FL360 External Flash (GN36) for Panasonic L1 DSLR and FZ50 Digital Camera is a good flash that integrates closely with the LX7. For architectural work, however, a strong manually-set flash is all you need, and substantially cheaper.Most people like the auto settings the LX7 chooses, while some don't, but it's basically irrelevant for architectural imaging, where you almost always want to shoot a series of RAW images spaced 1.33 or 1.5 EV apart over a total range that may, in some cases, need to be as great as 11 or 12 EV. The LX7 makes this easy in manual mode.You can get even better results with a modern dSLR or micro 4/3 body paired with a fast 24mm lens -- particularly in terms of lower noise and finer detail in dark areas. But a 24mm lens as fast as the LX7's is going to set you back something like $2,000. And of course the result is not as portable.One of the features of the LX7 that can be pretty useful for quick shots in many circumstances is its HDR mode. It won't match what you can do by shooting a RAW sequence over a broad dynamic range and processing them in ACR 7 and Nik HDR Efex 2, but it's vastly faster and often does a remarkably good job.For exteriors (and landscapes) the LX7 makes it reasonably easy to mount a polarizer. It's worth spending the extra for the Panasonic digital camera options PL filter DMW-LPLA37 because it has a particularly low profile that minimizes any risk of vignetting at wide angles.The LX7 may or may not be the best compact for general photography, but it's definitely a very good one. For me that's a bonus on top of its wonderful performance for architectural photography.*  *  *Added: I see that people express frustration with the the price of the Panasonic digital camera options filter adapter Kit DMW-FA1 and the difficulty of installing it. There are solutions. I got EzFoto 37mm filter adapter ring & Chamois Cleaning Cloth for Panasonic Lumix DMC LX-7 Leica D-LUX 6, replaces Panasonic DMW-FA1 Filter Adapter, which does the job well for much less money.

The problem is that it's all but impossible to get a good enough grip on the small, smooth protector. The solution is a rubber grip pad, such as Fox Run Rubber Jar Opener.

The auto focus is instant and unlike the cheap compacts there is absolutely no shutter lag. Also it is capable of 11 pictures a second in burst mode which is nice for capturing kids running wild. It can shoot raw which can really help if you use post processing software. I recently began using light room and am amazed at how much detail it can recover from an over or under exposed image. If you're not post processing yet i strongly encourage to do so and to shoot RAW.Just a quick update. The camera went on sale for $300 a few days after i purchased it.

Their customer service is why I buy almost everything from Amazon.Also I was a little dissapointed with the low light performance until i realized that i had accidently turned on the ND filter which lowers the light by about 3 stops. Once i read the manual and figured out what i had done wrong it's been working very well. While my dslr can still take better pictures this is an enormous step up from any compact camera i have ever shot.Update 3/1/2013I noticed that the White Balance selection is not that great on this camera... this is comparing it to my nikon which is excellent at it. This can be corrected in post processing as long as you shoot RAW. For me it does not take away anything since I don't mind post processing, but if someone only shoots JPG i could see how this would matter much more.Update 10/8/2013I have made the decision to sell the camera. I enjoyed using it for a number of months and I captured some really great photos with it, but in the end it just did not live up to my IQ standard. I still think that for the money the IQ is excellent, but I plan on purchasing the fuji x100s which is 4 times more expensive and justifiably has much better IQ.

I loved that Leica so I figured I'd replace it with the newest, improved model, the D-Lux6.  Having read all the comments over the years I thought I'd compare it to this Lumix.  I'm the type of person who would normally go for the \"better\" model, but in this case it was a no brainer.  As I compared the 2 side by side I couldn't see how it made any sense to go for the Leica as the two cameras are virtually identical.  There may be some aspect that the Leica has internally.. I read all of the reviews that compare the two and still can't pinpoint what the difference actually is, if any. As a layman, if there is a differnce, it's not compelling enough to warrant spending double the price (about an extra $400) for it.  With the Leica you do get an external software program license included (Adobe Lightroom 5) which I wouldn't use anyway... I'm talking about the difference in the hardware.I've heard that the Leica and Lumix are made in the same factory.  Let's put it this way... they have to be made by the same company or one would be suing the other... just look at the two side by side... same exact camera.  They just use different fonts with their markings... and the Leica has a bit smoother feel when moving the knobs, which I prefer, but not a biggie and only noticed when comparing side by side to the Lumix.  So I went for the Lumix and have been very happy with it.I've had the Lumix for about 3 months... the photos are fantastic. Works very similar to my old Leica D4 but the photos are better... operates faster... small things you'd expect with a \"new and improved\" model.  Assume that the Leica 6 would be also amazing (and better than my old 4)... just more expensive.Yes, I tollerate the same issue as I had with my Leica... having to remove the lens cap manually to shoot a photo... but I love the quality of the camera and the great photos so much that I put up with it.For the price, this camera is unbelievable.

Easy to get into action and back into my camera pouch (an M-Rock 2010 Mesa Verde \u2014 perfect if you install an auto lens cap on the camera!). When I'm above tree line, the panorama feature is awesome! HDR works nicely, too. Great in-camera functionality. Love the aperture ring and the aspect ratio (?) ring. One quibble with it, though, is that I found that I had bumped the aspect ratio and not realized it, and was taking 16:9 stills when I wanted 3:2. I almost would rather that be a setting in the menu, and use the ring for something more useful (I really don't find myself changing aspect ratio all that often at all).Raw feature is great, battery life is excellent (took a couple hundred photos and reviewed a lot in playback, over 12,000ft elevation, battery still going strong).

For home videos or travel videos the quality is superb (with the right settings), and the low light 1.4 lens is great for low light conditions indoors, around the house.  I was pleasantly surprised how it destroyed the RX100 in smoothness, color, and most importantly the professional look of the videos.  I also own a hacked GH2 for video.  The GH2 is probably considered outputting the BEST video quality under $4,000, rivaling neck and neck with probably the high end Canon Mark II/III.  So, my standards are quite high.  Obviously not the same class as the hacked GH2, the LX7 is really a solid choice for home video, or casual use, and in my opinion, outputs much better skin tones, color distribution, and clarity compared to the frustrating RX100.So, although the LX7 is not as good in the image department compared to the RX100, and is a little bit bigger, it does provide excellent results in BOTH photos and videos. The LX7 has replaced my GH2 + $1000 12-35mm lens for casual video, and takes pretty good quality images for me to decide enough was enough with the RX100 video output.

To those that are not so familiar with the numbers \"F/1.4-2.3\", what that means is the lens lets in lots of light which keeps the shutter time low, and add to it the excellent stabilization, you can take blur free shots almost all the time.Ok, when I said King of low light, I have to tell you that I have not used any camera that costs more than $500 (I wish I could try a RX100 sometime).  Neither have I tried any sensor bigger than 1/1.6Fast fast fast.  _BOTH_ focussing and shooting.  Something in addition to the low shutter time seems to make this camera shoot so fast fast.  Especially shots in succession like in auto bracketing or in the built in HDR mode.  May be a big internal buffer or something.  Auto-focus is extremely quick (I think more so in the AF tracking mode).Like the C1/C2 custom modes (four of them).HDR scene mode (see some remarks on it at the end).Cons:-----This one - I am really really annoyed with.  You cannot use the timer (2/10 sec) option when doing auto exposure bracketing.  They put both of them on the same menu which is insane in my opinion.  When you do auto bracketing you normally have the camera on a tripod, and have a timer option so the camera shoots the 3 shots after a small delay by which the camera has stabilized.  This is important because you want the 3 shots to be perfectly aligned.  It may not be fair to knock off two stars for this reason from an excellent camera, but I guess people may specifically read 3 star reviews and I want them to know about this issue in advance.  Had I been aware of this, I may not have purchased it.PANASONIC, please fix this with a firmware release making it a near perfect camera.LATER EDIT:  I have come to forgive this to some extent since I can align the multiple shots in software.  The problem still exists though if the exposure time is not going to be fast...This one annoys me a lot, but does not affect any functionality.  When in review/play mode you have 15 seconds (non customizable) before the lens will retract.  I often seem to easily pass that limit while inspecting shots, and hence the lens keeps moving back and forth and the motor whirring.  Why such a big hurry designers?  30 seconds (or a customer option) would have been so much better.General remarks:----------------The S95 paled in comparison to this in indoor low light shots, especially when zooming in (even a bit) because the S95 lens quickly becomes slower as you zoom.The lower battery life (compared to the LX5) is very noticeable.With almost every SD card, the camera said \"This card was formatted by an external device and is not suitable for recording\".  However it continues to record to the card.  May be camera prefers the card to formatted by the camera so it can perform better - if that is the case, please display a non-confusing message.The wide angle lens is very nice.  But I don't know if it is working against my needs.  When I am shooting indoors/kids at F/1.4 (wide end) from a few feet away, I have so much other junk in the frame and the subject occupies only a small portion of the frame.I like the fact that the tripod socket is not obstructing the SD card/battery cover.  So I can leave the tripod base plate on it permanently if needed.  However I do not see using this camers on a tripod at all, for reasons that it is plenty fast and the auto bracketing feature (requiring the tripod) being crippled by the timer issue I mentioned.The build in HDR is nice and I was really looking forward to seeing/using it.  However it does not give you any control over ISO, +/- compensation or anything.  And if you use in low light it will end up using a high ISO to keep the shots fast.  Overall it does give better pictures in some situations and is a very nice bonus feature, but having no control over what it did fell short of my expectations.  The S95 has HDR too, but it will ask you to put the camera on a tripod and you better obey.  No tripod required for the LX7, shoots 3 shots so quickly even handheld, and gives a good final result.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy With Purchase", "Author": "Linda Collins", "ReviewID": "RQ9RI5R4677UQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera arrived timely and well-packaged.

Used to larger format DSLRS and medium format film cameras,  I am amazed at the quality of the LX7's images. I have a series of 12X18 prints that I've framed that are outstanding. I believe that 16X20's would have been possible.  Its imaging quality far exceeds what most people will be asking of it.Just a few of the pros:-Very fast 1.4 lens with wide 24mm (35mm equivalent) lens.  Leica sharp!  Modest  but usable zoom range for inside applications. Very good noise control.  Shoot at 800 ISO without worry.  1600 if you really need it.  In most home situations with fast lens &  800 speed no need for flash.-Very good JEPG's right out of the box.  But plenty of features to allow DSLR type of control. RAW available.-Useful zoom features that allow you to program stops a various focal lengths and a return to last used zoom position when turning on the camera.- Special effects filters that are actually useful. Aspect control and f-stop control on the lens barrel.This camera is  small, palmable, but not really a pocket camera.  It does does not have the megapixel rating of some of the new cameras, but it is an excellent balance of image quality given the size of the sensor.  Too many megapixels on a small sensor can lead to noise issues.  Panasonic understands this and couples a sharp lens, reasonable number of megapixels, and good image processing software to produce a camera that is first rate. I suspect  that with the competition touting more megapixels and larger sensors that this little camera may not be around for too much longer.  At its current price and given its quality of construction and image quality, it's a steal!There is only one thing that really offers an improvement to the existing package and that is a separate optical viewfinder.  Panasonic  offers one but I chose the Olympus VF-1.  An optical veiwfinder fits in the flash shoe on top and provides a wonderfully bright and useful way for you to frame your images, especially out of doors.

Before I purchased this, I had only used point and shoot digital and film models. When I was camera shopping, I was specifically looking for something that was relatively compact and could take good low light pictures. Based on various customer and magazine reviews, this one seemed to have what I was looking for and enough manual features to play and grow with.So far, I am very happy with the purchase. I have yet to really explore its features but here's what I've noticed so far: -- excellent low-light, most pictures can be taken without the flash; -- takes nice macro photos with minimal depth of field or defocused background -- variety of settings including aperture-priority; shutter priority; manual setting; and various other settings. -- seems to produce accurate colors.The few things that I dislike are (1) its kind of bulky and heavy (2) cap over lens and (3) expensive accessories (I plan on purchasing an extra battery and lens protector which are about $40 each).FYI--If you want to use a 37mm screw on filter for this camera, you'll need to order the filter adapter first and you'll probably need to order it from Panasonic since I don't recall seeing it being offered through Amazon. Another hassle with this is that the adapter is often on backorder. Perhaps there are other companies besides Panasonic which offer a filter adapter for this model and I would also suggest checking for this.Overall, I would recommend this camera to someone that wants the flexibility that the manual controls provide but doesn't want to commit to a larger or more expensive camera.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Panasonic LX7 Photographer Compact Camera review by Dale", "Author": "Dale Thorn", "ReviewID": "R3HUY7Y0HE411E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic LX7 is often described as a photographer's compact camera because of the sophisticated and professional controls it has. Manual aperture and shutter, manual focus, aperture priority, shutter priority, neutral density filters, same-perspective image formats, etc. The look and feel of the LX7 doesn't hurt either. I have the white version, which is a metal body that has what looks like a semi-glossy enamel-type coating. The camera has a raised rubberized grip on the front, but it doesn't feel natural to me because of the small size of the camera, so I hold it like any small camera, with thumbs underneath, forefingers on top, and a wrist strap (not supplied) on my wrist.The LX7 is a beautiful camera with a high quality build, and feels very dense. No doubt the large lens contributes to the 10.5 ounce weight, and also to the 2.2 inch thickness. Both of those factors disqualify the LX7 as a shirt-pocket camera, and in my opinion as a pants-pocket camera too unless you have some kind of safari pants with large heavy-duty pockets. Note that Panasonic warns that the LX7 is not dust-proof, so if you do carry it in a pocket, you should do so in a sealed or zippered carry case to prevent dust getting into the mechanism. I will be using the Leica D-Lux 6 carry case when it's available - in the meantime I'm using the 18709 case from the Leica X1. Panasonic's carry case is the old-fashioned \"journalist-photographer\" case, which might be OK for some uses, but doesn't look good at most social events.The lens is a Leica 'Summilux' design with 135-effective focal lengths ranging from 24 to 90 mm. Most importantly, the widest aperture is f1.4 at 24 mm, and f2.3 at the 90 mm focal length. Much mention is made these days about improved sensors for low-light shooting, but there's no substitute for good glass, and the LX7's lens is probably the best available in a camera this size. Zooming is available the normal way with a stepless (smooth) action, and using a camera setting you can step from 24 to 28, 35, 50, 70, and 90 mm. The lens cap is a separate piece and comes with a lens-cap \"string\" that can attach it to the camera body so it doesn't get lost. I've seen complaints about this lens cap design, but I like it and don't find it particularly inconvenient.One of the great features of the LX7 is the aspect selector switch on top of the lens barrel. What's important here is that the LX7 doesn't just chop off the top and bottom of the image when changing from the 4x3 to 3x2 format - it maintains the same angle of view. The LX7 uses 10 megapixels (mp) with 4x3 aspect and slightly less in 3x2 and 16x9, but the wider aspects also use more pixels on the wider dimension since the sensor captures nearly 13 mp total. Almost needless to say, this requires a visual chart to explain - just google the words LX7 Aspect Ratio. On the side of the lens barrel is the selector for manual, auto, and macro focus. Macro focus goes down to one(1) centimeter, but when getting that close to a subject, the large lens is blocking much of the direct light, which might require a wider aperture resulting in a shallow depth of field (DOF). It may be necessary in such a case to put additional light on a macro subject, or shoot from a tripod.The LX7 has a video button on the top panel at the right side, which I've seen described as redundant since there's a video (motion picture) selection on the mode dial. It's not redundant. Until those separate buttons became common on digital cameras, I lost important beginning seconds in many video opportunities because the mode dial was set (usually) to Program mode. The monitor screen on the rear is typical of small cameras - it's clear and detailed and bright enough for nearly any shooting conditions. I've seen many commments about holding small digital cameras at arm's length to see the screen, presumably because older people don't focus close enough to hold the camera close. Being nearsighted, I mostly view the screen from 8 to 9 inches distance, but 3 to 4 inches is OK when I need to see smaller details. Since people who are not nearsighted typically use reading glasses for print, perhaps those would work with digicams as well.Many of the consumer digicams don't have good AF/AE (auto-focus/auto-exposure) selections, but the LX7 does. Other features such as minimum auto shutter speed and maximum auto ISO are becoming more common now, and are very handy for me, particularly the maximum auto ISO which I keep set at 400. Shooting some indoor scenes today with good outdoor light streaming in from a window, the camera chose 160 and 200 ISO for some of those images. I then set the ISO to 80 fixed and reshot some of the images, and the differences in noise can be clearly seen on the camera's monitor screen. The selectable built-in neutral density (ND) filters provide much greater flexibility in setting apertures and shutter speeds, but those really are professional options and most casual users will probably not use them. The LX7's built-in flash is good, as built-in flash units go, but nearly everything shot with flash looks better with external flash units, or white reflectors at the very least.I've read complaints about the tripod socket being on the end instead of more centered, but the obvious advantage is that it leaves the battery and memory compartment free so the tripod attachment doesn't have to be unscrewed when there's a need to change the battery. Since the LX7 is slightly heavy for its size, if the tripod attachment has a small enough surface, it might not be perfectly stable that way, and a better solution would be to find a tripod attachment with a larger surface under the 1/4 inch screw mount. Leica warns about attempting to use a tripod mount with a screw that's 5.5 mm or greater in length. Checking my own tripod, monopod, and ZipShot mini-tripod, none of those exceed 4.5 mm in length, so 5.5 mm screw mounts must be relatively rare or occur on specialized equipment.Camera forums are rife with complaints about the price of replacement batteries, and I always recommend carrying at least a second battery so shooting can continue if the first battery runs down. Contrary to what many people suggest - saving money with third-party batteries, I consider the price difference and if it's huge, I need to know why. Before I could even consider a very cheap battery, I would need several independent reviews that affirm the quality of that particular battery as well as the reliability of the manufacturer of that battery. On top of that, I would need to know that if their battery damaged my camera, they would pay to replace my camera promptly. Lithium-ion batteries can be very dangerous. If the price difference were less than my expenses in replacing a defective battery (packaging, shipping, time wasted, loss of battery for a period of time), I would certainly get the camera manufacturer's battery.Last but not least is the image quality. I will be placing images on my website (google my name) as time goes on, and my images there are average to worst case JPEG's processed in Paint Shop Pro v6 (ca.1999) rather than highly tuned RAW images processed in Lightroom or Photoshop. There are other websites that have or will have the optimized images, so mine will provide a good comparison as to what can be done with JPEG's and minimal (rotate, crop, lighten/darken) post-processing (PP). My experience so far says I can get good images up to ISO 800 in good indoor light at various public events, if I reduce the camera's internal noise processing and process the noise externally using Noiseware, DeNoise etc. software programs. Using the camera with defaults and no PP noise reduction, I'd say don't go higher than ISO 400 indoors or in flat lighting unless you're OK with the noise level.Many experienced users will learn the complex settings until they become second nature, and thus get better images as a result. Other users will stick with full automatic ('iA' on the mode dial). I work in between those, using 'P' (Program) on the mode dial, which sets the aperture and shutter automatically, but uses the settings I've configured in the camera's menus. Where I deviate from 'P' is when I choose 'S' for shutter priority - photographing surfers I typically set the shutter to 1/250 second or higher. I may use the 'A' setting also, for example if shooting a macro from very close up, to increase DOF so the entire object is in focus.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best compact camera for balance of features & price", "Author": "M.

I've had it about a month and it works very well.  The faster lens (1 stop faster), longer reach (90mm equivalent rather than 60mm), better movie capability, and aperture ring all are things I frequently use.  Image quality is at least as good as the LX3, and the LX7 gives me greater ability to have the background out of focus for portraits or macro shots.  Build quality feels as good at the LX3, the control layout is better (for example, I like the preview as a button rather than as a sliding switch as on the LX3), and the metering is consistently good.I also use a Canon T2i, and of course the Canon has the advantages that a larger sensor can provide.

(I usually don't shoot at 12,800, I just wanted to see what they'd do)And all this was just straight out of the box before I adjusted all the settings, and there are a LOT of settings, you can take a picture in full auto or any other way you want with lots of creative modes, scene modes, and programmable modes too.It has an F1.4 lens, so you can get great bokeh.It'll focus down to 1cm in wide-angle.The hot shoe will fire my Canon flash, so I don't need to buy the Panasonic flash.This camera takes totally awesome pictures.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big lens", "Author": "fair review", "ReviewID": "R3ULK3E3ZOWIX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The lens lets in significant light, allowing natural light photography in so many marginal lighting situations that it can become a go-to piece of equipment whenever it gets dim.

While Nikon's offerings in P&S; are not on par and that some other alternatives (those I like, such as the Sony RX100 or Fujifilm X10), are above my budget, I opted for an LX7.Although I already knew the dimensions before I made the purchase, I was still shocked to see how big it was.  By volume, an LX7 is a full 200% the size of S100, but holding in your hand it feels even larger because of the lens component intrusion.  I used to carry the S100 in a small pouch on my belt.  That's no longer an option.  This is a huge drawback, as they say the best camera is the one you have with you.  There is no way I can carry this camera with me to meetings, classes, and conferences.  I can only comfort myself that cell phones are catching up in terms of optical capacity.What I do not like, comparing to Canon S series: 1) No GPS; 2) This tremendously larger camera comes with an even (tiny little bit) smaller sensor and significantly fewer pixel counts; 3) The big exposure ring looks cool, but is not as ergonomic as the little front wheel found in Canon S.  In addition, it's not programmable.  The inevitable mechanical clicking sound could be a deal breaker under certain scenarios; 4) The lens cap! 5) The menu can't be more confusing; 6) This camera can really benefit from a lens hood at all time.  In other words, this design mandates a stay-on lens hood.  Panasonic engineers should figure out a way to make it happen; 7) The rear wheel and the battery switch feel flimsy.  The four directional buttons are tricky to fumble with; 8) There is literally no good case for this camera, not even the Leica Case for DLUX 6.What I like, also comparing to Canon S series: 1) faster focus; almost instantaneously right on; 2) writing to storage card seems to be parallel to normal operation.  There is little delay between two shots; In auto mode, the camera intelligence seems to be reluctant to go above ISO 400, which is a good call to my taste; 3) Manual focus works well, what a nice surprise! 4) The hand grip; 5) Much closer distance for close-up; 6) Easy access to an intuitive AF/AE lock; 7) The level gauge comes handy, really helpful; 8) Everything else people had praised about, such as the fast lenses, the hot shoe, etc.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "first in class", "Author": "Roger M.

There are 2 things I look for in a camera: 1) sharpness and 2) ability to make beautiful pictures. Everything about a camera (maximum aperture, image processing, lens) contribute to both qualities.1) Sharpness. Images from the LX7 are sharp but noticeably less sharp than those of the RX100. I think a number of factors each contribute slightly to this. The 10mp is the first. The next is the lens seems to have slightly less resolution and contrast. The sensor size is very small, much smaller than that of the RX100. I think this adds a small amount of noise to the images. These are the LX7's disadvantages when compared to the RX100, or I should say the RX100's advantages over the LX7.2) Beauty. It is in the eye of the beholder. When I compare the images of the LX7 and the RX100 the ones from the RX100 just look better to me. Not only are they crisper the colors are more lifelike. Perhaps \"lifelike\" is the best way to describe it. It's the complex interplay of all factors which results in images that look great. The larger sensor size of the RX 100 also makes it capable of shorter depth of field, allowing its F1.8 to knock the background out of focus better than the LX7's F1.4.The RX100 has clear advantages over the LX7, however it costs a lot more. Ultimately, I bought the LX7.I needed something small and light that I can carry around and also something convenient for indoor use at home. For travel I often need something capable of low light photography and something a bit wider, and the LX7 serves that purpose. For home use I often need something I can just whip out to photograph a fleeting moment, whereas my NEX-7 usually has some lens on it that I have to swap out.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice - For a compact camera - but not when compared to a DSLR", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"MontWat\"", "ReviewID": "R36SXL94YB88Z0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a Canon T4i.

I previously owned the Panasonic Lumix TZ5, so I already had a good feel for the camera. I have been taking twilight, night, and indoor shots, hand-held, with pleasing results. I might not even need to use my tripod - well, for those 5 second and longer night shots. Just don't think you can put this in a shirt pocket, it has some thickness to it. Be sure to use the lens cap strap or you will certainly misplace it, but it's not a big deal to use a removable cap - all the big DSLRs have them, right?This camera has a dedicated aspect ratio dial which makes it easy to play with the square format, something I've liked when using medium format film. I have also played with the Creative Control Modes, something I've never bothered with before, and also shooting multiple exposures - I'm now addicted and always have to try a few.

I own a Sony DSC-HX100V and a Canon SD870IS  both cameras are OK, but the Sony has poor low light performance and the Canon is too old to compare fairly to today's cameras.  So I had bought the Sony DSC-HX9V, but it is almost identical performance to the DSC-HX100V, so I decided to sell it and buy the Panasonic LUMIX LX7  instead, which is about the same size and type of camera, but with much better performance for my needs.  Just last night I took some pictures at a family dinner and used both the Sony DSC-HX100V and my new LX7.  The difference is like night and day.  I was not expecting such great results, but I was amazed at how natural the skin colors are and how great it captures light in low light shooting ( not dark, but indoors and at night )  Being a Sony fan I wanted the RX100, but when they dropped the price of the LX7 a couple of weeks ago, I decided to give this GREAT camera a try and boy am I glad I did.  Best camera for the money and compared to the RX100, the LX7 takes nicer pictures for my use.  Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to take DSLR like images with a compact solid camera.

After using for it about a week and trying it out in every scenario I can, I came to hate my decision... The low light performance is great don't get me wrong, it's the 'everything-else' that I had issues with.  In every other scenario, the RX100's performance was mediocre at best and most of the images produced I was actually able to duplicate and in some cases perform better with my very old Canon S3is.  Again, the ONLY area this camera performs great is in low low low light... The typical indoors at bar or at home performance of this camera is nothing to out of the ordinary and only shines in very low light settings... I mean candle light levels is the only time RX100 shines versus other advanced compacts.  I returned the Sony RX100 for full money back (up to14 days in perfect condition at the store I bought it from).  Lastly.. I am never one two review a picture camera for its video performance, but this cameras video shooting capabilities were not bad... not great but not bad either.  The tripod hook on the bottom of the camera is in the WORST position imaginable... it effectively cuts off the power ports on the bottom of the camera when using a tripod...the limitations of no EVF is just sad for this price level of a camera as well.I than purchased the Panasonic DMC-LX7 from Amazon for MUCH cheaper than the RX100 and began my rigorous testing for the week ahead of me.  I was very pleased first of all with the feel of the camera as it felt solid in my hands and the rubber grip made it feel much more comfortable to hold with one hand.  The quality of the photos produced in by this camera far surpassed my expectations and in all but very very very low light levels, beat the RX100 by miles. Having said that, the f1.4 lens on this camera is amazing in low light and takes extremely sharp and clean pictures, even in very low light conditions.  In regular indoors and outdoor conditions, I can easily say that this camera far surpasses any other advanced compact I have tried.  It even performs better in some cases than my Canon T3i DSLR.  The brokeh of the f1.4 lens on this camera is just awe inspiring  awesome. the sharpness and the details of the pictures produced are just amazing.  I bought the EVF as well for this camera and use it most of the time and and extremely grateful that Panasonic has this option. the battery life is pretty good to average for cameras in this range, it felt that the RX100 and this camera exactly the same in fact.  The macro performance was again, much better in DMC-LX7 vs the RX100.  on top of all the areas that this camera is amazing, it even has a built in ND filter which performs amazingly.  With the ND filter and the 250sec exposure time (the highest by far in this range of cameras.) I was able to produce some of the most stunning pictures I ever produced.  Some I would even dare to compare to Nikon D4.... With the ND filter, I was even able to produce very long exposure shots in daylight conditions... Again, I am not much for video reviews of picture cameras, but I can't leave this post without mentioning the amazing performance of the 120fps full HD video in this camera.  The videos produced are amazing quality and you even get a full spectrum of manual controls while in video mode!.  The high speed video is HUGE plus for this camera as well and the quality of the video is comparable to most $500 range video cameras. All in all, this camera is far far more than the listed price of $449.00 with its amazing performance of the f1.4 lens and the ND filter and the 250 sec exposure time.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this camera so much!!", "Author": "Pablo", "ReviewID": "R1KGC6RZ0T24BF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a complete noob regarding photography but i wanted to step up a little from my old Lumix-FP8 without getting inro DSLR.This camera has tons of features, takes superb pictures and if you put some time on it you can achieve incredible shots.I am really in love with the aperture control ring that makes really easy to get your blurred background images or sharp panorama shots.There is too much to say about this camera and i dont think i can cover everything in this review.

Controls are very logical if you rely on manual settings. It literally takes just a couple of seconds to set up the aspect ratio of the shot, aperture and ISO (all of the three during those couple of seconds - amazing). The lens is very nice: the focal range is very useful, it is very fast and actually more than useable wide open. Optical stabilization works well. It is not as good as in the best cameras, but it definitely helps at longer shutter speeds. Manual focus is available and easy to use.Video features are quite good, probably one of the best among photocameras. LX7 is capable of shooting 60 frames per second at 1080p resolution. Full manual controls are available in this mode (aperture, shutter, ISO), the aperture and shutter priority modes are also present. There is some moire present (no color moire though). Subjectively the video appears sharp and only careful examination shows that the camera seems to have only half the resolution in the vertical direction (the smallest details, the thinnest lines are never smaller/thinner than two pixels in height). The camera has a very interesting feature: it is capable of shooting 720p video at 120fps for more than 7min. There are 3 issues in this mode though.1). The only controls available in this mode are \"Start recording\" and \"Stop recording\". It would be nice to be able to set the shutter speed.2). Moire is stronger than in 1080p mode from the same camera (again, I haven't seen any color moire).3). The video appears to have some motion blur. When I was inspecting individual frames, I noticed that every frame contains some faint copy of the previous frame. When watching at 30fps, this artifacts appear as slight motion blur.Photo quality is very good, as long as we are talking about the lens sharpness, but the sensor is just not that great. It is definitely better than the 1/2.3\" sensor in the cheaper cameras, but is much worse than the one in Sony RX100. Personally, I would prefer a camera with slower lens but larger and higher quality sensor.The camera is quite comfortable to hold. I don't think it's important because if you shoot less than 20-30 photos in a row and less than 300-500 a day, it is ok to hold a camera of any shape. However, for some users it is important, therefore I mention it. :)The camera is not quite pocket-able but this is the price one have to pay for the excellent lens.This camera is not the best in terms of image quality but it is extremely fun to shoot with it.

In short I feel the video taking performance is a lot better than the still image performance.LX7's video mode is among the best one can expect on a still camera although recording time is arbitrarily limited to 29 minutes.  It outperforms my 2 year old Sony mid-price camcorder in video quality and frame rate.  Now my Sony camcorder feels obsolete.  The only saving grace is the Sony's handling and recording time limit is the size of the memory card.  If video get any better than this on a still camera, the camcorder market will meet its demise.  I believe Panasonic knows this and is limiting the recording time on the LX7 to avoid cannibalizing its camcorder sales.Still image is where this camera falls short from an average user point of view and I will sound critical.  (When I read people's reviews I prefer to hear the critical opinion as well as the good points.)It is often marketed as a great camera for the point-and-shooters and more advanced photographers alike, but out of box performance using the iA mode yields subpar result to put it mildly.  The images lack contrast and color fidelity in this mode under any lighting condition, and they are often improperly exposed.  Skin tone appears very pale, resulting in unflattering portraits.  After painstaking fiddling and experiments with settings in PASM modes, the results were acceptable, but at the end I still had trouble getting consistently sharp and well exposed images with proper color.  The contrast and color on this camera are just not right no matter how much I played with settings.  I suspect this is a very frustrating experience for novice and intermediate users; I certainly was and I am not a novice.  It's too bad that the bright lens does bring lots of possibilities for users, especially under low light and its lightning fast focusing speed, but the programming on this camera seems not up to the task.It was my decision to buy this camera after reading lots of glowing reviews and I had assured my wife that this is the best performance we could get for the price.  It was very difficult to admit the flaws of this camera the first couple times I heard my wife's assessments of the images - they were not sharp and look very flat - our 12 year old Olympus C4040 took more appealing pictures with colors just banged on.  After much objective observations and experiments with settings, I eventually agreed with her opinions.  Back to the store where it belongs.If you have the patience and the experience of an advanced user, this camera may work for you.  Perhaps under the right shooting conditions and with the right settings, the performance can be as good as described from all the positive professional reviews.  But for an average user who is more often use it for everyday point-and-shoot and also wants to explore deeper into photography with all the available bells and whistles, I am disappointed and I don't get it.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful for videos and better than Canon S95 in everything", "Author": "Ashish Jain", "ReviewID": "R1QME4YX1ZXRQ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "About me: I am into photography for at least 15 years and have used many film and digital cameras. I consider myself as advanced amateur, i know how to use DSLRs into full manual mode, flash photography with speedlite and using Adobe photoshop. However, I am still one of those who don't understand the histogram :) ... in fact never tried to understand.Cameras used in last few years - Many P&S; including mega zoom Sony HX1 and currently possess Canon S95, Canon T1i & T4i DSLRs with multiple lenses. Also, kept Canon camcorder Vixia HF100 (sold sometime back).I am a father of 2 year old and developed reasonable skills in last few years in photo as well as video. I feel that i am reasonably placed to review a Camera like LX7.In very short words: Everything a Canon S95 can do, Panasonic LX7 can do better. PERIOD.Still want to read more into this lengthy review? :)Lets start from Video (since this is least covered in other reviews):I had a Full HD Canon camcorder Vixia HF100 (having 1/3.2 inch sensor) which was easily replaced by Canon S95 P&S; for video simply for wider angle and better low light capability. Canon S95 with 720p was better than my old camcorder with 1080p.S95 can not zoom optically while video and no continuous auto-focus. Recently purchased Panasonic LX7 which beats canon S95 on all fronts - Continuous auto-focus, amazingly clear videos in home under average light conditions, wide as much as 24mm, goes up to 90mm on telephoto side (zoom could be less for some people) and a very big aperture which starts at F1.4 at wide end and F2,3 at the telephoto end.Also, sensor size (1/1.7) is bigger than most of camcorders in market (typically 1/3 or less).I am not saying that LX7 is better than all non-pro Camcorders but yes, its better than many cheap camcorders. Camcorders are faster in focusing, faster to adjust to brightness of light and have more optical zoom. However, lot of camcorders under $500 are struggling from at least 1 of the following issues:1) Smaller sensors of size 1/4 inch or even smaller (1/3 or bigger is considered decent for a camcorder to give it a good low light capability). Personally, i will never purchase a camcorder with a sensor smaller than 1/3 inch even if you load of lot of features in them like projectors (typically Sony does so).2) Many of Canon camcorders have 1/3 inch sensor, amazing low light capability (probably not matched by LX7 but i believe comes close) but these Canons start at disappointing 43mm at wide end which makes them useless for use at home with my kid. If you must buy camcorder, consider some Canons like M50/500/etc.. and buy a wide angle conversion lens which itself is nearly $200. But again, they do frame capture rate of 24p recorded at 60i... i am not very sure about the issue here but looks fishy. I can convert my 60p video to 24p using software (i have adobe premiere but yet to learn). Every manufacturer wants to advertize 24p somehow.3) Some Panasonic camcorders have good size sensor and wide angle but still reviews says 'bad in low light' and they don't do 24p either.Panasonic LX7 beats not only Canon S95 but also Canon T4i DSLR with 18-135mm STM lens in low light conditions for video. Aperture starts from F3.5 on T4i's 18-135 lens which is really not good for low light. Canon T4i has better/clear audio than LX7 and S95. I am sure that T4i must be better for videos in good light conditions using 18-135mm STM lens (but never tried in good light). In good light, LX7 will not have aperture advantage over T4i.This is my observation by making a lot of side by side videos holding 2 of them together and filming same subject, later played back on 37 inch 720p HDTV (sorry, i don't have 1080p TV). Please note that your old computers might not be able to play the 1080 content nicely and colors might look dull.If you have more money for camcorder, you can look at Canon VIXIA HF G10 or high end sony camcorders (do compare the sensor size).Cons:1) White balance (this con applies to still pictures as well): You must learn to set the white balance correctly. Do little bit of learning to set custom white balance and save the custom balance (Set White 1 and Set white 2). You can also tweak the auto white balance to some extent to suit your shooting conditions. I do it to reduce the excessive yellows.Honestly, my first day use was an disappointment because of strong yellow cast in pictures and videos). This is the worst camera i ever used with such horrible auto white balance under certain conditions. However, it needs little bit of learning. I am no more effected by this issue due to some time spent in learning the white balance but wish it was better in auto like Canon S95.Note: I would have returned the camera if my primary use demanded the use of flash frequently. The white balance is horrible with flash (tested in indoor average lit conditions) and often results in strong pale colors in part of picture (uneven colors in foreground and background).2) The videos at highest resolution are done at 60p. It could have killed many high end camcorders if Panasonic had put the ability to do 24p. Doing 60p means that i should use a shutter speed of 120 (closest is 125 on LX7) respecting the 180 degree shutter rule. In practical terms, i lose one stop of light as compared to 24p in low light conditions. Some might not agree but its true that 24p is most preferred for videos to look smoother and happens to be most compatible format for playback on TVs, although most of sports/action is shot at 60p now a days.Still, videos are very bright & crisp with LX7, i could not have purchased any camcorder within $300 (price paid for LX7) having better quality as well as wide angle lens.3) Stereo microphone could have been better (as in Canon T4i) but still reasonable for its price and size.4)Some Maximum time limit (not sure how much)on videos although i never make any video even greater than 5 minutes but it can affect many users.5) Not pocketable - I knew it before buying and i never kept even much smaller Canon S95 in pocket. Yes, it will go into Coat pocket and that i how i carry it but plan to purchase a fitted case for it. Good thing is that there is minimal chance of accidentally switching-on in bag/pocket due to sliding on/off switch.6) There is a dedicated switch to change the aspect ratio for picture/video. I find it annoying. It could have been buried in menu and should have been independent for picture and video. I always want an aspect ratio of 16:9 for video and 4:3 for pictures. Having physical button means i should remember to change it when shooting video after pictures or vice-versa. I hate accidentally taking pics in 16:9 and videos in 4:3. Having it in menu and independent could be better. Any Pana designers reading this review?Now the still picture ability:Better than S95 mainly due to brighter lens on wide as well as telephoto side. The lens is actually usable at F/1.4 (not soft) and it has much less shutter lag than Canon S95. I disliked Canon S95 mainly for its high shutter lag while doing pics of my kid running/playing resulting into blurry pics.This camera has a hot shoe which is useless for me since i do all flash photography with my DLSR using speedlite and don't intend to make any investments here. It is nice to have for some people but i wish it was not there to make camera smaller/lighter.I purchased LX7 during holiday offers for $300. I feel that the Leica lens used in LX7 itself is worth the price i paid.The only camera which is a true competitor of LX7 is Sony RX100, comes at a much higher price (more than twice the price i paid for LX7) and its superiority over LX7 is still debatable.My wishlist - A camera of Sony RX100 sensor/size, Panasonic LX7's Leica lens, minimum 6x optical zoom, real 24p video, slightly better stereo mic, and in-built flash having ability to bounce by tilting vertically and rotating to sides. Should be priced with-in $500 to become the best seller and keep people like me interested. Am i asking for more ;)Hope this helps, feel free to ask questions or comment. Please be respectful.Update: 05-Aug-13After seeing a review my another member, i was thrilled to learn that LX7 can fire a canon speedlite mounted in hot shoe. I tried, YES, it can.... It fired my Canon 430 EXii. Next, i will be trying with Yougnuo RF triggers and update this review. (Disclosure: Canon 430 EXii becomes very top heavy with such a small cemara, holding LX7 with 430EXii mounted is really a punishment to hands ;)Update: 03-Apr-14My original review for Video remains unchanged. However, i must admit that for still pics i am not getting many keepers, lot of my pictures go to recycle-bin these days. My expectations from myself have increased and there is something i don't like about LX7 pics - probably not as sharp as i like, less resolution, more noise and haze. I am in market for new camera probably Fujifilm X100s but will not sell LX7 because of nice video which i shoot in indoor conditions with my little son, else i am not much into video stuff.I think that such a nice lens of LX7 is being wasted on a mediocre sensor. Panasonic should have used atleast 2/3 inch sensor (if not 1 inch like RX100) with 12 to 14 mega pixels to use this beautiful lens better. Dropping the rating to 4 stars. Overall, 3 stars for still pictures (still better than Canon S95), 5 for video.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Raw and Semi Manual, some negatives", "Author": "Chatoyer", "ReviewID": "R13OJA8U5U3D9S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really wanted to give this a 5, because this camera is great for me, and I love using it. However, there are enough small issues to dock a star, so I had to go to 4. Let's start with what I like I suppose. I personally like shooting in Raw and jpeg, as I like the option to post process. I also have the Micro Four Thirds system, with a few cameras (OMD, GF3, GX1(former), EPL1) and several lenses. The quality, bokeh, etc of this camera isn't the same as the m43s, but it is far better than a standard point and shoot or a camera phone. It has pretty acceptable noise up to ISO 800, and takes excellent photos. It's size is also good: while the lens does stick out a bit, I can fit it into most of my pockets, and when I can't, it can fit in a small unobtrusive belt pouch. Aesthetically I think it looks nice as well: I purchased the white one myself. At $300(which it goes down to from time to time) it's also an excellent price. The camera gives you very excellent manual controls, auto bracketing up to 3 shots at 3 EV(loved this for HDR), and several built in features. It has several custom modes that can be saved with full settings, which averts one of the negatives below.Now for the bad. I haven't used it much, but from what little I've used it, and from what I've read online, the iAuto of this camera is pretty bad. I've seen it reduce the shutter speed too low on occasion, and it probably has some other issues, or features I wouldn't normally use. I don't like iAuto, so this is fine for me, but some people want a point and shoot with minimal setup, and this may be an issue. This can be averted by using one of the custom modes and setting various settings and limits (such as minimum shutter speed, maximum ISO, etc etc). There is an excellent guide on youtube and dpreview about this. Continuing on, I also had issues with the flash. I had to manually adjust the flash compensation when using the flash at close distances; it was washing out faces at close portrait distance. Finally, higher ISO settings have unpleasant noise, high chroma and banding, which I couldn't remove as easily, and I haven't kept a shot above 800.Pros:Excellent Manual control (PASM, ability to set min shutter speed, and lots of other goodies)Quite good Intelligent Zoom, though I don't use this much.Very good image quality at low to midrange(800) ISO.Raw, I don't like shooting without itPrice: When it goes for $300 new, this price is excellent.Very fast lens throughout entire zoom range, great for low light shots.Good macro mode (I have this on my m43 in a better way, so it doesn't matter as much to me, but it's still nice, as close at 1cm focusing)Neutral Density filter is very useful, as it allows you to stay below f4(diffraction limit) in bright daylight. It also has a nice setting to choose how it is auto applied.Shot to shot is quick, high speed burst, fast focusingHot shoe for an excellent EVF(which I no longer have, but had for my GX1) as well as external flashes (man, it looksVideo seems great so far.Built in OIS is very nice, my minimum shutter speed is set to 1/15 and haven't had any issues.Neutral:Manual focus isn't what I'm used to, but it isn't bad either.Zoom speed takes a little longer, slowing down the otherwise stellar performance, but I didn't find it that much of an issue.The cap is a lens cap and not an auto. This can be fixed a bit with some 3rd party adapters, but I ended up preferring the lens cap anyway. It just looks better, and since it can just hang from the camera, it isn't that bad. It's sturdier than the auto lens cap as well. There is also a third party cap that will allow extending; I believe it requires the 37mm filter adapter.Cons:iAuto mode seems useless. I lack experience here, but what experience I had, I hated.The flash seems to require manual compensation adjustments, which seemed a bit buried. Maybe there's a way to assign it to Fn.High ISO(over 800) is full of Chroma noise and banding, making it difficult to use the pictures.So there you have it. If you want a point and shoot with out of camera jpegs only, this can be a problem. There are ways to fix it, but I don't think this is the best camera for you. High ISO noise is also an issue. I have yet to use the RX100, but it has better performance here from what I've seen. Some have stated the G15 has better ISO3200 noise performance too. However, if you use the settings right, this camera produces very excellent shots, is small, and is much cheaper (at $300 anyway) than competition(especially the RX100). It's a very handy additional/portable camera. It's also a great camera to come up from Point and Shoot, for those who want to learn some more manual control and be a bit more creative.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "What I expected.", "Author": "C.

I've read all comparisons between the RX100 and LX7, and I ended up buying this because of the price (USD 320 in Sept2013....half of the price of the RX100). I have to say, this camera is absolutely amazing. I've read many good things about the fact it has a bright an excellent f1.4 lens, but I didn't know how this would be in real shooting. The way this stuff handles low light is awesome. Pictures are sharp with low noise and beautiful color rendition. I shoot in JPG and RAW, but the JPGs are beautiful straight out of the camera.

An important feature and the major reason I decided to upgrade was the LX-7's excellent low-light capability based around its best-in-class f1.4 lens. I've used the LX-3 indoors without distracting and face-flattening flash to good effect but the LX-7's lens has another aperture stop i.e. twice the light grasp so I expect it to do even better.

But it still has some shortcomings, just to list few of them of mine (who is just a general average user).I mainly used it for food photography. It took good Macro shots with nice Bokeh. However, due to its fast lens (why I bought it for), it is hard to get a sharp focus (just like its predecessor, LX5, or the other fast lens alike), especially under the poor lighting. Although it was upgraded to the MOS sensor, but the size shrinks to 1/1.7\". Though it still takes good images, the image quality doesn't seem to improve any. I wish the post DMC-LX7 can have a bigger MOS sensor. Maybe that's why the DMC-LX7 seems to focus on the Soft Focus features (Soft Focus, Radial Defocus, Smooth Defocus, etc) instead of a Sharp Focus feature that every photographers want (at least that's what I want).DMC-LX7 comes with the Aperture Ring, which maybe a nice feature for some people. But I rather have a Manual Focus Ring instead of an Aperture Ring. It is VERY awkward to adjust the manual focus with a Focus Lever Dial, especially if you want to apply the Rack Focus while shooting the video.In addition, the sound of the adjusting the manual focus dial is recorded with the video. Don't think there is a way to turn on and off the sound recording. There is no sound recorded while shooting with the High Speed video mode. I wish the post DMC-LX7 can have that the options of turning on or off the sound recording, that it can shoot the action cam video, that the options of choosing the frame rates (fps) instead of \"A, S, P, High Speed\", and that it can make the real Time Lapse video instead of shots.The last, the lens cap!

I really like the Canon point and shoot cameras, which have produced very good pictures and the Canon software is very convenient for keeping track of which pictures have already been downloaded and placing them in a designated folder. I read all of the great reviews of both the LX5 and LX7, which convinced me to take a chance on the Panasonic LX7, especially since it came with a 1.4 lens, which is unheard-of for a point and shoot camera.Hear are the Pros of the LX7:* Very light and compact* Decent battery life* Very bright and clear screen* Takes pictures nearly instantly (lag time almost unnoticeable)* Very sharp and bright pictures, better than Canon, likely due to the 1.4 lens* Colors are as accurate as Canon (not perfect, but about a third requires some quick correction using photoshop color cast)* Videos look and sound as good as Canon (Like that you are allowed to take up to 30 minute videos, which is better than Canon)* HDR setting is convenient for producing more accurate lighting* Takes great pictures in low light, most likely due to the 1.4 lens (have not used the flash yet because of this)Here are the Cons of the LX7:* Manual lens cover is inconvenient, but OK since I am use to using the old film SLRs* Noticeable barrel distortion at wide angle (worse than Canon)* Software requires you to manually select which pictures you want to download, which is laborious when it is hundreds of pictures and you do not want to select all of them* Software does not download pictures unless you are logged in as administrator (most of the time I do not log in as administrator for security purposes)If it was not for the software inconveniences, I would have given this camera 5 stars.

My older cameras (Canon G5 and Casio Z750) both have poor low light performance. Neither camera could auto focus on a black cat with low room lighting. Both old cameras had very slow recovery between shots, especially if flash is used. The Lumix LX7 has none of these faults, this is the proverbial can take a pic of a black cat in a coal bin camera. It does everything I want a camera to do, very well. I have only owned my LX7 for month and still discovering all of the extensive auto and manual features.

I had previously purchased and returned ... an Olympus XZ-1 and I was ridiculed ...and accused of being a photographically ignorant individual because I expected a camera to take relatively good pictures consistently ....while simply relying on the program or \"intelligent\" program modes.I mostly wanted an upgrade to the Canon IS 700 I bought my wife about 6 years ago and spent a substantial amount of time before settling on the Olympus XZ-1.  In my review of that camera, I stated ...that I might have gotten a lemon..... and related the consistent underexposure which was worse with flash ...and related that I ultimately returned the camera when I could not even get  consistently good pictures setting a custom mode with exposure compensation of +.7 with flash and two f stops without.I was told ....I should use the histogram ...rather than expecting the camera to get a useful photo in one of the auto modes ...... I was told to use manual mode ....like most \"camera knowledgeable\" purchasers of the XZ-1 would do .....I was told that the picture on the OLED was not indicative of how the picture would look printed or on screen and therefore I should only shoot in raw mode and edit the results if I expected good pictures ......and the list of \"I should\" went on and on...I explained that I might wait until the XZ-2 came out and hope the metering issues I experienced were resolved.  I finally deleted my review because frankly the comments were becoming rather uncivil.Notwithstanding that I purchased the camera for my \"point and shoot expert\" wife ...I wanted a camera I could exert more control over in challenging or unique lighting situations .....I stated that I thought a good ...electronic  metering digital camera should take consistently good pictures without a histogram and in fact without an OLED screen which is truly for the purpose of composing the picture.My wife took pictures on a trip to Canada with her old Canon and the Oly Xz-1 ....the Canon pictures were ...consistently good ...the XZ-1 results were consistently underexposed.I was waiting ....and watching ever since I returned the XZ-1 ...vacillating between waiting on the XZ-2 ....taking a chance on the $650 Sony RX100 ...with a 28 mm wide angle vs 24mm .....with a lens that starts at f1.8 but ends up at f4.9 ......and without a hot shoe or accessory port ...hence no aux flash or viewfinder if needed ....I was also considering the Panasonic ...but I had never owned one ...(Canons ...all the way from F1 ....A1 ...EOS3 ...to the digital I bought my wife) ....and Panasonic  doesn't have a long history of building cameras....I also considered the new SONY NEX6 ...but to match the compact size of the XZ-1 ...I would need the pancake lens and have to forego the zoom ....or haul two lenses and switch between them.Having used manual and then programmable 35mm film cameras over the years....the most attractive feature of the digital cameras ...is the spontaneity of point and shoot .....which also meant compromised picture quality...I would probably still be shooting primarily 35mm on my EOS3 with my Metz 45-CL4 if you could buy and get the film processed conveniently.But...since I married an Asian lady.....I discovered another side benefit of digital cameras ....you don't have to process and print every single picture .....that is a point that may be lost on most American men that don't have wives of Asian descent.But...I digress.....the point of the review should be the LX7 ...so here it is ...It worked perfectly out of the box ....in both iAuto mode and program mode....the colors were good ....the pictures were not underexposed .....the low light ability of the f1.4 combined with  24mm wide angle are ....amazing ....it took my wife all of about \u00bd hour to conclude we were keeping this one (barring any electronic or mechanical catastrophe in the next few weeks)And this is just based on her initial \"point and shoot\" expertise.I have only snapped a few shots using the Aperture  mode at f1.4 and was equally amazed ......To sum up....the camera is great....at $299 ...it was an absolute bargain ...I had paid $270 for the XZ-1 before the price drop and would have been thrilled if it had worked as well in person as it sounded on paper....If you get the opportunity to buy LX7 at $299 again ...I would not hesitate...especially if you can get it from Amazon and have thirty days to try it or return it....I can pretty much assure you .....you will keep it. By the way ...this has a video mode that actually works ...versus the XZ-1 .....I probably should have had my wife write the review instead of me....she is much less wordy ...having come to the US from the Philippines....her English is quite good but she is much less verbose than I am.In fact ...I can sum up her review ....in three words ......... \"WOW\" ....and \"Holy Cow\" ....that's all she had to say!The only ...less than desirable ....point I will note...is the zoom is slower than on other cameras....but then....some of my other choices would not have even had a zoom to match at the size and pic quality I wanted.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "A decent performer, but not the head of the class", "Author": "Fotoman \"Fotoman\"", "ReviewID": "RO1ZUGOO4Y4WP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "FORWARD: Despite my best intentions with my original product review, many Amazonian faithful found issue with my approach in comparing it to another camera that I also purchased here on Amazon. My hope was to 1.) illustrate WHY I came to the conclusions I did instead of just saying so and 2.) to offer an alternative camera suggestion in the event that searchers wanted such an opinion. However, because we only have words here and true intention is sometimes misinterpreted, I've acquiesced to the flustered parties and redrafted my review to focus just on this camera and it's pros and cons alone. Undoubtedly others will still disagree with my opinions (they are opinions after all) on the camera for sure, but but suffice it to say, I've done my best to iron out the wrinkles that some found with my original review.AT THE END OF THE DAY, I SINCERELY HOPE YOU ENJOY WHATEVER CAMERA YOU PURCHASE, BE IT THE LX7 OR ANY OTHER.MY NEEDS: I wanted something with decent optics, a usable zoom range, decent low light performance (high ISO), a hi-res screen, accessory shoe and access to full manual controls. Pocketable wasn't a major criteria, but the big SLR-style super zooms were definitely out. My target budget was no more than $400 if I could help it.I considered several models, but at the end of the day the LX7 was one of the cameras I really wanted to try.COST: When I purchased mine in April 2013 the Panasonic had astonishingly dropped to an impressive $289 in the black body. It had been around $399. As of this redraft it's about $330 which increases the value (and therefore my overall rating) of this camera.HANDLING: The LX7 is a smallish, sleek little camera. The downside to this is that there isn't a lot of grip in my opinion, but many users looking at a camera in this class my be looking for clean and sleek over robust and grippy. It can make it easier to get in and out of a coat pocket, for example, and it's arguably more contemporary and sophisticated looking than some of the competition.OPTICS: The LX7's lens is somewhat wider than a lot of the competition (24mm, vs. say, 28mm) and is noticeably faster in the aperture department. The 24-90mm or so equiv. zoom range is admirable for general use, but those seeking a bit more zoom should obviously look elsewhere. There are other cameras that boast longer ranges in not extraordinarily larger packages. Keep in mind, however, that the longer the tele, the slower the aperture, esp. in bodies in this class. Images are generally pretty sharp, even in lower light, but I found the macro mode to be somewhat sluggish and even with manual focus tweaking activated, images often came out soft and even hazy. This wasn't in every case, but it was often enough over a short enough period of time to certainly stand out. On the plus side, the camera has an excellent aperture ring setup and the f/1.4 max aperture is a real bonus and the feature that Pana pushes the hardest to help separate itself from the pack. Aside from the mentioned frustrations, it's a good lens.METERING/COLOR: While the LX7's color and, most of the time, it's exposure are fairly good in natural light, especially outdoors, the camera does have a tendency to overexpose and in artificial light white balance can be heavily skewed. Colors are often rendered dull and inaccurate under these circumstance. Ironically, despite the tendency to over expose many general shots, esp. the highlights, the camera seemed to suffer from a bit of underexposure in interior settings. This was one of the major concerns I had when deciding whether or not to keep the camera. Keep in mind that if you're willing to help the camera out, you can fix many of these problems with manual adjustments to exposure, saturation, etc. However, for a camera with these capabilities (fast lens, current sensor/processor) and at this price point, I feel that the results can and should be more accurate out of the box.HIGH ISO: The LX7 is good at ISO performance esp. through 400. By 800 however, many other cameras in this class that I've both owned and tried begin to really stand out. Most general shooters likely wont have too much to quibble about here, but for the price, know that other models can give you cleaner images under more demanding circumstances despite the faster lens on the LX7. If you're current camera is an iPhone or a 3+ year old PAS, you will likely have no issue with image noise.LCD: This was another area that was super annoying. The screen isn't very high res.  in PRACTICE, despite the 920K rating. The menus look crisp and vivid, but actual live view in shooting seemed subpar for a camera of this quality. It looked pixelated in use. I couldn't figure this out. Maybe it was refresh rate. Too many other cameras in this class have a cleaner live view mode. It won't make or break an image, but it is frustrating when there's no other framing option like a built in EVF. (Keep in mind the optional EVF for this is VERY good in my opinion).QUICK LIST OF ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND GENERAL BULLET PRO/CON:Pros:- Fast lens - f/1.4-2.3 is outstanding for light capture- Excellent aperture ring - can adjust aperture by twisting the lens ring- Handy AF switch - quickly adjust from AF, Macro AF to MF with a 3-click slider- Great construction, solid feel - but a bit slick and not a lot of \"grip\"- Small for the feature set - e.g. there's a decent amount of tech in this smallish size- Hard coated LCD is easy to clean- Quick AF under most circumstances- Quick one-click ND filter- Excellent OIS (stabilization)- Decent macro (but can produce milky, soft details)- 2 custom modes- Accessory shoe for flash or EVF- Video in 60fps (though ridiculous MTS format), 30fps, 120 fps- Excellent OPTIONAL EVF w/ tilt 90 (a stretch to list as a pro since it's not included and more than $100 more)Cons:Menu resetting is MADDENING, if you accidentally back out of the menu system, you start at the top of the first setting, NOT where you left off- Aspect ratio switch is a waste of a good switch space IMO- Menus are not intuitive- Back jog wheel is too close to body, rotating not smooth- Lower resolution image detail on LCD in use (menu graphics are sharp however)- Somewhat disappointing performance over ISO 400, esp. in decent light- Traditional 3:2 slightly lower res than 4:3 ratio- Zoom tele a tad short for the class at 90mm, even with the aperture at that mark- Zoom is slow compared to some competition- Tad harder to grip due to slick materials and minimalistic design- MF magnified viewing is terrible, performance not much better- 120fps video only 720p with no manual controls (only EV comp)- Only 1 function button- No histogram in video mode- No Kelvin option WB- Inconsistencies in WB and color, esp. in artificial light- Camera has a tendency to overexpose, esp. in outdoor shots in daylight- Color is mostly good, but can be rendered muted at timesNOTE: Extensive AF performance in video mode not tested.CONCLUSION: When I set out to get a PAS in this class, I pretty much had my mind made up on the LX7. The look and potential of the LX7 is good, but too many problems and inconsistencies with usability and image quality were enough to justify returning it. For general everyday shooting it's a decent camera. However, I do feel that it should be smarter out of the box when it comes to exposure, white balance and color under artificial lighting. More experienced users my find other issues with output like edge softness, ISO performance, etc. These things in and of themselves aren't devastatingly bad, but more experienced users will likely pay closer attention to these things and find that they come up short of the mark when compared to other cameras in this class.I returned this camera in favor of a different one in the same class. Many users are EXTREMELY happy with this camera and you may very well end up being one of them - and I hope you are. But I encourage you to try out as many models in your budget as you can before making your final decision - this is just smart shopping - and take full advantage of Amazon's excellent return policy if ANY camera you decide upon doesn't suit you needs.RATING BY USER TYPE:\"An every day Joe looking for a good point and shoot that will be superior to your iPhone, is sleek and sophisticated and under many situations will produce admirable quality output\" I'd say this is a 3-4 camera (though I would advise shopping around)\"For the more experienced user who knows their way around camera settings and exposure, who's looking for an every day camera so the DSLR can stay at home and who is more likely by their nature to notice exposure, WB and color inconsistencies\" I'd say this is more of a 2-3  camera. (IMO there are other cameras in this price range that will better suit your needs)OVERALL: 3 stars. Despite the limitations and performance issues that I encountered, I think many general audiences will really like this camera. I certainly do believe there are better performers and values in this class, but the LX7 offers enough good features to warrant an average rating.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Video mode of LX7 has been crippled", "Author": "T. Marshall \"trevmar\"", "ReviewID": "R3UIAKU36D03Q5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There is a CMOS sensor in the LX7, and it is a nice sensor. ISO800 is useful rather than ISO400 on my LX5. RAW is clean, even at very high ISO (1600). In the presence of noise, the RAW clarity remains. More importantly, the CMOS sensor eliminates the vertical purple lines that appear around bright lights in the LX5 videos.IMO, the biggest feature of the LX7 is the addition of FullHD Video. But Panasonic has crippled the LX7 so it can film a maximum clip length of 30 minutes. No weddings, no lectures. The LX5 films AVCHD until the battery runs out (about 2hrs 16mins) but the improved FullHD video on the LX7 stops at the 30 minute mark. And at the 30min/4 mark if you shoot at the high speed mode 120fps (x4 framerate)(it only gives you 7 minutes). So forget any idea of leaving your camera focused on a tree, hoping to catch that magical bird takeoff. If the birds haven't flown in 7 minutes, your LX7 has stopped filming.Additionally, when I try to use Shutter-Preferred Creative-Video mode to get smooth motion-blur, I find that I am not allowed to use the bokeh from the new lens. When I engage the new internal ND filter in Shutter-Preferred mode, in order to maximize bokeh, I find the lens is restricted to f4. I cannot use the f1.4 - f3.5 stops. So I cannot get decent bokeh from the new lens unless I jump through hoops and use an external screw-on ND filter (there is an adapter to buy, too).I understand that Panasonic are terrified that these new cameras will hurt sales of their camcorder range, but there is no excuse for crippling the LX7 in this way. Panasonic are making you carry both a camcorder and the LX7 in your pocket when you travel. IMO If Panasonic want to sell these LX7 they had better put their thinking caps on, and issue a firmware upgrade ASAP...

Its an absolute pleasure to hold and the camera's physical controls are perfect.  Secondly, its outdoor and low light performance is excellent.  However, it fails miserably when it comes to taking portrait type photos under artificial lighting. I took the camera to Cancun a few weeks ago and all of the photos of my wife and kids in anything other than natural lighting during the day looked horrible. I tried repeatedly to take photos while eating in restaurants and other settings that used artificial lighting and all of the pictures were either washed out by the flash or had the wrong skin tones. I tried every setting on the camera, which included changing the flash intensity and white balance, and I could never get a good photo. At first I thought I did not know how to set up the camera, but when I used my wife's RX100 it took excellent photos on the superior auto setting. I personally can't stand how Sony has buried most of the RX100's controls in its software, but in the end I have to go with the camera that takes the best picture.  Since I take a lot of portrait type photos of my family, the LX7 was useless to me. I'm outside the return period so I will be selling mine and sticking with our RX100.

I am a basic point and shoot kind of photographer, but I love great photos mostly to document trips and family.What I like the most:  I love the fast shutter speed.  I rarely use the flash and hardly ever have fuzzy photos from moving targets.  It is light weight and easy to carry. There is a rechargeable Li battery and charger included.  I think that the camera is a great value.Things that could be better:1) I wish that there was an automatic lens cap.  Based on a review, I ordered the Goya auto lens cap for < $10 but couldn't figure where the lens ring was to remove to put on the auto lens cap.  Panasonic's service was significantly less than optimal. I spent > 1 hour on the Panasonic website trying to figure out where the lens ring was.  Then I spent more time with the on-line chat only to have him/her tell me that it didn't exist (it does).  I e mailed Goya and got a fairly prompt response with a link to a YouTube video ([...]) that showed how to remove the lens ring.  (I'm not quite sure why this information wasn't included with the auto lens cap.)  The lens cap then installed easily.  It is SO much easier to have this auto lens cap that to take the Panasonic lens cap off, leave it hanging on its string, and replacing it when I'm done.2) There is no view finder.  This hasn't been a problem so far, but on my last Canon camera, when I was in the rain forest in Costa Rica looking at white faced Capuchin monkeys, I could see them on the LED in the dappled light but they were visible with the view finder.3) There is no wi-fi connection that many other cameras now have.  However, plugging the camera into my Mac's USB port after downloading Silkypix onto the computer was very simple.I have a friend that has a <1 year old Panasonic point and shoot that cost her over $100 more than mine and she now has camera envy.

I have purchased and returned many, many cameras -- Fujifilm, Canon, Nikon, and other Lumix models, for various reasons but mostly because of the quality of the photos taken indoors.  The Leika lens, the sturdy metal feel of the Lumix DMC-L7W camera, and most of all the quality of the photos taken with it under any condition elevates it above the rest of the P&S; pack.The only thing that prevents my 5-star rating:  the removable lens cap is a pain.  I would have rather had a lens cover that opened and closed automatically like most P&S; cameras.  Also, FYI, the flash does not pop up automatically when using the \"Auto\" setting on this camera.  This is helpful most of the time because you can decide yourself if you need fill-in flash, something that isn't possible on \"Auto\" with a lot of P&S; cameras.  But by the way, this camera does take great photos without the flash most of the time (in museums and other places where you can't use a flash).I'm very happy with this camera!

I have a number of p & s cameras, this is because I can't afford the Canon wide-angle lens that I want (maybe if I stopped buying p & s cameras...). The LX7 has a 24mm wa length and I love it, plus you can zoom out if you want to. I am not that impressed with the macro function but I am still learning the features of the camera so I am probably doing something wrong. It does close focus very well. A problem that I have is that Photoshop CS5 doesn't support LX7 Raw format so I have to use Silkypix to shoot raw. That is a beef I and others have with Adobe, I understand their point but it's frustrating for consumers. Why should I have have to buy CS6? The HDR function is just ok, it would be nice is you could select whether you want 3, 5, or 7 exposures combined and the output is jpeg, raw would be better, it comes out better than a single exposure.

I am still getting used to the lack of a SLR viewer, but I will get there.I purchased a Vivitar DF-183-OP Speedlight, Panasonic version, for the camera so that I could do bounce illumination.  In my opinion, it does not integrate very well with the LX7.  Consequently, I hardly ever use it.  I hate to use a flash, but the built-in flash helps for some situations.  My D-70 had a feature that would expose for the flash, but keep the shutter open to bring up the background.  Very nice.  I have not discovered anything quite that good on the LX7.  The closest equivalent wants to flash twice, at beginning and end.Really, the nits are minimal.  I got mine for $299 during a holiday sale.

It needed to fulfill the following requirements:1. Size: compact enough to carry around in a handbag2. Ease of use: point and shoot3. High image qualityWe were able to try it out on a short trip. How did it do?1. Size: AcceptableI would not call it a compact -- it's somewhere between a compact and a micro 4/3. It's just small enough, but the lens on the front causes the case to be a bit bulkier.2. Ease of use: Failed. Reasons:- The iA mode (and iA+) is not intelligent enough. It would choose lower shutter speeds than needed, given this is a very fast lens. I created a Custom 1 settings that negates some of this (minimum shutter speed 1/60 and max ISO 1600). What you lose by using C1 mode is some of the smarts that are helpful, such as the detection of portrait or landscape photography and other enhancements, which is a pity.- The flash does not pop up automatically. Also something you do not want to think about.- Lens cap has to be removed manually. Will likely purchase one of these aftermarket lens caps.3. Image quality: AcceptableUnder the right conditions, and with all settings selected correctly, the images look very good. Forget iA mode indoors, as it will disappoint with low shutters speeds, especially with the flash not popped up. Also, somewhat unexpected, I noticed a good amount of lens flare in various images, taken indoor and outdoor. What you get is a mixed bag of images, regarding quality.OverallWe were on the verge of returning this camera, but the reality is, that at this price point (we paid $300) and size, there is hardly anything else that competes with this camera. Like said before, when you get everything right, it does make very nice pictures. Compared to the previous compact Panasonic my wife has, this is still somewhat of a setback regarding convenience. There is just too much thinking required for quick point and shoot type of situations:- Take lens cap off- Switch on camera- Are we indoors and there is decent/low light? Switch to C1.- Are we indoors and there is not enough light? Popup flash. May consider iA mode now.- Are we outdoors? Switch to iA mode.All of the above would be so much simpler if iA mode actually works.Panasonic folks - please provide a small update to the iA mode. Make it just a teeny bit smarter regarding balancing shutter speed and ISO (don't go lower than 1/60 or make that an option). A small change will make a huge difference and will push this camera in the top of its class. Right now it's a bit crippled (great hardware, but a broken iA mode).

As a side note, I will tell you that the T3 produces (in my opinion) photos equal to all it's big brothers including the T3i, T4i, and T5i, so if you're thinking about moving up to a DSLR and plan to shoot on auto most of the time, don't spend more than you have to. But that's another review, so let me get back to the subject at hand. What I was about to say is that although the results I get with a DSLR is hard to reproduce with a point and shoot camera, I'm constantly on the lookout for a small, super high quality, point and shoot camera that I can carry for those times when I don't want to lug the bigger camera bag or be ready 24/7 with a pocket camera so no great shots escape me. Up to now, my Panasonic ZS15 has done a decent job of that for me. Recently, I bought my son a Canon S110 which he took to Disney World and we viewed all his vacation pics this week on a 50 inch LED flat screen and the detail was fabulous.  Listing one time for about $600, I expected this reduced price $300 Panasonic LX7 camera to blow those away. Unfortunately, it did not. I was hoping the wonderful Leica F1.4 lens would allow me to grab great candids anywhere on automatic without the flash. Such was not the case. The stills I shot on auto of various subjects with the lighting set to incandescent were quite admirable. But once I took it to shoot the grandkids with auto white balance, the lighting and look of the pics was all over the place. More importantly, the autofocus couldn't keep up with the kids and only about 50% of the pics were acceptable for sharing, in my eyes. Now I must say, this camera has tons of adjustments and dials, far more than I need as I used it only on automatic. It was also inconsistent on when it called for the flash, which you must manually pop-up into position, then making it hard to grasp the camera on the left side. I should say at this time that in a rare mishap, Amazon, who I have successfully purchased many electronics from, sent me a used camera by mistake, so before reordering, they suggested I try it out, which I did. Perhaps the previous owner abused this camera, though I did return all the settings to their original position. Nonetheless, I was disappointed with the results. I'll be returning this one and not reordering another. I'll stick with my Panasonic ZS15 which gives me great shots most of the time when I can't take my DSLR.

It takes really nice video.  Better than my Sony movie camera which is ancient granted but for a compact sized camera the movie quality is really nice.  However......I have a brand new MacBook Pro.  A very nice computer.  Unfortunately my very nice camera and my very nice computer hate each other!!!!  They aren't speaking at all.  My computer pretends as if my camera doesn't exist.  It completely ignores the files of movies that I have taken.  I looked into it and apparently Mac doesn't recognize AVCHD and the Panasonic insists that this is the way to go.  I downloaded and paid for a AVCHD converter.  I had never heard of this before but figured I would need this to convert the files in my camera.  The program looks simple enough.  Drag and drop file to convert it.  That would be swell if the Mac actually recognized the file.  Now I am no computer psychologist but these two just really don't seem to want to get along.  No nasty messages about compatibility.  It's just a flat out refusal to recognize the others existence.  My Lumix did have a better relationship with my old Mac but that went kaput.  It wasn't an easy relationship but at least the would communicate with a translator.  It's very frustrating to have all these lovely movies on a camera that you can't use.

There are very few cameras on the market right now with that capability.Pros:  this is the best general-purpose video camera I have ever used. And I have used a lot of cameras. Also takes great pictures as long as there is plenty of light.Cons:  I wish the power zoom lens was faster. It takes too long to zoom in.

After owning the LX5 for a couple years, what I'm not happy with the most is the build/material quality over the LX5. The body feels more plastic, the lens cap is cheap and isn't metal anymore, the white finish is flat and looks cheaper (I have the camera in white). The neck strap is way cheaper. Maybe these are small things to pick at but overall it just looks and feels cheaper which I'm sure it is because that's how it goes in general with any product... those not owning previous models of this camera won't know the difference anyway but this camera has definitely been cheesed down.Aside from that, the new menu UI is much better. The lens seems to have less distortion and fringing at it's widest. The 1.4 is nice and creamy and bright. ISO 80 is a plus. The auto white balance handling seems a little better. RAW shooting will definitely get better results overall when images are processed. And I believe the CCD sensor in the LX5 is superior in quality to the CMOS in the LX7 especially with RAW shots. Granted this is no full fledged DSLR but with the right tweaks and editing you can get pretty close in quality. I've printed 30x40's off my LX5 before.Another bug suck factor seems to be the battery life. On my first test on a full battery I shot less than 100 shots (no flash) and used half the battery with minimal display playback. The camera sat for a few weeks with no use. I turn it on to take a picture and the battery is DEAD. How does the batter drain with no power on? The exact same thing happened to my husband who has the same camera in black.Lastly, the price... why does it fluctuate so much? This camera is NOT worth more than $400. It should sell for less than $350 tops. Thank god we got them on sale when we caught the price at $249.

So close, yet so far", "Author": "Josi Kim", "ReviewID": "R3SRE2EB85EI9U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I admire Panasonic and their pact with Leica, however, I can't say that they've blown me away with anything quite yet. I really like their lenses, but that's about it. As a disclaimer, I normally shoot with a Canon 6D DSLR, so this review may come off a bit harsh. I was also once the owner of the Panasonic DMC-LX5 after reading rave reviews, and after a month of shooting with it, ended up selling it due to some nagging aliasing and performance issues I couldn't get over. After seeing the LX7 on Amazon's lightning deals, I decided to pick up the latest iteration because it was quite affordable compared to when I purchased the LX5 for $500. But once again, it fell short of my expectations, and even at a low price-point, I just couldn't get myself to keep it.First, the good stuff.The lens is amazingly bright, fast, and sharp. During daylight situations, it's snappy and does the job well. You can get literally within inches of a subject and get a clean macro shot. The bokeh has a nice effect and overall, I'm still very impressed with the optics on the LX series.I'd say one of the neatest features is that you can change the aspect ration on the fly and it maintains the full megapixels. It's definitely useful in this day and age with people who love uploading to Insta.Now for the bad.It's unfair for me to compare this to my DSLR, but hey, a good compact in my opinion, can keep up with decent DSLRS, especially when it's boasting a superfast lens. I love to shoot photography without flash but I'm sorry to say that I've missed too many opportunities due not necessarily because of the lens, but because of the focusing. The focusing on the camera in low-light, even with the af assist beam, tends to drag out a bit and I missed many good moments because of it.After a while, you begin to cope with the a/f issues and even then, the pictures for whatever reason just don't come out as nice as I hoped under low-light conditions. The ISO gets very noisy after 3200 and eventually gave up and popped the flash.I think if the flash performance was decent, I would've kept it, but this was the deal breaker for me.The flash is almost pointless. I didn't get into researching on how the flash compensates for itself, but by default, it didn't do a great job. It would either come out over exposed or underexposed in most situations. Granted you can always change the flash power settings in the menu, but nobody got time for that...Not to mention it has issues with Red-eye, even though it claims to prevent red-eye. It's just not cool...At the end of the day, I felt like the overall picture quality was the same from what I remember with the LX5. I was really hoping they'd push the envelope with high-end point and shoots, but I ended up returning the LX7 before our return period. Other than the price, I was absolutely disappointed. The potential is there, but the sensor just felt like the same stuff they had in the LX5.In any case, if you don't care for low-light photography and are looking for a good or even great point and shoot at a low price point, this might be your best bet. It can shoot raw and the lens is bar none one of the best among point and shoots. Too bad the sensor and software can't say the same. Leica does an amazing job with the optics, but Panasonic needs to step up their game.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Issue with Panoramic Shoots and lens cap", "Author": "CJ Chretien", "ReviewID": "RDJ8RMZIL173N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I generally like the quality of the photos, however I have two issues with this camera.Firstly, I took this camera on a European trip and was very disappointed with the panoramic shots.

Not me:  I previously used a Zeiss Contaflex, Leica p/s and a Nikon, but all of them use film.  I can't lug rolls and rolls of film in my carry on when I go to Europe, thus I bought this one on the basis of the Leica lens.  So now I'm into the manual and its atrocious.  The photos I've taken just using iA are beautiful, but I'd like to use more of the features and am stymied by this horrible manual.  Having spent numerous hours pursuing clarification of terms and buttons I didn't have on my other cameras I just came across a most promising Kindle book dealing with the LX7.  While grateful to have thought of looking on Amazon, finding this book also infuriated me even more.  All Panasonic had to do was write a lead-in paragraph or two to introduce each topic or even construct a flow-diagram (a what???), but no, all they did was to produce this jumbled, disorganized, unorganized, disjointed mess covering 250+ pages.My advice to anyone buying this camera is to buy the Kindle book at the same time.  Never mind about the viewfinder, the camera bag, the tripod, the extra flash, blah blah.  If you can't make head nor tail of the manual, you'll be confined to iA -- and that is an injustice to the camera.A week or so later:  I have Alexander S. White's \"Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX7\" on my Kindle and then saw that it also comes in book form so I ordered that, too.  I decided that trying to read the Photographer's Guide on my Kindle was going to mean charging the Kindle every night, and that meant not having the Kindle available for my evening read.  In addition:  it means I will have the Photographer's Guide with me when I travel.  Sometimes I am just in a state of wonderment at how lucky we are to have all of this technology available.Later still:  I have already ordered a wrist strap and a self-operating lens cap.  I had too many straps, etc. interfering and getting in the way when I was trying to take a picture.  The neck strap really got in the way and took up too much room in the camera bag and got all tangled up - and then I had hooked the lens cap to the neck strap so a nuisance all way around.  I've already attached the lens cap:  stuck my hand in a rubber glove and unscrewed the retainer ring.  No problem at all, but still have to see if some of the reviewers' comments about the lens cap mean it's going to be a problem.  Another note:  I also bought a viewfinder and have yet to figure out where to put the hotshoe so that I don't lose it.Given all of the additions I've ordered the cost of the camera has gone up.  A prospective buyer might want to think about that when making comparisons to other cameras.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Broke after only 2 weeks", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R12XRLNPH4Q148", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "While I was on vacation, refused to power back on.

I absolutely love my trusty G12, but my 53 year old eyes really could use a viewfinder better than the optical one on the Canon. So I thought the Lx7 with the optional LVF2 viewfinder would be just the ticket.When the camera arrived, I was very pleased with the overall package. The LVF2 provided exactly what I wanted in terms of a viewfinder, it is bright and sharp and with the diopter adjustment i could see my subjects with laser precision The f1.4 lens with 24mm wide angle seemed like great improvements over my G12's f2.8 28mm wide angle. I knew I was giving up 50mm in telephoto length, but figured the trade off would be worth it for the faster wider Lx7 lens.Then I started shooting and I was happy with ergonomics and camera feel. I shot comparison shots of everything with my canon as well. After shooting I was convinced that I had made a good upgrade choice. Then I started looking critically at my results. What I saw, was that the LX 7 produced very nice images. And if I had nothing else to compare them too, I would probably have been happy with my purchase. But when I compared the images critically with those from the G12, there was not a single image where the G12 did not look better and in some cases much better. It was better in terms of noise, better in terms of color balance, better in terms of sharpness and more often than not better in terms of the exposure choices it made. Now, I know much of this was due to jpeg processing. I think I just like the processing the Canon provides better than Panasonic's. And yes, I could shoot raw and post process, for the best image quality but that is not my thing.The LX7 has a bit of a noise problem that starts at ISO 400 and the G12 is good to 1600. I thought the 2 stop faster lens would make up for this, but that was not the case in the critically examined images.Overall this is a good camera. I would say it is a very good camera in most respects, but it is not at the top of class, or even close, for jpeg image quality. So I will be returning it along with the truly incredible LVF2. I really wish I could slap an LVF2 on my G12, and I would be in heaven. A minor issue was the fact that the Lx7 with the LVF2 viewfinder on top doesn't fit into any of the commercially available small camera cases designed for a belt loop and that makes carrying it a bit more difficult and the lense cap is inconvenient, but I know there is an aftermarket cap that can solve that issue.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "very nice compact camera.", "Author": "arden", "ReviewID": "R2SR80RM6JEBD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought lx7(1080P) to upgrade my lx5(which only has 720P video).

In sending in my camera that was 5 months old, I was required to open a repair order online which never gave any updates,  even if the camera was received.  I believe a company is as good as their repair center and customer service and both failed in this case. Just an FYI for the future, again I am NOT rating the camera.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's not all about the technical", "Author": "Harry M.

Although the tech specs on this camera looks good and although the camera is capable of producing great shots, photography is not all about the technical  (at least from my point of view).  The biggest problem with this camera is that the ergonomics is flawed and the menu system is dumbed down.  I won't go through the litany of examples, but one very basic one is that you can't add / modify to the quick panel (I'm not sure what the official term is) menu;  you're stuck with whatever Panasonic thought you would need.  My thinking is, if you're going to have a professional type compact camera, then why dumb it down?  And then as already noted above, the ergonomics;  it's just terrible.  Trying to shoot, make adjustments on the fly is a lesson in patience;  the camera gets in the way of shooting.  On the otherhand, something like the Ricoh GXR is the exact opposite;  excellent ergonomics, excellent menu system, various buttons on the camera;  it never gets in the way of photography (The reason I don't use this now is because it's too slow; yes, I know, that is a tech spec).  Another example of someone getting it right is the Olympus XZ-2 (which I currently use);  similar tech specs, but much better ergonomics, hugely superior menu system with customization;  it doesn't get in your way when you're shooting.  In many ways, this review (JUL 2013) is irrelevant because I'm sure that Panasonic is going to come out with an updated camera, but I thought I'd put in my 2 cents worth.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "bek", "ReviewID": "R24R0KB693I656", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent feel.great pictures.

The LX2 went with me everywhere and I shot many thousands of images with it. So I figured it was time for an upgrade. I did read the spec's and figured the limited zoom range (no improvement over the LX2) was OK so I'd compromise.When I got the LX7 I immediately realized that Panasonic had made the camera BIGGER. Not by much, but BIGGER. Does the lens need the body of the camera to be bigger?The user interface has changed: There is a \"funny red button\" on the top of the camera that is for video -- right next to the shutter release button. I will still have to set the knurled dial to video mode to shoot so why does the camera need a second button? Simplify, simplify, simplify. And yet _another_ button on he back to display the images. The dial selection of the LX2 is clearly superior: select the mode you want; turn the camera on; press the shutter button to take a picture or start the video. Less is more.The LX7 has improved in one minor way: the finger grip no longer has a shiny metal part that was pure styling in the LX2 without any function. However, they just couldn't resist writing LUMIX in the middle of the lens cap and putting a circular decoration on the thing. This is a CAMERA, it's a tool -- leave all the names and logos to the silly FCC label underneath -- displaying the brand name is for Gucci bags.The LX2 would shoot 10M pixels in 16:9 mode. Now I only get 9.5M. I'm NOT going to shoot in the old-fashioned 4:3 mode to get 10M pixels. Screens are now 16:9 or 16:10 -- it was silly having 'variable' aspect ratio in the first place, on the LX2 -- anyone can always crop images after they are out of the camera.I could be wrong but I detect much more barrel distortion in the LX7 than I experienced with the LX2, maybe it is optimized for 4:3 ?I think I need to see what Nikon & Canon has to offer.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Symplicity", "Author": "Bob Michaels", "ReviewID": "R3K9NJIHHNF1Z6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Needed something for my wife to use without too many buttons and knobs.

Srivastava", "ReviewID": "RGWDTH3D6FXH9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Waited months for this camera but unfortunately will be returning after a few days of use. Prime reason: poor usability.It is heavier than most P&S; cameras i have used (including the canon g12). This makes it very difficult to use it single handed. The largish grip does not provide a confident hold regardless of what you see in images or other reviews. It kept on tilting forward due to large and heavy lens element. I do not use a neck strap so maybe for those of you who do, it will be more balanced.Second big reason for the return is the blasted lens cap. I read reviews of the Lx3 and LX5 where people were complaining about the lens cap and i thought they were being over-critical. I mean what's a little hassle if you get good image quality in the end right? I use a DSLR too so I thought it would be fine. But i was wrong. The lens cap is much smaller than typical DSLR caps- so it is more prone to getting lost. It also slows down the whole act of taking a picture- before the click and after.I have a toddler so speed is important for me. Panasonic provides a lanyard to keep the cap locked to the body and i thought that should do it but guess what, the cap does not come off automatically when you turn the camera on. You need to manually remove it and then begin shooting. Since the lens zooms when the camera is turned on I thought the lens cap will fall off due to this action and since i had the lanyard connected, it would remain tethered. Not so. Enough said about the lens cap.Third reason: You can't preview captured images without turning on the camera, at least I couldn't. I tried holding the playback button for a few seconds hoping it would turn on the LCD but no luck. So back to the power button. But when you do that, the camera wants you to first remove the lens cap so that it can do its thing of zooming the lens and getting the camera to a ready state- which is not what i wanted. I just wanted to preview previously captured images. So again i have to deal with the lens cap. C'mon Panny, what the heck.Fourth reason: The image quality was not as good as i expected despite the Leica lens. The colors were not as true as my other cams can produce.Most pictures looked over saturated. Maybe there are settings that can improve this but i expected it to work out of the box.Finally, and this is a small one, the power button is also weird. It's not the usual push in to power on. You need to slide inside. A slide-out to power on seems more intuitive to me if you can't have a push type button or a decent size knob like on the panasonic GX1.So what it boils down to is a bad user experience for even the most basic aspects. Old Panasonic users may find this review pretty harsh or even useless but as a first time Panasonic user who expects the best image quality from a 2012 model P&S; camera that should be easy to use, I found the entire package less than usable.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lx5 is Still King", "Author": "Dagby Diggers", "ReviewID": "R2HIF70Z6DN5DH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is great its got alot of new things besides being able to shoot low light, and better video.....Its sensor is CMOS where as the LX5 is a CCD.
