We were going to Mexico, and I thought the underwater feature would be fun for them.Within one week, both of the cameras leaked and are completely broken. At no point were they in deeper than 2 feet of water, even though they are supposedly waterproof to 10 feet. We took great care to make sure the battery compartment was closed completely and correctly each time, but it still leaked. The first camera completely broke immediately. The second one first lost the lcd screen, but within a day was completely inoperable. They were never dropped or mishandled.If I could give no stars, I would.Even when working, the pictures are not great and inconsistent. They are constantly blurry and we would have to take several of the same shot to try and to get one decent one.I have tried to get the company to do something with the warranty, but they have not responded to phone calls.Cameta Camera (the seller) did not offer a longer return period for Christmas gifts, so now I am stuck with them - and my kids have nothing.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.95", "Features": "Digital zoom: 5x, Display: 2.7-inch LCD\nMovie mode: 720 x 480 at 30 frames per second, 12 scene modes, Voice and memo recording\nSD/SDHC card compatibility up to 16GB, Programmed auto exposure, Slideshow playback\nBuilt-in flash, PictBridge enabled\nIncludes: Image editing software, 2GB SD card and USB card reader", "Name": "Bell and Howell WP5-S Splash 12MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 2 GB Memory Card (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bZfRDvQxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0040HNXUS"}}
