A great price for a really decent camera, great for taking pics of the kids with the stabilization feature.We compared this to two others quite extensively while shopping, and in this price range it had the best combination of features.  The software that comes with it is quite nice too.  I have photoshop, but the software is elaborate enough to file and store your photos and do just about all of the editing that you would need to do for home use.The menus also feature very user-friendly messages and notes, making this a great camera for my parents, who purchased this as their first digital camera.  The menus are easy to understand and to navigate.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Summer", "ReviewID": "R1J9XOHUA4ECRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera! We looked at alot of cameras and this one was the best in the price range. We have a very active 2 year old and it takes wonderful pictures of him. My husband took a picture of our ceiling fan while it was moving and the picture came out clear, you couldnt tell that the fan was moving. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent priced camera.", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Really nice", "Author": "Ellie B", "ReviewID": "R2QBRHQ2UZRDB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My sister bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas.  We are really impressed with it's quality.  I own a Canon A560 and I think the pictures taken with this camera are even nicer.  It's very user friendly and you can do some nice editing on the camera itself.  I am very impressed.

She ended up dropping the camera and breaking it, and then she got a different camera, so I really wanted to continue to use the dock to print my pictures, so I had to find the camera to go with the dock, and here it was on Amazon, and the price was fantastic!

Unfortunately, I dropped it one day and cracked the door that protects the memory card and holds the batteries.  I actually put masking tape across it which was a pain to deal with but it still worked.  I have two digital Canon SLR cameras but I really like having a smaller camera to carry in my purse.  Last Christmas I bought a smaller Canon camera and was not happy with it so I exchanged it for a smaller Nikon camera and I'm still not happy with it either.  Today I decided to see if I could find another HP Photosmart M547 and I was shocked that I could still buy a new one!!  I have had such good luck with this little camera, that I immediately purchased another one.  I saw that they now have a M637 but I figured that I would stick with what I know and maybe eventually upgrade to that one.  If you don't have a good little camera, this is the one to buy!!  I take pictures all the time and I love this little camera!!!!!", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good up grade from our older HP camera", "Author": "GROG \"GROG\"", "ReviewID": "R2OGFC4RNQVXYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera was purchased as a refurb and it  works very well and is easy to use.

Everything advertises it as the 8MP including the receipt.  Truth of the matter is that it is mis-advertised on the website.  When we called to let them know and try to get the 8 PM we were told it was a mistake on the website and we could ship it back but would NOT be guaranteed a 8PM camera (basically they would have sent us the same camera).
