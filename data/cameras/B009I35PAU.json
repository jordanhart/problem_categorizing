Amazing zoom power, you can get such a clean image from a distance. The red eye correction actually corrects red eye! Even when cropping an image, you still turn out a crisp picture when cropping in really close. You cannot find a better camera for the price of this one!", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT GIFT FOR HUBBIE!!!", "Author": "Kay R.

It takes very good pictures.  I bought it because of all the accessories it came with.However, the Fuji 4500 S is a better buy. It costs the same without the accessories but takes much bettervideos. Foolish me.  Don't repeat my mistake. Either get the Fuji or pay a bit more and buy a Canon SX500or Canon SX280.  There's your answer.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Dolores Ford", "ReviewID": "R1REFD8FKN3U34", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We received the camera in plenty of time to try it out and get used to it before we went on vacation.We are pleased with the pictures and ability of zoom.

Lots of adjustable options in a sub-$200 point and shoot, along with a very good auto picture option.  The bundle however was not what I expected.  I received all items as listed in the product page, but the camera case is way too small for the SX160.  I will have to provide my own.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "What I expected", "Author": "K.

The only way that it could ever fit over the camera is for a stretching machine to do the job for you. I tried for several minutes and it was useless.  One should be able to slide a camera into its case. If it takes several minutes then get another case.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera is great, accessories not so great", "Author": "Fernando Soubeste", "ReviewID": "R1QYNCGL2UJHAC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am very satisfied with the camera, but the accessories sent did not meet the expectations, por example the bag is not big enough to put the camera in it and totally different than the one in the picture.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Great value", "Author": "D.
