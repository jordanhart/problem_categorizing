{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Limiting Bracket", "Author": "S.J. \"S.J.\"", "ReviewID": "RQDJF69GOKJB6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera appears to be fairly well made and works well while testing on my desk.  The picture quality is good and  I like the zoom & focus being allen screw adjustments as this allows me to set them and not worry about them being bumped out of focus.The bracket, however, is a huge limitation for me.  The camera has to be mounted from the side, exactly as shown in the picture.  It can angle upward about 20 degrees, downward about 60 degrees, and angled left or right, but that's all.  The bracket can't be mounted from the top, such as under an eave, or the bottom. Even when side mounted, the bracket has to attach at the bottom of the camera, not the top.  This is a limitation that should be stated in the product description.I might otherwise give it 4 or 5 stars if it weren't for the bracket being so limiting that I can't use this where I had expected to.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good General Use Camera", "Author": "S. Haywood", "ReviewID": "RAI8DSOIO054O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this security camera as a upgrade to an existing Lorex home security camera.  This camera is definitely an improvement.  The clarity of the night shot is great and the overall resolution is adequate for home use.  The on-screen menu system is a good selling point, but in reality it's not much use to me.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "Planker", "ReviewID": "R2DLCFBVWEA4UB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Easy install with great picture.

Now I know.  Security cameras, at least in this price range, are very low quality.  I bought two of these and both had the same exact issues.1. They would not focus at distances greater than about 15 feet.  This is a design flaw.  In broad daylight I could not identify my own son from 30 feet away with this camera.  In my opinion, any image processing device that will not focus is defective.2. They both had ghosting around every image in bright light.3. On moving objects, the color information is always a few pixels behind the actual object and it doesn't catch up until the object stops.4. Motion sensing is done by software, which looks for changes across the image. When pollen passes close by the camera at night, it reflects the IR light back into the lens and caused false motion alarms.  During pollen season, the alarm was going off non-stop.None of these issues could be adjusted away, and for the record, I put myself through engineering school working as an electronics technician for a TV station.  I've repaired and done set-ups on every conceivable type of camera.I should also point out that both of the cameras I received had a \"QC Passed\" sticker.The only information these cameras can provide is to know that a human was in the area.  Identifying the person would not be possible.  I have a $75 game camera that captures video when it detects motion.  That camera runs circles around these things!  Crisp, clean, color-true video.  I'll purchase more of those.  I returned these to Amazon.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera, But High Defect Rate", "Author": "Thomas S.

The other 6 have worked well and I am happy with them.The wide angle and quality of the picture has been very much appreciated.But, the 25% defect rate is unacceptable in my opinion!", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "BIG DOG", "ReviewID": "R14MYNF6P7IL5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product. easy to use and have not had a problem with them yet.
