The picture quality is amazing for a point and shoot, and the flash works really nice. There are a ton of modes and it even has it's own make up feature when it takes a portrait picture. It's very sleek and slim for a camera as well, so it can fit anywhere you want to put it!The video recording is pretty good, but it only records sound for about a minute and thirty seconds, which can be annoying. The lens also get's stuck from time to time, but that is just because I put my camera in my pocket instead of a case.So if you want a nice point and shoot camera for a reasonable price, get this one!", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "mreenrose", "ReviewID": "R3N3GKD729LK2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera because it's totally easy to use, takes great photos in any light, and everything is automatic.  This is a great first camera or a camera for someone like me who doesn't like to fool around with a lot of different settings and features that I will never use.  It's small and goes anywhere--I love it!", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another great casio point and shoot camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1E4KY5IGVE1D8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd casio Exlim camera. All of them are great and I have passed them along to my family members as I upgraded to the new models. I did not experience the microphone failure while shooting videos as it worked the entire length of the video (over 6 minutes). The image quality of the video image is reduced as you zoom in. Nice light weight camera. I plan to take backpacking with me.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price...", "Author": "Kiran Yerneni", "ReviewID": "RTKEDUT2GWBTJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is real slim and easy to carry. Upload of photos was easy and the s/w was auto installed once i plugged in the USB. There was no need for CD to upload your photos. One other thing i liked was the megapixel that you can choose from...it has 14MP but you can choose from 6, 3 etc depending on the photo print size that you want to take.Over all good camera for the price.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not good", "Author": "anyuta", "ReviewID": "R3QN3I33GQQU2Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Unfortunately, it's not working for me. Camera takes decent pictures sometimes, but a lot of times, they're out of focus and it takes forever to take the next picture. I have a 6 month old, so it's crucial to be able to take pictures quick and this camera is not doing the job well :(", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "New slim-line body design in exciting & fun colors with simplified rear button interface\nImage Stabilization\nPremium Auto Mode\nHD MovieSpecifications\nImage Sensor - 1/2.3-inch square pixel CCD / Total Pixels - 14.48 megapixels (/million)", "Name": "Casio EX-S200SR 14.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7 inch TFT LCD (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41C-lDnKa-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003XJ96XM"}}
