{"Reviews": [{"Title": "fantastic lens and sensor", "Author": "Streetphotopix", "ReviewID": "R1CS607L0NW6PU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.  I've used many systems trying to find the perfect street photographer / versatile carry around camera, and this is it.  As background, I've used Nikon D90, Canon 5D, Sony A850, Olympus 43, Panasonic GF-1, and this is my favorite camera yet.  I am an advanced amateur photographer who has exhibited at local galleries.Why you should buy the the GXR -- 100% customizable interface.  there is absolutely no need to dive into the menus.- everything is at the \"top level\" meaning there is instant control - just spin the knob or push the button.  There's no \"hold this button down then turn this\"  For example:  I shoot in aperture priority.  here are the commands that are directly accessible without any need to hold down any button or dive into menus:1) Aperture2) ISO3) exposure compensation4) switch to Manual focus5) enlarge image (focusing aid)6) focus assist (peaking)There are 5 additional, easily accessible and completely customizable functions that are just 1 button press away.- snap focus mode with depth of field gauge.  This is amazing, highly useful for street photography, and taking photos of fast-moving kids.  there are 2 ways to do this:1) when the camera is in AF mode, you can make it so that if the shutter button is fully pressed in 1 motion, the camera will focus at a pre-determined and user-adjustable distance (i.e. 2-meters).  You can change this distance with 1 button press.  if you use 1/2 press shutter, it is AF as usual.2) when you are in snap focus or manual focus mode, there is a depth of field gauge that tells you the focus point and the DOF around that focus point.- great LCD screen at 920k dots- magnesium alloy build.  the build quality is superb.- you can hold the camera in 1 hand and operate almost all the controls.  Also, the back of the camera has a large area where the thumb can rest and not accidentally touch any other button.- the mode dial locks.  This prevents accidentally changing the shooting mode.Why you should get this lens module -- Very sharp lens- very versatile - 50mm standard lens, and also a macro lens- the focus is good.  The older firmware was not as good.  The latest firmware is much better, and focus is much improved.- the sensor is outstanding.  clean to ISO 800, and ISO 1600 needs just a touch of NR in lightroom 3.  the colors are fantastic and the image has a great look to it.- one issue that DP review points out is that the raw file output is a bit soft - that's just how the processing is.  It sharpens up perfectly with a bit of sharpening in LR3 - this reminds me of the files from the canon 5D.  The jpg files are sharp and contrasty.Now, here's a thought.  I never understood why people bought the GXR until now:1) the GXR balances sensor size to deliver a great shooting experience in a small form factor.  want a large zoom?  ok, get the 28-300 module.  It's got a small sensor to keep the overall size small.  If you want a 28-300 lens on full frame, buy the Canon 5D2 and 28-300 L for about $6000.  You want uncompromising image quality?  ok, get the 50mm or 28mm module w/ APSC module.  The A12 APSC sensor is superb.  clean to ISO 800.  1600 needs just a touch of NR in Lightroom.2) why would the majority of people really need more than ISO 1600 and 12MP? this sensor and lens setup on the A12 modules is so good, I don't think anyone would need to update.  i'll take the superior user interface any day.Who should NOT get the GXR?1) Sports photographers who need long, fast zoom lenses to shoot from the sidelines2) night wedding photographers needing ISO 3200 and a 70-200 2.8 zoom3) gear heads wanting to buy 12 lenses at 1,000 each, then wind up using just 2 of those.4) people who need long tele lenses (i.e. bird photographers or animal photographers) or ultrawide lenses.if you are in one of these groups, the GXR would not be a good 1 system camera, but would be a great 2nd system camera.Now that the M mount is coming out, it's just getting better.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect Sensor & Lens combo", "Author": "DrTebi", "ReviewID": "R3GQV17NJTI368", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Ricoh A12 50mm Macro \"lensor\" with the Ricoh GXR body create a compact camera with outstanding image quality. Images are rich in color, right on target with white-balance and provide excellent tonality and sharpness.I was quite surprised at the good quality of the JPG images, something that I found quite often disappointing in other cameras. If I want to tweak the ultimate out of an image however, I open and edit the DNG raw file with Photoshop's Camera Raw. I have compared images of the same subjects from this unit with other micro 4/3 cameras with 16 MP sensors, and while the 16 MP could provide a bit more detail in resolution, the A12's images always appeared crisper and richer.The built quality of the unit is superb, a solid metal construction. It has a good weight and feels good in use. It also includes a very convenient built-in lens hood.Ricoh has provided several firmware upgrades that added features and also improved the auto-focus speed, which was at first an often criticized issue. With the latest firmware update (1.50 at the time of this writing) the auto focus speed is more than adequate. In macro mode it may still \"hunt\" a bit at times; in those situations I often prefer the manual focusing options instead. Through the various focusing aids that the GXR provides, it is easy to get correctly focused images through manual focusing.The white balance handling also works out very well, another thing that my previous cameras struggled with.This camera/sensor unit together with the GXR body may not be everyone's cup of tea though--it's a prime lens, so if you like or need zoom capabilities, the A12 50mm unit is not for you. The video mode is limited to 720p, which is quite good, but not full HD; the video mode is unfortunately also fully automatic and aperture and focus cannot be changed during filming. For my purposes however, this is a 99% perfect camera. Together with the macro capabilities, this lensor has worked out very well outside as well as inside shooting jewelry in a studio setup.I think the Ricoh GXR is a very underestimated camera and really needs to be seen (or better yet, used) to truly get an impression of what a quality compact camera can be like.This is the first of about six digital cameras that I have used in the past that is actually a joy to use. The user interface of the GXR is very intuitive and within only a short period of time I felt very comfortable using this little gem.If you should decide to buy this unit, do yourself a favor and also buy a UV or Skylight filter to protect the lens. As a matter of fact, no lens should be without one. I prefer B&W; filters, the ones fitting this unit are B+W 40.5mm Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Coating (010M) or B+W 40.5mm Clear UV Haze with Single Coating (010).", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good quality, but pricey and impossible to clean", "Author": "Hengyi Hu", "ReviewID": "R3VE764DRF4UUG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned many macro lenses on DSLRs, and was excited to get this interchangeable lens/sensor combo for my GXR. I liked the novelty of the GXR, and purchased that with the 24-72mm lens/sensor option.The build on this unit is excellent. Ricoh did a great job of making this a closed system so no dust can get on the sensor. This is a mixed blessing because you also have no way of cleaning the sensor and the back of the lens like you would with a normal DSLR/macro lens combo. This is true of all lenses/sensors in this system. I've shot with this lens for about 2 weeks (fairly heavy use outside) and noticed small spots on my images due to dust on the sensor. I ended up returning this unit since it was within 30 days.Another problem is the cost - it will run you over $1000 for the Ricoh GXR and this lens, which means you have a lot of options if you wanted to spend that money investing in a DSLR and macro lens combo. Additionally, as an photographer I am sometimes torn over whether or not to swap lenses and sensors. Since this lens is CMOS, the pictures are obviously a lot better than the ones taken with the smaller sensored 24-72mm lens. This isn't a choice I'm used to making, since DSLRs you just have to decide to carry an extra lens.Overall, this unit is nicely built, but impossible to clean the lens or the sensor. I hope we would at least give us the self-cleaning sensors that vibrate from time to time to remove dust, but right now I can't recommend getting this if you already have a DSLR. For $700, you'd be much better off getting a macro lens separately.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent macro, unique design, crisp and clear photos", "Author": "S. Melvin", "ReviewID": "R26NCRZL78WRCD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ricoh has made a name for itself for high quality cameras with good optics.  This Ricoh model takes a revolutionary look at how point-and-shoot cameras can keep some of the major benefits of a DSLR, while still remaining compact and light enough to lug around.  By purchasing a universal base, which provides only the power and interface, this Ricoh design ensures that the camera you own today and become familiar with, will be the same one that you own tomorrow - just snap on a new lens body and you are ready to go.This particular lens is the standard and ubiquitous 50mm lens found on most starter (D)SLR cameras around the world.  If you truly want to learn how to take good photography, a 50mm lens is the way to go.  No uber-zooms, no wide angle issues - just straight photography as it was meant to be taken.  Add to that a great macro feature and you can really take some amazing photos.  The MP (12.3) on this lens isn't exactly first class any longer - but still very respectable for the average photography.  Unless you plan on blowing the picture up to wall-size, you should be fine.  And while this lens is fairly expensive (comparable to most DSLR lens that fit on Nikon, Canon, etc), it contains not only the lens, but also the CMOS chip that captures the photo - something that DSLR lens lack (as the camera body holds that chip on most DSLR cameras).Pros: near DSLR like quality photos; respectable megapixels; excellent macro; fully enclosed body to prevent damage/dustCons: cost; sliding on/off camera body sometimes a pain; if/when something finally finds a way inside the lens, no way to remove itOverall, this is a fine lens for the money and a great way to take photography - 50mm is the most versitile lens out there, in my humble opinion.  Ricoh gives the average photography an excellent means of having near DSLR like capabilities in what amounts to the size and weight of an advanced point-and-shoot camera.  Whether you are on the go or simply don't want to lug around a suitcase full of camera accessories, the Ricoh camera has you covered.NOTE: when updating this particular camera's firmware, remember that each lens you own must be individually updated, since each lens contains its own processor.  Many people update the camera body (as you would on most DSLR cameras), but forget that each lens likely has an update as well.  This could alleviate some issues you may experience with your lens.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Top notch lens", "Author": "macsareback", "ReviewID": "R36T52CXDHWVUL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well built, but pricey.
