My requirements were that I was looking for a camera to access remotely to check my home from time to time and to e-mail snapshots based on motion detection.First, let me list the pros:1.  Initial setup is pretty good.  Sets up quickly and is functioning in about 10 minutes.2.  Picture quality is impressive.3.  Camera has a multitude of setup options that allow for some serious fine tuning.4.  Accessing the camera remotely is easy - even with dynamic ip addresses.Now the one and only con:1.  Motion detect e-mail capability is non-existent, unless you're running your own SMTP server.While the setup went well, I spent roughly a week configuring the camera excatly the way I wanted it to work.  Trying different configurations and settings to see what the best combination was.  Much of this time was spent trying to configure the motion detect e-mail alerting system to work.  After going back and forth with tech support they verified that virtually all e-mail providers require secure authentication which the IP410W is not capable of.  So after setting up my own local SMTP server, it's now working - just not the way I had envisioned it when I purchase the camera.  Thus I had to drop one star and give it only 4 of 5 stars.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Compatibility Warning", "Author": "G.

In investigating this, it turns out that the newer cameras use a new \"chip\", and require different software to monitor the cameras on your PC.I have two Trendnet cameras, the IP-100W (fixed), and IP-400W (moveable) set up at my house. I wanted to add a third camera, and thought that the IP-410W (newer design) would be a good option.I verified with tech support at the company, that the new software (SecureView) works only on the new cameras, and the old software (IPview) only works on the old cameras.They do sell other software that can work for both, but that will cost $300-$400.Thought others should know.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good WIRED MJPEG pan/tilt IP camera", "Author": "Tom Servo", "ReviewID": "R2WVH0JVZVI52", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This cam is a sort of stripped down model of the Trendnet IP422W.The IP410 supports only a wired 10/100Mbit Ethernet connection (No WiFi) and doesn't feature audio recording or MPEG4 compression. Additionally there are no IR LEDs so there is no night vision mode as in the IP422 (Both are indoor cams). However it's cheaper and if you're running a wired camera network (which is more reliable than WiFi) this is a better option that the IP422, assuming you don't need the additional features (although I think they should have left in the MPEG4 feature since it's standard in most new IP cams). The capture resolution can be as high as 640x480 up to 30FPS (just like the IP422). See my review of the Trendnet IP422 for additional details.JAN2012 UPDATE: The IP410/422 is now an older model, see my review of the TRENDnet TV-IP602WN ProView Wireless Pan/Tilt/Zoom Internet Surveillance CameraFEB2012 UPDATE: If you have a TV-IP410 hardware revision 1.x your camera may have a critical firmware bug allowing live images to be viewed BYPASSING AUTHENTICATION. If you have a TV-IP410 with firmware lower than V1.1.1 build 50 your camera is INSECURE!

The image clarity is not as sharp as I had hoped for.Two major issues.  First, after a couple of weeks issues developed with the camera dropping the wireless signal.  After dropping the signal the camera needs to be rebooted.  No problem if you are at home with the camera but if you are away and viewing remotely and the camera needs to be rebooted you're out of luck until you return home. After researching the problem I found that this is a common issue experienced by other users.Secondly, after six weeks, the camera would not capture any image at all.....there was only a pure white screen.  Tried rebooting, clean install, clean hardwired install on another computer, replaced cables, etc.  Finally, submitted a help ticket to Trendnet.....waited a week, no answer.  Submitted another ticket. After another week, still no answer.  I'm afraid to send the camera back to Trendnet due to their lack of response so I'm getting ready to pack it up and send it back to Amazon. They can deal with Trendnet.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Delivers as promised", "Author": "R.

Pulley", "ReviewID": "R3D53QBS451HNN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the wired version of this camera which also has a wireless version. After reading all of the reviews for both, including the night time IR version here is what I took away from it:1.  Many people describe the wireless version are being very difficult to set-up.  Read all of the reviews for the 410W and 422W before trying this on your own.2.  There were multiple reports of the wireless versions cutting out on their own requiring an unplugging reboot.  From descriptions, it sounds as if this is an overheating issue.3.  The Night time IR feature does not work behind glass, which includes the optional outside mount all weather dome.  So, don't think you can use it to look out a window at night because the IR reflects back and washes out the image.4.  Trendnet sells 2 different platforms (Proview and Secure View) of cameras that are not interchangeable/cross-compatible.  So, if you are looking to add additional Trendnet cameras to your network, make sure you read their website to make sure you are adding within the same group.With all of this, I decided to keep it simple and get the wired version without IR for my first foray into webcams.  If was easy to set-up and access through the computer and worked as it was supposed to.  However, my difficulty began when I realized that you need to know the IP address to access it from outside the home, and that all residential internet service has DYNAMIC IP ADDRESSES.  In all that I read about the cameras, I don't remember this being mentioned.  It is also not clear on the company's website.  Nor is it clear in the product literature, though it is mentioned.Here is a quick Primer on Dynamic DNS for those that do not know.  The IP address is essentially a numerical phone number for your computer.  Words, such as Amazon.com, when entered into a browser are quickly converted through a database look-up to the numbers and you are connected without ever knowing it.  Businesses pay extra to have the same number.  Residential users are assigned a new one each time you disconnect and reconnect your internet (log-off and log-on).  Therefore, the \"phone\" number changes.  From outside, to access the camera, you have to know the number to access the camera.  You could pay a lot of money for a Static (fixed) IP address, but  there is a free way around this.  There are companies that offer a fixed web address called dynamic DNS.  Once you have it set-up, the device regularly pings the service under your assigned web address and updates the IP address if it has changed.  You access your camera, through that web address (which then knows the current correct IP address).  Here is the process.1.  You can search for DYNAMIC DNS and get a list.  The one I went with was [...].2.  You go through registration process for a web address, for example [...].3.  Part of this registration will tell you, and have you click on, your current IP address.4.  Access the camera's server page (using the provided installation disk), go to Set-up, then Network.5.  Set a static IP address (such as one number higher than your computer's IP address, i.e.:If you have 192.168.1.5 give the Camera 192.168.1.6.  You can find your computer's IP address by double clicking the computer icon in the right lower task bar and then choose support).6.  Under DDNS Settings, click ENABLE, choose the DDNS provider that you are using.7.  Enter HOST NAME, for my example \"[...]\".  Then enter your User Name and Password.8.  Leave it on port 80.9.  The last part is different for every router.  You will have to research on your own on how to forward port 80 and possibly enable DMZ hosting (which limits access through your router to a specific device which adds security).In the end, the camera works as advertised.  The drop of one star was for the poor documentation for making the web connections.UPDATE:  January 22, 2011I have dropped my rating of this product from 4 to 2 stars.  The reason is that we get an interrupted stream all the time.  The camera is located at a 2nd home.  It does a great job of showing the outdoors (waterfront).  The active controls are only fully functional in IE, or IE emulation in Fire Fox.  The zoom is a digital zoom and at 2X is tolerable but heavily pixelated at 3X.  Up to this point it is doing what I needed it for.  However, the reason for the rating drop is that the stream locks up (freezes) in as little as 3-5 minutes.  So, when I go to access the camera, I have to go into the tool settings and reboot it.  Then I have a live image for about 3-5 minutes then it freezes again.  So, I am able to check the property, but only after a reboot each time which is very annoying.  It is hard wired to the router, we have tried updating the firmware and played with the settings to no avail.  We have not found a solution to this.  After reading many other reviews of this camera and its siblings from Trendnet, my conclusion is that it is a very buggy product.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Insecure.
