It lasted the first day and as another claimant said I also never took it below the water deeper than 2-3 feet, definitely NOT the 16 feet Fuji CLAIMS it can do, and my battery case was NOT open or unlocked since I made VERY sure of that before using it in the water and the next day it had condensation underneath the lens and would not take any more pictures. UNFORTUNATELY some how I lost my receipt and so I'm left with a 200 plus dollar paper weight now! Save your money and go to a dive supply website and get a real waterproof camera for just a bit more money. That's what I'm going to do.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE", "Author": "kgriffin11", "ReviewID": "R1XAX8QCSZ9HUB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If i could rate this no stars i would! The quiality of the pictures are horrible! Dont plan on having your picture turn out unless you have the absolute PERFECT lighting. This camera is the worst camera i have ever used!

But, once it started getting warm enough to go swimming, and I started taking it in the water, it started to not have as great quality of pictures. Then, out of the blue, at summer camp, water got into the battery compartment. THE BATTERY DOOR WAS CLOSED AND LOCKED. I made absolute certain of that before I went into the water. After that, it was never really water proof. I could bring it in for a little while and it would work, but if I submerged it about a foot under, there would be condensation on the inside and  I would have to dry it out. It had been working better, so I took it snorkeling and now it's completely dead.My mom bought the same camera, never brought it underwater, and it takes terrible pictures just generally.Crappy camera out of water, and doesn't really hold up to the \"waterproof\" standards.Save your money for a little while longer, and get a kodak or canon. Fujifilm not only doesn't have great products, but they don't want to give you any money back, even with a warranty.Now, I'm saving for this camera:[...]My mom now has it, it's cheap, but works super great. User friendly and takes great pictures no matter the lighting. I reccomend this, or really any other camera than the fujifilm.I just wish I had read the reviews before asking for it.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did not work when i got it", "Author": "GABRIEL HERRERA MACIAS", "ReviewID": "R1RVSI3S9DD3SV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hello i bought this camera but didnt used until i had my vacation (1 month after i got it) and whuen i turn it on in the screen was a message (zoom error) and just didnt work...
