I usually like to give a retailer a chance to correct any problems.  As of this afternoon, however, that ship has sailed.1) This camera died on me after one use.  I took it on a fishing vacation out of the country and was unable to photograph any of the fish I caught.  On the one occasion prior to that when the camera actually functioned, it took bad, grainy photos.2) I e-mailed Vivitar customer service three months ago to file a warranty claim.  They never responded.3) I then called their outsourced call center in India.  After a very long wait on hold, a woman with limited English skills attempted to help me, but (accidentally) hung up on me mid-call.4) I called again and spoke with another person and got the info I needed to ship the camera back to Vivitar for repair/replacement.5) I have called multiple times to get a status report and have been told repeatedly for the past 6 weeks \"your new camera is in the mail.\"6) I just called again and was told they can not locate a file with my claim.This is so ridiculous it would be funny if I weren't out a hundred bucks.Vivitar is the most incompetent company I have ever encountered.  I will never purchase any of their products ever again.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "<B>Megapixels:</B> 10.1 Megapixels\n<B>Display Features:</B> LCD Screen\n<B>Lens Features:</B> Auto Focus\n<B>Flash Features:</B> Auto On/Off\n<B>Display Size:</B> 2.4 \"\n<B>Zoom:</B> 0.
