I think 3 times optical zoom also falls into the same use category. The major camera manufacturers all have models like this in the same price range. I shopped around for a digital camera for quite a while and I bought the Nikon Coolpix 2200 and I highly recommend it as a high quality point and shoot camera.Pros: - Nikon has a great reputation. - It takes consistently good pictures in Automatic mode. - The menus are very readable and easy to navigate. - It comes with rechargeable bateries and a charger. - It is nice and small but easy to grip. - It feels solid and well made. - It has a 2-year warranty Cons: - NikonView software is not compatible with Windows 98 (my computer) - No manual shutter or aperture adjustmentMost of my pictures so far have been taken in Auto mode. There are lots of settings and options but it takes a while to get used to them. The camera offers scene modes that let you compensate for different lighting conditions. I took a picture of my house with the sun behind it and surprise, the house is all in shadows. Alot of my pictures were improved by using different settings the camera offers. Compared to other digitals, this camera has minimal delay in taking pictures. You can shoot a picture in about one and a half seconds or use one of the options to shoot continuous pictures. The best shot selector mode automatically picks the clearest shot for you.Another thing I'm happy about. Some cameras have lots of people complaining about their camera eating up batteries. I have been fooling around with the Nikon for about a week and taken hundreds of pictures and some movies too. Following a full charge, the low battery warning came on after a few days of almost constant use and then lasted for almost another day before it stopped working. The batteries and charger that come with it seem great. A full recharge only takes about two hours. My computer has Windows 98 so I can't use the Nikon software or download pictures directly from the camera to my computer. I can't use the camera's internal memory so I had to buy a memory card and card reader. The 128 MB card seems quite adequate too. The setting I am using gives me about 125 pictures per card.", "Date": "April 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1UHYYUSDFB5BM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently had problems with my Kodak CX6230 and finally ended up exchanging it for the Nikon 2200 and I am so happy I did.  It is smaller and has far more features.  Some that stand out are color modes in addition to standard are BW, Sepia, cyan, and vivid color.  There are also 15 scene modes which adjust the camera's settings for certain circumstances such as on a beach or indoors with low lighting.  Two things that definitely stand out are the panorama feature which allows you to take multiple photos which you can later overlap and form one long photo (it shows you a faint copy of your previous shot so you can line it up perfectly) and also the multi-shot feature which takes 16 shots in a very short time and gives you all of them in one frame which is fun.  The buttons are easy to use and although there are tons of menu options, you can stick with the auto mode which is quite simple.  This camera works well for a beginner or advanced user.  Finally, don't be turned off by the 2.0MP.  Prints come out great up to 8x10.  This camera is amazing.  I recommend it over the Kodak CX6230 (which is good but has less features and shorter battery life), Canon A60 (which has a LONG lag time between pressing the shutter and the shot being taken),  and HP 635 which are other cameras I researched and tried out.", "Date": "March 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Perfect For Field Trips", "Author": "K A Goode", "ReviewID": "R4Z87WYBFIR9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me preface this review by saying that this is my first digital camera. Being a longtime Nikon film camera user I began researching digital cameras. Using Consumer Reports, E-pinions, megapixel.net, and the reviews that I read here, it was clear that a 2-3 MP camera would suffice for my needs as they would any person whose prints rarely exceed 5X7 or 8X10. Don't be wooed by the store salesmen, some of them are honest and knowledgable but not all. Do the research and figure out what equipment will best suit your needs. I found this camera and a 256MB SD memory card for two-hundred and ten dollars (including rebates.)The camera is quite small and fits neatly in my backpack (in a carrying case), uses AA batteries (rechargeable recommended) and the memory card can be purchased almost anywhere. I've had the camera for a week and have taken it everywhere I go. The detail and picture quality are superb. I went to a Butterfly Conservatory and the pictures are just awesome, the color, clarity and detail can rival some of my friends 'high-end' cameras. As a few other reviewers have indicated Nikon has packed the camera with tons of extras. Take the time and read the manual. You'll be a better picture taker because of it. All in all, without plunking down loads of cash, this is an excellent entry-level digital camera that makes learning the ins and outs lots of fun!", "Date": "June 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera for the Price", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2OEA7P1VSVQ7S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the one to stop on!!!  If you're like me, you may be  completely overwhelmed by all of the choices in digital cameras.  I finally found this one on another site, and then came back here to read the reviews (the price was better too).  I got it two days after my daughter was born, and found out how quickly you can use up a memory card and batteries!The pictures have been great!  I got the cheepest 64mb SD card I could find ($28) and a set of ni-mh rechargeable batteries for $10.  They both work great with the camera.  The card holds about 75 pictures and the batteries will last through about two cards between charges.  Since the set came with four batteries, I'm always charged!  I've already printed off some 8x10's and they're in perfect shape.If you are looking for an inexpensive, easy to use, great quality camera, this is the one!", "Date": "May 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great digital camera", "Author": "\"es71625344\"", "ReviewID": "R2XL4B002LO0N7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera in the mail today after about 3 months of researching for the right one.  I finally decided to get this one along with the Viking secure digital card for a total of about $150 (including the rebate).  It truly does help to skim through the manual to get a hang of the camera.  The CD-ROM will cover the rest!Here are some specs:Pros:> Scene selection allows you to choose the specific function for specific occasions (museum, party, sunset, etc.)> Warnings for if the picture might get blurry or if lighting is poor> Ergonomic design allows easy handling> Great CD-ROM that gives a good rundown on the camera and the program it comes with> Battery power is quite impressive, I've spent all day taking pictures and it's still going strong> Relatively light and compactCons:> Functions may be a little overwhelming for a first-timer> Nowadays, 2 MP may not be enough even for the average amateur photographer> LCD screen gets a little grainy sometimesOverall, this is a good digital camera for recreational purposes.  For me, I found the camera was a good deal for the price.  I was especially pleased by the \"panorama\" option that lets you take a series of pictures and arrange them into a 360 degree panorama in the Nikon View program.  There are definitely lots of possibilities with this little camera!", "Date": "June 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "I Love This Camera!", "Author": "Fuzzbean", "ReviewID": "R2T9AYOU2MR6YL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one of these a couple months ago, and I think it's great. I have considerable experience with an older 1.4 MP Olympus, and also a 2 MP Casio and a 4 MP Minolta, and this beats the heck out of all of them.It's far smaller and handier than any of them.It's much cheaper than those cameras were new.It has optical zoom, which I believe is much superior to digital zoom and probably makes this equal in many ways to a 3+ megapixel camera with only digital zoom.It takes SUPER close-up pictures of flowers, fingerprints, etc.It takes pictures in near-total darkness -- while hand held no less -- that appear adequately sharp and much brighter than the scenes appeared to my eyes when I took them.It takes great photos of fireworks without any special setting.Unlike the other digital cameras I used before, it DOES NOT exaggerate the contrast between sunlit and shaded areas. No more faces turned into featureless blackness by what appeared to my eyes to be minor shadows.The power switch is a good design -- it's recessed and separate from the rotary mode switch. Some other cameras I've used or looked at had exposed power switches or had \"OFF\" as one of many positions on an easily-bumped rotary mode switch. The way all digital cameras eat batteries, you don't want to turn them on by accident.On the down side, it could have had snappier \"clicks\" on the mode switch to avoid the minor annoyance of turning on the camera in the wrong mode. It could have had a handy switch to turn the display screen off, allowing you to save power while taking pictures with the viewfinder. The viewfinder could be sealed against the entry of dust better; some dust got into mine. And it could have come with a case, which I know they could have made in China for less than a dollar.But overall I think this is a great camera and an excellent compromise between price, quality, and size. I use it largely for e-mailing photos of my life in Japan back to my family, but it has enough of those pixel things to make decent-sized prints too. I recommend it highly.", "Date": "September 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent casual camera with minor issues", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R27QPFCSPRFE76", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a simple point-and-shoot camera that I could leave on auto mode most of the time. This camera takes sharp pictures and works well in auto mode IF you are outdoors or have lots of daylight coming through a window when you are indoors. If you are indoors with poor lighting, using the flash sometimes results in either dim or very cold pictures. What I do when I am indoors is turn off the flash and increase the exposure compensation by +1.0 EV or so. You'll have to hold the camera still or the blur detection will come on giving you the option to save or delete the picture. Or you can use the Best Shot Selector to take up to 10 pictures continuously, then it only saves the clearest one. Pictures come out warm and natural looking without the flash. You can also experiment with the indoor or night portrait assist modes to get similar results. Here are some other thoughts on the camera:Pros:- The scene modes work suprisingly well.- VERY small, light and compact.- Zoom can be seen with optical viewfinder.- Camera has one-button instant auto-transfer. USB transfer is quick.- Haven't tried an SD card yet, but pictures are written quickly to the internal memory.- Price. Got it for $155 totalCons:- No button to turn LCD on and off. Must go to setup menu.- Weak flash with short range.- Viewfinder is inaccurate. Cuts off the edges. LCD is fine, though.- Hard to hold if you have big hands.- Alkalines die fast. Get some NiMH rechargebles.- Wristrap is useless and just gets in the way. Wish it came with a neck strap.- NikonView software is sparse. You will definitely want Photoshop or PSP. Did come with Arcsoft PhotoImpressions 4.0, though.I thought about getting the 3.2 MP 3200 for $70 more but settled with this camera since I rarely do 8x10, didn't have a need for more detail, and just wanted a casual point-and-shoot. 3200 also has sound, voice memo, and AF assist lamp. Not a big lost to me but some might want the extra features.Lastly, you will want a small bag like the Tamrac 4390.

I researched cameras within my price range and I was debating between this camera and one with a 3 megapixel of a different brand. The reviews for this one sold me, and I bought it. I am quite pleased with this camera. Although it is 2 megapixels, the picture quality is excellent -- even better than my old Sony camera which was a 3 megapixel. The pictures turn out crisp and clear even on a lower resolution setting. Another thing I like about the camera is the weight. Or should I say, the lack of weight. It is the lightest camera of a decent size that I've held thus far. This makes it extremely portable. The settings are also excellent. There is a mode where you can choose a particular light setting and shutter speed based on the type of envrionment you are in (eg: party, fireworks, cloudy, sunrise, sunset...) The bottom line is that this camera is great.

I liked the cameras small size.  I'm quite happy with the image quality of a printed 8x10.  I don't have a use for anything larger.  I found a couple of the features very useful.  Best shot selector shoots up to 10 still images then saves the sharpest.  Nice for intances where you can't use flash or can't see the LCD screen.  The camera can make a copy your pictures in a lower resolution. Just select the smaller size and the image is ready for email.  I found the 3X zoom a bit small, maximum focal length is 14.1mm  I've seen 2X cameras with more magnification.  The flip of that is the wide angle is real wide.  The macro setting can shoot incredibly close.  1 inch or 1 foot when zoomed.  The camera did have a little trouble locking foucus in macro mode when subject(flower) did not fill image area.

It shares the same excellent body and Nikkor lens as the 3MP Cooolpix 3200 and 4MP 4100, which cost up to 2 times the price. Using an analogy to cars, it's like getting a $10,000 car that shares the same chassis and design as a fancier, souped-up $20,000 variant.The trend to smaller cameras and camcorders, as well as cost savings, means that the CCD is getting tinier. The 2200 uses 1/3.2\" CCD, while most are 1/2.7\" (as in 3200). Smaller CCD means more noise, so 2200 shoots mostly in ISO 50 to minimize noise, unless in low light when it falls back to ISO 200 - extremely noisy picture. A year ago, most cameras had 1/1.8\" CCD, although noise reduction wasn't as advanced back then, so the results should be similar. The Coolpix is ideal for outdoor daytime shots, but don't expect too much indoors or at night.  (Sidenote: Panasonic first achieved an under $1000 3CCD camcorder by reducing the CCD size. No 3 CCD setup has used such a tiny imager, and the compromise was not enough resolution for adequate digital image stabilization.)Smaller CCDs also allows smaller zoom lenses, but relatively, they must be made with more precision as small distortions will be less tolerable than on a larger lens set. The lens on the 2200 seems fine to me. What I first thought as lens softness is actually the severe JPEG compression... I prefer 2 Mega Pixel jpegs of about 1000KB, but the 2200 squeezes it to 500~700KB each. Memory is so cheap these days, and hopefully the compression ratio can be relaxed in future firmware upgrades.Strangely, some Coolpix 2200/3200/4100 I saw are Made in Japan, while some are Made in China. This indicates that the series is either made by Nikon itself, or at least by a quality Japanese OEM maker such as Sanyo. Even if you get one made in China, it's good to know that it comes from a factory operated by Nikon or Sanyo, not sourced from an unknown OEM, as is common in this price range.I also looked at an alternative \"budget\" digital camera, the Optio 30 by Pentax. It's a 3-Megapixel camera that costs $30 more. It is not as elegant in design as the Coolpix 2200, but it does have 2 important features. One is live histogram, which shows you if the exposure is favorable. The other feature is automatic interval shooting (Lapse-time Photography). You can set the Pentax to shoot a picture every X seconds. Subjects of the sequence can be a flower budding, your pet running around the house while you're out, the sunset, your documented trip to the supermaket (camera mounted inside the car windshield), or, if you have an radio controlled helicopter/plane/blimp, a bird's eye view (you don't need an extra radio channel to trigger the camera). Since you can take about 300 2-megapixel pictures with the 256MB card, without the cost of film, you can really set the camera to work automatically and forget about it.If you're after a simple camera for 4 X 6\" prints that's designed like a jewel, I recommend the Coolpix 2200. If you want to explore advanced features digital photography offers, get the Pentax, although you will have to give up the curvy, grip-friendly design for a boxy one.", "Date": "June 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "what an upgrade from a HP camera that is only 2 years old", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2P7R8TJSQ7C8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an HP 315 and this new Nikon absolutely blows it away and it was like $150.00 less that I paid just 2 years ago.

Most people have no need for anything fancier.2) The price.  Nikon is known for their quality, and the price for this camera, given all the great settings and features, is outstanding.3) The other models I was looking at (esp. the Canon A75, and related) seemed to have serious reliability issues (read other Amazon reviews for them).4)  The battery life is excellent, compared with what I've read for other cameras - I put in a freshly charged set of NiMH batteries when I got it, and I've taken over 100 pictures, and probably 10 minutes worth of movies, and they're still kicking.5) The images are good.  They're not perfect, but I think they're just as good as the images I was getting with a Canon G3 I used for a few months.  All cameras will have problems focusing in low-light conditions.6) When it was shipped to my house, it sat outside in below-freezing weather for hours, because DHL is stupid, apparently, and even though there was condensation from the temperature change when I brought it inside, it still worked fine - so it's evidently tougher than many other models, according to what I've read about them.Accessories I'd recommend:-A NiMH charger with 4 batteries-A 256mb SecureDigital memory card-A decent camera case (it's worth the 6 dollar investment to protect your camera)This camera has great features, takes great pictures, is very compact, and comes with good manuals and even a DVD showing step-by-step how to use it.  People that complain about the interface being complicated would probably experience difficulty using a toaster.  I find it to be very user-friendly.Bottom line: If you're unsure about whether you need something larger than 2 MP, you probably don't.  I would definitely recommend this camera, although it might be worth looking at the Coolpix 3200, if you think you need 3MP and sound on your movies, and you have the extra $30 or $40.", "Date": "January 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "A phenomenal little camera", "Author": "J.

I did not get the cable, but you can buy SD card readers or multi card type readers. You can get a reader just for SD cards for $3.00 or less at a computer fare or on Ebay. A multi-purpose reader should get cost you around $8 or so. You can then transfer pictures to your computer. You can also have pictures read and printed at places like Rite Aid.SD cards are now much bigger than when this camera came out, and I quickly replaced the 16 megabyte SA card with a 1 gigabyte one. The camera can take also a 2 gigabyte card. You won't need to replace the card for a long long time, like a year or two. The camera will probably break before the card is full. You can put the card in another Nikon camera and it will take up where it left off.The camera keeps a continous log of all pictures that it has ever taken up to the number 9999. That number is the last 4 digits of the file name before the extension. (Most files are *.JPGs, but teh mtion pictures are *.MOV files also called Quicktime)The pictures are saved in a directory or folder called 100NIKON. That continues until it has 200 pictures. Then it goes to 101NIKON and so on up to 999NIKON although I don't know if that number has been reached by anyone anywhere in the world. Anytime a picture with a lower number than the highest number in the highest numbered directory is added to the SD card, a new directory or folder is also created. So when I copied some older pictures to the SD card, keeping the old numbers they were put in a new directory (or folder) even thiouygh there were only 3 pictures in the old one.If you switch cameras and the new camera has a higher number than the old one, it will add the pictures in the same place - otherwise it wil create a new folder.You can also add other pictures to the card but put them in a different directory than what Nikon uses or you might not be able to see many pictures in your viewfinder. You can also use the the SD card in its reader (that you buy) as an ordinary flash drive as some people have discovered and it is probably better than a regular flash drive in that you don't have to worry about damaging the connection to the USB port.You should copy the pictures to a computer for safety and backup. You can use any kind of program to look at the pictures and you can view small images of the pictures in the camera itself.There is a very big problem with all digital cameras. The LCD screen can break. It can break rather soon and apparently Nikon does not repair it for free considering it the result of mishandlingh and not copvered by its warranty. I encountered other people who had the same problem of an LCD camera breaking.For this reason I recommend buying a 4 or 5 year old camera on Ebay and replacing it if the LCD breaks.After using this camera about half a year the LCD screen suddenly stopped working. (I think it got pressed the wrong way in my coat pocket when i was sitting in a bus) The camera is not useless then, and there is no need to throw it over a bridge. Pictures are much more likely be overexposed then (if taken outside) and you get no immediate feedback then, even feedback as to that a picture was successfully taken and it is very hard to get any pictures out of internal memory then. I took some pictures after the LCD screen (viewfinder) broke and I found it took very good pictures indoors.I bought a Nikon 3200 for about $40 including shipping on Ebay. This is almost the same except that it can take video with sound. If I knew how to do that. Maybe it is automatic.If you get this camera you will be discovering new features for quite some time.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "surprising", "Author": "amoc", "ReviewID": "RIHSWF3461TRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i was skeptical due to friends advice to get the most pixels- but i only take pics for fun and send them to family through email :) its great! and petite like me :)highly recommended for an amateur as their first camera!", "Date": "July 17, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2-megapixel resolution for photo-quality 8 x 10-sized enlargements\n3x optical Zoom-Nikkor lens with 4x digital zoom\nIn-camera cropping; Quicktime movie mode without audio\nStore images on 14.5 MB internal memory or optional Secure Digital (SD) cards (not included)\nPowered by 2 AA-size batteries (alkaline included; rechargeable Ni-MH recommended); connects to computers via USB", "Name": "Nikon Coolpix 2200 2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/2186GRDHW4L.jpg", "ProductID": "B0001ARH0U"}}
