It easily fits into a pocket for quick access and convenience  rather than rifling through a purse or bag.  I set it on 'Auto' and every picture adjusted itself to the situation.  I am impressed with the overall performance, however, the only (somewhat) minor drawback is the fact that it seems to use up the AA batteries rather quickly.  I will purchase a better quality battery, one recommended for digital camera use, in the near future to see if that reduces the need to carry extra batteries with me.  Otherwise, I highly recommend purchasing this camera and would purchase the same exact camera again if I needed another one.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Couple Problems", "Author": "Pracilla_bear", "ReviewID": "R32XGMCMT6GKEU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The pictures taken are GREAT and it's nice for younger beginners but the video is awful. It cannot be paused and the volume isn't the best. The bottom bar that holds the batteries on mine is BREAKING OFF and my buttons curved in. The zoom is great, the display is great, so I recommend it to younger children if they want to know what it is like to take pictures (flash is extraordinary), but the engineering and video is a great loss for such a potential product. But honestly I want to throw mine away, it's damaging itself ):", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A $78 wonder", "Author": "Ron Gacek", "ReviewID": "R149B6U083O7QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Fuji only cost me $78 and am 100% satisfied with the quality of videos and photos it takes.
