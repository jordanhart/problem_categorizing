This little camera is just what I needed and wanted. It takes really nice pictures and most importantly, its a snap to use. I ended purchasing an extra battery, but to my surprise, the standard battery is capable of taking over 200 shots before needing a recharge. I'm impressed. The lcd screen is cystal clear and very bright. For the money, you just can't go wrong. I wanted a small point & shoot camera because I got tired of having to deal with large camera cases, lens covers and all of the gadgetry required to take picture with my other digital camera. This is small, very simple to use, takes great photos and fits in a shirt pocket. You just turn it on and go. You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "May 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Updated review", "Author": "J. S. Schlatter \"jschlat\"", "ReviewID": "R19WB2OS4TDYCX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 5/5/07  As mentioned below, my original W90 had some issues.  After exchanging the camera, I can verify that my original was bad and the new one performed much better.  However, even the new one had serious grain issues in all but the brightest light in \"AUTO\" mode.  In program mode, flash pictures also looked flat and grainy unless you manually reduced the ISO to 200.  I really wanted to like this camera, but after struggling with the second camera for a week, I decided to return it and bought a Canon 800IS.  In my opinion, the Canon is significantly better in all but near dark conditions.  The image stabilization on the Canon is also significantly better.I had my choices narrowed down between a Canon and the Sony W90.  My daughter has an older P200 Sony and it takes fantastic pictures so I opted for the W90.  The first few daylight pictures I took showed color blotching (not noisy or grainy) when viewed at actual size on the computer.  Low light photos also had MUCH more noise visible than the P200 even at ISO 200.  I have now taken ~1000 pictures in all lighting conditions and would rate the camera as follows:  Bright light/ daylight outside:  Excellent pictures  Medium light /clouds:  Very good to excellent  Dusk and night shots:  Amazing! especially with high ISO setting  Medium/Low indoor lighting:  good (with post processing)  Indoor lighting with flash:  Grainy with auto setting, Good with 200ISOI was initially disappointed that the picture quality with indoor lighting without flash was not as good as my daughters P200.  However after many test shots comparing the two, I believe the major difference is that the W90 takes a lighter picture with more detail while the P200 is darker with more noise reduction done inside the camera.  Any simple photo program can remove the noise and make the pictures as good with at least as much (or more) detail than the P200.  Note that these pictures were taken at a low room light level that would normally require flash so this will likely rarely or never be an issue for most users.Although I have not taken many pictures with flash, all I have taken have turned out very crisp and well lit with no noticeable noise.  The  noise issue above is ONLY with low light and no flash.The dusk and night shots were what really impress.  I took about a dozen hand-held shots after sunset. Although about 1/2 of the shots were blurry due to my hands shaking, the other 1/2 were excellent with good exposure and excellent detail and no detectable blurring.  Obviously the image stabilization can only do so much.  The pictures were obviously grainy (ISO1600) at actual size zoom on the computer, but looked good when viewing the whole picture.  I emphasize that these were taken in lighting that my daughter's ISO400 camera just would not have been able to take at all.Several of the options are also very handy.  The ability to select the light metering point is extremely useful when shooting at sunset or with lighted objects at night.  The camera allows either full frame, center frame, or center point metering.  Similar options are available for focus.Continual burst mode was actually useful as the camera takes pictures quickly.  I was able to capture a bird from perched to about 5' in the air using the burst mode (~4 pictures)all with excellent clarity and capturing the birds wings without blur.If it were not for the color blotching at ISOs from 125 to 400 I would give this 5 stars.  I have decided to exchange this camera for another to see if I just have one that is defective.  It is such an obvious problem that others would have certainly mentioned it if it was a design flaw.", "Date": "April 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony DSC-W90", "Author": "V. Caarlsoon", "ReviewID": "RJM3HD98M26CZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for 3 weeks now. I love it. It turns on and is ready to shoot very quickly. Much faster than my Canon G2. After reading the manual, I found it very easy to use. It does remarkably well in ambient light. The steady shot feature seems to really work well. The camera is so small yet feels good to hold. I especially like the menu that shows up on the screen which is easy to read and tells you what the setting does. I don't have to remember everything. The larger screen is great for viewing plus it has a view finder for shooting outside in the bright sunshine. Two weeks ago I shot nearly 500 pictures at an art show. Only one was not in focus. I started shooting with the flash on, but then tried several with ambient indoor lighting and finished the show with mostly natural light shots. This last weekend I used it at my class reunion shooting people. The face recognition did a good job. On shots of 10 ft. or more the flash was weak. I don't expect the flash in a shirt pocket camera to be very strong. So far I have not used the movie feature. I am surprised at how long that small battery lasts. It is good to have the battery indicator showing the remaining charge.One feature I wish the W90 had is the ability to turn off the screen and have it show the picture just taken briefly and then shut off again. That probably would save on the battery. Also, if shooting every few minutes, one could disable the auto shut off and leave the camera on for the duration instead of turning it off and on frequently.This is the first time I have bought a camera without a card. Usually there is some small useless card with the camera and you have to run out and buy a larger one. This camera does not come with a card so I ordered the 2 gig memory stick along with it as a package.", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "I love my W90!! Red eye issues but they can be corrected right on the camera.", "Author": "J. Jeroszko", "ReviewID": "R1TJDSKEBRKYLQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded to this from the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50. They have made some great improvements but they have made some changes that I don't like also, which is why I give this 4 stars and not 5.If you're looking for a small point-and-shoot camera, this one is great, but it definitely has red eye issues for indoor pics with the flash, so be warned! The good news though is that this camera has red-eye removal software right in the camera. I would say it works about 80% of the time, which I think is very good. The rest I just remove in Photoshop or Shutterfly.I did some research online and talked to some camera experts and I found out that red-eye is a very common problem with these small point-and-shoot cameras. It's unfortunately just the way this camera is designed - the lens is just so close to the flash.If you buy this, definitely get a big 1 gig (or bigger) card so you can hold lots of pictures and video. Also I would recommend a 2nd battery so when 1 is charging in the wall, you can be using the other one.PROS- Small and compact- Very slick design & very attractive (I have the black one)- Good menu navigation- Good photo quality, especially outdoors- Red Eye Removal Software right in camera- I love the Lithium Batteries - Great battery life- Image Stabilizer and Face Detection - not as many blurry pics as the W50- Decent Zoom- 8 megapixels- Video with sound- Lots of different modes, although I never use them- TimerCONS- Major red-eye issues- Still some blurry photos with flash off- I can't crop the videos!!! :( I could with my W50. I don't know why they removed this great feature. I am VERY disappointed.- The video mic is in such a stupid spot - on the top right where your right finger sits - so if you don't think so move it, the sound on the video is muffled. It was on the top left on the W50 which was also stupid because that is where your left finger sits. WHY can't it just be on the front where your finger would never be?- Why did they move the battery/card door to the side? I liked it much better on the bottom like the W50. On the side, I am always accidentally opening it up.- The menu wheel is much better on this than the W50. They have it more embedded now so it can't move as easily on it's own. Thank goodness!I really do love these Sony Cybershot cameras. I've tried Olympus, Canon, and Kodak and I just like Sony's better. ALL of these little cameras have red eye issues, no matter what brand.", "Date": "December 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!!  Few Quirks", "Author": "D. Culbertson", "ReviewID": "R2V8D5FDD4YXTV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Over all, a great camera with an excellent (and sophisticated) design - with no complaints, well perhaps a few. Zoom (In/Out) function doesn't seem to work with movie mode. Takes great pictures, images are crisp, colors come out vibrant and there are many modes to meet most situations. The 1/2000 shutter time isn't as fast as I thought it would be or hoped for. So, if your planning on taking pictures of anything moving (even moving slowly) you may want to invest in an affordable SLR camera instead as most images that move will not come out the way you hoped. Also, and this is a big PLUS, if you take pictures often in near dark or poorly lit areas - this camera feature ISO 3200 which allows you to take pictures in very low light conditions. The feature is \"NOT\" night vision, so don't expect miracles if your in pitch black and so is your screen. :) Lastly, the zoom is a little quirky - it is an optical 3x zoom (blah, everyday common zooming power) but unlike other cameras that also have a digital zoom that will allow you to further zoom in, with this digital zoom after you have exhausted your 3x, this camera will only allow you to do 3x optical when viewfinding and the digital zoom can only seemingly be used AFTER you take the picture and begin to view and enhance it. *pretty crummy I thought* It also has a viewfinder screen that is pretty large and provides easy previewing of photos.To summarize: If your looking for a sophisticatedly styled feature packed camera, this is for you. I've got alot of Ooooo's and Ahhhhh's from people who liked it very much. If you require more zooming power, faster shutter speed or movie mode where you can use your zoom while recording, investigate other options out there.I like my Sony Cybershot W90 and will keep it and be satisfied, but now I know why people spend the extra money on SLR cameras and in the future will invest in one myself.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony W90 = A+", "Author": "Mike Johnson \"mjohnson\"", "ReviewID": "RMVS4F5M3B6K9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this camera for a couple of weeks now and I really love it.

It has the heft of a metallic finish and with the black color its very sweet.2) Interface and UI design. Kudos to Sony here, easy to use !!! pretty much went through a bunch of shooting options without even looking at Manual. Sp. Mention : the UI wheel with the description tags :))3) Great audio alerts to enhance the user feedback.4) Best of all GREAT PICS.Overall its pretty versatile, though not as versatile as the A640 . But that is precisely why i choose this camera. I do not want a gazillion functions that i dont need. Its a snap shooter that i need to pull out and take a pic with real quick. Fast access to its capabilites along with great battery life and awesome pics.Aditionally, its very well built and has a solid/high quality feel to it.

The new 1/2.5\" sensors just don't capture as much light.  Most indoor shots had a hideous amount of noise.  Close-up shots with flash looked decent though (as in shot from a foot away using a compact tripod).  From 6 feet away, ugh, even with lots of light flooding in from the windows plus the flash.  I'm returning it, which Amazon makes surprisingly easy.  The W200 has a larger sensor so I might give it a try, though cramming 12MP onto it might negate its size advantage.Further reading on dpreview (which Amazon recently bought) confirmed my suspicions with their \"Compact Camera High ISO Modes\" article.  Too many pixels crammed into much too small an image sensor.  That's why the older Sony cameras take better pictures.

It's really easy to use, and so far I have gotten nothing but great results from it. There are also some higher level features if you know anything about how to manually set a camera, but they are somewhat hidden in the program since I imagine that most people who chose a \"point and shoot\" aren't looking to get too manual with it. It also seems pretty durable. I spend a lot of time outdoors and in the woods, so my cameras take a beating in my backpack and so far this one has lived up to my expectations and more. If you're just looking for a really nice, solid point and shoot camera with a ton of features... you've found my recommendation right here. My only additional recommendation is that, if you purchase this camera, you should purchase an additional battery as well... especially if you are planning to travel with it.

Goklaney", "ReviewID": "R2HFM2E2GIM70C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all, I would like to announce that with this model, Sony started manufacturing their cameras in China.  I had bought the DSC W5 for my father over a year ago and a DSC W80 for my sister 6 months ago, and both were made in Japan, and both have functioned flawlessly.  Not the case with the DSC W90.  If you don't believe that China's incredibly high acceptable defect rate doesn't affect Sony's quality, read on.Keep in mind that I bought this camera new and have taken meticulous care of it, keeping it protected in a padded Sony case away from extremes of temperature or humidity.  Within the first 2 months of ownership, I used the camera twice.  The first time I used it was on a trip to Washington, DC, where it functioned well (I took 30 to 40 pictures).  However, on my second trip, I went to Atlanta, and after taking about 20 pictures, the camera shut off with lens in full extension.  It would never start up again, and the lens wouldn't retract.  I fully charged the battery and again, it never would start up (the led would flash for a second and go off).I called Sony Customer Service, and they determined that I needed to send it in for servicing to Sony's repair subcontractor, Precision Camera.  I sent it in, and Precision Camera called me once to tell me that they received it.  After that I heard nothing from them.  Despite 3 calls to Precision Camera, (you automatically get voicemail, and they never return the call), they kept my camera a total of 30 days, yet they stated that they could not reproduce the problem that I had.  Beware of Precision Camera's lies displayed on their website: \"Our fast turnaround gets your camera returned to you quickly so you may once again digitally capture life's simple moments or videotape every momentous occasion.\"Despite multiple calls to Sony Customer Service, I was unable to get my camera in time for 2 trips that I took during that month.  Given that they manufactured a lemon that failed in the first two months of ownership, Sony should have bought the camera back or issued me a new one if it could not be repaired within one month.  In total, I spoke with Sony's offshore customer service reps a total of 6 times.  (Thanks a lot to Beej, Peggy, Sabrina, Sugar, Faith, and Robert, if these are their real names).  Finally, today I received my camera.  Although Prec. Camera said that there was nothing wrong with it, they managed to scratch the lens casing while performing whatever shady repair they did on the camera.  Now it works, but because it is a lemon, and they didn't tell me what repair they did on it, I am quite concerned that it will fail when I go to Germany in January.

I was shopping around for nice cameras at the stores, and I eventually decided upon this one. It's a pretty straightforward Camera. I wouldn't recommend this to hard-core camera enthusiasts as there are clearly better ones on the market. My only peeve with the camera is that sometimes certain things do end up a bit brighter than they should be, but most of the time the pictures come out nicely. It's pretty small too, so you can keep it in your pocket quite nicely (it's smaller than my wallet).The camera has different modes, which may be a bit overwhelming to some users but a bit of experimentation with the modes will tell you which one to use for what occasion. You have an \"auto\" mode which will adjust the specifications for the best shot, but there are other modes for different specialties, such as long range shots, winter shots, etc.It's a bit pricey, (I actually got this for about $230 at Circuit City since it was marked for an Owner's discount), and I feel that the camera is not worth it's $300 retail tag, so I suggest that you try to shop around or jump on the occasion if it's cheap.Overall, if you just want to take some nice pictures but not professionally, this is a great camera.Be sure to pick up a memory stick duo, preferably a 1 or 2 GB model as the camera doesn't come with one.", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Guido Hernandez Salas \"ghernandez\"", "ReviewID": "R3RXE0AE8W4HH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony Cybershot DSCW90 8.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot (Black)Excellent camera", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very noisy, saturated colors, out of focus in autofocus", "Author": "Ignacio Martini", "ReviewID": "R3RRYI6LX4NIAM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I sent it back twice to get repaired, each time they called me saying there was nothing wrong with the camera, but they agreed the indoors pictures were noisy...

I wanted to upgrade to get better video and better megapixel.  And the camera does fine in those respect.  I have no complaint in terms of its picture quality.However, compared to the P72, this one is terrible in terms of user interface.  Why?1.  It has a terrible menu navigation system.  With the old one, I hit menu and everything is there, in a really understandable format.  (This was one reason I always felt that my Sony was superior to the Canons out there.  I've always found the Canon menu really hard to navigate.)This new one has a \"home\" menu as well as menu button.  It's very confusing and I can't find the things I want all the time because I don't know which menu I need to look under.2.  It doesn't allow you to print the date on the picture itself.  I have the Sony digital printer and I had to manually set it there in order to see it.  But this means that I can't see it when I just view the pictures.3.  Sony decided to go the route of Canon and added the wheel with preset shooting conditions.  I was fine with the presents being right under the menu button before.  This made for a very small navigation area.4.  For some reason, they didn't put the \"view pics\" under the wheel.  So now there's one extra button crowding the navigation area.5.  You have to buy special batteries now.  That was the one thing I *loved* about the old camera.  It took regular rechargeable AA batteries.  Sure, the batteries died fast, but I could recharge them or buy lots of AAs on the cheap.  Now if I want extra batteries, I have to go buy an expensive one.6.  I had to buy a new memory stick.  It's not sony's fault really that they came up w/ a better format.  But I had lots of the old memory sticks and was indignant to find that I had to shell out more money now to buy new ones.7.  It no longer has an email format.  Yet another GREAT thing about the old camera.  You can choose email format and it'll save 2 pictures for every shot, one in regular size, and one for sending it through email.  The DSC-W90 does not allow you to do this so I now have to shrink every picture that I send out manually.All in all, I'm disappointed with the functionality of the camera.  Sure, the picture qualities are fine.  But I find that I don't take pictures as much because I get so frustrated when I try to use the navigation tools or try to find features that existed in my old camera but not my new one.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "learned to love it :)", "Author": "Dana", "ReviewID": "R24SPAHQCPW039", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about two weeks now and i have to admit when i first got it i was a little afraid that it wasnt going to live up to the standards of the camera i was replacing it with.

Quick summary the new W line offers some improved performance, lighter pictures (better flash performance) compared to the previous darker cybershots cameras. However in this new W line. The menu system is NOT simple but more complex and in addition Sony removed the battery time remaing!!! Pffft, that does the user alot of good. Again Sony's greed shows prompting the user to get a faster charger and buying an additional battery becuase the user can not rely and guess the time remaining. I will give this camera a try if picture quality is anything like the negative reviews I will return and settle with the tried and proven W55.
