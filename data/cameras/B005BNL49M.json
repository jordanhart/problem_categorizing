These were definitely a better quality.  They were an easier setup, finish was better, and they provided more features.  They work equally well day or night (range at night limited) and are well supported by desktop and mobile apps.  If you are installing as a first time camera user read the instructions!  Twice! Be familiar with your router's Port Assignment procedures.  Lot's of options...pick the one that's right for you.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the $$", "Author": "tomk", "ReviewID": "R22UVKHHFKZV6N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "THe camera can be dificult to set up if your not familiar with networking. Aside from that, the video and pictures are adequate. If you want these camera's for sound,forget it. Basically useless in that category. One of the three crackles and pops like it has a short circuit and the other two are barely audible to any listener and or from any speaker to you. (if not within a foot or so from the unit).", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$379.99", "Features": null, "Name": "3 Pack Foscam FI8918W Wireless IP Camera with Pan & Tilt, Night Vision, 2 Way Audio, Apple Mac and Windows compatible--White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LlL%2BKvR1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005BNL49M"}}
