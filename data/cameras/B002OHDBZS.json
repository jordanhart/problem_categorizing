As a constant companion this system cannot be beaten.  With the DA pancake lenses attached, the K-7 is small and unobtrusive.  Yet it is a powerful photographic tool.  Every feature needed by an experienced photographer is found on this body.  Plus a few extra.  Also, it has fully auto modes so you can easily hand it to a less experienced user and simply say \"point and shoot\".  For years, to have a rugged weather proof camera meant hauling around an enormous body.  The K-7 is built like a tank yet is small and light.  I have carried it for at least 100 miles of hiking (not all in one day) and it is a joy.  Easily hangs behind my arm while walking on the street so it is always ready.Performance is fast and reliable in all conditions indoors and out.  Note: startup time can be greatly improved to near instant by turning off the shake reduction feature when not needed.As an added bonus, the \"kit\" lens included with this body is exceptional.  I think Canon and Nikon take pride in providing the most ridiculously crappy lenses in their \"kits\".  So much plastic you can't even use them as paper weights.  But this Pentax 18-55 is amazing!  Weather sealing, smooth manual focus action, and astonishingly high quality optics.As a compact, all purpose system for travel and constant carry, the K-7 plus a couple tiny DA lenses is a pleasure.  You can argue over image quality all day.  But the reality is that you have to have the camera with you to get the image.  And this system is small enough and tough enough that it will always be ready when needed.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "My choice over Canon or Nikon", "Author": "John Petersen", "ReviewID": "R2546DOZG3290E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will leave all the technical reviews for other people.  I went to a lot of camera stores before making my choice.  Every single store recommended the Canon or the Nikon over the Pentax.  But I had read a lot of great reviews on the net and the selection of lenses for the Pentax covered all my needs.  The big deciding factors for me were:1-  Build construction which is far superior to the Nikon or Canon2-  Size.  Smaller than the other two and much nicer to hold and feels better in the hand.3-  Weather proofing.  I had to take some pictures on the beach the other day with a friend who has a Canon.  It started to rain and my friend had to scurry for cover.  I was able to finish the shots and not worry about the camera getting a little wet.4-  Lenses.  I really like the selection of Pentax lenses.  They seem better value for money and the DA* series is great.  When you boil down the selection of what you really need or can use on your camera the Nikon or Canon selection is not as huge as it looks unless you are a sports photographer and need a super long lens.  Plus you can use older lenses and I have bought a couple of older second hand lenses like a super wide angle that I do not use often, but enjoy to have.5-  Value for money.  Pentax gives you a much better camera at this price level than Canon or Nikon.Image quality from what I have seen to very close between all the better cameras.  With any of these cameras you have to read the manual and practice using the camera to make the most of it.  With a little practice now I am finding the layout of the controls on the Pentax brilliant and can quickly and easily make any of the adjustments I need.  There are so many great and clever features that I really enjoy.  The shops also made a big deal about the mode dial on the Canon and Nikon.  This is great for beginners and the Pentax is more a Prosumer camera.  But the Pentax has these same setting in the menu if you want them and we sometimes use them for general shooting.I love this camera.  It does not look like a big hunk of plastic sitting there and has a quality feel to it.  It is very easy to learn to use and the resulting photos are fantastic even with the kit lens.  My best recommendation is to go to a shop and hold the Pentax side by side with the Canon and Nikon and you will see the differences I have noted above.  It really swings the decision to the Pentax.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Glad I splurged!", "Author": "niamert", "ReviewID": "R2ZI6AIE69BYAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had a point-and-shoot camera in the past. I had been wanting a DSLR for a while now, and planned on purchasing one with my tax refund this year. I was debating between a K-7 and a K-x. After doing A LOT of research I pretty much came to the realization that in the digital SLR photography world there are two big players, Canon and Nikon. After discussing my choices with my friends, one mentioned that his roommate had a K20 and loved it! I started to research Pentax, and discovered the incredible value to cost that you get from Pentax! I was sold on the K-x, then I started thinking I would like to have the benefits of amazing features and the weather seals. I live in Colorado and who knows when the weather will change. Also the stainless steel chassis and magnesium alloy body were a big sell. This K7 feels like you could use it as a hammer!! It doesn't feel like a feather-light toy, as some competitors do. (Same with the 2 WR lenses) Plus the feature list of the K-7 is amazing.I received it earlier than the promised date. It was packed fairly well and the package came in good condition. I took it out and set it to P and shot auto for the first day with the 18-55mm WR lens. I took some awesome shots on a \"nature walk\" through my neighborhood. I have moved onto the manual mode and have started to get into all the features to this camera. (There are so many!!) Having it for 4 days now, I have shot almost 1400 shots. Both indoor and outdoor. I have taken 30 second time delayed night shots, cloudy, full sun, indoor no flash, with flash. The high ISO noise that I have read people complaining about on forums is minimal if you have the settings right! I already have a \"highlight reel\" folder with my best shots.I decided to go with Pentax because they are headquartered in Colo. Also I like the fact that I can go buy used lenses and use them in manual focus. A beginner can use this camera and get good results.

One thing you must know is Pentax is one of the very few companies who make in-body stabilized DSLR's and used the same mount since film, allowing all current 3rd party lenses and manual lenses from 30 years ago to work on this body and still maintain optical stabilization. Huge advantage for Pentax over it's competitors, but sadly the world is brainwashed by what they see in Best Buy and the advertisements.Pentax builds cameras for photographers and hobbyists at the best of their ability. Pentax does not create 3 DSLRs in the same class, pricing them one over another after stripping features. Pentax are a loyal company to their loyal consumers; you will never see them screw their consumers over by producing a bunch of half-baked bodies and advertise them as everything. They make one DSLR for entry-level and one DSLR for semi-pro and putting all they have to offer for a more than reasonable price.Aside from the quality of Pentax's craftsmanship throughout the years, the superb build quality of the K-7 is not to be forgotten, that over 50 years of producing some of the finest film SLR's and DSLR's, all of that innovation and time spent have been put into creating this masterpiece. 77 weather-seals making it resistant to dust, rain, and cold temperatures, this is truly the most powerful Pentax ever built to date.Sometimes the best just don't get talked about, in fact most of the best things in life don't get talked about. Most people can't think for themselves. Out of all the people in the world, only a very select few who knows what's best for themselves. People don't come to realize the best things in life until it's too late. I'm glad to be part of the few who figured it out for myself. I do things in life that's best for me, not what others think is best for me. I go Pentax when others say otherwise, because when I held a Pentax in my hands for the very first time, I knew that was it.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "very, very pleased", "Author": "T. Sawyer", "ReviewID": "R35U7AUSMNL53R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After years of keen 35mm SLR photography I had retired my old Pentax kit and settled for compact digital photography, waiting for the \"right\" DSLR camera to come along. After seeing reviews of the K7 it seemed the ideal camera with the right spec and that would allow me to use my older Pentax glass so I took the plunge and ordered one along with the DA 18-55 lens.First impressions were good, nice and neat in the hand (other DSLRs will feel bulky), feels expensive, buttons well laid out and menus clear and a nice shutter sound. Its first assignment was on the continental divide in CO in mid Feb and it performed flawlessly in snow and temperatures significantly lower that the camera's quoted -15C. The 5.2 fps worked really well for action sequences and the images came out crisp and clear. Since then it has been used for more ordinary photography and has continued to impress; my wife is an artist and she has been using it for her work and loves it.So, in short, it has been an excellent purchase that I am very happy with indeed. The camera compares very favourably in operation and performance to Canon and Nikon cameras that I have encountered, is better looking and has less \"pose factor\" than those brands (which I like).Image quality is excellent with clear vibrant colours, operation smooth and easy to use with an excellent array of useful modes and features, weatherproofing effective. The low ISO performance which seems to be a criticism in reviews has not been an issue for me at all as I don't do that much of it, but results have been good for me even in low light. The kit lens is an ideal out and about lens and weatherproof, but don't expect it to be amazing optically as it is pretty cheap but it gets decent results and there is a huge choice in new and old Pentax lenses for all requirements. Video performance is also good and it's a welcome feature - I use it more that I thought I would.All in all, delighted and fully recommend.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "M. Emerson", "ReviewID": "R3RXGGP69DZU5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about 4 wks ago. I spent several months researching before buying. I also looked at the Nikon D90 and Olympus E-30. I decided on the Pentax K7 largely due better build quality, selection of good & reasonably priced prime lens (some of which I hope to pick up in 2010), and attractive pricing. I do a lot of backpacking; so the weather resistent build quality and ability to match small & good primes is a great combination. The 18-55 came with the kit, and I picked up the 50-200 WR zoom too. I have been very happy with the shots I've taken over the last few weeks. The jpegs are sharp with very good color. The video performace of the camera is very good too.Update 10/18/11: after owning this camera for a couple of years I can confirm this was a great purchase. Since buying the K7 2 yrs ago, I've bought the Pentax 40 and 21mm prime lens. These lens with the K7 make the perfect travel kit. The quality of the images produced by these lens is superb. Lastly, this camera has a lot of capabilities. I was able to take pictures from day 1 due the green mode etc. That said, throughout the months I've had this camera I keep learning new things which have made me a better photographer. Put different, with this camera I've grown from novice to an advanced intermediate photographer. Thanks Pentax!", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "So far so good...", "Author": "P. Seth", "ReviewID": "R2RX0X8P0OMR1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After much research, mostly tending towards nikons and canons, I came across this one. Caught my attention immediately with the metal body, 100% view finder, weather seal, compact size, in body shake reduction (which works nicely). An insignificant detail I like is the omission of scene modes from the settings dial. Already a little biased towards Pentax having used a spotmatic for many years, this is the camera I ended up with. My first D-SLR.  Have to say, I'm not disappointed. Its fast, responsive and fairly easy to use. Feels great in the hand though the N90 might be a shade more comfortable. K7 captures high quality images, good colors, sharpness etc. Would expect that from any high end camera. Continuous shooting hangs after 4-5 shots for memory transfer, maybe I need to use a faster card (using 4gb, class 4).K7 gets criticism for noisy high ISO output, but this doesn't really bother me - if I'm taking pictures at a party or indoor (not professionally), 14 mp of noisy image is enough to down sample for flickr/facebook etc. or regular size prints. Besides, the noise at 3400 ISO is not objectionable. Anyone recall 400 speed film!One disappointment is a limited selection of pentax lenses, e.g. I'd like an equivalent of canon's 24-70mm 2.8 L. Would be nice to have an option for the $99 50mm 1.8 prime (nikon?) vs. the $350 1.4 aperture. Happy with the 18-55 and 50-200 weather seal ones for now....Update (1/2)- discovered a bad pixel on the sensor after downloading images to computer. Little disappointed. Decided to return the camera instead of dealing with customer service. Amazon was great about this... Not to say good or bad about pentax customer service, just didn't want to deal with them a week after purchasing a product... All the same, excellent camera... miss it already.

I had originally been looking solely at Nikons, then spread my research to Canon.  One day I stumbled upon an ad for the Pentax K7.  I was familiar with the Pentax name, but knew nothing of their DSLRs.  Curious, I did my research.  Lots and lots of research.  It was overwhelming to sift through the many cameras out there and all of the tech. specs., which, at this point, I am not all familiar with.  I read many reviews and decided to order the K7 as a first DSLR for my college courses.  I'm very pleased that I happened to see an ad for it and went for the camera.It's been a great camera to learn on and get reaquainted with manual photography with (I had only used an old SLR prior to this.  So far, the image quality seems great (if the camera is set correctly (ISO)).  I've had quite a few learning experiences with this camera.  Now that I know more of what I'm doing, my photos are certainly turning out better and they print very well.I really enjoy the electronic level function and the many ways you can customize the settings on the camera.  I read some reviews about the menu settings being a bit archaic, but I think they suit the camera quite well.  Not having to scroll down through one or two large menus is really nice.One of the selling points on this camera for me was the weatherized body.  I've put it to the test, and it certainly has not let me down yet.  I've had this little bugger out in the snow, pretty much since I de-boxed it.  It's gone on quite a few adventures, accompanying me across wind-whipped lakes on the ice and even down a hill whilt tubing.  I may have also accidentally dropped my camera bag with the camera in it.  No damage!  (I have the Medium Size Ape Case Pro by Norazza, a great bag to go along with the camera and a lens or two).If I had to be incredibly picky about something, it would have to be the lens cap that came with the lens.  Try as I might, I can never seem to get it to actually lock on.  Sometimes it seems as if it is on, but then it will slip off.  It kind of makes me think it could scratch the lens, pretty much defeating the purpose of a cap.  Pretty insignificant, but hey, that just goes to show what a great DSLR this is.  I may end up tossing the cap all together and going for filter instead, but I'm not sure yet.All in all, I've really been pleased with my K7's performance.  I'm excited to go through photography classes with it, even if I am the only one with a Pentax.  As they say, be different!

I always leaned towards Cannon or Nikkon but the Pentax just seemed to be a real camera and not all hype.  I also really liked the weather resistant rating on this camera.  My first impressions is that this camera is great, has a lot of features and I love the quality of pics and the quality of the feel of the camera base.I've only had it for about 2 weeks, and I bought the Magic Lantern book with it which I also recommend if your new to DSLRs.  I have taken about 500 pics so far and I'm very very impressed witht the prints and the speed of the camera.  I took it on a recent hiking trip in Sedona, Az and got hit hard by wind/sand ontop of a ridge and was happy to have such a weather resistant camera.  I took a total of 200 photos and all the pics came crisp and clean.  The only problem was that I bought a cheap 55mm UV filter which I don't recommend.  I got a few pics of flare towards the west photos during sunset.  So I just ordered a B+W high quality filter which I should get in the mail soon.  Don't waste your money on a cheap filter!I also like the software that came with the K-7. It's not as good as photoshop, but it's easy to use and you can make good touch ups when it comes to WB and Ev really quick.All in all, I'm a new DSLR user and I'm still learning how to master the camera and digital photography in general.

Having Nikons for the last 30 years, the K7 compares very well to a Nikon d300s.  It does not have quite as high of a sustained high-speed shooting capacity, but K7's 5 fps is just fine for my purposes.I like having the shake reduction in-body rather than in-lens.  I also picked up the Pentax FA35 2.0 for low-light situations.  Any lens becomes a shake reduction lens with shake reduction in the body.Speaking of low-light situation, several have pointed out that Pentax chooses to do less noise reduction at high ISO levels.  It is actually selectable on the K7.  If anyone is serious about low-light photography, as I am, then you want to shoot in raw mode, and do noise-reduction in post-processing.  In that mode you will find the K7 to produce the same results as the D300s.In addition to the excellent build quality, one thing I really like about the K7 is its size, weight, and feel.  Very lean, nice to carry and use.Jan 10:  Sorry, I need to revise this review. I recommend against buying the K7 based on the recent rebate issues. Pentax revised the K7 packaging sometime in late November or early December. Many, perhaps all, retailers now have the new packaging. The SKU on the new packaging is not listed on the rebate form, so the rebate requests are being rejected. If you call Pentax they direct you back to their third party rebate fulfillement center.

After building myself a few, one for my wife and another for a friend I decided to build the pc of all pc's. I ended up with a new Intel Core I7 (1366 platform) 920. The default speed of that processor is 2.67 GHz.Taking all the knowledge I aquired in previous builds, I added the most proficient air cooler to the chip, replaced all the fans in my Cooler Master HAF 932 case for maximum air flow to keep the unit cool, then I overclocked that CPU to 4.2 GHz. Then putting in two powerful video cards and 6 gigabytes of the fastest RAM on the market ( 2000MHz ), and running stress test after stress test finally reaching a top speed of 4.357GHz I could get no more performance out of the build. I tuned it back down to 4.2 GHz to run 24/7 and came to the realization I was bored. :) That being the case I had to find a new hobby that would preferably utilize all the power I had built into my new PC. Having sold my old Minolta X700 and it's lenses a few months earlier, hating my point and shoot camera, I decided to re-teach myself photography in the digital format. Back to researching and reading all I could to make an informed purchase, I came across the Pentax K7. This unit having more features than I ever came across shooting film, falling in to a price range I found affordable and being several hundred dollars cheaper with comparable features in a Canon or a Nikon I felt this would be a good price to performance buy and I went for it, and I am so glad I did. This little wonder is going to take me years to master. With so many shooting formats as well as hi-def movie capability, coupled up with my new PC and some nice software to work with my shots, I don't anticipate beig bored again for a very long time. It was a Christmas present to myself and I've probably taken 1500 to 2000 pictures so far trying to learn what some of the things built into it do. What an impressive little tool this camera is. It's not a camera, it's a tool. I'm getting somewhat proficient at composing and choosing the correct exposure settings for the few formats I've chosen, I am REALLY having fun with this piece of equipment. I am at the infant stage in this new hobby as I not only have to digest all the things the camera can do, I have some complex software I need to learn as well. I don't think I'll ever make it as a professional photographer, although I'm pretty impressed with the photos this Pentax has produced I suppose one could become a pro with this camera.Dollar for dollar, feature for feature, this new Pentax K7 is one exceptional buy.If you are not a pro and are looking for a great digital SLR to graduate to from a point and shoot and maybe having used a film SLR in your past, you should really take a good hard look at this Pentax. If I had to bracket this unit in a class I would say it's definately an enthusiasts camera bordering on the professional with all the features it comes with. Before you lay down thousands on a Canon or a Nikon having all the features included in the K7 I would recomend you take a good hard look at this camera and all the technology built in to it.

Working in the construction industry I was looking for a camera that would last in demanding conditions, Pentax seems like a good choice, I had the waterproof point in shoot that was a few years old it is was a workhorse but it was time to upgrade to something better. About a year after purchasing the camera while out on the jobsite I dropped the camera on the dirt it bounced down into a trench that was 10 feet deep. I had my guys hand it up to me, the lens was tweaked but other that that and some dirt it was still in once piece. I took the lens off and snapped it back together and turned the camera on and somehow it still works.

Chow", "ReviewID": "R1QCWTVJ4K6HT1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I struggled for a long time before getting this camera over the Nikon D90. The primary reason is that this camera for me is \"free\" - from awards points. But when I received the camera in mail, I was complete surprised by how well this camera was constructed. Compare with Nikon D90, this fells SOLID! As for the weather resistance feature, I was very surprised as well. That, also, was so thoughtful and well constructed. When I hold this camera, it gives me a sense of quality. I am quite satisfied with the engineering and build aspect of it. As for the image quality, it is better, IMHO, to the D90. Then again, these two are not in the same class. The K7 is more inline with Nikon D300 instead but with the price-tag of a D90. As for the software (menu and such), I find that to be OK. It is something that I'll have to get used to, as with any other cameras. After using it for 4 months, I think I am finally getting a hang of this. I am still OK with the kit lens (18-55mm F/3.5-5.6) and may get a prime lens (fixed 50mm F/1.4) later. Don't know if I'll ever bother to get a 18-200mm F/3.5-6.3, but will have to see. In all, I am really satisfied with this camera and hope to be getting more lens for it in the future.

Lots of positives: The weather resistant body is rugged and feels solid in your hands, and is noticeably more compact than other digital SLRs.  Despite the smaller size (which comes in handy when traveling or hiking), the whole camera feels much more substantial than the Nikon and Canon models in the same price range that I test drove.  Good low-light sensitivity and shake reduction work together with great auto white balance to let me capture great interior shots with ambient light (or sometimes a flash with a diffuser bounced off the ceiling if it's really dark).  Controls are laid out well and are intuitive to use, and it's a piece of cake to adjust f stop, exposure times and compensation settings while you're shooting.  Daylight shooting is a breeze.  Autofocus motor in the body and shake reduction built in to the body mean that lenses are cheaper.  Having HD video capability at the ready has been awesome while traveling. Quite often I take it with just the 18-55 mm zoom lens, and leave all my other gear in the camera bag at home.Negatives:  Autofocus sometimes searches for a moment in very low light, but does usually find focus after a second or two.  The frame rate in burst mode shooting is decent, but not super fast.  Pentax cameras and lenses are not as common as the Canon & Nikon, but with the body and two decent zooms, and possibly a hot shoe flash, you'd be all set.  If you need to shoot at really high frame rates, capture 1000's of images per day, or need super high performance lenses and other gear, this may not be the camera for you.

And no, I'm not exactly a pro, but I do shoot a lot for both work and vaction, so bottom line is: I LOVE IT! I just get so inspired, I haven't felt like that since I had to retire my old 35mm Pentax. I did choose Pentax because I do have a 30 year old XL and a bunch of manual lenses that I really didn't want to throw away. They work perfectly with the K7, however the obvious fact is that the manual lenses won't turn magically into automatic, and the camera must be programed for them to work, but I am very happy 'cause they DO work.Here's some other features I love: super fast trigger (not easily clogged), tons of customizable settings, on-screen warnings, and it is quite small and light for a DSLR... Having said that, It is NOT an easy camera to use for someone with even a little photographic training, and most of the menus are designed for studio-type pics, or if you'd have enough time before taking the pic which cannot be all of the time, so if anything I'd improve on, is somehow having an on-the-fly type options, better superdark sensitivity, and better remote control sensitivity.

I used Pentax DSLRs for years, first k10, later k20 and now I have been trying K7. Sorry to say, but I'm going to return the camera for a refund. It feels awesome in hand (just like all Pentax bodies I used) it has an edge in advanced features, unfortunately, for my taste it is severely lacking in image quality. The image simply isn't sharp, even after calibration it is not. The kit lens, while feels TERRIFIC, with nice resistance, nothing sloppy about it, they can't get the job done. I never had issues with Pentax kit lens before in my life!The image isn't clean enough. I  can see a junk in JPG images in dark areas even on ISO100. The noise coupled with out of focus images as you can imagine, doesn't translate into quality pictures. To say, the AF speed is SUPER FAST, it is as fast, in fact, as once \"world fastest AF\" Minolta Maxxum 7 was, that is very fast. May be the lens in my kit is defective, but overall it doesn't make a good impression. I really wanted to love it, but I can't stand the IQ. To correct the situation I would need much more expensive (and much heavier) lens, and I find myself in completely different ballpark, in over $1.5k area, where are so many compelling choices (with much greater choice of better and inexpensive zoom lenses).I don't want stepping into discussion of Pentax details preservation vs. Canon destructive noise reduction, but all things considered, and while the RAW images are equally good, Canon has WAY better Jpeg techniques and its out of camera jpegs are superior to these of Pentax.Another issue is the resin Pentax uses on the handle. First it is not very well clued, I feel like it moves under my fingers, and second, it attracts the dust like magnet! In fact the micropores in the resin on a grip and back (thumb), absorbs the dust and I can't get it out of there even with washing and brushing! It is very poor choice of material. It is very annoying to have a dust in resin pores on a grip!In short, while made of magnesium allow, nicely sculpted, having cool features, etc, it is not up to a claim in image quality, and I can tell its Malaysian assembly quality is FAR FAR AWAY from real Japanese quality of assembly by similarly priced Canon and Nikon.I really can't care less for its movie modes, but why two of three of its modes, having some lunacy resolution? WHY? It makes it completely useless as you can't combine the footage with other sources in a timeline! If one has a pile of Pentax equipment accumulated during the years, it makes sense to get the camera. Why anybody else would bother, I can't tell.Well, I do have some Pentax equipment, some flashes, few lenses etc.all of which are going for sale.
