I bought one several months ago and put it under the eaves on the outside of the house.  It still works great.  I bought this one for a customer on mine and it works great.  It moves up and down, left and right and will focus.  This is a great buy.  It has a good clear picture.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb for the money", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R1KLMUUTOFNSRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Using it in a restaurant for indoor security.

All the others have about the same features but you need to buy an extra this or extra that and this one even comes with the screwdriver to hookup the P&T; wires!  :>It is about the size of a roll of toilet paper so its a little larger than some I have looked at but overall I really am glad I bought this.  I can't speak on longevity yet but if given enough light, like most security cameras, it has a nice enough picture.Maybe its just my DVR but the P&T; speed can be adjusted and on high it is really fast you almost can't stop it where you want, about 3/4 speed it is perfect for what I like.  I have 7 locations preset and it zips right thru them.The field of view is a little narrow for a small room but the night vision is very good.Overall I bought this for about $100 and am very pleased.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "PTZ Great", "Author": "blurb", "ReviewID": "R3W02QETHBS5R6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works just fine, would love for them to come up with zoom.or maybe 2.2 mm wide lense, for indoors..Maybe even a outside version of this 6mm..Still works Good..", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "50-50 on cameras", "Author": "Shootnjohn", "ReviewID": "R30K1H1OF4SED8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought two of these to replace some bullet cameras, to give a little better video coverage.  The one I put on the front porch works just fine.  The one in the back of the house would go on its own - traveling around looking at things.  Not sure why, I ended up just disconnecting the motor power.  Picture quality on both cameras is very good.  WARNING- Do not spray wasp spray on these cameras. Find some other way to get rid of wasps. Gonna have to buy a new one, not covered under warranty.  Got good help from tech support when initially installing these cameras too.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "PT Camera", "Author": "no-pen-name-foolishness", "ReviewID": "RXSOQ5TL6S0EJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Cameras was larger than I had expected - about 6\" high and about 4\" in diameter.  My ethernet Panasonic PT camera is about 1/4th the size.The mechanics of the unit worked smothly.  I could control the camera with a remote tablet through it's pan/Tilt movements.I was not impressed with the image quality.  This is a subjective opinion and that could just be me.  For the cost, the camera is a good unit.*** One other Odd thing: Every since I ordered this unit, I have been hit by Security Telemarketing.  Calls from all over the country selling security systems.  I don't know if there is a relationship, but I never received them before.  Some of them say that I was recommended by a friend - I don't think so!", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is ok.....", "Author": "DCA", "ReviewID": "R22CZ6OB9IQUMX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is not a upper end camera, for the price what do you think you will get?
