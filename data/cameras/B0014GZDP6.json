{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cheaply Made", "Author": "FLRON \"BigRon\"", "ReviewID": "R23W8ZDAJFYI2G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought two signs, one for the front and one for the rear of my home. The biggest complaint I have is the cheap, plastic, stake used to hold the up the signs. They are way too short. When you push it into the ground, the sign (also plastic) is so low, no one would see it. I had to tape the sign to my rear storm door window so it could be readily seen. That looked tacky. I had to place the front sign in a flower box to be seen. That one keeps getting blown over when it is windy. My old sign (now broken after 20 years, from storm damage) from a previous security company had a strong, metal stake about four feet long. The Swann sign also came with stickers for windows and doors. They were written in English and Spanish. I thought the Spanish language stickers was a bit too much, inferring that Hispanics might try to break in my home. The yard sign itself was also bi-lingual. It is a matter of getting what you pay for. They were cheap in price and unfortunateluy, cheap in value. You may be beter off getting security signs from a box store where you can see them before you buy.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fair to Middling", "Author": "W.
