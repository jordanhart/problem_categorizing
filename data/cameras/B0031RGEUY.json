{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Its tough but its not great *Updated March 7, 2011", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3EQRHGVTV5GGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned many Olympus cameras in the past but this is my first camera I have purchased from their \"tough\" line.  As advertised this thing looks and feels very sturdy.  The seals on it look like they will hold out any kind of moisture and dust and the lens has its own protective shroud and cover to protect it from scratches or damage.  The lens also does not extend or retract so dust, sand, and dirt cant jam it up (which is a problem I have had before).  It also has a minimum of buttons to break or stick and it has a very soild body construction.  So on a toughness scale of 1-10 the Stylus tough 8010 gets an 11.  This camera really is in a class of its own on when it comes to durablity, and it is the only camera I have seen my colleagues take with them into combat zones.On the other hand it looks like Olympus tried to cram all the wrong things into this rugged camera.  The first thing you will notice when operating this camera is how slow it is between pictures, even with a class 6 SD card in it, its write speed seems painfully slow.  Don't get me wrong I am very happy Olympus finally got ride of the XD card but it doesnt seem like they've fixed their write speed problems.  Picture quality also isnt that great but thats not a major hit given the small lens they are working with.One thing you find on the camera that shouldn't be there is all kinds of picture editing or \"Beauty\" features in the camera.  This software does an okay job but take way to long to proccess.  In my opinion Olympus should leave photo editing to photo editing software on a computer and instead focus on making this camera take better pictures with less lag time between shots.Over all this camera is great if you plan on going to a very rough part of the world, or even swimming with it.  But if your just an average person looking for a camera to take good pictures this is not for you.  Instead buy a cheaper camera with a better lens and get a good camera case to protect it from everyday life.**Update - I had to send this camera in for warranty repair because it stopped reading my SD card, I also complained about the long delay between shots.  Olympus repair gets 5 stars.  They replaced the cameras circuit board and updated the camera with the latest firm ware and had it sent via 2 day UPS shipping in the same day they received it.The camera is faster now; it went from a 3 second delay to about a 2 second delay between shots and it's more responsive when scrolling through the menu.  I will take a 33% increase in speed, it's still not great but then again this is a \"rugged camera\" so you have to chose your battles.I bought this camera when it very first came out which I am sure is why it had old firmware on it.  Olympus should put this firmware update on their website so everyone can have it without having to send their camera in, but I would say that it would be worth it to send your camera in if you are as frustrated as I was with the delay that this camera has.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Completely Disappointed with Functionality", "Author": "S. ZoBell", "ReviewID": "R38XJ2KF4MKQD8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not assume that I am biased or jaded, my score is based upon real-world usage of this camera.  I own the Olympus Stylus 1030SW and have been very happy with its performance as a all-around point-and-shoot as well as an underwater camera, so I was thrilled to see the 8010 come out as the upgrade with higher resolution, better zoom and deeper capabilities.  I pre-ordered the 8010 and it arrived just days before we left on our cruise which enabled me to do some real-world validation.  I was sorely wishing I had brought my 1030SW as I was trying to capture images on the trip.The Good:The overall exterior design is great on the 8010.  I really liked the new double-lock on the battery / memory compartment.  Kudos for moving to the standard SD format as well.  The new 720 video resolution is nice as well.  It still feels like it drops a frame or two every so often at 720, but it is very good quality for the optics.  The camera performs well underwater with good vibrant images.The Bad:The software running this camera is the complete downfall.  The menu and selections are very sluggish, going from option to option you have to deliberately think 'go slow' or you will find yourself very frustrated.  I am not sure what Olympus did with the white-balance of this camera but its functionality lies somewhere between 'completely broken' and 'completely frustrated'.  I could take several pictures of individuals on the beach and one image would be completely blown out like a whiteout and the next image would look like it was a completely dark overcast day.  I tried several times to change the settings to compensate for this, and I found that if I angled the camera around enough I could almost get the picture I wanted.  The trouble was that for nearly every shot I was taking a picture, then tweaking the settings several times and have to adjust where I am pointing to try and get the image to come out partially descent.  I have never had to manipulate a camera so much - EVER.  All the while my daughter standing next to me would snap the same shot with her $95 Nikon and it would look great.  It also appears that the flash is much less powerful, typically when the individual in the image is too dark, with a lighter background, I would change the settings to force the flash, but with this camera it hardly made a dent.  Also on several of the videos take at the beach it was almost as though the sensor was overloaded as I would get a bright white / pink streak on the video as we were shooting on a bright day.When I returned from my trip, I saw the great reviews here on Amazon and figured i must have bought a defective one so I called Olympus.  I received no satisfaction from them, so I ultimately returned it to Amazon.  I then purchased a 2nd one to see if truly my original was defective and found the exact same results and as such I have returned the 2nd camera as well.  Thank goodness for Amazon's fantastic return policy.  I am now using my 1030SW and looking to see what is the real solution for the next upgrade from that camera.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great easy to use sturdy camera!", "Author": "Leslie

I love swimming off the island - dive boats park nearby. This was also the trial run for my Olympus Tough-8010 camera and since I watched YouTube videos before deciding to purchase it, I thought it was important to post a video, mentioning how satisfied I am with the camera. Natural lighting and conditions had the most significant impacts on pictures - pretty much, what I saw, is what I got in video and still photos. The underwater scene selection was a time saver as is the handy 1 click video button. The only problem I had was probably unavoidable - underwater I could not see the picture preview at all - not enough light, I suppose -so I was forced to point and hope that I was taking the picture as intended. Very satisfied with the camera overall!!!", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Rugged Camera for Inhospitable Environments", "Author": "Scotty", "ReviewID": "R2QGXCFPRRQISC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Olympus Stylus Tough 8010 digital camera withstands inhospitable environments while taking very good pictures. The heavy-duty housing is well-sealed from the elements, with the battery compartment and usb and hdmi connections sealed by an o-ring protected double-locked door.Initial camera set-up is VERY simple. After inserting and partly charging the battery (via the camera USB connection), camera initialization can be performed from the attached computer. Image-processing software can also be installed from the camera itself. The software is basic, but does have a couple of Olympus-specific touches.Out of the box, users must charge the replaceable battery via the usb connection while the battery is in the camera; via a computer or the provided wall charger. In order to continue shooting, I've since purchased an external charger and extra battery so that I can swap batteries and continue shooting while recharging the depleted cell. Each is readily available from online vendors; both Olympus original and facsimiles.The camera has numerous scene modes, face recognition, and effective anti-shake technology. The panorama mode is nice, but slow to stitch pictures together and is not entirely accurate.Shot delay from the time that the shutter is pressed sometimes causes a moment to be missed. Save times for 14 mb images to a SDHC card are a bit lengthy.The non-standard mini-usb connection at the camera end is less-than-secure, causing occasional connect-disconnect cycling.Overall, I find this camera relatively easy to use; though it can be confusing to a digital photography newcomer. The camera can be set to a fully-automatic mode for those folks. I've not yet explored all of the scene modes, but the three tried thus far aid in obtaining sharp pictures.For someone who wants a capable camera that can be used at the beach or in the pool; this is the best I've found. For those who don't need weather or environment resistance, other choices at approximately half the price will fill the bill nicely.\"", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "So so...", "Author": "T.

All in all it acts like an amazing 2.5 MP camera. The 14MP is too much for the lens I guess. Try and zoom in on a pic during editing and it's grainy. Olympus offered to inspect my brand new camera at a repair facility, but given other online reviews, I think this camera just takes mediocre pics.It's worth about $200 to me, but I paid twice that, so I'm disapoonted and annoyed.

When writing \"How To Take Stunning Underwater Photos Using Point And Shoot Cameras\" (Kindle, Nook, Lulu and Apple) we tested and tried every POS underwater camera we could find and the Tough 8010 was the clear winner for price, quality, and ruggedness. I am about to buy another. This will be my forth in three years. Not bad when you consider we are in the water most every day and the cameras get tossed around without much care. (I work as a yacht captain) The cameras are all still working, but get a little tired after about a year of abuse.The only drawback seems to be the LONG reset time between photos. Still check out the video we are posting. Pretty good stuff for a POS pocket camera.One more thought is we have had dozens of underwater photos published taken with the Olympus Tough. That is pretty good when you consider most published photos were taken with expensive, SLR underwater cameras.Hope that helps other choose.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Watch this camera in salt water", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R306S178RHBEE5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I originally purchased the lesser of the Olympus Stylus Tough and had to return it because of \"water damage\".

Each and EVERY camera had roughly 10% to 20% of negative reviews.  I visited different stores to hold the cameras in my hands and to see how sturdy they each felt.After 4 weeks of intense review, I decided upon this camera for the following reasons:1) 5X optical zoom2) Cool color blue3) Sturdy and solid as a rock4) Price is highly competitive5) One touch video recording6) The buttons are very EZ to use...even under waterWe took this camera to Punta Cana in the Caribbean.  I used it in the kids water park, in the large adult pools, in the ocean, on a deserted island, while snorkeling, and while scuba diving.  This camera met each and every challenge with no problems whatsoever!  I even banged it against the side of the pool two or three times by accident and it just keeps on working.  It's EXCELLENT.  It's rated for a depth of 16.5 feet, but I took it 20 feet under during a 40 minute dive and had zero problems!  I never had to use the manual because the camera has a help button that provides more details for every menu option.The camera is easy to use for still photos and video.  In terms of battery usage, it does very well when shooting still photos with the flash on.  For some reason it seems to consume the battery pretty quickly when shooting video....but that doesn't matter because you can pick up an extra battery for very little money on Amazon.  The video files are saved in the MP4 file format....which is GREAT because it takes up less space than AVI files !!!  Check out the pictures I uploaded!I had zero problems with the camera focusing.  It's awesome!UPDATE: November 2011 (2 months since my original review).  I purchased the camera in August and took it on vacation (as mentioned above).  The camera was awesome on the trip and still works just fine.  I have zero regrets and will continue to take this camera on vacations/trips etc.  After using it for 3 months, I think it's AWESOME for underwater stills and video.  I most recently took this camera to the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon - it was such a great feeling to use it for video rather than bringing along a separate camcorder!  My only \"concern\" is that when I shoot pics of my kids at school (indoors), the photos come out just \"average\".  I'm not sure if it's me, or the flash isn't strong enough, or maybe I need to read the manual, but some photos come out a little dark, and sometimes a bit blurry.

My son took that one to Vietnam with him, so I got this one to replace it. The 720 had always taken really good pictures for me, and I'd drug it through rainstorms, sub-zero backcountry ski trips, and hauled it in my sweat-soaked cycling jersey across Kansas and Colorado in July, all with no ill effects to the camera. This experience led me to want to get the next generation. Some of the reviews I read made me a little cautious, as there seemed to be some folks with picture quality issues.My experience to date is that this camera is easier to use than the 720, (and I considered the 720 easy to use), and the picture quality is every bit as good as the 720. I'm not a professional, and I'm sure that this sort of camera doesn't take images that can compare to a high-end SLR. However, it seems to me that once you step into the point and shoot world, this camera is as good as any in terms of the images it captures. Like any of these cameras, the \"magic and presets\" that they build in make it very easy to take bad pictures if you aren't careful. For example, if you tell the camera you're taking indoor pictures with flo lights, then try taking outdoor pictures in the sun, you're not going to like the images. However, if you learn how to keep the auto settings at the right place, the pictures seem to be excellent.Regarding ease of use, I really like the layout of the menu, and have come to the point where I can easily make changes to the settings I normally mess with. I do think that the manufactures of these devices should spend more time with people to learn the way people really use cameras, and set up the flow of menus in a way that's better suited to most users. That said, this camera is better than many I've played with, but then again, maybe they're all improving.The one thing I don't like is the weight - this feels about 50% heavier than the 720. If you're designing a device for rugged use, a good assumption is that weight is an important factor to that user. Figure our a way to reduce weight.Have taken a couple thousand images so far - will update again after using it for a year.UPDATE: I've used the camera for over a year now. I retract what I earlier said about image quality - it's not as good as the 720, and certainly not as good as many other cameras I've used. Both the sharpness of the image and the color \"mixing\" leave something to be desired. I've messed with forcing a lower ISO and everything else I can think of, but have concluded that the quality of the \"picture-taking\" ability is simply not there.On top of that, after only 4 months, the camera gave me fits on a long cycling trip. I bought a cheap replacement until I could get home and get this one repaired. The cheap replacement took better images. After getting it home, I had to ship the camera to Olympus for repairs, which took many weeks, and now the camera has begun acting up again. While I initially gave this 4 stars, I have to say that after using it for a year, I'm dropping that rating to 2 stars. It would be one star, but it is still rugged - just takes poor images and seems prone to break.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bit disappointed", "Author": "Gadgety Refudiate", "ReviewID": "RRB2EKZALMKDI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a long time Olympus fan and owner of a Olympus DSLR.

The shutter speed is fine, unless you are trying to take pictures of Hummingbirds on cocaine or something. The 'burst shot' or 'progressive shot' option is great for parents. There ARE SLIGHTLY better tough cams on the market right now, but the price difference is STAGGERING for a few more megapixels (and lets be honest again, this is an everyday use point and shoot... NOT a DSLR. I DOUBT you are using this for professional photography). You HAVE to read the directions to maintain waterproofing, very important or you can damage your components. Also, I have read things about mediocre battery life on here and it not coming with a wall charger. You can buy the battery hub charger from Olympus, NEVER use generic (they pose the risk of exploding). The best way to maintain battery life is to NEVER take out your battery with bare hands! The oils from your hands can make your battery overheat and expand and over time you lose battery life. The only thing I can say to get the best shots is to NOT rely on you camera to take the best photos in Auto. You need to play around with it for a few hours and see what kind of settings get you what type of results. I use the \"pet\" setting with burst shot on my son, and it takes better photos then the portrait setting because he moves so much. Overall it is easy to use (for me) Just buy it, honestly it's only $150", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Has many good qualities", "Author": "V. jung", "ReviewID": "R3SP4ZWT2WSYF0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had an older Olympus that I loved but it broke (because my daughter had it in the rain) and Olympus does not fix it anymore but offered a trade-in deal.  I chose this because it is supposed to be waterproof and drop-proof.  I have used it on four or five occasions so far. But I have not deeply tested it.Pros:My kids and their friends put it in a soda glass to test it and it came out unscathed.  It hooks up seamlessly to the TV so we can immediately watch the movies and photos on TV- It has RCA and USB.  The panorama setting is cool and looks great.  The HD video looks good.  Nice internal memory. Settings are fairly easy to use.  Size and weight are good.  Zoom works well. Buttons are straight forward. Video recording is easy.Cons:I find it has a long lag time between pics in the regular setting.  The video sound quality is pretty bad.  It has some hum sometimes- and does not capture spoken sounds well.  Ambient is OK. I had a sandisc memory card in the camera and when it filled up, the camera did not automatically go to its internal memory.  I had to take out the card when it was full.  I may not be finding the right settings for that.  The indoor light balance of the video was a little yellow on one occasion.Overall I think this is great for vacations and general use.  I am counting on it as the camera for my teens.

Secondly, the shutter lag (from the time you press the shutter button to the time you actually capture to picture) is over 1 second, which doesn't seem like much, but in reality, it translates into a lot of missed perfect moments.

It was made to be a rugged waterproof camera. This is the third camera I have tried of this type and I can say without a doubt this is the best one so far. I got a good price on it and would be more disappointed if I paid more, but for what I paid I think this camera is a great value.What this camera is... This camera is rugged and waterproof and therefore sacrifices need to be made. Yes the software in the camera is slow. Yes it can be somewhat slow in between photos. BUT It takes great photos especially when you are outdoors. Color reproduction is good and it does what I want it to which is take photos in, around or near water without worrying. No it is not perfect, but again compared to other rugged cameras it is by far the best I have used so far at this price point. This thing is built like a tank and if you read the reviews there are very few people that have had problems with water issues. Just remember to let the camera and your hands completely dry before you open this camera and you should be fine. You should be thinking hours for this process, not minutes.What this camera is NOT...This camera is not my DSLR that has very expensive lenses and allows me to take photos that can be blown up to very large sizes and take production ready photos. But I would never take my DSLR where I would take this camera. It also is not my wifes very nice little point and shoot camera that has a 1,000x zoom with great noise and camera software. However we have already replaced her camera once because it broke just from being in her purse. The DSLR and my wife's pocket cameras are the ones we pull out when we are home and traveling close by to a friend's house for example. This camera is the one you take with you to the pool, lake or go on a cruise with.What this camera excels at is it matches our active lifestyle. We enjoy taking the dog to the lake, we enjoy the beach, river, and any other body of water. I bought this specifically for a cruise we are going on. I wanted something I could throw in my shorts pocket and not worry about no matter what adventure we go on and this fits the bill.In closing if you DON'T need rugged then yes there are better point and shoots out there and you should look else where. And you would have to be crazy to compare this to a DSLR. All the negative reviews I just don't think understood what they were buying. Heck if someone can point me to a rugged little camera that is a better value then this at this price point then please let me know.

The only negative is that it is difficult to hold it so that part of your hand doesn't cover the lense, something I didn't realize until I looked at the photos later.  If you don't want to worry about this issue, consider obtaining one of those micro tripods that can double as a \"handle\" for the camera.  I found you do NOT need one of these to steady the shot, but it makes it so that your hand isn't actually trying to hold the camera and it elimnates the problem of covering the lense.  I found the user interface easy to use, HOWEVER your settings are not kept for the next time you turn on the camera. This makes it more difficult to take spontaneous shots, since you might have to pause to set your options prior to the shot.  This got a little annoying, but was workable.

I had the camera for over 3 years and unfortunately lost it in a taxi cab on a trip about 5 months ago.  I decided to replace it with the latest and greatest Olympus version.  I had praised my previous camera to everyone I knew.  However, here are the things that I have found about this latest 8010 version.1. First, a large percentage of the time, this camera will NOT focus.  You will point this camera at everything in the frame and continue to get the sad sound of no focus.  This is a very irritating point.2. Second you will have to wait approximately 1 to 2 seconds after you push the shutter release before it will take a picture.  If you are trying to \"catch\" a memory on film, then forget it.3. The battery life is atrocious and you can't replace the battery or buy an extra.  You charge the camera by plugging the whole camera in the wall.  However, I think I found the reason that the battery has no usable life span.  With the camera on auto, the flash, flashes, on every photo regardless of how much light you have available.  Test this by pointing the camera at a light fixture and take a picture or take it outside on a sunny day and take a picture and you will see that the flash fires.  It tries to use the lowest shutter speed possible but even with a shutter speed of 125 or 250, the flash still fires.  I personally believe that this is the primary reason for the lack of battery life.4. The image quality is not commiserate of a 14mp camera.  Many of my photos are washed out and not even usable whereas my older version had people gasping at how amazing they were!I sent the camera off to have it \"repaired\" with my full list of complaints only to have it returned with no documentation on what they found or what they fixed.  I took it out of the box and immediately found that the flash still fires on every photo.  Go figure.I bought this from Best buy and even though I have the reciept, I don't believe that I have any recourse.

However, I was expecting more from this camera.  I already own the Olympus 790 SW (7.1 MP with 3x zoom) but after 3 years was having some issues with the optics.  I decided to upgrade to the 8010 14MP camera with a 5x zoom.  I loved the waterproof feature of the 790 and the 8010 is rated to an even deeper 33 feet.  I was expecting the 8010 to have many improvements over the 790, but this is not true.When taking a photo there is about a 3 second delay before the image previews on the display.  My older, less expensive Olympus camera had the images come up immediately.  Even when I reduce the resolution from 14MP to 8MP the problem persists.  (I'm using a Sandisk 8GB class 6 HDSC card rated at 20MB/S) Some of the other down sides to this camera are:1. The camera does not come with an external battery charger.  You have to charge the battery in the camera.  This makes it impossible to charge a depleted  battery while still using the camera.  I opted to by the Olympus charger for an extra $30 bucks.2.  There is no manual that comes with the camera.  I have tried to download it from the official Olympus site with no avail.3.  The menus for the different scene selection modes are inferior to previous Olympus camera models.  Where the 790 had a photo for each different scene, the 8010 has a small icon with a brief  description for the scene.4.  The button to turn the camera on is not easy to press.  I suppose this is to inhibit the camera from being turned on by accident, but I never had that problem with the 790 which was much easier to turn on.5.  The camera is a bit heavier and bulkier than my previous model.On the plus side, the 8010 takes very nice underwater pictures and videos.  I've used it in the swimming pool several times.  I'm never afraid to get the camera wet at the pool or the beach.  This is the main reason that I purchased the 8010.  Although I've never dropped the camera, it does feel very sturdy.  And, the picture quality is really very nice.If you're looking for a camera that you can take in or near the water, the 8010 is a good bet.  You'll just have to get used to the slow response time for previewing the photos.  You can probably get used to the bad menus and the difficult on/off button, but if you want to charge a battery while still using the camera you'll have to spring for a new external charger (that used to be included).", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus Stylus Tough 8010", "Author": "David L.

The picture quality on this camera is horrible.  I have never had a camera that has given so many blurry images, especially indoors.  Unless you use the mode selector and use a very specific mode for each scenario, you get very poor quality photos.  The camera doesn't seem to be able to automatically adjust its settings in auto mode.The waterproof portion did work until one of the seals around the lens came off.  I'm not really sure when or how it came off, only that I recently noticed it wasn't there anymore.  Haven't looked into getting it repaired as I am not satisfied with the picture quality.  I am upgrading to the DSC TX-5 instead; it is getting really good reviews all around.In the camera's defense, when it does take a sharp photo, using the mode selector, the pictures are good.  Video is decent, but not over the top, in my opinion.  I am not a photo guru, so I don't know about all shutter speeds, saturation, etc.  I just see a picture and think it is either bad, good, or great.  These photos are good, when they are not blurry.  I would guess that about 40% of the photos I take are blurry.  If the lighting changes, even slightly, while in a scene select mode, the photos come out blurry.  If you can master the scene's mode you may like this camera.  I don't have the patience, I want something that auto detects quickly and accurately.  I have had good luck with other Sonya camera's, and I still wanted a waterproof camera, so I chose the TX-5 as this camera's replacement.I also am not a fan of XD cards, another reason for jumping off the Olympus bandwagon.

a camera that is waterproof and durable. This is is our 4th model of the Olympus Stylus so we are not newbies to this Series, though we are on the simple side of taking photos & videos.The most important features when purchasing such a camera are the following 3 features:1) Waterproof up to 33ft: This is big for us since most of our destinations are for surf and I also like to take it surfing...in Big Waves!2) Shockproof from 6.6ft. Between myself, my wife and my little girl...you better believe that there is going to be an occasional drop or 23) Freeze proof down to 14F / -10C If we are not in the waves, we like to go snowboarding in the mountains.Here is the newest of features that had us upgrade to the latest model - High Definition (HD) video. I just purchased the camera over the weekend and have taken amazing HD video while surfing out on the North Shore of Hawaii...and the waves were big and it kept ticking.The 8010 has many features for picture taking though it has been simplified so that anyone can open the box and start taking quality photos & video right out of the box.One feature that I very much enjoy, is the dedicated Camera & Video button so that you do not have to change modes when in action.A disadvantage that I have found is that you have to have your camera plugged in to charge.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Water resistant but not waterproof", "Author": "KHD", "ReviewID": "R172NIC2P0RNDF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my second Olympus stylus.

It did a great job while getting splashed and submerged while kayaking but the first time I took it snorkling (after carefully inspecting the seals due to my previous experience) it leaked in less than 10 feet of water.

For this it is awesome, the videos come out clear with good sound. The picture quality is good when taking pictures, not great but almost. It seems to take much better pictures outside than inside, but for what the camera is, and for what it was built for I am very impressed. I would not purchase this as your primary camera, my biggest complaint is that there is a LONG delay when taking a picture or starting to take a video. I carry around a Casio Exilim in my purse and the speed at which it takes pictures and recovers is like lightening compared to the Olympus Stylus 8010.Other than the delay in between shots, I don't have a single complaint. I took this thing rafting down class IV and V rapids in which it was repeatedly submerged in water and banged around by rocks and paddles... I also took it diving with me at the Denver Aquarium, everyone was extremely impressed with it, it took fantastic video and I got some great shots, the other divers and instructors were all asking how much it cost and where they could get one. The water resistance has been great, I went diving around 25 feet for about an hour and it did just fine.If you are avid about water sports or are going diving on vacation or something this camera is totally worth it, but I would not purchase this as my primary camera.If you want to see how great the quality is you can check out my scuba video which was taken with this Olympus Stylus-tough 8010  at[...]There are also just still pictures at the very end that were taken underwater.Hope this helps good luck!", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't buy the hype", "Author": "Wild Wood", "ReviewID": "R2BAW34DOFDKZS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been an Olympus customer for a long time, but would think twice about popping over $300 for this camera and its \"ad ons\".

Abalos", "ReviewID": "R2YZST4XU95J0C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just returned from a 5 day backpacking trip in the California Sierras traveling along both the John Muir and Pacific Crest Trails. This is some of the most spectacular backcountry in the US. I took my Olympus Tough TG-810 because it's \"shockproof\" and \"waterproof\" -- two things you want on this kind of trip. The only thing it didn't do was take decent video. In fact the quality was utter crap. As soon as I got home I uploaded the still images -- which were ok -- but the video -- the reason I took this camera instead of any of the others I have that can take both still and video images -- was painful to watch. Let me be clear, I spent more than 20 years working in TV production so I know how to use gear and I know how to take quality digital images. In addition to professional digital cameras, I have used point and shoot cameras that shoot both stills and video successfully on many trips; Nikon Coolpix 310 and the 510; Sony Cyber shot W80 (put this one in an underwater housing and used it to shoot very decent diving video) and W650 both w/ Zeiss lenses, . But this camera, and I use that term loosely, was horrible. I knew it while I was shooting. What I was playing back was horrible -- shaky (stabilization?), no consistent focus (nothing ever seems to stay in focus) and the exposure! it was either too hot or under-exposed. No matter what settings I tried the camera shot crap video. There was no way to put it down and pick up another camera -- I was backpacking and had to choose. I chose wrong. Don't make that mistake. There are many \"tough\" point and shoot cameras on the market that shoot both high quality digital stills and video. This camera is not one of them...and did I forget to mention the price? This is one of the most expensive! I buy Sony and Nikon cameras. I like Canon but haven't owned many.

As soon as I got it, I installed everything the way I was supposed to.  I tried some test shots and used it around the house and at different events (a parade, a school concert) and was happy with the quality of the pictures and was blown away at the software and its ability to tag faces and it seemed very accurate.  Then, the problems began.  IT wouldn't turn on. Or once it did, it would show a dark screen and the shutter would close. I would remove the battery and memory card, then replace them and turn it on.  It would work for a few shots, then freeze up again.  This happened over and over again.  I missed a lot of great sights on the tours because I was fiddling with my camera.  I should have just soaked it all in and kept my mental images instead of hoping for photographs.  I let my daughter use my \"old\" samsung point and soot camera.  She got great pictures.  I have since taken it back from her and use it as my primary camera.  I tried (even during the trip) re-initializing the camera via the software.  I did a full factory reset.  It worked for a while then started with the freezing up again.  Now, when I turn it on, it will show what I am pointing at in the LCD screen, but when I push the shutter button, the screen turns black or it will just completely turn off.  I am very disappointed with this camera.  I will go with a samsung next time.  They have great cameras for lower prices, and I don't think I will need the underwater capabilities anymore. It would be nice if it were water proof just because you never know when it will rain or get dropped, but its not worth the hassle of not having it work wet or dry.

Don't even think of capturing moving objects. Not even in the sports mode!The only way to maybe get one sharp image of a moving object is to have it on multiple image mode and hope that one of a series of 10 or so is good....And forget about shooting night pictures with this sluggish camera.I don't even want to think back to al those cool animals and events I missed on this camera!Another complaint is that the lens cover sometimes gets stuck in the casing.We complained right after we got back from our first trip.Unfortunately, because it was beyond the 30 day warranty, Olympus did not want to offer any replacement or solution.They blamed it on a too big memory card (8 Gigabytes) and us using the wrong settings.However, we already tried smaller memory cards (Mbs instead of Gigs) and restored factory settings.No improvements, and therefore really UNSATISFIED costumers, who really tried everything to make this camera work, and now will NEVER buy a personal Olympus product again!Tip: if you ever buy a camera online right before your trip, make sure you know what you're getting. Preferably test one in a store or know from friends how it works and get exactly that same model!Good luck with your waterproof camera search!", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Barely Functions", "Author": "Rev.", "ReviewID": "R3DUIUEO9URTA2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very heavy and very slow.

The SDHC slot was damaged because a tiny pin was bent backwards, causing the camera to be inoperable.  (No...I didn't try to put in the card backwards)Third Failure: The repaired Tough 8010 lens cover was jammed open and couldn't close, causing the camera to be inoperable.Description of Failures:I originally purchased the Tough 6020 camera to be used on my 2010 Iraq deployment.  I had it protected in a case and stowed in a pouch in my vest.  The product was found a few hours later to have a dent on the front panel.  Despite the 200 lbs. load the camera was claimed to withstand; it would not work.  I sent it to Olympus, as the camera was covered under a year warranty.  The product was repaired, but could not be mailed back to me because Olympus is not able to mail to addresses overseas.  I had the camera shipped home and decided to give it to my parents.  In the mean time, I purchased a newer, Tough 8010 and had it mailed to me in Iraq via Amazon.After I received my new Tough 8010, I inserted the SDHC memory card correctly.  I took pictures, but couldn't save them on my memory card. I took out the card and reinserted it.  It still wouldn't work.  After inspecting the SDHC memory card slot, I discovered a tiny pin to be bent backwards.  The camera was covered under factory warrantee, so it was sent to Olympus for repairs.  After the camera was repaired and sent to my home, my parents sent the camera back to me.  This process took months to complete; so I didn't get many pictures taken during my deployment in Iraq. Awesome...I know...After returning home from my deployment in 2011, I was using the camera in a park.  The camera mysteriously stopped working because the lens cover was stuck open.  I sent the camera back to Olympus because it was still covered under factory warrantee.

However, this would never work out.The menus seemed great and I liked the fact that the information was readily available for each setting.  Really Cool!  That's the good stuff.When I started taking pictures was when I really got disappointed.  In the water regardless of setting, auto focus/spot/faces or fast shutter speed or auto, shadow adjust on/off or auto etc. etc. the pictures were out of focus and blurry.  Of hundreds of pictures I took not one pic or video was in focus.  I was getting so mad in the line up because it continued to focus on what I didn't want it to capture, never on the center of the screen in spot focus and auto focus always picked some random piece of water to focus on.  The videos were constantly going in and out of focus...like every 2 seconds, so It was painful to watch.  And this was also while I was filming standing on the beach.  There was just too much activity for the camera to stay focused on what I wanted it too.  Again, I tried every setting.On top of this the pictures will randomly show up very dark, as in barely bright enough to see anything, and this was on a bright day on the beach.  It looked like night time with no flash honestly.  This, again, would happen with all different setting configurations, I tried everything.  Further, the flash always goes off making the bright room even darker, even on the odd chance the picture didn't turn out in it's typical \"night mode\"(what I have come to call the dark pictures).  And finally, when the picture does stay bright, and I have manually turned the flash off...again...the picture is blurry.  There is a little red icon of a shaking camera that pops up in the upper left corner.  This happens 90% of the time, even when its resting on a solid surface...  and with EVERY setting.I have never wanted to throw something against a wall so badly in my life.I have tried to figure it out, stupidly, over several more vacations (guess who always had the worst pictures), thinking that it was something I was doing wrong, but I have finally given up.

On the first day I had it, the battery ran out extremely quickly, and the pictures were shakey and lacking 'spark'. This camera broke within 30 minutes of its second use. I was fooling around with it in the sea on day 2, and the window cover became stuck halfway between open and closed. I managed to fix it that night in the hotel room by jamming a key into the space a forcing it closed. The problem repeated itself daily for the rest of the trip.

I really like the new toughness in this solid camera. For the most part it takes great pictures. Sometimes even better than my DSLR. I recently took it on a Ski trip and it handled the cold weather great, skiing and snow mobiling. I shot in Snow & Beach mode most of the time. I wish the software would remember the last user mode though, because it always defaulted to another mode. So every time I switched on, I had to navigate to Snow mode. Bummer. My older 1030SW seemed to have a better user interface. Don't even bother with the AUtomatic Panorama mode. It sucked terribly. You are better off stitching your own panorama yourself.Underwater: A mode I hold precious and dear as I Scuba and Snorkel a lot. I thought the extra latch locking mechanism would be fantastic. Well, when I was in Australia this January snorkeling on a camping trip, after a few shots the damn thing leaked. And I wasn't deeper than 7 ft. How disappointing is that? The rest of the time was shot with my iPhone.Luckily, Olympus had an authorized repairer in Perth just 20 minutes from where I stayed. So with my Amazon receipt and Online registration receipt, they handled the repair in a day and a half. Very impressive.The HD video quality was more than acceptable for me. Looked good on a 1080p 40\" flat screen TV. I mostly share video online with friends, so I don't need much more than that.WOUld I buy again? Maybe, If I could be assured of the Waterproof-ness.

Shortly afterwards, and with little reason, the front panel was dented causing the camera to be inoperable.Second Failure: I replaced the old camera for the new Tough 8010.  The SDHC slot was damaged because a tiny pin was bent backwards, causing the camera to be inoperable.  (No...I didn't try to put in the card backwards)Third Failure: The repaired Tough 8010 lens cover was jammed open and couldn't close, causing the camera to be inoperable.Description of Failures:I originally purchased the Tough 6020 camera to be used on my 2010 Iraq deployment.  I had it protected in a case and stowed in a pouch in my vest.  The product was found a few hours later to have a dent on the front panel.  Despite the 200 lbs. load the camera was claimed to withstand; it would not work.  I sent it to Olympus, as the camera was covered under a year warranty.  The product was repaired, but could not be mailed back to me because Olympus is not able to mail to addresses overseas.  I had the camera shipped home and decided to give it to my parents.  In the mean time, I purchased a newer, Tough 8010 and had it mailed to me in Iraq via Amazon.After I received my new Tough 8010, I inserted the SDHC memory card correctly.  I took pictures, but couldn't save them on my memory card. I took out the card and reinserted it.  It still wouldn't work.  After inspecting the SDHC memory card slot, I discovered a tiny pin to be bent backwards.  The camera was covered under factory warrantee, so it was sent to Olympus for repairs.  After the camera was repaired and sent to my home, my parents sent the camera back to me.  This process took months to complete; so I didn't get many pictures taken during my deployment in Iraq. Awesome...I know...After returning home from my deployment in 2011, I was using the camera in a park.  The camera mysteriously stopped working because the lens cover was stuck open.  I sent the camera back to Olympus because it was still covered under factory warrantee.

The first time I took it under water it leaked. I sent it in for repairs.  Next time I took it in water it leaked immediately. I sent it for repair a second time.

They said the only option is to send it for repair but the fact that it was over 6 months from the last repair, I would have to pay for it.  What a waste of money.

I looked online, and it didn't look like Olympus backed the product for water damage, so i didn't try to return it (it was also over a year old, so therefore out of the warranty period), but nevertheless, i think its a design flaw that will keep me from buying another one.

I really love the layout of this camera and the looks are just stunning but I just couln't get passed the bad pictures. So it's just personal I guess. I'm going to try out the Pentex W90 now.

I bought your camera, and it comes with no charger, no manual, and no memory card. I will give you the card and the charger, but trying to charge me $10 to send a manual so I can learn how to use it. Ya gotta be kidding right? Absolutely not. $10 for a manual, or sit on the phone for hours to ask questions. How they figure this is more productive than including a manual is beyond me. There is a reason ther is an hour wait. I don't even know if the camera is any good cause I can't use anything but the simple functions without a manual. I actually took a picture, but can't view it! Movies forget it, flash maybe it has one, I can't find it.  If for no other reason, this camera is going back because of the rudeness of Olympus. I have had to ask for the manual before from other cheap companies, but not been charged. Yes Olympus I want to print out 100 pages with my printer so you can pretend you are green, all the while I am using thrice the paper you would, and still not satisfied with a clumsy loose leaf manual. If I did print it out, I would need to carry around a full 9 x11 book instead of one that fit in the camera case. Duh!!!!!!!!
