In general, you can only get a CMOS camera or a fake camera at this price. But now we can get a High Resolution Wide View Angle CCD camera from Warehouseseller. They shipped my packaged so fast. It only takes 3 days to delivery my door. I opened the box, all was new and everything was there. It only took 3 minutes to mount it. It is easy to use. It can capture sharp image and made of plastic.I'm pleased with this purchase. I installed it in front of my door. And I must say the build-in 3.6mm wide angle lens is very useful. I get a wide view angle through this camera. Now almost whole garden is in my sight. Everything is safe now.I highly recommend this VideoSecu good price quality camera!!!!!!", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than my Night Owl system cameras", "Author": "Nothing matters", "ReviewID": "R3GPBFTEMBLZW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this to swap out the cameras that came with my FS-8500 system from Night Owl. I needed a wider view. When I saw it, I thought, this little thing can't beat my $400 system. When I plugged it in and took a look, I was shocked. The colors were bright; the view was crisp and clear. Compared to my regular cameras, this thing left me wanting to use the cameras that came with my system as dummy cameras instead. By the way, Night Owl is the biggest piece of . . .", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "works well for the money", "Author": "Ernman \"Ernman\"", "ReviewID": "R1HSL69DGUNDAP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "there are a lot of cctv cameras with the 1/3 and 1/4\" ccd lens, with and without night vision, coming out of china.  personally, they are all about the same and worth about $25.00 (prolly made by the same factory too). any more $$ and you are wasting ur money. It has a good quality pix but the color is off. that is why i gave it a 4-star. but unless you need pan/scan/zoom or need to see a fly on the wall across the room...these are great security cameras.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best I've found for the price........", "Author": "Rl Shuey", "ReviewID": "R3DPFLYL0O2C23", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has great day viewing (CCD sure beats CMOS) for the price, but I was surprised at how great the night vision is without IR. I removed the camera from its mount (I know this voids the warr.) and made a pedestal mount so that the camera can sit on the inside windowsill of my front window facing the street. Even without IR, the street lights provide enough light that I can still see approx. 80% of what I can see in the daylight and that works for me. I only found one small con and that is: I wish they had not made it with such a wide angle lens, because it covers a larger area than I need, which makes everything smaller than I would like and it also causes the lens to have some fish eye to the view. But bottom line is that the price/performance ratio of this thing is so great, I can live with the small con. I like it so well that I'll probably will be buying more of these in the future to replace the CMOS cameras that I have.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera rating", "Author": "doc dre", "ReviewID": "RCW8HV5T69NP8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the camera is a good camera they said it was color but it show in black an white other than that it a good.ed ce", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the price", "Author": "Timothy", "ReviewID": "REMQAV7BOHRHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had it up and running in under an hour hooked up to a DVR.
