It works beautifully for projecting anything i put under it - and it has a light if needed, but it works fine with the lighting in my classroom.  Other teachers spend way more for the elmo which is no better than this epson and way clunkier, this folds beautifully and is very compact.  Our district provides a cheap doc. camera that never is clear or has lighting problems so I invested in this- I can demonstrate writing ect.. while my first graderss see all the images projected very clearly and can follow with me- What a tool!  Had to have someone help me install it, it wasn't hard, just not what I'm used to. Beautfully, I am able to install in on my Mac and Windows side (I thought it was just for Mac) Every teacher is jealouse of me now or mad that they paid so much for the Elmo. Even stores that carry this same camera have it for way more than what I got it for.  I never made a single purchase for my class as big as this, but I cut back on my Oriental Trading junk and found this to be a much better tool than anything I have ever invested in.  Took a chance, and am very happy!", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well worth the cost!", "Author": "Tom Gannon", "ReviewID": "R14LDIMC2P3I7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use, portable, I can use it with my computer or just my projector!

I thought it would be a lot better than it actually was. I did little research and went solely on reviews and  brand... bad idea!  It worked ok for a few days.  The cameraq was easy to connect and to install the software.  However, within a few days the zoom button just wouldn't work and the clarity of the projection was poor.  Every time that I switched from camera to screen, I would have to readjust the brightness because it was too bring to the point where you couldn't see anything but the paper.  I would not recommend this camera... too expensive for its quality of picture  .  This product looks good on paper but doesn't meet the its specifications nor my desired needs.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.00", "Features": "0.75\" CMOS\n2 Megapixel", "Name": "Epson DC-06 Document Camera, PC/Mac", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21EyNr9yVKL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003LD1VOC"}}
