Overall the menus and settings are easy to use. The display is very easy to see even in broad daylight. I have two problems though. First, the red cover over the place where the lens adapter screws on kept falling off and was eventually lost after just a few days. Sad that the quality of this part does not match the quality of the camera. Secondly, the quality of the pictures using the digital zoom is poor.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera. So-so kit.", "Author": "A Shire Reeve", "ReviewID": "R2OBK8JO9EJ9HZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the camera for several weeks now. I took the camera on a rafting trip, during a heavy rain. The pictures were good - biggest problem was keeping raindrops/water drops from settling on the lens (impossible). Seems something Rain-X is warranted.Dry pictures and underwater pictures are excellent. The camera controls are really easy to use, and don't accidentally change when you least expect it.I've found that indoor / lower-light pictures tend towards an orange tint. May be user error, but still exploring...The kit is mostly a sales gimmick. The only useful piece is the flotation armpiece -- I already have one camera at the bottom of a river. It's not well designed though - no consideration for securing the camera if your arm happens to be attached to an oar -- the camera bangs about helplessly while you're paddling.The camera is tough though, it seemed unfazed at all the banging - we even played catch with it for a while. Not sure I would use it as a hacky-sack (my old HP 16-C calculator was THAT tough).", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "PERFECT!!", "Author": "gcsimmons", "ReviewID": "R1JEVR2X92ECZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used this camera on a recent vacation in Hawaii and it took stunning pictures, outstanding video, and even pretty darn good audio.  I wish I would have played with it more beforehand so that I knew there was a special underwater setting.  The underwater shots I took were great, but I wonder if they would have been better with the camera in the proper mode.  Highly recommend it for amateurs that just want to take memories home with them without fumbling with a lot of different settings.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "SewIn2Disney", "ReviewID": "R2QFLLSSI5ZGKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My fianc\u00e9 and I are going on our honeymoon in a month and I bought 4 waterproof cameras to test- this camera was definitely tied for first in terms of photo quality.To read my full review (including my photo tests) , check out my blog post:http://handmadeisbetterblog.com/2013/06/21/choosing-the-best-underwater-camera/", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$379.00", "Features": "TG-2\nUltra-Compact Digital Camera Deluxe Carrying Case - CA15B\n16GB Secure Digital SD Memory Card\n3pc.
