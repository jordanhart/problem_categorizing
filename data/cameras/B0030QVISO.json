It's a nicely-styled, inexpensive camera if you want a \"looker\" and wish to be seen with something different. The top plate is made of some thin but durable metal as is the bottom plate. The batt compartment door is made of plastic and contrary to what others have written, never had problems with it being difficult to open; and it secures shut just as reliably. The brown leatherette (prolly not leather) is nicely affixed to the camera, with a convincing texture, look, and even smell. The optical viewfinder is mainly for show and is not accurate for precise framing - only good for taking big scenics and the lens set at its widest. If you're thinking of saving some power by using the optical finder and turning off the LCD, forget it - because the LCD can't be turned off at all. The LCD is big and bright and the information displays are clear and easy to dicipher/read. LCD color is accurate. The camera shoots in widescreen (16:9) mode and will preview the live image on the LCD; however the on-screen image temporarily reverts to 4:3 when actually shooting (but will save in 16:9) - an odd quirk. Although the camera will shoot still pics in HD, video is shot in just VGA. Face detection, anti-shake works as advertised. Maximum ISO is only 400 and the maximum lens aperture is just f/2.8, so shooting dimly-lit or nite scenes with existing light requires a tripod. Flash is surprisingly not harsh when shooting group photos of friends, with subjects/area evenly lit between 7-15 feet and amazingly no red-eye. The control beepers cannot be turned off as far as I can tell. Specs say it can accept up to 8GB SD cards but it has accepted a Sandisk 32GB SDHC card with no problems. Batt life is good, allowing for a couple hours of continuous shooting (a power saver mode turns off the camera after a set time, so I've gone all day shooting with it). There are larger capacity batts on sale for it on Amazon.com. A enjoyable, functional camera with fair build quality that has served me for a couple of years with no trouble at all, and has produced so many good pics and of course garnered a lot of attention when out in the public. Highly recommended if you want to have a fun time photographing. //", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap", "Author": "Smith Point", "ReviewID": "R343CNUL16TVCY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It works in good light and with the flash on.  However, cloudy days and fast moving objects don't look good.

(i saw this written before by other user as well). Only after using a thin screwdriver it was possible to pry it open. After this first time, it opened up normally using some finger pressure. No memory card included and the internal memory can handle the incredable amount of 1 (yes, one) picture.Nice old style camera, but some of the advertised 8.1 MP disappeared somehow, it only has 3.0 MP. Still ok for just taking basic size pictures.There is a bit of a greenish colour over the picture, which should not be there.The build quality is okay for the price, but care has to be taken with the painted plastic casing surrounding the lcd screen, because the paint comes of quite easily.Conclusion: you have to like it more because of the retro style then because of the picture taking qualities.It will perform amazingly well inside a showcase though.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0030QVISO"}}
