It is so easy to carry around with you. I use the MP3 function daily, and now also have a camera on me at all times to take shots of interesting things.  I also use the video function a fair bit - just need to figure out how to email video \"greetings\" to people.  I plan on using it to email birthday wishes to friends/family.The buttons on the camera are small, but fairly easy to use - I don't have any difficulty using them.  The on/off button is quite close to the power button so you need to be careful which one you are pressing.  It is very easy to add MP3s onto the camera - connect the camera to your PC and copy and paste as you would move any other files.  Very simple!My only complaint about this product is the accompanying software is not user-friendly.  I don't like how it downloads all of your pictures into one library. It is very difficult to access a single picture because they are all lumped together in a combined file.  One minor concern is the battery - it uses a rechargable lithium battery.  So you need to put it into the cradle to recharge.  The battery is excellent(5 hours), but if the battery runs out, you can't just run to the store and buy more.  This hasn't posed a problem for me, but is something to be aware of if you are planning on using the camera all day (i.e. don't play the MP3 player when you are out taking pictures for the day if you don't have access to your recharger)The 12MB onboard memory is enough for just taking pictures.  If you plan on using the MP3 function, and taking full advantage of the video and sound recording capabilities, you need to buy a SD memory card (these are pricey).  I originally bought a 64MB card, which gives you about 1 hour of music play (but that uses up the card).  I recently purchased a 256MB card and recommend others purchase at least 128MB.  I have over 40 songs on my 256MB card, and still have room for over 300 normal sized pictures, or about 16 30-second videos. For everyday use, this is perhaps too much memory, but if you plan on travelling, you'll need it.This product is perfect for anyone who travels a fair bit.  I really like how it combines several useful features into one product. I don't know how good the quality of the pictures are in professional terms.  I am just your average user - the pics look great to me.  This camera also comes in a 1.2 megapixel version - I purchased this one (2.0 megapixel) because the pictures had better depth.  There is only a 4X digital zoom - this means your pictures lose clarity as you zoom in.  The latest version of this camera has an optical zoom, but the camera is about twice as thick, and does not include the MP3 player. I find the 4X digital zoom is adequate for my needs.

The thing is just amazing.  Simple to use, in a beautiful, sturdy, magnesium, credit-card sized body. And the battery lasts ages.  Picture quality on the lower resolution settings isn't so good, and the digital zoom is rubbish, but that's hardly the point.  This is a camera for snaps, moments where you just want to reach into your pocket and snap what's in front of you.  The computer interface is a doddle - I use it with my Mac, and all the file formats are standard so you can use it with just about anything.

This is the smallest digital camera out there, but its size isn't reflected in storage capacity or features.  I took over 70 pictures at 640x480 normal resolution and was very happy with the image quality when uploaded to my pc (it holds over 50 640x480 at the best imgage quality without additional memory and can take up to 1600x1200).  The LED screen is bright and clear which makes it easy to frame your photos without using the view finder (which can be difficult given the camera's size).  It powers on quickly (app 2 seconds) and has only a minimal shutter delay.  It also powers off on its own to save battery life, but so far I haven't had any problems with running low.  The audio and video quality are good when uploaded, but the audio playback speaker on the camera itself is a little muted and tinny (which is to be expected).  This is definitely a daytime or close-in nighttime camera as the effective flash distance is about 10 feet, but you will be surprised at the quality of images you get from a camera this small (about half the size of a cigarette pack).The only drawbacks are 1) no optical zoom and 2) the LED screen is exposed, so it frequently gets fingerprinted, and 3) the power and shutter buttons are next to each other so it's easy to shut the camera off when you're trying to take a picture. However, these are minor flaws in design that are well outweighed by the EX-M2's ease of use and versatility.  This is a solid camera at a great price and highly recommended for people looking for a good point and shoot digital.
