Basically you could move the camera, no sound, could not alter advanced features, and could not change user name and password (had to keep resetting the device).  Returned product.  Probably not a bad purchase for PC, but couldn't be sure because minimal functionality.  Is there any decent IP camera out there for us Mac users?", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "Users can view using a standard web browser or any mobile device\nUser account & password protection\n2-way audio to camera for talk back\nPan & tilt function allows full view of camera location\nAllows users to record video locally to a PC", "Name": "Security Labs SLW-163 Wireless Pan and Tilt IP Camera with IR", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WJ8XWKzcL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005OYDVPI"}}
