I was looking for a good quality but affordable digital camera. It seems to take okay pics inside but the outside pictures are always washed out no matter what lighting I have. I have tried all the different settings and wonder if this is just a defect of this model. It has been over 90 days now so it looks like I'm up the creek with this one, I can't get an exchange at Walmart either. I will never buy from Sanyo again...", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "This camera is worthless", "Author": "E.

Battery died, bought new ones, lens remains out, camera LCD screen blank, nothing works, not reset procedure in manual.....need I go on?  This is a worthless $100 dollar piece of crapola.  No more Sanyo for me!Update 10-6-13  Had boxed defective camera and sent back to Sanyo USA with searing hot complaint message.  Lo and Behold several months later a new Sanyo camera appeared from nowhere.  Well, they tried and I guess I appreciate the thought but I had already purchased a Canon, so the replacement will be a gift at Christmas for someone...hope it works, last one didn't and thanks Sanyo for the replacement...even if it took forever.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for a great price!", "Author": "Shelly Hendrix", "ReviewID": "R2S6JVUMF871N1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like the other reviewer says, you have to change the settings for inside shots. That is typical of most cameras where lighting may be dim. I think this is a great camera and cant beat the price! My pictures always turn out great and I print them from the Kodak site. If you want to take professional pictures, you might want to spend $300 + more dollars to get it.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Digi cam", "Author": "dude from small town", "ReviewID": "RQ9L3R614F53N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "well i bought this cam from walmart about 3 months ago, im pretty well satisfied, it takes good pictures outside BUT you have to set it up completely different if you want to take pictures inside, menus are crude and they can take some time for you to get used to. overall its a decent little camera, once you get over all its rough edges", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Slim and sleek, this camera is perfect for capturing high quality stills!\n10-Megapixel High Quality Stills - 3x Optical Zoom Lens\nDigital Image Stabilizer - Face Detection - Smile Detection - Red-Eye Removal\nRechargeable Li-ion battery - Supports SD/SDHC Memory Cards\nDigital Image Stabilizer", "Name": "Sanyo Xacti VPC-T1060 10MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom 2.8 LCD - Black\"", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/316JmC%2BIs8L.jpg", "ProductID": "B001QV2Y4M"}}
