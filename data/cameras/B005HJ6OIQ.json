{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect!.... Almost...", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R115TVZ2LIMEHS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this item to keep tabs on a couple of Golden Retriever puppies that have to be kept in their luxury apartment downstairs at night.I mounted it in one corner of the room with the optional ceiling mount, perfect. It gives a full view of the entire area, with the pan and tilt features, perfect. Requires no wiring other than plugging in the ac adapter! Perfect!Really quiet during pan and tilt operations, doesn't disturb the dogs. It operates in zero light (the dog's eyes, when open, look like headlights on a car.. really cute!).I've always have had perfect reception from the camera, picture and sound, from my bedroom to the dog's room downstairs, approx 200 feet. The color is good with adequate light, has black and white pic with the infrared LEDs for illumination during no light conditions, but that's okay. Hooked it to my Sony HDTV with the included 1/8\" to RCA video/audio cable and had decent pic and sound.Features: I love the pan, tilt, zoom, sound without pic option (using the included earphone, good for not disturbing others while monitoring, invert picture option when hanging upside down, and especially the ability to take the receiver anywhere in the house (wireless when using batteries).The only improvement I could suggest... built in rechargeable batteries that would charge with the supplied ac adapter. I don't know why they didn't do that? Would have been a perfect solution for me if they had, but, I'll just get 4 AAA rechargeables and recharge them with an external charger.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great baby/elderly monitor", "Author": "David Wong", "ReviewID": "R3M2LRVU5DVX0R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like all its features and everything works well. I am pleased with the FHSS technology feature which helps to keep privacy. My suggestion for next model: 1) Increase resolution to at least SDTV (Standard TV) level or better. 2) Optional remote ON/OFF control. 3) More refined zoom control.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Okay Product", "Author": "Al Germaine \"Al\"", "ReviewID": "R1P48B1NZBNL1J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Timely delivery.
