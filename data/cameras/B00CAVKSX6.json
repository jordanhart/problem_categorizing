{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "Dona", "ReviewID": "R2EWGLXVHP4JDG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this because we have the canon rebelX and it is to big and bulky but we had purchased a great zoom lens. We were headed to Alaska on an 8 day cruise and I dreaded the thought of carrying that camera everywhere. I ordered this and it showed up one day before we left!!This little baby got me close for some great pictures. In fact the zoom was the same as the one for the canon we had purchased. It was small enough I could carry it everywhere. The color and resolution is amazing. These pictures are better then the big canon.This package wow! The Tripod I figured it would be a small tripod you know like the little rubber ones, oh no it was a very nice tall one. I used it on our balcony for pictures when we went thru the Fjord. Everything was better then I had hoped.The one drawback is when you use the video recorder it will drain your battery very fast. This package has an extra which was a big help and the charger was very fast at recharging. I did not do any video after the I saw how fast it drained it, I had so many more pictures to take to be without.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$289.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon PowerShot SX280 HS Digital Camera (Red) + <2> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card + <3> Spare NB-6L Battery +\n<4> Battery Charger + <5> PD C190D Digital Camera Case + <6> Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod +\n<7> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable + <8> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <9> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<10> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <11> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <12> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Canon PowerShot SX280 HS Digital Camera (Red) with 32GB Card + Case + Battery & Charger + Tripod + HDMI Cable + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/613pEfPKRWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CAVKSX6"}}
