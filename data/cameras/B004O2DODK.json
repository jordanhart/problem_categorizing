{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Rather have Less", "Author": "Jimmy", "ReviewID": "R3MCBC9KZFXY2K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this package last week and must say i am real happy with the overall package price. How-ever there is a few items that i must say is so low quality & really isn't suitable for the camera it came with.The full size tripod is not close enough to be sturdy enough for this camera & would only have the worry that it would fall over at some point. Mini Tripod also, is only good enough for a small point & shoot digi cam.The flash gun, again too under-rated (specs) & low quality for a camera of this type.The camera bag is far to small to carry the camera & equipment that was in the package. Barely enough room to carry the camera with Lens attached & battery charger and that is all you get inside it.As i said though, overall this is a great deal. But i had to go out & purchase a new bag, tripod & a proper flash which has cost me approx. $500 at the local shops. No heartache really, but it did cost me more time to go and get these items. If i had known at the time of the order, i would of purchased these extras through Amazon at the time of the camera order & also saved more money this way.What i would rather see included in this package, is for the above items to be removed and have the suppliers include a more suitable backpack style bag. I just think it's better to have less in the package, but have more quality & suitable items especially with a camera of this quality.I hope this helps spme people out there that are looking to buy this or a similar package.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Off brand accessories break on the job", "Author": "Media Steve \"Media Steve\"", "ReviewID": "R1H3XV4T7O613P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this package for the t3i's hd video capabilities. First day I took it out on the job the case's strap broke. Next the charger broke. The tripod was terrible from the start. And just now while shooting a music video for a dj for my internship the sd card broke on me for no explainable reason. All of the Zeikos and Digital Film accessories are absolutely horrible. If you're willing to spend this much money on the camera and lenses alone, go for it. If you want quality accessories to go with it, don't buy from Sunset.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Auto features are for me! Love it! It's like a point and shoot on steroids!", "Author": "mlwright", "ReviewID": "R272V5TUGL0K2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've not had my camera long and have only taken 200 pictures, but let me tell you, I am impressed!  Don't get me wrong, I know very little about cameras.  I am not a photographer.  I just want to take good pictures of family, friends, places and everyday life in general.  That being said, I am an outdoor person, hunting & fishing and wanted to take better wildlife pictures.  I chose this camera because of the reviews and all the auto features. I chose this package because it included the \"IS\" lenses and the best price.  I took pictures of deer in the woods behind my house, that I literaly couldn't see until viewing through the camera's zoom lense and the pictures were great. The everyday pictures around the house are great as well, there is much more depth in the pictures. As I am not a photographer I do not have the word bank to describe the difference.  Auto focus is for definitly me.  I do plan on taking classes so that someday I can play with all of the manual features but until then, THIS CAMERA MAKES ME A MUCH BETTER PHOTOGRAPHER!", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wrong battery charger.", "Author": "Pinkcat", "ReviewID": "R3OTU72G1RB2GR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered the Canon EOS Rebel T31 complete package deal.

That was worth it. What is completely useless are the tripod, camera bag and I received an 8gb SD card not 16gb. The seller did try to contact me before he shipped it out...that said I called back 3 times and got no return phone call...I assume it was about the 16gb card. I got the bundle a day later. it seems he threw in a few extra camera batteries to make up the difference...which is fine...I don't care about that so much. But the tripod is way to flimsy for the weight of that camera. The Camera Bag is way to small. It also came with a sub par flash...however it's not useless. I bought a Canon 580EX II Speedlite flash separately and will use the flash that came with the kit as a secondary slave. If it were a dream kit...I would take out the current tripods, camera bag, and flash and replace them with a decent tripod that can handle the weight of the T3i.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon T3i Rebel w/Zoom Pro Accessories Kit", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R1697V9OQRDL0J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The package I purchased included: Canon T3i body and 18-55 mm IS-II lens kit, Canon 55-250mm IS-II lens, a wide angle lense, a 2x telephoto lense, a macro lense, additional car/wall socket battery charger, 2 additional Vivitar batteries, 16gb class 10 20Mb/s SDHC card, Zekios camera bag, Zekios full size tripod, Zekios 3-pc filter set(UV, CPL, FL), mini tripod, Vivitar external flash, SDHC card reader, screen protectors, camera cleaning kit, 2 microfiber cloths. The Canon T3i camera body is all I can handle as a novice. It has every feature I could want or probably need at my skill level. Both Canon lenses take great photos and feel sturdy enough to stand the test of time. They are however noisy when auto-focusing. I haven't used them on manual focusing yet, so can not comment on their effectiveness. The batteries last a long time. I have already snapped ~500 photos and am still running strong on the first battery which is one of the Vivitar's.  I have used the screw on macro lense and have had mixed results with it. I have a few great shots of a bug up close with it that are clear all around and some fuzzy shots of a flower, so maybe it is just my lack of photography skill that is keeping me from using it to it's full potential. Both tripods are junk. The full size is very plasticy and feels like it wouldn't hold up for very long and be very hard to get adjusted properly. The mini is plain stupid for a camera of this size, it barely fits my wife's little point and shoot. The Vivitar flash is very basic, it flashes and tilts but that is about it. The Zekios camara bag at first glance looks to be a good bag, but upon trying to load my camera and the rest of this kit's gear into it, it is too small and rather hard to get organized. I also have my doubts as to it's durability in the long term. The SDHC card has enough space for nearly 500 raw+jpg photos which is more than I will probably ever take in a single shooting, so am very pleased with it. It is also fast enough for my speed of shooting so far. I did take a couple HD videos with it and there were no studders. The card reader on the other hand is some no brand chinese garbage, in order for it to work, you have to carefully place the card into the reader before plugging the reader into the computer. It is also really slow to read the contents from the card. The screen protectors are not made for this camera's screen and have to be cut to proper size. The additional charger is very nice to have on a long trip. Overall this kit is good; however, you would probably be better off and maybe save a few dollars by just getting a couple extra batteries and saving your money for better hardware such as dedicated macro lenses, a really good camera bag, tripod, etc... I love the camera, just not so thrilled about the accessories.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good deal for a good combo", "Author": "networkpro", "ReviewID": "RT2W9318BD0Y9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Saw the review of the body over at imaging-resource.com and looked for a good price on it and included 2 Canon Image Stabilized Lenses to replace our Minolta (RIP) SLR and jump into the digital age. Body + the 2 Lenses was worth the price alone but when you add in the two extra batteries, extra charger (with car adapter for vacations) and 2 other lenses its a very good price.

It is clear that the rest of the products contained in the bundle are there to catch up you interest or attention, but, since you touch them, see them, you realize that they cost probably 2 to 3 dollar each.
