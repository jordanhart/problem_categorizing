Check out my utube channel by searching for dfizzbom and you'll find the vids. One is a mounting hack to help make mounting this camera more flexible, and one video covers how these cameras actually look in remote viewing. Be sure to check those vids out and I hope they help you.So far, I like these cameras. Eight of them came bundled with a q-see dvr package I picked up about a month ago. The cameras installed well and are still going strong. We've had seriously hot temps, fog, rain, and even storms and all is well. It is recommended you install these cameras under eves if possible. The more protected they are from direct weather on them, they better they'll fair in the long run. Daytime views are very accetable and the night vision is what you would expect- a bit grainy. But added outdoor lighting on the area helps clean the view right up. I recommend you not rely soley on this cameras IR ability in total outdoor darkness. For the best picture- add light. It cleans right up. But, 24 IR leds is actually decent too, so this camera will see in total darkness, albeit it grainy. Indoors in total darkness such as a stock room, the night vision is actually really good and not noisy. The bigger the space in total darkness, the more grainy the picture will be. Also, wrap weather proof electrical tape around the connection outdoors. That's a good habit to practice when installing any camera. Remember to check out my vids. A picture is worth a thousand words! There are better cameras to be had, but this one will perform well. At least it has for me and I have five currently installed.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Okay For the Price", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R220DMTJE0MTDR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the 8 camera set and everything worked when I first set them up.

I guess it depends what you want it for ... but I use these for watching outside my house on a Q-See recorder. It's not of a quality for making movies or something ... but for what I use it for it's great. My only gripe is it only has lateral left/right adjustment, ie, you can's turn the lens left/right to allow for angled mounting such as on a roof eve ... at least I haven't found a way ... that's why the 4 Star rating.
