Fossett", "ReviewID": "RYKX6CA2FMMQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have two young grandchildren and my son and daughter-in-law had needed a new camera desperately.  You just can't take decent pictures of babies on a cell phone!  I researched the web (and talked to camera store employees) and narrowed it down to the Canon PowerShot G15.  You should see the fine quality pictures I'm getting and my family says it's very easy to use.  They love it!", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the camera not sure about some other items", "Author": "RGB", "ReviewID": "R3QXZIX9ZUW56N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought the kit would have more useful items. Cleaning things are ok. Don't know about the small tripod. The extra battery is the best part. Probably should have gotten the camera, cable and extra battery, not this kit. The camera is excellent. Too bad it doesn't come with a user manual. Had to buy a book.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for non photographers", "Author": "Cornhusker", "ReviewID": "R20Q7PBO1HRPWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed something to take great photos for a web site. A photographer friend recommended this camera. I still don't know what all the dials are for. However, I set it on Auto, and even with no flash and low ambient light, the pictures are amazing. Getting the extra battery and chargers and other extras for one price are a bonus. The camera bag is very nice, better than the one in the photo. I am very pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal", "Author": "William Lewis", "ReviewID": "R1M2QBTNLKBWI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great.  It is lightweight without feeling cheap.  Just out of the box the camera takes better pictures than our little point and shoot.  If you are into amateur photography this camera would be a great choice.  The other parts of the package are just extras.  Two chargers and two batteries came with it which alone makes it worth more than the package not including the other items.  Great item! Very Pleased.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Package", "Author": "Judith", "ReviewID": "R2MLL8U47PRU99", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the camera.  The price was good for the package.  Just for the extra battery and charger alone, it was a good price.  but I got even more with the package...tripod, reader & sd card.
