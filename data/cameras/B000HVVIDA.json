I did not want her using my expensive camera.  It would not take any pictures unless in bright natural light.  When I went to install it on my computer it had the wrong software.  I downloaded the software to find out that this camera was defective.  Etoys replaced it at no cost, but the next one still wouldn't work with my computer or my neighbor's computer (and he's a computer tech.)This purchase was nothing but frustrating.  Spend the extra $[...]bucks and get a better camera.  This one isn't worth $[...].", "Date": "February 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's okay", "Author": "Victoria Ann Schafer", "ReviewID": "R4XUNT1DU7O4A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Probably not as hi tech as the newer digital cameras.  This one does an okay job for the megapixels it has to work with.  The problem is because it has only two buttons on top, you have to toggle through the button to get to delete photos, etc.  IT's a little too complicated for my 5 year old (the age group who likes barbies).  It's built well though and comes with the instructions and cables.  SO, if you can explain how to use it to your child and they understand, it's a good product.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Save your money", "Author": "Michal A.

We did a lot of research and after this camera went on sale for $25, we decided to give it a shot. Software was very easy for me to install, and downloading pics was a snap. No, the pictures aren't top quality, some come out blurry and dark, but it takes fairly good pictures outside (no flash). Once we set up our old computer for the kids, I'm sure she is going to love taking pictures and dowloading them herself. And if it is something she sticks with, there will definitely be an upgrade next Christmas (something w/ a flash and lcd screen). But after researching and looking around, this seems to be the best digital camera for kids for the price. Not to mention how cute it is for girls :)", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Waste if $", "Author": "T.
