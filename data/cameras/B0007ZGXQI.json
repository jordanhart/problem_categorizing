Basically we were looking for an inexpensive replacement for our old sony unit. Our main concerns were price and image quality. This one fit the bill on both we decided after our research. The size is quite small yet not small enough to be dropped easily or have it slip out of your hands. The image quality is great at this price and better then the alternatives in this range ($109). The digital zoom is just that and so my recommendations in regards to the zooom is to take your pics at the highest (S.Fine) setting and then zooming in and cropping the image via your image editing program.

You will want to max picture quality and picture size at the highest possible setting to get a good picture. If you use the digital zoom for close up pictures the quality of the picture looks very pixilated & poor in detail.  In my opinion the digital zoom is pointless on taking a good image. This camera has the option to record video, but it isn't that impressive. If you want to record video get a camcorder. You'll also need to invest in rechargeable batteries (+$25) and a SD card(+$18) which isn't something new for having a digital camera. I'm probably going to return the A402, and spend more money to get a camera with an optical zoom and 1 more MP (5MP).", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "TWO Years and still going strong!", "Author": "Natalie Maggiore \"Natalie\"", "ReviewID": "R2F2KXG6UFU0MS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great digital camera. I have no problems with it. i got it for my 1st anniversary 2 yrs ago. Its great! You can take pictures, and put xmas, valentines or birthday borders around them b4 you take the picture. It does video too, you can play back the video, but there is no sound because there is no speaker on the camera, there is a mic thuigh. So when you download the video, it will play the sound too. The camera has survivied being dropped many times. I would like to take long videos, so I am going to purchase a 4gb sd card. I feel sorry for all the people i saw complaining about the camera because i have no problems for 2 years now. The only thing is that the  batteries die quickly ( using the flash really drains the battery), so I went and bought high quality rechargable batteries, or the disposable duracell meant for digital cameras. also to the people who complained about blurry pictures, it depends what setting you have the camera on. I do not like all those different setings, they just mess up the pic. And do not use the auto feature I always use the non auto, egulr pic, with flash. All those other settings are confusing .

I go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. Well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. It would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. After changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. Alarmed, i called Samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. It only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again.But that was only one thing wrong with it. This is a horrible camera for concerts, the pictures are always blurry. Shoot, even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. Tuesday i went to see my fav band again, and the dumb thing goes white. It woudnt stop, no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. Now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. You can't trust this camera.

My only complaint (that's not worth downgrading the rating over) with this camera is that there isn't a regular viewfinder so you might be able to conserve battery power by turning the LCD viewfinder off and still see what your camera's pointing at.  My recommendation to the prospective buyer of this camera is to get a good sized SD card (128 or 256MB)and max out all the resolution settings for both the movie clips and the pictures.

I'm a little sad to see it go because it's been a good little camera for the most part, although it performed poorly in certain low-light situations.I dropped it on a stone-covered grave in Tombstone, AZ (that was probably about hot enough to fry an egg on at the time) about two years ago at a height of about four or five feet when I nearly fell over a young kid whose parents were allowing to follow me around. Except for a small scratch on the lens it came through the experience functioning just fine.But now, apparently simply due to age, it's stopped functioning normally. It thinks its batteries are low even when they're fresh, is not adjusting to light, and is taking very blurry pictures.Still, it took good photos for more than a year (probably closer to two) after being dropped, which is more than I expected in the moments after it actually happened.Pros: Has a good bit of internal storage, takes nice clear photos, is very compact, is very easy to use, has a landscape mode that takes great outdoor photos, and survived a heck of a fall.Cons: Was over-priced considering the features (no optical zoom, only a digital zoom, only 4 mega pixels), has a soft LCD screen, flashes three times in any flash-using mode (sounds like no big deal but it can be irritating, especially in my favorite setting - concerts, and drains the batteries), has a looong shutter delay, and does not do well in low light.MAJOR WARNING about the flash and low-light situations: If you turn off your flash in portrait mode, or use a low-light mode, the shutter delay becomes positively interminable because the shutter speed is slowed, which it does automatically. Because most of the photos I take are at concerts this is totally unacceptable. You have to hold incredibly still to take a photo that isn't severely blurred and your subject can't move for several seconds (I counted a shutter delay of over five seconds.)Leaving the flash on is often not an option because if you have a crowd in front of you you're going to get a better photo of the back of their heads than of the stage. This became infuriating and is for me probably the camera's biggest drawback. I eventually found a solution to this problem... electrical tape over the flash. The camera functioned much better in concert situations with this little improvement. However, I never found my makeshift solution acceptable. A fast shutter speed (which is sluggish even at its best) in low light should definitely be an option on this particular camera but it is not.Recomended for: People who need a compact, durable, easy-to-use camera mostly in outdoor situations (where it excels) or indoor situations where a flash is acceptable. A good camera for a family.NOT recomended for: Anyone who wants to be able to take detailed photos of far-away objects or in dark conditions, or anyone who wants to be able to closely control their camera's settings.

I've had mine for 4 years now, it's still alive and just a few weeks ago the tab that holds the battery inside broke. I've used this camera a LOT so it's been pretty worn out and in 4 years has never given me any problems. The pictures quality is pretty good considering its 4MP, the video feature is O.K., the sound is good, but you can't use the zoom option when using the video. You can also use it as a voice recorder although I never really used that feature as much. The batteries will last for at least 2-3 days taking pictures constantly. What really does wear out the battery quickly is the video feature, and using the Night Scene. The scenes that it has aren't that great bc most pictures come out blurry unless the camera is in a steady place. You can adjust the lens to a macro option, but you have to measure the distance well bc the picture might turn out blurry but after a few tries you get the hang of it and can take pretty great macro pictures.Overall I loved the camera.

The picture quality is horrible- every shot is blurry unless you are outside under optimal lighting conditions and you are in possession of a four leaf clover. The internal memory is horrible. The only reason I hung onto it for as long as I did is because I am a poor college student and tuition usually takes priority over everything else.The final straw was when I took it to Japan over the summer and ended up missing out on lots of great shots because of all the shortcomings this camera is saddled with.
