{"Reviews": [{"Title": "RUN!!! Don't walk from this company.", "Author": "Mr Music", "ReviewID": "R2PUPKB6SXBRK5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I strongly encourage anyone who is considering buying products from this company to look elsewhere.  There are many good companies that will stand behind their product but this isn't one of them.PROBLEMS WITH THE PRODUCT:1.) Difficult to setup and operate, not for novice users.  Non-Techie users will only be able to use very limited features on this unit.  Setting up the unit and viewing recorded content are not very user friendly.2.) Reduced features from similar and cheaper products.  Saw much better features out of a much much cheaper night owl unit.  Such as the ability to create motion sensitive zones that trigger motion detection.3.)Product will not function normally with a monitor connected to it, have to use lower RCA output to view multiple cameras at once or use the scrolling cameras mode.4.) Cheaply manufactured.  Lasted about 15 to 16 months.5.) HIGH cost of ownership.  Based on the time mine lasted, the cost of ownership is about $20 a month to own.  I believe that ADT video monitoring plans run about $30 a month and that is with better equipment and a staff of people to monitor it.  Not to mention the cheaper alternatives to ADT.PROBLEMS WITH THE COMPANY:1.) Won't stand behind their product.2.) Try to shift the blame to customer and/or environmental issues (see below.  Rep actually tried to blame the product going bad on the quality of power coming out of my outlet)3.)  Company does not pay for shipping to the warehouse for warranty issues.4.)  Company does not release firmware upgrades to the public.  Must go through tech support to perform upgrades.5.)  Money hungry.  Only after trying to sale you something else.FULL STORYI purchased a Camera DVR system from them in late January for my father, as a retirement gift.  I received the DVR in February and installed it a few weeks later.  In late May early June of the following year (about 15 months after I first installed the product) my father told me the device had stopped working.  It was about another month before I was able to get over to his house to take a look at it.  Out of the five cameras that were connected 2 were no longer working at all and the other 3 had lost their vertical hold.  I tried various things to get it working but the problem remained unchanged.I took the system and contacted Zmodo a couple of weeks later.  I worked with Mitch (the tech support guy) to confirm the problem was not the cameras and was indeed a failure of the product.  I asked for a one time out of warranty replacement, since the product was only in use for just a few months beyond the warranty.  He told me that was unlikely but he would ask his manager.  His manager declined to do a replacement and I asked to be transferred over to her to discuss it.  Amanda (his manager) answered.  She discussed the issue with me.  We went over at length about the space around the DVR and the power coming into the unit.  She even went as far to blame the incoming power on the failure of the unit, saying that plugging the DVR and the cameras into the same power outlet would cause the DVR to fail sooner.  I guess they suggest you run an extension cord from another room to power to cameras.  She confirmed again her decision that the company would not consider doing a one time out of warranty replacement, and at max could only extend the warranty 30 days in special circumstances.  I asked to speak to her manager which she informed me was the Director of the company (no one higher but the owner, which you can't talk to).  Went through everything again with Jeremy, the Director.  To make a long conversation short, he was unwilling to budge.  I offered to pay for the shipping if he would cover the labor and the part, he told me that I would have had to pay for the shipping if it were under warranty.  He told me that he couldn't possibly replace the item, because he then would have to do it for everyone.  I guess they have a lot of items fail just after warranty.  He was nice enough to direct me to their out of warranty repair service, which by the time I paid for shipping and repair, would be just shy of buying a new DVR without the hard drive.  Which would of course probably only last a year.As I said in the beginning, RUN!!!  This company is not interested in standing behind their product.  They are only interested in selling you something else.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$259.30", "Features": "8 Channel H.264 Real Time Surveillance Security 8CH DVR\nH.264 Hardware Compression\n1TB HD Installed and Configured\nSupport SATA HD up to 2TB\nVideo Input / Output: BNC 8/BNC 2", "Name": "ZMODO DVV DVR-H9108UV-1TB 8-Channel H.264 Real Time Surveillance Security 3G Mobile Remote Network", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21q5T9xhQUL.jpg", "ProductID": "B004BR3U6O"}}
