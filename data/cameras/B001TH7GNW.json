{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So much more than meets the eye.", "Author": "M. Jewell", "ReviewID": "R4RN5A3ZE4OI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I eyed this camera for a long time before buying.  I always had SLRs before but lately only owned super zoom point and shoots.  (5 M pix).  I wanted a little better resolution and a lot more flexibility and ability to control what the camera does as well as quickness, and smarts.  This one has it all.  Now after having gotten used to it, I love everything about it.  For example, it has several different \"themes\" for the display and you can set the \"Vari-program\" modes to look different than the \"P, S, A and M\" modes so you can see at a glance if you're in \"point and shoot\" or \"think about it\" modes.  The \"Quick-Set\" menu button makes it super fast to set the most commonly changed settings.  I love the way you can set ISO to be \"Auto\" in the \"P, S, A and M\" modes but set a minimum shutter speed and max ISO and it will ramp up the ISO within those limits.  So it keeps ISO set at 100 until correct exposure would require a speed slower than your min shutter speed setting and only then starts ramping up the ISO.  Really smart.  And it has a real \"Time\" function like the old SLRs had.  You have to buy the little remote but it's cheap, works fantastically and goes in a tiny case that goes on the camera strap so it's always with you.  That replaces the old locking cable release you had to have to do time exposures.  So you can take long exposures and from my initial tests in light polluted skys, it's going to take great starfield and milky way shots (with the fast lens I also bought.  See separate review of the 50mm f/1.4G).  And I love the exposure/focus lock button that can be set to do either or both (five different settings).  And having good, precise manual focus at a touch of the focus ring is such a refreshing change from the point-and-shoots.  The \"delete\" button is super fast to delete any shot.  Just push it twice.  I also love the rapid fire mode where it shows you how many shots are left in the buffer in viewfinder.  So when you fire off four rapid shots of that little soccer player about to score, you don't have to wait for all four to store, you can see as it progresses that you can take one, two, three and finally four rapid shots again to plan ahead.  And in that same situation, using the \"sports\" mode, it automatically sets focus to \"continuous\" which I normally don't use and stresses high shutter speeds.  (Another place where it's nice to have a fast lens.)Speaking of that, I've hardly used the 18-55 VR zoom that came with the kit.  I've read that it's a very nice lens but have no experience yet since I LOVE the 50mm f/1.4G I got.  I could go on and on.

One of the nice things I found when I started using this digital camera was that I could go manual and set shutter speed or aperture the way I had with the 35's.I've had the D60 now for 6 months and have taken over 3,000 photos.  Out of those I've had very few that were bad.The 18-55mm lens in the kit is a fine lens.  You will out grow in time, but it is very usable to the new d60 owner.I will have to say that there are so many setting on the d60 that you can change, I had to pickup and extra book to figure them all out. I would recomend buying this book to help with all the things your new d60 can do.

Vu", "ReviewID": "R2DQ34KYFQXJOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this camera right before our honeymoon in the Caribbean... We had 2 other decent point-and-shoot cameras but decided to buy this D60 Gold SE for our special, \"one-of-a-lifetime\" trip anyway. It turned out one of the best decisions ever 'cause nobody wanted to miss shooting photos of those gorgeous beaches and landscapes and everything else in the Caribbean! Our photos look really nice with sharp detail, beautifull color shades, and well-balanced exposures. While I used its manual settings as I've used to with my other SLR Nikon (35mm film), my wife could use its auto program features as she does with her tiny P&S; Canon. It's great to work with for both of us...A short note: I just bought a Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control and it worked perfectly right out of the box.

Seriously I am in Jamaica and live in Jamaica and when i say \"Di Ting Madddd!!!\" i mean 'eeet sell offf'  I am in no quarrel about the Gold Edition whether or not gold is in it i love it. As a photographer and teacher i realize that quality is in demand and the D 60 has proven to be handy reliable and portable with its ease of use and access there is freedom in feeling when i take it up and use it . Though i dropped it and had to buy the new Nikon D90, i miss it some what but i got it fixed and the difference is far from felt. two great pieces of equipment and of the two the D60 is lighter  thus i travel with it more than the D90 which is a bit more weighty but both cameras have their own uncomparable qualities.The D60 has what i call 'supa' endurance maybe its because i have extension battery packs on both cameras (D60 & D90) but i don't complain and wont complain. I recommend this camera for the enthusiast and hope that you not only commit to its loyalty but indulge your creativity try something new with it every day and become an explorer with the equipment... its worth nothing being just ordinary ... use your creative thoughts and revolutionize what you can do with the camera's ability to record your image.love it ...Jon Saleen Oliphant4U2C Creative Arts and Photography, (R)Creative Equilibrium (R)Creative Artist, Photographer & Art Teacher.Mandeville, Jamaica.Love and Respect.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "MY FIRST CAMERA", "Author": "Yudelka Rosario", "ReviewID": "R1JCINCL1AMUZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE THE COLORS!

Dedominick", "ReviewID": "RA9IIRKSWAOFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We love this camera. Although not full fledged \"photographers\", the camera makes it simple for the Point-and-Shoot fans. With the birth of our first child we wanted to be able to take consecutive shots without missing a smile, grin or sneeze. With the quick startup time and 3 frames a second we don't miss a thing now.We compared against the Nikon D40 model and decided to go with the extra megapixels...just in case. The lens gives a comfortable zoom level to easily take shots from across the room. Granted when he gets mobile and out on a sports field we may look at adding a longer Zoom, but the Vibration Reduction Lens that comes standard is more then enough for now.Red-Eye was an issue with our previous camera and even though the D60 has retouching options built in to fix pictures, we have not used them as the camera compensates the flash and we have yet to see a picture with red-eye yet.Battery life is great. We are still running off the original charge for almost a month and approx 500 pictures.As for Cons - We really do not see anything specific. There has been an occassion where there was a delay after taking multiple shots in quick succession that the camera hesitated as it wrote data. We combined this purchase with a SanDisk Extreme IV memory card for the fastest write speed we could get. We have not located and specs on memory buffers in any of the cameras we looked at, but the more technical folks may know what to look for.

If you have the $$$ you can get the D60 but if you want more bangs for the bucks go with the cheaper D40 and use the left over money to get a spare lens or whatever.Overall, i am very happy with it, picture transfer is pretty slow when  use the Camera direct to PC via USB, if you have a memory card reader use it.Sorry Guys, not a technical person like the other pro shooters. so that's my review....", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Mr. Jones", "Author": "Don Jones Construction", "ReviewID": "R73VO8J7TTUT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Buy and Great Camera.Shipping was right on time and the product was exactly as stated on Amazon", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "excelente", "Author": "luis arias", "ReviewID": "R206ACMQAWS31K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Estoy feliz con mi NIKON D60 ha sido muy buena eleccion ,llena mis expectativas de fotografo aficionado .
