The last time I went to Las Vegas I took a Sony camera and was very disappointed with all of the blurry pictures I ended up with. It was a total waste of time even taking the pictures. With this new Kodak ZD710 I had 1 blurry picture out of over 350 total. I am very pleased with the color, lighting and very sharp images. I had no trouble with the lens cap like the previous review stated. The cool thing is the camera automatically kicks off the lens cap when you turn the camera on. You will never take a picture by accident with the lens cap on again. Overall, its is a great camera. Great color, lighting and the biggest for me only on blurry picture. That picture was taken as a test while traveling 40 miles an hour down the strip.

I can't speak for the repair service of how well it holds up in the long run.  I've been quite happy with it so far.Pros:- incredible 10x optical zoom.  Listed as 38mm-380mm, although it was hard to see a difference compared to my 300mm \"real\" lens (which is plenty).- very lightweight- lots of settings offering lots of control, including a very nearly manual option.- marvelous panoramic stitch function- image stabilization- good (short) shutter lag time- two AAs keep it lightweight and make it easy to find batteries when yo need them (works best with rechargeable NiMHs, of course).- Plays directly to TV very easily- easy to process and transfer image filesCons:- slow to process.  It will take a picture when you click the button (no lag there), but AFTER the shot it takes time to save the file.- lightweight construction at the expense of sturdiness- turning it on, even to review photos, opens the lens, pushes off the lens cap, and opens the flash.- lens cap sometimes comes loose.- SLR shape and point-and-shoot size make it a little awkward to find the right carry case.Other:- it's tiny compared to a real SLR - should really compare to a point-and-shoot", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "1st hand observations", "Author": "Dennis Maeder \"DLM\"", "ReviewID": "R338Z77T1Y512D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few personal observations:Switch it on and the (tethered) lens cap flies off and the flash pops up!Quite impressive unless you want to be unobtrusive. Just manually remove lens cap and open flash.Great being able to toggle to EVF for demanding lighting situations.And with the nothing-left-of-the-lens design my nose doesn't get in the way and smear up the back of the camera.The neck strap hooks on both sides of the camera and is great for composing and stabilizing shots using the external display.Nice flat base means you can put it on a table for an autotimer shot of the group with you in it.Video is impressive. At full res (640x480) about 5min/GB.Overall picture quality is pretty good.The zoom rocker (on the camera back) falls well to the thumb, leaving the index finger free for the shutter release. The joystick control for menu navigation and review was not what I anticipated, but works well.I wish that rechargeable batteries had been supplied - camera takes AA x2 or equivalent.Overall, a pretty good camera for someone who wants a compact but not tiny camera with awesome optics, but who is way too cheap for a DSLR.", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "wenhether", "ReviewID": "R15XO3WW35KILH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I added this camera to my christmas list after reading reviews online. This is our second Kodak Easy Share that we have owned and both have been great cameras.Lots of options for you on this camera and the zoom is incredible!!The only one holding me back from giving it 5 stars is the lag time between taking pictures.

Great focusing abilities. The lag time after capturing the shot is a little annoying, but I typically do not need to take pics right after each other too frequently.The cameras design gives the subject a good feeling that your picture is going to turn out well.I found that the best case for my needs for this camera is actually the lowepro telephoto lens case Lowepro Lens Case 1 (Black)The fit is very snug, but not too snug. It also eliminates the need for the lens cap. There is room at the top to hold an extra two re-chargable batteries. I attached a Nikon lanyard instead of the included neck strap in case I drop it while taking pics, as I am a klutz. The lanyard also makes the camera more transport friendly when it's in the case. Other cases did not fit into my roller laptop bag properly.This camera works really well when coupled with a Pedco UltraPod II Lightweight Camera Tripod I am able to take some really nice shots of the moon using the manual settings, (you can even zoom in and see the craters in detail). Also the tripod can allow the camera to capture images in lower light conditions and makes for some great self portraits with or without other subjects.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Easy to use, fair price", "Author": "EMTP EJ \"EJ\"", "ReviewID": "R3LO11HMV15KE0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera because I wanted one that I thought would have good advanced features for me to use and yet be easy enough for my spouse to use and share the photos. There is a time lag between shots, unless you set it for 'burst' mode -- there is a button for that on top. There can also be a lag between button-push and capture if you are not in action mode. For accessories, I recommend at least a 2 GB SD card and some high-capacity batteries that are 2200 or 2500 mAh rechargeable, otherwise it really runs through alkaline batteries. I also wanted a camera that would use regular batteries, because I hate having to get batteries that are customized. We got an Energizer AA rapid charger with car and wall plugs and a spare set and never had a problem with running out of power or memory. You can also use this camera to take video.

This one so far has been dropped in the snow and on concrete and still works and look like the day I bought it. Its light weight but can take a fall. the worst that happens when falls the lens cap comes off, simple fix.If you buy the speical battery and not just use the double A, it will last forever.

It still works great, takes wonderful pictures, and I love it. This is a great camera for anyone who wants to get into taking photos but isn't sure if they are ready yet to drop the serious cash you need to when you buy a \"real\" professional camera.The drawbacks: My lens cap doesn't stay on very well. It's hard to find accessories. Zoom doesn't get you quite close enough to take really close up shots and as I mentioned above, accessories (such as lenses) are hard to find. When you do find them, they are way too expensive to purchase for a camera that wasn't very expensive. It's not worth buying lenses and such for this camera.

The ZD710 offers digital image stabilization, which prevent blurs due to camera shake. For framing images, the Kodak ZD710 has a 2.0\" 150K pixel LCD display as well as a higher resolution 201K pixel electronic viewfinder. Images are stored on SDHC/SD/MMC memory cards, or in 32MB of internal memory.The Kodak ZD710 has 16 scene modes to help beginners achieve the results they're looking for without the need to understand subtleties like shutter speeds, apertures and the like. Scene modes provided are: portrait, sports, landscape, candlelight, night portrait, night landscape, snow, beach, text, fireworks, flower, manner/museum, self-portrait, children, backlight and sunset. But the ZD710 offers additional exposure modes sure to please the enthusiast, including P (program), A (aperture priority), S (shutter priority), M (manual), smart scene, high ISO, digital image stabilization and panorama. The ZD710 determines exposures with a TTL metering system offering multi-pattern, center-weighted and spot modes, and offers 2.0EV of exposure compensation in 1/3EV increments. Five white balance settings are available including an auto mode, and ISO sensitivity can be set to Auto, 80, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1,600, all at full resolution. The EasyShare ZD710 also offers a movie mode, capturing VGA (640x480) or QVGA (320x240) clips at 30 fps, both with audio. Movies are encoded in QuickTime Motion-JPEG format.Images and movies captured on the Kodak ZD710 are transferred to your computer over a USB 2.0 Full Speed connection, rather slower than the USB 2.0 High Speed connections offered on many cameras these days. Power comes from two AA batteries (NiMH, lithium, or oxy-alkaline), a CRV3 disposable lithium, or an optional KODAK KAA2HR NiMH rechargeable battery pack. The ZD710 ships with a disposable lithium battery.", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Short battery life with Kodak NiMH rechargables", "Author": "cattledogit", "ReviewID": "RSJG6UHM84WCX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Kodak NiMH rechargeable batteries (1.2V) don't last long in this camera. They take just a few pics before the camera shows low battery even though a simple battery tester will show them as still fully charged. Likely disposable alkaline or lithium batteries will work better but alkalines at least won't last long, creating a lot of waste.An alternative is PowerGenix NiZn rechargeable batteries (1.6V) PowerGenix ZR-PGX5HRAA-4B, 3-5-Hour Fast Charger with 4 AA 1.6v High Voltage Rechargeable Batteries (Green). They're reported to work well in an unidentified EasyShare camera model in a review called \"PowerGenix batteries - TOOLS YOU CAN USE\" at thebdr.net. Amazon customer reviews of these batteries suggest their life may sometimes be limited to tens of recharge cycles so it may be better to use the 3-5 hour charger rather than the 1 hour charger since the life of some batteries is shortened when they're recharged in 1 hour. The hydrogen venting of these batteries discussed in the Amazon customer reviews means they shouldn't be kept in a tightly sealed container.The PowerGenix batteries worked initially without damaging the electronics of our ZD710 and they've performed well for us so far.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "haazegirl \"Anna\"", "ReviewID": "R2U6929SQZ0QDY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this on \"Black Friday\" 2007 and it is a good camera. I'm now selling it because of a few things. The first being personal, although I don't mind the size, I found that I take less pictures because of it's larger body. Second because of the shorter battery life, and third being the lag time. That stuff is in all of the other reviews.  Now that I read these other reviews and see that it's holding it's price I almost want to keep it. The optical stuff is great and it does take awesome crisp pictures! It shows almost no signs of wear and tear after 2 years. The body is very lightweight, but it is sturdy. And yes the lens cap comes off all the time, so what. I found a case that fits the camera and extra batteries perfectly. Samsonite is the name on it it is square-ish in shape and has zipper closure with velcro. They were seen at Wal-marts everywhere! Not hard to find. The display looks a little grainy, but I assure you that the pictures come out fabulous!To comment on some other reviewer's problems with the LCD screen turning off. I had this problem only when batteries were almost dead. And for a while I thought it was broken for good. However I was smart enough to find a little button after putting in new batteries that turned it back on and I have never had a problem since. I assume that I pushed the button by accident while taking a picture, very frustrating, but easily solved.

Yes, the time between pics is long, but the autofocus is better than any other camera I have tried so at least the pic will be crystal clear.  The Nikons are fast, but every pic was blurry.  So it is worth the wait!As for the battery life - there is an easy way to solve that.  Buy digital camera batteries instead of regular alkaline.  They are like $4 each on Amazon ($8 at Target), but they last for like 4 months and I take a million pics with 4 kids and being an avid scrapbooker.I love how the lens pops up and the lens cap pops off.  makes for grabbing your camera and catching a photo of your little one super fast.  Hated the Nikon when the lens cap was on and you would go to turn it on and then you would have to turn the camera back off, take the cap off and then turn it back off.

For my wife, we needed a camera that was point and shoot.Battery life?  Fuggetaboutit.  The rechargeables at the beginning lasted only for about 100-150 photos, less if you were shooting a lot at a time and leaving it on.  As the camera got older, the alleged battery life got shorter and shorter.  The camera was always saying the batteries were dead.  When I finally figured this out (after a vacation when it was letting me shoot only a dozen or so photos before turning off), the batteries weren't even dead.  I'm sure I spent as much on batteries during the life of the camera as I did on the camera, not realizing that I've thrown away dozens of good batteries.
