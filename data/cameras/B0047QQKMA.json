I purchased a DVR776 camera pen. The product did not work from the get go. I paid approximately $180 for the pen and shipping. I tried charging it with the usb/wall adapter, no luck. I plugged it into the computer and folders of nothing would pop up. No lights would turn on on the pen when charging it, resetting it, attempting to film, etc.Furthermore, upon receiving the product, there was no manual provided.  When attempting to find information on the purchased product, it was nearly impossible.  The box it came in had nothing printed on it pertaining to the product name, manufacturer name, contact information, etc.  It simply only stated said tasks the product was capable of doing.  Very shady if you ask me...maybe a knock-off product.I called the tech support number provided by the vendor after emailing them 1-800-590-4272 option 2. The lady on the phone was rude, ignorant and defensive.They can have their crappy product back. I am cancelling the transaction with PayPal.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0047QQKMA"}}
