The rest were great, even zoomed out to a ridiculously large size on my computer, with crisp lines and faces, and vivid colors, far exceeding any 35 mm or digital camera I have used in the past.The camera itself and the software included with it are incredibly intuitive.  Though there are many manual settings possible, I set the camera in Auto mode and just clicked away.  Many places I took pictures required me to turn off the flash, but even those were very clear and bright, and I had to do nothing but aim and shoot.The delay time between pictures was negligible, and the rechargeable AA batteries I used were good for around 200 pictures a charge, even using flash and with frequent zooming in and out.  I used a 16 GB SDHC chip and had the capacity to take 5,000 pictures!  I'm still working on filling the first chip!!The provided software is also very simple to use...as easy as plugging in the provided USB cable, and turning the camera on.  All pictures are quickly and automatically saved in folders by date regardless of how many times in a day you download them, and renaming or tagging pictures is a breeze.  I have not even begun making full use of the picture touch-up features, but the software includes a fun and easy slideshow application that makes sharing pictures via desktop or projector a snap.Overall, I could not be happier that I purchased this camera!  I look forward to mastering all its features, but as a user-friendly, versatile, and inexpensive point-and-click camera, it blew away all my expectations.  It does all that Canon says it does and makes taking pictures fun and easy, right out of the box!", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best camera is the one you have when you need it...", "Author": "Kyung Fizaine \"KF\"", "ReviewID": "R14ZMKDLK918BA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm an experienced photographer already equipped with DSLRs (EOS 30D, EOS 5D MKII), but these are not always pratical when you are travelling or biking (I do both on a regular basis). I try to take my DSLRs as often as possible with me but but there are occasions when I don't want to be bothered by the bulky cameras. At the same time, having already invested significantly in DSLR equipment, I wanted to limit my investment. A G10 or G11 would have been nice but for what I wanted to do, it would have been an overshoot. I'm mainly using my A1100is for candid pictures or pictures of places I know I will be coming back with my DSLRs later. Overall, I'm happy about quality of the pictures. I rarely use the full resolution, I typically shoot with medium resolution as I will rarely print large pictures (I have my DSLRs for that).What I like:- price- size- optical viewfinder (not many point and shoot cameras at this price range still has an optical viewfinder)- slow shutter speed flash mode- ISWhat I'm missing:- no aperture priority mode where I can choose a precise f-stop- wish would have a wider angleI would definitely recommend this for people on low budget but still wants good quality pictures.

While other reviews indicate that it performs poorly in low-light conditions, thus far I haven't had that problem. All of the pictures that I have taken to date have been clear and crisp.  There are times when the video viewfinder may appear grainy in low light when attempting to take a picture, however the pictures actually taken are not grainy at all.  It is very user friendly, and the motion detection, face recognition, and image stabilization add vast improvements over earlier models. It is small and slim even though it takes AA batteries.

I'm quite pleased, the pictures are great.  The ASA 1600 setting in Program mode allows quite decent shots indoors with no flash, which in museums and many other locations is essential.  I bought it mainly because of good experiences with older Powershot models, and because I insist on being able to get batteries anywhere although I use rechargeable NIMH AAs normally.  The NIMHs last a really long time.  The image stabilization really helped with shots of static subjects with the camera zoomed way in.  The viewfinder is extremely helpful outdoors in the sun.

I wanted the same kind of memory as I had in the Kodaks and a low price. I also wanted a camera that took regular or rechargeable batteries. Some of the other batteries are just too expensive. I also really wanted an optical view finder in addition to the display screen. Not many cameras provide this any more unless you go high end. I would have gone with Kodak again if they had one with an optical view finder, then I wouldn't have had to learn new upload software. The main selling point for me was that the Canon had an optical view finder. I have been happy with this camera, it only cost $130 on amazon.com. It is not that different than the kodaks I have had and easy to use. It has alot of features I probably won't use, I am basically a point and shoot photographer.

I have an Elph that I love because it fits in a shirt or pants pocket.  She likes the A1100IS because it has a big LCD screen and it takes AA batteries.  She uses rechargables, but I also like the AAs because if my camera battery dies and hers also die, we can get AAs anywhere in a pinch and have at least one camera going.My mother also has this camera and she likes the feel of the camera.  The same battery compartment that makes this model bigger than the Elph is a plus in her mind because it gives her something solid to wrap her fingers around.Anyway, other reviews are more in depth, but I have to say one thing about the reviews that say the pictures are out of focus.  This is going to sound stupid, but I had the same reaction when we took a few pictures on Christmas morning.  I reviewed them on the LCD screen and they were horrible.  I thought I got a lemon and was very disappointed.  Then I realized there was a nearly invisible plastic protective sheet over the LCD.  When I peeled that off, everything was perfect.That may not be what happened to the others who complained about fuzzy photos, but I just wanted to make this clear (no pun intended) because I almost made a big mistake.  So FYI: Unlike similar protective sheets I've seen on a hundred different products (I even leave them on my cell phones and such until they peel themselves off), on this camera that sheet is not clear, it makes everything look out of focus and it was hard to detect.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Broke after 3 months", "Author": "seashell", "ReviewID": "R2M90Y5VSMH4WO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in August and used it to take photos of my son's wedding.

We are talking only 2 megapixels here. So I got the A1100 IS with 12.1 megapixels and expected to be BLOWN AWAY. What I got, especially for landscapes, looked like very bad polaroids from the 1970s. Bad colors and unfocused. You Gotta Be Kidding Me. Canon's email help sent me the steps to reset the camera defaults. I did that but to no avail. Next step: their toll free phone service ... after talking with a very helpful service rep he realized I wasn't a total dilettante and advised me to return the item.So I brought it back to the location of purchase and invited all the sales reps to see for themselves. They decided it was the camera and not an inept customer. They even pulled another A1100 IS off of their shelf and tried that with the same results. I received a full refund, but was very disappointed because, after all, I wanted a camera!I believe that a bad lot must have rolled off the Canon production line. What else could explain such low quality? Certainly the prototypes could not have been this pathetic. The more positive customer reviews indicate that some good batches shipped out.

My main concern is the quality of the pictures not all the whizbang features.The camera is very easy to operate and the size makes it an every day carrier in my pants pocket. The \"on\" response was good and the shutter lag was acceptable. Lots of shooting modes (which most people will never understand much less use).My two main complaints:1. The very soft pictures. My old A560 shoots beautifully sharp images in just about any situation. The 1100 just doesn't produce the quality shot I'm used to. I have a high end Canon digital SLR and the 560's shots approach the quality of it's big brother. The 1100 falls way short of the kind of quality I'm used to.2. The camera needs to be held at an angle away from my face to be able to review the shots taken. When viewed straight on the images are very blurry and dim.I'm no technical expert so my review is amateurish and far from complete. As I said earlier my main concern is the quality of the image and the 1100 falls short.I returned the camera to Amazon for a refund and will try to locate another 560 to buy.By the way, unless there is a gross difference in price on any item you wish to purchase, Amazon is the place to buy.

Callaway", "ReviewID": "R13550IV5ADUB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before getting into details, I am very pleased with this camera for many reasons and have recommended it to other people. In general, it is a good, inexpensive small camera that one can carry in a pocket or purse and takes good pictures for a camera of this price range. It has many options and seems to work well in low-light situations if you have a steady hand.My wife and I have dSLRs, but I organize a motorcycle group and you just can't use a full sized camera while riding a bike. I have used other small POS (point and shoot) cameras in the past, and this is the best of the lot so far.The camera takes good pictures. Nothing spectacular, but better than my older POS cameras and not as good as my dSLRs. I wouldn't use it to shoot a wedding, but I might keep it in my pocket at one so I can catch something that can't be missed while fumbling with lenses or something else on my 'real' camera.I can also use the camera with gloves on, except for the display button. It's easy to find in my pocket, turn on, hold, and shoot all with gloves. No .. I don't adjust the camera while riding, but I can switch it from picture to movie mode by touch (there is a 'gap' in the clicks between the two modes). The field of view is wide enough that I can 'shoot blind', that is point the camera behind me and take a picture without looking at the display. Yes .. I delete lots of pictures.Some of the reviews talk about not being able to set ISO.  This is incorrect, if you put the camera in program mode and press the function key, you can set the ISO.  For most of these types cameras, anything above 200 ISO starts to get very grainy, so I resist the temptation to set the ISO way up in low light situations.  I have gotten very good quality pictures at 1/40th of a second exposures, although I had to use the same technique target shooters use .. squeeze the trigger and hold. If you do a quick 'click and release' of the shutter, there will be a lot of motion blur. Better to gently press the shutter and hold until the camera takes the picture.It is also very easy to turn off the display ... simply keep pressing the display button until it turns off.  I leave the display on as the camera has the ability to draw guide lines at 1/3 intervals on the camera. Where these lines intersect are places to put areas of interest in your photo.  Look at many great photos and you will notice that the person or object isn't in the center, it's off to one side and maybe high or low.Anyone who wants to take great pictures will find themselves using software, even the great film artists used the darkroom to achieve the 'vision' they wanted. Cropping, dodging, burning, altering the contrast and brightness, are all tools that any photographer should learn when and when not to use.  The program that comes with the camera is adequate, but I would recommend anyone that fancies themselves as a photographer to spend another $100 and purchase 'real' editing software, such as Adobe's Photoshop Elements or Corel's Paint Shop product.  These tools allow for more control over the final picture, but don't cost hundreds of dollars like the Photoshop CS line and do not have a steep learning curve.The camera is a bit bulky, but I choose it over slimmer models because it uses AA batteries. There is nothing more frustrating than to get somewhere and have your sleek battery pack run out of juice. At least with AA, you can buy more at just about any store or gas station.  I would recommend purchasing lithium batteries, regular batteries will get used up quickly. As one reviewer noted, rechargeable batteries are also a great option, although I would make sure I always had a spare, fully charged set with me.Two negative comments. First, the flash is useless. If you are close enough, things get all blown out.  Too far back and things are not bright enough. The 'acceptable' distance is very narrow, and the edges get too dark. About the only acceptable way I have gotten pictures with the flash is to use the old 'Kleenex' trick -- drape one or two layers of tissue paper over the flash to dull the light a little bit and then crop out the dark edges.  Secondly, it is very easy to accidentally change the camera settings. I find myself constantly checking to make sure it is still in 'program' or 'movie' mode. (I tend not to use the scene modes, but adjust the exposure and white balance myself.)", "Date": "January 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for general use", "Author": "Mark Mc", "ReviewID": "R20KF5WGOYS7RV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was an Olympus Camedia with a 10X optical zoom.  It was a great camera, but it was nearly impossible to carry around in case I wanted to get a shot of something or other.  That's simply not a problem with the Canon A1100IS.  It'll fit just about anywhere you might carry a wallet.  Additionally, the construction is robust enough that I don't think you have to worry about crushing it unless you sit directly on it.Ease of use is completely fine.  Some of the icons on the various buttons take a little getting used to, but that's really not a problem. Maybe most important for people like me with very large hands and fingers, the camera is still quite easy to operate. As far as picture quality goes, it's more than fine.

So when I decided to get the Beautiful Wife ( BW ) a new camera for Christmas, it was a Canon\u00ae, no argument. She's a make it easy, no figuring stuff out, point and shoot kind of person who just wants to take some nice photos of family, the office gang, and be able to slip a camera into that travel trunk called a purse for easy access. This little camera fits those requirements pretty darn well. It's small yet not too small that it feels overly delicate; the viewfinder is a big plus -- trust me: composing a shot in the viewfinder will force you to actually take some good photos and not just those arm's length snapshots; the controls are well-placed and simple to use - the \"Auto\" setting is fine for most folks until you decide to play around with the other modes ( which you SHOULD - be creative! ); the photo quality, so far, is excellent. 12 megapixels is, in my humble opinion, just fine for almost everyone. Unless you're shooting stuff for billboard-size enlargements, anything more is just overkill. The face detection setting works fairly well - it locked onto most faces pretty quickly, even in dim light. I only found three small cons so far: 1. Battery consumption is higher than I'd like - the BW drained a fully-charged set of AAs fairly quickly but admittedly there was a LOT of shooting during the Christmas melee. 2. The view screen is set almost flush with the camera's back and thus is easily scratched. A screen protector is really needed and Canon should include one as they're fairly cheap. 3. The included 128mb card is way too small unless you plan on shooting only at the lowest resolution which defeats the purpose of having all those pixels. Get a 4GB card - they're cheap also, and you won't get caught without card space when that opportunity of a great photo arises. That's nitpicking, I know, but that's just my view.  In all, I think Canon\u00ae has a winner here - nothing earth shaking, but a good quality camera that's not hard to use, is compact but not toylike, and takes some sharp and nicely lit photos even on the basic Auto setting.

I didn't want to spend a lot because I was also thinking about getting an SLR, so I decided to go with a low end Canon point and shoot to cover the gap before I jumped into SLR territory.  I got the A1100IS because it was at the \"top\" of the line of Canon's low end cameras and I have had very good experience with Canon products.Build quality seemed OK, but you can tell there is more plastic in this camera than in the Elph models I've owned.  I liked that the camera has a bulge grip as it is less likely to be dropped.  Form factor it is a little bit bigger than the Elph series, but that is to be expected.  I'm only giving it two stars because of the picture quality.  The camera did not focus well, or quickly for me.  Trying to snap pictures of our two small boys was very difficult.  The autofocus would lock onto other objects in the frame and the subjects would be blurry.  This was not obvious looking at the picture on the LCD screen, but once the picture got into the PC for viewing we were very disappointed about missing some shots.  My wife took pictures at the school's halloween parade, so mind you these are fairly slow moving kids in costumes, and only about half of them turned out to be in focus.I then took my son outside for an experiment.  I asked him to walk slowly at a diagonal into the camera's view and snapped several pictures using \"Easy\", \"Automatic\" and \"Kids & Pets\" settings.  Nearly all of them came out blurry.  The camera simply could not detect him in the picture and instead chose to focus on other, stationary objects.  I was actively trying to get that little green 'focus' box on him, but it just wouldn't cooperate.I sent it back to Amazon (first time I think I've used their return policy) and ordered a Canon SD1200IS for just a few extra bucks.  After some limited use appears to do a much better job, similiar to my older, deceased Canon.Also, I just ordered the Canon T1i through Amazon.

Edge Jr. \"Happy Traveler\"", "ReviewID": "R2URLEBSLT61BB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a worthy successor to the Consumer Reports top-rated Canon A1000IS which I favorably reviewed last year after buying one for my stepson just prior to his trip to Kenya but tested extensively myself ahead-of-time.  He brought back hundreds of stunning photographs.  This year I bought this newer model for my wife, but also tested it before giving it to her.  She is delighted with the small size, light weight, ease of use and great photos.All of the desirable features of this camera's predecessor were retained and refined, including an optical viewfinder that is missing on most other compact point-and-shoot cameras today.  Not only does constantly using the camera's LCD screen eat battery power unnecessarily, holding a camera at arm's length to see the screen can introduce unnecessary shake and blurred photos.  In bright sunlight LCD screens are nearly impossible to see.  However, the screen is necessary to properly frame extreme close-up shots, some of which I have uploaded to this camera's gallery.Although this camera can use off-the-shelf AA alkaline cells, the smarter option is to use high-capacity rechargeable NiMH batteries that can deliver longer life, shorter recycle times and pay for themselves quickly since they're reused and not discarded.  I recommend a rapid charger that can be used with both a 12-volt car socket or can be plugged into an AC outlet.  Amazon sells the Lenmar 2-Hour AA/AAA NiMH Charger Kit that will do that.  That way you can always have freshly-charged batteries at your disposal even if you're giving the camera heavy use.I normally use a single-lens-reflex digital camera, but I can favorably compare the images from this camera with those of my much heavier and bulkier SLR.  There is considerable merit to having a lightweight, compact camera that is easy to use and carry.  This camera meets those requirements nicely even though it doesn't offer the manual adjustments, low-light performance and zoom range of larger, heavier and much more expensive cameras.Built-in face-recognition technology and image stabilization in this camera have made it much more difficult to take bad people photos, even when there is strong back-lighting or other conditions that could normally sabotage your pictures.  I found the camera's automatic contrast management a real plus when taking photos in bright lighting conditions.  Although the SD memory card that comes with this camera is bigger than the one that was included with the A1000IS, most people will want to spring for a card with at least 4GB of capacity.  This camera will accept SDHC cards up to 8GB.  You should invest in one if you plan to shoot videos as well as still photos with this camera.In summary, this camera offers considerable value at any price less than $160.  It's compact, lightweight and simple to use yet, with some care composing your shots, takes high-quality photographs which you can proudly display and favorably compare with the best.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great pictures for such a low price", "Author": "Sir William Williams III \"Have Camera, Will T...", "ReviewID": "RV39M06ZD9UTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The pictures this little camera takes are excellent.

In a direct comparison to the A80 from 2004, I expected improved quality (12MP vs. 4MP), but that was not the case.  The A1100 produces larger images (and correspondingly much larger image files), which are quite inferior to the A80, and totally inferior to the 6MP DSLR Nikon D40. Obviously, real lenses make all the difference with a DSLR, but I was surprised that the A80 images were superior to the A1100.Part of the A1100's problem may be its internal image processing algorithms, its sensor, and/or the \"lens\".  The camera DOES have a wide set of features, with many user-adjustable settings and, with a fair amount of tweaking, one can produce some fairly good-looking images.  However in \"Auto\" or \"P\" (Program) modes, a high percentage of the photos I have taken so far (in a wide range of lighting conditions) appear washed out, excessively grainy, incorrectly exposed or focused, or otherwise inferior.  The much older A80 seems to have fewer of these issues.The A1100 does have a very fast start-up time, and is ready to record within a second or two (the lens still has to extend before you can shoot). However, flash recovery and/or image recording time can be annoyingly slow. This will vary depending on the complexity of the image, image resolution, file size, and battery state. I was quite surprised to find that flash recovery time in an outdoor, nighttime setting could be as high as 10-12 seconds.The range of shooting modes and manual adjustments means you CAN do some artistic photography, but the learning curve is somewhat steep on most of the features (less so if you are already familiar with photography, digital point-and-shoots, and Canon digital camera menu routines). And I would not depend on this unit for capturing consistently high quality images on significant occasions, unless you have spent a great deal of time mastering this camera and its multitude of settings, and shot a large number of test/learning images.It is important to me to have a optical viewfinder, which the A1100 has, but a user must be aware of its limitations. If exact framing and composition is required, the LCD screen must be used, which drains the batteries faster. This unit has relatively short battery life, but performs better with rechargeable NIMH's, at moderate temperatures (50-85 F), and with the LCD screen off. Since it only takes 2X AA's, carrying a couple of sets of back-up batteries is no problem. Some users have reported extremely short battery life, which may be a defect in their unit.  I would rate the A1100 \"average\" on battery use with alkaline or lithiums, and slightly above-average with rechargeable NIMH's.Bottom line: This is not an awful camera, and might be handy for casual snapshots, if the user takes the time to learn and master its capabilities.  The captured images often look better on the small LCD, but you will not know how good or bad they really are until viewed on a full-size computer monitor. I believe there are better point-and-shoot cameras available (several by Canon) which will produce more consistent and satisfactory results than the A1100.  But I'm not sorry I bought this one as an addition to my photographic toolkit. Its portability, fast start-up, and wide feature set make it handy for carrying around and recording vacation snaps or daily adventures.  Just don't depend on it for mission-critical photography.UPDATE 8/12/10: Just shot some outdoor photos about 45 minutes before twilight, with the camera set at 12MP (maximum) resolution, and ISO set to 1600. The grain is HIDEOUS and the photo quality completely unacceptable. Granted, one can expect increasing noise at higher ISOs, but this is terrible. For this limitation, I am downgrading my overall product rating by .75 stars.  I am reconsidering bringing this unit on my next vacation, preferring to rely on the much higher quality (at 1/3 the megapixels) Canon A80. I would recommend the A1100 for non-significant local use only.My (updated) rating: 2.5/5 (formerly 3.25)", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "My Canon Upgrade", "Author": "Pat in Phoenix \"Pat\"", "ReviewID": "RVY7CRO3SRPPP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Canon Powershot A1100 replaced an earlier Canon A540 for me. The earlier A540 was badly damaged in an accident. It has many similarities to the earlier Powershot which made the transition very easy. The longer-than-average 4x optical zoom was a good feature for me. And the digital zoom extends the reach for those situations like shooting wildlife where getting closer is not possible. I do not know the details of how the image stabilization works but it definitely helps on the zoomed images. I am able to make good usable images at 12x and 16x zooms that would have been blurs on the last camera. This made possible bird pictures on a recent trip that would otherwise have required a more-expensive camera with a 10x optical zoom. Note that if you want to control some of the factors in the way the camera takes the picture, such as ISO speed and focus options, you need to learn the P-program setting. I use it to up the ISO speed to 200 or 400 in low-light or shade situations to keep the shutter speed fast. The 2 main Auto modes take very good pictures as well.One note is that I'm still trying to check the battery life. It seems to use up a pair of AA batteries faster the previous camera. I use the rechargable AA batteries which are the best way to go unless you like throwing out alkalines. I've also started to use a new set of batteries so it adds another variable. It looks like I'm getting about 80 pictures per pair of 2600mah batteries. Which seems a little low. But sometimes the new batteries have to go thru about 5 discharge-recharge cycles to get to full strength.

Velasquez", "ReviewID": "R3M4JBAFETBGZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To quote a friend, \"The most important feature of a camera... is that you have it with you when you need it\".  That said, I bought this camera because I wanted to have something that would travel easy, inconspicuously, and not slow me up.  In this regard, the Canon PowerShot is everything I hoped for. I purchased this just before a week long trip to WA DC and used it the entire time (200+ photos) without ever feeling like it was a chore to get at or use.  One tap of the on/off button and the camera jumps to life and is ready to shoot in literally 1 second (no delays and/or waiting).  My previous digital camera (from another manufacturer) spent most of the time in my vehicle and didn't get a lot of use as it was bulkier and the Lithium-Ion batteries always seemed like they were dead and didn't last very long.  Another reason for acquiring this particular model camera was the fact that it takes (2) off the shelf AA batteries.  I picked up (4) NiMH rechargeables, with the added peace of mind that I can stop into most any store to acquire additional batteries should the need ever arise.  CAUTION - this camera does burn through batteries so be prepared.  I swapped out the NiMH batteries 3 times to take those 200+ pictures... and those batteries are supposed to last up to 3 times longer than their non rechargeable counter parts.  While I haven't tried it yet, shutting down the LCD and using the optic viewfinder would certainly help ameliorate this issue (another plus of this model).  Finally, the only funky things I noticed with this camera are: 1) Every once in a great while (perhaps 1 in 100 shots) it would be slow to acquire focus on an object.  Almost like it was confused and needed an extra 10 seconds or so before the LCD display turned from a blur to something distinguishable.  2) While in \"Auto\" mode (where it spends most of the time) the only flash options are \"Automatic\" and \"No Flash\".  The problem is that against bright backdrops the camera won't recognize the need for the flash to better illuminate the subject and you can't override to force a flash.  The problem is solvable, as in those instances, you'll just need to switch over to another of the pre-programmed shooting modes that does allow you to push a flash situation.  A minor nuisance, but something to be aware of.These truly minor nitpicks aside, I am very pleased with this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for a thoroughly well featured, portable, \"at-the-ready\" solution.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "Truth Seeker \"Learner\"", "ReviewID": "R27QNJ1YRUJGG1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We just took this camera on an extended trip abroad and were totally delighted with it.

It was very difficult to tell whether I had taken a good shot or not by looking at the picture on the camera's view screen.  Half the pictures I had taken of my kids were not good.  Had I been able to tell that while looking at the screen, I would have simply taken more shots.  It's a terrible view screen.-Poor battery life.  I put in brand new duracell batteries and got about 25 shots out of them. This is atrocious for a camera this small.  My guess is that the flash is a serious power hog and it is a very bright flash.  I recommend rechargeable batteries.  Don't bother with regular batteries.-Huge lag times between pictures.

When I got it a few years ago, it was the only remaining one (of this size) with a viewfinder I could find.  All other manufacturers fell in love with great big LCDs and Canon went the same way.  I didn't want an SLR-sized camera - I wanted one I could put in a very little case or directly in my pocket.  I am a skier and a sailor.  Try and use one of those LCD screens on the water on a sunny day or on a glacier skiing at 11,000 ft. and you will learn to hate the LCD and love the fact you can frame your picture with a viewfinder.  This is probably the last camera I will buy.  My wife has already given up her little Elph for her iPhone.  BTW, on buying it, I wrote to CNET, Canon, Samsung, and several other small camera manufacturers complaining over the loss of viewfinders and replacement with giant LCDs.  The few that responded touted how well their LCDs worked in the sun. (Not!) And they said loss of viewfinders was due to customer input requesting larger LCDs. (Don't believe this!) And thier tones implied to me that I should just get with the program and accept what they were offering.  (Most CNET responses were in this vein too,)  Anyway the Canon PowerShot A1100IS is a great little camera in my opinion. Oh, I guess i wish it had 12X zoom instead of 4X zoom.  12+ megapixels seems still to me in 2013 to be adequate for my needs.  Battery life with AA rechargeables is adequate; I keep a package of AA lithiums in the little case, just in case.

The batteries in my Nikon wouldn't need to be changed but once every few weeks if that, and I was using that camera nonstop at that time.For that reason, I give it 1 star... the only reason I upped it to 2 stars is because the picture quality IS truly great. I can't complain at all about the quality of the pictures or videos that I've taken. Normally that would out-weigh any other issue because I bought it FOR the quality of the pictures, but the battery life is so bad that I have to make sure I keep 3 and 4 sets of extra batteries for times where I MAY want to take a ton of pictures or long videos.

Most of the new 2010 model point and shoot cameras do not offer these features.I find it difficult to take pictures using a display because one has to hold the camera away in order to see the subject of the shot. For me, this generates shake. Using the optical view finder, one brings in ones arms to rest against the body, and the camera rests against the nose/face, giving much more stability.Also, one can pretty much forget about taking pictures on a real sunny day with just a display and no optical view finder. That has been my experiencePrevious reviews have mentioned that the optical view finder is inaccurate, which I have to agree with. What you see is not what you get. Once you figure out the directions in which it is inaccurate, you have to make that adjustment when focusing the shot. It becomes second nature after a while.Also, because I use the optical view finder, I turn off the display which greatly reduces the battery drain.The AA batteries are appealing because I do not want to be tied to a proprietary battery that needs to be charged and costs $40+ to replace. In my opinion, whether you use rechargeable AA's or throw-a-ways, AA's are much more practical.I have had the A1100 a month as of 5/8/10, have taken 200+ pictures and I am very happy with it.I'm thinking of buying a second one before they become unavailable, because the optical view finder and AA battery offerings are going to be very hard to find in the future. Just checked the price and it has gone up $10 since I purchased my A1100. :-(I rate the A110IS a \"4\" because I never rate anything a \"5\", the inaccurate optical view finder and the abbreviated user manual.

But, we upgraded for the following reasons:1.  The reviews were excellent from both amateurs and professionals both here and on other sites.2.  The AA battery is more convenient than carrying the older proprietary battery and charger from the 8MP model.  Since you need to bring AA or AAA batteries along when you travel, this is not an added item but rather replaces the older battery and wall charger.  This is expecially helpful when traveling abroad or for extended camping, hiking, or bike trips when you can change the AAs but not necessarily recharge via the wall charger.3.  The controls are more intuitive for my wife.  With the 8MP, it was easy to set the camera in the video mode after previewing pictures already taken.  Nothing more frustrating than wanting to see that special picture only to find that you had the camera in the video mode and had nothing to show.

The pictures already have natural skin tones and backgrounds are bright enough.Another crazy good thing - anyone who's tried taking pictures of small kids knows how much they jump around when you're trying to get that perfect candid shot...OR if there's 2 in the picture and 1 more says \"HEY ME TOO!\" and jumps in before you hit the button, this camera automatically UPDATES for this new kid/increase in the number of faces. SO the stress is gone! There's no need to rush everyone to get in the picture because it just KNOWS when a new face pops in. Even when my kids are moving and rearranging it adjusts for the perfect shot without my having to refocus.I don't see how you could come up with any more features at this price.

This Canon takes great photos and is fairly easy to use.  I'm impressed whith how it adjusts automatically to take fine handheld interior shots in dim cathedrals as well as perfect exposures at the beach. It offers far more resolution and features than will be needed by an amateur photographer.  I have dialed it back to a medium pixel setting and it is still incredibably sharp. I took it to Europe a few months after getting it and was rewarded with hundreds of outstanding pictures.  The option of taking pictures through the view finder is nice but in practice I doubt you will use it much as it doesn't give the exact framing of the image being shot.  Now for the down side.  I only get about 45 shots on a set of alkaline batteries.  Rechargables would be well worth investing in.  The battery door is a weak design and you should uses your finger carefuly to apply support and pressure when closing. No problems yet by being careful.  My camera cost only $140 on Amazon October 2010.  Don't know why they seem to have gone up since then.  The instruction book that came with it is pretty limited.  You have to download the disc on our computer to get full instructions.  A full printed instruction booklet would have been nice. After about a year it suddenly stopped downloading pictures to my computer after doing so many times.  The computer did not recognize the camera for some reason.  In fairness this may have been the fault of my computer. I never really resolved the issue of fault between the computer or camera.  But I got around the problem. I bought a $10 card reader and put the memory chip in it and it downloads the pictures to my computer without a hitch. A further word of caution; get into the habit of slipping on the wrist strap EVERY TIME you pick it up.

This Canon is quite adequate in regards to it having very short first and succeeding shot delays.'Regarding battery life.' Two AA batteries are not going to give you as many photo shots as rechargeable dedicated batteries. You should not have any problem as long as you are aware of this and keep spare batteries available. For longer battery life you can turn off the LCD display when you are in brighter areas and use the viewfinder We have been able to exceed well over one hundred shots even with the LCD display on one set of AAs. This included reviewing, erasing, and editing photos'Optical viewfinder.' In some of the reviews there was some complaints regarding the size and accuracy of the viewfinder. At least this camera has one. It is getting rare to find point and shoot digital cameras with one. It is a matter of squeezing in a larger LCD display with the more compact cameras with little or no room for a viewfinder. There are times I still like a viewfinder for quick shots.'The macro mode' This is excellent on this camera. I took some photos well within two inches of the subject with excellent results.'The owner's manual.' The supplied CD user guide is one of the better ones I have seen. I think it is well written, particulary for people that are less familiar with digital cameras. I would still suggest making a print out of the manual for convenience.

Although the Nikon was a great little camera and traveled the world without problems for a few years, it finally developed a 'smudge' inside the lense that couldn't be removed.  So I borrowed my nephew's A1000IS, and I was amazed.  The bullet points above are the distinct differences between the L4 (and the L20, I think) and the Canon.

Unfortunately, I hadn't checked the return policy of the third-party vendor, so I had to pay a restocking fee. Never again!

Yes, it told me how to install the memory card, the batteries, (which were not rechargeable AA batteries, very wasteful there), the wrist strap, and how to take photos in the AUTO and EASY modes, how to film a movie, and of course how to see what you'd photographed.

Also, I have found that in traveling, camping, hiking, it's always great to have a small, capable camera that is expendable.  If it can also provide qulaity photos, that's even better.  I've always preferred the color rendition and clarity of the Digic chip, and this camera simply does an excellent job.  Can I create a better photo with my 5D or 7D?  Sure, but I'll not throw either one of those in my briefcase or just tote them in my pocket on the Long Trail.  It's the \"camera I have with me,\" under these circumstances, and for that, it is a true winner.  It's a product of genuine quality and value, that perfectly pegs the market for which it is intended.I've owned three now and have destroyed two (after some effort!)  The first was dropped about 30 feet.  It destroyed the ability of the camera to show photos that had been taken, but it still worked fine in preview mode.  I hiked 200 more miles with it and took almost 1000 shots over that distance...precious shots I am deeply grateful I have.  The second was dropped in the Carribean and was packed with sand and salt water.  I rinsed it in fresh water, blew out as much moisture as I could with compressed air, and left it in a bowl of rice for about a week.  It worked fine, I gave it to my son, and he eventually bounced it down a set of stadium stairs.  It still worked but the battery door was damaged and the lens retract mechanism was shot.  We retired it.  Number three has been treated a bit more gently, but that will almost certainly change - then I will get number 4.

The camera produces decent adequate light pictures using auto mode, as long as the subject's within about 5-50'.  The fact that it takes AA batteries was a plus, although to get any decent life you have to use expensive lithium batteries.CONS: Obscure and complicated menus and adjustments in manual mode, low light capabilities are minimal, the zoom is absolutely atrocious and results in diffused, fuzzy, distorted scenes.  The movie mode is decent and the zoom seems to work sporadically during shooting- long distance movies are almost worthless.  Shooting at 8 or 12mp results in huge files but doesn't appear to upgrade the image at all.

I am now able to take maybe three pictures on a new set of batteries and then the camera shuts down and says the batteries need to be replaced.  Put new batteries in again and the same thing happens after just a couple of shots.  The picture quality is great - when it lets you take a picture.

Had a Powershot A95 that died 3 days before leaving for vacation, so I bought one of these so that I wouldn't have to spend alot of time learning to use it. What a disappointing replacement. The picture quality isn't any better than the A95 which only had 5 megapixels. It eats through batteries in about 20 minutes but when it says the batteries are low, you can turn it off and on again and it will continue on the same batteries for another 20 minutes then say they are low again so you can never tell how long they will actually last. Usually only for about 2 dozen pictures or about 2 or 3 minutes of video regardless. I go through handfuls of batteries at any event, day or night. The A95 did a 2 week trip to Europe on 8 batteries - and it took 4 at a time.Worse than the battery problem, the 1100 is unbelievably slooooow -at everything. The focus and shutter are so incredibly slow that people I've asked to take a picture for me actually get frustrated and use their own camera instead. Focus time is terrible and often poor when it finally does choose something to focus on. The delay in the shutter firing after you push the button is extremely long. Takes absolutely forever to be ready for repeat photos. The flash won't go off in low light so the shutter speed is way, way slow and pictures of anything other than a stationary object come out like crap. When the flash does go off, foreground items are super overexposed. Then the flash takes so long to recycle that whomever you are trying to take pictures of has already moved on because they figure you don't want any more pictures. If you're trying to get pictures of pets, they have to be sleeping or they just move before you can even get the shutter to go off.

Use a tripod to take photos with a \"point and shoot\" camera??  Get real.  Finally called customer service and was told to send to repair location in Illinois, at my expense.

I researched carefully, I thought, before I purchased it but am somewhat dissatisfied.  First it came without a printed owner's manual.  The manual provided was on CD Rom.  Though it was easy enough to install the software on our computer, running back and forth trying to learn how to use the camera and take pictures was to say the least \"trying\".  I wasn't about to print a 130 page manual and sent an e-mail to Canon complaining about it.  They agreed to send me a manual - in six weeks (I'm still waiting on it). Shortly after this exchange Canon sent me an e-mail requesting I rate their customer service.  I informed them I was dissatisfied, that the camera was sent without a printed manual and the prospect of waiting six weeks was unsatisfactory; they sent me a manual consisting of 130  8x11 pages stapled together stamped \"copy\" on every page frustrating me further.  Fortunately I found a third party vender who sells manuals for Canon and other camera manufacturers and purchased a spiral bound 5x8 manual for less than $20.00.  I also find battery life very short and limiting. The LCD screen is impossible to see in any non-shaded outdoor area. Fortunately it has an optical view finder.  I also noted in reading the manual I have that the camera does not have a true manual mode.

They wasted about an hour of my time before getting to that point!I've used professional Canon film cameras, and this point'n'shoot would have been perfect for my requirements if I could simply have got the pictures off it and into my computer. Considering the price, I have to give the camera 5 stars as a camera, but zero stars as a \"removable storage device.\"I have access to 6 computers, but could only connect the camera to one of them, which happens to be the least suitable for any number of reasons. Because the USB interface defines itself as an imaging device, it can only be plugged into machines running Windows XP-SP2 or later. I could do that on one of my machines, which has USB 1.0 and is therefore too slow to be practical.  The other machine has a multi-function printer/fax/scanner attached, and apparently the camera is not happy if another imaging device is already installed. After playing around with settings, unplugging the MFC, rebooting, etc, Canon's tech suggested that I remove the card from the camera and plug it into the card reader.  Well, guess what...  the card is SDHC and cannot be read by an older SD card reader.Every other digital camera that I use or have used for the last ten years will plug straight into the USB port and appear on the drive list (so will my cellphones!). Without the device conflict, that's what happens with the PowerShot, and the \"advanced features\" available in the software, related to operation of an \"imaging device\" can be ignored. So in effect the conflict which relates only to the higher level features of the interface, makes the lower level connectivity impossible.I reluctantly returned the camera, but I have had difficulty in finding anything close outside the Canon brand-- major problem being a separate optical viewfinder. Not even the PowerShot's display is usable in outside daylight conditions.  And I have also found more recently that an external card reader can be had for less than $20.

I tried all the different modes, I went online and downloaded the manual... but I could not get this camera to perform well. Indoors was the worst but outdoor wasn't a whole lot better.  I have a Canon Rebel that I love and I knew that I could not expect the same quality of photos from this smaller camera but the picture quality was absolutely awful. I have an older Kodak EasyShare that outperformed the Canon.  So I returned the Canon A1100IS and bought a Kodak C190 and the picture quality is great.  I cannot recommend this camera to anyone.

I ordered the camera back in December to take on a trip over seas last month. The camera cameduring the snow storm in our area right before Christmas. The couriers were backed up because of the snow.Someone coming to plow our driveway found the camera which wasleft outside, on top of a snow covered car in 10 degree weatherWhen I checked the tracking number on the internet, I saw thatthe time of delivery was 6:12 A. M.I received no phone call or e-mail notification that the camera had been delivered. So in essence, the camera set outside in allof that for about 5 hours until someone spotted it. I was worried that the camera might have been damaged, so I took a few test shots over Christmas. The camera seemed to work fine at thatpoint.  However, when I took it on the trip and started using it daily,it started to eat batteries. As soon as I would put new batteriesin, I would take about 10-12 pictures and the low battery lightwould come one. I went through 8 sets of batteries for a 2 1/2week trip.  I called Canon and asked if this was normal and they saidthat it wasn't. I asked if the fact that the camera wasleft out in the elements might have damaged some of the sensorsand they said it was possible, but they couldn't diagnose itwithout having me ship the camera to them.  So now I have a camera that eats batteries and that's pastthe return date so that I can't send it back. I realize thatthe shipper was facing overwhelming obstacles due to theweather in Virginia and across the country in December, butI do feel that if they had notified me that the camera wasoutside, this could have been avoided.
