{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Extensive Review By Photography Newbie", "Author": "Alan Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R24R9HY7U9WLC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is aimed at people who are new to photography, as I am in the same boat.  There are much more thorough reviews on Amazon for people who are already serious photographers.General Impression:Wonderful camera - gives you control of parameters (such as f/stop, ISO, shutter speed) when you want to play with them or get creative and will auto-select them when you just want to take pictures.  This was important to me as I am still learning to adjust them to my liking but don't want to miss out on pictures because I'm fumbling around with buttons.Construction/Feel:After going to Best Buy to physically hold the Canon T3i and Nikon d5100, I immediately decided on the Nikon.  It felt much better in my hands and just looked better in general.  Both were fairly light which is nice but also means they are made from quite a bit of plastic - not a problem though as this keeps the price down and I don't drop things.Controls:I have been pleased with the placement of the physical buttons on the camera as well as the menus.  I mainly shoot in the A, S, and M modes and the little wheel you turn to adjust the shutter speed/aperture is right where your thumb falls.  If you're in M mode, there is an aperture button to hold down just behind the shutter button which is also easy to reach with the camera up to your eye.  Lastly, the Fn button can be programmed to control the ISO level so you can hold it down while spinning the wheel to change that without putting the camera down.  I have heard people complain that the Live View switch is annoying to get to but have found it intuitive.There are a few controls that I wish were changeable without having to dig through a menu though.  For instance, to change the focus mode from area to single point requires you to have the LCD screen turned around, then press the I button, then scroll around to change it.  This is the case for a few other things like metering, shutter mode, etc.  I can't really complain, though, because those are features that go on a serious photographer's camera that costs about twice as much as this model.Auto Focus:The 11-point AF on this camera has been a dream to use.  I almost always keep the camera set to single point servo autofocus so I can select the point I want it to focus to.  As long as you have some contrast, it is very quick and accurate to focus.  This camera does not have a build in focus motor which means the lens must have it built in.  As a result, older lenses or those build for the professional Nikons may not allow for autofocus.  This hasn't been a big issues as most of the lenses I would want already have the motor built in, and if they don't, people survived for a long time manually focusing - it probably builds character.  I was torn between getting the Nikon 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5G ED AF-S DX Nikkor Wide-Angle Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Camerasand Tokina AT-X116PRDXN AT-X PRO DX 11-16mm Ultra-wide Angle Lens for Nikonand ended up sticking with the Tokina even though it would not autofocus on this camera.  I haven't had any issues with focusing manually with it as the ultra-wide angles are easy to focus anyway.Noise:A lot of the reviews I read before purchasing this camera talked about how well it shot in low light - I would have to agree.  Looking at pictures from my old point and shoot at ISO 800 have horrible noise while I can shoot this at 1600 without any, and can go up to 3200 with only minimal touch ups in Lightroom needed.  This has to be the single biggest advantage of digital over film - being able to change ISO on the fly and still being able to get great pictures at ISO 3200 is wonderful.Image Quality:I won't offer too many opinions in this section, but I have not seen anything but great quality in the RAW pictures I've taken.  Basically I understand that if a picture doesn't come out right, the fault lies with me and not the camera.  The camera is capable of much better pictures than I am capable of taking.  When I do everything right (which is becoming a little more frequent) I am amazed of the result.  Great colors, great contrast, low noise, etc.Battery Life:I purchased an extra battery before I went on a few business trips just in case, but ended up never being close to needing it.  The battery just lasts and lasts and never seems to drain.  For instance, last weekend I took 381 shots (some using live view) and the battery meter was still at 75%.  No complaints in this department.Flash:The built in flash is pretty puny, which seems to be par for the course.  It does provide some nice fill lighting if you're outside taking pictures where there are some shadows on your subject, but for shooting inside it's marginal at best.  I bought the very reasonably priced Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and have been very pleased with the combo.  The external flash adds the ability to bounce light off the ceiling and not waste the camera battery while doing so. This camera does not have the Nikon flash commander ability, but I don't think that should be expected in a camera at this price point.  If I ever start buying 3 remote flashes for studio shooting, there is a good chance I will have already upgraded cameras.I'll end by saying that this has been an absolutely wonderful camera to learn to shoot on.  Before I purchased it or started shooting, I ordered and read two books,Complete Digital Photography, 6th EditionThe Digital Photography Book, Volume 1 so I would have some clue what I wanted in a camera.  They are both wonderful books and should be required reading for all new photographers.As a disclaimer: up till 3 months ago I was never in to photography, never owned an SLR and never had any real interest to.  So know that everything I say in this review is based on very little experience.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Comes with a lot", "Author": "Summer D.

I can honestly say that aside from the quality of the camera (excellent by the way... Did a lot of online research) the kit comes with enough things to get you started. I already feel ahead of the class each time the professor recommends buying something that I already own, like filters, cleaning kits or tripods.One thing though, the bag is an original Nikon, but I found it to be too small to carry both lenses and other equipment.

You get a great deal for the price, I really couldn't ask for more. The D5100 does NOT have a depth of field preview, but that's not a very important feature for me. If it is for you, than you may want to consider getting a Canon. I'm very pleased with the camera so far, and even used it to record some fireworks in HD for the 4th of July. I hooked up the camera to my big screen TV and the quality was amazing.

Like lesser, expensive Nikons, I'd like to see regular AA batteries be used. I have yet to learn all the features.What I DON'T like is when you press the shutter, if it doesn't like your shot, it won't shoot. I've missed a few night shots that I like shooting with existing light. There must be a way, but if you are in a hurry and don't have the time to make adjustments so the camera takes the picture you want, you are screwed!I haven't yet shot the video, but I like the fact that Nikon finally added the option.

If the 2 lenses, the tripod, remote and cleaning kit don't convince you, get this bundle simply because of the 32 GB card. You're definitely going to be glad you have so much space.My only recommendation is to get a guide book for this camera. I'm using \"Nikon D5100: From Snapshots to Great Shots\" by Rob Sylvan. Absolutely everything is explained in this book, with step-by-step instructions to navigate through the menus.

The D5100 offers so much and that alone is really worth it. What I would not suggest is getting the telephoto lens 55-300 mm unless you absolutely need it or know that you want it. I did not do enough research and it turned out to be a relatively useless lens for portraits and things indoors, which are mostly my kind of photography subjects. So, I would say just buy a camera with the body only and then get some prime lenses if you're into portraits and \"people photography\". Those are much better! Nevertheless? Great bundle for beginners!", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Bundle!!!", "Author": "J. Steven Barrett \"stvbarr\"", "ReviewID": "R333ZN5IG71GFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally do not order bundles because you wind up getting a lot of sub-standard items and to be honest, things you just don't really want.  When I researched out the main items here Camera/Kit Lens/55-300 Lens, it was a pretty good deal with just that so I opted for the bundle.I've had this for about three weeks now and the d5100 has exceeded my expectations, it is a wonderful camera and I am turning the wife into a photographer's widow.  I am still exploring the myriad of choices and learning the camera itself. I generally shoot in manual (35mm Minolta XG-7 film camera with a lot of goodies) but I have to say the presets work as advertised and if you don't like the outcome you can tweak them to get something more to your liking.  The lenses' Auto Focus and Vibration Reduction work really well and you can tweak that in many ways as well as turning them off.  I think this is really way more than an entry level dslr.  Amazing stuff.The tripod is a little bit lower end, no surprise there but is still quite nice.  This will probably live out its life as a remote flash tripod.  The Canon camera bag is a nice item though you will outgrow the size if you add much of anything.  The lenses and camera take up most of the space and a speedlight will just about max it out for the larger items.  It is a nice bag to have if you are just running somewhere to take a few candids at a family gathering or something like that.  I purchased Amazon's backpack case, VERY nice, cant beat it for 30 bucks.  I'll probably review that too.  The rest of the gear fills out the camera's capabilities nicely, remote shutter release, lens filters, cleaning kit, etc.  The SD card seems to be first rate, I've had no issues with wait times for the camera to write images with this class 10 chip.Overall, I would recommend this kit highly if you are entering the dslr arena for the first time, it gives you a nice group of equipment to begin with in this realm.  If you already have equipment, you might consider a body only but I still think the lens selection along with the camera body is a winner!", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "The package is good", "Author": "adcitlali", "ReviewID": "R2L96AN250JUN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The pack is good. Of course the extra items are not the absolute best quality, but they are OK. If you buy this, do it as long as it gives you a good deal for the camera and the lens. The extras can always be better. The remote control is really handy and the camera bag is good as an initial one. It is better than 2010's Nikon bag.Anyway, I got this pack as a present for a new motivated, soon-to-be amateur photographer. I think it is ideal for initiation as long as the person is truly motivated (otherwise, just get them a point and shoot camera). Once that the person starts getting the grips of the camera and photography, they can start upgrading the camera bag for something that fits their specific needs (I usually recommend Lowepro for camera bags), a new set of high quality filters, a faster memory card, etc.The only item that I would add to this pack for a starter is the lens-pen, a truly useful cleaning item.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Seems to be great but ask again in 10 years, 2 weeks is not much of a discovery period", "Author": "Clovis Cal. dog owner", "ReviewID": "R17YEEWULGVVVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first Nikon I purchased in 1968, it is still working but film has become the problem.
