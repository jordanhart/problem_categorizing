I was desperately in need of an upgrade from my D100 but unsure of my next step. The camera world is changing so rapidly and one has to really be an informed shopper. The D3200 meets most of my current needs. The lens package is great. I had thought to rely on my old lens but I would have sacrificed some workability. Unless, you are a professional or shooting in a lot of low light or need an uber fast camera, the D3200 will more than satisfy.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Found a camera I like to replace my old one...", "Author": "serenity63379", "ReviewID": "R7MRD4LXHDGOO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Directions are easy to follow to assemble the camera and parts.  I will be shopping for an extra battery just in case I find myself in need of replacing the current one when it's depleted and I do not want to wait for the battery to charge.
