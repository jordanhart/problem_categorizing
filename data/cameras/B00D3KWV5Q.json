It appeared small, was inexpensive and was pink. However, when it arrived it was much smaller than I anticipated, too small for the intended recipient. Fortunately (for me), the package was broken open and one piece of the camera kit was missing. I was able to return it free of charge.I know nothing of the picture quality.
