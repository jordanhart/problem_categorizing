Its pictures could maybe be interesting, though not as \"off\" as you might expect from a toy -- there is potential here.  And the design is very neat.  Being able to use a memory card is a great feature in such a little camera.  There is a remarkable delay from when you press the button until it records the picture, perhaps a full second -- so it's not for action photos.  Okay, so you could get used to that quirk.  Worse,  the camera apparently leaks current, making it such a nuisance that it is not worthwhile.  I put in a new battery, after first checking it on a battery tester.  The battery was dead by the next day after using it maybe 20 times (again checking the battery on the tester).  Batteries from the same package behave normally in other devices, so it's unlikely to have been the fault of the battery.  There is something wrong with the camera's circuitry, which is a shame -- I'd hoped to like the thing.  But it's a novelty item for the shelf, if not the landfill.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "You can look far and wide", "Author": "Michelle M.
