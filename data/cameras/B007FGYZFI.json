{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A home run for the 5D series, finally!", "Author": "J. Howell", "ReviewID": "R26GA655THAEHY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't rush to make a review of this camera, as I wanted to really put it through it's paces first.  I won't try to list every feature or go over every bullet point (the above description does a fine job), but instead try to go over a few things which make a big difference to me as a 5D Mark II owner.  For some background, I bought an original 5D in 2007, a 5DII in 2008 and have been working with these bodies ever since then.  I also have experience with all of the Canon 1-series up through the 1DIII and 1DsIII.  I currently log about 60,000 photos per year with the 5D Mark IIs as a professional wedding and portrait photographer.  I shoot almost exclusively with fast L prime lenses in my work.So after a week of solid shooting with the camera, here are the areas which are of note relative to previous 5D bodies:**AUTOFOCUS**AF is the elephant in the room here so I'll address it first.  Good news, we now have a focusing system worth of it's price point.  The AF system here is identical to that in the 1Dx and is THE most sophisticated AF system EVER put in any Canon body.  It is superior to that in the 1DV and all bodies before it.I have tested the AF point in servo and one shot mode with my fastest lenses.  Speed, accuracy, and consistency have been exceptional and better than anything I have used before.  AF gets the job done with zero drama.  NO focus jitter, NO frontfocus, NO backfocus, nothing but near-instant, dead accurate focusing with all of my lenses.  Even with my Sigma 85/1.4 (which gives my 5DII bodies absolute fits) is 100% accurate with no jitter on the 5DIII.  Center AF point and all peripheral AF points are all usable with fast primes.  With the 5DII you just use the center AF point and hope for the best (with often mixed results).  You could forget using the outer AF points with fast lenses on previous 5D bodies.  That has all changed now.Just to see how far I could push it, I took my most difficult to focus lens (24/1.4 II), put it on the 5DIII, and tried to focus on my black lab in my dimly lit apartment.  At a distance of about 2 feet I would able to lock focus on the dog's eye with the far left AF point at F1.4, 1/40, ISO4000.  Think about that.  I was able to focus on a black eye on a black dog in a dimly lit apartment at F1.4.  The 5DII would have hunted all day long trying to do this, even with it's center AF point.I could sit here and write a book on how happy this performance makes me. For what I do, if this were the only upgrade from the 5D Mark II, it alone would be worth of the $3500 price tag.  That said, there is more...**BUILD QUALITY**It's hard to put my finger on exactly what changed, but the 5DIII just feels more substantial.  It feels like a chopped down 1-series instead of a buffed up 10 series.  The contour of the body has changed to fit your hand better.  The rubber is also a new compound which is much grippier than before.  The 5DIII feels much better to hold and use than the previous 5D bodies.**SCREEN**I wasn't expecting a big improvement here, but the screen is drop dead gorgeous.  The height is about the same, but it's wider than that in the 5DII and fits the aspect of horizontal images perfectly now.  The screen itself has better coatings which allow you to see it easier outside.  The contrast, viewing angle, color, and saturation have all improved noticeably.  It has a very similar look to a high end smartphone screen.  This is a substantial upgrade from the 5DII's screen.**IMAGE QUALITY**Image quality is better than the 5DII, but not substantially so.  Let me explain.The 5DIII now natively amplifies the sensor data to ISO 25,600 whereas the 5DII only natively went to ISO 6400.  This means that for anything higher than ISO 6400, the 5DIII is better.  In RAW you are looking at an improvement of about 1/2 to 3/4 of a stop at  high ISO.  At lower ISOs, the noise level is about the same.JPEG quality has improved much more though.  The JPEG engine in this camera is staggeringly good and a solid 2 stops better at controlling noise at high ISO than the 5DII.  It strikes the best balance of detail and noise control of any camera on the market right now.  Note though that default NR in JPEG mode is fairly strong and that you will generally attain a better \"look\" from your files with the \"low\" NR setting.As an aside, the nasty cross-hatch banding present in the deep shadows of 5DII files is now gone with the Mark III.  There is still mild vertical banding, but it's similar to the original 5D and only visible when pushed heavily (3 or more stops).**METERING**I don't have any hard data on this, but I'm fully convinced the metering of the 5DIII is better than that of the 5DII.  I find myself correcting with exposure compensation MUCH less now with the new body than with the mark II.  Shooting with the two side the newfound metering accuracy of the mark III is very obvious.  I found the 5DII metering very similar to the original 5D.  The new 5DIII is much improved here.**SPEED AND STORAGE**Camera startup and operation is near-instant.  Shutter lag and mirror blackout is now faster than before and leads to a more instant, responsive feel while shooting.  This, combined with the vastly improved AF make for a radically different experience from previous 5D bodies.Dual memory card slots mean you can now either backup your data to a 2nd slot *OR* you can \"span\" cards.  Spanning means that once one card is full it will automatically swtich to the second card.  SUCH a nice feature.  I can't tell you how many times my card has filled up at the most inopportune moments and shooting stopped.  No more.Shooting speed is either 3fps or 6fps and the buffer is about 18 frames deep in RAW only with a fast CF card.  You can shoot almost indefinitely in JPEG mode without hitting the buffer.  For RAW I would recommend a 60MB/s CF card to take full advantage of the CF slot speed.  The SD slot is slower, but still capable of about 30MB/s write speed.**COLOR**The 5D Mark II had a slight magenta color cast.  This was easily correctable in post processing and wasn't a huge deal most of the time.  I now report that color cast is gone and that the 5DIII's color is much more neutral.  Skin tones in general look better due to the more neutral tone.Additionally I have found auto white balance to be improved over previous 5D models.  I've noticed that while post processing I'm having to correct color less with the 5DIII files than the 5DII files. This is very exciting, as it will save me a fair amount of time in post processing.  Per usual, all of the cameras struggle under tungsten lighting.  However, AWB is able to get color surprisingly close with anything that contains natural lighting.**MENUS**I would strongly advise reading the manual because there are a lot of new settings and options which won't be familar to 5DII users.  There are also a LOT of different ways to set up your AF system, so a little experimentation is needed.  In general, the menu system is more complicated that before, but this also allows a much greater degree of customization of the camera.  In that regard, the 5DIII is much closer to a 1-series than before.  Take the time to learn it and set it up correctly.**MISC**You now have the option to one-click zoom to 100% at your AF point.  This means you can instantly check focusing with one button push.  This saves a lot of time and frustration while shooting.  There is also a \"silent\" shutter mode which only makes about 1/2 the noise as the standard shutter.  You can do one-shot or 3FPS in silent shutter mode.  6FPS continuous is only available with the standard shutter mode.Another brand new feature that's exciting is the ability to re-map buttons on the camera to perform other functions.  The options are very extensive.  One in particular I'm excited about is the ability to toggle one-shot with AI-Servo by clicking the DOF preview button (which is now on the right hand side of the camera, in perfect reach of your middle or ring finger).  If you are shooting a still subject in one-shot and they start to move, simply push the DOF preview button and you're instantly in AI Servo mode.  There is no need to move your hand, or even look away from the viewfinder.  When you are done, simply release the button and you're back in one-shot mode.**CONCLUSION**Canon finally woke up with the 5D Mark III.  The completeness of this refresh is hard to overstate, as there is no part of this camera that was left untouched from the Mark II.  The overall experience of using the camera has been transformed to an entirely different level.  You will be faster, better, and more efficient with a 5D Mark III relative to its predecessors.The improvements here will most cater to those who shoot in demanding environments which require high ISO and fast, accurate autofocus.  Canon basically fixed most every complaint anyone ever had with the 5DII while maintaining the things which made the 5DII great (resolution, image quality, small body).The price of this body is probably about $500 too high compared to its primary competition - the $3000 Nikon D800, which is likely to annoy some people.  Though individually they cater to different types of photographers and have different strengths over the other, overall these two cameras are comparable products.  If you are starting from scratch or have minimal gear investment, the D800 is worth a hard look at. If you are heavily invested in one system or another, you would probably do best just to stick with your current brand.  Both are fine cameras and you can't go wrong with either one.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Should you upgrade? Photo and video shooters, read and decide!", "Author": "David Siegfried", "ReviewID": "R160MGEJQXD4UL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was able to pre-order and the Canon 5D Mark III arrived on March 29th. I had mixed feelings when the press release first came out with the specs on the new Mark III. Several features that were high on my wish list didn't make it into the camera, but when I started seeing some of the image samples, particularly in low light, I knew I wanted it anyway.I'm currently an owner of the 5D Mk II and the 60D and my expectations were that the Mk III would inherit many of the superior handling features of the newer 60D. I am an enthusiast and not a professional photographer but I do make my living shooting product photography for online sales. For pleasure I shoot nature, architecture, and the occasional portraits. I'm also an avid fan of DSLR video and the fact that these cameras can literally capture Hollywood quality footage with few modifications is a big deal to me and a lot of people in the independent cinematography community.The much anticipated release of the 5D Mark III was a bit of a letdown to me initially. One of the things I LOVE about the 60D is the articulating screen. The articulating screen is so handy to have and a joy to use in situations where the camera needs to be at an odd angle, such as low to the ground, high above your head or in tight quarters. The other indispensable use for the articulating screen is shooting self-portraits and videos of yourself. As a one-man act, you can't shoot a video and also be in it at the same time if you can't see the screen! So I really couldn't believe it when Canon came out with the specs on the Mark III -- and NO articulating screen!? It's a feature that has been in the lower-grade 60D and T3i for over a year and a half already, and here we're paying three times the price of the 60D we don't get it? COME ON, Canon!Canon's reason for not including an articulating screen to preserve weatherproofing. To remedy this I'm getting the Swivi 5.6\" HDMI LCD Screen which is a giant 5\" articulating LCD screen that even has FOCUS PEAKING (really cool). I guess I'm making lemonade out of the lemons in this situation. Another feature that didn't make it into this camera that has all the cinematographers grumbling is there is no clean HDMI output which would allow the uncompressed video footage to be captured on an external recorder. This feature would have made this a true high-end movie making machine to rival the $30,000 RED ONE and knock the socks off the Panasonic GH2 and even the AF100. For myself, not a deal breaker... but the Nikon D800 has this. [UPDATE: The latest Canon Firmware Update 1.2.3 has enabled clean HDMI output, but it's a disappointment. The uncompressed footage is still hampered by an internal processing system that delivers soft footage.]Probably the most vexing thing that did not make it onto my wish list is the elimination of the rolling shutter problem. It has been reduced a little, but it has by no means been eliminated, so the jello effect remains an issue and impossible to completely remove in post. And so far, there has been NO program that has been able to eliminate it entirely without creating additional artifacts (believe me, I've wasted untold hours trying them all). Rolling shutter has only been reduced by 20% or so and I won't be fully satisfied shooting video until we get the global shutter and eliminate this unprofessional looking artifact altogether.Continuous autofocus during video? It's not even an option. The Panasonic GH1/GH2 have it, and do it well. And now the Nikon D800 can auto focus continuously during video recording too, and includes face detection to keep subjects in focus. The only option for autofocus with this camera whole shooting video is still the old way: press the AF-ON button, and you'll set a clunky, noisy, re-focus point. So don't think about replacing your camcorder yet. Shooting video with this camera remains a manual focus affair best handled with a rig and follow-focus setup... classically handled as a two-man operation.Those are my three primary disappointments. Now the fun part: all the great things (and more) that DID make it into my wish list:1. Live View focusing with half depress of shutter button. The Mk II had a really awkward way of focusing while in Live View mode. You had to depress the separate AF button on the BACK of the camera, then hold absolutely still while you moved your finger back to the shutter button, and then take the shot. The Mk III acts just like the 60D in that you half press the shutter to focus, just as it SHOULD, which is to say exactly like shooting with a viewfinder. And you no longer have to go into the menu and set Live View to Stills-Only in order to get Exposure Simulation: The Mark III has a handy dedicated movie/stills mode switch.2. Better low-light performance. Nikon has been beating out Canon in high ISO performance since the D3, then the D3s, the D3x, and the D700. It's taken two product cycles for Canon to finally catch up. The Mk II was the low-light king when it came out, and still performs exceptionally well, but the Mk III takes it to a new level. My initial test shots show that ISO 12800 on the Mk III has about the same noise levels as ISO 6400 on the Mk II, but with better sharpness and improved color rendition. ISO 12800 is actually usable for high-quality work, whereas at ISO 25600 things start to fall apart--but still plenty good enough for smaller web images. These ISO settings will allow you to actually get the shot even at night in situations that were previously unthinkable. Most importantly, overall image quality in terms of dynamic range and the quality of the noise at high ISOs has been improved for both stills and video.The claims were that ISO 25600 on this camera was going to be like ISO 6400 on the Mark II, a two stop improvement. The truth is that it's not. It's just about a one stop improvement, maybe slightly more, but that's still a significant achievement.3. No megapixel escalation! I was relieved that Canon DIDN'T try to stuff 36 megapixels into the Mk III. They kept it roughly the same at 22mp. Way to go, Canon! It's been proven time and time again that more megapixels doesn't make for a sharper image, only larger file sizes. \"More megapixels equals better image quality is what's known as \"the megapixel myth\" Cramming in more megapixels means a lower signal-to-noise ratio and less full well capacity for each photo site. At some point you don't get more detail with a higher pixel count; you just spread the detail around on more pixels. I hardly ever need 21mp as it is, and I am absolutely relieved not to be dealing with larger files because I often shoot RAW.4. Exposure bracketing. The Mk II could only do 3 exposure bracket shots automatically; the Mk III can do up to 7. Bingo! But you have to go to page 316 in the manual under Custom Settings to read how. It's not even in the index and the main entry under Exposure Bracketing says it does 3 (the default) and doesn't even mention that it can do up to 7. There is also White Balance Bracketing (redundant if you shoot RAW), but unfortunately no focus bracketing (focus stacking). That would have thrilled me. (Focus bracketing/stacking function is available via the Unified Magic Lantern Firmware for the 550D/60D/600D/50D/500D.)5. Chromatic aberration correction. A feature inherent to Nikon and Panasonic micro 4/3, it's about time Canon got it. But it's unclear whether RAW images processed with PhotoShop Adobe RAW already have this applied or not... and you have to load in lens profiles manually. I will have to experiment with this.6. Improved White Balance settings. One of the major gripes I have with all cameras is the accuracy of the Auto White Balance. Sure AWB works fine outdoors in natural light, but in indoor light it's usually awful. Even the tungsten setting is rarely accurate. Invariably I've had to create custom white balance settings on all my cameras using a white card. But FINALLY, on the Mk III, not only is the tungsten setting accurate, even the Auto setting gives decent results indoors.7. Electronic Level. The 60D has it on the LCD. The 5D Mk III now has it. But get this--the Mk III not only has a side-to-side level, it has a FRONT TO BACK level too! Great for architectural photography. And there's more--a grid overlay and electronic level in the VIEWFINDER. (Once again you must go into Custom settings to set a shortcut button to enable this.) This is way more than I was hoping for and Canon gets bonus points for this.8. Quiet shutter. The shutter noise from \"mirror slap\" has been greatly reduced even in Standard mode, and there's a new \"silent shooting mode\" where you don't hear the mirror at all. This is something I've always wanted in an SLR, and was pleasantly surprised. I guess Canon WAS listening after all.9. Auto ISO in manual mode. This is so cool. You can set the camera to M, set the exact shutter speed and f/stop that you want, and let Auto ISO choose the ISO for the correct exposure. Considering that this camera gives good results up to ISO 12800, this is a really great way to achieve the exact depth of field and stop motion effect that you want, and let the camera pick the right ISO. Couldn't do this in Mk II. Works with stills and video.9. Full video exposure control. Speaking of videos, the ability to control exposure when shooting videos has been greatly improved. The Mk II was the camera that started the whole DSLR movie craze. I'm sure that Canon never imagined when they stuck this feature onto the Mk II as an add-on, that it would explode into the DSLR cinematography revolution that it has. But the Mk II was severely hampered by crude exposure control. Now, full manual control is available. Strangely though, only auto ISO is available in Av, Tv, and P. There are more shooting modes: 1080p at 24, 25, or 30 FPS and 720p mode now does 50 or 60 FPS, with two compression options,including an I-frame only compression for better quality suitable for grading.A whole wave of enthusiasts use the Magic Lantern firmware patch that allows cinematographers to gain access to enhanced functionality like manual audio, zebras, focus assist tools, and more. The Mk III now handles a few of these functions naively such as manual audio (and a headphone jack), plus a video ISO range that goes to 12,800 with 25,600 as an option.UPDATE 6-2013: A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN THE MAGIC LANTERN FIRMWARE: Amazingly, Magic Lantern has released a version that enables recording of 14-Bit RAW 1080p directly to a CF card. This is a total game changer and a huge buzz in the DSLR video community right now. (!!) the RAW footage blows away the internal H.264 codec in terms of both resolution and dynamic range. Once again a Canon camera called 5D is shaking up the independent cinematography industry big time! Stay tuned.10. The 4GB video file size limitation. Finally, Canon has crossed the 4gb file size barrier and supports file spanning. Now clips can go as long as 30 minutes instead of 12. A big improvement, but come on... The Panasonic GH1 & GH2 have been able to shoot video with NO time limitation for years. Continuous shooting is a MUST HAVE for event videographers. Sorry, this wish-list item still doesn't make the full cut. Why do camera manufacturers hamstring this when it's obvious these cameras are capable of unlimited video recording? Thirty minute cutoff due to a European tax law... can someone fix this PLEASE?There is much more... of course the completely overhauled complex AF system, primarily for action shooters, dual CF and SD card support, and in-camera HDR and other image combining effects...Biggest annoyance: the AF point selection button no longer controls magnification in Live View and playback mode. This is a big pain when you want to use focus assist in Live View, because you can no longer just use your right thumb... you have to take your left hand from the lens to press the magnify button which is now on the left side of the LCD. I hate when they move a button from the perfect spot to one that is NOT ERGONOMIC. Workaround: You can assign Magnify to the `Set' button which is on the right (but not to the old button which would have been better).So here's the big question: at list price of thirty-five hundred dollars, should you upgrade? My thoughts:A. If you are primarily a through-the-viewfinder still photographer shooting in good light (outdoors and flash), it's rather hard to justify the extra cost. Many of us have barely scratched the surface of the creative possibilities of the Mk II, and in many ways this is not a major upgrade for traditional style, properly lit photography. This camera isn't going to make you a better photographer, though some of the new tools like the electronic level are quite handy.B. Cinematographers: There's already a lot of carping and moaning in the video camps that this upgrade is a big disappointment. I think it's great for part-time video shooters like me, but it's missing a lot of features that the pros were hoping for. Of course if they want all those pro features they can buy the Canon C300 for $16,000. But current users locked into Magic Lantern are probably going to have to wait for Magic Lantern to catch up anyway. They've already got Magic Lantern for the T2i, T3i, 50D and 60D, so it's just a matter of time. [UPDATE: THE MAGIC LANTERN HACK IS AVAILABLE WITH EVEN MORE OPTIONS INCLUDING SHOOTING RAW VIDEO.]C. Low light / night photographers, action sports, theater and concert shooters, documentary videographers: This upgrade is a MUST! This camera sets a new benchmark for image quality in less than optimal light conditions. That one stop advantage, better color depth and dynamic range in existing light is important to these guys and gals. The image quality improvement in low light is very noticeable.C. The rest of us. Many pros are going to want this model, if not now, eventually. The state-of-the art feature set is quite impressive; the handling improvement is modest. For hobbyists, the steep price may be difficult to justify. The Mk II is still a fantastic tool and unless you really need ISO 12800 this isn't going to give you significantly better images than you can already achieve with the marvelous Mk II.My verdict: An enthusiastic Five Stars as a still photography camera; Four Stars overall due to the lack of three important features that have been available from Panasonic for several years already: articulating screen, continuous autofocus during video, and unlimited video recording time.If you're on the fence about upgrading or even a first time buyer, I hope my review has been useful. Happy Shooting!", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "4.8 stars", "Author": "Coronet Blue", "ReviewID": "R2UIGM7E18EP4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some quick observations on the 5D3.  Before I go further I should explain I'll be comparing vs. the 5D2 and second, if you need to know about video, I can't be of any help there.Received camera body from Amazon on 3/23.  Lots of new features (5D2 manual is 259 pages; 5D3 manual is 403 pages).  For the work I do, I was looking for two improvements over the 5D2:  Ability to bracket more than 3 shots and much lower noise.  The first wish was granted.  As you probably know, the 5D3 does 7 exposures.  Nikons do 9, but 7 is almost always enough.  Those who need more will probably have a Promote remote anyway.  Noise?  Well, the 5D3 images are cleaner but I wouldn't say dramatically so.  With the default noise settings and long exp NR set on, I'd say it's 1 to 1.5 stops better than the 5D2.  Now, with a little Noiseware or other NR, you can get very clean images at 12800 with very little loss of detail so I don't consider this a problem.  I guess it was unrealistic to expect the 5D3 to match the very low noise of my D700 but it would have been nice.It's true that nearly every feature on the 5D3 is an upgrade over the 5D2.  Not all of these will result in better images but it's fair to say that the entire \"feel\" of the 5D3, the layout, viewfinder, displays are all nicer than the 5D2.  The two things that may be game changers, IMO, are the shutter and the AF.  If you haven't heard and felt the shutter on the 5D3, you're in for a treat.  It isn't just quieter; there is much less kick from the mirror.  Add the \"silent\" mode and, wow.  I would not be surprised to see signs in the future that say \"Please set your camera to silent mode\".  As for AF, I never had a problem with the AF on the 5D2 so I'm less impressed here.  But if you shoot moving subjects, the 5D3 has it all--predictive, wrap around, sequential, selective.  The manual devotes 45 pages to setting autofocus.A small thing that I've been waiting for, a dual axis electronic level is wonderful.  For some time, digital SLRs have had an \"artificial horizon\" that tells you if you are tilting the camera to the left or right.  That's nice but in almost all imaging software, rotating an image takes just a second.  What these left/right levelers don't tell you is if you are tipping the camera up or down which can be a real pain with a super wide lens.  Well, problem solved with the 5D3.The in-camera HDR is a mixed bag.  Output is jpeg only and even at that, it takes awhile for the 5D3 to register the images.  (This could be my cards which are Lexar UDMA 400x & Sandisk Extreme IV).  Anyhow, it's a fun feature.  This brings me to yet another interesting feature.  Since the 5D3 has two cards (CF + SD) you can record different file types to each card.  In other words, you could have a RAW-only card and a JPEG-only card.  I haven't tried this but I presume this would mean that you could shoot everything RAW except in-camera HDRs which, being jpegs, would end up on the other card.  I get requests for jpegs so now I can put them on one card while keeping an all-RAW card for myself.  You can also have redundant cards for backup, sequential for extra capacity, etc.  As with the autofocus options, the possibilities are endless!So, to summarize.  Pros: Better AF, 100% viewfinder with electronic grid (no more screens), better LCD, faster drive and processor, fabulous shutter/mirror, 7-stop bracketing, 2-axis level, somewhat lower noise and thus somewhat cleaner images vs. 5D2, two card slots, uses same batteries as 5D2.  Cons:  Still no built-in flash (yes, it's very handy), in-camera HDR so-so, mode knob still feels flimsy (and it locks now, so be careful). All in all, this is a very nice, refined camera and anybody trading up from a 5D2 will be happy.  And if you do get a 5D3, the person getting your 5D2 will be happy as well.Just a footnote.  One thing that comes through loud and clear from these reviews is how very different people's needs are and how differently they use a camera.  I can only explain how a product meets or fails to meet my needs.  I would not dream of saying you do/don't need this feature or \"read and decide\" as if I was some sort of oracle.  You know what is or is not important to you and how much you're willing to pay for it.  The web has made everybody a professional and an expert but when it's your money, the only expert is you.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great All around camera for any situation", "Author": "Phaseout", "ReviewID": "R1GPRH0BG4O82I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently sold my Canon 7D and saved up to get this camera. After hearing so much talk about how much better the D800 is and how the Mark III is not worth the money, I decided to give it a shot rather than be influenced by comments on the web by people who never shot with the camera. Upon first inspection after opening my kit I was impressed at how sturdy and professional the camera felt. I always felt the 7D was very tough and sturdy but the 5D takes it to another level. The grip is great and sticks to your hand. It also covers the batter compartment. The camera grip has a great indent for your hand and an excellent thumb rest. Overall ergonomics are fantastic and the camera has a slick look but is bigger than the 7D at every dimension. No confusing this with an entry or midlevel camera. It screams pro, even without a grip.The settings were easy to navigate and the dials are all in familiar places for the most part. The new zoom requires an extra keypress but I found it better to use the wheel than the old zoom in/out buttons once you get used to it. The new rate button on the left side seemed a bit useless to me but I reprogrammed it to protect images. The LCD was big and bright and shows lots of crisp detail when zooming in. Also very usable for macro with it's quick focus zoom. The best LCD I have ever seen on a camera. The Viewfinder also big and bright. Huge improvement over what you see using a cropped sensor. This is one of the many reasons to go full frame.Now onto using the camera. Coming from the 7D I enjoyed pretty good autofocus but the 5D Mark III dominates it in every way. It is super fast, accurate and locks on in really dim light. There are several action modes to select for the autofocus that react to the type of movement that you choose. Really groundbreaking stuff. I found nothing negative to say about it. I spent an afternoon shooting a kids party outdoors with the 24-105 f/4. The kids were running around like maniacs and I came away with many great in focus shots.In the past when using Auto ISO in manual mode I was nervous when it went to 3200 because of noise. No such case with this camera. Indoor photos without a flash are no problem. Especially when you use a nice bright prime. I can shoot ISO 6400 all day and it will look like ISO 1600 on a 7D. I know most people dont shoot Jpeg but if you ever want some painless shots of your kids or family and dont want to mess around with too much post processing, this camera produces the finest jpegs you will find in a camera. Obviously raw files are sharper and I found the RAW files from the MKIII to be sharp and contrasty. Noise is well controlled though obviously noisier than the jpegs. Overall the image quality is excellent.A new addition to the camera I thought was awesome was the silent mode shooting. It does reduce your frame rate to 3 FPS but what you get in return in this mode is virtually silent performance with much less shutter vibration. A really awesome and underrated feature. One of the many improvements people forget to mention about this camera.I have to say there is something special to me about the 5D Mark III. It's a camera that I just have fun with. Its fast, easy to use, produces great results at perfect file sizes. Gives you various options for jpeg and RAW to meet your needs. I'm sorry I cannot review the video but I have not had a chance to test it in detail in order to provide one.I know people constantly say that it's $500 more than the Nikon D800 but the truth is that it really isnt. In the end you will end up spending more on Nikon gear because it's just more expensive. Just an example.D800 + 24-120 f/4 = $4,2995D MKIII kit with 24-105 f/4 = $4,299Nikon 24-70 f/2.8 = 1,899Canon 24-70 f/2.8 = 1,375add the grip, other lenses and a flash and you pay more than the Canon equivalents.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "A huge improvement in almost every way.", "Author": "Phil Rosenthal", "ReviewID": "RV56UKSXECVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an upgrade from a Canon EOS 5D Mark II for me.Auto-focus* As most people know, the auto-focus on the 5D Mark II was a horrible weak spot -- only the center point was a \"cross point\", so none of the other points were accurate enough for fast f/1.2 and f/1.4 lenses, and the focusing speed in general was just not great.  Mark III has professional-level autofocus now, with a wide array of cross point locations (exact number varies depending on the lens you are using), and very fast focusing speed. What was a major down-side is now a major up-side.Low Light* As mentioned above, the autofocusing is improved, and the differences in low light are very noticeable.* Canon also claims a major improvement in noise at high ISO's.  Personally, I do see an improvement, but not a huge improvement.Exposure Bracketing / HDR / Stacking* The  Mark II supported only 3 exposures with bracketing, the Mark III now supports 7 exposures -- A huge improvement in the software for anyone doing HDR.* The Mark III has in-camera HDR processing, which is nice (perhaps to get an idea how something looks, on the spot), but not something I'll actually use for final images (I'm sure the processing abilities of HDR software on my desktop is going to be better than in a battery powered camera).* The Mark III supports in-camera image stacking, which can be used for a variety of creative and scientific effects -- I haven't played with this yet, but this may be very useful for me.SD Card* Having a second slot, with the second one being SD is a very nice addition, you can now put an Eye-Fi in your second slot, save jpeg to the eye-fi, have photos show up on your iPad in realtime, and have the RAW's saved to a CF card.  Great for both pros and hobbyists.* You can have two 32GB cards, one CF, one SD, and store all of your pictures with two backups in case one card fails -- great for pro's.* The software actually interacts with an Eye-Fi, so you can see the status of what the card is doing, a huge improvement over the hack-ish CF->SD->Eye Fi support in the Mark II.Silent mode* Your wedding photographer can now take many photos of the exchange of vows without making it sound like a paparazzi session.* It is perhaps quiet enough for you to even take a few shots in places where photography is generally frowned onBurst mode* 6FPS is a major improvementPhysical feel* This is something that doesn't really fit on a spec sheet, but the Mark III generally feels much stiffer / heavier / \"professional\" than the Mark II -- much closer to a \"1\" feel.Megapixels* This was of course a let-down to many (including me).  I do a lot of landscape photos, and very little sports/clubs, etc ... For my photos, noise reduction can be handled with very long exposures, and low ISO (and other methods).  That said, the camera was such a large improvement in every other way, I am still happy.Learning Curve* There are so many new features / modes, it will actually take some time and practice (and reading to fully utilize the new body), not a complaint -- but I was not expecting this coming from a 5D Mark IIUPDATE: After a trip to hawaii and a few weeks of usage, my opinion has improved a lot, and I've changed it from 4 stars to 5.  The lower noise enables handheld macro photography in lower light situations than possible before, and the intuitive improvements to software have really made some huge improvements.  While there is a large improvement to the autofocus, but only a minor improvement to pixel count -- the very large number of minor improvements in the software have made it to the point that I couldn't imagine going back to the 5D Mark II.

Both cameras are phenomenal and when using the best glass for each, I'd be very impressed if anyone could look at a photo and said that it came from a 5D3 or a D800.  DXOMark is considered by many to be the authority on how cameras stack up.  The rivalry between the 5D3 and D800 is well-known to those who are interested and DXO has actually even published an article on how they compare.  DXO is known, however, to heavily favor Nikon bodies than Canon bodies where even some crop frame Nikon bodies are apparently 'better' than even the best Canon bodies.  I believe that the DXO formula for what makes a high scoring camera is biased towards the Nikon but I don't knock their results.  So here I'd like to address two main reasons why someone would want to get a D800 over the 5D3 from a person (me :D) who owns and is very happy shooting weddings with a 5D3:\"The D800 has better dynamic range\"-This is true.  The D800 gives you very nice depths that the 5D3 can't spit out.  However, this only happens at lower ISO settings.  Take a look at the chart here: [...]  You'll see that from ISO800 and up, the dynamic range of both cameras start to converge upon the same values.  Weddings are action-packed and you can't afford to miss a moment thus you will need a high shutter speed to get the shot.  I don't remember the last time I shot a wedding below ISO800 because I like more depth of field to my images and there must not be any blur.  I tell people that if I didn't shoot weddings, I would have bought a D800.  If you shoot in a studio or take photos of bridges and whatnot, the D800 would be an excellent tool for your use.  But if you are doing action, there's really no difference in this department.\"The D800 has more megapixels\"-This is true.  If you need/want that many more megapixels, then the D800 is your camera.  More megapixels is nice because you can crop a full sized image to the point where you won't even need a short telephoto for up-close shots.  But if this is not as important to you, and you don't want huge raw files, meaning more hard drive space, get the 5D3.  The one downside with the D800 is this, because your files are so large, the buffer during rapid-fire shots cannot keep up with the 5D3.  Going back to my weddings - rapid fire shots are required all the time because you don't want to get a money shot with the main subjects blinking.  A photogs worst nightmare!So there you have it.  I'm pretty sure that my review was useless to you if you: are a Nikon fanboy/girl, never shoot above ISO800, need the best dynamic range for details, have lots of Nikon glass and like that the D800 is cheaper than the 5D3.  Here are my reasons for why the 5D3 is nice for my purposes:1) Canon quality control beats Nikon (google Nikon D600 oil+dust, D800 left AF problem)2) Better burst firing capabilities3) Ergonomically more comfortable (but to each his/her own)4) Manageable file size + ability to do smallRAW and mediumRAW5) Canon has lenses that Nikon does not have or are not as good - 50L, 85L, 135L, 70-200 2.8L II.  But Nikon makes a crazy good wide angle zoom - the 14-24.  It just depends on what you like to shoot.6) With the right lenses, the 5D3 produces sharper images than the D800 (a DXOMark result)And lastly, for the record, I am not a Canon fanboy, just a shooter who wants the best gear for a particular purpose.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Converted from D7000", "Author": "Matthew Hull", "ReviewID": "R3MNX4B7KMTUQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, where do I begin.To start with, I've been a Nikon guy up until this point.  Going back to my first SLR with the N80 film camera back in the day (god only knows how many rolls of film I exposed with that thing), to the D70, the D200, and the D7000.  I was skeptical of all the hype around the 5D3, so being a cautious man I rented it and a 16-35 LII first.  As soon as I held the camera in my hand, I knew I was hooked on the ergonomics alone.  Further shooting continued to impress with it's amazing user experience, refined menus, and incredible autofocus performance.  So I ended up buying a 5d3 along with a 35 1.4 L.  (16-35 had too much distortion for my applications)Ergonomics:This thing fits your hand like a well worn glove.  My hands are on the small side being only 5'7\" tall, but even the big full frame body just snugs in my hand like it was custom designed for me.  You really need to hold this camera to believe how ergonomically amazing it really is.  It balances perfectly both with the 16-35L II and the 35 1.4 L.  The physical buttons are very customizable, letting you configure the camera to make it's operation so intuititve, it just gets completely out of the way and let's you focus completely on shooting.User Experience:The top notch physical ergonomics and the customizeable buttons combine to make a user experience like I've never had before.  I liken it to my Volkswagen GTI - everything is in the perfect spot and the product feels like it was designed to maximize the joy in the user experience.  It really must be used to be believed.Refined Menus:Despite being a Nikon DSLR users since 2004 with the D70, I've never got used to Nikon's menus.  On my D7000, changing anything takes me forever just to find the item.  I've had the 5D3 for less than a week, and I can already find items right away.  Maybe it has to do with Canon's method of Horizontally orienting the menus, instead of Nikon's veritical orientation.  I'm really not sure, but I know for me the menu is so much more intuitive than Nikon.Autofocus Performance:Autofocus performance is simply stunning.  I've heard it said in the photography world that Nikon has accurate and slow autofocus, and Canon has inaccurate but fast autofocus.  I've used the 5D3 to shoot challenging indoor sports, and I'm blown away by it's speed AND it's accuracy.  On both the 16-35 and the 35 1.4, the autofocus feels like it BITES into the subject.  It's very confidience inspiring, letting you worry about important things like Light, Color and Gesture.Screen:While I admit that I have not personally tried a D800, several reputable review sites complain of it's green tinted dispaly.  This is not confidence inspiring.  The 5D3's display is just gorgeous - bright enough to see outdoors, responsive, quick, and accurate.Why I went with the 5D3 instead of the D800:After analysis, I felt like 5D fit my 'shoot from the hip' style of photography best.  The d800, as evidenced in DxO Mark and other sources, cleary gives better technical IQ.  But as most of my work is indoor sports and candid photography, the 5D was the clear winner for it's silent continuous AF-DRive mode, higher FPS (4 vs 6) in fast mode, user experience, and legendary canon autofocus.Conclusion:This camera was cleary designed with THE PHOTOGRAHER in mind.  It becomes transparent , letting you focus on what matters - Light Color and Gesture.  To me, this is the clincher.  LCG are really what is most important in photography.Update 10.24.2012Color:I used to convert all my images to B&W; when I shot Nikon.  With this camera however, I find myself loving the way color images look.  Colors are deep and smooth, without being overly saturated and harsh.  I find myself using Silver EfxPro less and less.  I'll A/B in lightroom between the color image and the B&W; converted image, and the color image has some inexplicable ethereal quality that I love.  Remember Kodack NC and VC film?  This camera renders skin tones like NC, and colors like a slightly less saturated VC.  It's a beautiful balance - it has a soul to it, like an old Fender Twin reverb tube guitar amplifer.  Smooth and soulful.Now admittedly this could just be an evolution of my style, but I thought I would throw this in here and you can take it with a grain of salt.  Also note that I think a lot of my love for this camera comes from my love of the 35 1.4 L that stays glued to it.  Also #2, I always shoot RAW.  So I can not comment on the camera's color modes or .JPG engine.Also #3, I've learned with this camera to \"overexpose\" by about 2/3 EV and turn down exposure by 1/3 to 2/3 in post.  When you do this, the noise performance in the shadows is stunning.Update 01.11.2013I'm continually amazed at how clean the sensor says.  Using the D7000 in the same environment I'm using the 5D3 in, I was forced to continually clean the sensors.  The 5D3's sensor cleaner is quite effective - I have a sensor loupe, and even upon inspecting the sensor that closely I still haven't seen a single particle of dust adhere to the sensor.  This could also be a testament to the 5D3's weather sealing. You may think \"yea, big deal\" but dust can be difficult to remove from photos without leaving any traces.Loving this camera more and more.Update 05.07.2013I know I mentioned the autofocus above, but I wanted to talk about how much I love the spread of those cross type focus points.  Having 41 (YES, FORTY-ONE) of those things to choose from really enables some creative freedom with regards to composition.  I shoot a lot at f/1.4, so the whole \"focus then recompose\" thing just doesn't cut it for me.  The focus points cover a large portion of the frame, which lets you put your subject closer to the edge of the frame for some cool negative space or environmental compositions.  It can be tough to see your photo this way, but once you realize you can do it it becomes a powerful story telling tool.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely great", "Author": "MT1", "ReviewID": "R1O28ZM4V1N9RU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The switch from Nikon:After being with nikon for 16+ years, I recently threw in the towel. As a wedding shooter, I count on my equipment and need things to work correctly.I had purchased two nikon d600's 1 year apart and both had the horrible dust/debris issue. After repeat cleanings and 20,000+ shots, both cameras still had the issue. I got tired of wet cleaning the sensors and got tired of nikons poor customer service. Nikon decided that the D600 owners just had to either deal with repeat sensor cleanings or send in the camera to \"possibly\" have the issue resolved. Nikon had no proven fix besides switching out the shutter and praying that the issue went away. Nikon released the d610 and left the rest of the people hanging.Leaving nikon was extremely difficult for me because I had a big investment in the bodies, accessories and glass. I made the move at a huge loss but am extremely happy that I did.The differences:I purchased both a 6D and the 5D mark III from amazon. The immediate thing that I have noticed is that all my canon glass has been good with focus right out of the box. With almost every nikon lens/camera combo, I had to pull out a focus chart and focus tune software and apply fine tuning. I also noticed that the focus system on my canons do not have the tendency to act up under tungsten lighting like my nikons did. My d600's and d7000 had a tendency to back-focus under heavy tungsten lighting.The canon DPP software is a pleasure to use. I hated Nikon capture NX2. It was slow and the user interface was horrible. Canon DPP loads quickly and applying batch changes is amazing. I do miss the Nik software selection point feature of CNX2.The one thing I don't like is the fact that canon makes you purchase your lens hoods separately and at a premium.I do like the fact that the canon equipment is made in japan and has a quality feel to it compared to cameras like the d600 that are made in Thailand.The 5D mark iii vs D800:Prior to leaving nikon, I also spent a week with the nikon D800. I found that the d800 produced a lot of noise in the raw files when pushed to higher iso's. This alone was enough to turn me off. I did test my sample of the d800 for left focus issues. I did not have the left AF issue of older d800's but the camera I got had some focus issues that required fine tuning all my glass to the body. In some cases the fine tune was at +20.The D800 files did have a lot of detail and dynamic range but the file size was huge. If you shoot a lot of landscape and want lots of dynamic range, the d800 is a good option. But the dynamic range comes at the cost of nikons lack of quality control.If dynamic range is not your main goal but want a great reliable camera with a killer AF system (better in my testing) and smaller files, the canon 5D mark III is amazing. I suggest not to get caught up in the megapixel game unless you do some very heavy cropping like birds in flight for which the d800 may be a better choice. The 5D mark III files are great and have plenty of latitude for most users.5D mark III:Focus:Focus Focus Focus. The 5D mark III has a killer focus system. The best that I have used. The focus system is lighting fast, accurate and very very customizable. It is a pleasure to be able to customize my focus system like this. I recently shot an event and out of 700+ images, I scrapped maybe 10 shots because of focus. The ones I did delete because of focus was do to me not placing the focus point on the right area of the image. No back/front focus like my nikons had. No focus shift under tungsten lighting like some nikons.The hit rate on focus is amazing. You want to know why canon can charge a premium for this camera? Because of its pure amazing focus system! If you absolutely need the best focus system on any camera, this is it.Customization:You can assign buttons to do certain functions and to your own shooting style. This is a god send compared to nikons lack of customization.Body:The camera is solid with a good feel in the hand. The buttons are easy to operate and cleverly located. Coming from nikon is an adjustment because the camera buttons are in a different layout. It will become easy to use after some time and practice.I did not like the fact that canon has no built in removable screen protector like the nikon. This is a minor gripe but one that I resolved by buying the vello stick on glass protectors. I know the nikon plastic screen protectors are not fancy but they did a good job of protecting the screen from bumps.Images:The 5D makr III images are fantastic. The auto white balance works much better compared to my nikons I had owned. The 5D mark III is not able to pull details from the shadows like the D800 or D600 so it is a sacrifice in dynamic range if that is the most important thing to you. Nikon still has canon beat in dynamic range.I will personally will take a in focus, sharp, good out of camera white balance and dust free image out of a canon any day vs a hit and miss focus and dusty d600 image with dynamic range. An out of focus image with dirt is useless to me.Conclusion:If you shoot anything that requires this focus system, this reliability and this customization, BUY THIS CAMERA. I found the 5d and 6d is a perfect combo. I use the 6D with the wifi feature when working in a studio paired to an ipad and use the 5D when shooting a wedding or anything that moves at a fast pace.The 5d mark III continues to sell even at the higher price because it is a proven camera and you cant go wrong with it.

My subjects don't sit still or have a lot of patience, so AF speed and accuracy and general handling are big for me. That's why I never was a big fan of the 5D Mark II; I always considered the 7D the better camera of the two, its sensor size disadvantage being more than compensated for by the better AF system and ergonomics. All this changed with the arrival of the 5D Mark III, of which I am now a happy owner, after two rentals made me a convert.My experiences: AF is vastly improved over the 7D; with fast lenses (135 f/2L, various versions of the 70-200) I can shoot wide open and focus is exactly where I want it to be. I'd always chimp to double check on the 7D; on the 5D Mark III I still do, but it is unnecessary, because practically every shot is in perfect focus. AI servo is a treat to use, and I find myself taking more action shots than I ever did before. Shutter lag is almost non-existent, and I have been able to get shots of dancers in mid air consistently through pure timing without using the burst mode. Noise levels are much lower. With the 7D, ISO 800 and above resulted in iffy photos, but with the Mark III, ISO 3200 is very usable. For some reason, I also see an improvement in dynamic range, with more shadow detail preserved than on the 7D, which is a big help in recovering imperfectly exposed shots. Finally, even at low ISOs, it seems like the 5D captures more detail than the 4.3 MP advantage over the 7D would seem to indicate. If there is one minor complaint, it is that the jpg photos straight from the camera look a little flat. I believe this is due to very aggressive NR being applied in camera. Shooting RAW results in large files that take noticeably longer to process in Lightroom than my old 7D RAWs. In actual practice, very little if any NR is needed until you get to ISO 1600.What Canon appears to have done is to combine the ergonomics of the 7D with the IQ of the 5D Mark II - and then, almost impossibly, improve upon the result. What you have is a camera that does its job very very well, thus allowing you to focus on yours, which is composition, lighting, and timing. Using this camera is, as a friend of mine put it, like a tiger getting its first taste of human blood. Once you see how much better it is than anything else you've used, nothing less will do.Update May 2014: Nearly a year after purchasing this camera I feel compelled to add a few more words. Because this camera does what it does so well, it (and the full frame lenses that go with it) has improved my photography beyond all expectation; it is an absolute joy to simply have to concentrate on the scene and have complete confidence that the camera will capture in beautiful detail what your eyes and mind perceive; I never had this level of trust in the 7D or the 450D. I want to emphasize again the difference in sharpness and contrast between the RAW files and the in camera JPGs. The in camera JPGs use horrendously destructive noise reduction - to the point that the camera probably ought to flash a warning in the viewfinder when you shoot in JPG. Make doubly certain you are shooting in RAW for anything that is critical.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "My switch from Nikon was successful but the landing was a little rough", "Author": "S. Collins", "ReviewID": "R28CTSFANB07HJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a background, I've been shooting SLRs for nearly 35 years. I've owned and loved my Nikon D300, battery grip, and Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 and 14-24mm f/2.8 lenses for 5 years. I was ready to upgrade to a \"hybrid\" stills and video camera, but my primary passion is stills photography.Like most Nikon photographers, I was extremely excited about the Nikon D800 when it was announced, but paused as it became clear that there were some manufacturing problems that were being sorted out. I waited a year and recently purchased a D800 body with serial 305xxx from Amazon, thinking that surely the left-focus issue was behind us. I was incorrect.  After two bodies exhibiting the same unacceptable left-sensor-focus problem, and despite witnessing the most amazing dynamic range I've ever seen from a DSLR sensor, I decided to take a deep breath and switch to Canon.However, my switch from Nikon was not without its challenges--mostly due to apparent manufacturing tolerance issues between the 5D Mark III body and several L lenses that I ordered.  The first 24-70mm f/2.8L II, 70-200mm f/2.8L IS, 50mm f/1.2L did not focus properly.  For all three of these lenses, micro-adjustments were not adequate to fix the problems.  However, the second copies of two out of three of these lenses were fantastic (I gave up finding a 50mm f/1.2 that could focus).  The 24-70mm f/2.8L II in particular is the sharpest lens I've ever used on any camera at f/2.8.Now that the lens problem is sorted out, I offer the following review:Image quality: Subject detail for a 22MP sensor is astounding (especially with the 24-70mm f/2.8 II) and the color rendition is wonderful--much better auto white balance than the D800.  Dynamic range is only acceptable; I occasionally see shadow noise and banding with dark, colorful subjects at ISO 100 when I push the images slightly in post (but oddly, not at higher ISOs).  Likewise, highlights can't be recovered as reliably as I would expect.  Canon has some room for improvement here (this is a real Nikon strength), and for this alone I deduct 1 star.  The high ISO noise performance is about as good as the D800--really excellent!  If you are careful with exposure (which oddly I have to bias +2/3 or the images are too dark), you can achieve extraordinary results.Autofocus: Quite good overall--fast and accurate.  It is similar to the D800 but without face detection through the viewfinder.  It is unfortunate that face detection through the viewfinder is missing; the feature appears in the Canon 1D X, actually works and seems to aid not only candid photography, but also sports/action where faces can be detected.  The detail focus on the 5D Mark III is really great, but the subject tracking is remarkably poor, bordering on unusable in my opinion.  My Nikon D300 from 5 years ago can track subjects much more reliably.Ergonomics: The camera is big, but the ergonomics are fantastic--far superior to the Nikon D300 and the D800.  Unlike the D800 that feels a bit like holding a 2x4, the 5D Mark III has a wonderful grip and thumb groove that inspires confidence.  The control layout is different than Nikon but not terribly so, and after a brief period every bit as easy to use.  The C1, C2, C3 custom modes are wonderful.  I purchased the battery grip extender and love the improved ergonomics.  I don't quite understand why the grip extender control positions don't better match the positions on the camera body, although this doesn't seem to matter much in practice.Video quality: I was prepared for good-but-mushy, alias-and-moire-free video.  What I am seeing is wonderful, bokeh-filled, full-frame goodness.  The resolution looks great to me, and while there are 3rd party firmware upgrades available (from Magic Lantern) that bring high-dynamic-range RAW video with remarkable quality, I don't think I need this; I love the look of the stock 5D Mark III video.  As a point of reference, the Nikon D800 exhibited some moire the first time I tested the video feature.Overall: Except for the rough landing with Canon lenses (all sorted thanks to Amazon), I haven't had this much fun with photography in a very long time.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "5D Mark 3 Surpasses Expectations", "Author": "CanonInBama", "ReviewID": "R34IHZCOE4Y4XU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Mk3 a little over a month ago. I have been shooting Canon since my 35mm days and have had a 20D,40D and currently a 7D before purchasing this body. I have been wanting a full frame body for a couple of years now and anxiously awaited the release of this model for the last year. I almost pulled the trigger on a Mk2 and I am so glad I waited.The build is solid and all of the controls are logically laid out. There is a change in the menu layout from the 40D and 7D, but a little time learning the settings is well worth the effort. Having all of those (61) AF points can be a little overwhelming at first, but they are fantastic for getting the composition right the first time in camera without having to set and recompose. Autofocus is fast and locks on well in low light. It was fun just playing around in ISO 10000 to 25000 just to see how dark it can be to get a decent image. I could easily use ISO 10K images with just a bit of noise reduction.Image quality in real world shooting has been amazing. I'm not sure how much to add to this at this point. I have had 2 official shoots so far and the resulting pictures were fantastic. I have a higher \"keeper\" rate than previous cameras, making it interesting selecting images to process. I have used it with my 24-70 L and 70-200 L and the results have been most pleasing.I have played a little with the in-camera HDR. It's ok, but I still prefer doing it in software.

I can't say enough things about the new autofocus system.  AMAZING. GENIUS. I rarely have eyes out of focus now.  Even my 85mm/1.2L is performing much better.  I love the colors and creaminess from that lense but focusing it was like playing a Russian Roulette game. I am enjoying this lense much more often now with the Mark iii.2. The low light ISO capabilities are extremely good and more impressive than the Mark ii.3. I love the lock on the mode dial.  I, for one, use to have frequent unsolicited mode changes from Manual to Bulb. No more of that.4.  I love the feel of the rubbery-like finish.  The camera feels better in my hand than the Mark ii.5.  LOVE the new dual card slots.DISLIKES:My one major gripe is that the autofocus point doesn't highlight in red when I press the focus button (I use back button focus).  It only highlights in red when I change the autofocus point. Otherwise, it is a dark grey/black box.  I use manual autofocus point selection consistently so I usually do not remember where it was pointing last after a few minutes and it is annoying to have to pretend to change the focus point just to see where it is set. Canon really needs to address this in the next firmware update.Oh, another thing is that when I shoot a picture, it blocks me from playback of any other photos.  I have to actually press the play button if I want to go back and compare that photo to the prior one.  The first two 5Ds did not hijack playback like this and it is kind of annoying.Oh, for all of you on waiting lists (as was I), I went to BestBuy and they had several in stock.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "More pleased with it than I thought I would be - A Video Shooter's Perspective", "Author": "matt wolfe [cc] \"-matt wolfe [cc]\"", "ReviewID": "R1EPV25VUNUXPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There's been a plethora of reviews already, addressing specs and then comparing attributes, but I thought I've give a little perspective to those who shoot similar to me.On paper, let's be honest, the 5Dmk3 doesn't seem all that more impressive than the Canon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera (Body Only), and then compared to the Nikon D800 36.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) - it looks like a perfect storm against the 5Dmk3.I typically used a pair of Canon 7D's (and sometimes a Canon XHA1 as an additional back-up against corrupt files on the 7D bodies before the 1.2.5 firmware update) to shoot video. Fine video, with a crop sensor (helped in recording speeches or wedding nuptials from the back of church, etc), didn't downconvert HDMI out to monitor to 480p like the 5Dmk2 when you pressed record. Of course there were the typical Canon SLR problems, the moire - aliasing, and the approximate 12-minute recording time limit. And of course, a 7D is only decent in low light.I recently needed to purchase some additional bodies, or camcorders, which would have:-longer record time than 12 minutes-be much better about moire - aliasing-be tapeless (I know, shame on me for being so late in making sure that even my backup is tapeless)-be better than decent in lowlight-beneficial if it could use EF lenses-would be nice if they could take good pictures (this last one was strictly because I take business pictures as a filler for cash from time to time and fill in as a second photo shooter in weddings when I'm not taking video)I used a 5Dmk2 on shoots from time to time, but had not owned one. I thought about going the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black) along with a 5Dmk2, since it seemed the differences between the mk2 and mk3 were not so great, but there was enough of a price difference to make me wonder what the big deal was.But I was also really impressed with Black Magic Design's Cinema Camera from this year's NAB show, which could be purchased with an EF mount. However, it wouldn't be released until the end of July, and I needed to purchase before June.I settled on the 5Dmk3 over the 5Dmk2+Panasonic GH2 option and the Nikon d800 option.And I'm very glad that I did.Pros:+30 minute record time (well, 29:29 - for tariff purposes, if you don't already know why the strange record limit)+Fixed moire - aliasing issue (Well, made it much better. It can still show up in certain angles with certain patterns, but I see it maybe once a wedding shoot)+clean ISO up to 3200, very usable at 6400, okay at ranges higher than that+Full-frame is just so nice, compared to crop, micro 4/3, or Black Magic Design's almost micro 4/3 chip+Much better pictures than the 7D+Headphone jack for monitoring+CF and SD/SDHC card use+Didn't have to sell my EF glass and re-invest in Nikon glass to go with a d800 or additional issues using EF lenses on the GH2 bodyCons:-Not as sharp as a d800, but usable, clean sharpness can be added in post, and far more superior in lowlight than the d800. (I recommend a d800 if you are always in a studio setting, but if you do more event or run-and-gun style shooting, the ISO range is a must)-Dynamic range doesn't seem to be as good as d800, but once again, shoot with a neutral profile, or Technicolor Cinestyle profile, and fix in post-Initial price-30 minute record time (I put it in the cons as well because some events may need continuous shooting of 30 minutes or more)-On board sound recording (I put this here because it's still not phenomenal. It's decent. And that works fine sometimes. But not all the time. Same with any SLR body, though.)To be honest, the 5Dmk3 fixes so many headaches that I was having using the 7D as my main video choice, headaches that would not have been resolved with just the 5Dmk2. The d800, which takes beautiful pictures, is a fantastic camera except in one very crucial area, lowlight. Even though it starts out with a brighter image at its low ISO levels than the 5Dmk3, the noise is atrocious as you increase ISO, even with noise-reduction software. A beautiful love affair can be had with the d800, I will say definitely say. And to all the GH2 fanboys, there are so many good things about the GH2, but it really felt like a trade-off compared to the 7D. It's like those bodies, the 7D and GH2, complimented each other greatly in that where one was weak, the other fixed, but in turn was weak where the other was strong. (If that makes sense.)I purely wanted to upgrade to fix issues. The 5Dmk3 has proven to not be deficient to where I would need the 7D, or another camera body, to fill some gap.I've had zero buyer's remorse from this purchase. And I can't say that about many purchases.Rating: 4.5 StarsPrice knocks it down to 4 StarsBut because I love using it, 5 Stars - I know, all crushes are 5 stars when they first start out... so it's really a 4 - 4.5 Star product", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "5D Mark III = Underpriced Baby 1DX", "Author": "Alex F", "ReviewID": "R14GJKD1JJ4M7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't be fooled; this is NOT an overpriced 5D Mark II upgrade.

I can safely say, after only a single day, that the 5D Mark III is like a 5D Mark II, Canon 1DX, and Canon 7D had a love affair and this is their child that only got the good genes.I've been a very happy Canon 7D owner for some time. I needed the speed of the AF and all those cross type AF points and the high fps for action shots occasionally and couldn't find anything that came close to the 7D in terms of performance. IQ was never an issue but DOF was for portrait shoots; that buttery bokeh that we love and crave was good but not exceptional regardless of beautiful and expensive L glass. Also, having to calculate in the crop factor was not that fun but I couldn't go to the 5D Mark II because of the slow fps and the slow AF. I didn't want two cameras; I wanted one... And it's here.This camera may not be targeting the 1DX community but I can promise that anyone looking at the 1DX will likely look at the 5D Mark III as a cheap baby 1DX with many overlapping features. I look at it as the camera that convinced me to just sell off my beloved 7D entirely because you can't go back. You can only go forward. This is Australopithecus; we are walking upright.I considered going to Nikon and I tried on the D800 and it's a great camera but ergonomically the 5D Mark III feels great in the hand; it's something that feels so good, you don't want to put it down. Also, the low light performance tests I've seen and what I've now experienced with the Mark III makes it the most amazing night shooter in this price range.If you buy this camera, you'll never regret it. I know everyone keeps saying that and I know I thought, \"Yeah, you didn't regret it but it's $4300... I might regret that...\" I was wrong. I'll never regret this. You'll never regret buying this.

The screen is brighter than the MKII which can mess with your perception of exposure. Call me sloppy, but I with the MKII I trusted what I saw on the screen and adjusted in post if I was off.( I shoot full manual)  With the MKIII I was a full stop or more under exposed with this first wedding for low light shots - so, if you shoot manual mode check your histogram or use a light meter until you're used to the screen.

This is exactly the upgrade I was looking for. I skipped the Mark II because canon decided to retain the AF which was a constant source of frustration in anything other than broad day light.This is a perfect upgrade for me because of the low light capability, AF, speed, customability, etc. This model corrects and improves on the feature set of the original 5D and the Mark II. So this more of an evolutionary camera not a revolutionalry one like the D800.In correcting and improving features of the the previous 2 models, canon has created a near perfect camera, but there are some cons that would prevent it from being a 10.0.Cons:1. PRICE: This is a big one. Canon decided to increase the price by $500 because they were delivering a near perfect camera. This becomes less palatable because of the release of the D800 and D800e which have a revolutionary sensor at a $500 less price.2. Disabled feature set:Metering : Canon deliberately did not include features like the metering of the 1DX unlike the D800 which has the same AF and metering as it's big brother.HDMI out : Video out quality is not high quality uncompressed unlike the D800AF linked spot metering : This is a big omission. Canon in it's infinite wisdom reserves this for only it's professional model, while Nikon has it in every model.UDMA enabled SD slot: the canon implementation is on the slower cards, the D800 has the faster UDMA SD standard.USB: canon uses the slower 2.0 standard, the D800 has USB 3.0AF assist light : would have really helped in low light.3. Sensor technology : There is essentially very little advancement from the Mark II's sensor. The D800's Sony sensor is revolutionary with incredible resolution without paying a penalty for cramming 36 MP in the same size sensor.I guess canon listened to it's user base on some issues but decided not to reward it's loyal users. This seems to be the direct opposite of what Nikon is doing. While this is disappointing to me as a Canon user for 20+ years, the Mark III camera is the first camera that is close to near perfect in ergonomics and usability. Canon missed a chance to make another legendary T90 type camera that it had done in the past.So highly recommended with some reservations (see cons).

I primarily shoot indoors and in low-light conditions and I hate to use flash (I have a 580 EX II but it is a pain to lug around and I have not mastered the use of flash). I have been taking photos under ISO 6400 and it is MUCH better than the 7D which would look very flat and grainy at ISO 3200.  I have also used it in daylight using the 70-200 2.8 IS II, wide open at running subjects and the focus is spot on, even with a calculated DOF of about 2 cm. As much praise the 7D autofocus system got, it has NOTHING on the 5D3.  The silent mode is simply amazing! The 7D silent mode was a pain to use - requiring 2 clicks and was slow to operate. The 5D3 continuous silent mode is a huge improvement and is less distracting to the subjects.Pro:1) Autofocus is wonderful. Beware that this much power and flexibility does come with a learning curve.2) Silent mode is easy to use and makes it much less noticeable/distracting.3) Low light ability is unparallelled in this price bracket4) What banding? I cannot say that it does not exist, but in the processing I have done so far, it is NOT an issue, unlike what I easily saw in the 5D2.5) Ability to adjust micro-focus on both tele and wide ends of zoom lenses.

The Test Results sections are very interesting.Keep having fun.Original Review:First let me say that I don't appreciate people who write a review on a product that they have not used.  I believe that anyone who rates the new 5D MkIII below 4 stars has not properly evaluated this camera.  It is excellent and I only have one gripe (I wish it had a simple built-in fill flash as my D700 and 7D have/had).My last two favorite DSLRs were the Nikon D700 and Canon 7D; both were excellent and worthy of a five star rating when they were introduced.  Until now the D700 was my only Full Frame DSLR but I gave it to my nephew (my nephew has become a very good photographer) after I used my 7D for several months. Because of the high cost of lens and other accessories, I have now decided to standardize on Canon.  As a side note, I plan to keep my 7D or it's replacement as I like the 1.6 crop factor for telephoto work.  The 7D body is less expensive than most good telephoto lens ( I already own the EF 100-400 ).I received my new 5D MkIII from Amazon on March 26th and have taken about 1200 shots.  What I like best about the new 5D is the quality of my pictures.  I also enjoy 2 stops + or - higher ISO performance ( vs D700 and 7D ) and at a recent Easter dinner event was able to take all my shoots w/o a flash (95% were taken inside) using f/4 lens (24-105 IS and 70-200 IS).  I used Av mode with Auto ISO ( Auto ISO set to Max range ).  I try to keep Av at f8 unless I have a depth of field, shutter or ISO issue.  The 61 Point AF worked well but I also used single-point Spot AF alot.  Auto WB was excellent.  Evaluative metering was used as my default but I used Spot metering with certain light issues.  I did not record in RAW for this family event.  I recorded Large jpegs to my CF card and small jpegs to the SD card.  Only a few shots needed a slight adjustment in Photoshop.

I'll spare you the technical aspects of the camera, because honestly, I don't think it matters that much. What is important to me is that the camera has the ability to do what you need it to, and it doesn't make it a chore to do so. It needs to remove itself from the process as much as possible so you can make the art not master how to flip switches or earn the high score at The Game of Menus.I'll preface the remainder of the review with some information about my shooting style.1. I'm a RAW only guy; I just don't think about JPG.2. I can sometimes be an IQ geek (I try not to be).3. I only shoot in manual mode... because I don't ever remember that Av and Tv exist (I've long forgotten about P and A).4. I turn off just about every setting that exists. Highlight priority, Noise reduction, long exposure comp, etc... all off.5. I usually only shoot in Expanded AF Area or Spot AF.6. I process everything through LR.Now... here's what I like about the 5D Mark III:- The 5D III has some wonderful ISO response, especially compared to my 7D. I was only marginally content up to ISO 400 on the 7D, but I'm happy with ISO 6400 on the 5D before I feel the need to apply some noise reduction (I shoot with all that off). This lets me shoot in darker places without my own light, which is great.- Handling the camera is a joy, but man does it have menus out the yingyang. Sometimes it is a bit annoying to have to go from one end of the menus to another (e.g., from Mirror Lock up to Format Card). I am glad they took Mirror Lock up out of the Custom functions... of course... there are custom functions. For that mirro lock up bit, just set a \"Tripod mode\" to one of the C's on the dial and problem solved. Easy. In my hands, I really like the 5D III w/ Grip. It's bulky and heavy. It definitely feels like a tool and not a toy. Then again... I'm one of those people that liked the original O controllers for the Xbox. I held it in a bit of a weird way, though.- The AF system is great (coming from the 7D). Now when I shoot with my 7D, I feel the same as when I used a 5D II from using the 7D's AF system. The viewfinder is oddly... bare on the 7D.- The dial lock is amazing. My 7D is always ending up in Bulb or a Custom mode (it hangs at my hip from a strap). 5D III? Never changes modes, and I surely never want it to... except for tripods, which is so rare anyway.- Images come out great (when I don't suck). This is really more a consequence of the glass on the front (and my own skills holding the camera still), but the 5D III doesn't hinder the process at all.- Very well rounded. Decent FPS (7D is faster, which is why I keep it around), great ISO response, Full Frame, great AF, and wonderful button placement. Naturally, I could go to a 1DX from the 7D, but that's a lot of money, and then I lose the \"1.6x crop factor\" (which is only a composition/FOV thing; there is no actual magnification... beyond the differences in different size and pixel pitch senors and so forth. That's all really beside the point).All in all, it's a great camera. More MP than you need, well thought out ergonomics, and so many functions. If you are looking for a Full Frame camera that isn't $6,000, this is a wonderful option. There's also the 6D, too, and they're pretty much the same thing minus some choice features. I bought this camera before the 6D came out, and I don't regret it.If you are a professional photographer, I don't really know why you are reading this review. You already know way more than I do.If you are a serious photographer looking for a good FF camera, I give this thing a thumbs up.If you are a serious [money] amateur looking for a great all around camera (or a great FF), sure, I'd wager you won't be disappointed.If you're tight on cash, buy a much cheaper camera and invest the rest in your retirement or in glass. After all, glass matters more than the camera. I've never met anyone who can look at a photo and tell me which camera it was shot with or even which brand. Lens maybe, camera definitely not.

Canon stepped away from the ridiculous megapixel wars and delivered a very capable body that is well rounded for almost any use.While most of us wanted only a 7D equivalent AF system, Canon delivered the flagship system found in the 1Dx. The AF has not missed focus for me yet that was not my own user error. Servo tracking with even the farthest outer points are extremely accurate and nail focus each and every time. You are given many options to customize the AF system perform best to the subject you are shooting, which is great. These options include AF point switching speed, delay with interruptions, how erratic the subject will be, etc... It really is excellent.Image quality is what you would expect, Amazing. I have used the 5D Mark II for about a year prior and have edited tens of thousands of images from that camera. The 5D3 images are more impressive. At low ISO's you are able to better push shadow areas and really have the ability to increase the dynamic range more then the 5D Mark II. With the 5D2 you would get shadow banding with only minor pushes in exposure along with blotching and other artifacts. The 5D3 is heavily improved in this area. Images remain noise free at low ISO, just like they always have.The high ISO performance of this camera is simply incredible. With the 7D I tried to limit my high ISO shooting to about 6400... The 5D II my limit was the same, although it did render cleaner images and much better detail then the 7D. However, at 12,800 and above the 5D2 would go downhill very quickly. I am extremely comfortable shooing up to ISO 25,600 with the 5D3. Images are still very detailed with very nice looking, fine grain. Images don't become flat looking and still have a really nice look to them. I will even shoot 51,200 without a problem, although there is a big increase of noise beyond the native ISO values. Noise is never an issue with me, as long as it is nice looking noise and detail is there. I have been surprised on how well this camera does at such high ISO. It really is impressive.The JPEG's that this camera produces are beautiful if you don't shoot RAW. But make sure to turn off all noise reduction. Remember, even \"OFF\" applies some noise reduction. This camera will make a smeary mess of your JPEG images if you leave them on. Trust me, turn them off and the images will look great. I have no problem with amazing detail and clarity with the JPEG's with them turned off.The build of the camera is really good. Solid in the hand with additional extra grip applied on the battery door. Ergonomically it just feels really good in the hand, 7D like but even better. I used a grip with my 5D2 just so it felt better in the hand and planned to do the same with the 5D3, but after using it the past few weeks I don't think I will need to. It really is a comfortable camera body to hold and shoot with.The movie features in this camera body are really well integrated, much like the 7D was. I really dig the touch-pad for volume control and other settings while recording, it really is a great tool to have. Quality of the video looks really good.This camera now has the multi-point microadjust feature to fine tune your lenses to your 5D Mark III. You now have the capability to calibrate each zoom lens on the wide and telephoto end of each lens. Very nice feature.Of course, the camera is loaded up with many other new and improved features... Improved metering system, 100% viewfinder (beautiful, by the way), improved weathersealing and locking mode dial which I really like.Of course, no camera is perfect... But Canon has got REAL close with this one. A minor gripe which may or may not be fixed with a future firmware update include the lack of exposure compensation using AUTO ISO in Manual Mode. I have been wanting this feature for a long time now... It would be so useful in complex lighting when you require a set shutter speed and aperture, but care less about the ISO. You can do this now, but the camera will always meter to \"0\". Naturally, Canon bodies seem to underexpose by 1/3 to 2/3 of a stop almost always so it would be nice to have the ability to dial in the +1/3 or +2/3 stop and have it bump up the ISO value to compensate.Overall, I think Canon really delivered an amazing replacement to the 5D Mark II... People may be a bit bitter due to the steeper price of $3499, but I think it is worth the price. You can't really think of it as a 5D2 replacement, but almost a different model. I believe Canon is developing the 5D line to be a bit more high-end, just under the flagship 1Dx. In the future I see Canon releasing a low priced full-frame option. But at this time, the 5D Mark II is still in production and can be found new for around $2,000 or used for around $1600.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "About the perfect FF camera if you shoot Canon glass", "Author": "A.

I had no way to convert the RAW files based on the computer and software I had with me in Alaska so I'll update later on the RAW files.I can't think of many cameras that have been more eagerly awaited than the new full-frame Canon EOS 5D Mark III. The Canon 5D MK II was one of the most popular DSLRs ever sold. But let's face it, it's a little long in the tooth.This may come as a surprise to many of you but I was never a big fan of the 5D MK II. I gave plenty of them away on Twitter because THAT is the camera YOU folks wanted, but as for me, well my best reaction to the 5D MK II was \"Meh.\"I think the 5D MK II was soft, slow and bulky. The AF was slow and in general, I think there are many better cameras. That said, I was in the minority and the MK II became a fan favorite - so who am I to argue with the fans? Now that the 5D MK III has shipped, the game has changed. Today I have in my hand a new, revamped camera - the 5D MK II's successor - the Mk III. All I can say is wow!Here are my initial thoughts - I am going to primarily concentrate on new features here and give a summary of my limited experience with the III. (By the way this review is based on me actually using, shooting and owning a MK III not based on the Canon press release.)Let's start with the new processor. The new, 30% faster DIGIC 5+ offers many improvements to the Canon line including better chromatic aberration correction, a multiple exposure mode and in-camera RAW conversion. There is also now in-camera HDR and 2, 3, 5 and even 7 frame auto exposure bracketing. It also allows for up to six FPS shooting which is a dramatic improvement from the MK II. In my experience all these claims proved to be true. The camera is noticeably faster.The new magnesium alloy body shell is more waterproof than the old version. It feels beefier in the hand and just a tad heavier than the II. I didn't personally test the waterproofness - but I did use the camera from a boat for a week and found no problems.I primarily tested the camera with the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II Lens both with and without a new Canon EF 1.4X III Telephoto Extender. The results were fantastic either way, but the camera was (as expected) slower to focus with the 1.4 mounted. The images are crisp and the color rendition accurate. (Thanks to Borrowlenses.com for shipping me the 1.4 TC. I forgot mine and they overnighted me one to Alaska so I could test it for this post.)The viewfinder now offers 100% coverage and is very bright - I mean REALLY bright. I like this feature because it just makes it easier to find the photograph. There are also electronic levels on display in the viewfinder and LCD. The LCD is 3.2' and less reflective than the old screen. There's a noticeable improvement in my opinion.There is a CF AND an SD slot onboard along with all sorts of improvements to the audio including a dedicated headphone jack, mic jack, and input level control (using a touch sensitive dial). Moire and aliasing problems are mostly gone.HDSLR movie shooters will love this camera since shooting video was factored into the design of the III where it was more of an afterthought on the II. There is a well-placed, video start stop button and there is less rolling shutter effect. Canon has also added SMPTE timecode recording, maximum 29:59 minute files, a better CODEC and better HDMI out options.I only shot a few minutes of video on the camera and that just to test the manufacturer claims as best I could. I do see a decrease in rolling shutter - not a dramatic decrease mind you - but noticeable. The overall video quality seems about the same to me.The autofocus has been beefed up significantly in the MK III and frankly it's about time. The 61 point AF on the new MK III is identical to the 1DX except that it does not include face detection. (Boo!) It's fast, reliable and much easier to customize than the MK II's AF. I cannot stress enough how much I like this new AF. If I had to decide on upgrading to this camera and money wasn't a factor, I'd do it on the basis of the new autofocus alone. I photographed eagles, flying erratically and straight at me and the new AF stuck with them every time. I had about a 92% keeper rate on the toughest shots - compared with about 85% on the 1D MK IV and 60% on the 5D MK II. This autofocus rocks. Period.There are other small improvements. You can now set a minimum and a maximum range in the Auto ISO and Auto ISO can now be used in manual shooting mode. One thing I really like is that Canon kept the battery the same for both the MKII and the MKIII. Since many of you have multiple MKII batteries, then you won't have to waste that investment if you upgrade. I also really like the fact that Canon didn't take the bait and increase the megapixel rate on this camera to match the D800. It isn't necessary.What I don't like? The price increase is dramatic. Those of you with less-expensive glass are going to complain about your images on the MK III because Canon reduced the thickness of the anti-aliasing filter so cheap glass will be found out quickly here. With 22 megapixels and full-frame resolution, you're going to want to limit yourself to \"L\" glass on a MK III. I also think Canon could have thrown in just a few more goodies for video shooters like peaking and focus assist. Some will also complain about the lack of an articulating screen but I don't think that is that big a deal. The eyepiece comes off VERY easily so I'm ordering several replacements since I know I'll eventually find one missing.As far as accessories go, the 5D Mark III works with a new grip, the Canon BG-E11 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 5D Mark III Digital SLR Camera. It replicates most of the main shooting controls for portrait format shooting, and can accept either two LP-E6 batteries or a tray full of AAs. Canon is also offering a new flash. The Canon Speedlite 600EX-RT Flash is the new flagship flash which comes with a guide number of 60, a fully-articulated head, zooming that now covers 24-200mm and weather sealing. If you want to shoot off camera you'll need the Canon ST-E3-RT Speedlite Transmitter to work with the new flash.NOTE: All these new accessories are very expensive. (The trio listed above will set you back about $1500!) This will no doubt influence the third-party developers to make similar, compatible devices costing less. So if you're on a budget, and can wait, you might want to wait a few months to see what companies like Pocket Wizard for instance do with the new flash and a wireless way to trigger.CONCLUSIONAt $3499, the new MK III is about one thousand dollars more expensive than the 5D MK II. Is that a good investment for YOU? It depends. If you shoot video on the DSLR then it's a no brainer. Absolutely. The video improvements in the 5D MK III make upgrading an easy decision. If you just want the best AF Canon has ever built - upgrade. The handling, interface, etc., are all improved. The camera is faster, beefier and offers a solid full stop of improvement in its already stellar low-light shooting capability. (Canon claims two stops improvement which hasn't been borne out in my early tests but I'll continue to evaluate on this front and update here if my opinion changes. I think it's about a stop better - but  it's still great low-light performance no matter how you slice it.)All-in-all I think serious shooters will want to consider this upgrade, even with the significant price increase. If you're a casual shooter or you can't afford \"L\" glass, or just don't ever plan to shoot movies on your DSLR, then you might want to stick with the 5D MK II, especially if you can manually focus.For me, the Canon 5D MK III is a keeper. Highly recommended. I can even see some wildlife and sports shooters finding this to be a good compromise if they can't afford the 1DX. It's that fast.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Low light champion", "Author": "jvdg27", "ReviewID": "R2T4CH3A0J7BAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exceptional low light DSLR.  Shows very little noise, even at high ISO.  Focus is spot on, though a little complex at first.  Paired with L lenses, this has tremendous capability to focus in very dim lighting conditions and deliver some great results.For the last three years I have shot with either a Rebel or the 7D, and my biggest complaint has been the noise that is present in low light photos.  With the 5D Mark III, this is no longer an issue.  The best part of the camera is that it can adapt to most lighting conditions, with the right user input and management of camera settings.  I prefer the natural look of photos without a flash, and it seems that in most cases the lighting conditions you shoot in are sub optimal.Color of photos it produces looks very pleasing and natural.  Though there may be some advantages to shooting RAW, my preference is JPEG for simple photo sharing and editing, and JPEG photos work great.Love the sound of the shutter, and love the fact that you can easily switch it to silent mode shooting.  It's impressively quiet.The two compromises I felt I had to make when getting this camera were (1) lack of a flip out screen and (2) lack of autofocus video.  Perhaps in future versions Canon will consider a pull out screen, and hopefully improve the focus accuracy and speed when shooting in Live View mode.  Still a big sluggish on this model.  As far as the video autofocus capability goes, it seems like it needs refining and fine tuning.  I believe some Nikon DSLR cameras have this, but I'm not sure how well it really works.  Overall I've been quite satisfied with the 5D Mark III and have not dwelled much on what I considered to be \"compromises\" (or missing features), but rather have enjoyed shooting.Most of my photography is for my children, and this is where the autofocus and low light capabilities really shine.  Other things I shoot include flowers and landscapes.The 6D may be a good alternative for some who are looking for the best budget full frame option.  Though I considered it, my concern was that the autofocus capability and limited view finder coverage of the 6D would be limiting.  It would be nice to have the 5D Mark III be a little bit smaller, though.The build is excellent.  Feels much like the 7D, but more refined.  My hands are big, so it fits me well.Lenses I use in with the camera includeCanon 24-70 L - extremely useful.  I find the wide angle quite nice.  The 24-70 on the 7D (cropped sensor) just didn't go wide enough.Canon 50 1.4 - nice and lightweight, and great when stopped down to F2 or beyond. Has great background blur.  I also have the 40mm lens but find the 50mm more useful viewing angle.  Quite tricky to shoot at F1.4 or F1.8 - most everything is out of focus.  But a fun lens.  Wish it focused better in dim lighting - seems to struggle.Canon 28-135 IS - handy walk around lens.  Use it for vacations mostly.  F5.6 on the telephoto side is a bit slow for me.  Quality of photos is good, but not really comparable to the L lenses.  Don't use this lens that much.Canon 100 IS L Macro - the viewing angle seems just right for portraiture.  Also use it for macro, of course.  Exceptional bokeh and photo quality.  Fairly lightweight.Canon 70-200 IS L II - my favorite lens by far.  Most pleasing results, and fast on focus and on performance.  Most often shoot at F 2.8 or F 3.5.  Would probably use this lens much more if it were smaller / more lightweight.  But then it probably wouldn't be F 2.8.  My wife and I call this the \"King Lens,\" and it's well deserving of that title.  Phenomenal build quality and very fast lens.I like Ken Rockwell's review of the 5D Mark III.  Read it several times before getting the camera, and I think it's a great source of information to consider if you're looking at the camera.Costs a lot.  Ouch!  I've actually been somewhat careful about where I take it, which wasn't even a thought with the 7D or the Rebel T1i.  Sometimes I wish I had a little Rebel for smaller size and portability and less liability (i.e. concern it will get lost or be stolen), but then I remind myself that I wouldn't be satisfied with the performance and photos, particularly the low light capabilities.I hope to get many years of functional and successful use with the 5D.  I considered the Mark II version, but wanted easier video controls and updated auto focus.  Glad I went with the Mark III.  I'm using the video more often than I thought, though the manual focus does take some getting used to.  And lots of practice and patience.  But when done right, it's very rewarding.By the count and quality of lenses I have, and given the 5D Mark III is pretty much a professional camera, I probably ought to be making some kind of business or money on it.  But I just use it for family photography and enjoyment.  Worth the price for something like this?  It took me about three years thinking about a full frame wondering that question.  Glad I did, if for nothing else, then for the reason that our family memories will be clear and beautiful.Though I prefer to shoot without a flash, it would be nice if Canon had a built-in flash.  Nice that Nikon does that. But not a deal breaker, just more of a nice to have.  I'm not one to like to carry around a heavy shoe flash or lighting equipment that requires you to have suitcases.  Perhaps at some point I'll look into that, but for now, I enjoy simple shooting and being able to do photography in nearly any kind of lighting with the Mark III.  That was my real motivation in going for this camera, and it's proved to be a winner.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Product - Somewhat overpriced.", "Author": "DiDot", "ReviewID": "RHDZ8VS7OKEZG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a serious amateur and debated long and hard between the 5DMKIII and the 6D -In the end I wanted to get a \"no compromise\" camera. I toyed around with the 6D and it is certainly a fantastic camera (handles well, feels comfortable to hold and creates great images). However, coming from the canon 30D, I felt more at home with control layout on the 5D3. I prefer more controls at my fingers instead of in menus. Secondly, I preferred the autofocus capability of the 5D3. I certainly do not think this warrants the price difference between the two cameras but price was not a limiting factor for me. After 3 weeks of use, this camera meets my expectations. For the price though, I wish it had the WIFI capability of the 6D - I use the EYE-FI PRO cards which works great for me -gives me both wifi and geo tagging functionality.Overall a great camera - about $500 too expensive, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I will be keeping this camera for a long time.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Initial impressions-- an AMAZING camera", "Author": "E. Lacey", "ReviewID": "R3Q9HJOTU84VRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After only having owned this camera for a couple days, I am incredibly impressed with the Canon 5D Mark III.  I am upgrading to this camera from a 30D, and while I have used a Mark II once in the past, my primary experience was with that (30D) camera.  Therefore, I will focus primarily on a couple features that this camera offers, and not attempt to compare it to the Mark II or other full-frame cameras.  Additionally, since I am primarily a stills photographer, I am not really qualified to discuss the issues of most concern to videographers, so I will leave it to another reviewer to cover those features of this camera.  Finally, years ago I made the decision to buy Canon over other vendors. My subsequent investment in glass means that I realistically cannot switch systems at this point.  I am not a Canon zealot and recognize that Nikon (and Sony, Fugi, etc.) all have great cameras. I chose this Canon because it was the upgrade path for me to continue to use my lenses, not simply because it was Canon.Taking the camera out of the box, it feels very good in my hands.  It is very well balanced, has excellent \"grip\" and is molded nicely to fit my thumb on rear panel.  I do not have very big hands and the size of this camera is just about at the limit of what feels comfortable to me.  The buttons are laid out in a manner similar with most of the other Canon prosumer models, with some new buttons and some rearrangement as well.  Canon put some thought into the button placement, and, while it will take a bit to get used to new layout, I think that the changes made work very well. For example, the set of buttons along the left side of the rear display are nicely arranged to be image review functions (erase, play, zoom, and the new \"rate\" and \"creative photo\" buttons), while the right side of the display is dedicated to \"before you click\" functions.  Newly added to the 5D series is the Q button that is finding its way on other Canon DSLRs, giving you a the ability to select and adjust camera settings all from the rear panel.  At first I was didn't think that I would use this, since I am accustomed to using the other buttons for adjustment, but I have come to like that feature now.This being my first full-frame sensor body, that alone would be reason to upgrade.  However, I chose the Mark III instead of the Mark II for a few key reasons-- the pro-level focusing system, the improvements in ISO performance, and the improved weather sealing.  As mentioned, I only had limited experience with the Mark II, but one of the things I didn't like was the small number of focus points (given the cost of the body), and the fact that they were really squished into the middle ~40% of the viewfinder.  I was psyched when I learned that the focusing system from the 1DX was being added to this camera.  It seemed like it could be cumbersome to use (the 61 available on the 5d Mark III is a big step up from the 9 on my previous camera), but it is really simple to select the focusing method (using the multi-function button) as well as select the focus point(s) (using both the main dial and the quick control dial).  The result of these added focus points is a system that is very quick to lock focus, and very accurate. The high number of single and dual cross-point sensors really benefits the photographer.The ISO performance is no less impressive.  The Mark II already was a great performer at high ISO, and the Mark III is even better. Stunning, nearly noiseless results all the way to ISO 6400.  And still incredible results all the way to ISO 25600.  Given that you can set the top end of the auto-ISO value set by the camera, you can *almost* leave the camera on auto-ISO with 6400 at the top end.  I say almost because you can see some minor noise creeping in at 6400 when viewing shots taken in low light and viewed at 100%.  Given better lighting conditions, you truly get EXTREMELY usable images directly from the camera all the way to 25600, and with a bit of post processing, those very high ISO photos look great as well.A few other things that I really like about this camera... The view finder is huge (perhaps only because I was shooting with crop-sensors in the past) and bright.  The camera is very configurable, from changing the behavior of the buttons to the amount of focus data to display in the view finder, setting servo tracking parameters, it really can be individualized to suit your needs and manner of shooting.  Also, I love the rear monitor as well-- very bright and crisp.  And, while I know that video shooters will not be happy that the monitor does not flip out, given that this was done to improve the weather sealing of the camera, that was okay with me as well.There is so much more for me to discover with this camera that I have not had a chance to as yet.  I am interested in seeing how good the HDR feature works, as well as the multiple exposure feature.  And, I am interested in playing with the creative photo features as well.  All in good time...  As I learn more about this camera, I will continue to update this review.The Canon 5D Mark III is an incredible camera.  However, it also comes at a pretty incredible price.  $3500 is a steep hill to climb for any camera, and when compared to the less expensive, higher MP Nikon 800, it might appear that Canon got this to market just a few months too late.  Time will tell if that is the case.  In my opinion, however, Canon has done a great job at balancing image size and image quality with the Mark III, and, for me, this camera is worth the price.  The upgrades over the Mark II are significant, and the resulting images are truly amazing.  I can certainly understand those who would opt instead for the (now much less expensive) Mark II and a great lens for the same total cost-- the Mark II is also a great camera.  However, if you do decide to get the Mark III, I believe that you will LOVE this camera, and won't regret the investment for one second.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "5D Mark III vs. the 6D", "Author": "Brandon Lee", "ReviewID": "R3T9VMAB7O1OW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are on the fence between the 5D Mark III and the 6D, perhaps my experiences will help:This is the second 5DIII I've purchased and I've also owned the 7D, 6D and 70D (all of which I've sold to fund this beast). Take it from someone who has lost hundreds of dollars buying a 5DIII, then selling it for a 6D, and then selling the 6D for a 5DIII again after realizing how much I really missed the 5DIII; there is simply no comparison when it comes to AF performance, unless you are willing to spend twice as much on a 1DX, which also has the same AF system as within the 5DIII!So if you are trying decide between the 6D or 5DIII and you already have some good glass first and foremost (AND you can afford either), seriously...just buy the 5DIII. You won't regret it. If you plan on using the outer AF points instead of just the center one (especially for fast glass, like the 85 f/1.2L II), it's a no-brainer...the 5DIII wins hands down. However, if you are willing to compromise and rely mostly, if not solely, on the center AF point and just crop as needed, then by all means save yourself a few hundred bucks and go with the 6D, and use the remainder for some other photographic goodies, such as the aforementioned 85L or 24-70 f/2.8L II (both are stunning combinations)! The image quality differences between the two are negligible at best, so it really comes down to the static features (or lack thereof) that they offer and your particular needs:5DIII - more robust body, superior AF system, faster X-sync speed, dual card slots, RAW video w/ Magic Lantern, etc.6D - smaller and lighter body, center cross-type AF point sensitive to -3 EV (but only the center point), allows interchangeable focusing screens for improved manual focusing, etc.I hope this helps.

D800 has much better dynamic range (because of the Sony Sensor) and better low ISO performance.However, if you want to find an all around camera, 5d mark iii is probably the best choice other than some other more expensive options.I am very happy that I upgraded myself to this camera.I am looking forward to seeing Canon coming up with a high mega-pixel camera with better DR.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid upgrade to a great camera", "Author": "J.

Both are great cameras but the Mark iii came with a few more bells and whistles.The 6D has great low light noise performance but I found it does start to lose sharpness as the ISO increase, faster than the Mark iii. The main downfall with the 6D is the 11 point AF system, even though the center focus point was extremely sensitive (-3ev I believe). I thought this wasn't a big deal, being that I did't shoot sports anymore. I started to shoot more weddings and the AF kept up but didn't provide the performance I was hoping for. I also wished the 6D had dual card slots because I always like to back up my images when shooting important events. Don't get me wrong, the 6D is an amazing camera and will produce excellent images. I just advise thinking long and hard about whether to save a little longer and the get mark iii. I wish I had.I've now had the Mark iii for about three weeks or so and I already love it!

But when I *must* get shots, either for an assignment or when I'm doing serious personal work, I usually reach for the Mark III.  The camera is close to flawless in its operation.Ergonomics are absolutely excellent.  The camera is large, easy and comfortable to hold on to, and the layout makes sense.  I know where all the necessary buttons are without taking my eye from the viewfinder.  Build quality is excellent; this camera can take abuse.  Functionality is well thought out, and all commands are extremely responsive.  Nothing lags, and nothing is fiddly or difficult to operate accurately.The AF system is top notch; you will get more keepers in tough situations if coming from anything except maybe something like a 1D Mk. IV.  It is extremely customizable and you'll want to read Canon's separate instruction book on the AF system that can be found online.  (It's written for the 1DX, which has the same AF system with a few exceptions.) I've found that metering is good, although I personally feel it under exposes by about 1/3-2/3 EV in most conditions.Image quality is excellent.  The only complaint I could level at the sensor is that the shadows can't take that much abuse in post production; you don't always get a ton of good detail when pushing.  This becomes more of an issue at higher ISO's.  Otherwise the files are beautiful and wonderfully detailed.  Noise performance is excellent, and I usually don't even bother with noise reduction in post unless I'm shooting at ISO 3200 or above.  I'm comfortable using this camera at 6400, and 12800 is good enough if you need it.  (Quite frankly you could shoot at 25600 if you're just doing shots for the web or small prints, with light post production.)  This is quite impressive, honestly, and the ability to shoot at 3200 with impunity is a boon to those who do a lot of low/lousy light work like myself.One last word of advice:  Read the manual.  Twice.  The Mk.

Without a full frame body, it 's hard for me to justify the purchase of this lens since the focal length would be too long for portrait and I would not enjoy that background isolation effect without a narrower depth of field from a full frame body. Thirdly, images captured from the EOS 7D are only acceptable up to ISO3200. Beyond that, it gets pretty noisy. The 5D Mark3 is now my \"night rider\".When I mounted my EF 24mm F1.4L II USM lens on my brand new 5D Mark3 the first time, the images it captured were like OMG! Super sharp with great tonality. I finally can fully utilize this premium lens. Having been using the EOS 7D, the 5D Mark3 feels right at home. The auto focus system is fantastic. It even has more horizontal coverage area than the EOS 7D. The menu and handling are superb, although I am still wondering why there is no dedicated mirror lock up button. And what 's up with the dedicated RATE button? I don't quite understand. I took the 5D Mark3 for a spin in the back country. and let me tell you, this is an awesome piece of equipment. I have never come across a camera this good even though I have been tempted numerious times by the dark side.Overall the 5D Mark3 is extremely responsive. It 's a bit heavy but not to the point where it breaks your neck. I would suggest replacing the standard issued Canon strap with a comfy third party one. The lack of built-in flash does not bother me. I 'd probably get the 90EX with built-in wireless remote trigger. The battery can even be shared with the EOS 7D. How nice! I don't have to get additional spares.Before I bought the EOS 5DMark3, I actually had looked into the EOS 6D which was about a grand cheaper. However, I have been spoiled by the AF system of my EOS 7D. So when I tried out the EOS 6D at Best Buy, I was somewhat disappointed. Also its body is quite a bit smaller and it did not perfectly fit into my hands. Out of the three cameras mentioned, the body size of the EOS 7D has the nicest fit for me. The EOS 5D Mark3 is slightly wider and taller. However, I still don't feel fatigue after handling it for a long period of time. I also like the sound of the shutter and the relatively lack of vibration when the mirror is flapped. The silence mode is great. I think it should be featured in all future Canon cameras.Let 's see. I have not tried video yet. But I don't expect it to be that much difference from my EOS 7D. I rarely use my EOS DSLRs to shoot video. The multi-exposure blending and HDR mode are welcome features. There 's nothing I really dislike about the EOS 5D Mark3.

I've been shooting Leica RFs for the better part of 10 years so I have grown up basically shooting in manual mode since I started getting into photography.  My kids are getting older now and my RF just can't keep up with the speed of their sports now so I had to make the plunge into DLSRs.  Apparently I came into it at a good time with the 5DMIII and D800E releases.  I did a lot of research and in the end I chose Canon for the following reasons:1) I need speed so I was drawn to 6fps as well as the quality of ISO sensitivity at 3200/64002) I wanted a camera that is super easy to set up and adjust on the fly (wash between the Nikon and Canon)3) I was drawn to the silent option on the Canon - it is incredibly subtle.4) I liked the quick C1-C3 dials for customization of the camera.  Nikon has it but it is awkward to use.5) I wanted a walk around lens and the 24-105 just felt a heck of a lot more solid than the Nikon 24-120 - the Nikon felt super cheap and the double barrel would definitely be become a problem in terms of durability and shooting in the rain; which tends to happen a lot in Seattle.I am impressed.  I love the flexibility of this camera and I the image quality is excellent.  I am definitely a perfectionist when it comes to image sharpness and I only shoot RAW so I tend to be a bit of a pixel peeper.  While the 36MP was impressive on the D800E, in the end, I realized that when it comes to shooting the kids, family and friends, the Canon gave me more versatility.  I also found the video capabilities to be pretty good even though I rarely use it.All in all, for $4500 bucks, this camera kit is a good value for what you get. The 24-105 lens is very good especially considering that this is a kit lens.  I had it out this past weekend shooting casual shots and the image quality is very sharp across the entire frame.  The fit and finish is also very good.  My M9 is still the preferred camera when I am out and about but I am genuinely impressed and surprised by the capability of the 5DMIII.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "BEST CAMERA EVER!!", "Author": "Rimmit", "ReviewID": "R2NNONNKCQIYJI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just to give a little background about myself and uses.  I have owned over the years a 20D, 40D, 50D, 7D, 5D, 5dMkII and now the ultimate camera of all time... the 5D Mark III!!!!Holy cow!  This is an amazing camera.  First off:1.) Build:  The 5d Mk II while being an amazing camera never felt like a tank to me.  It always felt like it had just a little bit of give. Especially around the CF compartment door. When you picked it up, there was always a little bit of give in it, where you could just feel it move a little.  Not anymore.  The new door feels solid, and when you hold it in your hands, it feels great.  The rubber grip over the door makes a huge difference.  The whole camera feels solid. The way the back wheel clicks. The way the on/off clicks.  It just feels like a REAL camera.  Almost a like a 1D that has just had it's bottom chopped off. You just have to feel it to believe it.  Making the dial have to have a button to move is a nice feature. I can't count how many times I would rush from location to location to get a shot and from where it would rub on my side it would change my dial from AV to M or something else.  The new M.Fn. button is nice as well to have an extra button near the trigger to change AF modes.  I do find that the trigger on this to be more sensitive but not a deal breaker.  The 100% view finder makes a bigger difference than you would think.  It is bright and expansive.  The added SD card slot is nice, but I don't use it, as I don't feel like buying more memory cards so I cannot comment on this extra feature.2.) AF:  Sooo.... This is the #1 reason I chose to upgrade, as is the reason for most of you. After having shot 40,000 shots on my Mark II, I know what to expect from it's AF.  Well this cameras AF is not even in the same galaxy as the 5d II.  I actually turn off the AF points now, as there are a whopping 61 of them!!!  Compared to 9 before, it's like being in heaven.  It's like a wall of AF points!!  ALL of which are actually usable!!  I have taken it for a test run on my dogs at the dog park and my 20 month old son.  WOW!!!!!!  Before I was lucky to have 40% keepers at best.  Now I'm up near 80-90%.  The AF Servo is phenomenal.  I tested it out in my dark bedroom using only some TV lighting focusing on my blinds and corners of desks that were BEHIND the TV so there was no direct light and after a bit of searching would actually get a LOCK!!  With my old 5d II the chance of that was a whopping 0.  It would hunt for days!  I tortured the AF, and it can find a lock nearly everytime, even with the far most AF points most of the times. Worth the money for the AF alone!  I was using a 35mm f/1.4 for the record.  The dark AF point that has been widely talked about is quite annoying I must say.  Not having it light up, esp. in the dark, makes it very difficult to locate at times.  If I still did wedding photography this could be an issue.  If they have a firmware fix to fix the problem, this will be the perfect camera.  Don't let this deter you from buying the camera.  It's a nuisance, and I can live with it, and during the day it's not a problem at all.3.) IQ:  I would say I'm getting about a 1.5 stop improvement in iso noise.  At 1600 I don't even think twice. Might as well be 400 in most cases.  At 3200 and 6400 it's a little more of a push, but still tolerable with some NR.  Compared to the 5d II I wouldn't even try for 3200 unless I was completely desperate.  I didn't really buy it for the IQ improvements, but a nice added bonus.  I didn't want a bigger MP camera as I don't want to buy more memory cards so I was happy with the minimal MP improvement.  Other's might not be, but 22.3MP is enough for me.  The image quality is what you would expect from a full frame camera, so in other words spectacular.  Nothing really else to say there.  I do not use JPG so I cannot comment on in camera processing, but I hear the NR is a little excessive and there is some detail loss rather than if it was done in post processing.  That is not from first hand experience, however.4.) Menus:  Menu system is much easier to navigate, and I love the fact that I can get a 1:1 magnification instantly now with the push of one button on review to check for focus, which is almost always spot on. =)  Just saves time.  The side by side comparison and rating system is nice. Helps me reduce the number of shots for processing later.  Just a nice added bonus.  The AF options are aplenty. It's a little intimidating coming from the AF menus of the 5d II.  After playing around with them, and reading some, it's not too hard to grasp.  The AF micro adjustment is back and can be set for tele and wide.  In all honesty, the pics I've gotten so far are so spot on, I haven't felt the need to tamper with it, like I did on my 5d II.  Maybe it's the AF, so who knows.5.) Video:  I don't use video much so I can't really remark on this feature.6.) Overall:  Quite possibly the best camera per weight I've ever touched.  This is everything I've ever wanted in a camera.  The 1dx is I'm sure better, but from a weight perspective, this is a dream camera for me.  Get this camera. You won't regret it.  When it was first announced people felt that it was a marginal upgrade, and people were disappointed. Well, once you try out the AF, and actual use this camera, it's no longer a \"minor\" upgrade.  It is the king of cameras now.  I have used a a 1D Mark IV on a semi regular basis and I prefer this camera to it.  I feel that the AF is slightly better, but I have not done in field direct comparison testing.  Plus it is lighter weight.  The 1D IV can start to weigh you down after a while.  I can't imagine a reason to upgrade to the 5d IV when it comes out.... except maybe if I can shoot 51200 without any noise. =)", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bought it for the AF, but got a whole lot more!", "Author": "D.

There's little doubt the sensor capabilities of the 5D and 5D2 are simply excellent.  However, like many users of the series, we all tend to share a common gripe. The AF system - specifically the outer focus points of the previous generation - were, shall we say, capable of giving the photographer ulcers in addition to nervous breakdowns?  I can't tell you how many times I'd see a shot, compose, line up to take it with an outer focus point in decent lighting, only to have the AF system sail past the subject and miss the shot.  And just like that, the moment's gone.No more! I'm glad to say that Canon listened and pratically went over board with the AF system on the 5D3.  Even in the crummiest of lighting - practical darkness - with little contrast between the subject and the background and I'm hitting the focus nearly everytime.  Shots the 5Dc or 5D2 couldn't see with the \"good\" center focus point -all without the AF assist beam!  Its like Canon took the very good AF system of the 7D and hyped it up with steroids and sonar - it's that good!  There was no way they were going to let the AF system handicap this camera - and they've succeeded.For me personally, I would have been happy with the 5D2 plus a great AF, and I got that with the 5D3.  But there's so much more.  Silent shooting is so quiet you can barely hear the shutter, the high ISO capabilities are mind numbing, I'm hardly seeing any noise at all at ISO 2000, some at 3200, and then it becomes noticable (but useable) all the way to 12,800.  And it cleans up well in LR4.So at the end of the day it comes down to two things; - according to me and based on *most* of the reviews out there on the 5D2 -1.  The AF system has been so vastly improved its like going from a Tercel to a Ferrari - no longer will a pro canon shooter be handicapped by a subpar AF system.2. The ISO capabilities - which were good before on the 5D2, now they're just ridiculous.If you've ever wanted to throw your 5D2 into the sea because the outer focus points failed you or if you shoot weddings in crummy light, then get on the waiting list, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "freakin' LOVE this thing!", "Author": "Jerry Wilcox", "ReviewID": "R10T9NDIVFWPJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I made the (huge) leap from the 40D to this 5DM3 and cannot believe how well this does, especially in Low-Light.

Everybody talks about the big things, so I thought I would try to focus more on the little things you don't read about as much. I'll hit on the big things first and get into the little things after. The recommendation is simple and short: is this body worth it as an upgrade from a 7D or a 5D II.This camera is substantially improved in the autofocus system of the 5D II! But lesser so relative to the 7D. The 7D is likely good enough to not require an upgrade to this camera for this feature, but this is a revolutionary upgrade over the 5D II. Having all the points is so convenient, and almost all of them are as accurate as the center point of the 5D II. One advantage over the 7D autofocus system is the level of customization possible with shutter priority and servo methods.The ISO range and noise performance at high ISO is much better than both the 7D and 5D II. This is a feature that I would recommend upgrading for. Images are usable for publication at 12800 after noise reduction and sharpening for small enlargements. 25600 ISO on the 5D III is pushing it, but for 8 X 10 prints, the quality is good enough to make sellable prints.Weather sealing is better than both the 7D and the 5D II. The battery grip is more stable and integrated with the 5D III than either of the other camera bodies I have used. Canon did a great job with making the battery grip feel VERY solid on the 5D III. This was actually one point that not many people comment on but I really appreciated. It almost feels as uniform as the vertical grip on the 1D X - yes, it's that firm with the body. I really liked that.The shutter speed is 2 frames faster than the 5D II and 2 frames slower than the 7D. It's right in the middle between the two.A smaller difference that isn't usually mentioned is how much better the depth of the hand grip is. The camera handle actually comes out a little further, which means my fingers wrap around the handle much better. I really like that because I feel like I have a more solid hold on the body with heavy lenses than I did with either the 7D or the 5D II.There is the addition of a multi-function button next to the shutter, and the 5D III is more customizable in general than either the 7D or the 5D III. The customization ability is probably the least spoken about benefit of upgrading to the 5D III from the 7D and 5D II.Is the 5D III worth the upgrade for the price? I think it depends on what you are going to use it for. The 7D was always best considered the enthusiast action camera and the 5D II was always considered the enthusiast studio camera. I think the 5D III could replace both of these as a combined enthusiast action and studio camera. I have to be careful about saying that however - the 5D III is really a professional tool, not an enthusiast camera. I think the 5D III performs best as a studio camera, but it can do well as an action camera. The level of performance is in some ways on par with the 1D series, but missing some of the advanced technology in the 1D X like the improved metering system and the metering-autofocus integration. Upgrading from a 7D for action photography? I would upgrade to the 1D X instead of the 5D III, unless you want to do more studio work than action photography. Upgrading from the 5D II is an easy recommendation to spend the money and upgrade. The low noise performance, improved dynamic range, added versatility, and customizable options make the 5D III an easy upgrade from the 5D II and worth the price.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "5D3, worth it!!", "Author": "C. luong", "ReviewID": "R3818XJ81BLKE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a photo enthusiast, not a pro.

But as the 7d gets above 3200 or 6400, I would have to do more post processing, images were too grainy, and lost a lot of details. In certain cases, images were unusable.

My start into digital photography was a fluke, and in the intervening years I have become increasingly passionate about this hobby but know I never will seek to do this professionally. I chose Canon simply because I was first exposed to it, and not because I have deep-seated convictions it is \"superior\" to Nikon. I have used some Nikon equipment and find it to be very high performing and exceptionally suited to photography. I am more familiar with the Canon menu system, and having used it for a number of years, I feel I have come to understand the layout and functionality of the menu system, which is important for on-the-fly changes to settings.I own a Canon camera with an APS-C, two film slr cameras (Pentax), and now the 5d Mark III.I love this camera. I admit to having a bit of techno-lust, but this camera has was worth every single penny to me, because I love the images I've been able to produce with it.The larger sensor size on the Mark III makes it roughly equivalent to 35mm film. The ISO range is large (50 to 102,800), and low-light performance is solid. Images still have very high detail at 1600, and the camera produces very acceptable images at 6400 ISO. Images produces at 12,800 are still solid, as there is still a lot of detail though noise does enter the picture.The auto-focus system is tremendous. Having gone from 7 auto focus points on my previous model to a fast and response 61 point system has helped nail focus in dark environments. It is fast and very responsive, and the ability to switch to a precise auto-focus point with one touch is a real boon. Customizable menus and the ability to change functions from factory default to specialized functions has really made this camera a joy to use. With my old camera, I sometimes felt limited or frustrated in what could be accomplished; with the Mark III I often find myself saying, \"it can do that, too? Oh man... how cool is that?\"I travel frequently (and often in harsh environments), so the weather sealing and rugged body is a real plus for me. My old camera looks like it's been fed to the dogs but it still keeps going, the Mark III feels like it is built like a tank in comparison, so I have fewer qualms about taking it out into rougher weather or dirty environments. I prefer landscapes and street photography, so the wider sensor suits my style. The ergonomics are preferable (for me, at least) to the smaller APS-C styled bodies, but the rugged build does come at a significant weight disadvantage, as this weighs roughly 50% more than my other body. When coupled with a heavy lens, it can be a burden to drag around on a long day.Even still, it is a joy. The silent shutter mode is a HUGE advance, as it makes street photography much more practical. You can snap a pic and be on your way before your subject even registers the camera.EDIT:I've had this now for over a year, and I've just fallen completely in love with its capabilities.  It's making me a more adventurous photographer as it is making me push the boundries of my photography as it presents options that I didn't even know where there.  In camera HDR is a gimmick but produces useful images.  Multiple exposures are fun, and a nice feature.  But what really has blown me away with this is the level of control I have over my images.  I find more and more that I am able to dial in settings on the fly to get the image \"right\" in the camera, reducing post processing time.Since you can write RAW and JPEG, you've got files ready for transfer and the originals for playing with.This camera will age gracefully.  It has withstood lots of abuse already and still looks great.  The weather sealing has been a boon.

Its low performance has opened up so many new natural light opportunities - not just indoor events, but woodland and forest scenes that formerly demanded tripods and slow shutter speeds are now possible.  Creatively, you can choose between those 'frozen' waterfalls in the redwood forest - or the creamy look of the long exposures.  Choice is good.The other thing I noticed is that I'm applying less sharpening to my images.  This applies to RAW images - I'm not sure why.

It looks sleeker and handles better and is more weather-proof- Boosted ISO (although I haven't tested 102,400 if we're being honest)- Exposure compensation has been greatly increased (+-5!!!)- FPS is now at 6, which for any wedding/sports/action photographer is a HUGE plus- The AF system is much faster and more accurate (the old system was EIGHT yrs old!)- 29.97 and 23.976fps video modes are beautiful - just wonderful!- 4GB file partitioning up to 30 minutes!!!

Not all of them will make you a better photographer, and I would highly advise not running out to purchase this as an upgrade to the 5D MkII JUST because you want the latest technologies.  That said, some of the improvements made such as the 6FPS shooting and the video improvements make this a fine successor to the MkII and indispensable to photographers and indie film-makers alike. The CF and SD slots are fantastic, as I currently own a 1DS-MkII which uses this same system. This means that in camera I can shoot to CF, back up to SD and then use the CF to dump the cards to my computer as transfer rates are higher! This will also save you money, as SD cards are a good deal cheaper nowadays, and will still make fine backup cards!As a wedding photographer, having a reliable camera is extremely important, so the 150,000K shutter rating is a huge load off of my back. Coupled with 6FPS, I feel a lot more confident that I will get the shot every time. I don't snap a million pictures a wedding, but I do like to shoot burst during the important moments, and the new fps rate will do quite well!Regarding the one con, is it just me or does this seem too \"gimmicky\" for a pro-sumer camera? I tried the mode out and it wasn't ground-breaking, I get much better results creating HDR photographs manually with post-editing. Call me old fashioned, but I had the same issue with the Pentax Medium Format DSLR that I rented recently...I just find it lacking and unnecessary.If you have the cash and are looking for a full frame with video capabilities, this is an excellent choice with the improvements made.

I primarily shoot video and not so much with photos. I just want to highlight some key rounds on why I chose this camera over Nikon, which a lot of people who come here are probably debating.I had high hopes for this camera. The II which came out in '08 was already an exceptional camera and people were comparing it to RED, so naturally I thought the III would be all that better. Canon did fix what the II had deficiencies on, but it didn't really take any great leaps to continue with furthering its strong suites, which I think holds it back in some categories that Nikon now surpasses in.Here are a few things that Nikon D800 does well better than 5dIIIBetter latitude/dynamic range (especially in photos) You can actually pull out detail, color information and gamma in shadows taken in RAW that you can't do with the 5dIII. In fact, if you try to do so with the 5dIII, you get heavy noise and artifacts.It is sharper in terms of video (out of camera). The out of camera video remains much sharper and has greater detail than the 5dIII. When I shot with the 5dIII it looks very fuzzy and very soft. But I do think this is in direct correlation to why the 5d has better moire and anti-aliasing than the d800.  This becomes apparent when I sharpened the image in post and the detail and sharpness came back but I got more aliasing and moire . So I think Canon did this in mind that this was the trade off for the low moire and aliasing.I think the D800 just takes better overall photos in general.Here is a few things that the 5d III does better than Nikon D800First off, I explained that there was an issue with the softness of the video. Well all this can be corrected if you just run it through some software and sharpen the video. It looks more comparable to the D800.The 5d is faster than the D800 in terms of FPS and how fast and accurately it focuses in on the subject.It is all around better in low light, better ISO performance and doesn't go to the extremes that D800 goes through by making the ISO steps less dramatic.Better ergonomics.  Feels like you're gripping a military weapon that was designed in mind that someone would need to express a comfortable feel when shooting.Allows for editing and post work in Video shot.  The d800 doesn't fair well when you try to sharpen it and the 5d performs better in post for video. The opposite is true for photo though.And here are a few of the intangible observations that I came up with.  The 5d III has excellent battery life and far surpasses the D800 in battery longevity.  The battery lasted for maybe 3-4 hours of shooting video and idling when I did my shoot. When I used an older Canon 60d, the battery life was about just an 1 hour of the same activity I was putting it through. The D800 is about just an hour of battery time for the same out of work.  The second one that nobody mentions is the codec.  The 5d III uses a very advanced codec that compresses the files so they take up almost nearly no space on your flash drives.  I shot with the 60d last year and it was gobbling up maybe 32 gigs per 45-50 mins.  Whereas the 5d III uses about 3 hours maybe a bit more on the same amount of storage. I was completely surprised and I bought way more SD drives than I needed because I just remembered how fast they were running out in the last shoot.  You can choose from two. They are all-i and the IPB.  One is used primarily for editing while it uses more storage space, but the other uses less storage but is less indusive to editing (as Canon lists). But from my own experience, I thought the IPB performed very well in my editing suite.  The D800 eats through storage space very recklessly and doesn't use a very efficient codec system.Here is the final breakdown that I would recommend.Go for D800If you need a Video camera to shoot studio shots in a controlled environment where lighting isn't an issue.Go for D700If you don't care at all about Video and all you care about is photos.  Seriously the D700 is the best thing out right now and it just got a lot cheaper. If I wasn't a video professional, the D700 would be my pick if video wasn't my concern.Go for 5dIIIIf you shoot video in outdoors settings or indoors with bad lighting and you have no control of the environment. This is especially great for a rogue documentary filmmaker.This is just a short brief detail of what I think of these cameras. I don't hate or like Nikon or Canon. I am partisan to both and only care about performance. So with that being said, you should buy the camera that suites the type of shooting you need.What really won me over was the battery life and how i never have to worry about running out of storage. I shoot in long shoots and just need the extra security.  And I have 4 batteries to boot and 200 gigs.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow, I love it!", "Author": "MikeDaytona675", "ReviewID": "R1MGEPGQJGLJJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Canon 7d the day it came out and loved it.  I didn't know what I was missing in a full frame.First off, some people will not like the pictures this camera takes without post processing.  You might ask why, as this camera has in camera processing, excellent resolution, great noise reduction and amazing color.  Well, those are all the \"problems\".  This camera is so good, it shows every blemish on the subject.  Every mark, every wrinkle, every strand of hair and every spec of dirt will be in the picture.Now that we got past that part, lets talk full frame.  Some people like the crop factor of the smaller sensors, especially on telephoto.  I was one of them.  I was psyched to have the ef-70-200mm L IS on my 7d as it was like having a 320mm at the long end.  What I learned was I am not losing anything in zoom with the full frame, but gaining more of the picture on the short end. If I crop the picture on the 5DM3, I can \"zoom\" in on the picture to any point I want and the resolution is so good, it actually looks much better overall.There is truth in the fact that you don't need a billion megapixels to make a good image.  The sensor is larger, so you would think you would want more mp overall, but the larger pixels gather more light, reduce noise and are just sharper.What I found is that I told myself that my crop sensor was awesome because I have all L glass and the pictures looked amazing. Then, when I paired that same glass with the full frame, I find it hard to want to pick up the 7d again.So, let me sum it up.  The 5DM3 is an amazing camera and I am not a good enough photographer to make use of all of the features and awesomeness Canon put in my hands.  Its not all about the equipment, I know people that shoot amazing shots with a point and shoot, but for me, it is one more cool tool in the tool box.5 Stars from me.  I love my 5DM3.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Written from the perspective of Moving from the MkII to the MkIII", "Author": "M. Russo \"mitchrusso\"", "ReviewID": "RIA1HDCU70UZ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my review as a landscape photographer. Upfront you should know that I don't shoot video. I realize there are many video upgrades but I wouldn't have a use for them in my current work. That's not covered in this review.When the MkIII first was announced, it was about $500 more than it is now. And on paper, I decided that for the quality differences in my actual images, it would not be worth the upgrade. I felt content in my analysis and went on happily using my MkII for several more months in which I logged thousands of frames and make several new additions to my portfolio, which you can see at LensTraveler18 and at this moment all images in the last 3 years are from the MkII. This winter, I traveled to Jordan with a group of photographers and met a guy who went through the same thought process I did. He gave me a complete tour of the new features and I was blown away with the improvements made by Canon.After the recent price drop, which brought the MkIII within about $500 more than what I paid for the MkII, I decided to make the purchase. I am thrilled that I did.I just returned from Iceland and used both cameras and started to notice differences that make my experience more enjoyable and my images \"better\" from my perspective. I will try and explain what I found and why those changes were important to me.This is a complete overhaul, upgrade and enhancement of the MkII.There are no similarities except the size of the sensor physically and the number of megapixels which is roughly the same as the MkII. So to consider this an upgrade is misleading.The body is shaped differently yet almost completely familiar to the MkII user, and the menu structure is an enhanced version of the MkII. It's VERY enhanced.The Canon \"Experience:\"If I were to summarize what I realized and what's been said over and over here in the forums is that Canon actually listened to users carefully and implemented nearly every suggestion for improvement, and there are many. I cannot say enough about Canon and Canon Professional Services (CPS,) who are the repair and service arm of Canon. Nikon readers should tune out here, I suspect you will be disappointed.  Before I left for Iceland, I had my 5dMkII cleaned and adjusted by CPS, it took 3 days, the camera came back better than it was before and I had a long conversation with the service rep who explained what was found and what was done to my camera. Side note: I slipped and smashed a 17-40L zoom to smithereens. I spent 5 minutes picking up the pieces so I wouldn't litter. I put all the pieces into a box and shipped it to Canon. They charged me under two hundred and returned a perfect, tested lens. That's what you get with Canon.Features:With the MkIII, autofocus has been enhanced so much that it's practically telepathic. The problem is that so much new functionality is built in, the learning curve on the autofocus system itself is substantial. You can just use it like you did on the MkII and it's 1000% better but there's so much it can do. I cared about that, I was thrilled to see how heavily it was enhanced.The AEB (autoexposure bracketing) system now matches Nikon in allowing for 3, 5 and 7 frames, with 1/3 to 2 stops between each frame and with full offset. For HDR types, this is a huge improvement and very welcome. The memory card management system now accepts two cards, one SD and on CF, and you can separate which image types goes to which card or use them as backup. I realize Nikon's high end cameras had this before so it's catchup here too. But very welcome.There are two new \"functions\" which are useful and one of them is AWESOME. The camera can now shoot HDR and process 3 frames into a single Jpg image. I have no use for this since I do everything in software but many people will really enhance their results with this new feature. The other new function is \"multiple exposure\" shooting which I haven't had since my film days. Yes, I am that old. I had some fun with it this past weekend and I am thrilled it's there.Virtually ALL buttons are definable and a new \"Q\" button has been added. I think it was on other Canon models but not on the MkII. I have already become so used to it, I almost can't imagine working without it.The processor upgrade shows up as faster processing time for noise reduction, higher frame rates and generally snappier performance. Since I spend time out in the dark, I was concerned with low light performance. This gets into a discussion of how the new sensor performs. The new sensor has about double the dynamic range as the MkII.  At night, I expose at ISO100 for 10 minutes typically and sharpness was always excellent on the MkII, I never complained. Yet the MkIII is better in several ways; the pixels are \"sharper\" the fringing/noise is far lower and the color appears more accurate. There are also non-specific differences in that images seem to \"look better\" which is totally subjective, when shot with the MkIII.I know the new 6D will be readily available soon and it will be a great camera from what I have read. And with the 6d came two improvements I wish were included in the 5dMkIII; the built-in GPS and WiFi. I did buy the external GPS receiver and I am generally happy with it. I wish it were smaller and more \"informative\" on its own. But now I can tag my image files with GPS data. And it works in Lightroom 4.Besides these two obvious exclusions, I have found wanting for almost nothing else with the MKIII. Yet, I do have my wish list. And this goes for all SLR's and even all digital cameras.My Wish List:- Include a built in intervalometer with bulb ramping (google it) and lightning triggers, along with full time-lapse as well as internal stacking. This would make a lot of sense.Better yet, the entire line of Canon cameras should have APPS. This way, the entire photographic community can create time-lapse, tracking, remote control and a host of other amazing functions all run from a menu. Wouldn't that be incredible? You could buy or create any software function you could imagine.- Like I said, include the GPS and WiFi remote control AND bluetooth functionality.- Add USB 3.0 transfer directly so I can stop using a card reader.- Lower the price by $500 and Canon, you will own the DSLR market.Thats what I have so far, I know I have left out a lot of the new functionality because it's not as meaningful to me.

Both of my 5Dmk2 shutter lives were over the 150,000 \"clicks\" from Canon so I used that to justify my upgrade.  I sent in the 5d2 for service as I am going to keep one of them for backup and to second shoot.I have reviewed things before like the Canon 70-200mm f2.8 v2 lens HERE.  Once again this review doesn't contain any charts and scientific mathematical optical graphs comparing the  5dmk2 to the 5dmk3.  But I do have real world (for me) tests.Ive had 5 sessions with the new 5DMK3...here is MY mini review with 5 images (edited in LR and CS6)1) Focus is light years better than mk2. Canon finally got it right. My 50mm 1.2 that I never use because of poor performance with my mk2 (even after sending it in to Canon to have them calibrate it together) is now spot on. You can pick your focus point with your zoom or primes at IT NAILS IT. Using the dials I can pick the tiny red square where I want it to focus on my portraits and guess what?  It nails it!  No more trying to lock focus at 2.8 or wider then recomposing, zooming in, trying it again, over and over.  Although it is a hard habit to break from 4 years with the 5dmk2s.  But I finally feel confident when the shutter clicks (which is probably how most Nikon users already feel).2) The camera seems \"faster\".The shutter makes a more \"confident\" sound without being louder... and is quicker. Sounds like a \"quiet\" machine gun that the other cameras (like Nikon) must sound like when shooting multishot.3)The screen is gorgeous, bright, and HUGE. The magnification with one press takes you right into a zoom.  No more plus, plus,plus,plus,plus to look at eyes then minus,minus,minus,minus,minus to back out.  It looks amazing and clear...even outdoors in bright sun at the beach. Its like going from a 13inch laptop screen to a 30inch monitor. The only thing that it a hard habit to break is Canon moved the magnifying glass to the other side of the camera so I keep pressing the wrong button with my thumb to magnify.  It is now on the left which will take some time getting used to.4)The 70-200 firing INTO direct sun at sunset was a little slow to focus and had a little difficulty. The primes 85 and 50 did not.  The 85 is my go to lens for my portrait work so I don't see that being to much of an issue for me.  Also the 24mm 1.2 L performed amazing with the 5d3 as it had some of the same problems on the 5d2 as the 50mm 1.2 did.5) The \"cloudy\" WB setting in RAW (which is what I usually shoot under for nice skin tones) comes out a little too \"orange\" with the 5d3. I went back to AWB. I can adjust in LR if needed or I may just set it myself in camera slightly cooler than 5500K.  But it is noticeable to me.I am trilled with the camera at this point.  The focus issue is worth the upgrade to me.  The images are gorgeous...just like the 5d2.  I really didn't expect to see a HUGE difference in the quality of the final image.  For me and my workflow it is the ease of use and speed that I GET those images that is a huge plus for me.*I think you have two choices: Trade to the Nikon system OR get the 5d3 to stay with Canon. I have shot with Nikon before. It feels like that when shooting with the 5d3-fast, confident, spot on focus.

The Mark II had really served me well, but I didn't have rain protection on one of my photo tours this year and during the week of intense rains here in Colorado, the Mark II gave out after being in the rain for 2 days. I needed a camera right away while my Mark II went in for repairs.I decided to go with the Mark III since it used compact flash and also I wanted the upgraded 61-point focusing system and the faster frame rate.  Both the Mark III and the 6D have the new Digic 5+ processor which is amazing but the Mark III can shoot at a full 6fps allowing me to use the camera in more action related situations and so I didn't need to purchase a 2nd camera for the occasional sporting events I was shooting.On my last photo tour we did some astro photography just outside of Crested Butte Colorado on Ohio Pass and the result was some amazing images at ISO 5000 with little to no noise! I literally was able to use image right out of the camera with no post noise reduction.I also shoot portraits and occasionally I get requests to shoot the kids in action. I went to one of the high school football games to capture of few of my students in action on the football field and I was able to shoot at ISO 12800 so I could capture the players in action with a fast enough shutter speed. This in combination with 6fps gave me clean crisp images. Post noise reduction was minimal.  The 5D Mark II would never have been able to match this camera's performance.  Iso 6400 on the Mark II is loaded with noise so 12800.I am disappointed in the fact that the SD card slot is not UDMA-7 compatible and will only support write speeds of 133X.  If you want to shoot fast with no buffering then don't use the SD card slot.  Stick to the compact flash. When you pair this camera with the Lexar 1000X  or San Disk Extreme Pro CF cards it can shoot all day long at 6fps and you never notice any buffering.I love the new beefier body and grip.  It feels really good in the hands and ever better than the Mark II.  Though it is heavier, I love the magnesium body. This camera is much more solid and tight sealing than my Mark II, though during my trip to Telluride I made sure I had rain and snow protection for the camera.The price is high for this camera, but I'm totally happy with my purchase. I'm glad I didn't settle for the 6D. The new 61-point focusing system and the 6fps frame rate made this the right purchase for me, plus the fact that I could take advantage of my already huge investment in compact flash cards I already owned and didn't have to move to new SD cards.Love this investment in my business!

The guy who shoots for the likes of Quiznos and Honda let ripped the massive shutter from the first compact body full-frame camera from Canon. That was late 2005.

It has been two generations of 5d-series since that faithful morning.Today we have the 5D Mark III. I'm not gonna go into all the feature doodads on this review. 276 reviewers before me has done enough. I will share my thoughts as a user.As a portrait/wedding shooter, this camera is nigh on perfect. It is FAST. It made my already fast 7d felt slow and sluggish. I love how I can run around the 61-AF points. I am no longer limited to using the center-point for reliable AF-ing (5d/2). It opens up my compositional creativity.The silent shutter allowed me to get in and close to the ceremony without being an annoyance.High ISO capability is astounding.22mp is perfect file size for me as I go through hundreds to thousands of images at one go.Sure there are other FF cameras are good at this or that. Sure. I give you that.What really make the 5d3 stand above the likes of D800, 6d, d600 or even 1ds3 is its wonderful ergonomics. I've used all of its rival cameras and the 5d3 fits like a glove. It doesn't make you think through or do finger acrobatics to change settings. Canon put a lot of thought in revising the functional button placements. Like the 7d, a focus group was referenced on button placements. The result is a tool that allowed me to get the job done - take pretty photos.It is not without its faults. Most glaringly, the slow SD card read. The burst depth goes down when the SD card is used as dual write.Contrast to the price of the old 5D Mk I, the 5d3 is ridiculously well priced for what it can deliver.

It has a professional feel to it, which I know is a cosmetic feature, but I personally love the feeling. The buttons are laid out rather nicely and easy to access while shooting. My one complaint is the zoom button. I don't know where Canon was going with this but it's awkward. It will take some getting used to, but honestly if a zoom button is your deal breaker, you shouldn't be looking at this camera any way. The LCD screen is large, which is very nice, the color on screen is amazingly vibrant and true to what shows up on the computer.The Focal PointsI never knew what I was missing with only 9 focal points, but after playing around with the 61 different points on the 5D, I am impressed. During sessions I tend to shoot AF, out of convenience, in shooting AF though you rely on the camera to know where you want to focus and often times I found (at least with my 50D) that this led to soft images or soft faces. With the 5D I am able to completely manipulate AF with the push of a button. I set the focal point to the face and get my exact shot. This also comes in handy with macro shots. I find that getting a crisp macro is very hard on AF, as the focus is often soft or off. With spot focusing I can achieve the shot I want much faster without having to struggle with the camera not being able to lock on. The AF on this camera is a huge improvement and produces sharp, quality images.ISOThe ISO was something I was most excited to try out. I am amazed with the results at 1600, after minor RAW adjustments to the noise, there is virtually no grain and the image is perfectly useable. I did test the 25600 and while I would never use this ISO in a shoot situation, I was impressed with the quality. Yes there was noise, but you're at an ISO of 25600, what do you expect? This camera produces quality images at larger ISOs. As a portrait photographer, this can be an advantage. I don't like to set my shutter bellow 1/125 and in some situations having the ability to bump my ISO up to 800 with no hint of grain/noise after post processing really makes a difference.Image QualityI am highly impressed with the image quality of this camera. Images come out very true to life and are crisp. My first impression: Blown away with the quality. The detail, even when zooming in is crisp and to the point. The color, as I have said, is true to life. The reds are not as manipulated as in some of Canons other cameras. The camera is able to capture light perfectly as well, creating amazing hair-lights without external flash. In my opinion the image quality is top notch (right where it should be for such a high power DSLR)The duel axis electronic level is also a pretty neat feature. The level is great for landscapes and beach shooting. Yes you can produce a quick fix post image, but it is nice option to have.HDR featureI didn't really have an opinion about the addition of in camera HDR. It is really not a feature I thought I would ever have a need for. I have never been a huge fan of HDR, but the in camera HDR feature is actually quite fun to play with.Lastly, I just want to mention that the auto feature is amazing. 9/10 I get a perfect picture with auto, makes my job amazingly easy. I get to show up, put the camera on auto and snap away. {:) Okay, kidding there, wanted to liven up the post.}I have to say that I am amazed at this camera. Yes I did step up from a 50D, but my expectations were blow away with the quality of images this camera can capture. The colors and detail are true to life, which is a big deal to me. For the first time I feel like I can reach my full potential with this camera, yes I got amazing pictures with my 50D and `L' lenses, but I was never quite getting exactly what I saw, with the 5D MK III I am.  If you're upgrading from a semi-pro body you will be happy, ecstatic even. Overall in my opinion Canon produced a high quality product, but wants a tad too much money for it.My advice for this camera is to get it if you are ready for the upgrade. By ready for the upgrade I mean have an arsenal of L lenses. Yes, USM will work with this camera, but to get the most out of it, L is the way to go. This is a camera for professionals, that being said If you have a semi-pro body and a variety of L lenses, and looking to step up a bit, then maybe this is the camera for you. If you don't have any L lenses, then invest in those first.Stepping up from a 50D this is a 5 star camera.Stepping up from a 5D MKII (which I have used a handful of times) it is probably a 4 star camera.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Videographer review", "Author": "Chris Ace \"Chris Ace\"", "ReviewID": "R2RYMCKICPALW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Note: I use DSLR mostly for video, not photo.

AFTER 3 TRIPS TO THE REPAIR CENTER, CANON FINALLY REPAIRED MY CAMERA.I got this camera as a birthday gift this year. It worked great for the first 2 month and I noticed a lot of dust just started sticking to the sensor and isn't falling off. I never had this issue with my Canon EOS 7D which I had for 2 years now. On my Canon EOS 7D, I rarely get dust, and when I do, it usually gets shaken off by the self cleaning unit on the next power cycle. On my Canon EOS 5D Mark III, this never happened. The dust just kept collecting and collecting (the sensor was a dust magnet), so I sensed something was wrong with the self cleaning unit. Not to mention the camera was underexposing 80% of the time. I sent it into the Canon Irvine, CA service center for them to repair it. They adjusted the camera meter. They also adjusted the self cleaning sensor unit (so it was malfunctioning) and did a sensor clean. When I got it back, I noticed they left a bunch of residue and dust on my sensor (more than what I had before). The self sensor cleaning unit did nothing to it. Canon support gave me a shipping label back to get it fixed. So I sent it back in. A week later I got it back, not only was my sensor dirtier (I have test shots), they also left several scratches across the back of my camera and on the side! I contacted Canon support again. They gave me a label to ship it back in to get all the problems fixed. Now they want me to pay almost $280 for replacement parts even though all these issues happened because of the camera malfunction and due to the repair center worker's carelessness! To add insult to injury, I shared this repair story on their Facebook page. Instead of replying me to make things right, they just deleted my post all together. Very scammy company, do not recommend buying their products. I will attempt to work things out with their customer support. Will keep you guys posted. Also Canon, if you are reading this, having to send in my camera in for repair for the same issues (and issues introduced during the repairs) 3 times is very unacceptable.To people who says the reviews are about the products and not the repair centers. It is about the product. Not only is my camera screwed up on the basic functions of a digital camera, don't count on Canon to honor their in-warranty repairs (which is part of the product you buy). If you get a defective Canon EOS 5D Mark III, guess what? You are out $3500+tax!Update 7-11-2013:After 3 trips to Canon's repair center (still pretty ridiculous how they didn't get it right the first time), they have adequately fixed my camera. While there are still a few dust spots on the sensor, they are barely noticeable, so they did clean my camera to an acceptable level. It seems CPS handled my repair this time as my camera came back in a CPS bag. Also they have decided to replace the scratched up parts (caused by the repair center) for free after I complained to their Facebook page. Since my camera is usable now, I will need to take this camera and shoot before I can give a full review on the product. Right now I have upped my review to 3 stars and I doubt I will ever give it a 5 star rating due to the fact that the I had to send the camera in 3 times to get an in-warranty repair correct. If the warranty is part of the product you buy, Canon needs to be able to honor that warranty before the customer needs to make complaints online.MAIN REVIEW HERE (10-15-2013):I will not raise my star rating from 3/5 on this camera due to the problems I am about to describe in this review and the horrible warranty service I received. This is an okay camera, and can work very fast in continuous shutter mode. The focus tracking is very fast and I have used it on quick moving subjects and it hits the mark 95% of the time. Also, I can use this camera up to ISO 6400 with no issue in low light. While a bit grainy, there is barely any image noise even at ISO 6400. There is also no noise even during long exposures. I only spotted around 5 tiny \"hot pixels\" after a 4 minute long exposure. The camera has a built in \"quiet mode\" which kind of works. It suppresses the mirror slap noise, and I have used a few times outside around wildlife. While it does make a sound, ambient noise is enough to cover over it! Sometimes, I accidentally fire off 2 shots in this mode because I didn't hear the mirror. Also, this camera is incredibly rugged, and I have shot with it in rain and under waterfalls. No water got in and it performs very well (just make sure you have a weatherproofed lens too!). The only few issues that still persists in this camera is underexposure and white balance. My camera still constantly underexposes 2/3 to 1 stop around 75% of the time even though the light meter has already been checked and adjusted several times at the repair center during that self sensor cleaning problem. Also, I have noticed that the auto white balance is always off especially in day light. All my photos always have a blue cast on them and I always have to white balance off of something I know is white when I process my RAW files.Pros:- Rugged construction. Good weatherproofing.- Quiet mode does make some noise, however ambient noise is enough to cover it.- Great low light high ISO performance. Works great up to ISO 6400.- Low noise during long exposures.- Very fast at focusing and focus tracking.Cons:- Constant under exposure by 2/3 to 1 stop 75% of the time even though repair center has checked meter several times.- Inaccurate auto white balance.- Horrible warranty repairs and service.Overall, I am not too happy with the camera and would not recommend this product, and believe that Canon has to work out the big bugs in the system and also need to get some better repair technicians in their factory.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Canon Prosumer SLR So Far", "Author": "Larry Chen", "ReviewID": "R2BGBW9YVN1RRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best Canon Prosumer SLF so far, and frankly speaking probably the best among all the brands.

For me personally, I love the superior AF, Quiet Shutter, 100% accurate view finder and much improved high ISO noise. These were the lacking features in the original 5D that bugged me each time I used it. And so after 6 years of ownership, I pulled the trigger on the new 5D3 once I saw a big enough price drop.As much as I enjoy shooting with this camera, there are a few things that can still be improved upon. First, the RAW dynamic range of this camera, although good and improved, is still slightly behind compared to Nikon and Sony's offerings. This would affect those who shoot landscapes under contrasty conditions. The Auto-ISO feature is less sophisticated than that found on Nikons which seems to choose higher shutter speeds and ISO to permit less camera shake. And finally, I wished the 5D3 could AF down to -3EV like the newer 6D. I know this is wishful thinking though. And finally, the pricing is a bit too high at full MSRP. Canon is a bit greedy for charging what they wanted.Overall, this is an amazing DSLR. I do NOT regret getting the 5D3 one bit.

There isn't a wide angle Nikon Tilt/Shift available for architecture photography.Great Auto White-Balance results most of the time.Beautiful LCD Screen.Quick Dial - 10 times easier to use than Nikon's navigation pad.Intuitive video controlsIntelligent and fast autofocusGreat high iso noise performance.Silent shutter mode, very quiet.IR Remote can trigger Bulb mode with one click, and stop B-mode with another click, instead of having to hold the button for that.Pros compared to 5D Mark II:Better high iso noise performanceBigger buttonsThe quick dial is touch sensitive during video recording, you don't have to rotate the dial, all you need to do is just lightly tap up/down/left/right and settings change during video recording.  This reduces camera generated noise.Dedicated video recording/LV buttonWider range in auto-isoFaster continuous shootingSlightly better ergonomicsBetter AF system/AF speedBetter (only slightly) exposure metering.Cons of 5D Mark III (compared to Nikon D700):\"Spot\" metering is only for center focusing point, you can not assign spot metering to any other focusing point.  Which makes composing a photo in difficult lighting situations more time consuming.Highlight gets easily blown out if highlight tone priority is turned off.  If you turn highlight tone priority on, shadow detail gets very noisy.Horrible metering system, it's extremely hard to get a perfect exposure during tricky lighting conditions.  Where Nikon's sophisticated 3D matrix color metering would always get you exactly what you want.  (For example, people in shadows, people/objects against very bright/dark background, in the snow)  In this case, manual exposure is the only way to go, except it's much slower to adjust for settings.There is no way to turn quick dial to go back to previous photos during image preview, immediately following taking a photo.  One extra button needs to be pressed to view previously taken photos, where on Nikon I can just press left and right to immediately view previous photos taken.Opening CF/SD card door turns camera off.JPG performance is horribleIn camera HDR is pretty much useless and generates sub-par results, better do it in software than in-camera.No interval-timer build in.I honestly think that the 5D Mark II is a much better value, if you don't need the faster continuous shooting rate or video functions.I hope my review can help you in deciding for the correct camera to own.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Expensive, but in a class of its own.", "Author": "DC Jones 81", "ReviewID": "R3PRDPXIJYUAGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You get two things from Canon EOS 5D Mark III 22.3 MP Full Frame CMOS with 1080p Full-HD Video Mode Digital SLR Camera (Body) that are game changers.

I own a 7D, whichs is my baby in the crop sensored camera world. After many years of shooting with my 7D, I wanted to upgrade to full frame. I was never interested in the 5D series, because I was more than happy with my 7D. Then along came the 5D Mark III.the 5D Mark III is the perfect upgrade for any 7D owner looking to invest in a truly full frame (24mm x 36mm) camera. The superbly constructed body and button layout are well designed for hours of shooting comfort and camera exposure operations. It's very similar to the 7D and so original 5D owners will need to get use to the change.The 61 point High Density Reticular AF with 41 cross type and 5 dual digital focal points are INSANELY FAST and ACCURATE. It doesn't matter what you focus on with this camera, you will get the shot, keep your eye on the subject and your finger on the trigger and you got it. By far the best AF system I've ever experienced.The LP6 battery life is exceellent. You can easily shoot 700 photos and have plenty of power remaining.I love the metering in this camera. If you want to save time by not having to process photos, this camera will surely cut your post processing time in half. The color rendering with the 63 zone IFCL will accurately give you the neutral (what you see) exposure.Night shooting with the Mark III is phenomenal. This camera has the night vision of a barn owl and will grab the shot you least expect to grab in EXTREMELY low light. I often shoot between 3000-5000 ISO with very good results.A pop-up flash would have been a great addtion for this camera. However, not having one isn't a show stopper by any means. I'm sure canon had their reason for leaving off the pop-up flash - Maybe to keep it more 5D like. Othewise, just call it the 7D-2.with dual memory cards, you won't run out of storage space. The LCD display is remarkably clear and precise, even in direct sunlight. In my opinion, it's far better than any other camera in it's class.

This is truly a professional level tool and although I was / am very impressed with the T2i this camera is on a whole different level. From the moment I took it out of the box I could feel the quality with the magnesium frame and solid controls. There are a number of excellent reviews already posted on this camera so I thought I would write one from the perspective of someone coming from a more entry-level / Rebel level camera to the 5Dm3 in terms of what to expect when you \"take the plunge\" - quite a plunge indeed, considering the cost.Here are the top advantages (IMHO) compared to the T2i:- Higher ISO. Way higher. I can't wait to take this to an upcoming campout with my daughter. I'll finally be able to take existing light pictures at the campfire!- Full Frame. I used to shoot film years ago and this is (of course) my first non-crop camera. It is wonderful that 24 mm MEANS 24 mm again! I was not expecting this to be such a big factor for me.- The viewfinder is wonderful! Pentaprism is the way to go. It feels like I was looking through a porthole before and now it is a window.- Focus. There are almost too many options to choose here. Whatever you are shooting, from moving 1 year olds like another reviewer to 9 year old soccer players like I have to professional sports or weddings focus is spot on. (though I have to admit not personally shooting professional sports or weddings - though this camera makes me feel like I could.)- Dual Card Slots. Allows many possibilities including use of EyeFi while still having plenty of capacity in a CF card.- Huge amount of control down to the ability to micro-adjust / \"fit\" each of your lenses to the camera for tack sharp focus.- Nice to have the scene modes out of the way (not present) on the mode selector dial. But also nice to have a full auto \"just in case\" for that emergency grab of the camera to take an ASAP shot with no time to think.Cons:- Cost. Of course.- It is heavier than the T2i but it \"wears it well\" - feels balanced in the hand / fits like a glove.- No flash. I know, I know if you want good flash results you don't count on a pop-up - but it would be nice to have in a pinch; though high ISO does make up for this somewhat.- No autofocus in Video. I wonder if they will somehow implement this via firmware update now that it is available on the T4i? Well, I bought this for stills anyway.Not Better or Worse just Different:- Menu layout is familiar but with the joystick and 2 wheels can be confusing at first; but already I am getting used to the logic.- Mode selector dial on left not right.- LCD display on top of camera. I suspect soon I'll move this to the advantages.Overall I am very impressed with this camera and would highly recommend it to other advanced amateurs considering the move from something like the T2i. The cost is certainly a factor, of course, I would not have taken the plunge without a recent bit of good luck in the market.

While the Canon 5D Mark II was a game-changing camera, its 9-point autofocus system was extremely lacking. The 5D Mark III solved that problem, completely revamping the autofocus system and giving it virtually the same system as its big brother, the Canon 1DX.The following review is based on my personal experiences as a photography instructor. I currently own and use the Canon 1DX, the 5D Mark III, and the 7D and have owned the older 5D Mark II, 1DS Mark III, and the 1D Mark IV so I will try to describe how I feel this camera compares to these other possible contenders.First of all, this is a game changing camera for not just wedding, landscape, and studio photography, but also for WILDLIFE AND BIRDING! I honestly didn't think it could compare to the 1D Mark IV when it came to wildlife and birding but after extensive testing, it kills the 1D Mark IV (and yes, I own both cameras so I'm not knocking the 1D4, just saying, the technology here, several years after the 1D4 came out is superior and it shows.)HIGH ISO NOISE IMPROVEMENTS:The best improvement over the 1D Mark IV in this regard is the high ISO noise reduction and the improved autofocus. Noise is non-existent even at ISO 1600 which is about the highest ISO I shoot at for wildlife. Sure, you can remove noise in post but that comes at a cost in IQ so this camera saves some shots that were previously quite difficult to achieve.AUTOFOCUS:Autofocus is phenomenal... absolutely phenomenal. There are about 5 tabs in the menu system just for the autofocus system, giving you precision controls you normally didn't have access to. Besides the high-ISO noise improvements, the autofocus is the other improvement that completely destroys the 1D Mark IV.COLOR ACCURACY AND IMAGE SIZE:The color accuracy and vibrancy out of the box is great, even shooting with a \"neutral\" or \"faithful\" color setting. RAW files are about 24 MB in size, 45 MB if you convert to DNG and embed the original as I do.OTHER:The ergonomics are better, more on par with the 7D. The buttons are more responsive, the LCD is clearer and more accurate. The menu system is completely different, although if you've used the 7D, you will notice the similar layout.5D3 or 1DX:I was torn between this camera and the new 1DX whenever it comes out. I still plan on replacing the 5D3 with the 1DX after it's been out for a few months just to get the upgraded weather sealing, increased shutter durability, and pro-grade construction but I'm telling you, this camera is going to cost Canon a lot of sales of the 1DX because this camera can do almost everything the 1DX can, at a higher megapixel count and more compact size, at HALF THE PRICE!\"LIGHTLEAK ISSUE\"People who are obsessed with finding anything wrong with these cameras have found that in the first batches, there was an issue where if you shooting in complete darkness and were using the cameras metering (impossible), AND you happened to have the top LCD panel light on, the camera may display a slightly inaccurate metering reading. This is absurd that people are even obsessing over this. First of all, these people don't know how to use a camera and should spend some time learning photography before buying one of this caliber. This is obvious because any experienced photograher knows, you can't use metering in complete darkness anyway because these are long exposure shots that require trial and error to get right. The issue has been fixed by Canon and users of the original batch of cameras can send theirs in to Canon to be fixed for free. Again, this is seriously a non-issue so don't let it scare you off from buying this camera.*** I DO NOT work for Canon or any other camera manufacturer. This review is my own personal opinion.

Please notice this is the T3 without the i . . .A great street camera which really gets you used to the technology and the set-up.Then progress to the wonderful, built-like-a-tank Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Body Only) which really carries you to the next level, into the pro's in fact. A camera built for hard use with the features you need.Then come into the light with this top of the line camera, the desire of all shutterbugs, pro and aficionado.The first thing you notice straight out of the box is the smaller size and yet solid build. Tiny features you really really appreciate right away is the fact the function changing button LOCKS, so when you set it to MANUAL (as you will all of the time), it doesn't migrate on its own to Bulb or Av OR WORSE, jsut when you were thinking you were cool with Manual and had to take an instant shot on the street.You also notice the repositioning of the buttons, such as the Quick Menu display which gives you access to the various settings as on the 7D. It is now on the right side in a space very convenient for righties. In fact, the redesign seems to favor the righties world.I need to study the manual further to find out what this RATE button is all about.Of course this review only begins not even to scratch the surface of all that is here, but this is right out of the box and clearly the epitome, the apex, of the DSLR camera today. I haven't even begun to mention how incredible this camera can be with the High Dynamic Range feature, the ISO range from FIFTY (for photography on the surface of the sun?) all the way to infinity and BEYOND (actually maybe 256000 or sometihng like that) for taking shots in total darkness as I tend to do on city streets and alleys at night.Study carefully the manual and do not lose it.

It took me some time and learning and this was a great beginner camera.  Eventually I had good quality glass and some know how and the 7D grabbed my attention.  I bought my 7D in 2010 and haven't had a camera more than 1 year since.  Then the 5D Mark III was introduced.  I have been longing for it ever since.  I was able to pick one up about 2 months ago and I positively love it.  There are plenty of reviews here and elsewhere that cover the camera in detail, so I will focus on comparing it to my last 2 cameras; the 7D and the 5D Mark II.AF:I bought this camera for the AF system.  If the 5D2 had a focus system similar to the 7D, I probably would have stuck with it. If the 7D had been full frame, I would have stuck with it.  I loved the way the 7D AF system worked, so I was thrilled to see they brought the 5D series up in this regard.  The focus system lives up to my expectations.High ISO Noise:I thought I bought the camera for the AF system.  Then I started taking pictures at higher ISO speeds.  WOW!  I am positively blown away.  The 7D took what I would consider clean shots at ISO 3200 and decent at 6400.  The 5D2 was great at 3200 and reasonably clean at 6400.  The 5D3 is cleaner at 12,800 than the 5D2 was at 6400!  Time and time again I'm blown away.  I already have more shots at 12,800 with the 5D3 than I have at 6400 from either of my past cameras.Ergonomics:Lastly, the 5D3 gets the layout of the 7D with some additional improvements.  The video/live view mode setup is much better than it is on the 5D2.  The M-Fn button is great to have for flipping through AF point modes.  The DoF button set up for toggling drive modes is great.  But most of all, in conjunction with the ISO performance, I can now set the camera to Av mode, leave it on Auto ISO and pretty much forget the rest of my settings.  I set a minimum shutter speed and fire at will.  The results are outstanding and this camera is an absolute joy to use!Conclusion:If you have the cash, I would not hesitate to grab this camera if you are really into photography.  I am just a hobbyist, but I cherish the pictures I take of my kids.  Now being able to shoot in low light at ISO 12,800 with good shutter speeds I am getting far more \"keepers\" and I honestly don't long for anything more from a camera body.

You know you want to, or you would not be reading these reviews. Like many 7D owners, I've wanted to step up to full frame for years. I agonized over the price of the 5DIII. Is it worth it? Is it THAT much more satisfying to use than a 6D? I asked myself and read every review that I could. After biting the bullet and buying the 5DIII, I got my answer within the first hours of shooting: HELLZ YEAH!This camera isn't for everybody. If you're stepping up from a Rebel, you'll be just as happy or happier with a 6D. If you use a camera occasionally for family photos and vacation pics, this camera is probably expensive overkill. But if you're a serious enthusiast-- particularly one who has pushed a 7D to its limits, you're going to love the 5DIII. (If you're a pro, it's a business decision and you probably aren't looking to Amazon reviews for guidance).The image quality and handling are nothing short of amazing. With the ability to add lens profiles, this camera makes even your cheapest glass look stellar. My 50 mm 1.4 USM looks better with this camera than the $1,200 50 mm 1.2 L does on a 5DII. And if you own any L glass, there aren't enough superlatives for how fantastic they look when shot with the 5DIII.If you can part with the money, buy with confidence.

The 7D is a fantastic camera, it was far ahead of its time in 2009 in terms of auto focus and continuous shooting speed.  It is also a very nicely built piece of equipment, solid and weather sealed, but without that \"heavy as a cinder block\" feel of many \"professional\" camera bodies.  The 5D MK III shares all of those characteristics: solidly built, but not huge and bulky.  It features an even better AF system, and while not quite as fast in terms of continuous shooting (6fps vs. 8fps), it's certainly no slouch.Now, where the 5D MK III shines is in low light image quality.  I rarely pushed the 7D beyond ISO 1600 because images shot at ISO levels beyond that exhibited significant noise.  Yes, it could be eliminated with post processing, but only if one was willing to sacrifice a ton of image detail.  Conversely, the full frame sensor of the 5D MK III yields perfectly useable .jpg images straight from camera at ISO 3200, 6400 and even 12,800.  Of course, most folks who purchase this camera will elect to shoot RAW and then post process.  The RAW images contain a tremendous amount of detail and are extremely \"crop-able\".  I recently shot a series of raptor photos with this camera and a Sigma 50-500 OS lens.  The feather detail and sharpness was phenomenal!  The in-camera HDR feature on this camera is also very usable.  It creates very natural looking images that are well balanced between light and dark areas.While I will likely keep the 7D as a \"backup\" DSLR body, I am very happy with my purchase, and consider it a worthwhile upgrade.  I'd definitely recommend this camera to my friends.Of course, the best \"testimonial\" I can give to the quality of a camera is actual photographs.

Main reason was indoor photography without a flash, where this camera really shines. I believe I'm getting a 4 stop improvement over the 7d, which really does make a difference indoors if you want to avoid using a flash. For outdoor photography with good light, I'm not certain that the 5d Mark III has a huge advantage over the 7d, though many would say the 5D is sharper. I haven't done a head to head comparison outdoors however.Also almost all of the buttons are exactly where they were on the 7D, making the transition very easy. SD card slot is a bonus since I have a bunch of high capacity SD cards lying around, and I haven't noticed the speed disadvantage over CF that people seem to talk about, at least for what I'm doing which is mainly stills and occasional video.I would highly recommend this camera as an upgrade to the 7D (or any other crop sensor camera) if you are looking to take high quality photos indoors without a flash.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME Camera!!", "Author": "TLN", "ReviewID": "R2ASJUECIS5ZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would write a bunch of great things and the non bad :) about the camera but it's already been said so many times by most of the users here.

So you're not bored with another long reviews.1,  I'm not afraid to shoot in (the dark!)low lit area. I can now crank up the ISO and not worry how noisy the shots will turn out! The camera processes the noise reduction is awesome! And 2, I love the silent mode. I was shooting at a wedding ceremony with other photographers during the vow exchange and my 5DIII is the only one that didn't make the loud snapping clicking camera sounds, theirs did and it distracted the groom a bit (maybe he was looking for an escape route)  ...  but anyhoot, mine was silent!

The 5D is a little bit bigger than the 7D but both have similar build qualities. Some of the things that have changed from the 7D to the 5Dmkiii is the shooting function button, to change from Manual to Shutter Priority there is now a button on top that stops you from accidentally changing modes. Other than that, the ergonomics are pretty much the same (outside of the AF System).I had been shooting with the 7D for some time and I was really on the fence about making the move because I swear (and still do given I own both cameras) that there is not a significant difference between the images of the cameras when shooting at lower ISO's. When looking at both images side by side colors are slightly better, it seems like tonal gradients looked a little better but it was not huge. The problem I had with the 7D is that at ISO 3200 the images were so noisy they were about unusable, even with some cleanup things were pretty rough. I have shot many images with the 5D3 and I get great looking shots at ISO3200.The other huge difference is the AF System on the 5D3, head and shoulders better than anything I had ever used. The 7D was good and worked well and I had an old 1DMkii that had 45AF Points and was blazing fast but the new 5D was amazing and how many different configurations of the AF system you could set took me months to get used to but I love it. Sure the Nikon D800 has 36megapixels but I have always said, I will take a lower resolution shot that is spot on and crisp over a high resolution image that is blurry.Both in studio and out in nature this camera performs well and is very refined. I have shot with the Canon 7D, Sony NEX 5, NEX 3 and the new Fuji X-E2 and will take this camera every time. It has an AF System I can count on to be spot on every time, the ergonomics of it allow me to pull the camera out of my bag and change shutter, aperture and ISO without ever moving my eye out of the viewfinder and the LCD screen looks great in back.If I were going to knock anything it might be the slower burst mode but that would be about it. I don't shoot enough video with it to really talk about it's performance but I know a lot of people love it for that.************UPDATE****************** 04-09-2014After my last studio shoot I decided to send my camera into canon for cleaning (I normally have my camera sent out in January when I am shooting less to make sure everything is working right) and I get the estimate back that the there is dust between the low pass filter and the sensor and because of that the sensor needs to be replaced. Keep in mind at this point the camera had been used mainly in studio and never seen a drop of rain and is never kept without a lens or body cap on the camera AND the camera is only 15 months old. Given the light use and delicate care I take with my equipment and that I had a 7D for over two years working in the exact same environments with no problems, I feel this is 100% a manufacturers defect. After writing Canon several times they refused to address the problem and I was stuck with a 940 dollar bill.After the new sensor had been placed in the camera everything works good.To me it is crazy to think that needing to replace the sensor every year is a normal thing and considering Canon refuses to answer my questions regarding this repair I am to assume this is somewhat common.At this point I am never buying another Canon product ever again. There are too many great camera manufacturers out there to hold allegiance to a company that does not value me as a customer. I have owned the 20D, 7D and 5Dmkii. I own the 16-35 L, 24-70L, 35mm L, 50mm macro, 85 1.8, 100mm Macro L, 135 L and 70-200 L.

The price can be a little intimidating on a camera like this, but after using one for nine months now I am completely blown away by it. It has exceeded my expectations in every way. On my XTi and 50D I got to the point on both of them where I felt my skill exceeded the limits of the camera. With the 5D3 however, it has definitely given me that creative refresh where I am able to explore the limits of what can indeed be done with a modern DSLR. The build quality is rock solid, the grip is very comfortable in my large hands. The 100% viewfinder is beautiful, along with the rear LCD which makes reviewing photos a pleasure. The AF is very sophisticated and will require some getting used to if you're coming from a camera with a lesser system like the 50D. But once you learn your way around it, you'll realize it can keep up with anything. When I transfer files from my memory card to the computer, I am consistently floored by the absolutely amazing amount of detail the sensor is capable of picking up. Paired with my retina macbook pro, I actually sit with my jaw wide open while reviewing the details at 100%.

I was at the point where the Rebel was limiting me mainly in terms of high ISO image quality and the AF. I was unsure whether to try out another APS-C camera (the T4i or 7D potentially or a maybe even a mirrorless alternative) or make the \"leap\" to a Full Frame (FF) camera. As you can tell I decided to make the leap to a FF camera. I ended up selling my 17-55 zoom, 85 1.8 and 40 mm pancake and bought this 5D along with a used 135L that has been my only lens until today. Here is what I will tell you about this camera:1) You will not be disappointed in it unless maybe you are coming from a 1DX for some reason. The only thing about this camera that I wish was better is its burst rate, period. There is nothing else that disappoints me about it. - Battery life? Amazing. - High ISO? I have no issue keeping pictures taken at 12800 ISO. - AF? Blazing fast and all those AF points are glorious.2) It will likely make you spend a lot more than its $3k entrance price on lenses and other camera accessories. If you get the zoom lens with the kit you may eventually get the urge to upgrade to a faster zoom or a prime and even if you don't get the kit lens and use it with some of the better non-L lenses (85 f1.8, 100 f2) you will likely still catch the L bug and move up to some L primes (135L, 35L, 50L etc etc) due to their amazing image quality, build quality etc. Honestly, if you're buying this camera you will want to pair it with the best your money can get you because it will just continue to give back the more you give to it.3) It is, in my mind, worth every penny of its entrance price. I've gotten way more out of this camera than I dreamed of getting from my old setup. Keep in mind that I had a T3i with 17-55mm f/2.8 (great lens), 85mm f/1.8 (great lens) and 50mm f/1.8 and I am telling you that I've gotten more out of my 5D with just a 135mm f/2 (amazing lens) attached to it. I've just recently purchased a 35L to add to my collection.4) Take your time to learn all of the settings and really get used to the camera. I take a lot of pictures of my dog so getting to know the different AI Servo settings and learning about the focus points has been very helpful.5) If you're worried about weight then this guy is quite heavy. But what I will tell you is that weight is the #1 reason that I used to have the Rebel series because I thought this was way larger and heavier but in reality I've come to learn that the extra bulk is actually something I like. I'm never in a position where I think \"Oh man my Rebel would have been so much easier to carry right now\" but I'm always in a position where I'm thinking \"Gosh I could not have taken this photo with my Rebel\".6) The better bokeh you by grabbing a FF camera is noticeable and great. If you like bokeh then you will love this camera (just be sure to link it up with some fast glass).Otherwise, there's not much to say. You can probably tell I love the camera and I of course love my lens. If you don't have very much money I'd say grab this with the kit lens (24-105) since it's a well-reviewed lens but if you have some money to spend I would skip that and go for 1 or 2 primes if you can.Feel free to peruse through some photos of mine on my blog (photos taken with the 5D are labelled as such): [...]", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "5D MK III Canon's  Best FF Camera Available (Until 1DX!!)", "Author": "Rikki Lee \"happy man\"", "ReviewID": "R14NWR5UVJBBVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am blown away with the new Canon 5D MK III.

I took some pictures with only a 30 watt bulb lighting up the room and it would still focus on pretty much anything.The high ISO capabilities and quality at high ISO's is nothing short of astounding! Not only is the high ISO quality great, but I love, love, love the QUALITY of the noise. I have read it several times and I do concur - the noise on the 5D III is film like -it looks more like grain than noise.I have provided a link with RAW images showing its phenomenal high ISO capabilities (it also compares dynamic range vs the Nikon D800). I would have no hesitation shooting at ISO 12,800 - it is that good as the following link will show.[...]With a little cleaning up, the images are very, very, usable IMO.Admittedly, I still have a lot to discover. AF and High ISO were at the very top of my list, so naturally, that is what I explored first.When it comes to photography (I am a professional) I am pretty old school.... bells and whistles don't matter to me as much as image quality... so I will discover more pros and cons as I learn and explore more.

There's a learning curve with this unit however it's nothing really crazy to overcome. I opted for the Vello battery grip instead the Canon one which suites me just fine. Now with the grip the camera is more balanced with my 70-200 2.8 and the 100-400 glass. I just love the overall feel. The shutter is so much quieter than the 5D Mark II and hitting that shutter button and the overall camera has a more professional feel to it...if I can say that.

My 7D met my needs, it was sturdy, it took great pictures and it felt good in my hands. However, as I got further and further into photography I started to notice its limitations. At high ISO's I was seeing too much noise and a 1.6 APSC sensor meant I just wasn't using all of the glass my lenses had to offer.So, I bit the bullet and upgraded to the 5D III with the intent of holding on to my 7D as a second body.Put it this way, 3 weeks after buying the 5D, I sold my 7D. Except for losing some frames per second (8 vs 6), the 5D bested my 7D in everything that was important to me. It shot better in low light, the pictures just popped and (while initially overwhelming) the massive number of focus points meant I could focus and not have to recompose.Some people complain about the visible \"lack of reach\" between a full frame (1D, 5D) and crop frame (Rebel, 7D) camera when using the same lens-- but I actually liked this. I shoot mainly landscapes and suddenly I could fit in massive swathes of scenery I wasn't able to get in a single picture before. I was able to use my lenses as they were designed.I haven't found any issues that make me regret selling my 7D.

I sold all of my gear hoping to purchase a Nikon D4. That didn't happen so I got what I thought was the next best thing. Boy was I wrong! I honestly think that for the way in which I use a camera, I purchased the best camera available. The key here is \"the way in which I use the camera\". I'm not trying to start any arguments as to what is a better camera between Canon and Nikon. That being said, I shoot sports photography at an amature level, weddings and other events professional and also do professional video work. Like many of you, I hope, I did a ton of research on everything that was coming out in an effort to make an informed decision. Unfortunately, much of what I read seemed to be very biased. Having had the 5D Mark III now for about 2 weeks, I can tell you that I haven't even scratched the surface in terms of its abilities but, I am blown away with every shot that I take and every video that I capture.This is not a camera for someone who doesn't like to read. There are about 450 pages or do in the manual that need to not only be read but understood. Taking a simple picture is easy and doesn't require as much planning but, you do need to know how to use both your camera and your lens. From some, not all, of the images that I have taken with the camera, I can tell you that it is a H U G E, let me spell it again a H U G E improvement over the Nikon D700 that I recently sold which should be the case considering this is using new technology. Anyway, the pictures really are 3D-Like. The colors are phenomena! Different from Nikon but just really good for my purposes. I'll be honest, I haven't yet gotten an understanding of the new auto focusing system yet. I keep telling myself that If I want to be considered a pro, I should probably be using manual anyway. None-the-less, I continue to try to read and re-read the manual to gain a better understanding.One of the surprises that I didn't recall reading about as it relates to the autofocus system is that not al lens are designed to take full advantage of the new system. This is where knowing how to use your lens comes in handy. The manual does provide a detailed breakdown of what lenses can do what as it relates to the focusing system. For me coming from Nikon to this camera as you might imagine was a nightmare in terms of learning how to actually manipulate the camera controls. For current Canon shooters, I don't see this as an issue.For Nikon guys like me, yes, I am still a Nikon guy, I just happen to be a Canon guy too. But as I was saying, for anyone moving from Nikon to Canon, you will have to be patient and allow yourself to become familiar with this camera and its ergonomics. The camera feels good in my hand, the buttons for the most part are within reach. Every now and then, I need to look at the top of the camera as I try to recall where certain features are. The 6 Frames per second are somewhat disappointing but only because I had my heart set on the 11 FPS on the Nikon D4 but this doesn't in anyway change the way I feel about this camera. I new that it was 6FPS when I purchased it. Attaching lenses is simple. Coming from the Nikon world, I actually don't have any issues with selecting a specific focus point as I know other who didn't seems very comfortable with it. The battery doesn't last very long on video mode but then again, neither does a 16GB card. Oh, and let me offer this...the video mode has two different setting that you can shoot in. One is called ALL-I and the other is called IPB.The first thing I wanted to know is what does this mean, ALL-I and IPB. I actually still don't now but what I do know is that the ALL-I mode is supposed to offer easier editing due to it's less compressed nature whereas the IPB mode actually compresses the image and allow that 16GB card that I mentioned earlier to store more footage. I haven't personally seen a difference in footage that matters to any client that I have. These other guys and girls that are making Hollywood movies might disagree but again, for my purposes, I see no difference and if I gave you a DVD, you would love it or hate it without ever knowing which mode I filmed in.As far as the video quality, what more can one guy say. If this camera were, a woman, and were single, I'd propose. I love the image quality of this camera. I actually picked up a 5D Mark II a couple days before getting this camera and wasn't as blown away. I actually like the 7D for video better. That's another discussion for another time. For anyone holding on to a 5D Mark II because of what others are saying, I say go rent one and test it out for yourself. Make your own decision; after all, it's your money. Now to be fair, I am not and was not invested in the 5D Mark II so I may be looking at this at a different perspective than some but, if you have a chance to get this camera, get it and see for yourself. Oh and a couple of other quick points. I had heard that Canons don't focus well in low light, I had heard that Canons don't focus fast, I heard all sorts of things and let me tell you...I have no problem with the low light nor do I have an issue with the focusing speed.In conclusion, I love this camera and hope you will too.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lower price on Canon 5D Mark III", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R27RPXPKMU7VGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been researching and wanting to purchase a Canon 5D Mark III, understanding it addresses many of the issues I have experienced with my Canon 5D Mark II over the past couple of years.

I started with the D60 then got the 1Ds and last owned the 1Ds III.  Each was a step up in color quality, detail and features.  I got the 5D III to get live view, better low light performance, and I hoped for better autofocus.  Here are the biggest improvements I have found.1.  Color.  The color of the 1Ds III was very good.  The D60 was good but seemed artificial.  The 1Ds was much better.  The 1Ds III was as good as the 1Ds but smoother due to the higher MP and had more detail.  But as good as the 1Ds III was its images were not quite real.  I often fussed with the color in post processing and ultimately got good rich detailed color but as good as it got you often knew you were looking at a photo.  The 5D III has even better color and approaches a sense of seeing the real thing.  One of the most powerful features of photography is freezing reality and revealing details we miss in the flow of perception.  Shots taken with the 5D III grab more than any other camera I have used.  It is like seeing the real thing suspended in time, not a photograph of the real thing.  The effect is subtle and hard to describe but quite impressive.  I rarely adjust color post processing with the 5D III except shots taken in low artificial light.  The camera just nails it.2.  Autofocus.  One thing that bugged me about the 1Ds III was the autofocus.  It too often missed, especially in close ups and shooting wide angle at infinity.  The D60 was really bad in that sense as well.  The 5D III fixes that problem completely.  It has a very versatile system but just shooting spot focus on the center square almost always gets it right on.  This is the first time I have gotten really sharp telephoto shots of kids playing and even more impressive now is close ups with the new 24-70 II zoom.3.  Live view.  This is a great feature for shooting with mirror lock up.  Focus is slow so it doesn't work for shooting kids or anything else moving but is great for landscape shots.4.  Low light.  Best in class.  The new Nikons are reported to be better in the shadows but I have no complaints.  The 1Ds III only went to ISO 1600.  The 5D III goes much higher.  With the 1Ds III ISO 400 was certainly useable but had noticeable grain.  There is hardly any grain in the 5D III up to ISO 800.I have not shot the new Nikons but I will say without reservation that the 5D III with the new Canon zooms, especially the new 24-70, is state of the art.  It has also finally sunk in that bodies, even the very best, become outdated after a few years.

The camera's engineering and ergonomics were awesome and it produced some great images for me.  However, that full-frame sensor on the 5D has been calling my name ever since.  I sold the 7D on ebay last month and bought a Mark III.  If any 7D owner is wondering whether the upgrade is worth the price, I say absolutely.  The camera operates almost exactly like my 7D and so I had little or no learning curve.  In some ways, the interface is improved (sub-menus, for example).  The rear screen gives a better view of the finished picture.  So what did I get besides a camera that works as I expect?  Image quality.  In spades.  The full-frame sensor is magnificent, and with the 35MM 1.4L lens and the 2.8 24-70 L II lens, produces incredibly sharp, detailed images.  Seriously beautiful stuff.  The camera brings out the best in 'L' glass -- I see it in the images, but look at the DXO ratings for confirmation.  The 2.8 24-70 lens gives me better results in almost all shooting modes than I got on the 7D.  The extra usable ISO makes up for the lack of IS on the 2.8 lens -- but since grandchildren are often the subjects, IS is not much use anyway. The focus system is much more accurate and easily controlled and the images (I use RAW) require less post-processing than with the 7D. There will be some additional distortion and light falloff in the corners, but with LR, PS, or DXO these problems disappear on RAW images with the click of a button. I would often start editing a picture from the 7D and puzzle about what it needed to 'pop' -- the 5D's added dynamic range and its metering system produce images that are closer to 'right' at first look. I have far less need to adjust exposure, contrast, and WB than I typically did with the 7D.  An impressive pickup is the wider usable ISO range of the larger sensor.  I didn't want to go much above ISO 800 on the 7D because of noise, but I am getting several additional (3-4) stops before seeing much noise with the 5D.  This makes the camera almost perfect for indoors available-light shooting. So, I have a camera that is as familiar to me as my 7D, and as well-engineered, but produces significantly better images. While I wouldn't have been comfortable using the 7D in auto-ISO mode, I can do so with the 5D.  This body was twice the money of the 7D but is equally refined in terms of build quality, engineering, ergonomics, and the image quality of the 5D III matches the rest of the engineering. The sensor may not have the high pixel count of some of the Nikon's, but the sensor has artistic chops. It can produce breathtaking detail, sharpness, and color.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth the Upgrade- despite Error 20", "Author": "stephen young", "ReviewID": "R1493YT93K8VRJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned a Mark II..and was very impressed with the quality of the photos.

Previously, I spent several years with the x0D line of Canons, most recently the 50D, so this new model represents a substantial upgrade in terms of raw capabilities. Other reviewers have extensively discussed the many aspects of the 5DIII's overall handling, so I'll refrain from being repetitive.Upon taking the camera from the box, I excitedly placed a lens on the camera, turned it to my window and looked through the viewfinder. I was utterly dismayed. The view was dim and unfocused. I turned the focus ring of the lens to no avail. Something must be askew within the camera, I thought. I removed the lens, placed it on my 50D to be sure that it wasn't the lens. It wasn't. This wasn't good. To make a long story short, it turns out that the battery is necessary even with the camera turned off just to look through the viewfinder. With a charged battery in place, the image brightens and can easily be brought into focus. I've yet to see any discussion of this online and there is only a brief statement buried within the hundreds of pages of owner's manual; perhaps this is unchanged from the 5DII, but it sure represents a big difference from my old 50D. So - Step 1 - charge your battery and install it, then begin your exploration of the camera.My second issue came with my installation of Canon's software from their DVD onto my Mac Pro, on which I was running OS 10.6.8. I couldn't install the software. The installer would bounce once, then stop running, and that was the end of that. I had no problem installing the software on my laptop running Lion, or on an iMac running Lion, so I figured the software simply wouldn't work under 10.6.8. I bit the bullet and upgraded my Mac Pro to 10.7, only to find that the Canon software still wouldn't install, even after booting in Safe Mode. After several back-and-forth discussions with Canon Support, they suggested that I try logging in to my Mac Pro as a different user. I created a new Administrator that would have access to my applications folder, and behold, the software installed properly. I then needed to download several software upgrades from Canon, move those to the new user account, and install those, as they too would not work with my own account. I've never had a problem with Canon software installers and still have not found an explanation as to what's wrong or how to fix it. Canon stuck with me, though, until I got the workaround working. Some people asked me why I was bothering with Canon's software, given Lightroom, Aperture, Photoshop, and so forth. There are some aspects of Canon's software, however, that make certain activities easier. I like it for quick use of stitching photos together as well as for upgrading firmware in the camera. Your mileage may vary.Now I had camera operational and software installed. I installed two cards: the Lexar Professional 400x 128 GB SDXC UHS-I Card and the Lexar Professional 128 GB 400x UDMA7 CompactFlash Card. Both quickly formatted and have worked flawlessly since. I appear to have a impressive amount of storage room for raw photos and at least a sufficient amount of space for video, which I admit I have yet to explore. I've noticed a few things over the past weeks:1) The lack of a built-in flash is an improvement. I often found that my 50D would suddenly pop up its flash attachment when I least expected it. Yes, of course there are workarounds to that, and I used them at times when I really didn't want the flash to be used. But outside in the middle of the day, I wouldn't expect the flash unit to open up and hadn't bothered with the workaround. In any case, I greatly prefer the 5DIII's approach of simply adjusting the ISO to fit the need if I'm running in automatic mode (and sometimes I do). I'm more than happy to grab my flash unit if I want to take flash pictures. Maybe it's because I trained with a Contax II and was limited to occasional use of a heavy flash attachment and Press 40 flashbulbs that I find myself being perfectly comfortable without a flash, but I truly feel that this leaves the choice of flash/no-flash to me every time without my having to give it a second thought.2) Never once in years of use did my mode dial turn by itself. I see no need for a locking mode dial and find it a very minor annoyance, particularly when my hands are full while trying to take photos in active situations.3) I'm not particularly comfortable with the interface of the enlarge button. With the x0D, you push the button repetitively to get to the level of enlargement desired on the screen. With the 5DIII, you push it once, then use the dial to adjust the level of enlargement. Pushing the button a second time simply returns you to the full image. The number of steps hasn't changed, but the need to move from button to dial has been added. I'm not clear as to why that added step is now necessary.4) This part IS repetitive - low light photos are impressive. With a Canon EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS lens, set to 300mm, I took a photo of the moon, adjusted the exposure by several stops to correct the overexposure, then again shot a photograph. Handheld. At ISO 12,800. And the photo looks good. Taking pictures in a dark room by the light of an iPad, or by the flickering light of a TV, or by candlelight - all possible while retaining the mood, with minimal noise, and without need of a tripod. And again, having grown up with ASA 25 Kodachrome and having had the thrill of occasionally pushing Tri-X beyond its ASA 400 baseline capability, this truly is a whole new world.5) I do miss the ability to replace the focusing screen, as I always did in the 0xD line. I miss ground glass, and I really miss split-prisms. The 5DIII viewfinder is ALMOST as good as the viewfinder in my Pentax Super Program. It IS as bright and very nearly as large, but I really can't manually focus without the proper tools in a film-based SLR. The KatzEye or equivalent split-prism focus screens come close (though lacking the ground glass), but now I'm totally reliant on autofocus. So far, the 5DIII hasn't let me down in that respect, and is far better than my 50D was in low light or low contrast situations. But I'd jump ship in a moment if a competitor came out with a similar camera that had a viewfinder like those from my Pentax days.Overall, I've been thrilled with the first few \"rolls\" of photos that I've taken with the 5DIII. The camera feels right in my hand - a marked improvement from the 50D. The little rubber doors for the USB port open and close with ease, moving out of the way for cabling as needed in a manner superior to that of the 50D. And I'm working my way through the hefty manual without too much difficulty.

It really helps to both shoot incognito as well as get candid shots without immediately alerting the subject that their picture is being taken.  In this way, you can take multiple shots before a subject realizes.

Yes I realize high pixel count doesn't make a sharper image or give one better composition... but if one chooses to shoot jpeg the 5DMKIII STARTS at 21megapixels and delivers stunning 9-10 MB jpeg images. It simply has more to work with out of the gate.I like the two-card set up that allows me to shoot and have in-camera backup. The GLASS LCD is clean and crisp and the menu system is relatively quick and intuitive. I do wish it had onboard flash... yes it will produce images at absurdly high ISOs but every now and then a fill-in flash is handy to have. Haven't used the HDR mode much yet since use of a tripod is recommended (I shoot hand-held most of the time). Can't comment on the 1080p video either; I didn't buy it for that.According to folks like Ken Rockwell this is the world's best DSLR and I don't disagree with him. One has to weigh whether the cost is justified when compared to say the new 6D. It all comes down to your personal workflow and field needs. If a one-card system with fewer focus points will work for you, the 6D ALMOST the same camera for about $1,200-$1,500 less.I personally am happy with the 5DMKIII. It fits my needs.

Thanks for the effective micro focus adjustment. High ISO is usable all the way to 12800, which is smoother than the ISO 800 of 5D mark I! The jpeg output is very amazing, sharp and vivid. I am not the one who have the patience to do post-processing in front of the computer for hours. 5D mark III allow me to get the perfect shot right from the camera without processing. 100% viewfinder, speedy AF, 61 points AF tracking, mouth-opening high ISO performance, continuous shooting like a machine gun, super-fast digic processor that save photos in top speed. It also has the right weight to support those heavy L lens and the grip and handling are perfect. The quiet mode for shutter is a plus. The only thing that distract me is the Rate button, that I feel is not needed. However, I remember I can program it to do something else.

Lopez \"BobbyL\"", "ReviewID": "R2OHTRH5AUJZ16", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm coming from 15 years on the Nikon system and I have to say that the meters on the canon's are much easier to fool with mixed brightness compositions than my nikon ever was. The first unit I got was metering 1-2 stops under exposed based on my histogram readings. I've since returned that unit and got another. It still shoots dark but it's a bit better. I've seen lots of people complain about this online with the compromise being a +1/3-2/3 stops over exposure compensation on all the time. There's just no excuse for that in a camera of this caliber.To be fair, Nikon does have a tendency to over-expose but I find it easier to recover some bright areas and keep the detail than I find it to boost the shadows and exaggerate the noise in those shadows. Since I sold all my Nikon gear, that's just the compromise I'm gonna have to live with.The rear LCD scratches easily so I recommend you buy a screen protector made of high quality glass and install it on day 1. That's another thing that just comes free with a Nikon body.The camera shoots like a champ all the way up to ISO 3200. It can do well at ISO 6400 but you better get the exposure spot on or you'll get lot of noisy shadows if you under expose your RAW files and make adjustments in your preferred RAW converter. My old nikon D300s started to scream \"uncle!\" if I get anywhere near ISO 3200. I know the D800 is a low light champ but 36mp is overkill for my needs. I'd rather save the hard drive space.Another issue I've seen is in the red channel. This is also something I've seen mentioned a lot on forums. Shooting the new red tulips that are popping up all over NYC produces mixed results. The red is way over saturated at the default settings and the details are washed away because of it.Over all this is a great camera but it's not perfect by any means, no camera is. I couldn't give it a full 5 star rating because of some of the issues I laid out here. Don't let that hold you back though. This camera has allowed me to get shots that I never though I could before. The shallow depth of field with the new 24-70 f2.8 is simply breathtaking.

I'm upgrading from a Canon 50D which I have loved the past 3.5 years. This is a stellar piece of equipment, more so than I expected (and I expected a lot)!I have now used it for about a week, and have found that there is a little learning curve to upgrade, but it's well worth it. Here are some of my observations:* Image quality is fantastic. This should be expected from a full frame DSLR with L quality lens. I had heard that the 24-105 is good, but not great for L lenses. But I have found the sharpness, colors, and bokeh to be outstanding.* This camera feels like a tank. My old 50D felt really good and strong, and took a bit of a beating, but never missed a beat. The 5D mark iii feels much more sturdy, so I know it will hold up to many years of use in wet, cold, snow, sand, woods, and a toddler.* The shutter is so much quieter than the 50D, even went NOT using the silent shutter mode. The mirror slap is very quiet (maybe not Nikon quiet, but close). I feel like I can be stealthier with this camera.* The auto focus is amazing. This is especially true with the 1.2.1 firmware. It's so fast to lock on that I often find myself second guessing if it got the lock. And the AI servo mode tracks spectacularly well.* The buttons are WAY more programable than I expected. There is a menu option that lets you change the functions of EIGHT different buttons. This includes the newly placed DOF preview button, which I never used as a DOF preview, so I'm glad it's no longer useless. It's definitely taking me a bit of time to get used to the new layout (especially the left side buttons), but I'm sure it won't be long until it's natural.* The bracketed exposures can be set to 2, 3, 5, or 7 exposures! This is great news for me, as I like to take shots for HDR merges. I always found it annoying to mess with the exposure settings to get a series of 7 shots. Using this, I could go -8 1/3 to + 8 1/3 with just holding down the shutter once. That is a huge range!* Using the electronic level in the viewfinder is a little tricky. It's much easier in live view mode. This could make for a bit of a drain on the battery, although...* Battery life is outstanding. So far, I have taken 359 shots, and the battery is at 70%. At this rate, I would get approximately 1200 images before depleting the battery. And this is with a lot of image review, settings, etc. So the battery life could be much longer if I wasn't in the menus so much.* Vignetting is the one major downside I have to contest with. Because I shoot RAW, I have to handle it in post processing. It's not the worst thing, but it is a bit of a pain. This is to be expected wit ha full frame camera and a wide lens.Overall I am extremely pleased!", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "5D Mark III AWESOME", "Author": "Carlos Tab", "ReviewID": "R3L6A1ZR0ENW4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, coming from Nikon I have to say this is the best camera I have ever used.

(in 35mm days I was a Nikon guy.) The 5DIII is my favorite - it just feels \"right\". The button positions and functions all work as I expect them. You can customize many functions through the menus so I could make it feel like I wanted it to.In the last year, I've taken a bit over 10,000 frames, including a wedding and a trip to Europe.I find the additional light metering points and control to be very useful and is much better than that 5DII.I find the auto focus works far better and faster than the 5DII as well (using the same Canon L lenses). Even in tough situations it  gets that razor-sharp focus point right where I want it when I push the button. When it doesn't its invariably my fault, and many times when it would be my fault it gets it right anyway.The low-light capabilities are STUNNING (and very handy!) - I routinely shoot at 6400 and even 12500 ISO. In fact, this camera lets you FIX the aperture AND the speed and then it adjusts the ISO. I've used this capability at stage performances and when shooting children - instances when I needed speed and DOF, but the light levels were flipping all over the place.  You can also set a limit to how HIGH it will let the ISO go (over 12,500 I find that noise gets too high for some uses). This prevents unpleasnt surprises later.The quality of the RAW files is superb. (SIDEBAR: I don't bother with JPEG's anymore. It is just too easy to shoot raw, load it into Adobe Lightroom, zip through doing crop and adjustments, and then export to whatever sized JPEGS I need. Using RAW has let me resolve many color balance problems (mixed light sources) and has allowed me to bring back detail in shadows and highlights that would have been lost in JPEGS.The self-cleaning sensor has yet to miss a spec of dust, which is saying a lot, since I'm continually having to clean the sensor on my 5DII and my 20D's (yes, I still use them from time to time.)I bought this primarily for the \"silent shutter\" mode for use at my daughter's wedding. I've found that amazingly helpful when shooting people, but the real upgrade is in the focus, metering and sensor quality.VERY MUCH worth the investment (well, ok, the expenditure, since my only real return is great pleasure in getting the photos I want.)", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "An excellent camera!!", "Author": "B.

I got hooked on photography so then I decided to invest on this \"semi-pro\" model. So this review is intened for those like me, beginners.1) Its much heavier that the Rebel series; and noticably larger too.  I get the feeling that its more delicate despite the fact that it is definatley better built. Maybe its the price I paid for it but I get the feeling that if I drop it even a few inches it will break. (I hope I never test this theory). On the other hand my lighter Rebel was treated like an old book and never once gave me problems.2) Dont expect to be able to use any EF-S lenses that you might have purchased, ( I knew this before I bought mine but I want to make sure everyone understands this). The camera only uses EF lenses (as opposed to EF-S). The quality of these lenses is much better, especially the L series that the kit comes with. Again, these lenses are also considerably larger.3) The full size APS sensor DEFINATELY makes a positive difference.  Expect to see more of the picture but with less zoom (because of the full type sensor).4) On full auto mode picture just come out better.  It definately makes a huge difference when taking pictures in dim areas.5) There is no built in flash on this camera, you have to buy one if you need it. Or you can use the ones you might have purchased before.  You should use Canon ETTL lenses for best results. Anything less and the camera does not have the ability to control its brightness. This usually results in pictures that are too bright.6) Be prepared to use at least 8GB SD cards. The larger sized pictures and its 6 pics per second abilities fills up your card pretty fast.  I never had a problem with my Rebel and 4gb cards.  The larger sized pictures however definately make a big quality improvement.I am still getting used to this larger and heavier camera  but it was definately worth every penny.  The batter life is comparable to Rebel, the menu system is way more complicated but most functions are accessible via some extra buttons.  I find changing most normal settings (White balance, aperature, shutter speed etc much faster).The videos this camera takes are outstanding, so for a photographer like me this is a great bonus.

Where I used to have to take 5 or more pictures of a single opportunity in hope of stumbling over a keeper with my 5DII, now every picture simply is perfect.  ISO performance is incredible and noise is great even at ISO 6400, this opens up so many new avenues that were simply not there.

Philip Bloom, Martin Bailey, Neil van Niekerk and others), I knew it was time to pull the trigger.Having spent the last two weeks shooting photos and video, I am completely impressed by the capabilities of this camera, and the quality of photos and video that come out of it.My biggest surprise was when I hooked up the camera up to my 55\" LED LCD TV.

I love the Canon glass and the photos that the 5D Mk II produces.  So when the 5DMk III was announced, I ordered it - even at the steep price of $3,500.00 USD.  I like the way Canon delivers their products soon after the announcement - wish Nikon did the same, but I digress.  I've been using it now for a couple of weeks.  There are several things I like about the newest 5D Gen:1. The Auto Focus is much faster in actual use.  Setting it up is another matter.2. The locking mode switch is nice - Canon charged me $100.00 to mod my 5DMk II for this feature.3.  There is in- camera correction of chromatic aberration (CA) and vignetting of select lenses .  Why Canon didn't install this in the camera out of the box is questionable.  You have to load software and manually select the lenses from a list and install them into the camera YOURSELF.  While not a problem for most people, with a price tag of $3,500.00 USD, why not spare us that drill?  Just saying.  There are some older lenses missing from the list too (oh well.)4.  The on-off switch is now on top of the camera instead of at the bottom - this is a big plus for me at least.  In my clumsiness I often inadvertently switched the 5DMk II off when pulling it out of the bag.5.  I like the location of the Depth-of-Field (DOF) preview button - now I only need one hand to preview and shoot (thanks Canon!)6.  I haven't done any scientific testing of either camera, but I do see a bit of improvement in the Image Quality in the 5D Mk III, and the low-light images are far better - this is probably due to the re-working of the sensor.7.  This is totally subjective:  It just feels better in my hands.This all adds up to an incrementally better camera than the 5D Mk II.  But it's not the \"game-changer\" that the original 5D was.  The 5 D Mk III is not a \"revolutionary\" model.  It's a lovely upgrade from the 5D Mk II, but there's really no compelling reason to ditch your 5D Mk II and switch to the 5 D Mk III.  I have the feeling that the Nikon D800 has stolen the thunder of the 5D Mk III, and will cause many people to jump ship - simply because the D800 IS a major game changer and it IS REVOLUTIONARY, while the 5D Mk III just isn't.  By the way, I've already ordered my D800 (sorry Canon.)I have one major complaint with my 5DMk III and that is that I cannot save the Custom 1, 2, 3 features I want.  This can probably be fixed in a subsequent firmware update, but it's been a royal pain for me in the meantime.  I was able to save one Custom setting, and I have not been able to add C2 and C3.

Again, very happy with the 5D, but there are a few things I miss about my Nikon and bug me about the 5D.1)  No on camera flash (pop-up).  For the most part, these small on camera flash units are of little value.  However, there are times when you need just a hint of light to fill in a shadow or balance an exposure.  While I thought I would not miss it, turns out I was wishing for it the first time I used my 5D.  Ended up bringing in another light for my shoot, but I know I could have saved some time and used the flash if I had my Nikon.  Probably my biggest issue with the 5D.2) I really liked the position and feel of the front / back thumb wheels on my Nikon.  Making exposure adjustments with my index finger and thumb was quick and easy on my Nikon.  After two weeks of solid use, I still find myself trying to use a rear thumb wheel on the 5D (that isn't there).  Yes there is a wheel on the back of the 5D but it's not the same style / location as my Nikon.  Not sure if this will just take time to get over but so far, just does not feel quite as ergonomic on the Canon.3) The lock on the shooting mode wheel.  While I understand why Canon did this, still not quite used to it.  Find myself having to use two hands to change the setting from Tv to Av, etc.It's only been a few weeks that I have had the 5D, and maybe I'll get used to these things.

I feel like this camera is glued to my little hand - and yes, I have tiny feminine hands... and this big camera is just stuck in them!

The majority of those pictures came from low light environments.  The first event was a Halloween safe night for a local town. I used my 24-70mm f2.8 and 580ex II flash.  The only time I found the 5d3 seeking focus was when I was outside in the dark with barely any street light.  Had no issues inside a dimly lit fellowship hall with a fog machine going.  ISO4000 and some ISO5000.  If there is any digital noise in my images it is minimal.  Very acceptable and much better than my 50d at ISO800.  If there is any noise, it's like a very, very fine grain and there is still a lot of detail in the face.The next situation was at a high school stadium at night.  I usually use my 50d along with my 24-70mm 2.8 lens, but when I rented the 5d3 I had also rented the 70-200mm f2.8.  Fantastic combo!  Focus system did well and I used the camera to capture our marching band performance and photos of seniors and their parents.  So many shots I would have either not gotten or had to have thrown away due to the struggle that my 50d seems to have in a low light environment. I was very impressed and now would also love to own the 70-200mm.What made me really love this camera was shooting Bandmasters in Memphis, a big marching band competition.  I shot using my 100-400mm lens throughout the entire competition.  After dark I was still able to use the lens.  This was at The Liberty Bowl in Memphis and lighting is much better there than in the high school football stadium.  At ISO4000 using the 100-400mm most times I was able to get a shutter speed close to 1/400 or higher at f8. This varied if the uniforms were darker or lighter, but I was really impressed with the sharpness and how much less digital noise I saw in the images than my 500d at ISO800.I've had my 50d over 4 years now and this 5d3 really brought the quality of my photography to a whole new level.

The LED screen on the top of the camera near the shutter release feels a bit redundant to me after only using the LCD screen and viewfinder in the T2i to adjust camera settings. I like the fact that the LED screen shows how many shots I have left on my cards, however as I am using two 32GB memory cards so the reading on the LED screen is never accurate. I feel Canon could have done without this little piece of vanity.Overall however, I am entirely satisfied with this camera and in no way regret the investment.Anyone wanting to take that serious leap in to photography and has the extra money to spend on this over the Canon 6D, I would greatly recommend this.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this Camera", "Author": "Mike C", "ReviewID": "RE33K49NHA6YU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To be fair, I was coming from a six year old Rebel XTi but I find this camera magical. Combined with L lenses the clarity and quality of the shots makes reviewing a shoot sort of like Christmas every time. My keepers shooting little league went up to probably 20% (darn fence) and for football it might go as high as a third if I'm doing a good job.The ISO performance is superb with even as high as 3200-6400 being plenty good for the average viewer. Anything under 1600 is tack sharp with the right lens. The speed is also fine for kids sports although I highly recommend only using a fast CF card when doing so. Even the fastest SD can't keep up with the buffer. Lots of other folks have gone over the gory details but I'll just say that I have no regrets despite the price.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect DSLR", "Author": "Cc's Mom", "ReviewID": "R22LSI5IUOZBH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the Canon 5D Mark III from the original 5D. The quality of the pictures from the 5D classic are still incredible but the autofocus was very limiting while trying to keep up with my one year old after he started walking. I could no longer use the focus and recompose because by the time I did my son would be ten feet away. I finally made the plunge and purchased the 5D Mark III.All I can say is WOW! The auto focus is fast and accurate. The high iso capabilities compared to the classic is astonishing and allows me to do more than I ever thought I could with a camera. While it is true that the photographer not the camera makes great images, it certanitly doesn't hurt to have a great tool to work with. The camera has rejuvenated my passion for photography instead of feeling frustrated when I would miss pictures due to poor auto focus. This camera will meet all of my needs for many years to come.Pros:- Great Auto focus- Image quality- 6 fps- Excellent high iso performance. Not afraid to shoot at iso 6400- Good Ergonomics- Build quality- Refined compared to the 5D classicCons:- Price. Paid $3250 on sale.- No auto focus for video. I don't shoot video but it will probably keep me from using it.- Slow SD card write speed. SD cards are much cheaper than CF cards.Conclusion:If you don't need the improved auto focus I would probably go for the 5D Mark II or even the 5D classic. For myself that was the biggest selling feature and it is why I skipped the 5D Mark II despite it's many other improvements over the original.

Concepcion", "ReviewID": "R3R5DDXQL3T04F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a user not a professional review. Otherwise, I'd suggest go to dpreview.com or your preferred reference. I think they are capable of showing evidence of issues such as vignetting or chromatic abberration in a product that could get the attention of the manufacturer's engineering department.  They helped or convinced me with the purchase.  My intention is to give feedback on the couple of points they've raised and highlight what I've experienced as a user so far.I agree that this camera performs excellent at 12,800 ISO or even higher. At f/4, this allowed me to shoot handheld and flipped the mirror in a fraction of second.  The almost black sky showed the clouds in the captured image which was not visible to my eye (my vision is 20/20). At some situations, you can have a 4L lens function at 2.8L.  I was going for the new 24-70mm 2.8L but I had to wait 2 months for the 5D body only so I went for the kit. I guess it's a good accident.I am pleased with the new 61-point AF. Fast and gets my focus right most of the time so far. What I mean by fast is less than half a second or probably faster than that. I could catch a bird flying within my frame without exciting some nerves.  I won't mention how the new AF system works.  The pros could discuss this all day.  What's important is that when you use AF you can capture a nice pic fast without going for MF or manually controlling the exposure. I was able to produce a silky background blur consistently (1 foot away from subject) with AF using the kit lens. Nevertheless, if you bought this camera you would find the MF as sweet or sweeter than the AF.35mm camera these days can do still and motion pictures but not excellent at both worlds in my opinion. 5D3's video is handsomely good but if you spent $3500, I think you wouldn't mind going a little further and buy a possibly lighter, smaller and more than capable video cam and get the 1080p/60fps.  Pros I've met use their SLRs mainly for shooting still pictures.  However, its video performance can be used in some production in my opinion as it's way too good for the end user.The manual states that this 5D does not comply with the Ultra High Speed memory cards but SDHC/SDXC can be used. I guess Canon is referring to writing at 95MB/s.  I used the SDHC (600x) it worked just fine but I'm noticing some delay (around 1/4 second) when flipping images in the LCD.  It might be normal.  I will try the CF (600x too) and see the diffence. If you're considering to get the latest and greatest like 1000x you might want to wait a little while.  Canon might release a newer firmware and make it fully compliant with UHS.  Fast cards need fast writer too.  Having both CF and SD is winner for me.  Saving money on cards (unless CF and SD cost and perform the same) but achieving the same thing. Record to both or use one then switch.  Don't have to worry losing the images or clips and backing up to the laptop regularly unless somebody steals the camera or I dropped it above the mariana trench.22M pixels is more than enough I believe unless you print posters or billboards. It's too big for me already.  Large prints consume 10MB in the card. I don't see much difference shooting lower (12) than 22M pixels. Noise seems to show faster and noticeable at higher pixels and ISO.Physically, it's ergonomic and the buttons are placed almost perfectly. Kenrockwell articulated this well and I agree with him that 5D3 is the best well rounded SLR that Canon ever made.  However, I disagree when he compared the D4 and 5D.  It's like comparing BMW's SUV with Audi's sedan. Anyway, when I first lifted 5D3 the thumb, index, and middle finger put a groove in the grip. I'm 5 foot 8. Fits my right hand perfectly. The battery compartment has an internal lock - ensures pins remain in contact and it gets more secure as you put your hand around the grip. The camera is not heavy I would say but with the lens and the first all day shooting I felt the weight.Not sure why Canon did not go for USB 3. 128GB CF/SD will be a norm soon.  Imagine taking hours transferring files to your computer via USB 2 where it could take in minutes.  This is my biggest disappoinment.  The touch pad is like the egyptian table compared to iPhone and it's a bit redundant with the track ball (above the Q button).  I saw some cosmetic imperfection around the mode dial. It looks like a dent. If you notice this, please let me know. The top LCD looks to have a protective film but not the 3.2 LCD. I can't find anyone selling screen protector so I ordered the ones for the iPhone. I will cut and fit when it arrives.In summary, excellent ISO, AF, ergonomic. Best form factor out there for full 35mm SLR for me - I shoot outside and under the roof. No flash which is a plus for me - makes camera smaller and you won't need it most of the time if you have good lens but if you do, you wouldn't want the built-in flash.  I have a couple of minor issues but the thing still deserves 5 stars.I will post some pics.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 5D Mark III", "Author": "Buzz4", "ReviewID": "R3K5F0H1E1CLWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this model to take over where the Canon 1Ds worked perfectly using the EF 28-300 3.5-5.6 L IS USM lens mostly.  It departs in may ways with great improvements in the higher megapixel, quieter shutter noise and video/audio recording. I needed the camera to be quiet and could not believe the 1Ds was SO noisy.  Could not use in recitals or shooting creatures.  The EOS 5D Mark III has so much desirable and few things a bit awkward starting with the mode dial locking button.  Didn't need to have 2 functions to rotate the dial that previous models for the most part omitted.  The set button changes not only the touch pad changes but also the multi-controller toggle button that you need to drop down and hit the set button to confirm an action.  The CF card positions in the camera does not allow your finger/thumb nail to snag the CF edge lip since it faces the card slot cover.  I have to noodle around rather than use a thumb nail and pull out easily. Could be my \"basket ball palming\"size hands.FYI:  If you need Canon service out of warranty.  This new 5Dm3 gave contact errors with the 28-300 L lens the 1Ds didn't and noticed the lens mount was damaged but still would fire taking perfect shots.  I sent to Canon authorized facility in CA last week for the mount to be replaced and dust removed out of the front elements.  They quoted $435 and later changed it to $998(discounted to $804 after complaining) citing a stabilizer major repair plus what I wanted originally.  Canon cites a tier structure not visible to the public of billing with no way to order what you want but what they deem needing repair.  Your choice is to pay what they want or they will not repair it and send it back. This is America isn't it?  (Wish I could do that in my service business, dictate what and how much you will pay or else!). It was not clear what was included with various tiers and not at their service website for disclosure. Canon has great products but their authorized service is appalling to not do what consumers want but what they want to do.  I have zero confidence in their repair skills/service if this is how they charge consumers with out disclosure prior to sending gear to them.  I found out to late that the Canon original parts cost of a flange and rubber seal,  over-nighted would have been under $65.  Of course the cleaning of the front elements would have been excluded but the lens would have never left my house.  The lens had no other evidence of failure other than contacts not meeting and the damaged flange.  Now I will never be sure if the repair was actually needed, damaged in shipment to them or how long the lens will function since it was opened up and \"repaired\".  I lost major ground in Canon authorized services.  Be advised, don't freak out when \"what ever\" fails and start figuring out what you need. Study ALL your options before the \"bait and switch\" or mystery billing events tags your wallet! There are websites that offer everything you need for your out of warranty gear repair if you or someone is up to it.  Some of us have no problems with repairs and given the risk potential of strangers work, shipping and can do just as good.  Not everyone has endless funds and this lens was not cheap.Update Feb 26, 2014:  After back and forth with Canon in Irvin, CA and customer relations more \"damages\" were disclosed that seem to be their justification for the major service criteria.  The small surface scratch on the lens barrel from a 1943 bomber ride with my then 85 year old mother at 5000 feet with wind turbulence was the reason for the need to replace the lens barrel. Did not effect functionality and I earned and loved that scratch.  It was a paint scratch, not a dent, the camera and lens was never dropped and the zoom action was perfect, just fine.  That along with the stabilizer replacement and what I wanted, front elements cleaned and base mount replacement justified the second estimation of the $998.  Talking with customer relations dropped the labor cost to parts only charges.  The point is I needed the front elements cleaned and the base mount replaced and Canon in Irvin, CA found everything else and refused to do what I wanted/needed due to their high standards of not letting anything out the facility that did not meet their \"high\" standards of service.  All or none!  The owner of the property DID NOT have any say in what was going to be performed, zero.  With Canon services warranty or out of warranty gear the owner of the property has zero input to what is performed.  The web site does not give you a clue to anything you can expect and you will not learn anything until the item is shipped and gone through who knows how many Canon service hands, departments. The risk potential grows exponentially once it leaves your hands no matter what anyone says.  Again, before sending to any repair facility, Canon or not, in or out of warranty, be advised that what ever you thought you needed may be of no consequence to the party that receives your property and from then on it is OUT OF YOUR HANDS and WALLET.10 Mar 2014 update:  This camera (I love) comes with the EOS Digital Solution Disk Ver. 27.2. software.  You will not learn (until it's to late) that embedded in the ImageBrowser EX 1.0 utility (I use for only quick batch naming the files before transferring to the hard drive) is a Microsoft Silverlight component for web browser content functionality.  You will not have a choice to install if you want the ImageBrowser to work or run even though it allows you the choice to install. Select no and the software will not work! I did not install anything but the ImageBrowser Utility and EOS Utility to be able to connect the camera to the PC for direct viewing at screen resolution.  Wish there was another utility that allows camera to PC functionality without Canon/Microsoft tentacles. We are being lead into a very finite place where they can harvest what ever they bloody want. Any suggestions?I had no idea Canon and Microsoft partnered in this software development that has tremendous implications of data gathering through the browser into your system, OS, network. Canon I believe is now just one more security/privacy breach into lives tragically with your consent if you want it to work. To date I do not think there is software that can screen and control data collection that is sent to outside servers and still be online/connected.  There is just no way to go about our lives without some government/corporate intrusion sneaking in and stealing data without our knowing or understanding how they do it.  Very disappointed in Canon again for the growing \"us against them\" dynamic.  When the day comes and their gear is less than standard I'll move on and never look back!15 March 2014 update:  Buying Canon also means the potential of Canon services  with or without warranty and that makes Canon authorized services relative to any Canon product you buy.  Shipped Canon the lens insured 18 February, 2 business day delivery and learned yesterday they are waiting on parts for the repair.  This means the \"fast 7 day\" turn a round is also rhetoric.  There are three authorized Canon repair facilities in the United States and they do not have parts for a lens still being sold today, WOW! Lessons learned:1.  I could have taken my time and performed the repair(s) my self.2.  I needed to find out exactly what Canon authorized facilities do by calling them directly and getting a CLEAR understanding how they handle repairs and cost structuring BEFORE sending them anything. The Canon website will not give you any idea of anything specific, red flag #1.3.  I should have chosen a state that is more friendly for being a \"red (conservative)\" state if they are a \"blue (liberal)\" state. Kind of like Pelosi saying \"we need to pass it\" and pay for it before finding out what's in it, OMG! If you don't think that should be a factor so do I but here we all are, one big social/political/financial mess and no way out. Texas and California are rivals in every way, I have nothing to do with that. I just happen to live here after getting out of the Army.4.  I can't get my lens back not knowing the actual state it's in at the Irvin, CA facility. Either way I'm screwed. They know I have serious problems with the way this transaction is being handled, mishandled described in my reviews, calls to them and customer relations.5.  If the delay is related to \"teaching me a lesson\" at the Irvin facility for being a concerned consumer of their services, what else could go wrong once they send the lens back? That's $2400 for the lens, 6 years of use, $609.93 for repair parts equals $3000+ and no assurances the lens will ever perform without issues again. At least they market having \"high standards\", what ever that means?6.  Since the Canon $609.93 repairs are just for parts, do you think Canon in Irvin, CA are happy or resentful towards me and going to do a good job on the lens repairs or a good job on me? If I live where the cost of living is very reasonable and every thing in California is BLOODY high, what do you think I'll pay for?7.  I know I'm screwed on this transaction with the Canon authorized facility in Irvin, CA.  If it turns out well, I'll say so, if it doesn't I'll say so. At least any and all that read and learn from my experience will know Canon authorized services has nothing to do with Canon quality in what they manufacture from the factory no matter the marketing rhetoric.  I still love Canon products. Their services at least in Irvin, CA. are completely out of touch with regular, average people just wanting to be treated actually like they appreciate and value me beyond empty, hollow, human less, impersonal rhetoric. I  trusted them to help me not help them selves!May 11, 2014 update: Canon received my complaint from the Ca. DOJ AG office and denies over charging for a repair(s) I did not want. They stated my \"rather old\" 7 year old lens had been damaged and needed the additional repairs. A lens 7 years old is NOT rather old but actually rather still new given how long high quality gear last. I have a 1953 German made camera that works perfectly and even that is not \"rather old\" compared to older functioning gear.They did not address at all how they would only fix everything THEY wanted repaired or send it back and not even clean the front elements or replace the damaged base mount. They also state since they found it needed additional parts that they provided them for \"free\". Of course the $609.93 parts charge had at least a 300% markup I had no choice in paying for in order to get my \"rather old\" lens back. This response I received from Canon U.S.A. was from their Senior Counsel.The bottom line is DO NOT SEND your Canon out of warranty gear to any Canon Service facility unless you don't care what they do. Again, once they have your property you will not have control of what you want repaired and they can do what ever they want with your property once they get it in their money grabbing hands. I guess since California is financially underwater literally, this is a way to increase revenue, gulp, gulp! YOU will have to pay for anything they say it needs or they will send the lens back unrepaired! Send your gear to a state that is not in a financial wreck and that has a better record for consumer product sales and service. California as beautiful as it is will never get another dime of mine unless there is no other worldly choice, sorry.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it but I don't love it.", "Author": "Soclr \"Soclr\"", "ReviewID": "R1DJJF6GAXVV38", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a full time pro wedding photographer.

Their lightweight bodies and spectacular glass equaled an amazing combination that shines through in the images I took. As a matter of fact, Olympus is known for saying that the 4/3 sensor produces images that are of a quality that's more than enough for what most photographers need. I can attest to the truth of this statement. However, over time this system became not enough for what I came to need. Eventually, I outgrew the equipment. That fact, coupled with many comparisons of images taken with full frame cameras from several manufacturers, sparked my interest in the Canon 5D MKIII specifically. From the onset of handling the MKIII it's quality is apparent. It screams of a certain rare capability, ergonomic usefullness and build that, to my eye, altogether is stunningly beautiful. From its deep grip to the broadness of its shoulders to the sleek curvature of it's pentaprism hump the 5D MKIII is everything that the MKII desired to be. The ergonomics are superb and all of the proper buttons either click or pleasantly mush as need. For example, the shutter button effortlessly presses through past the focusing point, almost floating down. Then, devoid of any discernible interruption, the shot breaks. This fluidity, without the commonplace \"click\", equals a vibration-free capture reducing camera shake which, in theory, equates to sharper images.  The gripping surfaces of the camera's body are tackey and impart a confidence of positive grip. The camera, handheld, never feels like it's going to slip--even with sweaty hands or in moist environments. In fact, this tackiness combined with the aforementioned deepened grip make the camera feel almost attached to the hand as if IT doesn't want to let go. Furthermore, the placement and enlargement of the DOF preview button is within perfect access to the ring finger; not once have I missed this button when I've needed it.  In reading several other reviews about this camera I've come across a few complaints about the rearrangement of some of its rear buttons. Although this rearrangement prevents total one-handed operation of the camera's most used functions, I personally see a method to Canon's madness......draw an imaginary line down and through the viewfinder and LCD......on the right half are all the primary buttons needed for image capture. On the left half are all the buttons for everything else. It really is that simple. Which, I believe, was Canon's direct intent: to distill down and simplify this rendition of its 5D moniker to the most purpose-driven and purpose built, no nonsensely refined and polished version to date.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "5d mkIII = Beauty", "Author": "Roland M.", "ReviewID": "R6PX34HJ5XXV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking to upgrade to something more professionaland have the cash to spend, get the 5d MKIII. best investmentfor photographers in 2012. Glad the camera was released in early 2012.The White Balance, Auto Focus, The Metering are improved tremendouslycompared to it's predecessor the 5d MKII.I own both cameras, MKII & MKIII,and what blew me away was how well you can capture an image in low lightconditions. In the previous version, MKII, setting your camera to ISO 6400,your image had tons of grain and was definitely not going to be one of your bestcaptures from the day. With the MKIII, ISO 6400 is compared to the MKII's ISO3200.This alone is worth the upgrade, but not the 1k price increase.The Metering & 61 point AF system is phenomenal. I'm sure you've read tons of reviewson the upgraded metering/AF system and similarities with the 7d, but this new systemblows away everything from the competition. The White Balance on this camera is beautiful. Exposureis accurate and have enjoyed shooting weddings, (photography only) in all sort of lighting conditions. 61 point vs 9 pointis a huge step up.

I have now moved to full frame and had been struggling on deciding Nikon D800e or Canon 5D MIII.  I have a friend with the Nikon so I got to play with it a bit.  Needless to say I like the product but like my 7D more when it came to speed and versatility.  On a leap of faith I decided to go with the 5D MIII as it seemed to be close to the 7D in operation.  I care about the best all around pictures also and sites like DXOMark really kept me holding out on the 5D MIII as the Nikon D800 and D800e rock the charts.  I want to say right not those charts are not everything.  I get great shots on the 5D mark III ( better then my 7D) and I liked the shots out of my 7D better than my friends Nikon D800e at the time I used it and even now based on what she takes.  I know some Nikon fans are going to flame what I just said but this was just based on my one time use of the D800e (which was not as comfortable for me to use).  I also did not sit down and do test with equivalent lenses.  My 7D has some really nice prime L glass I use and the Nikon had a zoom lens at the time.  I have seen some awesome shots come from that thing so I know it does the job but now when I see the Canon 5D (straight out of cam) shots it seems to appeal to me.  I usually shoot RAW so this is RAW not jpeg.  When I tested jpeg it seems Canon still has the old edge it had before with how the in cam software cleans up.It boils down to the 5D MIII being better then I expected and as versatile as my needs require.  I'm sure in time I would have been happy with the D800e but I can't say I would be as happy as I am now.I'm no a fan of any brand but I do like some things that each company does.  What I would give for a 5DMIII that has the resolution and dynamic range potential of a D800e or a D800e that has the great Software ISO enhancement and FPS of the 5DMIII.

I am not a pro; I'm a physician with a photography hobby.  My current shooters are a Nikon D700, a Canon 40D and a Canon 5D.  They are all fantastic cameras.  In just the several hours I've had it, shot with it - primarily with my 35-1.4 L and my 50-1.8 - it's great.  Given that I already have stock in both the Nikon and Canon camps, I could have easily gone with the D800 or D800E.  So in this (?initial?) posting, let me tell you what shaped my decision between the 5D Mark III and the D800.The Fred Miranda website did a direct comparison between the two and the D800 outperformed the 5D Mk III especially in the high contrast / dark area noise category.  The Ken Rockwell review put the 5D Mk III on top.  Site after site went back and forth, but the only review which gave pretty dramatic, objective material going against the Canon was the Fred Miranda review.

Most magazines have already deemed this \"camera of the year\" for 2012, yes even over the Nikon D800 (lets not get into a discussion about this, I did not write the review). What I wanted to mention is the ding ding wake up call. What do I mean?For all of you DSLR people pimping your cropped sensor ride (Canon 7D, etc) to get the most out of it to satisfy your mind that you are close to the full frame, WAKE UP and smell the coffee. Why? I talk from experience, because I was there. I started with the Canon Rebel (first digital), then to a Canon 50D, added quite a few extras, then went to the crop Canon flagship 7D with all the extras, cards, you name it. In my mind I was close to full frame, and was happy. Then I tried the Canon 5D Mark III. I shot, edited, viewed, and then the bubble popped. I found myself quickly realizing FULL FRAME is the name of the game. I will not go on any more, just saying, if you are a crop sensor and do \"some\" shooting, then your fine. If you are shooting, and are striving for the next level, then stop the mini upgrades, and slip into a 5D. You will wonder why all this time you drove on the bumpy road. Everyone who wants to comment on how fabulous their crop pictures are, I am sure they are all of that, what I am saying is there is an easier road to get there, plus more.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Your DSLR Camera search ends here", "Author": "Enrique", "ReviewID": "R2D1Y73FF7I1WY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am glad I bought this ibcredible camers.

That said, I came from a 40D and this thing is awesome in so many ways I can't even get into it, but here are the highlights:Fill frame and expanded ISO = WOW.  With my 40D I had trouble shooting at 1600 ISO, much less 3200 ISO, but with the 5D I have no issues letting it get into the 12,000 or even 25,000 ISO range because the images are so big post camera noise reduction is a breeze.  I use Lightroom and for the most part I can clean up a 25,600 ISO image without using Photoshop and Noiseware.  Very impressive.I can go manual and set my shutter and aperture and truly let the camera determine what the ISO should be (up to 25,600ISO I think).  This is a REALLY big deal coming from where I was where the 40D could only move between 100 and 400 ISO, and generally stayed firmly planted in the 400 ISO setting.  LOLThe camera working with my flash in manual mode works much better than the 40D.  I can't really explain this one other than taking shots in manual mode with flash on the 40D was always a challenge having to adjust ISO, shutter, and aperture to keep images from being over or underexposed.

It includes several samples from both the studio and the field (Death Valley, California and the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, Queens NY). It also includes several high ISO samples.The link can be found here:[...]From the conclusion:The Canon EOS 5d Mark III presents as an evolutionary model rather than an revolutionary one. It sounds like Canon was really listening to feedback from people like me who said to make the next camera more usable and not focus on additional resolution. If I look at the 5d Mark III in that vain, it is an unadulterated success. However, the 5d Mark III reminds me of how the Canon EOS 30d was an upgrade to the 20d. Like the 30d, the Canon EOS 5d Mark III provides a host of usability features that truly makes it a better camera than its predecessor while leaving the core engine essentially the same......Before I sound as if I am panning the 5d Mark III, let me clearly say that I definitely really like this camera. It does everything I need it to do - and more. I also suggest that it is odd that I am even mentioning the Nikon D800 in this review or rumors about the vaporware EOS 3D. I have never mentioned a competitive product while doing a review before, attempting to judge a product in its own right. It is just that the D800 is such a huge entry into the market that it colors pretty much everything as a result - and that is pretty wild if you think about it. The end result is that I find myself ambivalent about a camera that I really like as a tool. That is - I hope you agree - somewhat irrational. My guess is that my feelings mirror many of the same themes that have been raised in the different gear head forums. The trick is distinguishing what are legitimate gripes versus more existential issues. So, I own the 5d Mark III and choose to get rid of the existential angst. It is a great camera - even though I think it might be priced a bit higher than it should.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "good deal", "Author": "Jacob", "ReviewID": "R1FN80QUCWM2NE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The shipping is quick.

I have two reasons:1) Low light focus, you get full frame, better focus (even though the low light is not that great - I tried at ISO 25600, the focus went crazy. I can't get it focused at all). Comparing my old 5d mark ii, it is no better. It is only better when the light is good and the object being shot is moving then Mark iii performs better). My 1d Mark IV is actually quicker in focusing though at 16 meg pixel. True, the IOS quality has been raised from 6400 to 12800 low light wise between 1d mark iv and 5d mark iii. You still need a flash to have a good picture at ISO 12800 for 5d Mark III. The occasion of shooting at this low light is not that common, say maybe 10-20% of your overall shooting. I see improvement but not big enough to buy Mark iii instead of Mark II. Buying a used 1D Mark IV can be a better idea if you are talking about low light shooting and auto focus.2) Cost - 7d is less than 2k, new 1d mark IV is 4.5K, Nikon d800 is 3k (with flash, better low light, faster focus). After looked at the features and the images taken, I am not sold on 5d Mark III. It is good but not good enough to be $500 than D800, $1.75k more than 7d. The full frame is fine but unless you develop pictures that big, 1.3x or 1.6x offered by 1d mark iv and 7d are enough for you if we talk about the picture quality only.Pros - more focus points, 3.2 view finder, better video, better weather protectionCons - not worth the 1k premium over 5d mark II or 1.75k over 7d, low light focus in need of improvement, not features competitive with Nikon d800I returned mine and decide to keep my 1d mark iv and wait for the next upgrade opportunity.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving my new camera!", "Author": "karebear", "ReviewID": "R2YCFCUQZT3FIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only used it a couple of times and I'm still getting adjusted to the differences between it and the mark ii, but so for I'm loving it.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Camera", "Author": "steve thommen", "ReviewID": "R3G1ZQ73K68UP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exceptional camera for a true professional that delivers the highest quality pictures every time you use it.

Wlin", "ReviewID": "RYEOU0ZAIIJ0C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I like to state that I am not a professional photographer and my company manufactures professional aerial video octocopters. I will be reviewing mostly the video part. See the aerial footage of Palatine Hill and Colosseum I filmed by search \"Turbo Ace X88\" in Youtube. We use exclusively Canon for aerial video and my review would tell you how we have reached such a decision after months and months of research and comparisons. Go to TurboAce.com and checkout what a Mark III can do in the air and why cinematographers are using it.The Mark III has the most stable under vibration and the it has the least moire issue among all the DSLR cameras we have tested. The cameras tested were Nikon D800, D3100, D5100, D90, D7000, Canon Mark ii, T3i, T4i. Our company spends thousands of dollars testing camera equipment that are suited for aerial, so the above cameras actually went up the air during these experiments. The Mark III has the tiny bit of moire issue as a 60,000 Sony film camera and I am very impressed. If you are familiar with moire, paid attention to any of the multi-million dollar productions and it is there, a pain for the directors and producer. I recommend only this DSLR for video especially aerial. At the time of the final test, the final contenders were the D800 and the Mark II/III, so which one is better?1. More mega pixel, more noise. Nikon just shot itself on the foot getting into the mega pixel race which Canon used to play. The D800 has noticeable noise level than the Mark iii when compared at 12k or higher ISO. I shot photos of green leaves on an indoor plant when I did the side by side comparison.2. For stills, auto white balance under fluorescent lighting shows a greenish tone on the D800 which looks very unatural. Even after I played with it by adjusting the kelvin, I could not make it better than the Mark iii image taken under the same condition with Auto white balance.3. Moire on video for the Mark iii is better than the Mark ii and the D800. Compare the videos side by side, you will notice the big difference.4. For stills, D800 shows more detail outdoor, or indoor with tons of light. I would buy the D800 if I need the mega pixel badly but it has no use for me other than chewing up my memory and slowing down the frame rate. The D800 has to wait for 2 minutes for the buffer to clear after shooting about 15 continuous frames. The Mark iii kept on going but at a much slower rate. At least the Mark iii was still usable while the Nikon was not responding at all.5. For stills, focus on the Mark iii is faster than D800. The D800 does hesitate a bit whereas the Mark iii was push and click, yes it's scary fast.6. Canon video has more accurate white balance and this carries on to the Mark iii. If you do video, Mark iii is a no brainer. The video was also a lot sharper than my Canon M52 which incorporates the 1/3 inch sensor the big camcorder uses. Again a no brainer if you are a cinematographer.7. Update: The following point is no longer true as the D800 supplies has improved, thumbs up for Nikon finally able to increase the supply to deliver the true MSRP. Price of D800 is not $2995. The lowest price in stock is on Ebay is $3650. Price is coming down fast at about $20 per day and I have been tracking this on Ebay. Good luck finding a D800 in stock because it does not exist unless you buy it on Craigslist or Ebay. Don't waste your time, wait for another month it should be better. Order cancellation on the D800 is going to surprise Nikon, they are taking too long to deliver and people are starting to find out that Canon is better this time. Most people are using the camera for sports, family, wedding and not landscape and the Mark iii is better for those applications.We switched to Canon because of our need but your need may be different. If you are a landscape photographer or wants to blow up your photo extremely large with more mega pixels and you have plenty of lights, stick with Nikon. If you are a cinematographer, sports, wedding or simply indoor family photographer go with the Mark iii. Canon is not always going to be better than Nikon and Nikon isn't always going to be better than Canon. But I can honestly tell you, for now this year Canon has stepped up and broken the ISO barrier and its video has blown Nikon out of the water. It has caught up with Nikon's low noise technology after 2 complete product cycles. What took Canon so long, I have no idea.I highly recommend the Mark III if you are going with the video or still, except if you are a landscape photographer or work under studio light.

(5 stars).* If you mainly shoot landscape or still subjects *and* are starting a FF system, I'd strongly suggest checking out Nikon D800. It's $500 cheaper and has better IQ (4 stars).* If you're a hobbyist getting into FF *and* don't need 1DX-class AF, I'd strongly recommend 5dMkII. It's $1400 cheaper with nearly identical IQ in raw images (3 stars).* If you already own 5dMkII, don't shoot much action and other MkIII features don't interest you (silent shutter, better build, brighter viewfinder etc), wait until the next generation or a sizable price drop. As is, too pricey (3 stars).I pre-ordered MkIII when the camera was announced, after seeing Canon's claims that the IQ was improved about 2 stops compared to 5dMkII. Having spent a few days with it, I can say that 5dMkIII is a great camera. The body feels more solid than its predecessor. The new 7D-style viewfinder is brighter. The new AF works wonderfully especially in low light and with the outer focus points. However, I don't see the 2-stop IQ improvement in raw images using Lightroom. At best, the IQ has been improved marginally. Only in-camera JPGs show substantial improvement, which I don't use.As is, the camera's biggest selling point is AF. I don't think the upgrade from 5dMkII is worth it unless you frequently photograph moving subjects or need 1DX-class AF. Why 3 stars? First off, 5dMkII has pretty similar IQ to 5dMkIII in raw images. However it has an outdated AF unit (a poor design choice by Canon), which is not an obstacle for most people including myself. Second, Nikon D800 sells for $500 less, and it offers as much as MkIII does if not more. Given the more reasonably priced alternatives, and the incremental IQ improvement from much-cheaper 5dMkII, I can only rate this one 3 stars (for people in my position). As a hobbyist who doesn't shoot much action, I think I'll keep my MkII and send this one back.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "Julie Guerrero \"grandmajag\"", "ReviewID": "R1H123NU9DGS8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A semi professional dream camera.

'feces' should I go with Canon again?\" The answer came as a \"no\" followed by a \"but.\" You see, although I am not a professional photographer, I did manage to get suckered into purchasing a bunch of really expensive Canon lenses over the years. SO as much as I would have loved to switch to Nikon, buying a new set of high-end lenses would prove to be prohibitive.  My musings were interrupted by another notice of \"Error99\" by my Canon40D, indicating that either I buy a new camera, or I should be prepared to shell out another ~250-300 for repair of the old one. And, given my investment in Canon lenses, it will have to be another Canon. With heavy heart, I searched the internet for a new camera, reading the reviews of available Canon products, and finally settled on Canon EOS 5D Mark III.  The  camera arrived 10 days ago and I am glad to report that, despite my dismal experience with its 40D predecessor, \"5D MarkIII\" appears to be an almost different (and better) animal. Here is my, amateur take on it. So far.PROs:  -- shooting at mind-bogglingly high ISOs does make need for a flash so last-century  -- crisp-edge images  -- sturdy body  -- more intuitive interface  -- marginal changes of buttons and dials compared to prior versions of Canon SLRs, making  conversion from my old 40D to this new beastie a breeze.CONs:  -- the prices is an absolute downer! Judging by the impressions I got from reading numerous posts on countless forums and blogs (and my own feelings about this new purchase) I'd rather have NO video capability (which, in this model, lacks an intuitive dynamic AutoFocus and, therefore, seriously limits the use of this feature), NO dual card use (in Mark III one can use two different media cards, but um... so what?...), and FEWER other cosmetic bells and whistles if it meant ~$1000 less for the camera.

Now this has been addressed in Mark III. Great usability improvements in control panel including live view. 6FPS is awesome to have. Video quality is just amazing. Having two cards is very nice as well. High ISO quality  - it is a noticeable improvement over Mark II and 60D, even though they also have an excellent rating in this space. There are many other improvements over Mark II everywhere - you can probably read about on any comparison site - I will not be going into those here. I never used or cared about having an embedded flash in professional camera of this type - if I need to use flash, I use my Canon 430EXII which gives me great results which no embedded flash would ever give. Embedded flash is more of a point-and-shoot camera type feature. I like having HDR feature as it allows me to easily get 3 raw images plus HDR jpg. I do not use resulting jpg, I shoot in RAW all the time anyway, but I post-process those files in Photoshop later for final HDR image.

However, I find  5d III  more suitable to my needs, Im not a professional but I like to shoot and  tag along with friends who are professionals. 5d iii is really comfortable to hold, its kinda heavy but it helps you hold it more stable, 22 MP  is way more than enough specially i shoot RAW,  the details were really good .  What makes this camera best is its AF,  It has different settings to a specific activity and its really accurate even at low lights. I don't knowwhat DXO is talking about but real life testing 5diii blows out d800 in low light settings, yup D800 kept more details at lower iso but beyond ISO 400+ with 5d III owns.  Moving on , 5d III white balance is quite well and  and 6FPS is not much but good enough. So far I think this is the best all around DSLR.  And, when Nikon introduced d600 i was blown away with the specs to  price ratio =) and how well it did as a friend showed me his new gadget, However Its not better than 5d III (  justify 1.5k  lol ) except for dynamic range but it regresses at higher ISO  . d600 is the best bang for the bucks out there and enough reason to switch if you haven't invested in lenses yet and with a tighter budget.  6d is not even worth mentioning =) they should have put full frame sensor on 7d specs and thats a killer.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon 5D Mark III Camera", "Author": "Mike M. \"Mike M.\"", "ReviewID": "R3NTPXQS8NGVUO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As expected, the Canon 5D, Mark III is an excellent camera.

You need to know how to properly use it, else you will end up like many of the people griping about the camera.

Newer generations can't take the time to learn their cameras. However, if you do take the time to learn it, and really study DSLR filmmaking, you are sure to make great videos. And no, you don't need an XLR input on a DSLR. There are many reasons why Canon did not include those types of audio connections on the upgraded 5D Mark III, and I won't get into that here. There are plenty of alternatives including external audio (like the real pros do it) or adapter boxes like the one from Juicedlink.All in all, this camera is a great step above the 5D Mark II and I highly recommend it...

The camera worked flawlessly Friday night with about 600 photos taken at 1 minute exposures, ISO 1000, with very little noise using the Canon AC power supply and the remote timer. Night photography is the reason I purchased the camera-I do mostly night photography. Saturday night I set up the camera like Friday, started taking photos, left the timer running and went to bed. At 0200 I went out to check on the camera. The shutter was running non-stop at about a 1 sec intervals, not saving photos so I turned the power switch off to no avail. I removed the power supply and the camera stopped of course as it had no power. I put in a fresh battery and it started cycling again. I removed the battery and went back to bed. 0600 I placed a fresh battery in the camera and it again started cycling. I took videos and photos of the camera in case Canon wanted to use them to diagnose the problem. I then removed the time/date battery and the camera battery, let the camera sit for an hour, replaced the batteries, and the camera now functioned normally. I did not try taking any more night multiple exposures. Due to this malfunction I missed photographing one of the best meteor showers in years, the camera fried a compact flash card, and I spent over $500 in gas.I phoned Canon on Monday and was told they would repair or replace the camera at their option. I told them I would send the camera to Canon with all of the data only if they replaced the camera. They refused. So I am returning the camera to the vendor and they will give me a replacement with no hassle.I am severely disappointed in Canon's response.

Short answer - no. It's the little bits and pieces that simply cannot stand up to extended use. The two big issues that everybody is talking about are the joystick and the mode dial. The cover to my mode dial fell off after light use (no drop, no water damage, just regular use). The cover is a thin piece of metal that has the modes on it (Av, Tv, M, etc.). It is not essential for the camera to function but without it it is difficult to tell which mode you are in. When I sent my camera into Canon I was expecting the cost of repair to reflect the nature of the piece that fell off. When I got word from Canon that it would cost $250 to have the cover replaced, I was shocked. When I expressed my disappointment to them, they began negotiating the price and eventually told me they could do it for around $200 so I told them to send the camera back unrepaired.Several of my friends and colleagues have also had their mode dial covers fall off so this is evidently a common issue. None of them have been willing to pay the cost of repair and have decided to simply tape a piece of paper to the mode dial so they can know which mode is which. It is a shame that customers who spent over $3,000 on their cameras must take this route, lest they spend hundreds of dollars on a little metal cap.I have found that the build quality has drastically decreased from the Mark II to the Mark III.

I'd read so much about it before decided to return it, almost everyone is saying no affect on image quality, but common sense tells me light leaking is light leaking, it's a big deal in photography equipment, of course shooting in 1/1000 and 1/900 makes no difference in image quality in normal situation, but I can't accept a $3.5k camera has this big design flaw, I know canon offers a fix free of charge, but experience tells me that sending a camera to repair shop or service center will only introduce dust to the camera. I'm sure a lot of canon fan boys will disagree, I'm myself a big canon fan, and that's the reason I'm sending it back.BTW, I'll buy another 5D3 when the \"xxxxx3xxxxxx\" serial comes out.

This is a fantastic piece of photographic engineering and anyone who has one in his hands has only himself to blame if he isn't able to create amazing images. But, as it stands, the D800 did steal the Canon's thunder quite a bit. If I had to judge (purely on specs, reviews, and samples for the D800, as I haven't been able to get my hands on one), I'd have to give the win to the Nikon. If you haven't invested in glass, and just want the best value for money full format, the Nikon probably has it by a nose (photo finish - pun intended). However, this camera is superior in low light performance, speed, and video.If you NEED one to two stops better high iso performance and the 6fps performance gotta go with the Canon. If you NEED the highest resolution and dynamic range, because you plan to make a living making poster size prints and billboards, the Nikon wins handily. Most people would probably get more actual use out of the high iso performance. But the image quality on the D800! From what I've seen, at 100% magnification, the D800 is noticeably superior. When it comes down to it, even if you aren't going to notice the difference in an 8x10 print, you'd KNOW deep down that the D800 had the best IQ if you ever needed to make a billboard out of it. But on the Mark III, you'll get more usable prints in low light, or just catch more moments with the more fps.My wife bought this camera for herself and has been agonizing whether to jump ship to Nikon. In the end, she decided to stay with Canon. The real life advantages of the Canon versus the slightly superior image quality of the Nikon. Not an easy decision, but not one you can really screw up.Congratulations to anyone who ends up with either of these fantastic cameras.

My first thousand or so shots were at a wedding a couple days after I got it in the mail. I also picked up a Canon Flash.... 430EX I believe? It's the first flash other than the built-in flash on other cameras so my experience is severely limited. Regardless, I got some great shots with this hefty beast. And by hefty, I mean you could bludgeon a man to death with this thing and take pictures of his corpse afterward and still get flawless shots.The other night I went out and drove around the strip (I live in Las Vegas) and took some shots from my window. I've done this with my 7D on occasion to test out night-shooting. Low-light shooting is amazing. Granted, it's not perfect and you're much better off if you can shoot from a steady position. None of my previous DSLRs provided me with the capability of shooting in some of the conditions I've attempted with the results that the 5DM3 is capable of. At 12,800 ISO, I cannot believe how clean the shots are. I've seen lower quality from 800 ISO shots from other cameras.Having owned the 7D for some time, I knew I was upgrading, but had no idea it would be this much of an upgrade.

Testing the 5d3 out left me scratching my head as the images were very close to my 5DII. Claims about 1.5 stops of better high ISO control are a bit off the mark as there also seems to be more aggressive noise reduction. For most shooters I doubt they'll find a big difference in their prints.BUT....and this is the real news: Canon has finally designed a auto focus system that works well. Nothing else in the 5DIII is a significant upgrade, but the AF most certainly is. The 5DIII is finally competing with Nikon for AF!So, if you love your 5DII and found the AF good enough, the 5DIII is a mediocre upgrade. But if you require a professional auto focus module in your DSLR, then this is the way to go.For myself....I ordered the Nikon D800. It tops the 5DIII in every respect, including noise and dynamic range. It's slower at 4 FPS, but that never seemed to bother me with the 5DII. The D800 can also shoot at 6 FPS in DX mode and still give 15 MP worth of detail.OR...now maybe a great time to snag a 5DII at a great price as the 5DIII is quite frankly an insult at the current asking price of $3500.00.

I use to shoot Canon during the film days. I tested both the Canon 5D mkIII and the Nikon D800 and here are my results. I tested a 5DmkIII with a 24-70 f2.8 lens and a Nikon D800 (not D800e) with a 24-70 f2.8 lens.High ISO:About the same, except D800 has a lot more detail to work with. In Lightroom, I can save a higher percentage of ISO 6400 shots because the D800 has more detail. Canon seems cleaner initially in Lightroom but when the picture fits into a 24\" 1920x1080 monitor or a 64\" Samsung plasma TV, the Nikon looks a tad cleaner, noise less noticeable. I think the Canon looks cleaner in Lightroom because it is just a smaller picture. But displaying ISO 6400 shots on a monitor or TV, Nikon looks nicer in general. Both cameras at ISO 12,800 look awful and not recoverable in Lightroom. It might look acceptable as a really small pic but why the heck would you buy an expensive camera to display really small crappy looking pictures?Frames per second:Easy winner. Canon can shoot 6 FPS, Nikon 4 FPS. However, in practice I think 4 FPS is pretty good. None of these cameras are really Olympic style sports cameras.Resolution:Easy winner. Nikon's RAW files are more detailed, almost 3D like. I can't really explain it other than the pictures look more real. I can crop a photo to 1/3 it's size (12 megapixels) and it still looks stunning. I wonder how much better the D800e version is. I'll have to wait until my friend receives his to find out.JPEG:Easy winner. Out of the camera, the Canon JPEGs are phenomenal. The processing done is quite remarkable.RAW:Easy winner. If you shoot RAW, Nikon is it. Also there is an issue with the Canon with the color red. I think the color is overblown at times because all the details are loss and not recoverable in Lightroom. Not always but it has happened at least twice. The same photo on the Nikon kept all the details.Autofocus:About the same. Canon and Nikon have awesomely quick autofocus and I couldn't determine a difference. The only caveat is that Nikon focuses better in lowlight (without the autofocus assist lamp) and also the Nikon focuses when there is almost no light (with the autofocus assist lamp). Why the heck doesn't Canon include an autofocus assist lamp is beyond me. Also, Nikon's face detection is extremely useful because it focuses right on the eyeballs.Flash:Easy winner. Canon doesn't have built in flash. Nikon flash worked surprisingly well.Dynamic Range:Easy winner. Nikon knocked it out of the park. I got a lot less blown highlights with shots with white clothing and more realistic blue skys. Also, there is a lot more headroom on both the highlights and shadows on the Nikon when editing in Lightroom. How did Nikon have better shadows and highlights! They have to share some of that technology!Video:Suprisingly about the same. I would have thought that Canon's lead in video would maintain. Surprisingly, the Nikon's video was just as awesome as the Canon. Nikon's video has a bit more detail and is definitely a little sharper than the Canon. I didn't test Nikon's uncompressed HDMI out, although it seems to be a useful feature (this is like RAW HDMI output for video). Canon should adopt uncompressed HDMI out also.Price:Easy winner. Why anyone (who doesn't already have Nikon or Canon lenses) would buy this Canon for $500 more than the Nikon would need to think twice. I can see why the Nikon is selling so much better than the Canon, at least on Amazon.Comfort:Both about the same weight. Both feel nice in the hand. Canon possibly slightly more comfortable if you have bigger hands. Nikon maybe more comfortable with smaller hands. Both are fine though.USB transfer:Nikon wins with USB 3.0. Skipping the card reader altogether by just plugging in the camera to the computer is convenient. Also the transfer speed is much much faster than Canon's older USB 2.0. This saves a lot of time.LCD Screen:Canon has slightly better screen in direct sunlight (LCD facing up towards the sun). Nikon is better when the LCD is not directly facing the sun. Nikon's screen is crisper and more 3D like.Weatherproofing:My last day of shooting was in a light mist/drizzle. I was shooting both cameras again for about 20 minutes when the Canon 5D mkIII developed some fogging inside the viewfinder screen. I could not wipe it away as it seemed to be inside the camera. I could no longer take pictures normally without live view. Nikon didn't have this problem and I continued to shoot the rest of the day with the Nikon in the same wet conditions without issue. I had planned to shoot at least 2 weeks with both cameras so this was definitely a bummer.Lenses:Both Canon and Nikon's 24-70 2.8 lenses are great. I would say the Canon 24-70 2.8 is just a tad faster on focus. Nikon is slightly sharper in the corners. Both Nikon and Canon seem to have a very comparable lens assortment (although my wallet won't be happy buying so many new lenses!)Well, after using both cameras for about a week, I kept the Nikon D800 and returned my (possibly water damaged) Canon 5D mkIII. Both are phenomenal cameras but D800 has definitely outclassed the 5D mkIII in this round. Maybe Canon will come back strong with its next version. It definitely has some catching up to do.Thanks for reading my review and I'll also post this on the Nikon D800 review page.

So I am giving it 5 stars just for that.Update *** After just a few days of shooting.I will not review technical or specifications on the camera because those numbers can be read in every single photography website there is. I rather talk about my transition from the t3i to the 5d mark 3.Coming from a canon t3i this is a big step up.This camera feels much heavier than my t3i to the point that when I go back to the t3i, it feels more like a very expensive toy.I always thought that I could get around the full frame factor by taking 3 steps back and shoot but no. There is something I still can't understand about it but it's no just about how much light the sensor will digest. There is something in the composition that just work better. I shot 2 music videos with my t3i and having this much room for low light situations is a MUST. Just when you thought you had a good shot from the cropped sensor camera and you go to editing then you look how bad the dark areas look if you blow up the picture to fill the entire computer screen. NOT ANYMORE with the 5dm3. This is a very clean picture and the small amount of noise in low light actually looks good....a tiny bit like film grain.It's funny how a simple thing like a headphone output can make a huge impact in videos. Even when the t3i can monitor audio level I was still getting some unwanted sounds that I had to correct in final cut or pro tools. But now that I have the headphone mix I can propperly adjust the gain and capture a better signal from my shot gun mic.If you have an entree level Dslr like a t2i or t3i and you're still questioning if this upgrade is worth it? Well it is. I started  getting paid for my photography and videos and I wish I had the 5dm3 for my last 2 sessions. I'm pretty sure my cllients will appreciate the outpu of this wonderfull instrument.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just another expensive camera (but worth it for a pro).", "Author": "Marc B.

I actually lost my first one when I was trying to get really low to the ground and slipped. The camera fell into the mud, and the lens which wasn't fully attached fell off and filled with mud.Luckily, it was right before Christmas so my parents got me a new one. :-POverall, very good camera, but it'd be nice if it had some features that allowed a bit of creativity, like faces and props that can be superimposed onto the pictures. I also would prefer that it had Twitter integration. These minor grievances combined with the fact that some of my pictures seem a bit blurry sometimes are what make this a four-star camera.

I have used Canon gear years ago and think that they are a great company and makes great gear.  I was considering getting the Mark III over the D800 but wanted the chance to use the camera before buying.The body of the Mark III is well built however it did feel too much like plastic for my taste.  The buttons were well placed and easy to use.  Image quality was amazing and I was not disapointed!One thing I will point out is that I did notice the LCD light leak problem!  I have also heard that Canon is considering recalling this camera due to this huge issue.  To me, spending $3500 on a camera and having this kind of issue that has to be sent back to Canon to fix is a problem!  This is the reason for 2 stars.  I don't think it would be so bad if it could be fixed by firmware update, however this is a hardware problem.  Other than this, it's a great camera and I may still get one once Canon fixes their light leak problem.  I just think it's something people should be aware of.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "GOD CAMERA but......", "Author": "Star", "ReviewID": "R3CZYTBSWFN7QO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If real serious about it go for the 60-D 18-200.

I always look towards getting the shot done mostly in camera and really don't want to invest more time into toying with pictures in editing.
