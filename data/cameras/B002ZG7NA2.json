If I ever just want to take some pictures without setting everything up, the pictures come out terrible. A large part of the problem is the white balance. Everything comes out extremely cool. I am now attempting to sell it even though I have only had the camera for about a month.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera by fujifilm", "Author": "Old King Cole", "ReviewID": "R35J032OE9L2LE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always purchased fujifilm cameras in the past and been very satified with all of them. The F72 EXR is no exception to this statement. The camera works very well and is easy to use. It has a variety of great features that are easy to understand such as the different \"modes\" you can select for taking pictures such as \"party\" or \"landscape\". I also like the black color as it adds a touch of class to the camera. Great camera overall.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best pocket camera at this price", "Author": "JJ \"DIY\"", "ReviewID": "R1DVMYN4VUE8JO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this refurbished F72EXR online 3 weeks ago. After playing it for 2 weeks and learning some tips online to use it, I'm very satisfied with this camera. It's an excellent pocket camera but it's also complicated to use. You have to follow the expert's suggestion on the settings to get the best out of it. It could be the best pocket camera for the price that I paid. So far, I have owned 6~7 pockets cameras and this one is the best.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Underated", "Author": "Balto", "ReviewID": "R2ADE7N48T50NS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes excellent pictures, but is not a do it all point and shoot take mediocre~bad pictures in any situation camera.The other reviews state that the colors are lacking and the temp is cool, well let me tell you this. this camera takes  accurate color pictures, not oversatured like most point and shoot cameras today. Want to unrealistic saturated colors? use photoshop, its easier to saturate than to desaturate trying to get accurate color reproduction.The low light pictures this camera take are above average even for today standards, you just need to know how to set it appropriately. Just google \"How to shoot an EXR\" and you will find how to shoot this camera effectively.The lens quality is excellent, it does have some effect but it is minimal and less than mostly any camera in this category.Aluminum body construction is great and makes the camera feel sturdy, the construction just feels premium compared to plastic body cameras.If you want a camera that just require \"point and shoot\" to take mediocre to bad pictures this camera ain't for you. This camera is capable of taking great pictures you just have to do your part and learn how to shoot it.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor indoor Camera", "Author": "L.
