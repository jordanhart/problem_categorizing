{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent choice for a budget digital camera, has date stamp", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R3CQ7L1UK2EE3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my white S3 at Costco for under 100 dollars, and the Costco bundle came with a very nice case and a Transcend 2GB SD memory card.  The S3's own box included a LiIon battery pack, a one-piece battery charger (no cord needed), a hand strap, a USB cable, and the software CD-ROM.The S3 weighs 4 oz. with battery and card and is what we used to call an idiot-proof camera. It has only 4 shooting modes: Panasonic's famous iA (intelligent auto) mode, which is simply the best automatic scene-dependent shooting mode on the compact digital camera market today, a normal mode that is similar to the program mode on other digital cameras, a scene mode that lets you pick from 16 presets (including high sensitivity, sports, portrait, baby, etc.), and a camcorder mode that shoots video in Quicktime format at 1280x720, 640x480 (VGA) or 320x240 (QVGA) resolutions. BTW, unlike more expensive Panasonic cameras, the S3 cannot zoom while shooting video, a pity.The S3 comes in several colors; mine is white and looks very stylish.  It feels good and light in the hand, although I also think it feels almost like a toy, but not in a bad way.  The plastic casing seems durable (and fingerprint-friendly), and the buttons are all solid and easy to press.Unlike other digicams in this price range or even more expensive, the S3 exhibits little shutter lag, that is, as soon as you press the shutter button, it takes the picture (unless it's really dark in the room). The S3 takes excellent outdoor pictures, with excellent color accuracy and contrast and good focus.  Indoors, most of the no-flash pictures I have taken of my kids look good, but understandably the digital noise is higher.  Indoor flash photography is not something I'd call good on any compact digital camera, including this one, although the flash does make a good fill-in flash outdoors when the subject's face has shadows.Overall, I find the S3 *very* pleasant to use.  Its good performance in shutter lag and excellent outdoor picture quality and good indoor quality make it a winner for a low-cost, no-brainer take-it-anywhere camera. It even comes with date stamp (with or without time), something many casual photographers love.Note: I posted a sample video and some sample images on the black Panasonic Lumix DMC-S3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black) product page.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent value-packed easy-to-use camera that is great for a novice first-timer.", "Author": "\u0083\u016f\u008e\u017a\u0178 \u03c9\u016c", "ReviewID": "R3EYOMZ6GG28WD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": null, "Date": "July 31, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "MEGA OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) - Helps reduce blurry photos due to hand-shake\nFace Detection - Helps to ensures registered faces are captured in focus with appropriate exposure and unwanted red eyes are digitally corrected\nSelects the best option from Macro, Portrait, Scenery, Night Portrait, Night Scenery and Sunset by detecting the environment\nIntelligent ISO Control - Detects the speed of the subject's movement and determines the right combination of ISO sensitivity\nAlso it controls shutter speed to help prevent motion blur\nIntelligent Scene Selector -\nSelects the best option from Macro, Portrait, Scenery, Night Portrait, Night Scenery and Sunset by detecting the environment\nShutter speed to help prevent motion blur", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-S3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GrUMzqOvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004O6RQSA"}}
