We have a few weeks left before she gets here but we've tried it out a few times and LOVE IT! I was really excited about this purchase because it came with everything we needed as far as a case, memory card, and battery - all of which could have increased out purchase price significantly elsewhere.  Our package was shipped and delivered in just a few days of ordering, which was very nice. If I ever need a new camera I know where I am going to purchase it and from whom BeachCamera.com!", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing product!

I had researched different cameras. I wanted a bridge camera and this one had great reviews and for good reason. It takes great pictures in auto or manual mode. For a professional I'm sure this is less than expected but beign an amateur who just want to take great pictures, this is great. I also bought a tripod seperately and it attaches just fine to it. Everything that came in the bundle was in great packaging and just what you need.  Love this camera!", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price", "Author": "Alan E.

It works well for most applications but the ability to use it for close up shots is non existent.

Packaged well, everything arrived in perfect condition. I decided to buy this camera from the reviews I had read by many previous purchasers, versus other models, prices and capabilities. This camera is even better then I thought it would be. Takes excellent photos in auto mode, yet has so many various features that it will probably take me months to figure them all out even with the user manual that comes with the cameras software CD. The accessary package is surprising as well, with Camera Bag, 16GB memory card, USB adapter, rechargeable batteries and charger, lens cleaner and oh yeah...one thing that I (we) found funny, actually comical, is the \"tripod\" that comes with the package, albeit, functional, it's smaller then the camera, I'll keep it around just for laughs if nothing else. Five stars still goes to this dealer, for service and product. If I were to add anything to be fair, I've only had this camera for about 2 weeks now and really haven't found anything that I didn't like about it. (Saw some reviews that mentioned problems with the lens cap being loose, no such problem with mine, it fits snug). Note too, for more technical information about the camera, it would probably be better to rely on other reviews. In short, I'm very pleased, should anything change about that I will post it accordingly in an updated review.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera and accessories!", "Author": "Charity Clark", "ReviewID": "R1LST8ODR1PGLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm just going to do a pros and cons list.Pros-Good colorPanorama modeAccessory kitCons-Not rechargeable battery packTripod isn't what I expected but my grandfather gave me oneCame with 16GB SD cardOver all it's an amazing camera.

Prinz", "ReviewID": "R2GEBFB2XNMA3T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a novice photographer and really need a point and shoot camera.  I decided to go with this camera because it had the high zoom, and the white one is so cool looking.  The camera seems to take decent pictures, but...It is an odd bulky shape, not something you can just throw in your pocket.  The lens cap is an issue, it doesn't stay on very well, and if you attach it to the camera with the strap, it sometimes falls in front of the lens, blocking the pictures.  The manual for the camera is on a computer disk, and it would be much easier to read and understand if there was a printed book.  I think the directions are not easy to understand.  The camera has a lot of great options, I just can't figure out how to use them.  Also, many times the picture does not look good on the camera screen, but looks fine once it is downloaded?  I also forget to turn the flash on, as you have to open the flash manually each time you turn the camera on.  I have tried to take outside night time pictures twice, and they don't turn out at all, just black.  I have already told my husband I want a new point and shoot for Christmas, either the newest Kodak model or the sony cybershot.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0050JLQRC"}}
