{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice Improvement Over the K10D Deserves More Credit", "Author": "P. VANDALEN", "ReviewID": "R3446N3CJ09ZCJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If Pentax were a bit more serious about increasing the sales of their cameras to first-time Pentax buyers, they'd be making some changes to their marketing strategy.  It's unfortunate that with most consumer/professional camera reviews, the Pentax products get dinged in relation to their competitors when they shouldn't have to be.  You can see this in the Consumer Reports review of DSLRs and other reviews such as PopPhoto.  The problem is that these reviews are performed with tested cameras at their default settings, and Pentax chooses to \"compromise\" the performance of their cameras by requiring custom adjustments to bring about the true potential of the product.  The K10D took a hit with its lower-contrast, soft and dark pictures when in default mode.  Change the settings and you have a camera every bit in step with its competition at the time.  Now the K20D suffers the same fate with the decision to make Noise Reduction-OFF the default setting.  The PopPhoto test of the K20D actually resulted in higher noise levels than the K10D.  Indeed, when I first compared the two cameras, I found them both the same at ISO 1600 for the amount of visible noise.  Obviously, this is a shocker when you consider that the K20 uses the new CMOS sensor as opposed to the K10's CCD.  Although the detail was higher in the K20, the noise was no better.  That is, until I set noise reduction to \"weak.\"  What a difference!  Comparing shots taken at the same settings between the two cameras (K10 default has noise reduction on) but with the K20 at the full 14.6 mp setting and highest JPEG quality with noise reduction at \"weak,\" and the K20's image is strikingly cleaner and sharper.  There's no doubt the resolution of the K20's image is hands-down superior to the K10.  But you won't read about this in any review unless they choose to turn on noise reduction.  There is a very slight loss of detail with NR on, but the resolution of the K20's sensor is so good anyway that the loss is negligible (especially with the Pentax DA* 50-135 lens).  Certainly experienced photographers could argue the Pentax reasoning behind the default setting issue, but from a marketing perspective, subjective reviews and objective lab results based on lesser picture performance of default settings can only hurt potential sales when a buyer sees that the 40D or the D300 has clearly better performance in the noise level competition.  When you're going up against the giants, you need to exploit the maximum potential of your product, and I believe Pentax has failed to do that.Having a K10 and a number of Pentax lenses already, I couldn't quite justify jumping ship for the excellent Canon 40D or Nikon D300.  But in the end, the price of the K20 was well-justified.  The first feature that sold me on the camera is one that only true professional cameras have and isn't even mentioned in the K20 pitch - the ability to fine-tune the auto focus system so that if a lens is front or back-focusing, you can correct for it.  This allows you to change the relationship between the point you focus on to the front-to-back area around that object that is also in focus known as the depth of field.  This feature could save you a lot of heartache with poorly calibrated lenses that would otherwise be useless.  The second feature of this camera that sold me is the improved sensor with its 14.6 MP rating and increased resolution.  ISO 1600 shots are now a non-issue compared to the K10.  Overall, the K20's pictures tend to be a tad bit warmer than the K10's, but I've also found them to better handle high-contrast transitions between bright and dark with less blown-out bright areas.  This was evident in sunset shots where the brightest areas of the orange clouds went yellow in the K10 but kept their detail and color with the K20 (shooting in JPEG).  No longer is there an issue with under-exposed shots as with the K10, and normal settings are set close to sharpness/contrast ideals, I've found.  But of course, it's all adjustable to just about any result you could want.  Just be prepared to deal with some pretty big file sizes on the highest quality JPEG setting - about 11MB.  Shoot in RAW and it's almost twice that size.  4GB SD cards suddenly seem puny.After several thousand shots with the K20, there are a few things that I would consider a bit of a deficit with this camera's performance.  First and foremost is the burst rate of 3 frames per second.  This is perfectly fine for just about all shooting situations except sports.  If you plan to do sports photography, this is not the camera for you.  Way too much action happens between frames at that slow rate.  The other area where performance lags a bit is with the auto focus system: it's just too slow at the very times you need it to work faster than it can.  The issue remains a nuisance from kit lenses to the DA* SDM lenses in low-light or with moving objects.  Live-View was not something I cared much about, but since it's there it has come in handy at times for inconspicuous pointing of the camera at non-moving objects or confirming focus when in manual focus mode.  My only complaint is that its not as refined in its operation as I'd prefer, and it makes odd clunky-clattery noises when its in use.  Another feature that could use some improvement is the Auto ISO setting where the camera selects the ISO between a range you specify.  The problem is that it defaults to the lowest ISO which could result in a shutter speed as low as 1/80.  This is too slow for anything moving, and I've lost opportunities to blurred pictures because of this.  More expensive cameras have the ability to specify a minimum shutter speed as the secondary setting to this feature.  Perhaps Pentax has it somewhere, but I just haven't found it.  The last nit pick I have is with the shutter sound.  It's a little bit sharper and quieter than the K10, but I really don't care for the sound on either camera - too \"squeaky/clangy.\"In the balance, however, there are a multitude of plusses to this camera that make it great such as the quality of the photos, the flexibility to custom adjust just about anything connected to the picture image and capture (too many to mention), the RAW file handling, in-camera image stability system, the auto focus adjustment feature, weather sealing, the ergonomics/handling and solid feel of the camera.  The dust mapping and removal is nifty, too.  The dust mapping lets you see a representation of where exactly the dust is on the sensor rather than having to study pictures and transpose the positioning to what you see when looking straight at the sensor from the front. It's also quite sensitive.  It showed the presence of dust when I had a very had time even detecting the dust in photos of blue sky taken with a high f-stop.  Interestingly, the dust shake-off feature of the sensor has never worked for me on either the K10 or the K20.  What always works is to use a manual blower to shoot a few burst of air at the sensor at the right locations.If you want a truly fine camera that lets you stand out from the Canon/Nikon masses without feeling second-rate (so long as you stay out of sports arenas), this camera is a worthy purchase that will get you great results.  I'm surprised at the looks and questions I get from even professional photographers when they see me shooting with the K20 and a DA* lens attached. If you aspire to professional levels of photography without the typical high accessory costs incurred by Nikon/Canon shooters, this is probably one of the best mid-level cameras going.  And Pentax is continuing to introduce more professional lenses on par with those from Canon and Nikkor at significantly lower cost.", "Date": "June 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "A hands on review of Pentax's new flagship digital SLR", "Author": "James E. Maynard", "ReviewID": "R26ETTOJKV7IGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Pentax owner since the 1950's when the first Heiland Pentax SLR was introduced to the market. This is my 3rd Pentax digital SLR, the first two being the 6 megapixel 1stDS and the 10 megapixel K10D. This new model is a significant upgrade from the K10D, and at 14.6 megapixels, provides significantly more resolution in the crops I make from the original images. What this allows is for me to go to smaller crops  (increased area enlargement) and still maintain excellent resolution. Another significant feature is the new imaging device from Samsung, producing, for me, low noise excellent quality  photos at sensitivities as high as 1600 ISO.To me, one of the most significant features of this camera, also found on my earlier K10D, is the RAW button on the left side of the camera body. This enables me to shoot most of my photos in JPEG, but allows me to go to RAW for a single image that I really want to get the most out of. This feature really conserves memory card space, but allows shooting of intermittent RAW images when they are really needed. This is a feature that I believe is unique to Pentax. At the highest quality (least compression) JPEG setting, the camera produces 10 megabyte images, which provide plenty of detail and excellent color.The quality of the shake reduction capability seems, to me, to be improved over the K10D. I have been able to shoot sharp photos at F3.5 at a 30th of a second at a focal length of 250 mm.The camera is extremely well built and, for this reason, is slightly heavier than other brands of comparable size. But the small extra weight and the fact that the camera feels well in the hand makes for really steady shots.A new feature is live image production on the 2.7 inch rear screen, which is somewhat larger than that on the  K10D. Being a long time SLR user, I don't use this feature very much. But it seems to be the up and coming thing on new digital SLR's.The internal software of the camera has really been upgraded and includes an in camera capability to convert RAW images to TIFF or JPEG, a really neat feature if one is on the road and doesn't have access to the computer software necessary to process RAW images but yet wants to view them on other portable imaging devices.I bought my camera without a lens and separately purchased the new 18-250 F 3.5-6.3 Pentax zoom lens and the 50 mm F 1.4 Pentax lens, which serves as a very short telephoto, wonderful for taking pictures of people. This is the combination I would recommend. The 18-250 appears to be manufactured for Pentax by TAMRON and is an excellent lens in my opinion. It is also quite versatile, giving a 28 mm field of view at wide angle and 375 mm at full telephoto. The 50mm F 1.4 is really inexpensive, at about $199 from reputable internet dealers, and is one of the sharpest lenses ever produced by Pentax. This lens is a real \"sleeper\" and should be owned by any Pentax DSLR owner for low light and portrait photography.At about $1250-1299 street price for the body alone, the camera is not cheap. But it is a prosumer model and priced somewhat below comparable Canon and Nikon models. It is providing me with wonderful performance and I highly recommend it.Dr. James E.

Unbelievable photographic tool!", "Author": "Alex Vox", "ReviewID": "R2ISWJY2BT968X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a pleasure to use this Pentax's baby for three days. This camera takes photography as far as it never was before under $8.000 price tag. The image quality is stunning. I especially like this rich tremendous color rendition that looks like mid format color slide of 6x9. The tone gradations are simply endless. If you take picture of sunset it will be the best sunset you ever seen.I will not describe endless technical data details but I must stress how smart, convenient and relevant all the menus! You have a photography tools in your hands, not the computerized toy for browsing menus. The controls placement is the best I ever seen in any brand. Everything is under your fingers, everything is assignable. The camera reacts in the way you expect, it feels solid, complete.It is pleasure to hold it, the balance is very good. This camera's software allows remote shooting (just like k10d) and if used in studio may be entirely controlled by computer. The ability to use the internal flash as a controller is very nice! The ability to store preview is very nice! The shift preview on shutter is super cool! The viewfinder is nice, clear and bright!If you had experience with K10D, you will find these awesome Pentax invented modes related to auto ISO settings.The image quality is second to none. While there are many good cameras are around, this one of the league on itself. The tonality, sharpness, expressiveness of this cam is outstanding. What is even more outstanding is the combination of shooting experiences that end up in the final image. You feel that you control it to any degree you wish. The final image may be whatever you tune it to be. Make a profile and get it over sharpened as Canon, oversaturated as Sony or over contrasted as Nikon. Mix is in any way you pleased. You have any number of cameras inside. I personally enjoyed portraits and nature shots I made with it. With awesome tonal variations, countless gradations in shadows, natural and lifelike skin tones. This camera does equally good job on dark skins as well. And it looks real, photographically rich and not exaggerated.In short, my three days of hands on experience with this camera I walked off very impressed. Hugely impressed.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "First impression: I love it!", "Author": "nsv", "ReviewID": "R2SFNP78J17HPQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only shot about 1700 images so far, so I haven't fully explored all the new features on this camera.  This is my first impression and I'll update this review as I become more familiar with it.I've used the K10D since it came out, and the K20D is a strong addition to the line.  The new sensor is amazing.  Live View is very handy when you're reaching to get the camera into an awkward position.  I haven't needed the Dust Alert feature yet, but since I shoot in less than clean conditions, I'm guessing it will come in handy.One of the features of the K10D that they've kept, and the primary reason I switched to Pentax in the first place, is the construction of the body with 72 seals to keep water and dust out.  I've used the K10D in the pouring rain, in sea spray, and in smoky or dusty, windy conditions, and never had a problem.  I've started to expose the K20D to the same conditions, and I expect the same performance.The Shake Reduction is also fantastic, especially for my shaky hands.  It doesn't replace a tripod, but it does allow me to shoot handheld in lower lighting than I ordinarily could.  Since I have several lenses, it's also a money saving feature for me.5/26/08 update: Three additional comments:I've used this camera in both pouring rain and windy dusty conditions (not at the same time, obviously.)  Since the body construction didn't seem dramatically different from the K10D, I expected it to survive my abuse, and so far it has.Live View with a tripod and a wireless remote is heaven in awkward positions!  No more contorting my body to squeeze into difficult spaces!  (Well, ok, I do that for long enough to focus, then stand comfortably and switch to Live View.  You can use the AF button to focus while using Live View, but I guess I'm a little old fashioned, and I like seeing my subject in focus in the viewfinder.)It can be frustrating waiting for the images to write to the card, especially when you shoot in Continuous Shooting mode and shoot six or eight images at a time.  But since part of that is due to the speed of the card and part of it is due to the size of the images, I can't complain about the camera here.  If you are shooting multiple large raw files quickly, BUY FAST CARDS.I've just scanned the manual and didn't notice the maximum capacity, but I'm using 8GB SDHC cards.Now that I've spent a little time using it, I love this camera even more.", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Christer Medin", "ReviewID": "R3OMX3468RTOLN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was quite an upgrade from the Samsung GX-1S (clone of *ist DS2) I used previously .  Pentax have always put out nice products but haven't really been pushing the envelope until now.The bad:Auto white balance is still pretty poor.  This has been the case with the other Pentax DSLRs.  Certainly not a huge concern--especially if you shoot RAW--but a little annoying considering other manufacturers seem to manage it much better.It has a tendency to underexpose.  Normally I find myself shooting with +0.7EV compensation and rarely do I run into situations where it blows out the highlights with that setting.The good:Absolutely outstanding image quality.  I have shot everything from 110 to large format in film, and the first thing that struck me looking at some of the K20D shots was that it looks like medium format film: the ultra-smooth gradations and gorgeous tones.The lens focus adjustment!  Both my Pentax SMCPDA 16-45mm Zoom f/4.0 ED/AL Lens for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras and Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 DG Macro Telephoto Zoom Lens for Pentax and Samsung SLR Cameras required some adjustments to compensate for slight front and back focusing.  Without this feature I would have been stuck with lenses that would not focus perfectly wide open.The viewfinder.  Large, bright, clear.TAv mode.  I spend 90% of my time shooting in this; Pentax treats ISO like a third variable in addition to shutter speed and aperture.  Simple and brilliant.  You just adjust the shutter speed and aperture with the wheels and it tells you the ISO so you can make a judgment call on a good compromise between all three.Clever battery grip design that lets you store a spare SD card and remote.Nice high ISO performance.  I have shots at 5000 that look good, though 6400 is pretty noisy.Hands-off noise reduction.  Default is OFF, which lets you control it entirely in post-processing.  Much rather have that than the water color paintings other cameras prefer to output.Again, AMAZING image quality.  I was worried that they were pushing the sensor too far with 14.6mp but they manage to control noise and retain wonderful detail.  It does require good optics to get the most out of it, so I would recommend looking at some high quality glass.  The 16-45/4 is one of the bargains out there; tack sharp, great color and contrast, and just around $300 new.If Pentax could do a little better on the white balance and metering it would be absolutely perfect for me.

I initially upgraded from a Canon Rebel 300D to a Canon 40D, it was a nice upgrade but the new Canon wasn't bringing me enough enjoyment to be worth the near thousand dollars I paid for it, and I knew it would lead me to buying lenses that would be too heavy and expensive. I sent it back and a moth later decided to buy the K20d.  I was impressed with the low price and low weight of Pentax's mid-range lenses. I honestly thought that the camera itself wouldn't be as good as the 40D but I decided to follow the mantra that lenses are what matter and thought I could sell my Canon lenses and get some great Pentax prime lenses, and a wide zoom lens.I have had the K20d for a over a month, and it is a great camera. It takes the pictures that I want it to take. This is the first digital camera I've been really excited about using and I think it is because it allows me to get the exact exposure I want.  The metering won't produce as many decent pictures on full auto as a Canon, because it will always preserve bright highlights. The reviews say that it underexposes, because if you take a picture of a person with the sky behind them, it will consistently keep the sky from blowing out - making the person too dark. At first this means more missed and underexposed shots, but it exposes the same way all the time, and after a week with the camera I found that I always knew how the camera was metering and I now get the exact exposure I want on the first shot far more often than I used to.The camera also makes manual mode far more useable.  I like finding a good exposure for the light and then sticking to that as long as I know I am in similar light.  If my photos are looking a little bright or a little dark on the histogram, I change the shutter speed or aperture a click. With the green button, I can be in manual mode but have an automatic resetting any time the light changes, from full sun to shade.  Anytime I know that there is a big change in light I hit the green button and get the automatic exposure setting, instead of having to spin the dials.I like the ability to change what the dials and buttons do in many of the modes.  I can customize what the control wheels do in each picture mode.  Also note that many reviews say the K20d does not show ISO in the viewfinder (which was a big detractor for me since it was one feature I really liked about the 40D upgrade) but actually you can customize this and show ISO in the viewfinder instead of the number of remaining shots.  You can also change ISO in any mode by holding OK while turning the finger wheel.Negatives: The K20d does produce more noise over ISO 800 than the Canon, but I like that it keeps more detail and I like the grain of the noise far better.  However sometimes in very high ISO shots there can be too much chroma noise (colored noise) to do anything but convert to BW, and in two or three pictures I have seen banding in high ISO pictures when I try to push them a stop in my raw converter. Also the auto-focus sometimes hunts in single shot mode in light that the 40D would handle, although I have found that if I put it on AF-Continuous (AI Servo in Canon) it usually finds focus.  My understanding is that the Pentax AF system attempts to be more exact, and I think I have noticed that when I am in good light I have less missed pictures due to focus than with the Canon.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pentax K20D 14.6MP Review", "Author": "Frank \"power producer\"", "ReviewID": "R3LGA28EF834Y3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pentax K20D 14.6MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction (Body Only)We are amateur photo shooters and have a 5 year old digital Kodak - which was okay for snap shooting -Now for the PENTAX K20D 14.6MP Digital Camera we offer this review.It is the TRUE amateur's friend.  It is in a completely different class to the old technology, including 35mm film format.  It is way ahead in the performance field for its class of digital camera.  We are glad to be back in the SLR type of camera too.Right after arrival of our new K20D camera we did a PROM photo session on our patio with 5 couples - what a pleasure to shoot when you have the time right - what is the right time? - a series of shots 2, 3, 4 or 5 with each setting and this camera is so fast you can outshoot the point and shoots by a mile - and great results too - Our daughter was assisting with her PENTAX K10D and both of these DIGITAL CAMERA'S are recommended highly by us.  We experienced a number of comments from others sharing in this event, what kind of camera is that?  It must be nice to be able to take so many shots and capture all of these special moments!

The combination of these two lenses and the K20D offers some of the best semi-pro quality available for the money.There are 4 main features that made me buy this camera:1) Price. Hands down, it is in my opinion, the most value for your money.2) Weather proofing. 72 weather proofing seals on the camera body and coatings on their DA series lenses make this camera ideal for travel.3) Top-side LCD panel. This is a must-have feature for anyone serious about photography.4) Front AND Rear dials. This allows for quick modifications of various camera settings and are customizable for each exposure mode.Regarding image quality - the camera is somewhat important as we're now dealing with sensors instead of film, but the glass (lenses) are without a doubt the most important element of the equation. So - that said, you should seriously consider replacing the kit lens with a DA* or Limited series lens as soon as possible. The kit lens is very good (compared especially to competitor kit lenses).

Having to decide between Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Olympus, and Sony was difficult after reading so many reviews.  I took a chance on the Pentax based on forums & reviews.  I couldn't find the camera in any stores around my home other than the other brands mentioned.  The Pentax does feel the best in my hands and when I first held it, it is definitely better built than the others.  I bought the 18-55mm AL II kit lens and it does excellent and will purchase the 18-250mm in the future.  I have taken the same type shots with my Minolta film camera from the early 80's and this camera surpasses it in quality.  I was stubborn for a long time to switch to digital after having the money invested in the Minolta lenses and other equipment.  I personally think all the major cameras are good and I picked Pentax on a leap of faith.  It was the best camera for the money and future lenses and accessories won't break the bank.  I have not much use yet for the live view feature but many of the features are usable and intuitive.  I really like the idea and flexibility of the front and rear e-dials.  I can adjust the aperture with the rear dial and the shutter speed with the front dial.  If I could change anything I would make the ISO a dedicated button and maybe the white balance.  At least they are at the beginning of the Fn(function) menu button and only requires one extra button to push.  I would highly recommend this camera unless you shoot alot of sports which the 3 frames per second burst rate doesn't cut it for you.  The picture quality is A-1 and the cropping in on some shots I've taken are just great since I don't have a strong zoom lense yet.  They don't pixelate on the computer and that has to be the 14.1 megapixels at work  with the CMOS sensor.

Bought instead of Nikon 300 or Canon", "Author": "javajunki", "ReviewID": "R1QQJ8NVI56JIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, a quick disclaimer - I'm not a pro but probably fall into the serious amateur category after falling in love with my old Minolta Maxxum 7000 over 20 years ago. I'm the person behind the camera at all the parties and occassionally get the exceptional shot worthy of a few \"oooh and ahhhs\". I've also been holding out on buying anything more than a simple toss around digital until the cost and quality of dslr's were to my liking. As the price and quality of 10+ mp dslr's are now in the comfort range I decided to chuck the point and shoot junk I've been making do with and began shopping in earnest. After testing the Canon the speed seemed nice but I wasn't impressed so I narrowed it down to the Nikon 300 - it seemed to have everything I was searching for in a versatile camera. After adding decent quality lenses, storage, a few extras etc the price was going to come in at roughly $3,500 on sale...not bad but enough to make me take one last look around. On spur of the moment my better half said take a look at Pentax - they have been around forever and are known for making above average lens.So, the K20D pops up with a 14+ mp on sale for $800 or 1/2 the Nikon...so far so good but I was a bit nervous about ordering it despite the good reviews. I spent the better part of the day researching the camera  and decided to give it a shot [sorry - bad pun].Ordered the K20D ($800), 8 gb card ($35), battery grip ($120), extra battery pack ($20), remote ($20) tripod ($18 on special), camera strap (free promo) and the Pentax 18-250 mm lense ($350). For $1350 I now have a very versatile camera for almost a 1/3 of the price of the Nikon....suffice to say based on price alone I'm one happy shopper. UPDATE: also added the Tamron 90mm Macro with 1:1 for another $365 after rebate. Good additional lens with a few issues (see my review on it separately). Between the two - have a nice 1:1 macro and portrait lens with a terrific \"all around\" lens...also added several filters [uv, polarizing, close up] an inexpensive tripod and another inexpensive monopod plus some excellent books...all for less than the cost of the Nikon with one lens!Now, for the performance, look feel etc. The 14+ mp really make a difference - resolution is excellent and compares favorable to film. For the first time I don't feel like I'm missing anything major. This camera takes some beautiful shots even with my own limited testing.The weight and feel are very nice - everything is ergonomically correct at least for my hands, intuitive access on all controls, solid and best of all - sealed! Screen size is adequte and I really appreciate the ability to set colors, font size and other adaptations to fit my needs. Diopter is also adjustable. The lens is reviewed apart but was a great all around choice - responsive and adequate although I intend to purchase additional dedicated/primary lens options soon. One thing I REALLY like about this Pentax is the backward compatibility - Pentax DSLR's allow the use of older Pentax lens so eBay and other options become a great way to find a quality lens at an affordable price. Since my old pricey Minolta lens' are no longer of any use that is a big bonus at least until Sony puts something decent on the market. In the meantime, this was a good starter lense [18-250 mm] that works well with the camera.The menu and pre-sets are easy to use and versatile although I quickly found myself preferring manual - that is just a personal bias however. Preview was easy to use. There are a lot of negative mention regarding the Live screen option...having been playing with slr's for 20+ years I've never used the screen to take photos with but tested it for a few minutes and found it easy enough to use - just not sensitive to take a quality photo. It is possible to zoom in the live preview mode (contrary to what a few have mentioned) but all in all - it's not a feature I use enough to make a valid statement about.The only other \"flaw\" that makes the camera less than perfect is the 3fps - it is substantially slower than other DSLR's on the market. Since I rarely shoot sports or have need for speed - it isn't a major consideration for me however, I would have gone with the Nikon if it were. This camera is able to shoot rapid series of shots in low quality settings of up to 21 fps - a fun little addition for playing around with but with a quality so low it isn't going to give more than email quality.A few things I REALLY liked about the camera - other than price, resolutoin and intuitive design were several of the upgraded features. In addition to sealing both the camera and battery pack, the ability to take shots in raw and jpeg format at the same time is a great option. Likewise, this is fully compatible with adobe format so saves need for changing formats or fooling around with various options - just set on dual use and go. The battery pack with an extended memory card expand this to a considerable level. I was able to get about 750 pictures off just one battery using a flash part of the time and high resolution settings. The battery pack is very ergonomic, adds a battery back-up that is easy to switch and also allows storage for an additional card and remote control. When fully charged I expect to put at least 1500 photos on the card and battery before changing out - easily.The camera comes with battery and charger, inexpensive camera strap - neigther were mentioned when I was buying so I ordered a battery charger that had to return.One additional note - in addition to 10% off the price of a decent/versatile lens - be sure to register before the end of the year. Pentax is offeringa FREE upgrade to 3 year warranty on this purhcase!!! That beats all others hands-down. In addition to the pentax 18-250 mm lens, I also purchased the Tamron 90 mm macro which has a $90 rebate AND 6 year warranty right now. Good stuff! Good deals - even if Amazon has lowered the price $35 since I bought this a week ago [argh] and offers a free camera case that I missed [double argh]. Still very pleased.Will try to review again after having owned/used but so far REALLY pleased with price, performance and resolution of the camera.UPDATE: I've now owned this for several week and had a couple opportunities to use it in different settings - outdoor shots, inside with a little \"mini studio\" for portraits, some macro work etc... although the \"user\" [myself] is rusty and still learning all this camera is capable of doing - the results are consistently great....even when I thought they would be inferior. The range of this camera is pretty amazing especially in low light settings or shadows where other camera's begin to show extreme noise. Side by side comparison to a more expensive Canon model - this took more clear shots hands down...in fact, this can actually allow ISO settings up to 6400 {although not great quality at that level] whereas the Canon can't even attempt it. At more modest levels, this handles photos with ease while the Canon has already started showing serious noise distortion.In fact, the one issue I've run into while taking portraits was \"too true to life\". This camera shows every detail - much to the dismay of at least one or two aging family members. Of course, that is easy to correct in a good program but if resolution is what you are searching for this one has it!Another great feature is the bracketing. I'm interested in pursuing a bit of High Dynamic Range photography - something new that is made possible by the digital format. I've not had an opportunity to delve into this much yet but the resolution of this camera combined with the bracketing feature make it a LOT easier to get started in this creative endeavor. After purchasing several books on the topic I was a little worried about the complexity - no need. This camera makes it relatively simple to try out this fun and creative new method. While it isn't something I plan to use all the time, it IS a fun and exciting area that expands the entire photography field beyond what was ever possible with film.Finally, for those that appreciate black and white photos - I can report this provides a very nice redition. This was originally another area of concern for me since so many digital pictures seem to have either a yellow or reddish cast rather than true black and white/greyscale. While much will depend upon who you use for printing the pictures, at least you will find a responsive greyscale with this camera. VERY little to No need for modification in Photoshop - nearly all were excellent straight from the camera setting.Cannot say enough good things - combined with the extended 3 year warranty currently offer [and the big price reduction offered by Amazon...argh] this is a no-brainer.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R2NQ2WIOKHBSLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In March of 2008 I bought a K200D, my first DSLR.  Loved the camera, but wanted more control and more options.  So, I then bought a K20D.-----------------------------------****CONTROLS ::  The controls on the K20D are incredibly awesome.  Everything is just *right*.  Changes from the basic K200D layout:A) External Metering dialB) External bracketing buttonC) External focal point mode dialD) A second e-dial, which is great.I absolutely love, love, love K20D ergonomics and menu system..  I can operate the camera and all its functions without looking at it.  I never press a button I don't intent to press, and I never confuse buttons.  Things just \"make sense\".  It's so hard to describe.  This is worlds different coming from Canon and Nikon comparisons -- Perhaps it was my unfamiliarity with those cameras, but their menu systems, while flashy, were downright confusing.You also have a \"Green Button\" mode and a \"User Mode\" on the K20D which is very interesting -- You can set up a custom \"profile\" on the K20D in User mode which sounds cool, but truthfully I haven't used it yet.****PERFORMANCE:The K20D performs admirably, just like the K200D.  There are a few differences, though:1) The K20D has a MUCH improved buffer - I can shoot 15 RAW files at 3.0FPS (still low), compared to 4 RAW at 2.8 FPS on the K200D.  Unfotunately the FPS on the K20D remains incredibly slow at full resolution.2) The K20D has a \"burst\" mode of 21 FPS at around 1.4MP.  Neat to play around with but nothing special.3) ISO goes up to 3200 standard (K200D is maxed at 1600) with 6400 available.  However, IQ drops severely after ISO 1600.  ISO 3200 is OKAY if you have a picture with non-dark areas, but there is visible banding at ISO3200 and for the most part I avoid it.  I use NoiseNinja on my ISO3200 images and they're acceptable if you're not going to crop.4) A noticeably improved viewfinder -- I can tell the difference immediately over the K200D.  Brighter, nicer.  Lovely.**** IMAGE QUALITYGreat, just like the K200D.  As a matter of fact, I really couldn't tell you the difference in IQ between two 100% crops of the cameras, except that the K20D's crop is going to be slightly larger from the added MP.I've tested this extensively with three lenses (DA 16-45, DA 55-300, DA* 50-135) and there is really no IQ difference between the cameras.  I may need to get a high quality prime to tell the difference, and even then, you'll be pixel peeping.However, the K20D *DOES* allow you to get slightly larger prints before you start interpolating pixels, which is something to consider.****OTHER:Live view - Almost worthless.  I get hot pixels on the image when I use live view for any extended period of time.  I've refused to upgrade to the 1.01 firmware for fear of it breaking some software compatibility.  Nothing really important to me, though, because the Pentax implimentation of Liveview isn't that great.Sealing - Better than the K200D, but by how much I don't know.  The battery and SD card doors are latch opened instead of slide opened like the K200D.Battery Performance -- Pretty good.  Pentax has retained their rather uninformative battery meter, unfortunately.  I really wish they'd get with the times and introduce a %-estimate for their battery meter.Autofocus Speed-- Absolutely zero difference between the K200D and the K20D -- I have tested this extensively with two lenses using a video camera for frame-accurate timing.Autofocus Performance -- Decent.  Low light it suffers (EV5/6 or lower), but tries for accuracy, so I'm not sure what to say.  I wish it were faster.OVERALL --- A highly recommended camera.  Pentax makes some great glass.  Match them up with a K20D and ENJOY shooting photos.  The camera is an absolute ergonomic and control-layout pleasure to use.  Menus make sense.  Performance is good with just a few small things to gripe about.I really like the camera and it's recommended for those people not needing very fast FPS or first-party lenses past 300mm.", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "A truly Image Quality Revolution!", "Author": "TOKUSHI \"TOKUSHI\"", "ReviewID": "R3R7QUHOJAS9LG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If IQ is the most important aspect for you then K20D is definitely for you.

Parkes", "ReviewID": "RJ694I1QGO983", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was the unfortunate victim of a thief. My camera bag containing all of my equipment was stolen. I had the new Nikon D90 and loved it. My insurance company reluctantly awarded me a check that covered about a third of the replacement cost for the Nikon gear I lost. I decided that until I had saved enough money to replace the D90 I would buy a less expensive camera to pass the time.  Let me start by saying I'm not a pro, but have a few years as an amateur. I spent a week doing research online (thank you dpreview). The result was the Pentax K20D. I purchased it from Amazon for 669, an absolute bargain as it turns out. My wonderful family gifted me with the DA 18-55mm version 2, the 55-300mm telephoto, and the battery grip, all made by Pentax.  The build quality is the best I've ever experienced!! Stainless steel frame inside a plastic fiber reinforced exterior shell, more rubber seals than you can imagine, and sealed doors for the memory and battery ( real doors!!). The lenses are as rugged as the body and battery grip, with terrific rubber grips grooved deeply, making a solid and rugged feel that I'm in love with. The Pentax weighs about a third more than the D90 but it feels great and I think it gives me a steadier hand. I think the ergonomics are better than Nikon or Cannon, and It's about the same body size as the D90, I miss the Nikon LCD but I wouldn't go back.  The picture quality is just mind blowing, the D90 produced great pictures as well, and I think that this camera equals it in most cases, and exceeds it in others. I've read reviews that claim the K20D shows excessive noise at ISO 1600+, but I rarely ever shoot above 800 so it's not an issue for me. Another issue for reviewers was the frame rate, only 10% of my work is sports or other projects that would necessitate a high frame rate so this camera is fine for me. The K20D produces large image files, a product of a 14.6 mp sensor, and my choice of file type, so it can be slow to save to the memory card. I need to research faster SD cards.  I have about 2000 photographs under my belt with this camera and until Pentax updates the K20D I won't be looking for another. The in body shake reduction reduces the cost of lenses and works very well. Live view, and articulating LCD screens are not something I'm interested in so those innovations missing or not done well on this model are not an issue for me. If you want or need either of those buy a point and shoot, this camera is designed for experienced shooters and doesn't have a lot of the automatic or 'green' modes that entry level DSLR cameras have, Pentax makes those cameras but I don't own one.  If you are shopping for a camera this is a great piece of equipment and the peripherals made by Pentax are outstanding. I have only one complaint and that is the LCD screen as compared to the Nikon D90, I hope that tops the list for the next incarnation of the K20D.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade to K10D with new features (Not just more megapixels)", "Author": "Doug Milligan", "ReviewID": "R15DIYR49NF061", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used my K10D for two years and never thought I'd replace it.  I played with the K20D at PMA and thought although it was a better body, it wasn't so much better to justify ditching the K10D as my primary body.  I decided to wait until the next body, perhaps the ?K30D? came out and pick up the K20D at a steal.  Watching the price drop, I decided to go ahead and get a K20D.  I cannot be more pleased with the K20D.There are some really nice touches and additions to the K20D compared to the K10D, many of them not mentioned anywhere I've seen.  One addition that I think is nice is that the auto-bracketing can be set to fire 3 or 5 times with one shutter button release.  (You don't have to hold the release button down)  The shutter sound is less harsh compared to the K10D, closer to to  Nikon sound (not a big deal, but it just sounds better)I have taken some test shots at the higher iso levels, couldn't be more pleased.  Noise is still there at an iso of 1600, but almost non-existent at lower levels.  The K20D takes much better low light photos vs. the K10DI have to admit I gave thoughts a few months ago to jumping to the Nikon platform.  I borrowed a N90 and a N300 from a shop to see if they were that much better then the K10D I had.  Although the Nikons are great bodies, I felt the Pentax K10D had features I needed and had a better feel in my hands.  The only thing I liked better with the Nikons was the burst speed, which the Pentax bodies admittedly perform poorly.  Then again, I'm not going to be taking pictures at the Olympics or a Nascar race anytime soon, so the 3fps on the Pentax bodies suites me.  Now, with seeing the additional features on the K20D, I know I made the right choice to stick with the Pentax platform instead of going to the Nikon platform.

In short, while it's a very good camera, it might not be a worthwhile upgrade for current K10D owners.Focus speed of the K20D is about the same as the K10D, just a little quieter. The 3 fps continuous shooting performance is nice, but the similarly speced Canon 40D and Nikon D300 have much faster continuous shooting performance.

In reality all cameras are just tools.  Having to work around the quarks and shortcomings of the K100DS I have learned to work with the Pentax system.  No Pentax doesn't have the worlds fastest AF, but in all honesty sports shooters will tell you they shoot in manual and honestly until the price of the K7 comes down you can live with it or buy a Nikon D3x for $7000.  Yes the meter underexposes, but this is more a thing of understanding when and which (spot, center, multi) meter has this tendency.  The high iso is crap, but so is the high iso on every apc-s sensor.  Some look better than others, but these sensors aren't full-frame and they shouldnt as of yet be expected to perform in this way.

Throw even an old Pentax-M lens on it, set the camera to manual, set your aperture, touch the \"Green Button\", and the camera sets the programmed exposure - you can adjust from there to your heart's content. You can even specify the kind of program used by the green button - optimized for fast shutter speeds or depth of field - or the sharpest  resolution settings of the appropriate lens. You can pick up used Pentax lenses all over for next to nothing, excellent glass on par with any manufacturer. Pentax glass is known for its color saturation and contrast, and this camera shows it off.I don't want to just repeat what's already been said, but I also have to say - this is a photographer's camera. It does everything you'd want a camera to do, and then some. The \"Hyper Program\" is unbelievably cool - you touch the shutter, it sets the exposure, then you roll dials to adjust from there. Absolutely transparent. You can customize the functions of the wheels to a ridiculously convenient level - this can be any camera you want it to be.

It really is a good camera in many respects. However, if you have special requirements, such as long exposures (e.g. astrophotography), this is NOT the camera to purchase.The K20D uses a new and jointly developed Samsung CMOS imager. Unfortunately, they have not worked out all the kinks... um... namely heat! As a result, the K20D produces a significant amount of noise (hot pixels) and this is why the K20D is the *ONLY* current DSLR camera that forces the user to endure an automatic DFS (Dark Frame Subtraction) for any length of exposure in Bulb mode (or any manual/automatic exposure greater than 15 seconds). This means that a 2 minute exposure is actually 4 minutes, a 30 minute exposure will take 1 hour, and so on...If money is no object, consider Canon or Nikon. Canon is especially prized by astrophotographers as being the best DSLR for long exposures.The other annoying problem is that the K20D is terribly slow (and even worse in low light) with auto focus! Again, Canon and Nikon do a much better job.Other than two major complaints.... I echo the positive attributes spoken by others about this camera.The K20D loses two stars (out of five) because of the forced DFS and high noise levels.

At this price....Secondly, I wouldn't buy the kit lens.  I did, and I hardly ever use it.  It's OK, well built and not expensive.  But it won't give you those WOW factor photos you'd expect from your investment in a top quality DSLR.  If you want that WOW factor, I personally recommend you move fast to find a good deal on the Pentax FA 50mm f1.4 prime lens.  If you can get one for under $260 (at time of writing), you'll have a wonderful, low cost prime.  But do it right now, before it goes the same way as the top rated 35mm f2, which is now hard to find and expensive. It'll help you take wonderful photos, particularly portraits in-doors without flash.  Its very, very sharp outdoors.  I'll guarantee friends and relations will say:  great photos, what camera are you using?  And camera experts will say:  great photos, what lens are you using?  You may have to jump around a bit to get a good composition with its focal point - but why not look like a serious photographer?  It you can't or don't want to invest in a top quality lens, then I'd stick with a point and shoot or consider the next two options.Thirdly, for maximum entertainment, I'd buy a value-for-money zoom lens like the Tamron 70-300mm macro.  This lens isn't the best of breed.  You can go that route when you've mastered all the \"photographer's at fault\" issues - or if you have money to burn.  It's a lot of fun outdoors and it'll produce very fine photos (up to around 250mm).  I've used it for numerous photos of my 6 and 7 year old girls playing with pets, friends, creepy crawlies, as well as other \"Daddy objects\" far away, like planes and the moon.  Plus it has a macro feature that is a bit of a hassle to set but works well.  In other words - it's a lot of fun!Fourthly, try an old Pentax/Takumar lens on the body.  Go shopping on eBay you'll find some of the greatest ever lenses/glass for sale at ridiculous prices (compared to new lenses).  Buy a proper Pentax adaptor, change the aperture ring setting in the Custom Setting Menu to: 2 Permitted, so that the shake reduction will work on a totally manual lens, and you'll be able to take some fantastically evocative photos.  I've got three 35 year old Takumars, and its amazing the range of photo styles I can produce - from razor sharp to creamy \"1960s\" looking colors.  You'll really get to know how to use the camera to its full potential.  My Takumar 55mm is the my pick.  The only real problem is that with manual focus its hard to catch fast moving children.  But then its back to the FA 50mm.Finally, the expert reviewers are right, you DO need to (and shouldn't have to) + EV compensate most times to get a perfect exposure, and sometimes the auto focus could be better, but they are quirks you can overcome...also...if you have Canon software from your point and shoot digital camera, use this for managing and sending out your photos, its easier than learning the Pentax software...UPDATE November 2009.  Can't say I didn't warn buyers.  In August you could buy the Pentax 50mm for $260.  Now its heading towards $400 and rising.  Just like the old 35mm.  Would I buy the 50mm at $400?  Yes, just.  Its a super lens.  But any higher and I'd look at another great lens: the Sigma 50mm 1.4  Its big, its heavy, but its very good.

They are simple easy to use cameras with the controls in just the right place to give the operator complete freedom to take any shot.  You won't find yourself winding into a pretzel in order to make a simple adjustment.The K20D is a fantastic camera that performs like one 3 or 4 times its price.  I have shot images of all types and brightnesses and have found it to be excellent.  The brightness curve is a little low and will need to be brought up a little but this is far better then being too high and blowing out detail.The battery life is excellent allowing me to get 750-1000 shots before needing to make a change.  I use little flash so I can enjoy the full colors of my setting without blown out spots and bad reflections.I have great night vision and the auto focus will start to loose it a little before I do.  I can quickly switch to manual focus and keep on shooting.  I avoid pushing the ISO over 800 to minimize noise.  You will find the detail is still excellent at high ISOs where other cameras will sacrifice detail to keep the noise to a minimum.  I personally would rather have a full detail shot with a little noise of that important moment then a low noise low detail shot.My lens choice is the DA 18-250mm.  This is a fantastic lens that surprisingly does the whole range well.  When I shot film I was constantly in need of lenses and would often carry 3-5 on me.  This lens will almost do it all.  I am still planning on getting a wide of 10-12mm and a longer zoom of 400m or more.The in body shake reduction system allows me to shoot down to 1/2 second while holding the camera.  I have been doing this for a long time and have trained myself to hold very still but with it off, the best I can do is 1/15th.  I would still recommend a tripod but knowing I can still take the shot in almost any condition is very comforting.The bottom line is that this camera is well worth the money.

I've had it for about a week now and still learning about all these features. Probably not a good DSLR for a beginner as in this camera there literally are knobs with knobs on them. The behavior is almost absurdly customizable, but, on the other hand, if you know what you are doing, you can really bring out the power of this camera. Some of the features that I like:1) In-camera RAW processing. Shoot an image in raw mode, but if you don't have the computer to develop, you can develop them while in the camera into JPEGs.2) Many-many modes of shooting multiple frames at different rates.3) Multiple exposure mode (with automatic EV compensation). Helps creates interesting effects.4) Look and feel - very solid5) Support for many older Pentax lenses (although if your older lens doesn't have the 'A' automatic aperture setting, it's not easy to use, as exposure evaluation is only available in the optical preview, and not while you're framing live - I'd put that as a minus)6) 3 preview modes: still, live and optical (for testing depth of field and exposure). Live view isn't terribly useful. I'm still wondering why people want it.7) Extreme programmability8) In-camera shake reduction (means I can use my older 200mm lens and get the benefit of it)9) The 18-55mm lens is a pretty decent general-purpose lens. You'd need something else if you want to do macro shots or want that up-close-and-personal zoom at 500ft.Some minuses:1) The RAW processing software, while definitely usable, seems to have been written last century. Claims to only work on XP SP2 and Vista, but works fine on my Win2K. Anyway, anyone serious about RAW processing will probably invest in something more substantial.2) As I said earlier - buttons with buttons on them. Can be intimidating, I'm still finding myself running after the manual once in a while. On the other hand, I'm continuously discovering new things ('..I didn't know it could do that!..')3) See my note about older lenses.I've compared it against similar SONY and Nikon offerings in the past, and have no regrets with buying this one.

I have absolutely loved the in camera shake reduction.  My general use lense is a Sigma 28-300.  I was shooting a pickup basketball game at our church this weekend at around 200 handheld in shutter speed priority and getting excellent shots.  I've used all the modes at some point in the past six weeks or so and they all work wonderfully well though I can't imagine when ISO priority will actually be my main consideration in a shoot.  I have only had one complaint and that came shooting lightning shots at night.  The camera takes about 80% as long to write the information to the card as the aperature was left open.  I have done some research and have learned that card speed might be a factor so I have some 30m cards coming,... I'll update if these improve this weakness.

What I haven't seen mentioned is how good this camera is for landscape and high dynamic range (HDR) photography.First I'll mention that the K20D has a depth of field preview. I know it's a feature that a lot of people don't use but it quite helpful if you're serious about shooting landscapes.Next, there is no camera at anywhere near the current price of the K20D that has an equivalent exposure bracketing feature. Some like the Nikon D40 and D60 completely lack one, though they are still good cameras. Others like the Canon X series models offer 3 exposures with at most 1 stop of compensation. It's the same with Olympus and Sony. Again, these are all good cameras but if you are looking to do HDR work please consider the Pentax K20d.You get either 3 or 5 exposures of bracketing with up to 2 stops compensation per exposure. That makes HDR photos very easy to do. You don't have to fiddle with the camera between exposures and can be sure that you haven't moved your camera. The remote control works from either the front or back of the camera, which isn't the case with all makes. Again, that makes taking multiple exposures with the exact same focus easy. You can also set the self-timer at 2 seconds. The camera will not wait for 2 seconds then snap off quick multiple shots. It waits the full 2 seconds between each exposure, which gives the camera time to stop vibrating. That ensures spot on focus for multiple exposures.Add in the weather/dust sealing and extremely solid build and you have a great landscape camera that also happens to be a good all-round performer. The sensor is excellent and gives as good an excellent image especially if you shoot in raw format. If you don't you might look at a less expensive model as you won't be gaining full advantage of what the camera offers. That's not just with this camera but any more capable DSLR.Another advantage of buying Pentax, Olympus or Sony cameras is the built in shake reduction. That makes the purchase of additional lenses much less expensive. Shake reduction or image stabilization can add an appreciable amount to lens price. Since you're buying an interchangeable lens camera and the eventual cost of lenses can far outstrip the cost of the body that can add up to significant savings. And Pentax lenses, which are excellent are generally less expensive than those of other camera manufacturers. The same can be said of accessories like external flashes, even battery chargers.A number of reviewers have mentioned that the camera has a slow burst speed. Kind of. To really get an increase of burst speed, we're talking at least double the speed, to really make a difference you will have to spend a whole lot more. An increase of half a frame a second honestly doesn't make a real world difference.It is true that the camera auto-focuses a bit slowly in low light with the kit lens.

(so far i've yet to shoot in a hard rain though)Update. Had this camera for over a year now.Resolution is still amazing. The white balance thing, set to auto, is usually perfectly fine. For other situations, the manual white balance is great.The screen is hard to see in bright light (as is every other camera i've used) so turning up the brightness helps.Autofocus is pretty fast. At work we use the Nikon D90, which is also pretty fast on autofocus, but isn't as sharp all the time. Also, speaking of nikon; on the pentax, almost every control is customizeable. One of my nitpicking was having to be used to 2 opposite control sets.

I'm not a technical equipment expert but I have plenty of experience using cameras as a tool of my trade. This review relates a few tips and personal impressions about this terrific camera.I actually bought a K10D in January 2007 for a series of research trips in Southeast Asia. I took about 15,000 trouble-free photos with that camera when it was, unfortunately, destroyed in an accident (a fire, incidentally, and I think it would have survived just about anything else).In November 2008 I bought a K20D as a replacement. I bought my K10D with the standard lens. This time I bought the body and lens separately, which gave me a much better camera for my application. I decided on a Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 EX DC SLD ELD Aspherical Macro Lens for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras, which I'll review separately.After my experience with the K10D it was a no-brainer to buy the K20D. Features are similar so there was no learning curve, and all my accessories (Pentax BG2 Battery Grip for Pentax K10D and K20D DSLR Cameras, Tamron AF 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 Di LD Macro Zoom Lens for Pentax Digital SLR Cameras, Pentax AF540FGZ Flash for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras (Includes Case)) were compatible. The K20D is an even better camera with higher image resolution, color enhancement and (I think) improved image stabilization.Battery life is outstanding - Up to 600 shots on one charge, including many with fill in flash and checking each shot in the LCD screen as it's taken. With an extra battery this camera far exceeds my endurance for a day of shooting.Two boy scout tips will make life better (or at least more relaxed) with this camera:1. Buy an extra battery and charger - The uncommon format used in this camera makes these items very difficult to find in local camera stores (impossible to find where I go). No battery or no charger = no pix. I got this inexpensive kit with both 2 Replacement Pentax D-LI50 Batteries and Mini Battery Charger for the K10D & K20D Digital SLR Cameras. Good insurance.2. Take an extra USB cable to download your pix to computer. Like the batteries, the tiny D-shell connection to the K20D body is not a common size. On one trip when I lost this I ended up buying a flashcard USB reader because the cable was nowhere to be found...at least in Cambodia.November 2008 I shot 7,000 trouble free photos in 9 days. High heat, high humidity and occasional jolts (oops) never slow this rugged piece of equipment down.

Amazing ergonomics.  All the customization I need.  Picture quality to salivate for... especially low light capability.  I've owned the previous version of this camera, the Pentax K10d which uses the 10 MP chip made by Sony which is also used in several Nikon cameras like the D80, and high ISO pics (like 800 and above) are a bit noisy in these older cameras which require a bit more work to get rid of the graininess.  The K20d on the other hand is much cleaner at these higher ISO's with a lot of detail.  Most other cameras in this class tend to use a lot of noise reduction at these higher ISO's which makes for a relatively clean picture but these cameras also reduce a lot of sharpness and detail in the process.  The K20d leaves the detail and sharpness and lets me use more advanced noise reduction software to take care of the areas that I think need it (try noiseninja or neat image).Weather sealing - awesome for those who like to hike, sports, or street photography.  I took my camera and a da* Pentax weather sealed lens in to a snowstorm and had no concerns taking pictures... And this kind of build quality that helps keep water and dust out of your camera is something you can feel: the camera is just solid and feels like it laughs at the elements.Image stabilization in the body - EVERY lens you put on this camera will benefit from image stabilization.  I took some pictures in an old church which was not lit well at all, and even without a tripod, I was taking pictures with a 50mm lens at 1/20th of a second and the vast majority of my images were sharp.  My old camera without stabilization required me to have shutter speeds of around 1/80th to get reliably sharp images.  This is a difference of 4 times as much light the camera needs to make an equally exposed picture!  The images at 1/20th are much better exposed and I don't have to turn up the ISO to a point where the image is too grainy like I would have to do on other cameras without stabilization.  This feature is especially important if you take pictures indoors... lower shutter speeds without blinding everybody with flash is so much less intrusive.Custom Focus Adjustment - as much as we expect perfection, lenses often have differences in how they focus.  Being able to adjust the focus forward or backwards on up to 20 lenses is critical if you want razor sharp images.  This is a main reason I upgraded from the K10d... it makes a huge difference!14.6 MP - This much detail is clearly not necessary... unless you need to crop.  I find that if I need a fast lens because of low light (say, if I need an f stop of lower than 2) then I'm usually using a prime lens (fixed focal length = no zoom) and sometimes I can't get as close as I'd like b/c of furniture or maybe the action is happening NOW and I don't have time to move.  With this many megapixels, I can crop a lot and focus on the important part of my picture and still have enough detail to print 8x10's or even 11x14's if I want.Yes, this camera is a few hundred dollars more than an entry level DSLR... but really it should be much, much more expensive than that.  It's an amazing camera that I could easily use for many years.  And my pictures have benefited from it...

The theoretical 15Mpix max resolution for lenses has been hit and you can indeed see this in the K20D's photos if you don't have good lenses.  In particular, it shows you that Pentax's Limited and DA* lenses (except for the 16-50) are indeed ultra sharp and detailed.  My Sigma 17-70 has to be stopped down an extra stop for images to look sharp (my previous 10Mpix K10D was sharper with the Sigma 17-70).The pixel mapping feature alone is worth the upgrade from the K10D.  Hot pixels (even the \"moving hot pixels\" that DPR's review complain about) are cured by running this so you don't have to send it back to the factory to do it.Dust removal lets you find and clear off dust before you end up shooting a big sequence of pictures only to find that you have to PP out a big blob in the upper right hand corner.The PC sync port is a screwlock PC sync port that is robust enough to handle a lot of usage in the studio; it's also weathersealed and can survive a high voltage flash.Liveview is useful (though not as well implemented as Canon's which has contrast AF) for the shots when you don't want to stick your head against the ground and get all muddy.Lens microadjustments (though you can't calibrate zooms at different focal lengths) works great on prime/limited lenses.It's a very refined, bang for buck DSLR and it's a shame more stores don't carry this so people can see how good it really is :-PThanks to Amazon for carrying it and having a great x-mas deal on it.", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Jennifer Gandert \"Red Tango\"", "ReviewID": "R32JRV3969C7YF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't purchase my Pentax K20D at Amazon but I can tell you that this reduced price is amazing.

One thing to note though is that while it comes with an AC cord, it is not an AC adapter to power the camera. The AC cord it comes with is for the battery charger. If you want to power the directly from AC you must buy the AC adapter. Neither Pentax or Amazon are clear about this detail. The AC adapter is about $100 extra. Most people will not need it.

But I really wanted the LiveView mode and the higher resolution of the K20D. I was disappointed with LiveView though. It is mostly useless. It is nothing like a typical LiveView on most new compact digital cameras. On the K20D, you flip a lever to activate it, at which point auto-focus no longer works (without pressing the AF button and waiting several seconds while the screen goes black and it refocuses... on \"something\"). You can manually focus, but that can be a challenge based on the LiveView screen, especially in bright light (and the viewfinder is blank when LiveView is active). After taking a shot, there is a several second \"blackout\" period where the screen goes black. This is the #1 annoyance in my opinion, and it's the main reason I never use it. You can continue shooting while it's black, but you won't really know what you're shooting. So my use of LiveView is limited to the occasional self-portrait shot where I need to set the camera on the ground. It is sometimes \"slightly\" useful to frame a shot in that situation. (A flip-out screen would make it much more useful.) So aside from my complaints about LiveView, I do love everything else about this camera. The higher resolution and better quality image sensor is definitely an improvement over the K10D. At the highest resolution, pictures are much larger, of course. (I shoot in RAW, so I bought a 16GB SDHC card, which holds about 600 RAW images.) There are a few other \"cool\" new features (like a 21 fps low-res shooting mode), but I really haven't found any practical use for them. The picture processing engine on this K20D is faster than the K10D. In summary, if you want the higher resolution, buy the K20D. If 10MP is enough for you and you don't care about novelty features, buy the K10D. But you will be happy with either of these great new Pentax cameras.

Putting a less than superb lens on a camera of this quality is akin to putting cheap gas in Ferrari.  Although Pentax justifiably emphasize that you can use any Pentax lens with its DSLRs, the ideal lenses are the latest generation, designed specifically for this size sensor.

On the other hand many other capabilities keep surprising me.

[Let me note that \"point & shoot\" is also an option with this camera, but I usually use the manual modes except when shooting outdoor scenery.] Part of my positive reaction is probably also due to the excellent 18-250 mm ~14x zoom lens that I bought with the camera. This lens takes you all the way from moderate wide angle to long telephoto. This camera does not use a full 35 mm detector but uses a \"C type\" cmos processor which is approximately 25 x 16 mm and all lens focal lengths should be multiplied by 1.5x to determine the 35 mm equivalent, therefore this lens, combined with this camera, produces an effective focal length of 27-375 mm. The positive of this is that the resulting lenses can be MUCH smaller than for a full 35 mm SLR. One of the really pleasing characteristics is the ability of this camera to take high quality images at high equivalent asa ratings up to 800 asa and with tolerable noise levels at even 1600 or, in a pinch, 3200 asa.

At 400 ISO and below it takes amazingly detailed pictures without any visable noise even if photos are cropped. The learning curve to use the custom functions is a bit steep, however. It comes with a thick manual and I'm still learning all the functions. I already had a lot of 35mm pentax lenses and its compatiblity with my existing lenses are the main reason I chose this camera over another make. It works great with A series lenses with the lense set to the Auto setting. When the lense apeture ring is set to a F-stop setting manually or if you are using an older lense without the Auto setting, you have to go into the camera's custom setting program and enable the camera for use with the apeture ring set manually for the camera to function. As far as I can tell, when the camera is operated with a m lense the apeture is not stopped down when you take a picture- you have to shoot these lenses wide open. The camera's exposue info indicated when I took a photo of a landscape scene at ISO 200 with my 17mm tokina lense apeture set to F16 that the scene was exposed with a shutter speed of 1/4000 second which should have been way underexposed but the photo appears normal with the normal depth of field you'd expect from this small an apeture. The camera's live view and optical preview modes won't function when I have an M series lense mounted on the camera either. These are minor inconvienances though as the camera's function with A series and later lenses are flawless.

One of the reason I decided on choosing Pentax k20D over other brand is its good reviews everywhere online and the affordable price.  I have never touch a Pentax DSLR before I place the order on Amazon and not even sure where this thing was made (I would like to take the chance to confirm here it was made in Philipine), that explained I have a lot of faith and trust on all the reviews I have read online, and thank you all, the k20D indeed is a great camera.  Due to my past experience with Pentax and being an avid photographer, I find the menu came with the camera quite informing and easy to read.  So far I only have less than 50 shots with the k20D and I shouldn't comment too much on the quality of the pictures this camera produced because I pair it with an old standard Pentax 50mm 1:1.4 lens.  So far with manual setting the picture quality is very good (outdoor and indoor w/o flash).  I took one of the reviewer's advice to set NR to low, and not even care for the camera's default setting.  I also pair the k20D with an old zoom Albinar 85-205 zoom lens, the picture outcome was a joke!  I tried the Albinar's Macro feature outdoor, to my amaze it was quite good!  So I guess I just have to take another reviewer's advice to buy the top-of-the-line Pentax DA* 50-135mm lens to pair with the k20D.  I don't have the money yet, I'll definitely buy one when my tax return arrive.One thing I have to comment on the shipping time from Amazon.  I placed the order of k20D (direct from Amazon) on 3/25 along with the Battery Grip (from Amazon MarketPlace), the Grip arrived way before the camera.  The camera was shipped on 3/30 (took Amazon 5 days to get the order ready!) and arrived at my house on 4/6 by UPS (12 days total).  I had to skip work and wait at home all day for the package, the package arrived at 6:30PM on that day, what a pity!  Yes, it's good to have a day off, but in this recession, I dare not pissing the boss off!PS.

The only problem at the safari was that people looked at me with a \"You are scaring the animals with the noise\" look in their eyes. It has a really noisy shutter that I do not like at all. Still it did take some really great shots. The camera also feels solid and has a great construction. It can go up to 1.5 kilos with my telephoto, which by the way is an awesome as it goes from 18-250. The wide angle is so fabulous that it also looks good in addition to being good! After a lot of transportation between countries, for some reason, my battery grip has stopped working after 2 years. Would I buy a Pentax again? Well, it depends. I'll keep my lenses and probably sell the camera soon because in the next two years or so, Pentax may get out a camera that has a less noisy shutter and vastly improve on other areas. This is important to me as I take a lot of shots in the wild. Or I may just keep it and also get a full frame Canon for the wildlife stuff. I like the Pentax body much better than the Canon body as it has a beautifully solid feel to it and sits nicely in your hands. I found the canon body a bit effeminate.On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it 8 if you are a person who is not a professional photographer but an amateur enthusiast. Pentax has always prided itself as a great camera for beginners as they have a short learning curve with its simplicity of design and in that sense, they really do deliver. If you are thinking of specializing in things that involve fast movement such as a bird taking flight from a branch or something moving quickly, I'd look elsewhere as this falls short in this area.

Found the build quality to be top-notch, feels solid in the hands.  This camera has been very ez to work with and the learning curve has not been to steep. The pictures are beautiful and sharp, have a few that I have had printed out at 24\"X30\" and they look great. The 18-55 Pentax lens it top notch for a kit lens, very sharp, focuses very well even in low light plus you can always tweak the focus manually.  The D-LI50 battery is amazing. 500 shots ez if you use the flash some, 1000 if you don't do a lot of flash.  I can't say enough about this camera.  Oh... and low light performance is good too, compared to every camera out there. Want less noise, turn the settings up, and all of the reviews have been done with factory default which is NR off.Now the badThere are 3 sets of people this camera is not for.1st.  If you like to do a lot of long exposures over 5 min (star gazers).  The way the sensor is set up, any exposure over 1 sec or so, the camera hot pixle hunts for a time equal to the exposure time. If you take a 5-minute exposure the camera exposes the sensor for 5 min then closes and hot pixel hunts for another 5 min, effectively locking out the camera for 10 minutes total.  This can put a cramp on the number of shots you can take, especially if you like doing 1-hour exposures.2nd. PROFESSIONAL SPORTS.  It's not that you can't take good action shots with this camera, you can. (I have great air show pics from my K1000 film, stopped dead) but the frames per second are too slow for someone making a living at it. You will also spend $1500-$2500 USD more. For having fun with the kid's games or any other than that, you want to get paid for shooting it's fine.  Just try to anticipate your shots the way you would a film camera and you will be fine.3rd.  Sadly, if you're the type that likes to run down to the corner camera shop and pick up the latest lens flash or other PENTAX SPECIFIC item FORGET IT.  The new owners of Pentax have pretty much dumped all of their smaller retailers so they're not carrying the cameras and lenses. I live in the Dallas area and have been to most of the shops here and I have heard the same story from every one of them. Their reps are gone and they don't do the volume needed to keep the cameras and be competitive.  So for the most part, lenses and flashes will have to be gotten on line.  Anything not body specific (filters) your fine.Tamron 70-300mm: This lens came with this bundle. For the price, it's a nice lens with one major flaw, PURPLE FRINGE.  If you have the lens wide open and at full mag, its pretty bad and depending on what your shooting it will be impossible to get rid of post process.  Keep it at f8 and around 250mm and it does a great job.  For a budget zoom, its not bad.  Just remember budget. ***SPARE Battery: D-LI50 battery. This bundle comes from Cameta Camera and the spare battery they are sending is an NP-400. Compared to the D-LI50 it's about 1/3rd to1/2 weaker.  As soon as I saw it was not what they stated in the ad.  I emailed them and asked about it, thinking it was a mistake.  I received this response:\" Hi,Thanks for contacting us. The battery that you received is the replacement battery for the DL-I50. This battery is made to replace 3 different batteries that are used in 3 different cameras, the Pentax as well. Using the battery will not void your warranty since it will work perfectly in your camera.If you do not want it than we can take it back for a purchase price refund through Amazon.If you would please be so kind as to return the battery in its original packaging to the address listed on the top of your invoice, marked to the attention of the \"Returns Department,\" I would be most appreciative.

I happened to do a search of that online retailer + \"scam\" and found they are one of the many \"bait and switch\" dealers out there. So I cancelled that order immediately and returned to amazon.com for the purchase. When it came time to check out, the camera/lens set was maybe a hundred dollars more than the other place, but besides the free shipping, I also was offered $200 in bonus promos (including a 12 megapixel Pentax point and shoot and a camera bag!), and was confident in knowing I wasn't dealing with sharks. The camera(s) arrived quickly and well packed, and so begins my digital adventure.....My advice is simple, shop and compare and get educated on the camera and lens you want, then buy from Amazon.com (or some similarly reputable source) with confidence.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "The newest used camera I could have possibly got!", "Author": "Liliana Ch De Costa \"Liliana\"", "ReviewID": "R1625WTTPO9RKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Annette Harris was very helpful shipping the camera on time and writing giving her personal recommendations about the camera.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera", "Author": "Photog", "ReviewID": "R2AH5HXO8QECVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic image quality and full spec. with in-body-stabilation, weather proof, focus correction for lenses etc.Looking forward to having a FF Pentax!", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very Impressed", "Author": "V.

An under-rated but super machine, which I still own.After reading some reviews of the K20D I wanted to try one out. Although I live near Baltimore, upper quality cameras by Pentax are difficult to find.Trying to locate the best price from a dealer with good reputation, I discovered Amazon.There are many things about the K20 I like and some things I wish were different.The menu is repetitive. and the instruction booklet like a King novel. I don't care for the LCD, but can't say why exactly. It should have a higher shutter speed than 1/4000th and the processsor could be 14 bit as opposed to 12 bit.It has a great \"feel\" in one's hand and this is improved by the grip. Looking over how the camera is made brings confidence, in the same way the LX did. Any lens with the p/k mount will work. The in camera processing is to be commended as well.The lens system for Pentax has never seemed as extensive as others, but the quality for the better lenes is there and why have so many choices that are close to each other. How many does one truly need or can carry.Speaking to dealers about Pentax, most caused me to feel like a renegade for not choosing Canon or Nikon.
