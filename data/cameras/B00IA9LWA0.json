Boss", "ReviewID": "R36ZSM1PJMXAU1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update: Oh No, 5 days left on the Amazon return window and I got a \"Lens Error\" message on my screen.  Could I be on camera #3 in one month?First week of ownership; I'm on camera #2.  The flash on my first camera \"needed help\" to pop-up (Nikon Service confirmed this was not normal).  Thanks Amazon for the fast replacement!600 pictures on both cameras (300 each) and I'm very happy with its performance.  My reference point for \"performance\" means reliable, crisp, focused picture(s) on a consistent basis (ie. not blurry) while in maximum resolution, minimal zoom, usually during a rushed \"point and shoot\" scenario.  This is my 3rd Nikon (S8000; $200 and S3300; $100).  The S9700 is an upward progression from the S8000 (I was very happy with), whereas I'll use my smartphone to take pictures before I ever drop $100 for an entry level camera (S3300) again.PRO's (in order of my needs)Easy viewing monitor in bright daylight (except with polarized sunglasses for horizontal/landscape pictures; vertical/portrait OK)High Resolution (MegaPixels) at $300 price pointFast focus to get all 9 \"focus boxes\" to appear for a crisp pictureMacro pictures are great as long as you don't need the flash (lens shadow)Non-detachable lens (pro/con) - many venues I attend specify no \"professional photography\" ie. camera's with a detachable lens.WiFi is convenient to download photo's to your smartphone (to email/text) as well as use as a camera remote control with zoom (instead of just the self timer)Fast transfer of photo's out of the camera via its usb port- Natural progression from the S8000- Ton's of manual manipulation options (compared to S8000)- Takes the same battery as the S8000, so I can share the batteries between the 2 cameras.Con's- That flash is going to break (again), it's a matter of \"when\".  It's made of plastic and has more pivot points than a bi-fold door (see my pictures).- $6 Nikon Extended Service Coverage (ESC) Nikon 2-Year Extended Service Coverage (ESC) for Nikon Coolpix Digital Cameras I consider this a must if you plan to own your camera beyond 1 year.  Nikon stopped selling service parts to independent dealers.  I had a great experience with Nikon service (repair of my S8000) and feel it worth the investment.Recommendation?  If you have a S8000 and looking to upgrade, then this would be a good camera for you.  1. You have the experience to keep your fingers out of the way of flash.  2. You already know the PCB (circuit board) inside will break at 2 years so you know you need that ESC.  3. The new controls/options will open a new world of photography to you without diving into the d-SLR world (not a substitute to the d-SLR world by any means).I wouldn't recommend this to someone new to digital cameras, or new to Nikon.  It's not an entry level camera.  I get the feeling that most people have no idea how to get the 9 green focus boxes, or what they mean.  I've learned to not hand my camera to someone else expecting a good picture.I have never owned a digital camera that didn't break.  That's why with my S8000, I bought the ESC for $2.  Canon (repaired within warranty), Olympus (repaired within warranty), Nikon (returned S3300, and S8000 repaired in extended warranty).I'm not thrilled with the S9700 flash mechanism, but all it's competitor's (DSC-RX100, XZ-2, PowerShot SX600) seem to have gone the same direction.  Time will tell.For what it's worth, if you like soft neoprene cases, I do recommend the FlexArmor case FlexARMOR Compact Digital Camera Case with Carrying Carabiner for Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 II , HX200V , DSC-HX50V , DSC-WX50 and Many More Sony Point and Shoot Digital Cameras.  It holds the camera, 1 extra battery and extra SD cards perfectly.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Compact beauty", "Author": "Omnium Nihil", "ReviewID": "R3QXUFX7X27DRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to take a stable electronic zoom at 1500 mm in bright sunlight. Most impressive. I had been considering a bridge or full DSLR before I select this. The aperture /shutter priority with full manual control is impressive and works very well. I have yet to use much of the special settings as the traditional control is so good. I do regret that the aperture cannot be stopped down to a1.8 much less1.4, but this is my travel camera and it will likely be with me where a bulky DSLR wouldn't (I know, because even  before film became scarce I rarely took my canon AE1P and associated lenses but often took my canon SD550 and before that a Chinon digital compact and before that a Minolta film compact). One problem was trying to connect to my iDevices by Wi-Fi. Nikon service couldn't fix it. However, I found that by sending an internet message from the iDevice to the camera in the http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format while the camera was searching for a connection and then clicking on the \"take photos\" button in the Nikon app fixed the problem. The camera URL (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx in which they x's are replaced by the appropriate numbers) is listed in one of the sub menus. One big concerns was whether the OLED screen would be bright enough to see on a sunny Louisiana day. It's not perfect, but way better than an iDevice and almost the same quality as a kindle paper white but with colors bleached out to almost match the paper white with no dark letters/scene specifics. The wide angle to zoom is fantastic. I also find that  as long as I am aware of the flash settings, it's location is not a problem. However, the flash seems to want to pop up whenever I try to place the camera in its case or just touch the camera \"wrong\". The flash is thus way too sensitive. The battery compartment cover has been modified from earlier models and is very secure now. I did find out that using my iPhone to take pictures above the crowd at the concert and taking about a ten minute movie really depleted the battery.  ( I used three batteries for just185 pictures and the movie, but I was really going wild with the Wi-Fi ).  I fully expect 300 or so pictures can be taken per battery if the camera is used as a regular camera, just haven't tried that yet. Also using the phone to take pictures through the camera necessitated a lengthy wait while the photo downloaded. Overall though,  a very good product.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "1st week review", "Author": "Joe Fackelman", "ReviewID": "R26GZ895TFDTL4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just purchased this past week. I'm pleased to say that I'm not disappointed. I will say that I had a little bit of challenge figuring out the WIFI part. However, the trick that I found is to open the smartphone app after you turn on the WIFI settings on your phone, and selecting \"connect to smart device\" on the camera. Pics transferred VERY quickly.I really like how fast the camera is at starting up. That's a big feature in my opinion. Many potential shots can be lost while waiting for the camera to turn on.The only thing I wish I could find or have is an external polarizer filter when shooting outdoors during the day. I know you can touch up photos via computer/photo editing apps. Just like to do it in real time.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "great pictures", "Author": "C. Edmunds Rhoad", "ReviewID": "RS23WZGGM4PDU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought it on line so I was a little taken back by its size.  I was looking for a pocket camera.  With that said, it is just fine.  The pictures are outstanding and superior to a pocket camera.  I bought it for the GPS and WiFi capabilities.  GPS is very good, but it drains the battery so a second battery of back up is a necessity.  The WiFi is disappointing as it only transfers pictures to my iPhone and not to my iPad.  In addition it requires its own free software to do so.  So it is a two step process to get the photos into iPhoto, and then it transfers them to Photo Stream and not to Camera Roll.I have a little concern with the pop up flash and the lens cover so I use a camera bag and do not put it in my pocket unprotectedThey say that the best camera is the one in your pocket so that is my iPhone.  However, the best one for quality, especially low light quality it this camera.  Great pictures, I recommend this camera and would buy it again.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointing overall due to small sensor and high megapixel noise in images", "Author": "Brad Hutchinson", "ReviewID": "R37RFXYYGZGUYT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this as a possible replacement for a Panasonic ZS25 along with an Olympus SH-1.  I ended up returning this camera.This camera started going downhill the second I turned it on.  There was an obvious speck of dust/dirt on the CCD sensor straight out of the box that was noticeable in every picture with a solid background.  This is a problem I have had with all the Panasonic travel zooms over the years but none of them were dusty straight out of the box like this Nikon.  I can only imagine how much dust will be on the sensor once this camera is used outdoors and would not trust this camera even if it had been excellent in all other ways.Price - Paid $319.  Price is decent considering it offers GPS, Wi-Fi, and a 30X optical zoom.Ergonomics - Somewhat heavy (233 grams/8.2 ounces including battery) and large for a point and shoot making one handed shooting difficult.  No real grip exists and the camera is slippery.  Has a poorly located pop up flash that is directly under where your left hand sits if doing two handed shooting.Build Quality - Mainly plastic.  When the camera is turned off the lens assembly wobbles around inside the camera with every move.  Dust inside the camera straight out of the box tells me it is not sealed very well.Notable features - Built in GPS and Wi-FiZoom Usability - While this camera has the longest zoom out of the three it is not usable to 30X.  Even in bright daylight the flash will deploy if zoomed in to 30X and photos come out dark.  Zoom gauge is confusing since no X number is shown (ie 20X, 24x).  Hand held shots are possible at full zoom but I recommend burst mode because most will be blurry.Image Quality -A. Daytime images are inconsistent; some are excellent others are horrible.B. Low light images have lots of noise.C. The flash is bright and night images look very good.D. The macro mode takes good close up pictures with nice detail.E. Has the best autofocus of the three with numerous areas of focus showing up on the LCD screen.Overall some images come out looking really good and others are very noisy.  The 30X zoom is unusable because the f/ is too dark.  Night images with flash are great but the Panasonic ZS15 remains my favorite compact travel zoom.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gets ZERO out of TEN for Point-n-shoot capability", "Author": "Gagan", "ReviewID": "R3IW87C3IALP0B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Edited on 18th may:I had to return the camera as on 15th day (last day to return), the LCD screen stopped working. What a bummer... I really liked 30x zoom.Original comment below.........I have a D-SLR with telescopic lense but wanted to replace my compact camera. I was impessed by this little compact camera with 30x zoom and features. I took it to a trip to Hawaii and here is my review after extensive use (over 200 pictures)...The good:-Compact and 30x zoom that works very well (use tripod)-awesome features that allow many ways to tone brightness, color, background exposure, depth blah blah-excellent video HD qualitythe Bad-You adjust focus and get ready to shoot... just as you click you will notice the subject gets hazy and you get a horrible picture. Two weeks later i am still to figure why.-Poor grip (zoom lense and flash make it hard to grip)-Flash seems tacky and i am not sure how long it will last-This camera gets 0 out of 10 for \"point and shoot capability\".-The picture quality is extremely bad unless you are in perfect condition. To get good quality picture, you can spin dials but that is where it is your interpretation of 'photo quality'... it is not natural. Fr instance, Tiki torches look too orange and ocean looks too blue.So this is not a point and shoot camera, I am very disappointed.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pop up flash is noisy, jarring and surprising", "Author": "Sandra S.

I see no way to set the default flash to OFF.  Every time I turn the camera off and back on, it defaults to flash AUTO.  If there is no way to change the default to flash OFF, this camera goes back.  The flash is also exactly where your finger wants to go for a nice grip of the camera. Nice camera, REALLY WRETCHED pop up flash. The pop up flash froze in place several times, apparently due to placing a finger on the pop up flash opening.

The only way to shut it off is to take out the battery. THEN it also quit charging, or holding the charge, not sure which, but when it has the other problems, it's irrelevant. Glad to not have exteneded warranty, because it's too junky to spend one more cent to repair.  This peice of garbage is being returned to buy some other brand. Too bad it's ruining my ability to take pictures for what is a once in a lifetime trip.

The zoom is impressive; steady and sharp. The indoor/low light capability make this camera almost perfect for everything. Would have given this camera five stars except for the the flash constantly popping up even when the camera is off. After two months on one week long trip later, I sent the camera back for warranty repairs. Got the camera back today with a note the camera meets factory standards. Well their standards must be sub-par because I don't have much use for a camera with a flash that cant stay closed. Plus with this raised flash design, it will only be a matter of time before the flash gets ripped from the camera. That makes this camera a waste of $350. Anybody want to buy a slightly used but factory standard S9700? Going back to my S8100; that camera has never let me down. Avoid the S9700 unless you want an excuse to buy another camera weeks or months after you break your S9700. I've been a Nikon fan for years (5 Coolpix & 2 SLRs), but I think I'll try Canon's PowerShot SX700 since I really like the 30x zoom.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Low Light Flash Pictures!!!!", "Author": "Frances B.", "ReviewID": "RGD2U5AX5FSOF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for an easy to use point and shoot camera with a decent zoom and a camera that would take a good picture in low light! I found all that and more with my new Nikon S9700. The camera test was a bridal shower in a hall without a lot of light. I was thrilled to get bright clear pictures while using the zoom. I appreciate the manual settings when I didn't want to use the auto setting for quicker action shots! Extremely easy to use - very light and slim. I took 250 pictures and the battery was still fully charged. One little issue... the location of the auto pop up flash is poorly designed. The flash should be located in the middle of the camera not in the corner where most people hold their camera.

I found the camera to be slower in the ability to take more than one picture without a long wait and when shutting it off, it is very slow to close the lens.  If a flash was being used, I had a time remembering to not have my finger on top of the camera.  When done with the flash, I would have to manually close it. I would turn flash off but every time I went to take a picture, it would be back on.  Not good when your in place where flash is not aloud.  Pictures turned out o.k. but nothing spectacular.
