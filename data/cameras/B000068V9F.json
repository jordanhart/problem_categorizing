Finally I figured out that what I really wanted was:1)not to replace my normal camera so 2Mpixels would do just fine2)minimum 3x optical zoom (didn't care about digital)3)something small4)under $4005)movie mode with soundNow that I have the Sony P2 here are my likes and dislikes:Likes -1)it is one of the smaller cameras out there - great for travel2)I love the movie mode, which is only limited by the size of your memory stick3)I like the fact that you can turn off the digital zoom so that you don't accidentally use it4)The menu system is intuitive and easy to use5)The battery is much smaller than I expected - the camera is not heavy at all (yet still has a solid feel)6)You can plug the camera right into your TV to view the photos and movies7)You can easily change between NTSC and PAL video formats which will be great when I go back home to the UK for a visit8)Has automatic scene lighting for when you are in a dark place - works really well9)Rechargable battery holds quite a good life - easily enough for a full day's outingDislikes -1)You have to wait much longer between shots than with a conventional point and click camera (2-3sec maybe)2)I knew the 16Mb Memory Stick wasn't going to be nearly enough so I just ordered a 128Mb one with the camera (more money)3)I like having a rechargable battery, but the down side is if it runs out you've had it unless you carry a spare (which are small and light, but again - more money to spend)Bottom Line -I personally would buy this camera again.  It ended up being a little more than I really wanted to spend, once I added on extra memory and spare battery, but I haven't regretted it.  I am also contemplating getting a case for it to protect the viewing screen, but I don't think this is a requirement as long as you are careful.I didn't give this 5 stars because of the shot delay and the fact the you really need to buy extra memory.", "Date": "August 14, 2002"}, {"Title": "Worth its weight in gold!", "Author": "Eric Lozauskas", "ReviewID": "R2MKN2WQ32K10K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is magnificent.  I puchased this from BestBuy and have been loving it ever since!  Mine came with a 16 MB memory stick... A memory stick is the type of media that the camera uses to store the pictures.  Other cameras use media like compactflash, etc.  Memory sticks are definately the way to go however.  Most new sony products are starting to have memory stick readers (even the televisions/cable boxes!), so you can have picture/slide shows!  Its a great time to join the sony family.Now, about the camera... This camera is top notch!  Honestly, I love just about every feature this camera offers!  I ordered mine with the sony Cybershot starter kit which came with a really nice camera bag, a memory stick holder and an extra infolithium battery!The camera uses rechargable infolithium battery packs (which are light and tiny!!) and charge inside the camera!  Simply plug in the camera, and it charges...and MUCH quicker that the other clunkier sony's charge the standard batteries.  I do wish that they offered an external battery charger though, but perhaps they will in the future...The LCD display is fantastic in low light, bright light, sunlight, etc.  Camera is easy to operate, lasts long on each battery charge (at LEAST an hour being on...)  The quality is superb.  The side has a spring loaded door which has the battery and memory stick behind it.  If the door swings open by mistake (which hasn't happened to me yet), the battery is held in by a strong clip, and the memory stick is \"clicked\" into the slot.  Top notch design!  Even on the bottom, the tripod mount is metal unlike other cheap cameras with plastic mounts (which strip easily!)...I highly recommend you purchase this camera.  You will love it as a great point and shoot camera with enough options to have fun with (movies with sound, and camera effects!)  The 2 Megapixel resolution is perfect.  4x6's are crystal clear, and 8x10's look quite nice.  Sure you could get 3, 4, or even 5 megapixel cameras, but why waste the money and need larger media for all that extra space the pictures take when for normal printouts of 4x6, 2 megapixels works just fine?  Hopefully this review helps those of you who were sinking in a sea of camera choices like I was.  You won't regret purchasing this camera.  You'll fall in love the second you turn it on.", "Date": "November 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "Just get it!", "Author": "Parelle", "ReviewID": "R7PZX41YNG7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best investments that I've ever made.  The camara is TINY (it can fit in a purse, an acomplishment for any camara, much less a digital) and has wonderful picture quality.  The flash is unbelivable, particularly at night, althhough I do have problems taking pictures indoors with poor light.  I would recommend also getting a 128 MB memory stick, since I was able to take over 75 pictures (at 1280 x 980 res) before downloading them to my computer.  Overall, if you're looking for a camara not for artwork but for ordinary picture taking, this is the perfect choice.", "Date": "December 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R20B09X7JIZ4TH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got mine from bestbuy for about 300 bucks and I'm really satisfied with it, 2 megapixels are just enough to make a good quality photo without having to buy an aditional hard drive for all them pictures (if this is your first digicam trust me you gonna make hundrets of them). Its easy to use point and shoot camera but it still has quite few features and settings that will make that special shot just perfect. Its small metal body fits to any pocket so you can take it with you anywere. A biger memory stick is a must, trust me it will fill up fast.Not to long ago I also purchased an LCM-PX carying case which is also great, it's small, fits the cmera perfectly, you can ware it on your belt like a beeper or a celphone and when the oportunity comes you'll never miss that great shot. I cary mine every where I go, not only when I go on a trip.The two things that made me buy this purticular camera are: #1 it's made by SONY, In my life I owned many electronic gadgets and sory to say most of them had some kind of a defect or broke down after a regular use, not so with SONY products, I had them for longes time and they take on any kind of abuse I throw at them. #2 for a tiny camera like this SONY packs it with all kinds of features other cameras don't have like Super HAD CCD (an image sensor that makes a 2 megapixel camera seem more like a 4), or a AF Iluminator (helps out focusing in less them perfect liting conditions), and ofcours SONY has the best movie mode out there. So stop thinking about it and just get it, for your self or as a gift to others (trust me they won't be disapointed)", "Date": "November 13, 2002"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2VP91P2KSR1SL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always trusted Sony products and this camera is another example why.

I just got this camera a few days ago, and already it has surpassed my expectations!  The photo quality is GREAT, but I recommend using a flash whenever you are inside, otherwise the pictures get kind of dark.  Easy to use controls that are well explained in the manual.  Very compact size, fits perfectly into a pocket.  I do recommend getting a 128mb memory stick...TRUST ME with the way this camera performs you won't be able to stop taking pictures.  The only thing I would complain about is the price.  Not too bad, but a little on the ... side.  ALL IN ALL, A GREAT CAMERA!!  BUY IT NOW!!", "Date": "January 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Superb!

The camera works like magic. Crisp and clear pictures when taking pictures outdoors. Indoor pictures suffers a bit but the camera overcome this problem with the white balance and over exposure feature. When using the Night Scene feature,  recommend to use a tripod as the camera takes some time to capture the photo and any shaking will cause the photo to be distorted, unless you like artistic special lighting photos. There is also a quick review button, so you can check out if your shot is good. There are 3 types of Movie mode, first being the high resolution with sound, yes sound, mode. Second is the burst clip mode and third is the multi frame mode which allow you to take pictures of different scene, think of it like a moving GIF file that changes pictures. I had developed some of my photos into prints with Kodak, i must say the unedited prints are sharp. Of course you can always edit the photos on our computer before sending for printing. Being 2Mega pixle, there are some limitation to print size, maximum of 6R with 1600X1200 resolution as recommended by Kodak and Fujifilm.Overall this is a great camera and 1 of the other reason i bought this camera is that it comes with a marine pack, so you can bring the camera to all your underwater diving trips.", "Date": "January 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "Just got it...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2Q9J6WWRTGNNF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...and it rules.  It has everything I could ever want and more.  Everyone says you need more than the 16MB included memory, not me... it's just enough if you're able to upload the pics to your computer each time the card is full.  For this price, you got to get this camera... the picture quality is awesome.", "Date": "August 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Everything I could ever want.", "Author": "15 year old amateur photographer.", "ReviewID": "R15979O9PLBQAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the perfect camera for anyone who is just getting started in Digital Photography. It has two megapixels, which is plenty for me. Feel free to get more, but I have taken so many beautiful pictures with this camera when not even using Fine picture quality. The video mode is great. It is what really attracted me to this camera. It has audio and as much video can be taken as the memory card can hold, about 5 minutes on high quality, 20 minutes on medium, and 90 minutes on poor with my 128mb memory card. I suggest that you use medium quality so that you can still get fairly good videos, but conserve memory card space. You just have to remember that it is still a picture camera and not a video camera, so it will not be great quailty video. Now for the complaints. My first is that I can't figure out how to make auto flash come on when I start the camera. For some reason it always goes to no flash, so you have to remember to turn the flash on. The only other complaint is that the 16mb card is practically useless, so I went ahead and bought a 128mb card when I bought the camera. Depending on the different quality settings it can hold as many as 1700 pictures (640 x 480, standard quality) or as little as 120 pictures (1600 x 1200, fine quality). Generally speaking, I keep it on 1280 x 960 standard quality and I can get around 400 pictures. Finally, the USB connection is great. You just hook the camera up to the computer, install the drivers if you have an older version of Windows than XP (I didn't have to install any divers on my computer with XP), and turn on the camera. The computer detects it as an extra drive, just like a ZIP drive.

I got one as a gift for my family first and had to get another one for myself. It got all the feature you want, both closely zoom and wide angle. Battery life lasts reasonably long. I can go for a day trip without recharging. Memory card is definitly too small. Recommend buy extra.
