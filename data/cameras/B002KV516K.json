{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Holds only 15 photos - 'nuf said.", "Author": "Joshua McNichols \"Joshua McNichols\"", "ReviewID": "R2HXY7LLPD8Z0G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Unfortunately, the onboard memory accommodates only 15 photos (no expansion card is available). To make things worse, the batteries constantly run out - it seems we replace them every time we use the camera. The video feature is a joke - a few seconds is all the memory this camera has room for. And since removing the batteries wipes out the onboard memory, that means constantly tethering the camera to the computer to offload its meager haul of photos. Oh, and Windows 7 does not recognize the camera, only Vista and XP.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Vivitar VS28B 2.1MP Digital Camera - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pjLWrrt3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002KV516K"}}
