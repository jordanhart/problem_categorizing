{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wow, what a camera!", "Author": "Rolla Gravett \"Rolla Gravett\"", "ReviewID": "RTNYP0Q4ESKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is everything the FZ100 is and they fixed all the shortcomings to produce the FZ150. The buttons in the back of the 100 were too easy to push.  I was constantly pushing the playback button when holding the camera with one hand.  No more.  The button is recessed and the problem is gone.  Most if not all the accessories that work on the 100 also work on the 150.  Aftermarket batteries actually show capacity now!When focusing, when the camera focuses it beeps now so you don't have to be looking at the screen.  That is great for using Red Dot Sights on this camera.  Night shots are awesome with the Handheld Night Shots Mode.  It takes several pictures and combines them for great shots with no blur.  The camera has way less noise then the FZ100.  Even at ISO 1600 and ISO 3200 the noise is better than the FZ100 was in ISO 400.  Camera focus in the picture mode and in the video mode is much faster.  You can take 12 frames per second burst inside now at all ISO's.  The 100 will not do that.The camera works great in iA (intelligent auto) were the FZ100 was real noisy in that mode.  The camera will zoom to 62.4X in the 3mp picture mode with I-Zoom turned on.  I like setting the camera at 8mp picture size, which gives me 39.1X zoom. It records in 1080P video!The flash works great!  It goes out over 30 feet and lights up the rooms very well.  I will post some pictures of that.  Pictures are very sharp, not noisy, and crisp.This camera is everything that the FZ100 is and much more.  This camera is a REAL WINNER!  Great job Panasonic!I just went outside and put the camera in the 12 frames per second mode, shot 12 shots, waited 1 second, shot another 8 shots, waited another second, shot another 8 shots.Someone mentioned the Canon SX40IS, so I checked it out.  The cameras are similar in a lot of ways.  Each one has it's strengths and weaknesses.  The killer for me is the burst mode.  The Canon will shoot at 10 frames per second for 8 shots.  The Panasonic will shoot at 12 frames per second for 12 shots.  Not that much different there.  The part they don't tell you is the Panasonic after taking the 12 shots, wait 1 second, you can take another 8 shots, wait one second, another 8 shots.  In the 5.5 fps burst it will go 30-35 shots before slowing down.  The Canon will not do that. At 5.5 fps in Auto Focus the camera will go 30 to 35 shots and focus between each shot.  In the Canon the rate of burst in Auto Focus is .8 fps.  Yes, .8 frames per second.  Less than 1 frame per second and focus in between shots.  That in my opinion is a deal killer.  That is exactly why I chose the Panasonic FZ100 over the Canon SX30IS.  It is just too slow for any kind of action shots.I was at an Animal Safari this last Sunday and had a problem with the camera focusing on the bars of the cage instead of the animal. Sometimes it focused on the animal and sometimes it would not.  Finally I used the button on the left side of the lens.  It is a ZOOM/FOCUS button, and to change it to a zoom, go to Menu Set, Setup Menu, Page 2, the third one down (Side Lever) and change it to ZOOM or to FOCUS.  I changed it to FOCUS and put the focus lever in manual focus.  From that point on I had no trouble focusing the bars out of the picture.  This camera is awesome!Another thing that happened to me is I was inside a display area.  It was dark inside.  All the displays were encased in glass so flash was out of the question.  I was in Aperture Priority and for some reason the pictures kept coming out too bright.  I changed the Aperture, no help.  Then I put the main dial in iA (intelligent auto) and took a picture.  It came out perfect!  The FZ100 was always a problem in iA, usually because of the noise.  Not this camera!  It gets it perfect every time.  If you are a novice and don't want to mess with camera controls, this is the camera for you.  Anyone can shoot it and get great pictures as long as they can frame a shot and push the shutter release button!  If you want to take full control, fine, the camera will do that too.  This camera is great for the novice and the experienced photographers!  Panasonic got it right this time!I have noticed that my camera tends to be towards the warm side in color temperature in Auto White Balance.  That is totally adjustable and it is explained on pages 114 and 115 of the manual.I am listing this and guarantee it will get someone. If you try to take a picture with the flash and it will not go off, the flash is open and it is dark enough for it to go off and it does not....... Your camera is in the Burst Mode!!!! That gets lots of people all the time.Part of the picture on playback is flashing in black and white.... Your HIGHLIGHT is turned on and the picture is saturated in the black and white saturated area.To turn it off go to the SETUP menu, page 3 at the bottom.Did you know that you can take a snapshot or a burst of pictures while taking video? This camera will do that. The picture size is 3.5mp. You can record up to 40 pictures per video. Look in the manual on page 38.You shot a really cool video and want a snapshot from it. Simply play the video back in the camera in the play mode, and pause the video where you want the shot, press Menu Set, it asks SAVE THIS IMAGE? Highlight YES and press Menu Set! Done. You have saved a picture from the video that you took. I can't seem to find that in the manual but am still looking. It works just the same. I think the picture size is 2.5mp, but can't find it in the manual.The camera has a live Histogram so you can see the picture readout before you shoot it.  Go to Menu Set, SETUP, Page 3, second one down.  To move from one page to the next, simply pull the zoom lever to the right.  To go down move the zoom lever to the left.The camera will take 5 flash shots in quick succession.  To do that, go to SCN on the main dial, go to the second row, the forth one down.  Pick your picture size and press Menu Set.  It will now take 5 quick flash pictures by holding the shutter release button down. Make sure you open the flash.The camera will take 220 frames per second in the video mode.  To do that go to SCN again and go to the second page and it is the middle icon.  HSIf I was using any of the priority modes at night (I would use iA in this camera) go to Menu Set and the REC mode, on the first page under PHOTO STYLE, I would use Natural as it is more sensitive to light.  It may be a moot point as iA (Intelligent Auto) is better for low light.This camera works really well all the way to ISO 1600 in low light areas.  ISO 3200 works too, but is more noisy.I have the Vivitar DF-383 flash that I use on this camera.  It is a very powerful flash and is much cheaper than the Panasonic Flash.  It is not quite as powerful as the top of the line Panasonic Flash but half the price.  Make sure you get the Vivitar DF-383 flash for Panasonic.DF-383 Power Zoom AF Flash for PanasonicI would get a remote shutter or a interval timer for this camera.  The camera has to be powered to use for time lapse photography and an interval timer, but if you push the EVF (Electronic View Finder) button to shut down the LCD, the drain on the battery is minimal.  I took a 3 hour time lapse video this way and the battery showed 1 mark down from full charge at the end.Aftermarket batteries now show capacity in this camera.  They are much cheaper than Panasonic batteries even though the Panasonic batteries seem to be dropping in price.An external mike can be used on the camera, but be advised it takes a 2.5mm plug instead of the 3.5mm plug that normally comes on external mikes.  Amazon sells an adapter for cheap that will adapt the plug.  Rhode Mikes work on this camera.Teleconverters work well on the FZ150. There are 5 main ones that work well.  Don't waste your money and buy the cheap 2X and larger teleconverters.  Two of them are Olympus Lenses.  They are the TCON-17 (1.7X  with no letters behind the number.  It looks like a pear.), and the B300.  The Olympus lenses are no longer made and can be found on Ebay.  Nikon makes the TC-E15ED (1.5X).Panasonic makes a 1.7X lens as well.  <...>,  The last lens is a Raynox DCR-2025 Pro (2.2X).This camera has excellent stabilization and I am able to shoot at 39.1X (8mp picture size with I-Zoom turned on) without blurry photos during the day with no problems.This is my opinion and others may disagree.  Don't connect the camera to the computer and risk damaging it. Pull your SDHC card out of the camera (it takes a whole 1/10 second to pull your card out of the camera, just open the door and push on it) and put it into the computer if your computer has a SDHC card reader. The software supplied with the camera will know you put the card into a reader and it will prompt you to download the files, both video and photo. If your computer doesn't have a SDHC card reader, buy a good inexpensive USB card reader. They are only around $15 or so. It is much faster and safer and less hassle to pull your card out of the camera to download the files. Just do it.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A winner!", "Author": "Oldanalyst", "ReviewID": "R1G8XZWCIPLKLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For many years, I used SLR cameras and purchased a DSLR a few years back. I finally realized that some super-zoom cameras were on the market that would take pictures good enough for everything I did and would not require me to carry around multiple lenses. I bought a Panasonic FZ35 and was quite pleased with it. It turned out to be one of the better super-zooms ever made. My complaint was that I would like a longer zoom. I decided to try out another Panasonic camera but was put off by the tepid reviews of the FZ100.Since the FZ150 had not yet been released and there were only a few reviews of the camera, I purchased the highly praised Sony HX100V even though it lacked some features I would like to have. I was pleased with the pictures it took - up to a point. Thanks to a generous return policy of Amazon, I returned the HX100 and bought a Panasonic FZ150 which was the right move for me. I reviewed the Sony camera and you can read it elsewhere but this is a review of the Panasonic FZ150.While the zoom of this camera is not as great as some competitors, the intelligent zoom makes up for this. I was able to take high quality pictures of distant objects under a variety of lighting conditions using high zoom and generally hand holding the camera. Impressive! The FZ35 did a good job of keeping noise low up to about ISO 400. The FZ150 does the same but up to ISO 800. Even ISO 1600 shows low noise. I was able to read license plates from 3-400 feet away even in low light. I suspect that Panasonic has found the 12 MP resolution using a small sensor is a sweet spot and allows good noise reduction even at high ISO.I was able to take excellent closeups, the wide angle works well with minimal distortion and you can choose to record in RAW for better control in post production. And all of this works rapidly and reliably. The image stabilizer worked well in all but extreme closeups.To test both the video and burst modes, I stood near a train track and took pictures of oncoming and leaving trains. The burst mode is outstanding and the video is as good as can be expected from a super-zoom. The sound is excellent although in a quiet situation, you can hear the zoom being changed during recording. I like being able to choose AVCHD or MP4 for video recording. This gives you some control over video size, video quality and easy of use by various operating systems.The Sony has a panoramic mode while the FZ150 has a panoramic assist mode. With the assist, you can fairly easily set up successive pictures for merging using software. I found this assist allows you to control the resolution of a panorama better then when the camera creates the panorama. This is not a big deal since I mainly use this type of assist to merge 2 pictures rather than merge 5 or 6 shots and the software merge is fast.I was impressed by how well the FZ150 handled white balance. Outside, the automatic worked flawlessly. But this was also true indoors. I watched the camera readjust the white balance as I moved it between scenes illuminated by different light sources. This produced shots with correct color balance. With the FZ35, I had to manually switch white balance to maintain correct color rendition.A couple of other super-zooms do not have lenses with threads for filters. I was pleased to be able to use a UV filter (mainly to prevent lens scratching while walking through the woods) and use a polarizing lens as needed. I noticed that there are additional lens modifications available that fit the threads.Unfortunately, printing a full manual appears not to be in the cards any more. The manuals, both basic and advanced, are available in PDF format which allows you to print off sections as needed. But I still would like a printed manual provided by the manufacturer.The articulated viewing screen has good resolution although not as high as some competitors. I very much like being able to turn the screen over and close it. This protects the surface of the screen. You can use the EVF viewfinder which I like to use but did find myself using the LCD screen whenever I could.The FZ50 apparently requires a coded battery in order to see the amount of charge remaining in the camera viewer. I bought a non-Panasonic extra battery for the FZ150 and find that the amount of charge is shown in the viewer. This is a $ saver since non-Panasonic batteries cost less than those from Panasonic.I have used most every mode on the camera and find them all to do exactly what they are supposed to do. In summary, I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to buy a super-zoom. You can use automatic features if you are a neophyte or use the variety of settings if you are a knowledgeable enthusiast. In both cases, you will be pleased.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great features, great lens, less than stellar engineering", "Author": "rjw", "ReviewID": "R8OYPPU274B8W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I researched this purchase for several months, watching videos made by others using the camera, and pictures taken. I was very impressed with the video quality and picture quality from my research. It also had all the features I wanted (RAW shooting, flip-out LCD screen, a relatively decent \"superzoom\" lens and small size). I was aware of complaints of build quality, and the user interface, but I wasn't as concerned about that as with the features for the price.After using the camera for a few months, I have several things to mention.1.) The HD video quality is top-notch. Very impressive. I love the camera's ability to zoom and refocus while capturing movies. It makes my shots seem more \"cinematic\".2.) The photo quality is also excellent, pleasantly saturated colors (adjustable), although a bit grainy at the higher ISOs (not surprising given the camera's sensor size)3.) The build quality is indeed less than stellar. It seems a little more \"plasticky\" than it's competitors. This probably adds to the camera's light weight (which I do like), but when I use it, I feel like I have to be more careful than with other simlar camera's I've handled. Consequently, I carry it in a well-padded bag.4.) The interface is a bit confusing and overly complicated. Panasonic should take a lesson from Canon on interface design.5.) The buttons are a little small and tightly arranged. Although I've gotten used to it, it does make using the camera feel a little cramped - not a huge issue.6.) In at least one instance, the EXIF data indicated the flash did not fire, when in fact it did.7.) This is perhaps the most troubling issue (a glaring design flaw, in my opinion), and the main reason for not giving this product a full five star rating - In some pictures using the flash, white disks or \"soap bubbles\" (as the camera's manual calls them) appear superimposed over the subject. This phenomenon is mentioned in the PDF manual on page 197 (you can download a PDF of this Manual from Panasonic's website and read it yourself). I did read the PDF manual all the way through before buying the camera but I did not expect those artifacts to be so common (the shot in the manual showing the artifacts is not a picture style I typically shoot). The manual says they \"may appear as a result of the flash reflecting off of dust particles in the air\". To me, this is a major design flaw and has already ruined a number of my shots. I have never seen such artifacts from any cameras with on-board flash. At times the artifacts are subtle enough to where you don't see them until you download the pictures from the memory card to your computer and examine them - too late to re-shoot the photo without the flash. Of course, I have never seen the problem in video clips, but I have never used a video light source with the camera so I can't say if they wouldn't appear in that case.I am hopeful a firmware update will fix the EXIF and \"soap bubbles\" problems. If so, this would be a five-star product, in my opinion. In the mean time, I have created my own \"DIY\" flash diffuser for the pop-up flash that will hopefully eliminate or lessen the problem. If I can post a follow-up review, I will report the results of the change.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exceeded Expectations!!", "Author": "April H. Little", "ReviewID": "R2E7CSRPVF2Q81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After trying out the new Lumix G3 to replace my FZ30, I was sorely disappointed. The sample images I viewed on dpreview.com were excellent, but the pictures I took were horrible. That's because they were using super expensive lenses. Hmm....The kit lens was useless and I wasn't wanting to spend lots of money on more lenses. I also missed the zoom capability....enter the new Lumix FZ150. This looked more like the camera I have been using since 2005 (the FZ30), just totally upgraded.Right out of the box, I was not disappointed. The FZ150 is smaller than my FZ30, yet still feels very comfortable and secure in the hand. All the buttons seem to be in the right place. (The G3 was not designed well and I kept hitting a button I didn't want to press when I held the camera.)The FZ150 also takes great, natural-looking pictures indoors (which was what I was looking for) without a flash. It also takes wonderful macro images, which the G3 had a very difficult time doing. The G3 wouldn't even TAKE the picture if it wasn't in focus. The FZ150 focuses quickly and accurately.The video looks great, as well. The only drawback is the format of MP4. It does not import in Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0 without first being converted to an avi or mov file, but that seems to be the trend in all newer cameras, so I won't fault the FZ150 there.All in all, I am very, very pleased with this camera and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants to take great pictures without the bulk and expense of a DSLR.UPDATE: I took this camera to an event this weekend and it performed almost FLAWLESSLY!! Out of hundreds of pictures only a few were deleted! Also took lots of video (in MPEG4). As a heads up, the video did have a jerky playback on the computer until I converted it to an avi.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Take sports pictures like a pro with this gem!", "Author": "Marine88", "ReviewID": "R25R3IKOVAH91K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that my knowledge of cameras is very limited and I am as \"newbie\" as they come regarding photography.  My son was going to be playing in a national lacrosse tourney in Florida (We are from the midwest) and I wanted to purchase a camera that would let me capture all the action.  I was looking for zoom, burst, high quality action pics, and a reasonable price package.  Done, done, done, and done.After reading countless reviews and trying to make heads or tails out of every photography detail out there, I finally decided to purchase this awesome camera.  I could not be more satisfied.  After downloading the manual, it took me a couple of minutes to read about and set the action sports & burst settings.  With a couple of turns and button pushes, I was ready to go.  The pictures I took at the tourney are absolutely stunning.  I used the 5.5 pics/second auto focus burst mode and captured unbelievable action shots.  When my son went to shoot, I would capture the entire sequence from beginning to end with perfect focus - about 5 pics from the load to the end of the follow through.  Amazing is all I can say.  All I did was zoom in, put my son in the center of the frame, and press the button.  I was at least 50 yards away when I took the shots and they are perfect - like I was right next to him.  High level lacrosse is a very fast moving game and this camera made it simple to catch the action.  I would like to take some credit, but I would have no clue how to catch the shots that I did if this camera didn't make it so easy.In between games, we had the opportunity to head over to the beach a couple of times and the photos taken there with iA were just as good.  We took photos in bright sunshine, the shade, and at dusk using the iA mode and all the pictures were excellent.  We took some movies with the camera as well and they are also excellent.If I was a camera aficionado, maybe I would find some faults with this camera.  Since I am not, I can't find any so far.  If you are a novice like me, this camera will have you taking outstanding pictures as soon as the battery in charged.  Speaking of battery charge, we took about 800 pictures and five short movies over two days.  There was a lot of reviewing of pictures in the stands during this time and the total battery usage was about 1/3 of a full charge.  We used a class ten memory card and had no issues with lag or inability to shoot pics.  The camera's ergonomics are good.  Everything I used was well placed, easy to use, and I had no accidental touches that changed camera settings.  The camera seemed very lightweight - I mountain hike and this camera will definitely be in my pack from now on.I rarely write reviews - usually only if something is terrible or is a real pleasure to use.  This camera is definitely the latter.  If you need a camera to capture action shots and want to spend less than $500 bucks for the camera, card, case, etc. - you can stop comparing because this is it.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Dustin Widmann", "ReviewID": "R3ET7X7AJYND88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a camera that makes me want to find an excuse to play with a camera. :)Pros- The build feels solid.- It snaps shots off pretty fast.- Impressive focal length range (25mm-600mm equiv), even if the competition fairs a bit better this is still quite good.- Image stabilization works well. (I can snap shots off freehand at 24x zoom, and at least most of them will come out sharp. Not bad considering I have shaky hands.)- Has a pop-up flash, and also a hot-shoe for external flashes.- Can use a remote shutter with it (the $5 cheapos (such as the one made by Pixel) you find on amazon work fine too!), or an external mic.- It does 1920x1080@60p video, which is good. I got this for taking pictures though, not video.- Has 52mm filter threads. No adapter required. I can play with filters now! Telephoto/Close-up/wide-angle/fish-eye lenses are also an option available to this compact. I picked up a Raynox DCR-2025 telephoto lens to extend my reach. I also picked up a polarizer and some ND filters both for creative effect and to help with challenging lighting conditions.- The grip is good overall, and the controls seem to be in palatable places.- Intelligent Auto mode is intelligent (judges the scene, knows if you're shooting free-hand, etc). In most situations it makes good decisions.- Good manual controls.- Battery life is good.- Takes pretty pictures!! Colors seem accurate. Sharpness out-of-the-box seems about right. Noise doesn't become apparent until you really up the ISO. I've got some that I've taken at ISO 800 on a rainy day that aren't noisy.- RAW. This is one of the main reasons I went with this camera. The included RAW processing software (SilkyPix) is good, easy to use, and runs fine in Wine.- Fully articulated, hi-res, anti-glare LCD. Electronic viewfinder is a nice plus.- Very good low light performance for a compact.- Dedicated ISO button, function button (as in, you choose what you want the button to do.)Cons- Intelligent Auto mode will only record in JPEG.- idynamic only works if you're recording in JPEG.- Competition gives a bigger zoom for the $.- It doesn't make me breakfast. All cameras should make me breakfast.- Price. If I didn't need the zoom I probably would have went with a cheap DSLR instead. I may still do that and keep this for those situations where I need to zoom in, seeing as an equivalent telephoto lens would BE extraordinarily expensive (search for 600mm lens on Amazon, go on , I dare you! (Do be prepared to cringe if you do.))Other thoughts- If you've owned/used another Lumix in recent years, you'll be right at home with this camera as the menus/layout/etc are very similar.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Photography is fun again.", "Author": "D. L. Howe \"dave\"", "ReviewID": "RMP04HLJ6WGIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It all started with a trip to the grocery store with my wife.  There, in the parking lot was a car show; and all I had was her point and shoot camera.  At home, safely in the trunk of MY car was my professional DSLR with just the perfect lens for the cars.  As soon as I got home I went to[...]/  and did a camera feature search.In my opinion any of the current crop of \"all in one\" super zoom cameras is capable of taking nice, sharply focused pictures, so the trick would be to find one that met my particular style of shooting.  I like to take pictures in the HDR (High Dynamic Range) style which means I would need a camera that would bracket exposures - with a single press of the shutter.  I would also need a remote shutter release and the ability to save the pictures as RAW (for HDR pictures when there is movement and multiple exposures aren't practical).  As it turned out there was ONLY ONE camera that met my criteria; the Panasonic FZ150.  Given a choice of one, the decision was easy.I've had the FZ150 for a week now and I've put it through all its paces and judged the pictures.  I am truly amazed at how far camera technology has progressed.  The FZ150 continues to surprise me with its sharp focus and bright pictures.  Exposure bracketing is limited to three shots (one press of the shutter, three rapid snaps) but with RAW I can pull out twelve exposures 1 EV apart.  The \"motor\" drive is unbelievable with 12 shots each second.  The zoom is fantastic and I found that 24x (600mm+) allows me to take \"macro\" shots of insects from four feet away.It seems like (for me) photography just got fun again.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is it for me", "Author": "M. OBrien \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R42MP3MVDJAMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have playing in photography for fifty years, and have upgraded of late to a Canon 5D Mark II and a bag full of L-series lenses.  I finally decided this package is just too much in weight and size to carry around.  While I have a couple of point and shoots, neither have really good resolution.  After doing some research I decided a \"good\" mirror less bridge camera would fulfill my needs. I didn't realize I was beginning a quest.  The short version of which is the Panasonic is my seventh camera to evaluate.  What I wanted was a light weight mirror less unit with excellent resolution, good zoom and auto focus, flash and electronic viewfinder.  All the cameras had video, but I don't normally use it.  I should also mention I take many pictures of animals, dogs, horses and the miscellaneous bird.  Zero, or close to it, shutter lag is very important, as with some of the units tested my dog could literally walk out of the picture by the time the shutter tripped.  It was also very important my wife could pick up the camera and take a picture of whatever hit her at the moment.I bought my sample cameras at Best Buy, Costco and Amazon, which is my favorite except for the fact one can't handle the camera beforehand.  All have excellent, no hassle return policies which I made use of.  I evaluated two Nikons, at least one Sony, Canons and two Panasonics.  One Nikon was the relatively new V1, which took the best pictures (I felt) but didn't have a built in flash and I was  trying to stay away from interchangeable lenses.  Oddly, I could usually tell within five minutes whether the camera of the day was the \"right one\".  This bugged my wife who in the beginning would say \"why don't you give it a chance?\" to now, \"you haven't liked six others, you won't like this one!\"  Not surprisingly however, time won't cure the fact the camera doesn't feel good in one's hand, can't focus nor do whatever else you want.I should mention in passing my testing method is extremely rigorous.  I sit on my porch and take pictures of my dogs and horses who wander around the property.  One wouldn't think a camera would have trouble taking sharp, in focus pictures of a dog eight feet away, but most did.  As my price range was roughly $500 to $1,000, I don't think I was asking \"too much\" of the respective cameras.The Panasonic was ordered from Amazon and felt right coming out of the box.  It even had a user's guide which many did not.  It has no shutter lag, takes excellent sharp, well saturated pictures.  Low light sensitivity is good, and it is light weight.  It is a camera I will be comfortable using around town and on trips.  If you're on the fence, buy it from Amazon and you'll be happy you did.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with camera", "Author": "JCV", "ReviewID": "R1RC4K626B24NH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for taking indoor and outdoor amateur sports shots, group photos, artistic landscape pictures and pictures of people at events.  I wanted a camera that worked in high and low ISO ranges, had burst mode and a good wide and telephoto range, and had a viewfinder.  I also did not want to pay the expense of a DSLR or have to keep swapping lenses.After just a few weeks, I am very pleased with the FZ150.  It is significantly better than my previous digital cameras.  The 25mm to 600mm range is more than enough for most macro, wide angle or telephoto pictures that I can imagine taking.  As a test, I read a standard printed letter posted on a bulletin board from about 25 feet away by zooming in and reading it off the LCD screen.  At its widest setting, I could capture an entire room in one frame.  I am able to stand half as far back from groups as I needed to previously to get the entire group into the shot.  I was able to take a great macro shot of a remote control from a couple inches away, as well as of a trophy from 10 feet away.  The stabilization makes taking shots at 24x very doable even handheld.The burst mode menu is very nice and easy to access from a dedicated button on top of the camera.  Most cameras require a complex menu system to turn on and off the burst mode.  At 5.5 fps, I shot about 6 or 8 seconds of shots before a 1/2 second pause, and it continued with another 6 or 8 seconds of shots before the next pause.  The autofocus during burst was pretty good too, though obviously not as good as without burst mode.I like the on/off being a switch instead of a button.  One of my old cameras used to come on in the carrying case and chewed through batteries like candy.  The battery for the FZ150 seems to be pretty good.  I have done a lot of testing, including a lot of LCD screen and flash testing, and it seemed to take a while before it dropped a bar.  My only beef is that the charger does not have a light to indicate when the battery is done charging.  It merely turns off the other light that indicates it is charging.  The first time I went to charge the battery, I was not sure if it had come unplugged.Taking daylight scenery shots was very impressive as was the full telephoto range of these shots.  Taking nighttime shots was rather impressive and much better than any of my previous cameras.  I have not had many opportunities to take high ISO shots, especially indoor sports shots yet, but the limited shots that I did take give me hope that I found the camera that I want.  I will know more when spring sports season starts, though the high ISO sports shots will have to wait till fall sports to test.The biggest drawback to this camera is my inexperience with the Panasonic menu system.  It feels almost like relearning how to take pictures compared to my other cameras.  The menus and features are easy to get to and to manipulate, but without knowing what many of the icons mean, it is hard to know what to select.  The pdf manual is next to useless.  It took me nearly an hour to determine which setting meant \"fine\" vs. \"normal\" JPEG photo quality.  The manuals were useless and the web was no better.  I eventually figured it out by seeing which setting had the most number of pictures left on the card.  (The answer is that the arrow with the 2 rows of bars was the fine JPEG setting).  I suspect that anyone already familiar with Panasonic cameras will not have this issue, but it is a learning curve for me.  Also, for someone who just wants to leave it on iA mode, the camera can do all the work for you and the difficult menu icons are not a problem.  The iA mode actually does a fairly good job of selecting the right mode for the given shot, though it is not as consistent as manually turning the dial to the right mode, and often changes modes from one shot to the next, even if the situation has not significantly changed.Other than the learning curve, this is a wonderful camera.  The picture quality is very good.  The download software is good for an out of the box package.  I love the stereo-audio HD movies, though I do not shoot movies very often.  I like the fact that I can capture 3.5 Mpixel pictures while recording movies or after the fact in post production.  The native HD format was exceptionally good, though the translated MPEG2 format was a bit grainy.I was worried about the flash after reading some reviews about reflection from dust, but I did not see much problem with that, even when taking pictures out my open window during a snowstorm.  There were some \"bubbles\" but nothing that I have not seen with flashes from other cameras.  I also like that I have full control over the flash being open.  Many digital cameras automatically pop the flash up making it difficult or cumbersome to turn the flash off.  On this camera, if I don't want the flash to fire, I just don't pop it up.  I also like that it has the option to add an external flash or remote trigger, if I want to purchase the accessories.I was also worried about the \"plastic\" feel that many reviewers claimed, but I have not found any issues with that.  The camera feels solid and fits well into my hand.  While the zoom lever is not as comfortable as the barrel zoom of a genuine DSLR, it is still at least as comfortable and easy to use as any bridge or point and shoot camera that I have tried.  It is a little bigger than most point and shoot cameras, but it is smaller than most DSLRs and many bridge cameras.  I suspect that the reviewers who were complaining about the feel of the camera were comparing it to DSLR cameras.  This camera is probably the second best \"feeling\" digital camera that I have ever owned, after my seven year old Sony, which really did feel like a DSLR.  The biggest problem with my Sony is that it is hard to carry around, which is part of why I wanted a new camera.  The FZ150 is much easier to carry back and forth everyday.Overall, I would recommend the Panasonic DMC-FZ150 to anyone who wants a really good camera and doesn't want to fuss with the expense and additional lenses of a DSLR.As a note, I bought some accessories when I bought this camera.  Buying a filter to protect the lens is always a good idea.  I would recommend against doing what I did and buying a doubler and wide angle add-on lens for this camera until you see how well you like the range that it already has.  I am very pleased with the out of the box range and wish that I had not purchased the additional lenses, though they seem to work fine if as long as you use manual focus.For reference, I am a high school teacher and amateur photographer.  I take pictures of various school indoor and outdoor sporting events, as well as pictures of the students during classes, pep rallies and other special occasions.  I am the unofficial school photographer for the yearbook and school newspaper. I also shoot outdoor landscape pictures for fun.  I have been taking pictures with various cameras for about 30 years, starting with a Brownie Hawkeye as a child.  My previous digital cameras were Canon, Sony and Nikon brands.Update (3/14/12): I tried out the lowlight features at a high school musical this weekend and it worked great.  I put it on the \"high sensitivity\" scene mode and was able to take fairly clear pictures from row M.  It was a dark stage except for the spotlight on the singer.  From wide angle, the faces were washed out, naturally, since the costumes were dark, but when I zoomed in to let the performer fill the screen, I could actually get the eye color of the performer.  I had no trouble zooming even father to fill the screen with just a head shot that looked like I was standing 5 feet away.I took movies and captured still pictures both at the time of the event by pressing the button (which slowed the camera a little for half a second) and after the fact in post processing of the movie.  Both seemed to come out nicely, thought the post-processing pictures were smaller than the ones taken during the event.  The sound quality seemed to be as good as any dedicated amateur movie camera that I have seen in the past.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "Snapdrgn", "ReviewID": "R1OL0NEFS300EC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolute beginner photography enthusiast.

It turns out that the video was not \"jerky\" at all but the fault of my Microsoft Media Player program. That program, in my two year old computer, will not play video recorded in 1080p smoothly. I discovered Real Player will. Once I tried Real Player my criticism proved to be incorrect.Now I re-evaluate the FZ150.  It takes pictures as good as my FZ35 but no better. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it and the FZ35 produce images that are pretty darn good, especially from such a small sensor.Where the 150 really shines is in versatility and handling.  It has a nice \"heft\" to it which, to me, makes it feel like a quality piece of merchandise and in my big hands it feels right.The battery life has proven to be very good.  I've had the camera a week and have taken about a hundred pictures, about 15 minutes of video, played around with the camera menu settings and the battery indicator still shows two bars of the original three.  Very pleased with that aspect.The overall stabilization seems to be a little better then that of my FZ35, especially when shooting video.My original intent was to replace my FZ35 with a 4/3rds mirrorless or a SLR. When the FZ150 was announced it's features were so intriguing that I decided to wait and try it out.Under the right conditions (outside in good lighting) the images from the FZ35 and the FZ150 are really quite nice.  I have compared them with those from mirrorless and SLRs and they are surprisingly comparable, but not as good as far as noise is concerned.  The winnder there is the Sony NEX5N (if you can put up with its other vagaries). The ease of use and versatility, for my purposes, outweigh the small difference in image quality that you might get from the others.  I don't need nor want a complicated camera and I don't enlarge photos beyond 8x10. I am not a photographer, I'm a picture taker, but I really like the features that the FZ150 offers. I was going to spring for the FZ100 a while back but reviews critical of the image quality made me hold off; I'm glad I did.  Panasonic and Canon both as much as admitted that joining the mega pixel race was a bad mistake and the return to 12 from 14 makes a lot more sense.I'm very happy with my 150 and yes,  I know there are better cameras around and I'll probably buy one at a later date for but this one serves my purposes well.  Me buying a high dollar SLR and a multitude of lenses makes about as much sense as my buying a Ferrari instead of a Ford to go to the market for a carton of milk.11/17/2011 Follow upI attending my woodworking club meeting tonight and took over 80 pictures tonight without flash under artificial lighting - mercury vapor I think.

There are a couple of well-written long reviews that cover many technical details that I will not try to repeat.I am a long-time amateur photographer who has used and owns many SLR models as well as DSLRs and mirrorless compacts.Although I get may compliments on my photos, I really don't make any prints larger than 8x10, don't do anything commercial and my principal objective with my photos is to have memories of trips, friends and family.  In travel, I love ancient ruins, architecture, some scenic views and lifestyles that are different from my own. I have found that changeable lens cameras take wonderful photos, but in many conditions (dust, damp, climbing a ruin or back road path) changing lenses is a hassle and the weight of the equipment is a burden.This camera offers fine quality photos that meet all of my expectations, an ample zoom range that covers more range than multiple lenses for my DSLRs, and a multitude of features that often exceeds the feature set of much more costly cameras.My favorite thing about this camera is that it offers RAW format in addition to JPEG.  At one time I wasn't much of a fan of RAW images, but as I learned how to use post-processing to regain details in otherwise washed out skies or dark shadow areas, I discovered that it is possible to get photos that reflect more of what is seen with the eye (which has a greater dynamic range than a camera) using RAW.  Now I shoot RAW plus JPEG in most situations.  The RAW feature on this camera is something not on most \"bridge cameras\" and is the one single feature that convinced me to make the purchase.The camera's 24x zoom is not as long as the 30x and up on some bridge cameras, but the long end is equivalent to 600mm in a 35mm film camera.  That exceeds the focal length of virtually every interchangeable lens I have ever owned.  I don't need more.  Moreover, I don't want more.  At 24x, you are at about the real limit of zooming that can be done without serious quality sacrifice due to optical issues and due to the fact that at these extreme focal lengths, camera movement is wildly exaggerated, making it essential to have a pretty steady hand.On the negative side of things, I find the owner's manual to be irritatingly obfuscatory.  It really wouldn't take a lot of work to make it user friendly, but it seems to have been written by a non-native English speaker.  Struggling through it with camera in hand, you can eventually figure things out, but it is a labor of love at times.The camera has a mild HDR (high definition range) setting that is a little weak for true HDR.  I do like HDR photo capabilities -- not for their initial output, but for the fact that they can capture a wide range of light and dark and they can, with some tweaking of contrast and levels, become good JPEGs.  They can be very forgiving of difficult lighting situations.The camera is light to carry.  The battery has lasted longer than 300 shots (and I am taking shots with both JPEG and RAW outputs for the most part, which I count together as 1 shot) without going below 50% on the battery meter.All in all, I am very pleased with this camera and the photos I have been able to get out of it.  I expect that, in the near future, some e-bay shoppers will be getting terrific deals on my DSLR and mirrorless cameras as this camera appears to deliver everything I need.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrific camera for point & shoot users", "Author": "Irene123", "ReviewID": "R32IPNNZ8LQ1AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are a point & shoot camera person and you want a much better camera at a good price point with TONS more capability in iA mode and you don't want/know anything about lenses, filters, manual modes, etc., then YES! ABSOLUTELY, this is the camera to buy! I bought it just prior to leaving on an African Safari in April and had 10 days to work with it while reading through Amazon's reviews (Thank you, Rolla, excellent review/conversation strand!)to learn valuable information about working the camera since I am that point & shoot person. In his Oct 11, 2011, and Oct 21, 2011, posts, Rolla shares how to set the camera for best zoom capability. Also look at p65 in the online accessible Panasonic owners guide to see just how capable this camera is. I set my camera at 8mp picture size and got great zoomed shots in EZ and iZoom. Twice I went to maximum Digital Zoom (which is an extreme distance) and while yes I knew those two pics might show some pixellation on the computer (they did but it was minimal), I was very pleased that the print images still came out crisp. Burst mode and frames/second speed will knock your socks off. That's about as much technical knowledge as I have. The camera's auto-stabilizer capability did a superb job as all my shots & videos were handheld while we bounced around over rough terrain. We unexpectedly came upon a leopard after darkness had settled in and with just a few seconds and only the vehicles' headlights, I shot in iA mode and got the only usable picture. Those with lenses or fancier capabilities could not see in the dark(nor did they have the time)to work their cameras.Two insignificant negatives I have about this camera: one, it took me all of three days to lose the plastic twist on/off hood accessory, but out of over 2000 pictures, I had only 3 that showed a halo effect so I see no reason to try to replace the hood, which I'd probably lose again. And two, the button for video is flat enough to the surface that I tended to jiggle the camera while trying to shut off the video recording. I did get better as time went on so my advice is to practice before taking any important video. Also, as a point & shoot person, this camera obviously will not fit in a shirt/pants pocket. On the other hand, it has a good grip size and is quite compact, given its...did I mention amazing?...capabilities. I can carry it in my shoulder purse so it's no big deal.Accessories I purchased at a local camera shop: since I would be wearing it around my neck pretty much constantly for two weeks, a more well-padded neckstrap: OP/TECH Classic strap - 17.95; Kenko 52mm UV (O) digital filter to protect the camera's lens from fingerprints/scratches - 13.95; SanDisk SD-HC 8GB Ext HDV Class 10 SD Card - less expensive on Amazon.Accessories I purchased through Amazon: SanDisk Memory Card Carrying Pouch - 6.49; Zing 501-101 SBK1 Standard SLR Cover - 24.99; 2 Pack Battery and Charger Kit for Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ150 - 34.95.

The 42x zoom of the Nikon was very tempting, but ultimately I chose the Panasonic for its extra features, the great price I lucked upon, and its familiarity. The 150 is my third Panasonic and one of two ( a ZS7) I own currently. If you own or have owned a Panasonic, using the 150 should be easy for you.So far I have no regrets about choosing the Panasonic FZ150. When I buy a new camera (at least one a year) I look at as many photographs as I can taken with the candidates. Plenty of photos are on various review sites as well as on Flickr and Amazon.  In my internet travels I saw more outstanding photos taken with the Panasonic than with the Nikon.Some other things I considered:The Panasonic has the RAW photo option.The Panasonic can be fitted with filters and a telephoto lens. I have one on order.I liked the package of scene modes and effects on the Panasonic. Check them both out to see which you prefer.Yes, the Nikon has the longer zoom, but the Panasonic has something called Intelligent Zoom which will give you a 32x reach with no loss of quality. For twice that reach you'll have to drop down to five mega pixel pictures, but I've found even those to be acceptable.Also consider that the Panasonic has a hot shoe and a flip out LCD screen that enables you to even take pictures of yourself. The Nikon may have a brighter and better LCD screen, but the Panasonic's can be adjusted for brightness, and when the sun is just too much, there's always the viewfinder.More goodies on the Panasonic are the mike jack, large mode dial, great battery life, excellent image stabilization, a dedicated movie mode, and a zoom/focus control on the camera's side. Video quality is good on the Panasonic and with video configurability, one can get very creative.I have found the Panasonic to take excellent pictures in low light or bright light. Not all of the pictures taken with this camera have been keepers, but the majority have good color, tone , and detail.As a former owner of a Canon SX30, which isn't a bad camera, I prefer the performance, speed, and automatic settings of the Panasonic FZ150.UPDATE: A few dates after posting this review I took a series of shots of Mrs. Spudman's anniversary roses. Took some with the Panasonic and some with the Pentax K-r.  I could barely tell which pictures came from which camera. One of the best of the bunch came from the Panasonic FZ150. It's posted on Amazon..UPDATE 2 - Ever greedy for more zoom I bought a 2.2x telecoverter for the camera from a vendor on Amazon. On a trip to Cape May I didn't use the converter until the last day there, not out of need but out of curiosity. Even with \"only\" a 24x zoom, I seldom have a need for more reach except when I go undercover for the CIA. The teleconverter did expand my reach but at the expense of clarity and blur. A steady hand, some support,  or a tripod is recommended for these long shots.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic! Much better than FZ35.", "Author": "Denver Doc", "ReviewID": "R1PIUI4Q93HDZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Based on my extensive review of all superzooms, both in \"travel\" and \"bridge\" categories, I recently bought Lumix DMC-FZ35. I was hesitant because of its high market price for a 2-year old model. Nevertheless, Fz35 seemed to be the last \"bridge\" superzoom from Panasonic that got the picture quality right (their move to 14 MP CCD or CMOS sensors has not been a success from the image quality standpoint). Canons seem to have the best I.Q. overall, but significant chromatic abberation of their lenses turned me away, in addition to their bigger size and weight (I did not consider the longer zoom that useful). FZ35 seemed to be almost the smallest in the \"bridge\" category with significantly better picture quality then any \"travel\" superzoom. So I snapped one while they were still available.Testing FZ35 confirmed its great picture quality in the good light. However, bumping ISO to as little as 400 (which is needed to take a shot with moderate zoom in a shadow) produces degradation in image quality (I guess because of in-camera noise reduction). Going higher on ISO makes noise clearly visible, so much that indoor shots without a flash (which has quite a good range I must say) are no better than the ones from my old cheap compact. Video at the highest AVCHD setting (720p) does not look bad, but compared to my beloved (ancient) Canon HV20 camcorder, it does look a little choppy (? captured at 30p and recorded at 60p) and without fine detail. Quicktime MJPEG 1280x720/30p looks better (some blurring seems to come from AF struggling to keep focus with movement/zoom) but the files are huge. Despite FZ35's modest size and weight, unobtrusive lens and GREAT battery life (2 full days of shooting still pictures and video, using LCD, switching between record and play and all the time and I still have one bar on the battery left), the testing left me somewhat disappointed.Shortly after I purchased FZ35, I found sample pictures from FZ150 at imaging-resource.com (their Comparometer is a great tool). They looked (surprisingly) better than FZ35 even at good light. So, I took the plunge and got FZ150 too.Comparing the two, the drawbacks of Fz150 are its bigger size and weight (almost in dSLRs range, but in line with the rest of \"bridge\" superzooms) and shorter battery life.  The lens also protrudes nearly as much as some smaller dSLR lenses (albeit the zoom is much longer) and zooming does not feel as smooth/precise as on Fz35. Despite the size, the camera still feels balanced in one hand. If you like to hold it as a SLR, there is a new toggle on the lens barrel that can be used either for zooming or manual focusing (really cool). The rest is a litany of improvements over FZ35: LCD is fully articulated, twice the resolution and with very nice antireflex coating. The lens seems to have a better antireflex too. Image stabilizer and autofocus seem to be more effective. AF, and the entire camera operation, is MUCH faster. Burst mode works great and seems to be limited more by writing on SD Card than by acquiring/processing the images. Most importantly, the picture quality: In the optimal lighting outdoors it seems comparable to an entry-level dSLR. Detail definition the the dark areas is better and indoor low-light performance is much better than FZ35 (ISO1600 still usable; seems to be on par with or better than any other \"bridge\" superzoom). Handheld night shots now use the same principle, acquiring multiple images with shorter exposure and combining them together, that has been a feature of Sony superzooms for quite some time. They still cannot rival long exposure tripod shots but are quite usable, at least for small prints. Finally, video quality is considerably better, not only because of 1080p mode, but jitter also seems to be less pronounced, even if the zoom is longer. (I still feel my old camcorder does HD video a bit better though. FYI, both MP4 and AVCHD play flawlessly on PS3 directly from SD Card with an USB adapter; or you can buy mini-HDMI adapter/cable.)I personally would love if Panasonic put the new sensor and image processor in the old FZ35 body/lens, but market seems to prefer longer zooms these days. From all other perspectives, FZ150 will be a great all-in-one camera for travel that will likely allow me to leave my camcorder at home.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Replacement for FZ100", "Author": "lordhoot \"lordhoot\"", "ReviewID": "R1O5LRR4697URT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an owner of Panasonic FZ100, I was generally happy with that camera and I could live with its shortcomings because it did most things pretty well. But when the chance came, I brought the new Panasonic FZ150 to see if this camera can do better.It does! On the surface, the body of FZ150 and FZ100 are totally alike. Only major difference lies at the barrel where there is a zoom controller on the FZ150 and not on the FZ100. It weight about the same, same size, they even shared the same battery so if you own FZ100, the battery for that will work on FZ150. Very helpful for me and for any other owners of FZ100.In a nutshell, FZ150 does everything FZ100 can do and better. It doesn't add anything really new but changes what needed to be changed to make it better. They did switched out into a new CMOS sensor with lower megapixel and were successful in making the quality images that easily surpassed FZ100. There is a new OIS stabilizer and the high sensitivity mode that allowed you to shoot night photos has been improved. Auto-focus speed on the FZ150 have also been drastically improved. Like I wrote, everything FZ100 can do, FZ150 can do better.The video capability has been improved and I think there is a slightly better video coming out of this camera then its older brother.Some of the new features as 3D mode is nice but I have no real use for it. It doesn't have a GPS but who needs that in a camera??If there are people who might be thinking about upgrading, I would say its worth an upgrade because the improvements are pretty major. You would think Panasonic would give owners of FZ100 some coupon discount or something for the upgrade.For many, the major shortcoming of this camera is the 24x zoom which is one of the lowest in the ultra-zoom camera class nowadays. Canon SX40 got what...34x or something like that? But I do know that Canon SX40, their new flagship of the ultra-zoom still got a major autofocus problem that can't get a fix in changing light condition that FZ100 can do with ease.

The auto-focus and flash work well and respond quickly.  There is almost no shutter lag so no need to lock the focus with a half press of the shutter.Long zoom - When I had my first chance to use the camera it was already dark so for a quick test I went outside, pointed the camera at the moon, zoomed all the way, adjusted the brightness 3 full stops and from a standing position with no support took a great picture of the moon.  There is surprising detail in the light and dark areas and even at 24x no adverse blurring effects of a hand held fully zoomed photo.

When travelling I no longer carry a video camera, I take all my videos with a digital camera.  The early reviews of this camera suggested it excels at HD video and I can confirm it does.  The video & audio are both great, and so far I have not detected any noise caused by zooming while recording.Slow Motion video - Another feature that led me to this camera.  I have now shot several high speed / slow motion videos and am very happy with the results.  It performs as well as I need it to for this feature.  The quality is as good as you expect for the lower resolution captured in HS mode.  The camera is probably average in this category.  There is only one HS mode available and the resolution is OK but not great, also  you are shooting over 200fps so do not expect to use this in low light conditions.  Note that you access this feature through the Scene Mode (SCN).Burst mode - This is amazingly fast, 12 full resolution frames in a second.  It will burst as long as you hold down the button up to the maximum number 12 at the fastest rate.  This works better than other cameras I have used.  A great option for fast action.3D photos - Am interesting feature.  I am not sure I will use this  but I took a few to see how it works.  The process to take 3D photos is to switch to SCN mode, pick 3D, and then hold down the shutter as you slide the camera to the right.  It took a little practice to be able to do this reliably.  You need a 3D TV to playback the photos in 3D.I will post more later when I have had more time with the camera.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "For quality and features, this is a surefire winner!", "Author": "Robert Stuthridge Ph.D., CPE \"Robert\"", "ReviewID": "R2AJMP6DSNX63O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Zoom range and maximum zoom image quality are superb.Full manual over-ride, and lots of user-adjustable programs make this appeal to experienced photographers, while the results from fully automatic settings are high quality. Great quality movies!Cons: Macro is good but not stunning - but macro lenses can be added if that's your thing, using the 52mm screw mount.I did a couple of weeks research before taking the plunge with this camera, and I am not in any way disappointed with my decision. Over the past 30 years, I've used the very top Nikon SLRs (35mm film), and for work, I've always gone with the mid-range Olympus compacts, most recently using the excellent Olympus C-5060. I decided I wanted greater zoom range and higher quality video than the C-5060 could offer, both for my consulting work and for home/recreational/travel use, but didn't want the weight and bulk that are the downsides of DSLRs.The Lumix FZ150K has exceeded my expectations; Image quality - even at maximum zoom and handheld - is amazing for a non-SLR, and only under considerable enlargement is processing/loss of detail evident. Video performance is top notch, easily matching my Sony mini-DVR camcorder.The FZ150K is extremely easy to use, with good ergonomics (at least for me), although some users with large fingers may find the buttons a bit fiddly at first - like any camera, you have to use it to become used to it - that's when you can start concentrating on the image, not on the machine you use to record it!This weekend I have been photographing birds around our property, and also taking night shots, and my friends are amazed by the great images I easily managed to obtain, thanks to the camera's quality Leica lens and useful settings. This Lumix brings the FUN back to taking photos! The picture burst modes are astonishingly good - because Panasonic have managed to design an autofocus system that is blindingly fast. Allied to this is the highly effective image stabilization, and the result is that duff shots are very rare. I took maybe 350 photos on the first day, and discarded about 6-8 due to blur. The rest were in focus, and nicely exposed. Taking pictures of a backlit feeder with some finches on it simply required adjusting the exposure using the rotary dial above the display screen - easy and intuitive. That's what makes the camera so quick to get used to. Add to its excellent ergonomics unusual features like 220fps high-speed movie setting for slo-mo playback, and good stereo sound with a highly effective wind-noise filter, and you have a camera that really does manage to deliver in every department.I would certainly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a very good point and shoot, but it is also worth considering against DSLRs by Canon, Nikon, Olympus and the like.

By the time you learn to use them all, the camera will be a couple years old, and there will be something else. But it will take something truly exceptional to unseat this one. I just used mine at our office Christmas party, and I used the Manual mode to capture the true color of all the lights. Until you try Manual, or the other creative control settings like Aperture and Shutter priority, you can't fully appreciate what this camera can do. I love the little bar at the bottom of the screen in manual mode that lets you see the exposure level (+/- 2 stops) as you scan around the scene. But that's just one of what seems like hundreds of features. All I can say is buy one, and then experiment. Every time I pick mine up, I find something new.Someone said this is not supposed to be a video camera. But isn't THAT one of the main reasons for buying a digital camera with video? It's like hunting: years ago they made rifles that also had a shotgun barrel under the rifle barrel - you never knew which one you'd need in the field. Well, THAT'S the reason for having a combination still and video camera - sometimes you need a camera, and sometimes a camcorder. With this one, you can truly carry just one lightweight device.I loved the AVCHD on my FZ100, but having both 1080p AVCHD and H.264 Mpeg4 in the same camera is a real deal-maker for me. The AVCHD is as smooth and clear as a camcorder, and the H.264 lets me take low-light hi-res videos that play on a computer. And the 1080p H.264 on this camera blows away the 1080p on my Nikon 8100. Rather than rave on, let me just summarize what I think are some pros and cons:Pros:  - Battery meter works with \"aftermarket\" batteries as well as Panasonic.  - Both AVCHD and H.264 Mpeg4 video recording in 1080p mode.  - True dedicated hot shoe, compatible with Panasonic and Olympus flashes  (most, anyway).  - Lightning fast burst modes: faster than the FZ100, and it smokes the SX40HS.  My sports pictures amaze people.  - New sensor works better in low light. Pictures are good up to ISO 1600.  - Q Menu button allows for quick setting changes. This makes the camera more  fun to use.  - The Leica lens is more accurate than other brands. Very little chromatic  aberration (green & purple fringing) at the edges of the pictures.  - IQ mode works well enough that my family can also use this. Well, maybe that  should be listed under \"Cons.\"Cons:  - Tele/Wide button on the lens barrel is too close to the Macro/AF/Manual  focus slider switch. It's easy to accidentally move that slide switch  while using the tele/wide button, so I just don't use it.  - As with the FZ100, the electronic eyepiece viewfinder isn't as good as it  could be, although I like the diopter eye correction wheel on the side.In a nutshell, this camera gives me features and results that are close enough to an entry-level DSLR that I no longer pour over the Sunday ads, trying to find a special on DSLRs like the Rebel T3i or the Nikin 5100.

What I will say is that the quality of the lens on this camera is one of the best and most astonishing surprises I've ever experienced. I bought it just before heading to a family reunion--we were simply too limited on luggage for me to take my DSLR, but I knew I would need zoom capability, and 24X is all I care to have in this type of camera.There were all ages at this reunion, and being able to capture shots of the little ones in action was one of my greatest concerns. The combination of this camera's processor and its lens made getting the very best shots absolutely effortless. Although I tried setting the mode dial to certain types of scenes, that was a wasted effort--on the iA setting, the camera already chose those settings--the exact same ones I was going to choose--in every single situation. When the little ones went through the waterfall in the pool, every single droplet of water was as sharp as could be, as well of course as the kids' faces.One of the biggest surprises was that I expected that, as usual, there would be no pictures of me in our memories because I'm always the one behind the camera (sound familiar, anyone?). But this camera is so easy to use that, while I was in the pool, our daughters (adults) picked up the camera and captured dozens of excellent, perfectly timed shots of me. I had given them no instruction of any kind, simply left the camera up high enough where small people couldn't reach it, but adults could. Nearly every shot taken with this camera wound up in our book of memories that we assembled after the reunion.I know that this camera has already been \"replaced\" by the new Panasonic DMC-FZ200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom, but I have yet to see how the  processor on the new camera will work, especially with the full-range 2.8 aperture. It may be great, but if the FZ 150 is still available, I think it is an outstanding buy.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unmatched versatility in a lightweight package", "Author": "Shane O.

Well sorta, as I still have my D90 and love it's image quality.  Alas, when I tried to get the light gathering ability and telephoto capabilities on the DSLR, I ended up lugging around a Sigma 50-500mm f/4.5-6.3 APO DG OS HSM SLD Ultra Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital DSLR Camera as well as a couple other lenses.  While this gave great image quality, it also provided quite a workout.  In the end it was starting to be way too much, and it certainly drew a lot of attention.  So now I'm here!So what does this baby offer?  Plenty.  I won't rehash everything listed in the description and marketing spiel, but I will say it's an awesome camera for what it is (compact ultrazoom).  At ISO 100-400 it offers solid image quality indoors and out, plus the RAW capability allows those who partake in RAW editing to eek out a bit more IQ.  With ample light it can go to ISO 800 easily, and its stabilized lens helps give some leeway with shutter speeds.  It's got loads of automatic modes I've only started to dabble with (as an avid DSLR user I'm mostly using aperture and shutter priority modes right now), and I wouldn't hesitate to hand it to a novice to take a great pic.  The available flashes, converter lenses, and other accessories can extend it's capabilities a bit more if you're so inclined.  That's the good stuff, now the ... great stuff!OMG this is so freaking light.  It's way lighter than anything that touches my Nikon, let alone the whole kit.  It's way lighter than it's ancestor FZ10 or anything I've used in ages.  It's small too, but the lightness is amazing.  The video is also absolutely amazing.  The still IQ is good (coming from a great DSLR), but the video IQ is phenomenal.  Originally I planned on using this whenever I didn't want to lug the SLR around or when I needed more reach (I sold the \"Bigma\"), but the video capabilities will see this puppy used a lot more.  It really blew me away.  Lastly, it's wicked fast all around, especially focusing.Any negatives?  Not really.  IQ could be better, but not at that sensor size or with such a versatile lens.  I'm reluctant to zoom in at a pixel level, where I'd do that in a heartbeat with my D90, but it's not a huge deal.  The body is plastic, but it's well made and I'd rather save the weight.  The lens extends, but it's better than being bigger all the time, so no biggie.  The battery is proprietary, but what isn't in this class?  The interface did take some getting used to, but it's not horrible (it would be one of my biggest areas for improvement).  I do however wish it had GPS, which is my #1 wish for it's successor.There you have it, a great camera, with a few things to get used to and a whole lot of upside.

But it has firmware that severely limits its functionality for my purposes (iso limits, lack of RAW support, etc.).  It would otherwise be a very capable camera.First and foremost, the clarity and smoothness of the FZ150 video is far better than I had hoped for.  The 60fps frame rate makes all the difference in the world over 24fps.  I'm so glad I didn't settle for less!  It takes some processing power to play it, though.  My laptop isn't fast enough, so I either plug the card into my TV or PS3's USB or use a minihdmi-to-hdmi directly from the camera.Zooming and autofocus are enabled while recording, though autofocus is disabled while zooming.  The tracking focus can keep birds in focus as they fly by.  The only issue I have is with the camera automatically enabling OIS for videos.  It works great for hand-held shots at high zoom values, but only when the camera needs to be held still.  I found that overall it made my videos very jumpy/jerky, so I disabled OIS for videos in the options and it now works exactly how I like.The 24x zoom can focus in on objects only a few feet away, allowing near-macro shots or very detailed video of skiddish animals from a distance.  I dismissed the izoom feature as just a fancy autofocus (and imo, for full-frame images, it still is), but in video mode the izoom goes up to 32x zoom with no loss of quality.  That was a very nice unexpected surprise for me.This camera has a very fast shutter response and autofocus, greatly reducing the number of missed or blurry shots.  When zoomed in the autofocus tends to keep farther objects in focus.  This can be addressed by putting the camera in macro mode, or by using manual focus.  It can also take pictures very quickly.  It is hard to explain how fast 12 fps is, but I can best compare the sound of the shutter while in burst mode to a (very quiet) machine gun.  It also recovers _very_ fast for another burst.The color accuracy in the pictures and small screen is top-notch.  I take a picture, hit review, and the colors are very close to the real scene I just pictured.  I've tried this with mountains, clouds, flowers, and even a bon fire with great results.I read elsewhere that it had no HDR capabilities, which means I'd have to painstakingly adjust the EV up and down for each HDR I want, potentially ruining the shots.  But it actually does have automatic HDR functionality, even if it is hard to find.  In the P/A/CUST and a few other modes, hitting \"up\" on the directional pad adjusts the usual EV and Flash levels, but there is also something called \"exposure bracketing.\"  This sets the min/max exposure values around the center, and automatically takes 3 pictures with those values whenever the shutter is pressed.  So it can easily take quick hand-held HDR's.  Oddly, the bracketing is reset whenever the camera is turned off, so you have to set it again.The panorama assist function is nice.  No more need to approximate the overlap for the next image.  I still prefer to wing it to save time.There are some small complaints I have, though.  The options and button functionalities change depending on which mode the camera is in.  This got annoying fast, and made it difficult to really learn the camera well.  It's not a big problem, just takes a bit sometimes to find what I want.The HDR functions aren't in iAuto.  It is annoying to have to change modes so often.The lens is very vulnerable in its position.  I keep accidentally touching and smudging it.  I've ordered a filter kit so I can use the UV filter to protect the lens.On a side note, \"night portrait\" mode isn't really designed for night portraits where there are sources of light other than the camera's flash.  A few of my first \"night portrait\" pictures look very much like everyone in it was blazing with fire (it looked very real, actually). I later deduced that the shutter stays open for a short while after the flash fires, leading to some very interesting effects if the camera or subjects move after it fires. (In the flaming people example, I had apparently lowered the camera after the flash fired.)  This can be stopped by changing the mode to \"candle light,\" among others.

Here are some Tips and Caveats:**IMPORTANT:  If you buy additional lenses - macro, telephoto, fish eye - be sure to purchase the FZ150 adapter tube FIRST.  While telephoto and macro lenses may have compatible size to screw directly onto the FZ150, the weight of the glass will burn out the FOCUSING motor of your camera, making it impossible to focus after that - which is something to think about if buying any telephoto point and shoot that is 'used'.  The adapter tube is made to bear the weight of heavy lenses, transferring it to the body of the camera, not the motor.  Also, the adapter length is designed to keep your camera's focusing from hitting a lens on the end of the adapter, so avoid purchasing shorter tubes.  Generic adapter tubes for the FZ150 may have varied lens size (e.g., 52mm,58mm, etc.) on the far end, so buy lenses for it accordingly.  It might be wise to visit the Panasonic site to get an idea of features to look for in generics.**For generic lenses that are too small or too large, there are both step-up and step down rings available on Amazon to help make adjustments for attachments that don't fit. Ring sizes are labeled by male thread starting from camera body outward.  e.g. a 52mm-55mm ring is a step up with the 52mm male thread closest to the camera. Same for step down rings e.g. 55mm-52mm.  They can be used in combination until your lens fits the FZ150 adapter tube.  They're a worthwhile investment.**The included tulip lens hood conveniently locks backward bayonet-style to the camera for compact storage but tends to block the telephoto button until attached correctly during shooting.**For newbies:  Buy products specifically labeled compatible for the Lumix FZ150 or you might have lenses and accessories that don't fit. One size does not fit all.**Attachments:  The FZ150 uses a finely threaded screw-on type of attachment, not bayonet style, so watch for grit or misthreading of attachments.  Metal accessories may preserve thread integrity better than a plastic choice.  A good forced air lens cleaner kit should keep threads in good working order.**Go for the best quality glass optics.  A poor quality lens will never focus correctly.  Optics quality will always trump number of megapixels.  The FZ150 has a German-made Leica lens, quality similar to that used in micro- and geo-systems.**Number of megapixels is most useful primarily in enlargements.  Quality increase is negligible over 6MP if you only intend to make 8x10s.  More MPs is advised if you plan to make posters of your photos.**The FZ150 uses 52mm filters.**Lenses have coatings on them; resist cleaning kits that emphasize rubbing to remove spots.  Spray fluids to a cloth first and never directly on the lens, working spirally from the center outward.**a rain hood helps keep moisture out the camera as well as dust and sand on windy shoots.  These can be purchased or made.  Buy or make a hood that allows room for your accessory flash.  Remember the zoom tends to suck dust into the adapter tube so dismantle pieces with the camera pointed down.**A camera strap for your hand may be useful as it allows you to fully stretch your arm to your side, while the neck strap does not. This item may be better purchased at a camera shop to be sure it fits your FZ150 strap rings and attachment ports.  While high quality wrist/hand straps are available on Amazon, both hand comfort as well as secure fit to the camera body trump price.**The box contains wall charger only. Extra battery with car charger may prove useful.**Class 10 SDHC memory chips will yield best image quality storage and video performance at about 10MB per sec (compared to 6MB/sec for Class 6, etc.). Minumum recommended by Panasonic is Class 4.  However Panasonic warns of video recording stopping in the middle of a Class 4, possibly due to its limited data transfer rate. Use larger Class and storage size for video.  A 32 GB gives over 4 hours video in lowest AVCHD quality and about two and a half in highest HD; even more as mp4.  Just remember performance speed falls off with data storage, so it pays to move your pictures and videos to a hard drive and keep the chip as unencumbered as possible, particularly for burst shooting or video. Format a new card INSIDE THE CAMERA to fit its firmware, insuring fastest video recording rates for this gear, but use a card reader to move images to your hard drive. It's faster and less work for the FZ150.  And as is the way of all things, cards do wear out with use - corrupted images or dropping pics entirely.  Many photographers rotate firmware-formatted chips to keep them ready and reliable.Among others on YouTube, there is a particularly thorough 8 part, step by step Lumix FZ150 tutorial beginning w/ \"Understanding the Panasonic FZ150, Part 1 Intelligent Auto (iA mode)\" where camera features and settings can be quickly learned by video example. The Panasonic site also has fairly good tutorials on both understanding DSLR operation as well as tips for taking better pictures.  While Panasonic has replaced this camera with the FZ200 after a mere 9 months, it's no reflection on the quality or customer satisfaction with the FZ150.  There is a significant price increase associated with the newer model, making the FZ150 still a steal for stellar performance and few if any customer complaints.

All of them were very good in some areas, lacking in others. In my opinion the FZ150 is the best of the lot, with the best performance and image quality. Its response time is short and snappy. With some tweaking either in-camera or in post-production you can create excellent photos. I have been particularly amazed at the clarity at extreme zoom settings. And the handiness of the fold out screen cannot be overstated. When shooting video, this screen is also the best you can do with getting the best angle.BUT. Here is the biggest caveat. The MICROPHONE is NOT WELL ISOLATED. The mic is very sensitive and clear. SO sensitive that it picks up every little vibration from handling during shooting. I hear this MUCH more than from recordings made on the FZ35. The mic also PICKS UP ZOOM MOTOR NOISE! That's right. You will get a slight but definite buzz during the whole zoom range. You'll also hear the zoom button snap back to the center position at the end of your zoom. VERY BAD. This is a basic rule for video camera mics - don't pick up your own camera sounds! This means you will need to be VERY careful in handling during shooting. In noisy environments this whole issue may be masked by your room sounds. But in a quiet environment, like during church ceremonies, you WILL hear the zoom motor. I am very disappointed with the MIC issues. Using either zoom button does not remedy the zoom motor sound.That being said, the image quality of the video is excellent as well. You will be very happy with the camera in general as long as you can work around the MIC issues.

The reason is that I found the auto bracketing system for exposure and white balance (the picture takes the same image three times, one at low exposure, one at mid, and one at high, and combines them into a single image) could produce brighter images in low light using a faster shutter speed than I could take in low light using a slower shutter speed. These speeds are based on my ability to keep my hand steady and take a picture without a tripod, and of course this camera has its limits before the flash is necessary. I did not get the \"soap bubbles\" effect that another user seemed to experience, though I have gotten that effect on other cameras for outside shots in high humidity and I don't think there is a whole lot the camera can do since the camera can't make water droplets not reflect the light from its flash.The video quality is very very good. I was debating between buying the Panasonic TM900 with a separate still camera but I've been pretty satisfied with the video on the FZ150 that I'm just going to stick with this camera. It seems to have very low noise in low light and a big part of that is due to the fact that, not only can you adjust the ISO sensitivity while shooting video, but, if you set the camera to manual focus, you can slow the shutter speed down to 1/8th of a second. I really like that. The video is obviously a bit blurred but, if using a tripod, it is a great way to brighten the scene without increasing the ISO. With autofocus enabled, you can slow the shutter down to 1/30th of a second. The autofocus is pretty quick.And that brings me to the one problem that annoys me. When shooting video in manual mode, the camera does a good job showing you how dark the image will look as you adjust the settings in real time. However, once you are recording, depending on the lighting conditions, the LCD screen will adjust in brightness to compensate for the scene. While this can be great, this freaked me out at first because I thought that it was also changing the exposure of the video being taken, but it does not. Sometimes. The brightness does change when you zoom in and out depending on the light, and I'm not sure if that's just the light flooding the lens but the increase in brightness happens in subtle but noticeable steps, not gradual. Again, this seems to really happen while zooming, and this is while the camera is in manual video mode. The only way to get around this is to set the video mode to \"Program AE\", which is stupid considering I should be able to lock the exposure completely within the manual mode. In \"Program AE\" mode you cannot change the aperture or shutter and the LCD screen will still change brightness while the video does not. I have not been able to find a way to lock the LCD brightness in this regard. Also, while the LCD screen will darken while you increase the shutter speed in real time, it does nothing when changing the shutter speed while in manual photo mode. You have to press the shutter button half way down to preview the brightness at that setting. While that is not a big deal, it is an example of the kind of inconsistent performance this camera has between scenarios. While the camera is in manual focus, it is possible to blur the image while focusing beyond the infinity mark somehow...it's weird.One reason why I chose this camera over the Canon SX40 HS was due to some reviews that mentioned how useless its starry sky 30 second exposure mode was. Unfortunately, the FZ150's starry sky mode is just as useless, being locked at 200 ISO. If you can change it, I haven't seen how. The low ISO lock meant that I was able to get far brighter images using the camera's regular manual mode (which can shoot a single exposure for up to 15 seconds) with a higher ISO.Despite the odd issues with exposure changes in manual mode, which I can understand might be a deal breaker for a lot of people, I do intend to keep this camera because, for the way that I film and what I film, it shouldn't become that much of an issue all things considered. I also really like the 1/8th of a second shutter speed using manual focus. Plus, as someone who loves time lapse photography, the fact that I can plug in an intervalometer is reason enough for me to stick with it without going into a pricier DSLR. The white balance and exposure bracketing works well. For the price, this camera really is a good choice. Just understand how it behaves in relation to your shooting/filming habits. If anybody has suggestions on why my camera might be adjusting exposure in manual mode while zooming, please let me know. If I find a way to overcome that I will post it here.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Super Zoom EVF Camera for Beginner to Expert or Pro thats fun to Use", "Author": "Roger James \"Doc\"", "ReviewID": "R2GPMQUCW9UVTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the FZ150 to upgrade and replace my Canon SX10is which has proven to be an excellent camera.  I chose the Panasonic because of excellent reviews and it seemed to have the right balance of upgraded features and performance. Before I bought the FZ150, I checked out the Canon SX40hs because it also had excellent reviews. The camera took very nice pictures but the camera did not feel as solidly constructed as the Panasonic. The SX40 had many new features and better image quality than past models, but it is just an upgraded SX30 which I found very disappointing. I thought the 36X zoom was too much unless you use a tripod. The Panasonic in contrast has a very solid feel and seems to have an excellent build quality at least on the surface. The camera starts up very quickly, and has very fast autofocus even with extreme telephoto providing there is sufficient light. The image quality is very good to excellent at 100 ISO and higher and degrades  a little as you stepped up to 3200. The 3200 ISO pictures had some noise but were a lot better than I've seen on previous small cameras. The vast majority of images I took with the Panasonic came out properly exposed,looked very sharp for a small sensor camera. Is the Panasonic perfect....no! I think it is the best super zoom out there. The Canon SX40hs is also a very good camera and would have been a good upgrade for my S2, S3, sX10 so it would be natural to want the SX40hs but the FZ150 has it beat in  features, performance and especially speed.The image stabilization with the camera is impressive to awesome. It is possible to get sharp images with the camera hand held with full zoom providing there is sufficient light. I think the reason for this is possible because of the improved image stabilization. The FZ150 is incredibly light and with the EVF (electronic viewfinder), it is possible to hold the camera much steadier. The low light capability is much better than my SX10, so in most situations, it is possible to get an acceptable images at a higher ISO.The FZ150 accepts 52 mm filters which is a standard size and easy and inexpensive to purchase. It's important to place a filter on the lens to protect it. This also helps in image capture with UV or Polarizer filters. The raw format is another important feature missing from competitors cameras. The extra mike port and the remote shutter port makes the camera more  useful. The best part of the camera is the incredible speed of focus, and speed of picture taking that rivals DSLR's. This camera is a natural for anyone that already has a DSLR and wants an all in one big zoom. The macro capability is limited to wide angle for closeup but using the zoom you need to back up to get proper focus. You can get very good macro pictures but DSLR are far better at that. This is a problem with all super zoom cameras but with practice you can get great macro images.I found the camera worked great using the default settings even on P which means even a beginner could use this camera with ease and grow into the more exotic feature set. I even think the pros out there would have a lot of fun with this camera because they wouldn't have to keep changing lens and all that it entails.  If you are an advanced amateur, you would also have a lot of fun using this camera and you might want to quietly retire your DSLR and save it for the occasional need for extra image quality. When I need super images, I still take out my DSLR but not often. Nothing beats a DSLR for macro work.One problem I encountered was the rear dial which is very stiff and I kept pressing it while trying to turn it. I checked with Panasonic and this is done by design. Turning the rear control more slowly provided better results. The Canon rear dial spun very easily and I preferred that feel. I understand the FZ100 had a dial that turned too easily and this is supposed to be an improvement. This is the only control that I thinks needs improvement in the next model.The video was excellent and  continues to surprise me with how great it is. I don't think the video from this camera or any DSLR will match what you can get from a good HD camcorder. It's very convenient to have excellent HD video in one unit. In reviewing the video for the last month I am stunned that it is as good as it is.The bottom line is that as good as the FZ150 is and it probably is the very best long zoom camera, it can't replace a pocket subcompact, or a video cam. When I travel I will take the FZ150 as my main camera, my Canon S95 (this is a great camera) for the pocket camera, and my Canon Vixia HD Camcorder. The weight of these three cameras is less than a DSLR with one zoom lens. It is impossible for one camera to do everything well no matter how good it is. This camera comes very close to perfect.Overall, I really like the Panasonic FZ150 a lot and think it is well worth the price and 5 stars, perhaps 5 star plus. It feels nice in the hand and looks good too. It takes excellent images and video and allows a lot of photo creativity. If you have never used a super zoom, its a great camera that once you use it, you may want to put away your DSLR if you have one. It is a fun camera for a beginner or expert photographer. I have tried the other super zooms out there and most have similar features. I think the Panasonic leads the field but the Canon, Nikon, Fuji and Sony all make similar cameras but not as good as this camera. It can be hard to chose. I recommend this Panasonic model and Amazon as always is a terrific company to buy from.Update:12/27/11The camera continually amazes me with outstanding performance. The more I use the more I like it. I took it on a 11 day cruise to the Caribbean and took some fantastic images. One cruiser was so impressed with the camera that he purchased one (FZ100) at the next port we stopped at. I would not recommend that because of warranty issues. I've used the rainbow imaging wireless remote (Rolla recommended) and it works very well. The vast number of images taken about 3000+ have come out very sharp, well exposed with natural coloring. The image stabilization has been very effective with virtually all of the long range zoom images even up to 36+ ia. Having standard 52 filters has come in handy especially using the circular polarizer. One disappointment which is true for all bridge zooms is that macro focusing requires backing up about 5-6 feet from your target while in zoom unless you macro in wide angle which will focus very closely under 1 foot. I generally use a DSLR for any real macro work since lenses will allow close focusing.Since I purchased this camera I have looked in every camera store and never saw the FZ150 being sold. I bought this camera sight unseen so many of you if in the same situation may need to take a great leap in faith to purchase this camera. The camera seems in short supply now so you may need to be patient if you do decide to buy it. I think this camera along with the other competitors are improving the super zoom cameras by leaps and bounds and if they could enlarge or improve the sensor and continue with improved lense design that at some point in the future they could outsell the DSLR and render them obsolete. The picture quality is so good even now that most of the time I prefer using the FZ150 to my Canon T1i and Canon 18-200is which is no slouch.Update:4/6/2012The more I use the FZ150 the more I enjoy using it. It has performed flawlessly and is one of the first cameras I grab when wanting a quick shot. I do take more shots with my Canon S95 subcompact because it can be carried everywhere and it take superb images for a tiny camera. I am planning to take the FZ150 on a cruise to Alaska soon and will test it against my new Canon 60D DSLR with Canon 18-200 Zoom lens. This doesn't seem like a fair test but I am very confident that the FZ150 will hold its own because of it's speed, great EVF and versatility. The FZ150 is also much lighter, has wider angle, and more zoom so I expect it may get more use. I will report back in June with my results. The 60D does have better weather seals so if its raining, it may get more use. I was so impressed by the Panasonic FZ150 that I bought the Panasonic TM900 camcorder recently also sight unseen. Its a great camcorder and the video is fantastic but more surprisingly this camcorder takes excellent digital stills too. This was my 4th Panasonic camera product and they all have been excellent with very good quality, good performance and very reliable. One tiny tidbit....I tried out the new Canon G1X compact digital camera with the dslr sized sensor. The FZ150 significantly outperformed the G1x in every way except the G1x may have had a little better image quality but was a pain to use and cost twice the price of FZ150. I think the current $400 plus price for the Fz150 is a real bargain for this great quality camera.Update:2/20/13The FZ150 has performed wonderfully since I first purchased it. I brought this camera on a cruise to Alaska, along with my TM900 camcorder, and several other subcompact cameras including my Canon S95 which is a terrific subcompact camera. The video I took with the FZ150 equaled the video from the camcorder so I used just the FZ150. The camera was so fast at focusing even with full zoom, I was able to catch rare images of Whale sightings over 1 1/2 miles away in the overcast skies, and even captured an eagle in rapid flight some distance away.The conditions were cloudy and light rain practically the entire trip so I used a shower cap to protect the camera in the rain and it managed through the very difficult and cold conditions. I have since upgraded the camera to the new FZ200 with the F2.8 lens and my wife is using the FZ150. Her images matched the FZ200 except in low light where the FZ200 really shined. The FZ150 even today is a great purchase and you can expect top notch images and video. If you want a great low light camera with excellent bokeh, than consider the FZ200, the current successor to the FZ150.

Before buying this camera I tried other 3 different cameras and I found out that this was the best choice even though the optical zoom is not that the best among its class. I tried  Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ47 after that I tried Nikon P500 and finally I tried Canon SX40 HS. This last one I found it good with its good image quality, an enormous 35x zoom range, plenty of features but the overall, Panasonic DMC-FZ150K was the best of all.The FZ150 wins because of a very few extra features: a faster maximum burst rate, extra manual control including RAW capture, and a slightly higher-resolution LCD, to name the most obvious. Their image quality is very similar and they almost handle equally well.While the FZ150 comes out ahead in my choice, it's really too close to call, a toss-up at best. Hands-on, experienced photographers who are looking for a superzoom should side with the FZ150 for its extra manual control and, for sports photographers, the better stabilization. More casual shooters might be wooed by the SX40's longer zoom and cheaper price--it's understandable, though I'd still  much recommend the FZ150 most of the time.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best ever!", "Author": "CS in Colorado", "ReviewID": "R1MV1OKWLRIMNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought my earlier long zoom Panasonics were great cameras. Well, they can't hold a candle to the FZ150.  The speed of this camera is amazing.  Start-up is fast, focus is quick, and shutter lag is non-existant not to mention as many as 12 pictures per second.  I have found the tilting LCD screen much more useful than I had expected and that alone is worth the extra cost over the FZ47.  The most important thing, of course, is image quality and I can only describe that as excellent.  Detail is extremely well rendered and I've found no fault with color and light control.  The lens reach isn't as long as some rivals, but the extra 32X digital iZoom expands the reach and loses no apparant detail.  I acquired the available adapter to enable use of my old Olympus B300 telephoto which works perfectly with the FZ150 giving me a lens reach of around 1000mm equivalent. The FZ150's lens is also threaded--some others are not--so I can use a polarizing filter. I haven't even gotten into the video portion of this camera which is supposed to be great as well.I don't think it gets better in this category of camera. Of course I wish it was smaller and lighter, but I doubt that's possible with this level of functionality and photo quality and it's way better for me than a DSLR with lenses.  My FZ8 is still in the house as my wife's preferred camera.  It is smaller and weighs much less, but I haven't even had the thought of grabbing it instead of the FZ150.

My initial impression upon opening the package was that the camera had a rather plastic and cheap feel to it compared to the Canon SX40. However, after using it now for a number of weeks, it feels great in my hands and any question of build quality is forgotten - this is a fine camera.Physically, it is easy to hold. The right hand grip is nice and deep to really let you get your fingers around it, even with my large hands. The controls are well placed and there are a nice selection of dedicated buttons so you don't always have to dril down through the electronic menus.Speaking of the electronic menus, there are a lot  of them. They are not as intuitive as the menus on the Canon cameras but they are not difficult to get used to. After a few nights of reading the manual while playing with the controls and menus I felt very familiar with where to find what I wanted.I heavily researched this against the competing Canon before purchasing. One of my requirements was an actual viewfinder. Not only is using the lcd screen innacurate and difficult to use (especially in sunlight), but it also uses more battery power. This Panasonic has a very nice electronic viewfinder. Itis larger than the one on the Canon, but is the same reolution. It is clear, bright and easy to read with a diopter adjustment that realy helps for folks who wear glasses. For those that prefer to use the lcd screen it is large, bright and is hi resolution - also it is fully articulated for positioning however you want. Great for getting over the crowd for those sorts of shots.The camera offers full manual control for those that want it. I like to use the many built in modes. It excels in the number of \"scene\" modes available. It especially offers some nice nightime modes for capturing thos low light situations.It offers better/more burst shooting options than the Canon and again, you don't have to search through menus to find it - it ha s a dedicated button.For low light situations the camera takes fine pictures even without the flash. There is a built in pop up flash that is certainly adequate. For more light there is a dedicated hot shoe if you want to use an auxilary flash.The video capabilities are quite nice. I've only shot a little test footage to try it out but it seems very good. You can shoot at a high frame rate so when played back at normal speed it's in slow motion. Also you can take still pictures while shooting video, albeit at a lower resolution.Like most cameras today, the only printed manual is a smal quick-start booklet. Yes, it will get you shooting but little else. The detailed manual is provided as a PDF on a cd. This is OK if you want to load it on an iPad or smart phone but it's not convenient otherwise. However, i found a place online (manualsink), that you can purchase printed manuals for a lot of cameras and this is one of them. Sure, it cost about $15 but it is invaluable to have a printed manual.  Being able to flip back and forth between references is incredibly useful.I purchased this particular camera for a trip to Iceland next year to see the Northern Lights. If succesful, i'm confident that I'll be able to capture some nice photos. To that end I also purchased an Oben 1420 tripod with a BA-1 ball head, needed for those long exposure niht shots.I'm very happy with htis purchase.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic was the right choice for me", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "RLDRXSFK76SAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a travel camera with a long zoom so trying to decide between FZ150 and Nikon P510.

It has great performance, an excellent feature set, nice ergonomics, a serviceable viewfinder, a nice LCD on back, RAW shooting, a great video mode, a pretty good built-in flash. It is probably the most polished superzoom I have used and really is a pleasant camera to shoot with.When I first reviewed this camera, I noted mediocre image quality. Admittedly, this was a rush to judgement. The truth is that the FZ150 is capable of taking some very nice photos if you are willing to play around with the settings. If you just just iA (intelligent Auto) in all your photos, then I don't think you'll be all that impressed. But shooting manually and/or shooting RAW will get you some very nice photos. The photos might benefit from a little sharpening... but otherwise, detail capture is good, exposure is good. Color accuracy is spot on. It's really the best you could ask for given this class of camera.Autofocus performance is excellent. It is really is amazing how far these bridge cameras have come in terms of performance over the past couple of years. Shot-to-shot times are good. The menu system is pretty easy to understand and navigate. Although Panasonic packs so many features into this camera, that you probably won't understand all of its capabilities without reading the manual first.The LCD on back is of decent quality. Although like most, you have to crank up the brightness in the display settings for best viewing in direct sunlight. The EVF is a distinct improvement over previous Panasonic superzooms. Though I wouldn't really call it great though. It is usable. While this camera is constructed well, it feels a little more plasticky than its predecessors. But that also makes it a little more light-weight.The video mode on this camera is excellent. A great choice if you want a budget camera that does double duty for still and video.

It even comes with an external microphone jack, which is a nice touch.The Panasonic Lumix FZ150 is a great camera that will appeal to wide range of folks.

I haven't tried everything yet, but I mostly like what I have tried so far.The first thing I noticed on the camera was a real on/off switch, NOT a button! Love that. Then I noticed the lens was threaded for filters, just like a \"real\" camera. Nice thing is, it's 52mm, which is the filter size of my old 35mm camera, so I had a UV filter ready to be used. I like the view finder, I sometimes prefer to use same, and it's optically compensated. The digital display is large and clear and can be swiveled in various directions, making it easy to get those not-head-on shots. And when it's not being used, it can be flipped around so it's protected in transit. It can shoot RAW format which, while I rarely need it, is definitely nice to have for certain photos. Ditto for its 3D ability. It has all sorts of high-speed options and you can choose how long (or not at all) you want an image to display after you take the shot.I've found only a few annoyances so far. The big one is the (now standard) lack of a real manual. Hard to believe, Panasonic, but not everyone has a computer! And no computer is as handy to carry in my pocket as a manual would be. The other annoying thing is there's no play-only setting to look at your photos. In other words, you must power up the camera in record mode, have the lens extend and then press a button to switch to play mode. This extra in and out wastes battery power. Minor annoyances are interface related. The camera comes with a USB cable but it's too short to be very practical.

It also takes very high quality HD video. If your desire is to post process still images on your computer, it can make that route much more effective, by shooting in RAW format, which preserves vastly more image information for post processing. Very few point and shoot cameras can do that.If you don't need a lot of features, or top image and video quality in a small point and shoot camera, you can get something simple and less for less money. The FZ-47 loses some features, and is a bargain at the street price of about $270.  Many would be happy with a $150 camera today.  The FZ-150 is a camera for those who want the best in its class, and are willing to spend the price and the effort to get that and make use of it. It is arguably the best 1/2.3 sensor camera made.SPECIFICS:  The FZ-150 has so many features that everyone will have their particular favorites.  Some of mine are:Excellent image and video quality for a point and shoot.Excellent zoom range from very wide to close telephoto.A variety of features that enhance the ability to take pictures in low light or at night.  Powerful flash for a point and shoot, with the ability to add an even more powerful flash as an accessory.The ability to adjust pretty much anything if you want, or to select intelligent auto, and have the camera do it all for you.  Some people have complained about the complexity, but this camera is only as complicated as you want it to be.An auxiliary eye level viewfinder, which is useful in sunlight, or for holding the camera with more steadiness.The ability to shoot in RAW format, which makes post processing images in your computer much more effective, by preserving far more image information than is in the usual JPEG format saved by most all point and shoots.  With difficult high contrast subjects or in difficult lighting, shooting RAW and post processing can make the difference between a mediocre image and a showstopper.  By the way, if you shoot JPEGS, note that being able to adjust various things on the camera, as this one permits you to, beats trying to patch things up later with software.The ability to take fast bursts of images to capture well framed pictures of rapidly moving subjects.A large and clear LCD screen which has adjustable brightness, and can be tilted and rotated for better visibility in sunlight, or when taking high or low angle pictures.All this comes at a price, of course.  This is arguably the best 1/2.3 sensor camera (which is what most point and shoots use) made.  You don't get the Rolls Royce of the class at a bargain price.  But, if you can do without a few features you can get 90% of the camera as an FZ-47, for about $270.  There are many detailed comparisons of the two available on the web, so I'll skip over that.If you delve into the many features of this camera things do get complex, and some, such as white balance, require some study for most people.  But you don't have to go there, it's all your choice.Highly recommended if you want the best, and are willing to pay for it.  And if you want the advanced features.  To get to significantly better images you need a larger sensor camera, like a 4/3 or a DSLR.  But, because of optical physics, those large sensor cameras cannot match the zoom range of this camera without a number of expensive and heavy lenses.  Which makes the price of an FZ-150 look not so bad, after all.For many, something less will meet your needs.  If you never print anything but 4X6s and view pictures unmagnified on a computer you don't need the image quality.  If you don't care to adjust things, something simpler and cheaper would probably be better for you.  You shouldn't get this camera simply because of the very high ratings, you should get it because you want what it offers.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect!", "Author": "D.

Hudson \"Fatherhonda\"", "ReviewID": "RUWHIBEG7VG40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for nearly a month.  I bought it to replace a Panasonic FZ-28 because I was having difficulty following the action in sporting events using the fastest full-frame (10 megapixel) burst mode with refocusing between shots, which was about 2 frames per second.  The screen freezes momentarily after each shot, and 2 fps was too slow to allow me to pan successfully.  The FZ-150 has a 5 fps full-frame mode (12 megapixels) with refocusing between shots, and that has proven to be fast enough for most, though not all, situations.  If I were in a situation where refocusing is not important, the FZ-150 offers 12 fps with the full 12-megapixel frame, and I may try that in the future.Eating memory with the burst mode is not a problem -- I got a 32-gig card.I like the frame selection feature in 1080p video in which you can take a 2.5-megapixel photo without interrupting the video.Battery life is impressive.  I bought some extra non-Panasonic-branded batteries, based on my experience with the FZ-28, for which 3 batteries equalled a full-day of shooting.  It turns out the FZ-150 can go a full day (in my kind of usage) on just one battery.  The non-Panasonic batteries have the \"chip\" which allows the camera to read their state of charge.  I got them on Amazon from Big Mike's Electronics.  About $18 versus $47 for the Panasonic branded battery, including shipping charges for both.A downside is that the camera takes time to digest big photo bursts -- it says it is writing to the card.  This takes seveal seconds during which the camera's capablities are reduced.  It just seems to me to take too long -- my card is a class 10, so I don't think the card's speed is the limiting factor -- and I blame it on the camera's bufferEven with this downside, I give the camera 5 stars.

Should \"you\" purchase one of these Panasonics? Only you can decide.I looked at and tested three other major players, I got spoiled using a Canon G2 which helped me with the rotating LCD Screen, Then in 2005 wanted to upgrade and ended up getting a Minolta A200 because of the rotating screen and found it had an awesome stabilizer.

I found a few things that I may have read about but didn't really think about until using it. I hope this helps anyone interested in this camera.Zoom - 24x... Okay, so this is what is advertised and is... but if you allow the camera to... it will zoom digitally to 96x. Does it have problems at 96x? Of course it does! Like it is sometimes hard to hold and focus at 96x. It's hard to keep on the subject if you move a little. If something closer gets in the way the focus can get blurry... But... If you use a little patience and work with the camera... WOW! I took pictures of a full moon (NOT at full darkness) on automatic settings at full 96x and hard the camera hand held but resting my hands on top of my grill (It wasn't hot) and shot the moon... I could not believe the detail.And then there is the \"color\" of shots... sometimes it doesn't look like what I see... but then this happened with every camera I have ever owned and used. That's why they make software. Now all my pictures appear great.One last item... for now... I hate the video camera features of this camera. The microphones are too sensitive. I took a picture holding the camera about waist level as I was walking across a covered bridge and you can hear my breathing clear as a bell. Forget stealth recording! And then there is the matter of Video quality. I have a Canon Digital Video Camera that gathers dust now.

This camera actually does more than I really needed it to do.  98% of my pictures and videos were sharp and clear.  The other 2% could have been my fault, who knows.  One scare... it was cold enough overnight (just below freezing) that the camera was not really responding early in the a.m.  I was freaking out that it was broke and I just started my vacation (you cant get another camera while in the African bush!).  An hour or so later after I got it warmed up, it started working fine.  I actually started sleeping with it in my bed until the night temperatures warmed up.The zoom was easy to use and the auto-focus was a lifesaver.  My only gripe, and its small, is that sometimes the camera would focus on something in the foreground instead of my intended subject (e.g. a bush that was a bit in front of an animal I was trying to photograph).  A couple of time I had to put the camera on manual focus to get my intended shot, but this was very seldom.Video recording was a snap!  All you really had to do was remember which direction of the zoom lever was zoom-in and which was zoom-out.  Of course, I guessed wrong many times...  especially early on.  But that wasn't the camera's fault, it took great videos.The bigger the viewing screen, the better my pics & videos look.  They seemed \"ok\" on the little camera LCD.  I was excited they looked even better after I got them onto my laptop when I got home.  But they were really awesome looking when I plugged my laptop into my 60\" plasma screen!!  Wow!

There are far less chromatic aberrations(color fringes)and very little noise in low light or in shadow areas even at 400 and 800 ISO. This is most likely due to the quality of the lens and a better sensor. I miss the manual focus feature of my old FZ20 that actually had a focus ring like older 35 mm cameras. The specifications say the FZ150 has manual focus, but in reality it is a digital feature that you can control with a button, not a manual focus ring, which for me would be more intuitive. The flip out LCD viewer is sometimes annoying because it gets in the way of where I would like to position my camera for a good shot. The camera is a bit smaller and lighter than my earlier models, and for me I would prefer larger and heavier, which keeps it more steady for telephoto shots and video. The position of the buttons on the right side are a nuisance when holding it because they lie directly under my thumb and I am always hitting either DISPLAY, VIEW or MENU by mistake. I didn't have this problem with earlier miodels. I have to retrain myself. The video features are much improved over earlier models too. They had low resolution video, and you could not zoom once switched into video mode. You had to zoom in to your subject before turning on the video recording.

Its simply a very good camera in a very portable package: no extra lenses, minimal bulk and weight, and a very good image stability system. With raw capture and three customizable shooting settings you get to have full control over your images. Also exposure bracketing, 3D picture mode, slo mo video, and many other features add to the fun of the camera.Ok, so there are a few minor shortcomings:  a larger, more easily operated rear thumbwheel would be good.  The one on the camera is a bit slippery (wheel indents are small and rounded) and can be hard to turn, especially with cold hands. The functions accessed and adjusted with the thumb wheel are well chosen and for that reason the thumb wheel should operate a bit better. The articulating screen is very bright and clear but can be a bit difficult to open when mounted to a tripod (I frequently leave the screen closed to avoid damage or scratches). I added a small flap of self-adhesive fabric (velcro loop side) to the back of the screen for a grab handle. Also it would be nice to access the SD card without removing the tripod plate. The lens cap inner pinch points are quite slippery, I added small pieces of self adhesive velcro (hook side) to improve the grip. I'd also like a bulb setting for long exposures and an IR remote control.  But really these are all minor points, this is such an excellent camera as is, and I know I'll enjoy it for many years.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just about perfect!", "Author": "Rastus", "ReviewID": "R3DFA1KQ2MMJJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about 4 months ago to replace an earlier version (FZ28).  I also have a Nikon D90 that I've considered my go-to camera when I want the best possible outcome.  To be honest, the only way I could justify the purchase of the FZ150 was for the video because I'd gotten to the point that I rarely used the FZ28.  As for the video, it's outstanding on this camera...I would have to think it's just about as good as a dedicated camcorder plus you get an excellent still-shot camera.  I've been very impressed with the output this camera produces.  In fact, in good light, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between this camera and my DSLR.  In low light, it's not DSLR quality, but it's far better than any other compact I've used.  The auto focus is very quick and there's very little shutter lag.  I bought a strap  Speedster Camera Strap  that looks/works/feels better than the Panasonic strap.  Also, the lens cap is improved from the FZ28 but I still find it somewhat annoying so I just use the included lens hood and leave the cap off.  I highly recommend this camera.  I don't have any complaints but I would like to see the following changes/additions to future models:1.  Larger EVF with sensor to turn on when needed as in the GH2.2.  Ability to zoom manually as well as powered.  The power zoom is great for video but manual would be much better/quicker for stills.3.  Dedicated switches on the body for functions like metering mode, continuous shooting mode, etc. (again, like the GH2)4.  Larger sensor...I know, it's not likely to happen...if this camera did have a 4/3 or APS size sensor, I think it would make most other consumer cameras obsolete.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "G.

The field of view is small so the slightest movement can make the subject bounce.60 fps on 1920x1080 progressive, up to 2 hours on 16Gb SD card in AVHD. Can shoot MP4The HD video is awesome. I like that you can also use special effects such as tilt shift (miniature) and Sepia et al, in Movie mode.

On the plus side, the camera functions well and reliably.  The images I have obtained are as good as the ones I get with the Nikon D300.  In parfticular I like the inherent color saturation of the Lumix.  After importing the shot into Photoshop, very little manipulation is necessary to \"improve\" the image.  Resolution is good and the picture remains sharp even after some cropping.  As a back-up camera, I feel that I made the right choice.  One of the features that I find very useful is the EV function in association with the built-in Histogram.  The Histogram shows the distribution of the light spectrum of the scene as I see it.  If the exposure has to be adjusted (EV) the Histogram shift as I make the adjustment.  All that before I even take the picture.  In essence, there is no guessing as to what the image is going to look like.  That function alone is worth the camera as a whole.  I also like the Quick Menu which allows me to make changes \"on the fly\" as it were.  Another feature that I find valuable is the extreme close-up that it can handle.  When shooting small objects that is a very valuable.On the negative side, I am a bit dismayed with the eye level viewer.  It is cluttered with too much information.  The color rendition through the view finder does not represent the actual image.  The option is to take the shot using the LED viewer.  But that is awkward, particularly if one is trying to shoot vertically.  Another things that seems strange still is the extreme light weight of the camera.  This is in sharp contrast to the Nikon D300 which is heavy.  The lightness makes the hand-held shooting very unstable.  My recommendation is to use a tripod in most instances with a wire remote shutter.  Others have mentioned quick release plate blocks access to the battery, memory card compartment; not the best design.All in all, I like the camera.  I will keep it as a good backup.

Obviously low light/backlight/stage light performance is critical.  The two camera's I was considering were this one, and the new Nikon P510.  Given it's intended use, I went with the FZ150 for the four following reasons...it has a hot shoe for mics & external flashes, much better video performance, a threaded lens for filters & special lens attachments like a telephoto lens or polarizing filter.  From what I gather, the P510 may take better still pics in some situations.  But the FZ150 is more verstaile with much better video, more features, and more functions.Here is what I DON\"T like so far.  The ONLY way to turn the flash off & on is to open & close the flash boom...that sux!  You can, if it's already open, and you're in some of the manual modes go into the menu and control flash & type.  But if the flash boom is closed, even if you have the flash set to on in the menu...it will not pop up & fire.  All this makes for missed opportunities, and more time fiddling with the camera instead of using it.  I'm used to a single external button to manage the flash no matter what mode I'm in.Another cumbersome thing is the thumbwheel control...it's very difficult to use.  I've also noticed that some settings in the P Mode will effect how it shoots in auto, (IA), such as color balance.  So again, this adds fiddling time...and possible missed opportunities.  I'm used to Auto being totally independent of any other settings accept being able to turn the flash off with the press of a button.Some of the GOOD points are it's extremely fast when shooting pics, it's very sexy, macro shots are amazing, landscape shots are amazing, night shots of skylines & buildings are awesome even when shooting by hand, indoor shooting is equally as impressive.  Lighting does sometimes have a yellowish look to it unless you change the color balance, but at least that's quick & easy.  With a hot shoe, ext mic jack, threaded lens, video capabilty & features...you will not find a more versatile camera.  And it seems to do it all fairly well.  In short, my issues are with function set-up, not performance.  I'm not sure yet...I need another shoot or three.  But I think I can really love this camera!!! :-)", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for those who want the camera to do all the work", "Author": "ontheroadjg", "ReviewID": "R1Q2KMGIYEREMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the camera about a week.  Previously had the Lumix FZ50 and have really enjoyed the features it offered.  This model is incredible.  We usually are taking landscapes and as we spend a lot of time in the San Juan Islands, WA, sealife is our standard.  The stills are easily taken with mode option made so easy it encourages you to try.  The ease of using the video obsoletes our camcorder.  The quality of either stills or videos is like real life.  While walking around the airport where we live, I spotted a unique WWII plane.  Although I had gloves on, I fumbled pulling out the camera, advancing the telescopic lens to chase him down the runway, and got a burst of 3 pictures, which even showed the pilot in the cockpit. I was impressed.The camera is smaller than the FZ50, which is what my wife wanted.  She also wanted to take pictures of the bald eagles which we see quite frequently this time of year in the islands, but the telescopic feature of the FZ50 blurred when taken at full optic range.  This model does not.Inside pictures using auto take very good pictures, either still or video without additional lighting.  It appears to be able to take low light pictures but does start showing some noise when there is no outside light.This camera feels just right for doing the rigorous outdoor life we enjoy.

Having said that when you purchase the camera make sure you take adequate test shots during the \"return period\"  covering the entire range wide angle to telephoto, as there are a few reports on problems with individual cameras.All photos were handheld (tripods and bean bags are impractical in a stand up safari van), still shots only, viewfinder only, maximum resolution format 12M, and iA mode, and I would say the bulk of the shots were at the high end of the focal range 400-800mm (35mm equivalent), except for close up`s, large groups of animals or landscapes.  The reason it worked so well is that the camera is lightweight and small and can be held in one hand, the other hand is needed to hang on while the van is moving and one is standing up. In a typical Toyota safari van with pop top that holds 8 people and a driver there isn't much room even with 3-4 photographers on board, I`d recommend 2-3 is a good maximum for photographers and it helps if one passenger is spotting with binoculars along with the driver. A typical van charge per day is $100 including the driver so you may want to splurge and just have your small group in one van.. Headroom under the pop top is fairly generous, if you are under 6' 4\" it`s OK, but really tall people will have a problem.  The other reason the FZ150 worked so well is that the combination of iA mode, fast AF, fast zoom, allows rapid composition and focusing, and I credit using the viewfinder mode with being able to produce sharp images at or near the maximum zoom where I think the FZ150 camera image stabilization, excellent though it is, is at it's limits for handheld shots. Holding the FZ150 out in front and using the LCD isn't very stable at all and just isn't going to work as well in this situation. I find the FZ150 viewfinder is quite useable, and essential for safari photographs. It allows one to hold the camera against ones forehead which is a very stable position.  When holding the camera one handed and bouncing around in a van it's easy to press buttons near the thumb rest, but after some practice I could avoid this. Initially I powered the camera off-on  many times to restart it.When not being used I put the FZ150 into my rip off's belt pouch, so a large camera bag could be avoided-I don't know where you can put it anyway in a safari van except on the floor.  The best plan on camera cards is to take a bunch of them and change them each day even if not full, this way if your camera is stolen the loss will be minimized. One option to improve the probability of success might be to use burst mode and use the available card space to get multiple images on each shot.  The used cards need to be stored somewhere safe -not in a wallet or camera bag or any other bag. Also make sure to follow general guidelines on health (vaccinations, sunblock, water filtering, mosquito repellant) and security (make copies of passport and credit cards, don't carry passport around with you,have safe place for money, etc) because you won't be taking many photos if you are sick, lost all of your money, or waiting in line to get a new passport.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best SuperZoom Camera for the Money", "Author": "InStitches49", "ReviewID": "R1YQSOIHPJPNMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already have a Nikon D3000 DSLR and love it but wanted a superzoom camera to take on those times when I didn't want the heavier DSLR and the lens attachments.

With the hot shoe, flip out screen and raw file shooting and excellent video its a very flexible camera. But it not a DSLR replacement yes for its sensor size it produces excellent still pictures between iso between 100 to 800. I bought three cameras for testing the Panasonic LX5, the FZ150 and the Sony Nex5n .I kept the Sony Nex5n its 16mp aps-c sensor its photo and video quality blow away any small ccd or cmos sensor camera. I was looking for a more compact dslr replacement for my old canon xt and Nex5n fits the bill nicely. I like the zoom for fz150 but I want better photo quality over zoom power . But for someone looking for a \"bridge super zoom camera\" I think the FZ 150 is the best in class . It's picture quality is excellent for a small sensor cmos (best Ive ever used) for its price, FZ150 has very fast camera focus, loads of exposure controls, external mic, etc...(almost as fast as the more expensive nex5n). For me I like the Nex5n better. But for it price point the fz150 excellent camera for a family wanting a all in one still/video package with lots of zoom and excellent fairly fast lens  or traveler looking for all in one camera and not interested in carrying extra lenses this is a great camera. That why even though I returned my fz150 I still give it five stars for it class of camera its excellent just dont think it will replace a camera with a aps-c size sensor but it will give the 12mp 4:3 sensor cameras a good run for the money.

Using burst mode at 12 frames/sec, I got some extaordinary shots of the Blue Angels, and the videos I shot were also very good, including the sound. The same trip afforded some night shots and videos, all showing me that my money was well spent. The 24X zoom is incredible, though you'll want to use a tripod in many instances to hold the camera steady. Macro shots are impressive. Everyone to whom I've shown the photos and videos has been impressed and wants one of these cameras now.I think the image quality is very good. I did set the ISO limit to 800 max, as I had read that image quality suffers at higher ISO ratings. At airshows, with my old 35mm SLRs, I always had to overexpose 2 stops to get the planes adequately exposed, but I did not find that necessary with the DMC-FZ150. The auto focus is fast, and I have not yet had to wait for it to lock onto the subject. It is light, easy to handle with one hand, and comfortable to grip.My only complaints with this camera are minor. 1) The camera does not stitch the photos in panorama assist mode - you have to do it afterwards with the included software.

THE FOLLOWING WAS WRITTEN IN FEBRUARY 2012Update with info on RW2 (Panasonic RAW)--2/18/12In case anyone else is having problems working with RW2, I offer these findings.  My main purpose with all of the viewing progrrams is (1) to be able to see what the images are, delete the bad ones, and (2) get the good ones into JPEG to archive, or into TIFF or PNG for PP with PhotoShop CS4 or PSE.-- Xnview: didn't measure up.Color of larger thumbnail/preview at bottom is washed out, almost gray.Open the file: a dialog box says: \"This picture will be converted to RGB with 8bits per component.\"Click OK. Open image. Image is washed out, dimensions are shown as 4016x3016x24, 14.33MB.Save as RAW: icon shows Adobe RAW, but if I open it in CS4 or PSE6 the result is abstract gray smears.  Forget this route.Save as JPEG: Image is washed out, dimensions are 4016x3016, 969KB!--FastStone: love it for other file types, but not RW2.Full-sized RW2 images are beyond washed-out; they have a serious color cast that is very difficult to correct. There also appears to be detail degradation.--Irfanview: with extreme highlights, requires a very dark setting.In an image containing breaking waves in sunlight the brightest parts of the foam are totally blown out. (This does not occur with FastStone in spite of the other issue.)  One fix: Options>Properties/Settings... check only \"camera whilte balance;\" set Brightness to 0.5 (default is 1.0). This eliminated blown highlights and didn't appear to degrade color.--RawTherapee.  Works well, but clunky.Seems to avoid the above problems.  I don't like the UI as much, but it provides true color and luminance, and a variety of Save As... choices.RawTherapee allows viewing of an image that retains the visual characteristics of the original RW2 image, shows the original pixel dimensions, and will save in a variety of formats at original pixel dimensions without perceptible change in visual characteristics.--Adobe DNG Converter: the key to a solution.Not a viewer, but gets RW2 files into a more universal format.NOTE: If you convert to DNG, viewing with some viewers may be misleading.  Apparently the JPEG embedded in DNG is \u00bc size, rather than the \u00bd size used by RW2.  As a result, images on screen will appear blurry with some viewers.--Windows Viewer (requires DNG codec; see below): did the trick.Ended up doing the best job for the purpose stated above.  Windows Viewer gives a quick way to view 1/2 size DNG images, clearly and with no visible chroma or luminance issues. (The blown highlight issue persisted when viewing DNG with other viewers.) Unlike programs that open in half size and save in half size, with Winviewer you are one click away from opening a full-size image in Photoshop (CS or PSE), with no change in visual attributes.  The codec is quickly downloaded and installed.If you want the codec, it's at: [...]............Finally I was able to get the FZ150 from Amazon after flooding wiped out the factory in Thailand last fall.  All the shots described below were hand-held.  All shots were ISO 100 unless noted.After using the camera, it is much better than I expected.  One reason I bought it was that a number of camera review sites called it the best superzoom available today.  One site had the Canon SX40 rated as #1, then the next week they tested the FZ150 and it outranked the Canon.  General consensus (by actual testing) seems to be that the Canon has slightly better IQ in terms of detail and sharpness, but the FZ150 is stronger in a number of other areas.My observations (all still shots; I will discuss video when I've had a chance to use it):I have some standard shots I take at full zoom, including structures 1300 and 1600 yards away, and shots of car license plates at distances ranging from 285 to 500 yards.--At 1300 and 1600 yards using full zoom, you can count the roof tiles on a house if you enlarge the image on the computer.--At about 300 yards, you can take a picture that allows you to easily read the license plate on a car.  At 500 yards, you can easily read street signs.  This compares amazingly well to a DSLR using 300mm zoom.--Color is phenomenal right out of the box; very natural.--CA/PF was minimal even at full zoom; only slight traces in high-contrast reflective areas (chrome bumper, in sunlight, against a black car), and even then not noticeable unless the image was magnified.--RAW is a huge plus.--Images are clean up through 8x10, and in many cases 11x14 or a bit larger.  If you crop and/or enlarge beyond that, there's more noise than I would like, but keep the ISO low (100-200) and you're OK.--Zoom is very smooth and quiet, and AF works well during zoom.--Image stabilization is phenomenal: full zoom, hand-held, with subjects almost a mile away resulted in images with zero camera shake at a shutter speed of 1/500.--AF is excellent, and actually performed better in complex visual environment than some DSLRs.  So far, no hunting.  I will have to see how this works in a flat light or low light environment.--Burst is great.  I prefer 5.5fps over 12fps because for birds, seals, breaking waves, and surfing shots (99% of the action I shoot) 12fps is overkill.  At 5.5fps I get about 3 seconds of action before the buffer fills and the camera starts to slow down.  I haven't timed the write time, but it isn't bad.  The entire burst mode certainly compares favorably with some DSLRs.  RAW files are bigger, so the buffer and write time get in the way a bit more, but the shooting speed is the same.Operation:--The dial (for aperture and shutter speed) is a bit small and a bit hard to turn.  Kind of cheap, actually, which is out of character for this otherwise very nicely-built and well-finished camera.--A tripod mount will block the batter/memory card door.--The EVF is pretty low quality (flickery)--but a whole lot better than nothing.  You can use it while wearing sunglasses.  It's satisfactory.--The articulated screen, which can be folded against the camera to protect the surface when not in use, is outstanding.--The Quick Menu, accessed by a simple touch of the button (which doubles as a delete button in the playback mode), is very convenient.--EV and ISO buttons are a great feature.--Video button is a great feature.--Pany makes sure you don't delete anything by mistake: you have to go through several choices and confirmations before delete happens.--CAUTION: Photoshop and MSoft do not recognize the FZ150's brand of RAW.  And many folks don't want the hassle of using the Pany softward.  Luckily, a free program called FastStone does handle FZ150 RAW.  You can open the image in FastStone; from there you can either do PP directly in FastStone or save the image as JPEG, PNG, etc. and then, with one click, open it in PhotoShop. NOTE: PhotoShop will tell you that the image does not have a color profile associated with it, and will ask you if you want to assign a profile.  You will get the best results if you select \"print\" profile.  Colors will be much deeper and richer.BOTTOM LINE: I am amazed at how good this camera is for a hopped-up P&S; with a tiny (1/2.3in) sensor.  I knew the feature set was great, but after buying an FZ100 and returning it because of abysmal IQ, I wasn't sure that the new sensor had fixed the problem.  It has.Additional information: I just took another of my standard test shots, of palm trees, tile roof and the ocean.  The tile roof is 400 yards away, the far palm tree about 440 yards.  The ocean is about 650 yards.  There is quite a mix of colors and textures.  Hand held, full zoom, f/4.2@1/500 using default color setting, converted to JPEG for uploading purposes.  I am frankly surprised at the IQ and resolution of these images.  They are better than some of the very same scene that I have shot with various DSLRs with kit lenses.  They are slightly soft due to lower resolution of the camera, but they do not display any blotchiness or distortion or PF, unlike some DSLRs with kit lens.  And the softness can be reduced with minimal sharpening.  (Before you tell me how kit lenses are not a real test, let me remind you that the lens on the FZ150 is a kit lens.)More later, after I've had a chance to do some action shooting outdoors in more challenging conditions.2/16/12Just took a variety of hand-held shots around the ocean.  All shots were ISO 100.  The results:--Native color/WB is excellent, very true to life.  If you want to make colors more vivid or extreme, it's easy to do with a number of settings.--Detail is very good.  At full zoom, things like scaffolding or venetian blinds are captured very clearly.  If you're printing up to about 11x14 or thereabouts, you should be happy with the results.--For extreme high contrast in bright light (such as white foamy waves against a deep blue ocean), to avoid highlight blowout it's a good idea to shoot at -1EV.  You can get good results anwhere between f/5.2 @ 1/500sec and f/6.3 @ 1/800sec; for consistency it's better to expose for the highlights and use the latter setting.--AF on flying birds was phenomenal.  Very quick and accurate.  You can get more resolution and better IQ with a DSLR, for sure.  On the other hand, many DSLR users report frustration with shots that are out of focus.  A soft shot is better than no shot, and so far I have had zero shots out of focus.  Keep in mind that pelicans, cormorants and gulls flying along the shore come in sight, pass by, and disappear very quickly.  There is no time to get set up for each shot; you have to pick your settings and be prepared for something very much like skeet shooting when a subject appears.  The FZ150 is very good in this regard.  Surfing shots are very easy by comparison.--Zero PF so far in high contrast situations at the beach.  A major plus.--My subjective impression was that in burst mode, shots were softer even though AF was on.  Not bad, but not as good as those captured by the larger-sensor (2/3in) Fuji S100fs in burst mode.  All the shots were taken between 1/500 and 1/800, which should have been enough to avoid blur due to motion; it's the same shutter speed range I always used with the Fuji.--The camera is small enough and light enough that you don't feel it to be a burden, unlike DSLRs or big superzooms.--Took some shots indoors at the supermarket while waiting for my coffee to grind.  Hand-held, f/2.8 @ 1/40sec, ISO 100, no flash.  It's not the brightest interior in the world, but the images were clear; you could easily read the closer labels, etc.  No blurring, but the images were a bit soft.  Exposure was perfect.  No complaints.  My subjective impression is that this is a better outdoor camera.--Bottom line outdoors: DSLRs and 2/3in sensors will get more detail, less softness, and higher IQ in most cases.  But the FZ150 is totally satisfactory for prints up to about 11x14 or so, the burst is outstanding, AF is great, and because the camera is less than half the weight of a DSLR or a Fuji 2/3in, it's a camera you will have with you.  Which means you will get more shots, and more good shots..............THE FEATURE SETI bought an FZ100 when it was a fairly new item.  It had all the features anyone could want, except one: it did not generate good images.  I sent it back; thank you Amazon, for standing behind the product and taking it back if it isn't up to snuff.  Even Panasonic had to recognize that the FZ100 was not a winner.  The FZ150 has a totally different sensor, with fewer megapixels to generate noise.  The IQ is much better.What's to like about this camera?  Panasonic is making one of the few, if not the only, P&S; cameras with all the small features that enable serious picture taking.--Front threads (52mm) for filters.  This means being able to use CPL and other filters for great effects without having to resort to add-ons, apapters, etc.  The more you get into photography (especially in high-contrast or glare situations), the more you'll appreciate this.--Articulated LCD.  This is truly convenient for odd angles, so you don't have to get down in the dirt or climb a tree to get the low or high shot, or twist yourself into a pretzel for that perspective shot around the corner.  Also good to avoid screen glare.--EVF.  The articulated LCD is great, but there are times, especially with bright sun or long range with full zoom, that you'll see and frame your subject far more easily with the EVF than the screen.--Serious continuous mode.  12fps (no AF) or 5.5fps (AF) at full resolution.  Lots of cameras tout fairly high burst rates; they don't promote the fact that this is only possible at very low resolution, like 3mp.--Decent buffer.  For many types of action shots, 5-6fps is adequate, so if you keep AF on and shoot JPEG at 5.5fps you can get several seconds of action before there's a slowdown.  Lots of cameras tout high burst speeds; they don't tout the fact that you only get 1 second of burst before the buffer is full.--RAW.  If you care about color, this is major.--Remote.  Less commonly used, perhaps, but very useful if you need to put your tripod in an awkward place, where it would be difficult to trigger the shutter by hand.  Also avoids tripod shake.--Hot shoe.  I never use one, but for many people, it's a must for better flash, etc.--Plenty of manual control, for getting the picture you want.In short, this camera has all the features of a good enthusiast DSLR, and some features that are lacking even on some DSLRs.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "BEST OVERALL for Vacations, Outings, Nature Scenery...", "Author": "J.

To be honest, though, I tried so many compact cameras up to the S100, XZ1, P300...and they all fail in the same situation: over ISO800 in ambient light - focus becomes fuzzy, and noise rises - maybe not so much at normal size viewing, but at almost any magnification.OUTDOORS, the FZ150 fears no competition.... The Nikon P510 and Canon SX40 are nice, but the FZ150 has everything they have and more : hot shoe, external mike input, HDMI output, USB 2.0 port, jpeg + RAW, beautiful clarity of zoom, excellent video, ability to adjust so many settings in PASM modes, very good viewfinder, and a fully articulated LCD.The mode dial has all the common SCN positions, so you rarely have to go into the LCD menu, when you are shooting in viewfinder mode, which I almost always use when outdoors.The mode dial also has a Movie setting, which I much prefer to the \"dedicated video button\". So many cameras have that button in such an inconvenient position that you practically have to be looking at it to make sure you are on it.There are many accessories available, even a true wireless remote, that when coupled with the articulated LCD, lets you take candid portraits and scenes without holding the camera to your face.Not even a DSLR costing 2 or 3 tmes the price can give you close-ups of scenery without extra investments in telephoto lenses. I know, I have a very fine Pentax K5 myself. The K5 would have to crop 300% to really be considered a telephoto camera, even after investing $500 in a decent 200mm lens. On top of the beautiful zoom ability, the FZ150 has very good macro also, which is another $500. Unless you plan to become a pro and sell your photos, the FZ150 is all you're gonna need outdoors and pretty much indoors.I like this camera more over time, not less over time, and that is the true measure of money well spent.Get the FZ150 for all around use, and you should be happy. But if you can afford it, get the FZ150 for travel and nature shots, and maybe the LX7 when on sale at $349 or less for a pocket cam and indoor specialist.

But I have physical limitations, often need a cane for walking - so I need a camera that is light and compact, not some DSLR camera with a honking big lens. I had had a previous Panasonic camera and been happy with it, so decided to upgrade to the FZ150 as it had all the features I needed in a compact size and a decent optical zoom.When I first got this camera I would have given it a 5 rating. It took amazing pictures. I got some great shots with the optical zoom. But then a few months ago the pictures weren't as good. They were never sharp or in focus. I kept thinking I was doing something wrong, and kept trying to fiddle with settings, hold the camera steadier. But finally realized that I could not be doing it wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME when I had taken excellent photos effortlessly before. So I went to the Panasonic website to search, and search and search. After HOURS of searching I found somewhere where I could submit a question to tech support which I did. And they wrote back and said my camera was out of warranty and I would have to pay to ship it to them and have it repaired.Of course this was only a few weeks after the warranty ended, and I realized that the camera had been failing well before the end of warranty. I just wasn't sure what was happening. So I debated for a while about did I want to pour more money into a camera that failed in less than a year.When I decided I wanted to pursue my options again I got frustrated. Though I searched for more hours I could no longer try the Q&A; site. I tried calling their tech support number number 5-6 times but despite multiple tries could never find a way to get past their VRU and talk to a live body- Just kept getting canned messages I tried their live chat but the chat rep could not help me at all and told me to just call the phone number I'd already fruitlessly tried.I am so fed up by the early failure and the inability to get any help that I would now rate this camera a one. But it still does take nice crisp photos as long as I don't use the optical zoom, so I did give it one additional star for that. But of course the optical zoom is the reason I bought it.

I prefer this over the Nikon L810.  A few hundred more, but worth every penny of it.Some of the features in scenes have not been implemented.

This is a great travel camera. Does it all and is light weight. Use of the flexable screen enabled me to get some intresting videos after putting the camera on an telescopic extender. The purchase shipment from Amazon was fast and easy.Cons: The only frustration with the camera came when I accidentally pushed the Burst mode button (which is easy to do as there are a lot of buttons) which then shuts off the forced flash function.

Furthermore it has 4 features I consider essential: a viewfinder, a fully articulated LCD, an adequate zoom (24x) and the ability to take pictures in rapid secession.  For the camera I selected a LowePro Edit 110 bag which comfortably holds the camera and its essential accessories and which can be carried by its handle, shoulder strap or velcro-attached belt loop.

I am not an expert photographer but have a successful you tube channel that makes enough to buy all new equipment every year if needed.  I was looking for upgrade options this year.... and honestly.... I am going to keep this camera for another year. I use this camera primarily for video and cameras in this price range with an external mic are very few and far between.  I think this may be why the resale value of this camera is so high.  You cant buy this camera new from amazon anymore and the used ones look like they are going for around $350. If you can find one in great shape for sub $300 I would jump on it but at $350 used I would just spend the extra $100 and get the lumix FZ-200, which is also a great camera and the successor to this one.  From a video only perspective you are not going to find a camera in this price range with an external mic that takes great video like the FZ-150 (except FZ-200).  Because of this the resale value of this camera is high and they are getting hard to come across used  at that.  If you don't already have one than you missed the boat on this one.  $350 for a 3 year old used camera that cost $400 new doesn't make sense.

It has been one of the handiest cameras I have ever had.  My next one will be a DSLR, but for now this fills the bill.  The reason I bought this particular one was that the reviews said that the colors were most accurate on this one.  (for the type of camera.)  I have found this to be true. I am an art student.  I like to work from photos, as I am not at the point yet where I can sketch something accurately from life.  Of course I do sketches, but I also like to get the final proportions for a major painting using photos as a reference.  (not to copy, just as a reference).  So the color is quite good.  also the telephoto lens is very nice and I have had very good luck photographing wildlife near my home (turkeys, deer).  So far I have only used it in the mode where the camera does all the work, but I would like to get to the point where I learn how to use its other modes.  I don't know how they would do.  I also have an upper-body disability and I need something extremely light-weight.  THis camera fills the bill in that regard too.  HIghly recommended.

Anyone with a child or pet that isn't sure if they what 1st rate photo's or video's.  The FZ150 excels at both. I've never purchased a Panasonic camera in my life and this camera has me questioning why?  What I like the most is the controls and their layout.  Besides the zoom located at the shutter button there's another zoom control on the left side of the camera body right where the lens is.  I find it much more convenient then the other zoom control.  What drew me to this camera was mostly the wide aperture its capable of.  You need a narrow field of view to create those beautiful shots with blurred backgrounds.  The larger aperture you have available the easier it is to achieve that effect. The other reason I chose this camera is the discount in pricing due to it being a couple of years old already.  Oh, and one more detail.  It produces amazing video and accepts an auxhcillarey microphone.  With the RAW file capability's I just had to have it considering that it is discounted quite often. I did buy it as separate components and after doing so would recommend you to buy a complete package.  A separate charger, cables, and other stuff that comes in the complete package ran me just about equal to the package price. This is a camera that should not become dated or outmoded for quite some time.  It has an ample zoom and the ability to shoot in many pre-programmed modes as well as a completely manual mode for some creative genius type stuff.

The large flexible LCD screen is great but I still like a viewfinder. Many of the other cameras in its class are bulkier, heavier, or lack some of the features I really like in this one. The only button on the back of the camera that I might accidently touch with my thumb while shooting is the \"\"playback\" button. The designers realized that and recessed the button slightly; good idea! Overall, this camera has a nice feel to it when shooting and the photos seem very crisp, with fine resolution. I've run some test shots with it and I'm happy with the results.My only issues so far are (1) the inability of my fingers to grasp the inner tabs on the lens cover (to remove/replace it) without sliding off. Yes, I could press in on the outer tabs but I prefer the inner ones, so I cut two small pieces of 225 grit sandpaper to fit the tabs and stuck them on with double-faced tape; works quite well, thank you! (2) The lens shade provided did not go on or off easily. You have to press in and turn it and I didn't want to put too much force on the lens while doing this. Hopefully, this will become easier with repeated usage. (3) Most of my exposures have been on the money so far but a couple were one stop over or underexposed, probably because the meter was fooled by the particular lighting situation. I should have anticipated that & auto-bracketed or done it manually. Neither issue is a big deal.Okay, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could but there was no option to do that and it seems nearly perfect for me so I gave it 5 stars.

I used the camera on a recent trip and was able to take some great scenery and other pics.  I like the feel, it's not too heavy to carry around like a slr, and compact enough to carry along (no additional lenses to lug around is kind of nice too).  The different options for picture taking are pretty simple, I like the pinhole style to give a ralxed look.  The battery life is pretty good, but it's always best to carry a spare.  The flip out reversable led screen is a nice to have when shooting at different angle or if you want self portraits.  I am still trying to fanagle with the video, but so far it looks pretty clear on hd.  The newer model FZ-200 just came out so I'm sure there are updated features.

What you (should) look for in a camera first is picture quality, then features. My mistake was buying this solely on the features...mainly the incredible zoom, raw support, excellent video recording, large flash, and fast shutter speed. Overall, I would say picture quality is good. I was  disappointed with the somewhat inconsistent results. Sometimes pictures are sharp, other times they are not. Low light shots are decent. The noise reduction is good, but sharpness just isn't what I was hoping for. I had the Lumix DMC-LX3 and really thought the picture quality was better. I returned it due to a defect (pictures were coming out green above ISO 200) and got this instead. I would say the LX3 had sharper images, but didn't have the zoom I was looking for.Do not buy this if you don't know how to use manual controls. I still think it's a great camera, but that's mostly due to the feature set and not image quality. However, having so many of these features (such as zoom) can help get shots and results you couldn't in a more compact camera. Bottom line is pictures can come out good, but may require some work. Raw mode is a must...don't expect to snap in jpg and keep all your results. I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could...but I am giving it 4 since 3 is not really fair.

In fact, I would say that the FZ150 will take great tourist/travel photos. It is not great in low light conditions but it is not poor either. I really like the fact that it has a viewfinder because, although the back screen is large and nice, in conditions of extreme light I cannot see anything. I use the back scree for videos. On the other hand, I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 for two reasons: the lens cap sucks and the sunshade too. Both for the same reason: they are clumsy to put on and off. The cap is worse than the shade. Panasonic gives you a thin wire to hang the cap but this wire is mother of all problems because after you put it in the cap it is almost imposible to keep the cap in place. Even more, you cannot use both together, that is, either you use the shade or you use the cap. Otherwise the cap will be getting off all the time.

Wanted camera with wide angle to long tele for scenery and then wildlife. Clearly best reviewed non-dslr, long lens digital out there.  This wass underscored when I found there were none in stock anywhere and a 5-6 week backlog for orders.  Looked at the Canon SX40 since I am a real Canon fan.  VERY disappointed in that camera.  Felt small and cheap.  Focus would not work and that was the reason for replacing my Samsung.  Have only had this camera for a few days but here are first impressions:PRO1.  Build quality seems good.  Feels solid2.  Fastest focus I have ever experienced.  See eagle in the sky?  Snap the camera up, get it anywere in the viewfinder, push the button and you've got the picture.  Amazing.3.  LOTS of features.  Almost too many.  Will have to relearn photography again to take full advantage.4.  Piictures seem to have good detail.5.  Color seems ok but maybe a little off.6.  Lerns hood and ability to put filter over lens7.  Lens looks and feels professional8.  Good macro focussing9.  Winde angle is terrific.  We had 16 foot xmas tree (always get big trees).  This is first camera that could get the whole tree in the pic without having th back up a city block.10.  HD video seems good and can zoom in it.CONS1.  Camera is short and if you have big hands like miine it feels a little precarious2.  Biggest problem are indoor photos.  Simply does not even get close to the true color on indoor photos using IA.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Probably the worst indoor color match of any digitial I've had.  Just discovered this morning how to go into manual mode and make manual adjustments to white balance to approxinmate the actual colors but who wants to have to set up the camera every time you go indoors?  A major ssurprise and disappointment.4.  Flash  does not ccmpensate for exposure.  Tried to get pic of a painting we received for Xmas.  Could not find away to get the flash from putting a huge bright spot in the middle of the picture.  Tried the manual adjustments to flash and aperature to no avail.5.  NO MANUAL.  Major bummer since the online version is over 200 pages.  At a $500 price point, they  Panasonic could afford to include a print manual.6.  Camera is very complex and you will have to go to school to learn and remember its features.7.  The rotary dial on the back is small and hardd to turn8.  Don't like location of the video switch.  Hard to feel with your finger compared to the last two cameras that had it on the back where I could just activate it with my thumb.9.  The four-way button is a little small and hard to operate with regular sized hands.This sounds like I am disappointed in the camera.  Guess maybe I am a little but there are a lot of good things about it. Hate to say it, but it is heads and shoulderss above the Canon.  Probably will keep it but there are some surprising and disappointing flaws in it.  Probably biggest concern is the indoor color balance which is just unusable.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall the very high outstanding photo and full HD Video quality for the price", "Author": "Stan", "ReviewID": "R12BD6UAQVW62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello Panasonic and Amazon for new customers: Pro: Both lens and Sensor is very low distortion for less than $500. Hey' you just got yourself $1200 camcorder plus $600 digital camera all in one. For being built-in stereo microphone is not bad at all. I had use built in flash (without sun glare lens hood) around 10 feet, indoor. Photo was so sharp. But one small problem: Is good thing, 'why?' Saturation is little weak because of just over brightness without any wash out image. Good thing: This will over powered any type images noise. If you own a Mac, with iPhoto, your problem is solved. All I did, I slightly turn down my iPhoto Exposure by few Percentage plus I had Boost Saturation around 15%. \"WOW!\" Same photo was taken by high $$$$ SLR camera looks. Same photo was viewed through cheaper model HP 15 inch laptop. The photo was so powerful and sharp and so clean, this had made HP laptop viewing nearly as stunning as photo being view quality of 15 inch Mac Book Pro looks from HP PC Windows 7 machine. Battery life is very good compare to most large body camera brands. Video in full HD is so sharp with bright natural color. Hey, Mac user; don't worry about it's for Microsoft Windows PC without smiling blue square face on Panasonic box. This FZ 150 camera is compatible to iMovie but SD-HC card is not compatible with iMovie because of Japanese format license for better quality full HD video. I also capture still photo from full HD video clip through Aperture 3 for pretty decent photos. And by the way, your SD-HC card movie clips is compatible for Mac iPhoto & Aperture 3, not for iMovie and Final Cut Pro. Because the bright moon fill in only quarter of my 3 by 2 photo screen your exposer usually be way too bright for auto focus & exposer  (manual focus & exposer is must). From FZ 150, use your aiming center square, as my both auto focus and auto exposer. \"I'm very surprised!\"  Con: Using video shooting as zooming during taking long clip in quiet place, you will hear some motor sound on your movie. #1 way to reduce the noise or eliminate the motorize noise: Mount the camera on the bracket with Flash/Ext. microphone shoe to mount direction Stereo microphone for greater distant from your zoom lens + direction mic is pointed away from zoom lens. Second Way: Use your audio control on your iMovie plus add on another soundtracks and music to drown out your zoom lens noise. Photo and video of moon at night, it does not agree with auto white balance, as the brownish moon look (Sepia Looks). Mac user: Use your iPhoto to cut back your Saturation by far for more normal bright moon looks. During indoor shot with regular lighting could be little better but it's not bad. Canon ELPH 300HS has 1 step better indoor shot that hold truer color without over yellowish Saturation looks. I say: This Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ 150 large body super-zoom is your very good choice for your money (both Mac & PC users).  My another comment: I tried to upload only 9 seconds of full HD Video, even Amazon is still of old-school (it,s too large file) Because of cut in video quality because of too small video file. For true Full HD Video as of great demo for better sale. I can't tell if this video cameras is any good by seeing poor quality as very un-HD Video.

All I can say is be careful what you get rid of over the years because someday you may want it back depending on something  you may not consider at the time.First, I still own the fz50 and I have to say that it is totally a better built camera than the fz150. There is actual metal on the fx50 and I can say that it just feels more rugged than the fz150. That said, I dropped its predecessor ( which I also owned) and perhaps due to its heft and of course its nemisis, gravity,  it killed the camera for good which is why I got the fz50.  So recently I got the fz150 and I have to say I do like except for a few details that I think Panasonic should have noticed but cared not to.  It seems that before companies know how to save money and they are trying to break into a newer market, there are no holds barred so to speak. Then,  a company is able to scrutinize its product then they are able to cut corners in ways that we consumers eventually notice. Such is the case in the fz150. First, and most noticably,  the camera is light which is good I suppose but I feel like it would break if I looked at it wrong. Second, some of the buttons seem a bit \"wonky\" or giggly. Maybe they are supposed to be this way for reasons I don't understand. Also, the buttons are small. Much smaller than for instance the fz50. It seems to take great pictures and video and has tons of little options and menus which you could deal with for days and days if you wanted. I like the camera and will probably keep it but I just wish it were a little sturdier feeling. Another thing is that the roller knob on the back is stiff to roll and I just don't like it. Also, there is only one rolller knob when the fz50 had two which is very convenient. I think they do these things to save space in the camera. One other thing, they should have put some grippiness on the squeezer things on the lens cap.To finish, for the money, this is a great camera and don't be afraid of what has been said to deter you from getting it. If you are looking for pro results, don't get it. If you a are looking for great results with tons of options and exellent hd video, do get this camera.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "FZ150", "Author": "LV", "ReviewID": "R168XP25QAXY1I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not a professional reviewer or photographer...so please accept that I may bounce around a bit and don't cover everything. I would have probably rated it 5 stars if it was made with the same quality as the FZ35. I'm giving it 4 stars now, but will re-rate after I've used it more.I just received the FZ150 and will post my first impressions. I've owned the FZ28 and FZ35. I purchased the FZ150 to upgrade from the FZ35. I've only taken a hand full of shots with the FZ150. Both cameras were set to Auto, as picture quality in auto is important to a lot of people coming from point and shoot cameras. I wanted to know what the cameras compare straight from the box. Of course, manual settings can improve IQ in both cameras.Body:I must admit the FZ150 feels cheaper made than the FZ35. I was disappointed with that.The FZ150 has tiny little metal strap slots, on the FZ35 these were much stronger looking.The FZ150 has cheap rubber coverings over the ports, while the FZ35 has sturdy, well made plastic ones that open and close nicely.The FZ150 lens sticks out a wee bit from the lens base making me feel like it could be damaged more easily than the FZ35 that tucks away completely.The FZ150's battery door has a slide nub that is more annoying for me to open and close. I prefer the push-pull door on the FZ35.The FZ150 does have a hot shoe, Yea!!, which I wish the FZ35 had. I probably wouldn't have updated if the FZ35 had one, and I would have missed out on a sweet new camera. But, there is no plastic hot shoe cover in my box. I don't like leaving it uncovered when not in use.The FZ150 is both larger and heavier than the FZ35. Since I like to take pictures one handed, this quickly becomes apparent when I hold it.The FX150 battery also has a cheaper feel to it, though it is rated as 895mAh, vs the FZ35 695mAh. I have not tested the batteries.The FZ150 does have a rotating screen, and this is a big plus to many users. Unfortunately, I will get little use out of that feature, as I don't tend to use it.The FZ150 has a 6x greater zoom. This is a big plus for me.The FZ150 has a much cheaper, poorer quality lens cap than the FZ35. If I could swap them out I would.The FZ150 now has the camcorder button on the top of the camera near the shutter release. That is much more awkward for me to reach. I much prefer the FZ35 location near my thumb.The FZ150 has a auto/manual focus on the lens base, I'll have to play around with that feature.The FZ150 has a 52mm lens that accepts filters and lenses. Yea!!The button layout is different between the two cameras. Currently I prefer the FZ35 layout, but that is probably due to the fact that I'm used to it and don't much care for change, nothing that a little time won't cure..I've only taken a very few pictures with the FZ150. I will have to expand my review when I've spent more time with it.AS it is one thing I noticed is that the colors produced are warmer than the colors from the FZ35...I'm very much partial to the cooler color tones. If anyone knows how I can adjust that in camera with the FZ150, please contact me and let me know. I think I will miss my cool color tones more than anything else after I sell my FZ35.So far picture quality has been very similar in the few pictures I've taken. I've not tested all the settings. I've not taken action or outside shots. The only real difference I saw is when I took a shot of my ceiling fan while both the light and fan were on. The FZ150 was able to get a better shot of that.I took pictures of both cameras side by side as comparison pictures of the same still objects. I just need to find a way to post them.I will add more as I use it more.Please go to the link to view the pictures I've taken.

I did extensive research into the camera prior to purchasing it and was willing to make the switch from Canon to Panasonic as a result. I have several Canon L lenses and DSLRs, so one could say that I have a fairly high standard when it comes to image quality. That said, I realize that this is NOT a DSLR. As such, I compared the image quality to that of my 2-year old Canon Digital Elf point-and-shoot. Given that this camera is several hundred dollars more expensive than the Digital Elf, I expected there to be increased functionality and image quality. While the CONCEPT of such functionality does exist, the execution unfortunately leaves much to be desired. Here are some of my major gripes with this camera, which ultimately led me to return it and purchase the Canon SX40 instead:1) Color: This camera does NOT perform well in low light and tends to skew images to a darker, more grungy color scheme. Color quality is NOT natural at all. Having played around with various modes and options, I was hard pressed to find one that produced natural rendering. While the camera does have RAW as an option, it would be nice if you could use this camera on JPG if you want and still have the option of getting accurate colors and lighting. This is, after all, a glorified point-and-shoot, so you don't necessarily want to have to spend hours doing post-production work just to get images to look realistic. My Canon Digital Elf has far more natural color and lighting, even on auto.2) Viewfinder: The viewfinder on this camera is pretty much a novelty item, not an actual feature. The image appears blue tinted and looks as though you are looking through a cheap, fuzzy, plastic screen. Given that it is useless for composition, I'm not quite sure the purpose of its inclusion.3) Overall design: Call me crazy, but this camera just looks cheap. It has a plastic aesthetic that doesn't do it's $450 justice.4) Mac compatibility: Transferring videos to my mac was not necessarily straightforward. It is doable, but far more of a hassle than with any of my prior Canon cameras. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is still a bit frustrating when you combine it with some of the other irritants.OVERALL: GET THE CANON SX40 OR AN ENTRY-LEVEL DSLRIf you want the IDEA of good features, then this camera is for you. However, the execution is far from ideal. Now, some of this may be personal preference. I know that Panasonic is known for shooting slightly cooler toned images, whereas Canon is warmer. However, I must say that I tried my Panasonic in numerous different types of light and was hard pressed to get accurate color. I have since exchanged this camera for the Canon SX40 and am happy I did. At $100 cheaper, it may not shoot RAW, but the images it does shoot are infinitely more true-to-life. The auto focus seems a tad slower than the Panasonic, but the ultimate image seems sharper and cleaner.So, I think it depends on what you are wanting. If you are someone that is looking for a true bridge camera that accurately renders color, then I'd say go with the Canon SX40. If you are wanting features such as the ability to shoot RAW, then pay the extra money and get an entry-level DSLR.

I'm home now and just downloaded the shots I took, and have mixed reactions. Some of the shots are quite good, and some are disappointingly bad. The color on most pics is quite a true representation, which is great. The macro shots I took are stunning. Many of the long-zoom shots are also quite good. In both of those instances I switched the camera to the mode specifically for that situation. What's not so great thus far are many short-to-middle distance shots taken with the IA setting.  Not sure why that is, since some shots taken from the same spot with the same settings are just fine. Obviously, now that I'm home I need to take the time to really read through the manual and try all settings. I had considered returning this camera, but after re-reading reviews here, I've decided against that for now. My point is to say that just using the IA setting out of the box did not produce the results for me that others seem to have achieved.But to be fair, I haven't done enough homework to give any further review.

When I got tired of packing 20 pounds of gear, I graduated to about the same roster of equipment, only this time using much smaller Pentax bodies and lenses.Enough already.  Those were my \"bridge cameras\" from where I moved up into digital photography. There have been several cameras since then, but my latest one, after many hours of research, is this Panasonic FZ150.  It had to beat my trusted Konica-Minolta A200 that has been serving me will for several years.  The FZ150 is so good that I'll even give up the K-M A200's amazing mechanical zoom.It's interesting that it doesn't seem to compute, even to professional reviewers, that a superzoom fits many people's needs and that they are not buying one because they can't afford some big, clunky dSLR with its less-than-stellar kit lens.  They still can't resist ending their reviews with something like, \"It's a terrific camera, but don't forget that for a few dollars more, you could buy an entry-level dSLR and kit lens.\" For my use, I wouldn't trade my FZ150 for ANY dSLR, entry-level or not!I'm not going to repeat all the positive attributes that have already been presented here over and over; I'll just confirm them.  One of the criteria for me to make this purchase (and keep the camera) was low-light performance.  This camera seems to make light where there is none.  I have taken amazing photos by candlelight with this thing, and once you set it up properly, there are no noise issues, either.  I use a setting of -1 on noise control and +1 on sharpness and the images continue to amaze me. My disclaimer:  I'm looking for excellent results at the 11 x 14 print level.  I am not interested in printing posters or murals from my photos.Here's a simple little event that really impressed me with the capabilities of this camera:  We have a neighbor with a pet Macaw.  He's a huge bird of amazing color.  One day we had bird-lover friends over and they really wanted to see this bird that frequents the huge redwood trees that make up our environs.  The bird opted to perch high in one of the trees, but with the sun off to the side behind him so all we could see was a small silhouette.  I got out my new camera, zoomed in tightly on the bird and took the picture in \"intelligent auto\" (idiot-proof) mode and what I got was a brilliantly clear picture of the bird with all of his gorgeous colors intact.  We were all duly impressed.Anyway, please forgive the non-technical \"intro\" to the up-coming \"real\" review. I'll update as I get time to become more familiar with the camera.  So far, I absolutely love it.  I still wish there had been a manual with the camera and feel Panasonic is really failing their loyal customers by not even making one available as an extra-cost option. I did print the entire pdf version of the Advanced Manual on a duplex (both sides of the page) printer, trimmed the pages to 5 x 8 inches and bound them into a very nice book.  I should not have had to do that!", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "appletree", "ReviewID": "R1RE4OGPEKJ5GS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Panasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black)I had an FZ28 and I still have an FZ35 and an FZ40. I have been thrilled with all of them, especially the image quality which regularly exceeded anything I would have thought possible, even with much more expensive and sophisticated cameras. I wanted to get the FZ100 last year but went with the FZ40 based on many negative comments about the IQ as compared to the FZ35. I hoped and expected that Panasonic would fix the problem with the next upgrade, the FZ150, and the initial reviews suggested they had. Unless I received a lemon from an otherwise quality camera model, I can state that the IQ problem is still huge. I have no other complaints; I greatly prefer the design and operation of the 150 over the earlier models. It does focus and shoot very quickly. However, the end result for me was a set of images, none of which would I be comfortable sharing with friends. I took many exposures of varied subjects under excellent lighting conditions and although the exposure was consistently good, not one was as crisp, sharp, clean, and pleasant to look at as the vast majority of images I have taken under comparable conditions and with the same or similar settings with the other models. I did not try changing the sharpness and noise settings on the camera as I just could not imagine I could achieve sufficient improvement to make me happy with the camera, and I did not want to keep using the camera and risk degrading the condition so as to complicate the return process. I have been a devoted fan of the Lumix line and I will probably give the FZ47 a try, once this return is complete.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Read the Manual.

I was disappointed to find that the lense hood was quite stuck on the camera.. It comes installed in reverse for shipping. First I tried to unscrew it but it would not budge, and I was afraid to put any more force on the camera lense/body mechanisms. I called Panasonic and the help tech. was not helpful. He wasted my time collecting phone and email info then told me that the hood unscrews counter-clockwise. He told me that since the hood was reversed on the camera, that it must be a used camera as they don't ship them that way.. IMHO... This is a lame attempt at shifting blame to seller or Amazon. It's clear from the packaging that there is no other place for the hood to reside in the box. I did a web search and found that in fact, this is a common problem for the Panasonic FZ series.Here's a link to the relevant thread.[...]I am a new product quality engineer for a major retail electronic device company.. So IMHO.. here's the real story..The lens hood for these cameras has an overyly agressive (flawed) latching mechanism design. I seriously doubt that it is healthy for the camera to be subjected to the amount of torque that must be required to remove or fully install the lense hood. I just can't bring myself to twist on this new camera any harder than I am already doing.  I will return it to Amazon.Panasonic:1) Redesign and recall/replace the lense hoods. I suspect that continue use of the current design will cause damage to the camera.2) Describe lens hood removal and installation in the product manual.2) Provide your help staff with current issue descriptions and solutions..

You wouldn't want narrow depth of field with wide angle (wide is for panoramas, etc) so you zoom in - and the f-stop increases automatically and you cannot override it, even though you ostensibly have \"aperture priority.\" You don't.So I just paid $500 for a camera that advertises aperture priority starting at f-stop 2.8, but it automatically increases your f-stop setting as you zoom in. Zooming in is exactly what you need to achieve narrow depth of field, along with a low f-stop.I paid for a basic feature of photography that Panasonic claims is possible with this camera, but is not.
