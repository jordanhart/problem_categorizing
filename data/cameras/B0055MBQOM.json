{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Comparing to the i1Display", "Author": "Stephen M. Lerch", "ReviewID": "R2IFD7WNK5IKQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, my disclaimer. I received this for free through Amazon Vine. Anyone's review that displays the Vine badge also received this for free. I review all of the things I receive as if I had paid for them for maintaining my review integrity.As I also received the Xrite EODIS3 i1Display Pro from Amazon Vine, I will approach this review by comparing the two devices. The reason being that someone in the market for color calibration will definitely see these two devices and wonder which is the better device to spend their money on.For informational purposes, I am using a Windows 7 Professional 64 bit Lenovo T410 with 6 GB of RAM. I have not tried this on a Mac as I do not own one, though the manual claims it will work on Mac OS 10.5 or 10.6 with the latest updates installed.Packaging:Not too surprisingly, the packaging for the ColorMunki and the i1 Display Pro are nearly identical. The box is the same size and shape. The only difference between the two is the cover art and description on the back of the boxes.Manual:The manual is EXACTLY the same, with the exception of the i1Display name is changed to ColorMunki in the ColorMunk manual obviously. Seriously. They are exactly the same, word for word, picture for picture.And this manual is a JOKE. It should be treated as merely a quick start guide, as it is called, as it doesn't contain any troubleshooting information or anything else of use outside of installing the software and plugging in the device/using the software. It's minimalist.Software install:Process is much the same. I HIGHLY recommend, to avoid frustration, that you head over to X-Rite's website and download the latest version of the software and NOT use the disc included. The included disc is one version old compared to the updated version available.The software requires a reboot, so be sure you aren't doing anything else in the background when it installs.Hardware/Software:The hardware device looks the same and functions the same as the i1Display Pro with the exception of a few color changes.The software looks different but provides similar functionality. Each offers advanced and basic operation (basic is just put the device on the screen and keep hitting next, advanced allows you to choose luminance and also calibrates your brightness and contrast). The nice thing that is missing from the ColorMunki software is the Printer Calibration add on.Calibration on the ColorMunki took 5 minutes to complete. The basic color patch, that seemed the same to me between the two pieces of software, took the i1Display Pro only about 2.5 minutes to complete. So the ColorMunki is about half as slow as the i1Display Pro. The other difference is that the i1Display Pro allows you to use large color patches to calibrate. Using the largest patch on the i1Display Pro, calibration took me 8 minutes or so while the medium sized patch took about 5 minutes.So here's the most important part of this review and comparison. The ColorMunki's profile/calibration is as good as the i1Display Pro. I have switched between the two device's color profiles and can see no discernible difference between the two profiles. No difference AT ALL. The two device provided profiles that look identical to my eyes.Then the question you will be, so what are the differences?Other than the color of the device and different packaging colors, here are the major differences:i1Display has ambient light measurements for color and luminance, the ColorMunki only does Luminance. This is only a consideration if you choose to use the option on either device, outside of calibration, to have your color profile update based on ambient light conditions (which also requires either device to be plugged in all the time).i1Display is faster (X-Rite claims 5x, but based on my testing it seemed more like 2x)The i1Display Pro offers Predefined, Custom or Measured White Point and White Luminance while the ColorMunki offers only Predefined for these options. For these, I would say if  you are a hobbyist like me, you probably aren't going to be messing that deeply with the White options from these devices. Professionals WILL want the i1Display Pro for sure.i1Display Pro allows you to save Work Flows for future use, the ColorMunki does not. For most hobbyists, this won't be an issue and for a lot of professionals it may not be that significant either.ColorMunki Tone Response Predefined options (1.8, 2.2) while i1Display Pro is Predefined (1.8, 2.2, 3.0, sRGB). I'm not sure what the difference between these options so I can't comment.The i1Display Pro offers Characterization Target via Iterative and Optimized based on PANTONE colors or specific images while the ColorMunki only offers Iterative. There is no clear explanation given on X-Rite's website to explain the difference and the pitiful \"manuals\" certainly don't help.The i1Display Pro offers Display Quality Assurance (you can run all sorts of tests with the i1Display Pro to validate calibrations and different displays), Display Uniformity Test (this tells you how good/bad 9 cross sections of your display are so you know the best areas of a display to work on for color critical applications) and Numeric Display Matching (both devices offer Visual validation, that is, shows you the difference, only the i1Display Pro offers you numeric values for validation purposes).The $80 question (the price difference between the two devices) comes down to a hobbyist to speed. If you are OK spending 5 minutes calibrating the display instead of only taking 2.5, then the ColorMunki is the device to buy. The profiles are nearly identical (as best I can tell) and both do a great job of calibrating displays.If you are a professional, you will be much better served buying the Xrite EODIS3 i1Display Pro. You likely know what you want your white set to and most likely have a need for constant calibrations for color accuracy. It is also nice that, while initially confusing for me, that you have the Printer Profiling capability built into the software, as most likely as a professional you will want what comes out of your printer to be as close to as exactly the same as what you see on your displays. As a hobbyist, I won't ever be there though given the price of Printer Profiling hardware.I am a HOBBYIST. I don't need to validate my display to ensure my colors are accurate for anyone other than myself. (**PLEASE SEE EDIT BELOW**) For me, as the ColorMunki and i1Display Pro can be treated as single use devices (for most hobbyists, once you've calibrated the display, you're pretty much done with the device unless you REALLY have a desire for the ambient light sensor functionality), I would have been happy with just using the ColorMunki on my displays. I guess you could wind up using them again in the future with the purchase of a new display, but really the ColorMunki is the device of choice, in my mind, for hobbyists like me.Over all, as a hobbyist, I would be quite happy with just a ColorMunki alone. Professionals will need the i1Display Pro.EDIT- So after doing a more thorough investigation on display calibration, the prevailing logic is that your displays change over time. While going through a digital imaging class, it seems that the recommendation is once a week or once every other week for proper calibration. I'd say that's probably more for professional level (and maybe once a day calibration if you are a professional!). As a hobbyist, I'm finding my display isn't changing enough to justify the minute levels of calibration I see on a weekly to bi-weekly basis to put it back into proper calibration that frequently. Once a month seems to do me just fine, and even then calibration doesn't require more than a brightness tweak, if anything at all.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value, good colors", "Author": "Aldo R. Perez \"aldorp\"", "ReviewID": "R1R3MCH0K14LMP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I'm an old Photoshop user with over 18 years of experience.  For me accurate colors are not an option, I NEED accurate colors.Second, I'm used to calibrating my displays by hand.  I have set of calibration images I have used effectively across the years.  Manual calibration has become difficult as the number of displays I use in a day has increased.  One thing is to get decent colors and another to have multiple displays have the SAME colors.Third, I have the Pantone Huey Pro and I was never totally happy with the results.  I could always see some kind of color cast on the result so I ended having to tweak the resulting color profile by hand.I got the ColorMunki because it seemed like an upgrade from the legendary X-Rite i1Display.  I did find some reviews for the ColorMunki but they all used the more expensive model, the Xrite i1Display Pro for their reviews.  Still, after careful study I determined that the added features of the i1Display Pro model were not relevant to my needs.  The ColorMunki had all the features and parameters I was looking for.The included software was easy to use.  There was an update on the X-Rite site for the software but it looked like a small update.I went through the menus, follow instructions.  Calibration took like 5 minutes.  It measures ambient light and has the option to compensate for changing lighting conditions.  This is an option I don't care much for but is there is you want it.  You need to leave the ColorMunki connected to your computer for this.During calibration the ColorMunki actually took control of my monitor settings.  Changing contrast, brightness, color balance and then adding a color profile to Windows.  I was VERY impressed and the results were better than anything I have ever seen.It even did a GREAT job with my two laptops.  In those cases I had to manually increase or decrease the screen brightness but again a painless process.In total I calibrated 5 computers and all look very close in brightness and colors.  I never would have been able to do this with hand calibration.Overall I'm very happy with the results from the ColorMunki.  I can now move from computer to computer without having to worry about the colors been incorrect.  My laptops (like most laptops these days) use TN displays that shift the colors as you change viewing angles (reason graphic artist are hesitant to use laptops for graphic work) but it was still a huge improvement from the default settings.  Just getting the brightness of the laptops correct was a big win.I recommend this product for any photographer and graphic artist that care about color accuracy.-------UPDATE-------First, there has been an update from X-Rite to the X-Rite XRD Manager.  It seems to solve several problems with the program not responding.  This component (the XRD Manager) gets installed by the X-Rite drivers but this component got a separate update.Go to the X-Rite site and search for \"X-Rite Device Services (XRD)\", the latest version as of today is 2.2.  Below are a list of issues (rare issues) I have encountered with ColorMunki but I don't know if this update would solve any, some or all of them.  Will update in the future after this update.I wanted to update my review with several issues I have encountered while calibrating some displays.  Note, all my testing is with Windows 7 64bit and Vista 32bit computers, I don't know how the ColorMunkey would work on a Mac or older versions of Windows.Problem 1:  For some displays I've had to calibrate twice to get the right colors.  Not common but it has happened to me.  If the colors don't look right try again. I suspect this to be a Windows issue (I suspect the latest patch will fix this).Problem 2: It works better when Windows has drivers for the monitor.  Yes, for most monitors in Windows 7 and Vista Microsoft will send you drivers for your monitor through the Windows update feature (optional updates).  ColorMunkey seems to use the information on the drivers to some extent.Problem 3: I have found SOME monitors that REFUSE to calibrate NO MATTER what.  ColorMunkei depends on being able to take control of the monitor settings.  I found that one of my old Samsung 21\" monitor (DVI Connection) would not calibrate no matter what.  Then again this monitor has poor colors even if you manually calibrate it.Problem 4:  This is perhaps the biggest problem for many, ColorMunkei doesn't do miracles.  A bad display is, well ...  a bad display.  To get acceptable results ColorMunkei needs all primary colors and most of the secondary colors to display within an acceptable range (usually no more than 3 deltas of difference from ideal color).  Some displays will not give you good colors no matter how you calibrate.  In those cases calibration becomes more of an art than a science and ColorMunkei is no good at that.  Manual calibration is your only hope here as only you can know what color defects are acceptable to you.Example:  A particular monitor can't display blues right, after calibration all other colors look good but now you have a blue color cast because calibrating the other colors actually highlights the blue color issue even more. I still would recommend Color Munkey without hesitation but problem number 3 is specially disturbing.  This tells me that at least on Windows machines we can get some kind of hardware/software incompatibility that you can't overcome (I have not tested with the latest patch from X-Rite yet).  Problem number 4 is more about expectations, know your hardware and understand what it can do.  TN panels are cheap and color quality varies a LOT on them.  You CAN make them look better after calibration but IPS are generally better if color is critical to you.  It is better to begin with a good display and then calibrate to get the most from it.  Don't get a bad display and expect calibration to fix every color issue.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "ColorMunki Display vs Spyder Express", "Author": "Henry Page", "ReviewID": "R1OETCUFZ1F25V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a Los Angeles based professional photographer working in entertainment related commercial photography.  After disappointing results from the pantone huey pro I was debating between ColorMunki and Spyder express which are in similar price categories. The Spyder only allows you to profile one device per user license. With the ColorMunki I've profiled all the computers in my home and it works amazingly well. It takes control of most monitors brightness and contrast settings within the software so to know you're getting a very accurate profile. On devices like my flat screen TV it's on screen guide prompted me to raise and lower the contrast and brightness with the TV's remote which was super cool and produced incredible results. An added bonus is that it can also profile DLP or LCD Projectors. For the price I'm thrilled with the ColorMunki Display.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Must Have Tool for Color Matching", "Author": "Anthony M", "ReviewID": "R1RZ59XHNG2TA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Colormunki display for a little over a year now, and figured I should say something about it. It's one of those things that you hesitate to purchase, and once you do becomes one of those invaluable things that works so well you forget about it. I received this as a gift shortly before I purchased the ASUS PA246Q Monitor, using it on a Samsung 910T PVA panel. I had just purchased the Epson Expression 10000XL Wide-Format Graphic Arts Scanner and Epson Stylus Photo R3000 Wireless Wide-Format Color Inkjet Printer (C11CA86201) to reproduce my Wife's artwork. It was time to get serious about color matching.Coming from a design background, I'm used to using calibrated monitors and viewing stations with temperature controlled lighting for offset printing such as packaging. I'm also a cheapskate and for home use have always calibrated my monitors by eye. For most purposes this can work quite well depending on whether or not you have a target to work with. Most people don't need a calibration device, or can't take advantage of one because they're using an inferior monitor. When it comes to spot colors, artwork and photography, it gets a little more critical as far as final output. It's dicey enough to get something to print exactly (or even close to) the way you see it on your monitor. It's even trickier to color match a piece of artwork that you've scanned. Needless to say, the Colormunki worked quite well with the Samsung, but I could also instantly see the monitor wasn't capable of reproducing colors (sometimes near fluorescent) that oil pastels are capable of. Once matched with a fantastic IPS panel, I was set!Now, I've used and seen used many brands of calibration devices, and I believe that both the X-Rite and Spider units are excellent. However, I've had more experience and luck with X-Rite's software, a version of which also happens to come bundled with the Epson Scanner and works quite well. One physical feature I prefer is the form factor compared to the Spyders. The Spyders are like Mice with 3 legs, and in turn sit in little cradles when on the desktop. To me, it's a rather ungainly solution. The Colormunki is quite small, self-contained and sits upright on its own. Nothing to knock over really, and a very small footprint. The diffuser flips over when reading the monitor, and flips back when sitting on the desktop. The Spyder also seems to me to be \"directional\" when it sits on its cradle, the Colormunki seems to be more omnidirectional as it points straight up.Be aware though that the Colormunki Display is what I would consider the rock-bottom of calibration devices. There are a few things it doesn't do, and for professional use I would definitely spring for one of the better models. For instance, there is no way to read the actual luminance of the monitor, only to set it. For most photographers and designers, this sort of thing is not an issue. Especially if you're in control of the print process. However, if money was on the line, then it would pay to get the higher end device.Another thing that you should look for in a calibration device is the ability to read ambient light and correct for it at intervals. My home office has 2 windows on 2 walls, and the light changes drastically throughout the day. This adjusts for it quite well (set for every 10 minutes) as well as when the sun goes down. I could not recommend a device that cannot compensate in this way. Color correction should always be done in a lit room - ideally in an environment that is close to how the final product will be viewed. This can't always happen, and the colormunki compensates. If you're the type who likes to color correct in a darkened room, then good luck to you is all I can say - because what I'd like to say isn't G rated!I've also been using this on Windows 7 for a year, and recently Windows 8 Pro. When I installed Windows 8, it had no issues actually finding the Colormunki drivers and installing them without assistance. Of course, I still needed to install the calibration software and recalibrate to my new graphics card. My old ATI card was causing issues with Adobe CS6. The software itself comes in easy and expert modes, unless you wish to pick a particular color temperature for your lighting situation, I recommend keeping it on easy mode. It does a great job and is fairly quick - the whole process takes about 3-4 minutes. That could be slow if you calibrate often, but I've found once the monitor stabilizes (age-wise) it's not really that necessary to do frequently.Just so you know the calibration software is working, there's a before and after image to compare the difference. I find with my Asus monitor it warms whites up ever so slightly from before. More importantly, I can scan images in (Adobe RGB) and have very little color correction to do. Any color corrections that I do based on the artwork are accurately reflected in the printed material.If you're printing at home and are the sort who likes to experiment and use materials other than papers with ICC profiles, I would recommend looking at the ColorMunki Photo - Monitor, Printer & Projector Profiler which allows you to calibrate your printer on specific media as well.Pros:- Easy to setup and use- Calibrates for ambient light- Good software- Windows 8 64 bit compatible- Small footprint- Simple design- Decent priceCons:- Still expensive- Software could be better still (get better model)- Software is slow if you need to calibrate often- Dull lookingBottom line, it's one of those things you'll always wonder how you got along without. It's perfect for those who control the creative process in house. Professional photographers and designers will certainly have something to gain from it. It will also get immediately ignored, other than the fact you need to have it in a spot close to your monitor to read the light correctly. It's a conversation starter for people who wonder what the weird little glowing device is sitting on your desk. I give it 5 stars for a good intro price-point and doing what it's supposed to do. It's not fun or romantic, but it gets the job done, and quite well.*** Update 9/21/13 ***Important Notice!I did run into a problem with the device when installing onto a new computer.No, it wasn't windows 8 (already running on old computer).No, it wasn't the drivers (I did try them all at first as I was pulling out my hair).It was the new energy saving PC!Apparently (and this may be common with the new Haswell chip) the USB ports don't have enough \"oomph\" to power the device.Once I got a powered USB hub the problem was solved.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent color calibration device", "Author": "Bryan Noll", "ReviewID": "R2ZR7R01427LDG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use my Color Munki Display with a late 2008 15\" Mac Book Pro.Its amazing to see the initial before and after views after the first calibration.I started by downloading the lastest version of the software from their website, installed it, then connected the device.Its super simple to setup. Even the advanced setup option, which is the best option to use in my opinion, is completely guided and easy.Depending on the type of screen you have, there are some controls, specifically contrast and brightness, that you may not have the ability to control.  There are points during the setup when you'll be prompted to adjust these controls if you can, or just skip them if you can't.The whole setup up process takes a little less than 10 minutes to complete.You have to option to have the device monitor the ambient light in your workspace and automatically adjust the screen brightness if that light level changes.

The reason it took me so long was that I just didn't want to add another peripheral to my digital photo computer set-up (software, noise reduction, cataloging, CD & DVD burning, printer, photo papers,ink cartridges)or testing various monitors, and trying to follow monitor guidelines.

And I have a cheap monitor! The largest improvement I've found is in the level of illumination. For years, I'd print out a couple of images, and they would be too dark, so I would compensate by raising the lumen level. What a waste of paper.The only proviso I would make is that you don't choose the 'simple' calibration method. It's worthwhile to go through the slightly more complex full calibration set-up. Additionally, keep your ambient light level wherever you print as proximate as possible on any give day. If you calibrate with three incandescent lights in your work area, don't move them, and remember to keep them on or off position as when you calibrated. I especially like the 'anti-flare' feature which is designed to reduce reflective light from influencing your perception of the monitor. I'm assuming this feature is doing its job, since the brightness factor between monitor display and print seem just right.

I'm going to make up for that here if Amazon will allow. I'd noted that the Colormunki wasn't so easy to use and that's still true. It's not because it can be so confusing when it sends up different menus depending on the current state of your display. Displays differ, of course, and so people will get different results (and menus) depending on what display they have.I have both an Apple Cinema (20\") LED and a Samsung (17\") LCD. Until buying the Colormunki I was using a Huey Pro II, also from X-Rite/Pantone.First I ought note that in any event the concept of the Colormunki from a practical standpoint is already a lot better than that of the Huey Pro, which uses suction cups to keep the device attached to the screen. (For any concerned, the Huey never left and permanent damage, but it does leave marks on a display after use--assuming one had to press hard enough to keep the thing from falling off during gaging. But no permanent damage.) The Colornunki instead employs a counterweight method that I like a whole lot better, though one must be sure to take care that the device lays flat against the screen lest measurements be worthless. Any light getting in from outside will render measurements worthless.Like the Huey, the Colormunki is also capable of ambient light monitoring though at only five-minute intervals (shortest time available) instead of two-minute ones with the Huey Pro. I don't notice as much change in the display when using the Colormunki as I did with the Huey. With the Huey, changing light in the room resulted in a very noticeable change on the display. Not so with the Colormunki, so I remain skeptical of the Colormunki's capability with respect to ambience monitoring. Not that I think that so important, but it's a nice feature, even for someone who like me works mostly in the dark. In a brightly lit room or office one might have more of a problem.I'd complained in my previous review of not noticing much of a change in my display after going through all the steps, and that too remains true. But I'd also complained of the fact that, also like the Huey, since this applies to both devices, getting brightness and contrast right is the trickiest (and most important) part. The Apple has no contrast control (too my never-ending annoyance while the Samsung allows very fine control over everything.With these less expensive models of calibrators X-Rite/Pantone can't seem to be very bothered with arranging things such that one can get brightness and contrast right from the outset. No doubt with the more expensive devices the problems are more directly addressed and finer adjustments are possible. (Personally, I think $160 is enough to have to pay for one of these things, especially given the prices for everything else one needs to create a consistent color workflow.)I wrote my first review too soon. When things weren't looking too good I finally decided to start over at much lower brightness levels on both displays. Up popped different menus--this time--asking that I make some adjustments, especially to the Samsung, but to the Apple as well. In the case of the Apple I wound up setting the brightness to 0, that is, reducing brightness until I could do so no further (which the software indicated was perfectly acceptable if necessary). On the Samsung--and the Colormunki seemed to know I have two different types of displays--I was asked to increase and then reduce brightness to certain levels, which I did.I should note that contrast is hardly addressed, if at all, in either case, not with the Huey and not with the Colormunki. In both cases a clumsy method (eyeball comparison) is all that's available in order to adjust contrast, which, as I noted, can't be done with the Apple Cinema in any case. But this business of making contrast adjustments until one image (put up by the software) matches another is just dumb. That's no scientific way to go about adjusting contrasts on displays. One might just as well use in-built methods for both Mac and Windows for all the contrast-adjusting part of the process is worth using either Huey or Colormunki. I just set the Samsung to 75% contrast and left it.But since recalibrating with minimal brightnesses, adjusted only slightly, for both displays both of my displays are now--finally and at long last--displaying colors that are pretty damn close to prints I make.The Colormunki, unlike the Huey, allows setting white point, which is important though you'll never learn why from the far-too-brief instructions provided by X-Rite. In general, instructions for both devices would warrant one-star ratings at best. They're truly terrible at explaining anything, i.e., like what you're doing, let alone why you're even bothering. Instead of defaults I set white points for both displays to \"native.\" Because I think that's best as a matter of common sense. One is working with THIS display and not displays in general.But I now have what appear to be color-cast-free, clear and not-too-bright displays to work with--since setting brightnesses to zero for the Apple and just slightly brighter for the Samsung.  All along, including while using the Huey, for which software is worthy only of starting fires, my screens were far too bright while all my prints looked too dark. But it never stood to reason to reduce brightness on the Apple to zero. Doing so makes whites look fairly grimy, but I don't care about that anymore now that my prints look like what's on my display--within reason, of course, and outside a D-50 light-box. For those less experienced at this, prints will never look exactly like images on displays, because displays backlight images whereas prints are not usually backlit but lit only reflectively--by the light falling upon them.The problem of trying to get an image displayed on a computer display to match one on paper is not solvable. One is really talking apples and oranges, and unlike even those, the twain shalll never meet. Writers on these topics often carry on as though it were really possible to make the two match when the very idea is absurd. They can't do it and neither can you or anyone else.So, if you're having any problems getting things to match, think lower brightness, which is likely to solve your problem. I'd always read that brightness should never be lower than when white looks pure white, not in the least dimmed or \"dirty.\" That's not true either. Otherwise you might also consider setting your white points to native instead of leaving them at defaults or even setting them to what's \"recommended.\"Turns out the Colormunki's not so bad after all, which doesn't mean it still couldn't be better. I won't give it 5 stars, and 3 and a half would be closest.One more thing: When I first bought the Colormunki, the ambient monitoring would not load properly on start up, not in Snow Leopard and not in Windows XP. (I run both on a Mac Pro.)  Same problem with the Huey, by the way. Since purchase I discovered that X-Rite or Pantone had posted fixes. Previously they were recommending another clumsy work-around, especially for Mac, wherein nothing loaded. With Windows, the thing would load but always with an error message. The problem had to do with order in which devices or software start up when the computer is brought up, turned on or awakened. At first X-Rite recommended a little start-up program that would allow one to readjust start-up order in Windows. Nothing but starting up the Colormunki app was recommended for Mac. (One has open the app and then close it before an icon appears in Mac's version of systray.)  Then came the fixes, which I downloaded for both Mac and PC. (Oh, that little start-up program previously recommended? Not such a good idea. I'd not recommend messing with it.)The fix for PC works, no more error message on start up and the monitor loads properly in systray. No such luck with the Mac fix. It does nothing whatsoever near as I can discern and so I still have to start the app and then close before the ambient light monitoring will start up. X-Rite seems to have all kinds of problems writing simple software for OS X. Naturally, I work mostly in Mac mode, having largely abandoned PC mode, which I keep around only for old docs and images and for work purposes, the fix for Mac is the one that doesn't work.By the way, after you've finished calibrating there's an option someplace--obvious--where one can set which kind of monitor to which one would prefer the profile be applied. There's a list, which I don't have at hand, but it appears at the end of the process, from which one can use from among three or four types. I seem to recall there was one for LED, which is different than and LCD. X-Rite notes that choosing one or another correctly will slightly improve performance. I'd hope and think so!!", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "DETAILED REVIEW; the performance of a i1Display Pro, at a bargain price", "Author": "howie", "ReviewID": "R1WK069YAT1F7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "in case you're wondering, this really is a i1Display Pro meter in disguise. lets lay all the cards out on the table. it's exactly the same hardware as i1Display Pro. only difference is the firmware that's inside has a slower measuring time (to match the lower pricing), and the profiling software that comes with, is watered down. but if you're intended to use this with a 3rd party Calibration software, there really is no reason NOT to get the colormunki instead of the i1Display Pro, since all you need is the hardware, which is exactly the same. the measuring time isn't that much slower than the i1Display Pro. in fact, i was shocked how fast the readings took. i came from Spyder 2, Spyder 3, which took 5 times longer than what this thing takes for each luminance reading.Pro:it's fast, and \"supposedly\" accurate in measuring low luminance. Since i have no way of comparing it with a $28,000 CS-2000 Spectro meter; again, i did my research before purchase. and most tend to agree in its dark accuracy. in fact, i was able to get a reading of 0.013 cd/m2 (that's 0.0037 fL) out of my Samsung 60ES8000 in micro dimming mode in 0% IRE gray scale full field test, which dims the backlight to the minimum in dark areas. i don't know if it can read any lower than that. if i turn the backlight completely off, it wasn't able to take the reading. so i am not sure if it has any room between completely off vs what i got. maybe someone with a high end plasma can chime in and comment.the meter is pretty consistent across the board. the resulting delta E is very consistent. you might get a bigger variation due to screen uniformity rather than meter reading. i used it on one high end Samsung HDTV 60ES8000 (the highest consumer model in 2012), one 27\" Apple Cinema Display monitor, and a macbook pro. for both the 27\" monitor, and the laptop i used the included Xrite profiling software, which is easy to use and quick. the whole process took 5 mins.Speed. the measuring speed is fast. i believe the 0% IRE black took about 6 seconds max, while the rest of the 10~100% IRE gray scale took anywhere between less than 1 second to 2 second each. so it's surprisingly fast. due to this, i was able to do real-time calibration with ease by taking real-time readings in HCFR and adjust the white balance and CMS accordingly to get to the reference target point on the CIE chart for my Samsung HDTV.the meter is supported by quite a few 3rd party calibration softwares such as HCFR, and it needs no additional HCFR meter driver. it works right out of the box with HCFR with the provided Xrite driver. make sure you disable Xrite system tray icon, otherwise HCFR won't recognize the meter.Display type supported. the Colormunki Display supports most of the display technology out there, CRT, CCFL LCD, White LED, RGB LED, wide gamma, and projectors. this is very important. i came from Spyder 3, which supposedly supports White LED, but the result was poor.Con:the supplied Xrite profiling software does not include a ICC profile manager that allows you to instantly load, and change different profiles like Datacolor does. so you'll have to go into windows \"color management\" yourself and do it from there. make sure that you go into Advanced panel, and \"change system default\", load up the profile of your choice, \"set to default\" AND click on \"advance\", and MAKE SURE you enable \"Use Windows Display Calibration\". this last step will tell windows to use your choice of profile and load it up in the LUT everytime you enter windows. without this last step, your profile won't load.Additional Comment:i see some negative reviews on this product from users who got very brown/yellow looking results. let me just say this. if your equipment (monitor/TV) is already subpar. a colormeter won't be able to change that. as most laptops come in cheap TN panels with very poor color representation, my Macbook Pro (cheap TN panel) also came out brown and yellow, and there's nothing you can do. a colormeter is suppose to improve your panel to get it to near perfect, but if the panel is already bad to begin with, which most laptop panels are. you're not going to get the result of a perfect color by using a cheap subpar panel. my HDTV (S-PVA panel) came out great after the calibration, and so did my 27\" Cinema Display (S-IPS, which was already quite accurate right out of the factory, that produced a pre-calibrated reading of less than 3 delta E already. after the calibration, i was able to get the delta E down to 0.38. so bare this in mind when shopping. my advice is, if you're going to be using this on a cheap TN panel, don't get your hopes up too high, you might be better off saving the money for a better panel instead of putting your money in a Colormeter.Closing Comments:if budget is of concern, get the Xrite Colormunki Display. if not, get the i1Display Pro, which has a even wider range of 3rd party software support, and a more advanced factory profiling software. but i would definitely NOT go any lower than this Colormunki Display, and stay away from most of the Spyder from DataColor. you'll save a few bucks, but the result will be lesser than what the colormunki/i1Display Pro can produce.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dark", "Author": "Derek", "ReviewID": "R2CQ4HSSUGIV2U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I do a lot of photography and needed something for true color and consistent prints.

Another pleasant surprise: the software does not require a serial number.The software leads you over simple step by step procedures to capture the ambient light and calibrate your monitor(s) and/or projector.First, it captures the ambient light conditions; for this it tells you to put the built-in diffuser in position (a sensor tells it that it's in place and it won't proceed unless the ColorMonki is properly configured).It then displays a target to position the ColorMunki on, hanging the cord over the monitor and using the counterweight attached to the cord to hold it in position. This step takes about 6 minutes.When this step is complete, the profile is calculated (this takes a few minutes) and you are given a chance to review the results before setting it as the default for your monitor.Finally, the ColorMunki software offers you the option to remind you to recalibrate your monitor at regular intervals, and also to use the ColorMunki as an ambient light sensor to automatically adjust your monitor to ambient light conditions, a really neat feature.The software is very polished, especially considering it's a 1.0.1 version.

I decided even though this product was pretty expensive that it would be a good investment in my hobby.The product was easy to set up.  Make sure you download the latest software off their web site, the software that was bundled with the device was not the most current.  The first time I ran the x-rite, I did the basic mode.  My results were less than desirable.  My display ended up with a very red tone.  I opened Photoshop and created a blank white document and it was anything but white!  I was quite disappointed.  After doing some research, I came across a website that was a HUGE help.  Do yourself a favor and do a Google search for \"damiensymonds\".  Last I checked it was the first result on the search.  This site walks you though how to set up your workstation for the x-rite, and how to walk through the advanced calibration of the unit.  There are several choices and knowing how each one impacts the results you get is critical.  After downloading the newest version of the software and running through the advanced calibration, my monitor results are outstanding.  Colors are truly more realistic.  Blacks are really blacks, and whites are now actually white (imagine that!).  Be patient when running the calibration.  It can take about 5-8 minutes to complete the cycle.I also calibrated my MacBook pro with this device (yes, you can use the x-rite on as many devices as you like) and the results for the MacBook are just as good.  Although when I look at the same picture on the two monitors they don't look exactly the same (the MacBook is slightly brighter and a bit more saturated) they are very close and much improved over the results I was getting before the x-rite was used.I use Red River Paper for my prints. Their paper is top notch quality.  Their web site also offers free printer profiles for each of their types of papers, and there great step by step instructions on how to use their profiles.  Now my prints are outstanding and very close to how they are displayed on the monitor (you'll never get exact matches, but if you know what to expect between monitor and prints, then you should be able to get the output you want).The x-rite is not a cheap investment by any means, but if you're serious about getting the best prints out of your printer, and true to life display on your monitor then this product is excellent.

It wasn't clear whether the Spyder4Pro supports multiple computers. The product description says that it supports multiple displays but nothing is mentioned about multiple computers.2. At the time I made the purchase, ColorMunki Display had a mail-in rebate going on.3. Another reviewer said that the hardware is really the same as i1Display Pro which comes highly recommended.Now about the product. The hardware is really sleek and sits comfortably on the screen without scratching it. I did not install the software from the CD that came with the product, I installed the latest version from Xrite website. There is a prompt for registering the software but it's not mandatory and I recommend skipping it until you're sure that you're not returning the product. It can automatically identify if you've more than one displays. There're two calibration modes offered, \"Easy\" and \"Advanced\". In the \"Advanced\" mode, it lets you choose the White Point and Brightness a.k.a. Luminance. If you are unsure, just go with the industry recommended setting of D65 (6500 K) and 120 cd/m2 respectively. At some point, it asks you the backlight type for your monitor which you'll do good to know because that helps create a more accurate profile. It also asks if you'd like to measure the ambient light and screen flare. Then the software guides you through the process using a set of easily followable onscreen instructions. At the end of the process, which takes about 5 minutes, it creates a custom display profile and saves it. Finally, it shows you several stock pictures to compare the newly created display profile and the default display profile.In my case, I calibrated a late 2011 MacBook Pro and a Dell U2312HM display. A brown hue was imparted on the MBP, while the Dell display was calibrated satisfactorily. There wasn't a world of difference as some other reviewers claimed but I guess that is a subjective opinion. I recalibrated the MBP under different light conditions and at different times of the day but the end result always had the brown hue. I returned the product and got the Spyder4 Pro which fared pretty well compared to the ColorMunki Display.There are some reports of the software having a memory leak on Mac OS X and increasingly claiming more memory if the computer is left running for days. However, I left my computer running for 2 days but did not see more than 20 MB used by the software when idle.

There is NO way, short of wasting a bunch of money on prints, to guess why your monitor looks so much different than your prints. The ColorMunki solves the problem by accurately calibrating you monitors based on the ambient light in the room where you edit your images.I taught college level Photoshop classes for 14 years - from intro to advanced classes and have been a BETA tester for Adobe - the number one biggest issue the student were struggling with was getting their monitor to match the output of their printer! Most people handle this process backwards! They try to get the printer to match their monitor(s). Here's the problem: printers are sort of mindless beasts. Most printers have a limited ability to be adjusted. Monitors, on the other hand, can be adjusted easily and accurately.The second biggest problem is the effects of ambient light and reflections in the monitor. I would tell my students to try and work in the exact same lighting every time they were editing their images. That can be problematic. The X-Rite ColorMunki will solve a host of these problems! It's easy to set up and easy to use. The results are worth the price of admission!

Chien", "ReviewID": "R20Z2WPZJUW8GQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Lenovo Z580 with Intel graphics & i5 CPU, LED backlit display.Computer geek and well-read on color management and calibration.Intel driver settings were at full default, all color calibrations done through Windows Color Management Calibration software removed from the c:\\windows\\system32\\... directory and system reboot and verified at stock prior to installing and running this.Installed the driver, plugged in the ColorMunki Display, ran through the basic calibration at 6500k (matching color temp of HDTV), gamma 2.2, no auto ambient compensation. Brightness set at 2nd down from max (about 130 lux or whatever it was measuring vs. ideal of 120. 3rd down from max would have been about 102.).As I've seen before, the display went 'warm' - which means everything has a yellow/orange hue to it. This mis-calibration has occured before using other 'monitor calibration' hardware on other systems/monitors, so it wasn't a big surprise (but no idea as to why some hardware combos calibrate nicely; others don't). Definitely nowhere near accurate - even next to a Photodisc test target printed and viewed under high CRI lamps, not even close to matching the print.Took everything out. Sat the computer next to an IPS Panasonic TV (I'm trying to calibrate for video, so obviously, all modern HDTVs are calibrated to match the 6500k Rec709 standard, though most require some added calibration and tweaks for the very best accuracy). Hooked up a Hauppage WinTV950 to the laptop. Set both on the same HD TV channel. Ran through the Windows Color Calibration by hand, didn't touch gamma or brightness (at 2nd down from brightest), Adjusted the blue channel until the grays and faces matched. Yes, things were 'warmer' than default (too cold/blue), but nowhere as bad as the ColorMunki calibration.Videos and photos (Photodisc test target) now both look very realistic and accurate (vs. Photodisc test target especially, but matching the HDTV quite well despite the smaller color gamut of the Z580's TN screen). Far better than what the Munki achieved.Is this broadcast Rec709/6500k accurate? Keep in mind the problems here. The IPS panel likely displays close to or at least the full Rec709 color space - the TN panel on the Z580 is likely going to display 50-70% at best. Even after 'perfect' calibration, the TN panel will still not 'look just like' the ideal Rec709 color space monitor since many of the colors can't even be displayed on the TN panel. However, the eye is very good at distinguishing minor color differences across a wide range of video material when both are side by side, so hand-calibrating the TN panel against the IPS TV will put the Z580 at a 'decent' starting point for viewing and editing videos without spending $$$ (which would actually require one to buy at least the Y580 which has an IPS panel with larger color gamut). Additionally, the Rec709 is for most intents, same as the sRGB space, so when comparing the monitor against a printed Photodisc test target, if both match well in addition to the TV, then the eyeballed calibration is pretty 'good' for the basics of video editing.The Z580 is running a touch unsaturated at the default calibration done this way, so a +5 Saturation in the Intel drivers bring back a bit of the 'pop' one expects, especially when watching movies like Star Trek Into Darkness.Is the Colormunki good for anything? Not sure - didn't do it out of the box here, and there's no point tweaking and going through zillions of trials just to get a 'better' calibration. One simply doesn't know even with all that tweaking done is the calibration 'accurate' against what we're trying to target? Didn't match the Photodisc test target printed as accurately as eyeballing the calibration through Windows, and definitely things look at whole lot better with the latter than using the Colormunki profile. (eg. even playing a slew of videos from Star Trek Into Darkness to 24, it's easy to see which of the color calibrations is the 'best and most accurate' - A/B'ing using the Windows Color Mgmt window to switch between default, eyeball calibrated, and ColorMunki calibrations)", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to use.", "Author": "Bonnie J.

Have now used the ColorMunki Display for three months and am very happy with the results with the ability to rebuild the profile quickly to the current ambient light as an added bonus.Set up is easy, but I suggest two first steps. 1) If applicable - check that you monitor's window profile is installed or else start by installing it in windows. 2) Download the latest software from xrite's home page.Using the software is easy and I have never needed to consult the manual. Maybe a little more intuitive for me because I am used to color calibration, but I am certain its a LOT easier than when I started calibrating with my first device.Was worried at first about the time it would take as this is one of the selling points for the more expensive Pro version. But its easily quick enough for anyone not counting the seconds.Results seem excellent. I double checked using alternative methods. Not science, but enough to make me comfortable that it does the job.The only limitation is that previous software allowed me to tweek more of my settings and check the individual results in the color spectrum - such as how true blue is my blue? This is not possible with the \"Display\" version, but probably something you need to get the Pro version to check. However, since the overall result seems excellent this is a minor issue for me. If photography was my living I would probably feel different as checking individual colors is an excellent way of checking if its time to get a new monitor.Even if I use very expensive monitors, I have stuck to the middle-of-the-road calibration devices, because they usually work very well and because my editing environment is not so stable that it makes any sense to eek out the last precision calibration (i.e. I sit by a desk that is lit partly by day light during day). Here the option to rebuild the current profile with a click of the mouse is a very welcome feature that I believe many semi-pro photographers etc. will benefit from.As someone else mentioned.
