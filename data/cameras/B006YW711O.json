Camera feels good in you hands, well built, love the screen and the HD video is up to par.  Video button is the best, it can pressed without having to switch the knop to video so you shoot stills and video very easily.  Home run for Canon!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon G1 X", "Author": "Don and Dorothy Stejskal", "ReviewID": "RPEUJ1R1SU8P6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product arrived in a timely manner.  The only problem was the camera case that was sent.  It was much too small to be of any use.  I contacted the seller (Celltime) and they agreed, saying that their supplier made a mistake.  Celltime shipped a different case which is perfect for this camera.The camera itself, Canon G1 X is GREAT.  I have another 'point and shoot' camera, which finally stopped working correctly, as well as a Canon 40D SLR.  The G1 X is a perfect companion to the 40D.I am VERY satisfied.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Two Problems, sent in for repair", "Author": "nightphotog", "ReviewID": "ROXITEETQ907F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My macro will not focus on close-ups, even after manually setting it to macro.  The video did not work, and would only take still photos while in the video setting.  Other than that, great wide high quality photographs, but it is a little too large for my side pocket in comparison with my past G3, G9 and G11.  Those last three cameras had a great macro and video.  I'm not really sure that the G1X was worth the extra $300.00.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.00", "Features": "4x Optical Zoom 28mm Ultra Wide-Angle lens with Optical Image Stabalizer\nCanon's newest HS SYSTEM with a 1.5-inch, 14.3 MP High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor with DIGIC 5 Image Processor (up to 128oo ISO)\n4GB Sd Card Included\nShockproof Weather Proof Case Included\nFull Cleaning Kit Included", "Name": "Canon Powershot G1 X 14.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Lens Full 1080p HD Video and 3.0-inch Vari-Angle LCD Deluxe Bundle With 4 GB Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) Memory Card, Digpro Compact Camera Deluxe Ca", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FAN5HcyWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006YW711O"}}
