{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This stuff works", "Author": "Maynard", "ReviewID": "R1FT8PZAQJKF7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the 8 camera system from USA Security listed here. I would have given five stars, but it's four for the product - not the firm.The company shipped out a package missing a power supply for the main DVR unit. However, when I wrote and called to complain, they immediately shipped out a replacement power supply without any trouble whatsoever. This firm seemed committed to resolving sales problems for its customers, and for that I'm grateful. I'd definitely buy from them again, and would recommend others purchase from the firm as well.The device works as advertised. Images from the cameras are straight 480i, and what's recorded is really about 320i, but then again - so what. I'm not making a movie, I'm recording video of the exterior of a property. I don't care about image quality, I care about having proof for insurance adjusters and law enforcement. I've installed about half the cameras and got the DVR working, so I can say for certain that it works as advertised.However, and here's why the fifth star is missing, the DVR system is based on Linux. It's clearly imported hardware from China. Unfortunately, the manufacturer doesn't include source code for the Linux portion of the product. Yet, that's a requirement of the GPL license agreement for Linux. Frankly, I doubt USA Security has any control over their Chinese manufacturers - they're likely just buying in bulk and selling an imported product. But they should know that if they could get their customers source code, folks like me just might improve it. I'll need the root password too.For the vast majority of potential buyers, this is not an issue. If you want a cheap 8 cam security system, this device will do the trick. But it sure would be nice if these manufacturers actually read and followed the license agreements of the Free Software they base their products upon. Following that license would actually benefit them and their customers as well.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to setup, great features!", "Author": "D. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2W25MUZGWWF85", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very complete kit, including a nice power box, pigtail wires, cables, cameras and great DVR and software.Cameras have nice resolution and good motion sensing.Took me just a few hours to setup the first 5 cameras.  Very easy setup, the software with the included mouse makes setup a snap, in no time I had it emailing me snapshots.I really like the snapshot on motion, it emails me jpgs from 2-3 active cameras at once.Overall great value with plug and play experience.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great System", "Author": "Byron", "ReviewID": "R231ZMKEAB7V3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this unit 7 months ago and I love it.  I operate a home daycare and buying these cameras have been the best investment hands down.  I consider myself mechanically inclined and all by myself, was able to hook up the cameras without much trouble.  The hook up of the equipment is pretty simple and it took me 2 days to hook them up.  The hardest part was running the wires through the attic but if you have help, I'm sure they can be set up in a day.After a day, one of the cameras stopped working.  I contacted the seller and he immediately sent me out a new camera with a prepaid box to ship the defective camera back.  I also contacted the seller before I bought this system and spoke with a woman and she took the time to explain the system to me and answered any questions I had.  That was the main selling point for me.  Customer service now days is ridiculous and I appreciated the time she took explaining everything to me and the promptness of the return of the defective camera.I did have problems hooking up the cameras to the internet.  I am not very computer literate, so I had Geek Squad come out and try to hook it up but he had problems also. Apparently, the user login kept asking for a password that was never created and the only way to obtain that password was to contact the vendor or manufacturer.  I checked YouTube and was able to figure out that the password was password.I normally only buy products off of Amazon by ratings and this product did not have a rating at the time of my purchase but I am glad that I took a chance.  Unfortunately, the other person who gave it a 1 star was commenting on a different item.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Peter Moss", "Author": "Peter Mosten", "ReviewID": "R2JUJZE8NHGXP5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Q-see is one of the worst company I've ever dealt with.I purchased their product and couldn't get it to work.I emailed the company many times before I received anyacknowledgement.
