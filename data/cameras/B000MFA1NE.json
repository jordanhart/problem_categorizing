I don't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera, it does most of the work!  I like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not ISO, aperature, and all that jazz.  The settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true.  The digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry.  There are so many features on this camera, too many to list.  I even found a great deal at Best Buy on a 2 gig memory card, I get  over 1,000 photos with a high resolution!  It takes alkaline batteries, but I bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time.  I am sooo happy with this camera, I take it with me everywhere, even a couple of days to work.", "Date": "March 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Had second thoughts....", "Author": "T.

For about $200, you get the great resolution and GREAT color, compact size, and usability you need with 15 kids running around you at a party!  You will, of course, immediately need a memory card before using it (the one in the package serves up about 8 pics!) The SanDisk memory cards are supercheap, and I bought both a 1 and 2 GB version, both of which work great (2GB will hold about 1,000 pics...plenty). The program for your computer can be a little clumsy to load, but within 20 minutes I had the program and all my recent pics all loaded into my computer.Awesome for the price, and unless you are a professional photographer looking to get published in National Geographic, you cannot beat the value priced A550 for 7.1 megapixels and the Canon name.

This camera has proven to be that and much more!  What impresses me the most is the astounding battery life and the quick focus features. It is at an excellent price point as well. Our pictures no longer suffer from the dreaded 'redeye' effects. I upgraded from a 4 year old Olympus4 megapixel camera and am blown away by the improvements over that period.Canon rocks!", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Point & Shoot Digital Camera under $200", "Author": "Goanna", "ReviewID": "R2MR5N2M2N50FA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm going to write a positive review of this camera, but you should know that I ended up returning it to Amazon because it didn't meet my specific needs.I was looking for a high quality, inexpensive point and shoot digital camera when I bought this item. The reasons I returned it had nothing to do with the quality of its prints.  Let me make sure I say this: they were outstanding.  I loved the ease at which the A550 makes beautiful pictures.What didn't do it for me was the size, and the lack of a panoramic mode.  The camera I ended up with, the $300 Canon SD700, is just so small that I slip it  into my pocket without thinking about it.  With the A550, I could never forget it was there.  This bulkiness lead to me not carrying it all the time, which led to pictures not being made that otherwise might have been.  If I had a purse though, or I just wanted something to take on occasional outings, the A550 would have been perfect.  If this is you, then get this camera.Lastly, I got excited about the 4x optical zoom.  Don't.  Bottom line is that, if you want to really zoom in but be able to take sharp photos, you need to invest in a SLR or DSLR camera system.  When I zoom in with the A550, even with my steady grip, pictures often come out quite blurry.Hope this helps.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "The winning \"value for money\" camera from Canon!", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R23OXAHN61R014", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is simply a great camera to get whether you are buying a digital camera for the first time or the fifth time. Why? Because you get all the Canon quality and features for a very good price. At this price you can afford to even gift it to a teenager who wants to learn a little more photography as it offers a little more than just point and shoot.I've owned about 4 A series cameras in the past, along with S2/S3 series and SD series and I still recommend A series as the best value for money based on its performance. I tried this particular camera when I bought it recently for a gift.  Although the size of A series cameras is bigger than SD series making them jacket-pocket cameras, the advantage is in the styling. It gives you a convenient grip on the side which helps hold the camera steady and results in less \"blurry\" pictures than SD. The mode selector dial on top helps you zip through selections from portrait, landscape to nightshot and special scenes. The convenience of AA batteries which are available in every corner of the world, no missing out on pictures as your battery was discharged, is a great convenience. You can buy 2NiMH batteries with a charger like I did, and never have to buy any more again. The screen is only 2 inch (up from 1.8 earlier) but it makes the camera more durable, as the design makes it more resistant to damage.And what about the features? :- It has an intelligent 9 point focusing system with auto red eye correction which means it can choose the focus pretty accurately, although it also gives you the flexibility to choose the focus through 3 modes. (Centered, Evaluative, Spot)- SD card/MMC card slot - These cards are so cheap now so get the 2GB to store a whole vacation's worth of pictures.-Pic size- You can choose from 6 sizes for the pics including a widescreen 16:9 format which can be viewed on your HDTV.-Speed Dial: This dial on top allows fast spinning between shooting modes (night, landscape, indoors, kids, portrait, movie, auto, manual, special) so you never miss a shot. For this feature alone, I'd prefer an A series over SD as I keep missing shots on SD series while trying to change modes through the menu. With this dial even a kid becomes a pro. The SCN(special scenes) mode has Fireworks, Foliage, Beach, Snow, and Night Scene. Now even amateurs can use Canon experience to get the best shot. Fireworks is particularly amazing as it produced some great 4th of July shots. This camera does not have the Photostitch mode found on some other cameras but it does have the macro mode to take close ups.-Special effects (B/W, Sepia, Vivid, Nuetral etc.) I've used sepia a lot when taking potraits giving them an 'old world' feel. Vivid has been helpful in special situations like a red kite against a blue sky to bring out the colors. You can do this in Photoshop later but how many of us actually get the time to do this, once a pic is taken it's over with for me! This camera does not have the color accent/color swap option which is available on some other Canons.-You can set white balance manually on this camera or manually adjust shutter or aperture priority. It also has an optical viewfinder which is handy for very dark/very bright situations.-You can also take videos in 3 different resolutions with this camera and edit them right on the camera.-The zoom button shows one or many images at a time in the replay mode and you can zoom into each individual image to see parts of it closely.- While replaying, the images auto-rotate to landscape or portrait mode to align with how you're holding the camera. It's a nice feature as otherwise you can't see the portrait shots properly in the landscape mode.This camera makes a great first camera, with many features, and the image quality is superb. Especially if you are shooting outdoors the images are unsurpassed by any other brand, in my opinion. So go get it, at this price it's well worth getting it as a second camera for another member of your family during the vacation. You won't mind taking this one on the ride where you'd be scared to take your more expensive cameras!", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot A550 is a solid budget camera", "Author": "www.kdsgrp.ulmb.com \"Ken Everett\"", "ReviewID": "RPM2B2WNEGY8U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Canon's PowerShot A550 is a simple, inexpensive 7-megapixel camera, and that's all it wants to be. While it has some nice features, it doesn't offer any outstanding, unique aspects that put it above any other camera in the field, and that's just fine. Good performance and solid images are all a camera needs to succeed, and the A550 delivers just that.Though not quite small enough to slip into your jeans, the A550 is still comfortably compact. At 7.4 ounces and 1.7 inches thick, the camera can fit easily into most jacket pockets and bags. The camera's body has an L-shaped design found on most of Canon's PowerShot A series, giving it a generous grip. The buttons are large and comfortable, and they're laid out logically along the back and the top of the camera.The A550 is a fairly nondescript camera, with few outstanding or unusual features. Its most notable attribute is its 35mm-to-140mm-equivalent 4X zoom lens, which gives it just a bit more range than the 3X lenses typical of most budget cameras. It has a smaller-than-usual 2-inch LCD screen that is augmented by an optical viewfinder for shooting in dim light. Besides those features, the A550 has the standard handful of scene presets and image adjustment settings, including a 30fps VGA (640x480) movie mode and a pleasantly unexpected 60fps QVGA (320x240) high-speed movie mode. Finally, like most Canon PowerShot A-series cameras, the A550 conveniently takes AA batteries.The A550 performed well in almost all of our Labs' tests. After its brisk start-up time of 1.5 seconds, we could snap a shot once every 1.7 seconds, a great improvement over previous PowerShot A5x0 cameras. Unfortunately, with the onboard flash enabled, that time more than tripled to 4.9 seconds per shot. The camera's shutter was responsive, lagging less than 0.5 seconds with our high-contrast target and a modest 1.2 seconds with our low-contrast target. Burst mode was also pleasantly fast, managing 51 full-resolution shots in 31.4 seconds for a rate of 1.6 frames per second.Photos looked pretty good, though they're marred by overprocessing and fringing in spots. Colors reproduce well, though indoor photos shot with automatic white balance come out very yellow, a common problem for most snapshot cameras. Noise is low up to ISO 400 sensitivity, where a fine grain starts to appear. Images are predictably noisy at ISO 800 sensitivity, with speckling damaging fine details and softening colors. ISO 800 is usually reserved for low-light and high-speed shooting, and everyday snapshots shouldn't have many problems.With quick performance and decent photos, the Canon PowerShot A550 is a solid budget camera. It doesn't have many special features and it's not particularly small or light, but it's a strong choice if you don't want to spend a lot for your snapshots.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera!", "Author": "Missy Ingram", "ReviewID": "R2FMSUNKOJLNHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip my husband and I took to Scotland and England in May.  Since this was our first digital camera, I researched many different brands and decided on this one because of the price, the actual pictures other users had uploaded and the reviews.  We were not disappointed at all!  It was so easy to use - we just left it on auto and it chose all the perfect settings - we've also gotten so many compliments on the quality of the pictures!  We used a 2gb memory card and chose lithium batteries.  We took over 400 pictures and didn't fill up the card and didn't wear out the batteries which is excellent considering we were gone for 12 days!!

Graham", "ReviewID": "R3RX01PM6XE3BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to have a Point and Shoot available when the occasion doesn't call for a full blown 9-10 megapixel DSLR-type like my Fuji S9000. Fujifilm Finepix S9000 9MP Digital Camera with 10.7x Wide Optical Zoom  The Canon shoots amazingly fast and produces a large format photo right out of the box.  I like the Canon menu tree - it's easy to know where you're going for settings.  The LCD is bright and crystal clear.  The Canon DIGIC II electronics are worth Googleing and reading about.The selling point that persuaded me to buy the A550 7.1MP is the TTL Optical (Through The Lense) vuefinder.  Most other PnS cameras leave you with only a LCD screen to vue through...I find them awkward and not true when composing a shot.SD media is the most inexpensive and available on the market.  The A550 can use SD, SDHC and MMC.  A couple 1Gig pieces should serve you well, the faster writing the better - DON'T SKIMP HERE.  A slow writing media card will bother you eventually.Arm yourself with 3 or 4 changes of rechargeable batteries and go shoot the world, or at least try.  Read your Manual - download one from the Canon site to browse while on the computer.

I had a Canon Powershot A80 and liked the picture quality  but it broke after three years of use. The A80 was quite expensive at that time so I hesitate to get another point-and-shot that priced at the higher-end. We are very satisfied with the price, the picture quality, and the functions of the A550. The only shortcoming of the A550 I noticed so far is that the recharge of the flash is quite slow (even with full battery) so there is a longer-than-usual wait time before you can take the next picture after using flash.", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera!", "Author": "A. Kite \"boardgirl148\"", "ReviewID": "RBMHF8NWJMG80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a new camera to replace my very old digital camera, so I ordered this one and could not be happier with it.It has all kinds of features, including some manual control options like white balance, etc. for those people who like to mess with that stuff (I'm more of an Auto person, myself).  I used it on vacation last month and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of pictures, after taking only a few test shots to get familiar with the camera.  The camera is very easy to use and gives you a basic user manual to get you started, and also a detailed manual to help you find out how everything works on the camera.  The movie mode works good, too.  The colors come out bright and vivid.  The lag time between pictures is minimal, which is one of the main things I hated about my old 1.3mp Panasonic Palmcam, and the 7.1mp makes for some excellent detail in your pictures.  The only bad thing about the camera, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a movement stabilizer (or whatever it is called), so it can be prone to shaking, especially when you zoom using the digital zoom.  I like that the camera is small and lightweight, but it is not one of those super thin ones that you feel like you could break in half.Overall, I think this is a GREAT camera, and I don't think you can find a better camera for the price.", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for novice user", "Author": "Ken Ng", "ReviewID": "R1NY760G5BO0A6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera for people like me who just want ease of use, low price and take some reasonable decent pictures, but does not have much time or knowledge to evaluate the different cameras.

You can switch from taking shots to review with one click of a button and back again to taking photos.

Goodenow", "ReviewID": "R23HNO3DCX8D8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the A550 as a light backup for an extensive Olympus DSLR system. There are times when one wants a small camera just for snapshots or backpack, but more importantly for me, I want a 'safety net' that is easy to use, produces good results and uses a common power supply. Hence, after a lot of shopping around I purchased the 550.First, as a bottom line, the camera produces excellent results, even in its most simple 'point and shoot' mode. Images are sharp, clean and properly exposed (more reliable than my Oly dslr's), even when there is some backlighting present. It has a manual feature which permits exposure compensation, ISO selection and other settings. Its movie capabilities are impressive. It has an optical viewfinder for power saving and those situations where it is too bright to use the lcd for composition. The camera fires up quickly and it has easy to use menus that provide many options.My Olympus cameras all use a proprietary battery system that requires I haul around a charger and a couple of backup batteries. But they are power hogs. The A550 takes off-the-shelf AA alkaline batteries available anywhere. I use rechargeable Sanyo Eneloops or Rayovac hybrids and, frankly, I have no idea of how many photos I can take because I have never run them down. My guess is a couple of hundred shots using the lcd, maybe three or four hundred without. That's a lot of photography. A heck of a safety net. At a time when TSA is starting to restrict how many lithium camera batteries one can pack I say kudos to Canon for keeping a fine line of cameras running on both AA's and SD cards, rather than the miserable xD's preferred by Olympus and Fuji for their compacts.There are some other things I like. The camera has an optical zoom feature, which is generally pretty useless on most cameras. The A550s isn't brilliant, but I do find I can extend the telephoto maybe 50-100mm without too much loss of sharpness, cutting my need to manually crop later. I also find that I do not need to use it at its lowest compression to get excellent results up through 8x10\" prints. Slap in a 2 meg SD card and you're good for well over a thousand shots.Quibbles. Of course there are always some. The flash unit takes up to 10 seconds to recycle, and the lcd isn't the sharpest kid on the block. And, I truly wish that Canon would give its compacts a bit more wide angle capability. 35mm is fine for most situations, but 28mm would be great for those of us who do landscapes and cityscapes. The sliding battery/memory card door is a tad on the flimsy side, but overall, the camera is well built.I understand that Canon has upgraded the 550. The 560 includes face recognition and other new features which I really don't care much about, but doubtless add to the functionality of the camera. At the end of the day I am very satisfied with what I have, and if you can find one at a rock bottom price (somewhere in the vicinity of $115-20) you just cannot go wrong.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "WOW Good Camera for the money", "Author": "Dan Balmer D.

Surprisingly this camera for the 150.00 we spent is very good. There is some minor distortion (grain) on some photos that the camera pushed to extreme auto ISO settings, but for normal point and shoot, you can't beat this for the money. The controls are well laid out and easy to use, even quickly without having to page through settings. The Auto setting works great for 90% of the photos shot, and then the other settings work even better. I shot my kids outdoors during sunset and into the night with the KIDS AND PETS setting and got awesome still mid air shots of them diving off the diving board in the dark! The flash caught them and the shutter speed was fast enough to freeze the action even in the dark. The movie mode was grainy in the dark-which is to be expected, but quite usable under normal circumstances. I have used Picasa software (free download) to store my shots and the only real editing I have been doing is sharpening them in the dark photos. Other than that, everything has been pretty good on its own. I am picky on using cameras and for the cost of this one, I can't complain. It fills a much needed void. My only complaint is I wish it had a bit more zoom (maybe 5x instead of 4)and a slightly wider angle for wide angle shots, but that's being extremely picky.

Anyway, while searching for a replacement (and there are many to chose from these days) I stumbled upon Ocean Reef Electronics here on Amazon who was offering the same camera for...wait for it...$25! It was a refurb (their specialty I assume) so with some hesitation I took a chance and pushed the button. Only two days later the camera arrived and holly-cow, it's the spit'n image of the one I lost (did I mention I wished it was my ex-gf that would have fallen out of my truck instead? Ok, I digress..). This one looks 99.99% brand new--you'd never guess it was a refurb--what a deal! I paid a little over $120 for this camera way back when and now I have it back from the abyss (where lost cameras go I assume) for only $25! I tell ya it was like having an undo button for my life!! I love this camera and I'm ever so thankful to Ocean Reef Electronics for making this reunion possible--not to mention their crazy-quick service (TWO DAYS !!!).Now, if I could only click \"undo\" on this girlfriend problem....say, I wonder if Ocean Reef could refurb my....nah, probably not.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Avoid this seller!", "Author": "Overseas", "ReviewID": "RXVZB566PGIAH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We ordered this camera for our daughter.

I got this message after only 6 months of use. I was not hard on the camera and I never dropped it. It did not get wet  nor did I take it anywhere that got it dirty.

I own 4 cameras from the A series.A520, A530, A540 and A550 and I am happy with all these cameras and here are the reasons why.1. Value for Money, I bought all these under $200.2. 4x Optical zoom is a plus and sufficient for a point and shoot camera.3. Delivers fairly good quality pictures. I have printed poster size pictures and have been very happy with the results.4. All these have better manual controls than most of the ELP series point and shoots canon has made.Cons:one thing to keep in mind is that these cameras are point and shoot and the lower end models that canon has made, so anyone buying these should not have high expectations with these cameras.1. Delay between two shots when flash used. Again this is marginal and I really do not think of this as a major -ve point, at least not for the money spent on these.2. The ELPHs have made them look bulkier :) again not a biggie. The ELPHs are really compact. So even though these are not as big, they look big in front of elphs.I would not recommend A550 to anyone only because they are old models, not because they are not good. Instead I would recommend the latest A series models that Canon has come out with. A720 IS, A570IS, A590IS.

Also, the default ISO settings for video recording are very grainy and look horrible. If you're looking to replace the A530, I wouldn't recommend this camera.

Compared with similar digitals it's as good or better. Ken Rockwell waxes enthusiastic about it on his website, but then his photos usually aren't made under difficult conditions. If you need something like this, it's a good value. For closeups and middle distance shots, under good lighting conditions, the resolution is acceptable, particularly on a computer monitor.

We also have a Sony SLR type Digital camera that is in a totally different league and we have a lot of fun with it. We also own a very nice 35mm SLR, and have taken some published photo's. But I wanted something to carry around when ever I get out, or to use to take close ups for E-Bay. The macro on the Canon A550 has way too much contrast, and actually made a very expensive Sambar Stag Knife look plastic. Low light situations where not great, photo's always seemed too grainy unless the pictures where shot in good to bright light. There was also a very noticeable curvature in the macro mode, close ups, and wide angle shoots. I took the camera out and took some photos of a near by lake, and the zoom did a nice job, but once it went passed the 4X optical zoom things got grainy fast.I guess for someone who just wants to have fun with a digital camera and doesn't care too much about color accuracy this is probably a nice little camera.
