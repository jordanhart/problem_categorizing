{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So Much Canon Goodness Packed Into This Tiny Fella!", "Author": "Marc Jordan \"Marky Da'  Saint\"", "ReviewID": "R3C821SB1VE0IA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As we all know, Canon's S90 - S100 models have pretty much set the bar in The Advanced Point And Shoot market for the last 4 1/2 yrs... Until recently ( With the advent of The Sony RX100). Canon sales more cameras than almost all other brands combined, this does not indicate, however; that they are the best in all categories, but that they are either the best over all, or at least in the top 5 for most classes of cameras.  I have owned many Canon Cameras and printers over the years, and I have been very happy with most of them, but I also place a lot of stock in fellow Amazon customer's reviews. For many months, I noticed that every other review, or updated one, for The Powershot S100 indicated a nasty lens error.  That said, this time around researching advanced P&S;'s, I decided to see what other Brands such as: Nikon, Fuji, Panny and Sony were offering... What I found was this, Other brands have really took notice of The Canon S and SX line's success and or offering very stiff competition!  Sony has, IMHO, set the New Standard with the almost perfect Advanced P&S;, The RX100. My coworker owns one, and it stomps all others in this now crowded class! Only problem is that it cost over $650.00, but the image quality, and low light rendering are truely amazing! Needless to say, Sony discounts its products about as often as Apple discounts its products... NEVER! The Panny Lumix LX5 and LX7, Nikon P300 and P310 and Fuji X10, are all now offering very good to excellent image quality in this class. You saw correct! I did include The Nikon Coolpix P310!  Nikon has really stepped their game up with The Coolpix Line, in fact; this was the only model that came close to The Canon S100 and S110's Bang-For-Your-Buck. Price, it is $200 less than Canon S110, $450 less than The Sony RX100, while offering excellent I.Q., pocketabillity, low light performance and manual controls... Sans Raw mode. Came so close to getting The Nikon P310, before you judge me, just take a gander at the online sample shots of this camera!  In the end, I came back to The Canon S110.  Chose The newer S110 over The S100 in the hopes of avoiding The Lens Error (Fingers Crossed). So happy with this camera! The S110 looks identical to The S100, but let me tell you, Canon has made some huge improvements with The 110. Canon has improved upon the sensor and auto focus speed of this model, added usable ISO, WiFi and touchscreen functionallity. Low light performance is a lot like that of The S95 and S100 combined. Allow me to explain. Sometimes The S100's colors would be a little off in low light, casting an orangish hue... as if shot in sepia. The Powershot S95 rendered sharp, detailed and very accurate colors in lowlight, but the lens was a bit slow under these conditions.  I don't know what Canon did, but there is almost zero lag in AF, despite others claim that this is a slower lens or sensor than its predecessors. Color, contrast and sharpness are spot on! I predict that the next S model will have a larger sensor to be competitive with The Sony RX100's lowlight performance, but until then, I have to say that the S110 is very close in low light image quallity and will surpass the Sony, although at the cost of a higher price point and perhaps a larger form factor because of the larger sensor.  Battery life has never been an issue with me, because I rarely took over 100 pictures in a day and never used GPS tagging or logging. I also rarely shoot video clips longer than 10 min. in a day,also buy cheap aftermarket Batt.s as back-up. Canon's addition of WiFi to The S-Line is really cool and useful; I use it way more than I thought I would!  It is implemented very well with this camera, much smoother and faster than using Eye-Fi's top of the line card... That's an $80 dollar value right there! Lol  Also, I already own a Canon SX-230HS and many extra batteries. The S110 uses the same battery ( NBL-5) as The SX-230. Yes! Winning! WiFi connection with your smartphone or iPhone is almost instantaneous, once the App. is opened on the device, or printer turned on. GPS functions are combined with these WiFi transmissions between your phone and camera, and they are thus also instantanious.  The WiFi operates very efficently, and a cool, bright, blue LED lights up on the top of the camera when it is connected. It flashes when busy. The Camera asks if you would like to geotag or log your location while connected to your phone or computer. It is a 2 second affair, so GPS no longer drains your battery. Built-in GPS and Eye-Fi cards do not work nearly as seemless as this! I had issues when first setting this connection up, because I thought I could bypass the step where you connect the Camera to a computer via USB cable and run software CD...  You have to do this step! I think you may have to also Register your S110 for it to properly set up initial WiFi.  Touchscreen: Very Responsive, and can be adjusted.... Nuff said on that.  CONS: The things I don't like about The Canon Powershot S110 are pretty much all ergonomically based. These things are true of the entire S series, and perhaps the indicative of the entire Class of these type cameras. They are not easily handled or operated... even on Auto! EXAMPLE: A friend, family memb., or pedestrian says, \"Hey, YOUR NAME HERE, I noticed you are taking everyone else's picture, would you like me to take yours with the group?\" You have to explain that this really tiny, hard to press button turns the camera ON. When it turns on be careful, because the flash is going to come up over here. If you want to zoom in it's the tiny switch here next to the shutter button. Now, you only want to press the shutter button halfway to compose the shot... it'll beep when ready, then you push it all the way down to take the shot. See? Some ergonomic issues have gotten better with this version of The \"S\".... others the same or worse. 1. Front grip is gone. 2. As on all The S Models, power button is way too small and recessed. 3.Mode wheel blocks index finger from shutter button. 4.Flash makes camera hard to handle with left hand. 5. if touchscreen shutter is on, camera will take picture if finger contacts screen before you are ready. I guess some things have to be sacrificed for a small form factor, but I feel comfortable giving anyone my Canon Elph 300HS and it is the smallest P&S; ever produced!  There is no loud knocking noise when zooming in video, but there is a slight wherling sound when I zoom in video.  Hard to notice and can only be heard when passage is very quiet during playback, but it's there... none the less. Wish Canon would get that worked out. All and all EXCELLENT IMAGE QUALITY and cool added features, deffinately recommended! The White is very cool looking and although glossy does not show prints as much as I had anticipated.  The Black/Mat is sleek and modern looking like a stealth plane.... was a hard decision to make!  UPDATE: Have now taken close to 400 shots. Still going strong!  There are a few points that I should add to my review. Some I forgot, and some are new discoveries.  1. Wifi connection.: I own a Huawi Glory/Mercury Android smartphone which is still running Gingerbread. The S110 connects flawlessly with this phone, but what I found out is, you must be near an open WiFi network or hot spot for it to work. The Camera's Wifi will not work over 3G or tethered to your phones mobile hotspot. Also, The S110's WiFi will not connect wirelessly to Windows7 Basic,Starter or any OS older, such as XP or Vista. It won't work on Macs older than OSX 10 or whatever Apple's answer for Windows 7 was. I was told by a Canon Rep. that it works well with full versions of Windows 7, and extremely well with Windows 8. We will see. Waiting for Black Fri. to snag a Windows8 computer.  2. Touchscreen Shutter: Amazingly, the touchscreen functionallity of The S110  has really impressed my friends and family. It really comes in handy when I  give The S-110 to someone, in order to get in the picture myself or for  some one to swipe through the pictures, using their finger to preview.  3. Price Point: I purchased The Powershot S110 for $390 used, and it came  new, in box with all contents still sealed in plastic. Nice! The main reason  I purchased the S110 over the S100 was it was only $38 dollars more at that  time, and I felt that was a small Diff. to pay to hopefully avoid The Lens  Error. I really am happy with this little camera. The functions and menues  are very easy and quick to access with the lens ring and touchscreen. Before  I was using Auto way too much... Now, I am truely learning, in a fun easy way  about F-stops, apperature, ISO, white balance, shutter speed, etc.  Things  that I already kinda knew about with my Eos T3 and even my S95, but seemed  to much trouble or laborious, are now fun and easily implemented to play  around with. I am having, \"A Ha moments,\"  where I think aaah, that's why  that turned  out good or bad with my DSLR... The S-110 is the perfect learning tool to  whip out of your pocket, purse, or Camera Case and start learning and  capt-  uring. I also played around with The Canon G15 and G1X. Salesman at camera  store told me that G15 used pretty much the same sensor,lens and processor  as The Canon S100 and S110.  The Powershot G1X really impressed me with its  image quality though; seemingly better than even the more expensive, Sony RX  100! I understood why when he told me it had an SLR sized sensor. The G1X is  a beast, though! Holding it, it felt the size and weight of my T3 without the  lens! Way too large, but may be Canon's answer to The New Sony, Panny, Fuji  and Olympias in this class. He offered it to me at the same price as the G15  $550 plus Uncle Sam's cut (Tax), but it still was more than I could afford.  So here I am. A happy S110 owner.

LCD is bright and visible even in Florida sunlight.  Auto white balance seems pretty good.  The Auto function works surprisingly well choosing a scene mode and applying image parameters.  With the Auto mode, I have not witnessed any unexpected blown-out highlights and shadow detail is pretty good.  Image stabilization appears to work very well, perhaps 3 stops worth.  Conversely, wireless setup is a monster nightmare that involves Canon Gateway, registering, modifying your network settings and then just maybe it will work. After almost 30 minutes of tinkering,  I was able to transfer 16 photos to my laptop but it took almost 15 minutes to accomplish the transfer.  Much easier to just use a card reader and then upload photos to social media sites, email, etc.  Canon has not made this feature user-friendly.  I will not be using the wireless capability.Image Quality:  Very good up to 800 ISO - little noise, good detail, and color.  1600 is still good.  3200 perhaps for small prints only.Overall:  Good camera; however, Canon's engineers made the wireless curse-worthy.  Build quality, image quality, handling, ergonomics are all above average.  My only caveat involves the price...kind of pricey for a couple of features over the S100.  If you can find an S100 with a serial number above 42xxx (infamous lens error problem), you'll have basically the same camera as the S110 sans the touch screen and the wireless features at a much less expensive cost.  I plan to keep my S110 since it is so very pocket-able, fast, and puts out very decent images especially at lower ISO levels.  Canon states that the S110 has a newly designed lens.  I am just hoping they have rectified the frequent lens error problem of the S100.

line of cameras.  This Powershot S110 failed with a lens error during a family vacation - leaving me with just my lousy smartphone camera.  I had it for only 20 days when it failed.I've owned the S10, S80, S95, and now this S110.  With the exception of the S95, ever single model has had a lens error.  Until now I've just dealt with it (returned / repaired) because of the excellent image quality and features.  I can no longer ignore these lens issues and I will no longer be buying Canon cameras.  Frankly, I feel like kind of a fool for giving Canon so many chances.Do yourself a favor and search for Powershot lens errors.  Most importantly, don't ignore what you find!  This is a great camera when it works - which is why there are so many 5 star reviews.  Read the 1 star reviews to get an idea how common the lens error is - then decide if you want to take a chance on this camera.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "A solid enthusiast compact", "Author": "S. Vogt", "ReviewID": "R1JH8HNPRP2DHR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon Powershot S110 brings some key performance improvements as well as the touchscreen which makes this 4th generation S series camera probably the best yet.The photo quality from this camera is impressive considering its sensor size. If I was to be really nit-picky I would say that the sharpening in the JPEGs appears a little crude at times and the colors aren't as punchy or contrasty by default as they were in the S100. But color performance is still pretty good (I like the colors better than the ones from the Sony RX100), detail capture is very good, and ISO performance is excellent. At ISO 800 the camera does a very nice job balancing out detail retention and noise reduction and even ISO1600 photos look good as long as you're not blowing them up to huge sizes. Shooting RAW will help you wring out even more detail. Dynamic range is also quite good. The camera tends to overexpose in bright conditions and blow out highlights. Which is pretty typical for this class of camera. Taking everything into account though, I would say the S110 probably has the best overall image quality of any of the S-series cameras so far.Canon uses the same 5x F2-F5.9 lens as they did in the S100. It's unfortunate they haven't taken the opportunity to put a faster lens in this model because most of the competitors have much faster lenses on their cameras. That said, the lens is fairly sharp. It also zooms in and out fairly quickly.Sadly, the camera has lost the little indent on the front which helped give you a more secure grip. However, the surfaced is textured in such a way where you can still get a decent grip, and it's not slippery like the Sony RX100. The LCD screen is 460k dots, and while it's pretty decent, I think Canon should have taken the opportunity to upgrade the resolution with this model. The big update this year with the LCD is that it is now a touch screen. To be honest, it's not very practical for adjusting camera settings but does work extremely well for touch focus and touch shutter. It's a much better setup than having to go into the menu to adjust the focus area. The touchscreen overall, though, is very responsive and works well.The control ring up front remains on this model and is still excellent to use. With decisive clicks everytime you adjust something. You can of course customize the control ring up front to adjust a number of settings.As far as performance goes, shot to shot times are about the same as the S100 but autofocus performance has improved on this model. I wouldn't say the camera has blazing fast autofocus but it should be plenty quick enough in most shooting situations.As for the video, it is surprisingly good for such a small camera but is most suitable for short clips.This model has since been replaced by the newer S120. The S120 is a faster camera overall and has better video capabilities. Plus it has a slightly faster lens but still F5.7 on the telephoto end. I have also heard some say that the S120 is worse at high ISO but it appears about the same to me. If you're a still shooter who doesn't dabble into serious video shooting or need the extra burst performance, you can get the same photo quality and still respectable performance from the S110 at a much cheaper price.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lens Error on Day Two", "Author": "KK", "ReviewID": "RGM7O3RO082PZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife purchased after I did some research.

The Sony RX100 is probably the best subcompact camera but it costs twice the S110 price and is missing some key new features that separate it from the subcompact camera competition. I rated the S110 5 stars because it is a great subcompact camera at a great price. The price does fluctuate so watch for a good deal if you decide to buy.I upgraded my Canon S95 which is still working perfectly two years later after taking over 5000 images. The images I've taken with that camera rival the other more expensive digital cameras with larger sensors and lenses that I own.  It's one camera I always have with me. When you compare the S95 with the S110, they almost look identical. There are of course a few changes in the button layout and the surface appearance. Why change a successful camera?  The S110 is a tad heavier by a fraction of an ounce over the S95. The interface is the typical Canon interface and it's easy to find your way around. The separate video button is now standard on virtually all cameras today so that's not so special but it is nice to have.The S110 has many new and improved features that make this camera an even a better camera than earlier versions. The processor, sensor and zoom have changed but the basic camera shape remains the same. The things I like a lot that are either new or improved from the Canon S95. The biggest changes came in the S100 released a year ago. That model while improving on the S95 had some lens issues on a number of the cameras especially when it was first released. You can see some of the negative reviews list the problems. If you didn't have a bad lens, you probably loved that camera. Today it sells for more than the S110 which is surprising.The S110 has much faster autofocusing.  It allows faster image capture. New image processor. Here are some other things which add greatly to the user experience.1. Touch Screen interface. Helps in focusing on subject and faster setting things up.2. WiFi that replaces the GPS unit is not present on S95. There are many possibilities with this...3. F2 starts wider at 24mm instead of 28mm equiv.4. Wider zoom range 5X versus 3.8X. So its wider and with more telephoto.5. Better low light capability and a much expanded ISO range. Very high ISO images are possible.6. Expanded digital zoom up to 20X is surprisingly good but not typical super zoom quality.7. Many more manual and custom settings possible.8. Expanded compensation9. Slightly improved ergonomics with thumb rest and slightly rougher texture on the surface, allowing a better grasp. You still need the wrist strap  for safety reasons.10. Full high definition video, 1080P at 24FPS with separate video button.11. Slightly stronger flash.12. Excellent and expanded image stabilization. (Which is pretty good)13. Excellent image quality with the new CMOS sensor. Much better low light images.14. Many advanced features. (it does take time to try everything)15. Separate charger for the battery, allows charging second battery while using the other battery16. Has a new level meter to help keep your camera positioned correctly. It does help at times.17. Contains some self-help on the LCD that can be removed.The things that are not so great and that are not improvements.1. Smaller battery, the same as the earlier SD series. It means fewer pictures per charge. Two of my earlier Canon subcompacts used the same battery so I now have spares.2. Change from CCD to CMOS sensor brings some change in image quality and noise.3. Flash pop up location pushes finger and can startle an unsuspecting holder.4. HD video is MP4 and allows less video footage but is easier to edit.5. Still only a small starter manual. Manual is PDF and can be downloaded.6. No remote trigger. You can set delayed shutter snap at 2 or 10 seconds.7. Button placement is similar but different. The power button is harder to push. The shutter button is larger.8. The same popup flash that will hit your finger if you don't change your left hand position.9. Build quality is very good but is not at the level of the Sony RX100. It is a combination of metal and plastic. Does feel very solid.10. As you zoom out to about 100mm, the F stop is over F5 and not so great for low light. You may need to raise the ISO to get an image.If you do decide to buy this camera or the Sony RX100, Panasonic LX7, you will not want to retire your dSLR, or Super zoom or whatever because those cameras offer features not possible with a very small camera without viewfinder. The Canon S110 is truly pocket-able and at the current price is half the price of the Sony RX100 making this camera seem like a best buy in the subcompact field. A subcompact camera is a must have camera because, you can carry it everywhere. The current crop of smartphones can take a decent images for the internet but don't come close to the image quality or convenience of the Canon S110 and other subcompact cameras.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Len Error on arrival", "Author": "Positron \"Positron\"", "ReviewID": "RJFR7TVQ3OEAY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received the camera, charged the battery, powered on for the first time and got the \"Lens Error\" message.

My regular camera is a Nikon D300s with the battery grip and several lenses.  I have been looking for an easily portable camera to carry when I don't need or want the heavy gear.  My goal was to reproduce the functions of the DSLR in a small package and do it for under $400.  This review looks at my five most important DSLR functions and explains how they are reproduced in the S110.Shooting in Camera RawI always shoot my DSLR in RAW mode and custom crop and process every image.  It sounds like a pain, but thanks to automated features in programs like Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, it isn't a big deal and the results are worth it. If this is new for you, the difference between capturing a picture in JPEG and RAW is in the ability to further manipulate the images later.  For example, assume you have set your camera to use: 1) Auto White Balance, 2) No Exposure Compensation, 3) Medium Sharpening, and 4) produce the image in JPEG format.  The camera takes the picture, applies your settings and records it as a JPEG file.  If you shoot the same picture in RAW with the same settings, the camera notes your settings and may apply them to the thumbnail that it shows you, but what you download from the camera is the data collected from the sensor without the settings applied.  This is why pictures from a cheap point-and-shoot (P&S;) camera may look better out of the camera than pictures from a DSLR or advanced P&S.;  But, the trouble comes when your JPEG settings don't give you what you expected.  Suppose you get the pictures on your computer and they have a green cast from the lighting, they are under-exposed and under-sharpened.  If you shot them in JPEG, you may be out of luck without doing extensive fiddling.  If you shot them in RAW, you use your processing software's RAW converter and change the settings to what they should have been to give you the shot you wanted.  Basically, you adjust RAW images on your computer like your camera produces JPEG images in the camera.  The computer gives you more processing power, more sophisticated processing software, and the ability to change the settings until you get the image you want.  Combine this with the fact that JPEG compression will hurt image quality and RAW images come out of the camera uncompressed and you can see why shooting in RAW mode is more work, but can provide a much better outcome.  The primary reason for selecting any of the cameras in this class of advanced point-and-shoots is the ability to record images in RAW format.  If you plan to leave the camera in JPEG mode, you can save yourself some money, get a good camera, and get very nice pictures by choosing a different camera that takes only JPEGs.Front Control RingYou can assign 8 preprogrammed functions to the front ring.  I use the control ring to change the lens zoom settings.  The focal length changes in fixed steps of the standard prime lenses from 24mm to 120mm. I find the control ring works much faster than trying to frame with the zoom lever on the top of the camera.  After using a range finder and SLR cameras for years, it is natural to have this control on the front of the camera and I love the ability to program it with the push of a button.  I have been surprised by how this one feature simplifies shooting with the S110.Display InformationI don't know if I will ever get used to framing on the screen of a P&S.;  I prefer the \"real\" optical viewfinder of a SLR. But, none of the cameras in this class have an optical viewfinder, to get that feature you will pay another $100 and get a larger camera.  The S110's display gives me all of the information I get when using my DSLR and more.  When framing the shot, I see the battery level, shooting mode (e.g. RAW), the exposures remaining on my SD card, the length of video I could shoot, the flash setting, horizontal level, exposure compensation, f-stop, and ISO.  When I press the shutter button, the display clears at the top and then shows me the information on that shot along the bottom of the display: exposure meter mode, horizontal level, f stop (in aperture priority), exposure compensation, and ISO setting.Aperture Priority ModeCameras in this class will allow you to choose Aperture, Shutter, and Manual mode in addition to a bazillion scene settings.  Like my DSLR, I keep the S110 in aperture priority nearly all the time and use the back thumb wheel to change the aperture.  If you have read the reviews for this camera and the others in this class you know that you lose a lot of aperture range as you extend the zoom.  For example, the aperture range is f 2.0 to f 8.0 at 24mm and at 50mm the aperture range is f4 to f8.  The relatively fast lens helps get good pictures in low light situations.  The problem is that the relatively small sensor gives little control over the depth of field, again an issue with this class of cameras that is not unique to the S110.Exposure CompensationThe camera's meter is always a good place to start.  But, I often find that I need to increase or decrease the exposure to accurately capture the mood of the scene.  The exposure compensation process is simple with the S110; press the top of the rear control dial and rotate the dial to select the exposure increase or decrease.  The display then previews the shot with the new setting.If you have read the other reviews, you know that it is a good idea to buy a second battery.  I own at least two batteries for all my cameras, so I was not surprised or disappointed by the battery life.The S110 is not intended to replace your DSLR.  But, Canon has taken the DSLR's controls and wrapped them around a point and shoot sensor to give photographers a great small camera that they can carry virtually everywhere.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Preferred this over the RX100", "Author": "PieInTheSkie", "ReviewID": "R2IUJQ7ZMMKIA8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before any camera pro jumps on me for choosing the S110 over the RX100, let me first explain why:- I am not a photographer or even an amateur one. I want quality photos and video when I am out, but easy.- It has to be easy for my wife to use- It has to fit easily into a pair of jeans pockets- I do not print photos or do any touch-ups. What I get from the camera, is what I have.- I currently own a Canon S95 and love it - just do not like that its only 720p video and cannot zoom during video- The touchscreen is very useful and makes it easy to make sure I have the right focus. Zooming on photos was easy and second nature. Going back to S95, I quickly found myself trying to touch its screen.That said, I felt the RX100 did take better photos. Its a superb camera, but consider these:- Its bulky compared to the S110, and though it fits in my jeans pockets, it is not comfortable- The UI is difficult sometimes to navigate. My wife could not figure it out. I was able to figure it out and did enjoy it, but the wife did not like it at all.  Neither could a few friends - at least not easily.- The video was better on the RX100 (60p vs Canon's 24p)  but the Canon's video was very good also.- The battery life was better on the RX100 (my biggest gripe with the S110 is that I need to have a spare battery)- In a blind photo comparison on the laptop, 3 out of 4 family members picked the Canon's photos.  It is probably because of the image processing that the Canon does.  While I know that a true photographer would edit the RAW photos in Photoshop - that is not me. What the camera gives me is what I share.- The price - double the price of the S110, just didn't seem justified for a point-and-shoot person.  Perhaps for the photographers out there looking for a companion to their DSLR, but not for meI give it 4 stars because of the poor battery life and that 24p video is not enough", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great small camera", "Author": "maxmach", "ReviewID": "R1HU6R5QVOD040", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera delivers what canon intended, great pics in a small package.

I do have a Canon SLR crop camera (Rebel XSi witht the 580EXII speedlight and several lenses including some L lenses), which I love and have used for the past several years.I had a 7-day trip to Paris coming up and really didn't want to carry my SLR around.  I also didn't want to miss out on amazing pictures and memories of my first trip to the beatiful city.  I made the decision to go with the S line and originally came here to Amazon to buy the S100.  To my amazement, there was a note that the S110 was just a few days away from being released, and with the groans of the lens error that S100 owners complained about, I chose to try the upgrade.I've go to say that the S110 is pretty amazing. I took over 1800 pictures and 50+ HD movies and was blown away by what this camera can do.  Moreover, its low-light capability is truly amazing...I hardly ever used the flash whenever some light source was in my shot.  The manual settings are great for achieving specific shots.The build quality is great.  There is no viewfinder, but I'm more than happy with the large toughscreen.  Battery life is as expected although not as long as in my SLR (which is expected due to the smaller batter size).  The white body is beautiful and definitely draws attention in a sea of black cameras.  The camera is compact, but obviously no where near the size of those mini Canon elph's.I found the startup to be quite fast.  I was able to pull out this camera while on the move, take a couple of shots and put away the camera, all in a really short duration of time.Let's be clear though..this doesn't produce SLR quality pics, but for its size and convenience,it's a great option for those traveling light, or those that don't want to invest in a SLR right now.Hope this helps!", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT IMAGES & EXCELLENT SIZE", "Author": "Jonathon", "ReviewID": "R3LXQSU2VL57L6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my backup Canon camera.

That means a great amount of what I shoot is outdoor but when I do shoot inside I just can't stand a slow camera with shutter lag/delay.I had Canon's wonderful S95 (this model previously) and later I purchased Canon's dismal S100.  The S100 was a mistake in so many ways and I won't detail that here but the Canon S110 is now under my direction and I so love it!My needs come down to my travels and I don't like handing over my SLR's to strangers or to people that might drop it if I am asking for shots of myself/wife to be taken by another.  There are also certain times I just don't want to bring the SUV of cameras along for a day where it is essential for quality photography.Canon's S110 shoots near SLR like quality that is so good that I can pick out the individual blades of grass in a outdoor shot.  Or the stunning blue skies so detailed that the camera image is even better looking than that of the actual sky itself.It's fast.  Even inside.  I can get 100 shots out of it in just minutes.  It races to process the prior shot and stands ready for the next shot.This is a POINT & SHOOT camera so you do have limits.  Yes, there are tons of potential settings but for a Point & Shoot; leaving in the AUTO mode isn't a bad thing.Is it perfect? NO WAY.Canon fails on battery life with the S110.  Yet in fairness, most have asked for a small pocket camera that can mirror-image SLR quality.  Plus, at just $325 in price.  So you'll need an extra battery at all times.  Add to that the very slow recharge time it takes to recharge your Canon wafer-thin battery.Now let's go to Canon's infamous POP-UP FLASH.  It will push your thumb away from the body as it pops up so NEVER hold the camera without the strap to secure it.  This POP-UP flash has been complained about for years but Canon hasn't changed it and they must have their reasons why.  There's also no rubber grip on the cameras body front so again, have that strap always in use and around your hand so that you don't drop this camera.If you want detailed SPECS here, I'm not going to list them as you can see them online at so many places including AMAZON.COM.

There are just a few places where this camera falls short and I mention them in case they are important to you and not because I think the camera is deficient in any way.Obviously, you are not going to get great control or options with flash; you are stuck with the puny built-in flash which does a fine job for casual photos. It does give some control over how the flash triggers and is exposed if you want to tweak what you can with this size flash but results can be iffy. There are practically zero options for using off-camera flash.If you are looking to push creative limits you should know that the camera is limited to a 15 second exposure time. Some say the 15 sec exposure maximum is an arbitrary decision by Canon, some say they did it to avoid overheating the camera sensor and/or killing the battery.Also limiting creative choices, it can not go higher than f8, meaning the aperture can't get very small in order to limit the amount of light. This limits depth of field and taking longer exposures.One other thing that bugs me with cameras like this is that it is trying to be everything to everyone, ie appeal to point & shoot as well as expert audience. Ultimately, one gets in the way of the other. I wish I could make all the idiot options disappear. Is anyone outside of Japan really taking headshots of people so the camera will recognize and tag them in future photos? This is all taken care of in off-camera photo management now and seems really stupid. And all the crazy \"wink to take the picture\" and \"take a picture when detecting a new face\" options are useless to me. Maybe these will amuse you and you will find them useful. You can largely ignore these options but they still occupy space in the menus.I care not about video options but this camera can do full HD with image stabilization.So, those are some things to think about when choosing this over a DSLR. That said, it does offer some pretty amazing power and control for a compact camera. If you can live with the limitations then you won't be disappointed. There are lots of ways to customize various buttons and controls on the camera, adjusting to your needs and tastes.I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for an excellent mix of portability and picture control, as well as a causal shooter who thinks they might want to take advantage of greater control as they grow.

The 2.0 aperture on the wide end is pretty good, but it closes down really quickly if you zoom in.  It's fine for taking pictures of food in a dimly lit restaurant if you want a wide-angled view (which I usually use), but the quick progression to F4 or so once you zoom in can be a bit annoying.  The low light capabilities of this camera aren't bad, and shots taken at 1600 ISO are certainly usable, definitely if you want to share the pictures via the web.  They also clean up OK in tools like lightroom.  Overall, the image quality isn't nearly as good as DSLR, but it offers a lot in a small package.The touchscreen is surprisingly useful.  I use it primarily to scroll through pictures in the view mode and also to pick a focus point when shooting a picture.  Being able to zoom into an image using pinch-to-zoom and then scrolling around with a touchscreen is pretty nice.The physical knobs are good for choosing options, and they are configurable as well.

The white balance is completely off causing images to appear much \"cooler\" than they should and there was no way to correct this with white balance adjustment.  The photos that come out of the S95 were very vivid and crisp - those from the S110 were dull and the colors all seemed off.

Sony RX100 is the best in this category considering image quality and size.  Panasonic LX7 and many others are simply too big to be pants pocketable.  If it isn't pants pocketable, you have much better options in similar sized mirrorless cameras.  Nikon 1 and Olympus PM2 comes to mind.  Also, if it's too big, it can't be your always carry camera.  STILL, there is one issue with RX100.  RX100 is just too darn expensive.  It costs more than many of the entry mirrorless cameras.  It's fine if you are only getting RX100 for everything, but if you have multiple camera systems, like a DSLR and a Mirrorless system, then RX100 seems bit too much as you would probably want to use your \"portable\" mirrorless camera as well.  I don't want to spend more on a compact than my mirrorless camera or even a DSLR.  It will be for snap shots... for always carry type of thing.So, my only other option is Canon Powershot S series.  You can get S110 currently for $200.  S110 take great quality pictures for a compact camera.  I like the jpegs out of the camera and you are able to shoot raw as well.  The new touch screen on the camera is very useful.  Now, it doesn't have all the controls in buttons and dials.  Many of the features are in the menu or quick menus options.  I can live with that since I bought it for convenience for snaps with \"better\" image quality than my cell phone.  If you want a serious camera for photography that is portable, you really should get a mirrorless camera since compact cameras are compromise cameras.  LX7 has a great lens, but mirrorless camera has prime lenses that can easily beat it.  Sony RX100 has a great  sensor but even Nikon 1 with their prime lenses can beat it in my opinion as I own them together before.  (Nikon 1 with 18.5mm f/1.8 lens can get sharp images with decent bokeh compared with Sony RX100, and it has DSLR like af speed and incredible burst rate.)  Canon Powershot S110 is perfect carry everywhere truly pocketable camera.  There is nothing better in this size.  Again, there is nothing better in this SIZE.  Any bigger, just get a mirrorless as a jacket pocketable camera.  Sony Nex 3N and Olympus PM2 are very jacketpockable.  Nikon 1 J1, J2, J3, S1 of course is another option.  As for a \"compact\" camera, Canon Powershot S beats others in terms of price, convenience (no lens cap), size, features (touch screen), and has similar image quality as other \"advance compacts\".One more thing, the wifi on S110 is pretty useless.  You have to be on wireless network to share pictures with you phone or tablet wirelessly.  That kind of defeats the purpose if you are outdoors.  Also, no remote shutter or view finder capability as with Samsung cameras.  If you won't use the touch screen, S100 with GPS is probably better for you.  As for me, I like the touch focus feature on S110, so I went with S110 over other Powershot S series.  (Also S95 has 28mm wide versus 24mm on S100 or S110)  Well, here is it.  If you have other systems and want truly a carry everywhere camera, Canon Powershot S110 is as good as it gets.  If you are looking to get one compact as your only camera because you will never carry multiple lenses, LX7 or RX100 or other bigger advance compact may fit you better with more buttons and dials.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just great!", "Author": "Detroit4ever", "ReviewID": "R213W1ZP1XKG2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This S110 is a great camera to have.

I haven't had a Canon brand point-and-shoot since an Powershoot S10 failed me on numerous occasions, including on 911 and on a few job surveys.Due to overwhelming recommendations I chose this model S110 to supersede my third Samsung camera. This Canon has a touch screen and a sturdy body. The buttons are relatively easy for me and nothing has accidentally turned on by rubbing against things in my bag.Generally I'd say this is a very nice camera although a bit pricey above $300-I have no comment on the wireless function. The pictures are clear and the camera is fast. I like that!I am not going to comment on general specs that you can find out on your own. But rather a few personal experience issues that may or may not matter to you, especially since you're probably much smarter than I am:1. Why is there a zoom button on the lens and another zoom button on the shooter button? Why are there two buttons doing the same thing? The one on the lens looks kind of cool but is ergonomically lacking and not any better than the small one. On custom settings it does work for aperture and such, but I do that on my larger camera. Still getting used to this.2. I do have a big problem with the battery. To me its is far more important than the wireless stuff. These days so most peripherals plug in AND CHARGE via USB. This Canon has a separate battery charger like the P S10 from 1999, and you need to open the body and take out the battery, put it in a charging saddle and put that in the wall. Okay. And instead of it charging when plugged into USB, it drains if on the USB and is turned on. This is outdated by many years. Uploading the photos via USB should mean replenishing battery power. Seriously! Yes this is very annoying and cumbersome and I really don't need or want more chargers (junk) around the house or on my trips.3. My fingers keep accidentally pressing \"stuff\" on the touch screen.4. The flash pops up under an ergonomically natural finger position where I'm holding the camera. I turned it off altogether, since the camera is great in darker areas anyway.5. The finish of the body is slippery and have come close to dropping it a few times. I am not the type to drop things like this, and I never liked having a wrist chord on my cameras.Reading the reviews, I am concerned about a future lens failure, especially at critical moments. Because that is when they occur. I naively expected Canon to have repaired this issue from the S100 model, -which is why I didn't buy the S100. Buying a product from a reputable company should not be a roulette and I wouldn't mind some comments on that one.I am also a little annoyed that this camera feels (to me) a bit overloaded with gadgetry. A somehow simpler camera is more desirable, and a on/off button for the touch screen would be helpful. I wonder if the battery would last longer that way.But hey. It shoots great pictures for a P&S; and so far I have had good luck with the video, minus some focusing issues when on the move. Another reason why I chose it: 1920x1080-H.264! Tripod preferred and gives you great results.Generally the function buttons are fine to use and well thought out. The on/off button takes an effort -which prevents it from accidentally going on. Good thinking, Canon.Canon makes nice cameras and I have an old 10 Rebel and the HV30, both great and lasted a long time.*** Update 6-25-2013. Whoops! My daughters last day at school and the camera is dead and says to charge the battery. I foolishly left it plugged into the computer the day before uploading a lot of work photos.

Luckily there are cheap batteries you could buy here on Amazon and elsewhere, and they all charge super fast, so i'd recommend getting two or three more for image posterity. This camera has the coveted HDR feature, naturally though, the camera has to be very still for the series of images it takes, so i recommend a small tri-pod. It takes a couple seconds then to combine them, like any other camera on HDR function. Haven't had any lens issues, but if i do i'll certainly post here about it.. that was my only concern when buying this camera.

Asker", "ReviewID": "R23C4X9O0HHMA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an S90, the predecessor of this camera, and I love it. It's a wonderful machine. I'm sure the S100 and S110 only improve on it. However, if you are in the market for a highly capable, very compact camera, be aware that there are some other outstanding competitors today. I was looking for the very best digital camera that I could easily put in a pocket, when I bought my Canon. It was very tempting to bend that \"pocketable\" requirement for a little more capability in another parameter, but my approach was that if it wouldn't easily go in my pocket, I might as well use a DSLR and get the greater speed and flexibility of a bigger camera with interchangeable lenses. So, keeping that in mind: if I were looking to buy a truly \"pocketable\" high-end camera today, I'd also look at the Fuji XF-1 and especially the Sony DSC-RX100, but not cameras like the Canon G15, which is a wonderful \"compact\" and in significant ways \"better\" than the S110 but won't fit in a normal pants pocket. The thing that is intriguing about the RX100 is that the sensor is much larger than the one in the S110. (The RX100 is also considerably more expensive, however.) Sensor size is a much more important driver of quality and versatility than the number of pixels. My advice is pay attention to sensor size and the lens; ignore megapixels.

I was even able to capture a decent photo of Aurora Borealis. So here are some other highlights.I owned the S100 for a while but lost it while I was traveling so replaced it with this S110. The one major complaint I had with the S100 was that it had a very slow response time when using flash. So slow that when I would ask strangers to take a photo for me, I'd have to explain to them each time that they need to hold the shutter down for a while (on average 3~5 seconds). With the S110, however, it's significantly faster. It works like how it should (on average <1~2 seconds).It also takes better pictures under low light conditions (without flash). Even when capturing against the sun in the background, you can still clearly see the person's face (where normally it would be too dark).Wifi Capability - The wifi capability is SO useful. I don't even care that they took off the GPS geotag that they had in the S100 (because it didn't even work that well to begin with). The built in wifi doesn't mean it connects to a wifi hotspot. It BECOMES the wifi hotspot for your devices (phone, tablet, etc) to connect to. It allows you to use your phone's GPS to geotag each pictures taken by the camera. The best feature about this that I absolutely LOVE, is that it lets me transfer my camera photos directly onto my device through this wifi connection (very fast, too). This makes photo sharing SO much easier. For example, I can take a photo of a waterfall with my camera, then transfer it onto my phone, then upload it or email it to someone right ON THE SPOT, while I'm still standing in front of the waterfall (as long as I have phone reception).Underwater Housing compatibility - I have an underwater housing for the S100 (Canon WP-DC43). I did not want to purchase a new one for the S110 because they cost almost as much as a brand new S110 on Amazon. Great news is that the underwater housing for the S100 works just fine! The only thing is, the power on/off button does not align. All of the other buttons work fine. You can get around the power button issue by pressing the photo review button to turn on the camera and pressing the shutter button to take photos, and make sure to adjust the automatic shut off time (not to waste too much battery) to let it turn off on its own.I love this camera <3I think one complaint I might have though, is the power on/off button.

I will recommend buying a spare or 2.The body is rough so it does not slip out of your hands but I always wrap the lanyard on my hand just in case ;)I am happy with the purchase I am sure you will too, the image sensor is larger that the average P&S; on the market this also adds to better image quality.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "funny usability, great pictures", "Author": "who", "ReviewID": "RJ6REHGWDTQNB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like the earlier reviews described, there are multiple usability aspects that leave a bit to be desired.

So we are giving away the S110 to a family member and I ordered a S95 for my wife. If you need the bells and whistles, it takes pretty good pictures, but if you are mostly looking for image quality, the S95 is excellent.Update Nov. 25 - Thanks for the comments about making the comparison on pictures downloaded to the computer, not by comparing the LCD screen in max resolution. After redoing the comparison with downloaded pictures at 100%, the sharpness seems to be about the same, a bit less noise on the 110, but the colors were noticeably more accurate, brighter and more saturated and contrast was better on the 95.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the lay of the land.The S110 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 12.1 resolution (megapixels), and x5 zoom. Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is 1/1.7 inch CMOS-type. That is just a number, but one that matters. Most point and shoots have a 1/2.3 inch sensor, which is a couple of steps worse than the S110.It does not have a viewfinder, which many in its class don't. The ISO rating is 12,800 which makes it work better in low light. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control manually both the exposure and the focus. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 461,000 resolution touchscreen, and the burst rate- for fast action- is 2.1. This is not a camera for sports photography, but it will perform well in continuous mode. The camera also does RAW processing which would be useful if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. And all this with a light camera weighing only 198 grams.Overall, great camera.

I bought the S110 hoping it would be a good enough camera at its price point and save me the $300 price difference. I had it for a week and was generally pleased despite a few flaws, but the thought of the RX100 photo quality kept nagging at me. So I relented and ordered the RX100 and have made a thorough comparison conducting extensive side by side photo shoots. Though the S110 has some really nice features that make it tempting to keep, and also save the extra money, the RX100 photo quality exceeds it by such a large degree that I ended up sending the S110 back. The following is the summary of my comparison.The S110 is lightweight and easy to grasp. The button labels printed on the camera are larger and easier to read and the buttons themselves are larger than those on the RX100. It's menu system is intuitive and easy to use and is aided even more by the touch screen. The touch screen also enhances the photo-taking functions by activating a secondary function for the control ring when you place your thumb on the right hand edge of the screen. The wi-fi is a convenient time saver. However the app won't work on my Android tablet which was a big disappointment. Picture quality on the S110 is inconsistent. Auto mode produces photos that are overexposed, overly vivid, and the color tempurature far too much on the cool side. They are essentially unusable for me. You can get decent pictures in Program AE mode but you will need to play with settings to find what works best for you in given conditions. Even then you may be in for some post-processing work to get them \"dialed in\". Overall I feel my six year old Canon SD800IS produces equal or better results. HDR mode requires a tripod (or very steady hand) and does not always produce a good end results in-camera. Further post-processing is still needed. Battery life on the S110 is poor. It is made worse by the fact that the battery indicator gives little warning of battery death. It did leave me stranded with a dead battery once. You'll need spares with you at all times. The Canon software is very good and makes uploading easy and also provides excellent info on all the settings used in the photos.RX100 picture quality is phenomenally better than S110 in almost all cases. The only exception is in macro mode where the S110 is close (but the RX100 still better). The DRO and HDR functions on the RX100 are worth the price of admission by themselves by ensuring very good in-camera results. The low light capabilities of the Sony are incredible and in another league entirely than the Canon. The RX100 menu system is sometimes awkward, forcing you to push buttons or turn dials unnecessarily to scroll through options. It is also not as intuitive as the S110 so you sometimes have to use some trial and error to find the function you want. The screen is very bright after setting it to sunshine mode, and it has very nice resolution. It is noticeably better than the S110 screen. Due to its weight and large diameter lens the handing quality of the RX100 is not as sure footed as the Canon. Sony made an ergonomic blunder in putting the movie button beside the thumb rest which makes the thumb pad much smaller than it could have been, which I think would have greatly aided the handling quality. I prefer the smooth operation of the Sony function ring as opposed to the clunky detents of the Canon. The Sony software is good and has a couple of unique features but overall I preferred the Canon software.To conclude, the S110 is a very good integrated design package that has some cool features. Its battery life is a frustrating inconvenience. But its generally unremarkable photo quality and poor Auto mode seal its fate for me. The RX100 has stellar photo quality but is less refined in menu and handling than the Canon. The RX100 has a much better screen and battery life. Both have good software. The shortfalls of the RX100 versus S110 are minor. The S110 has the cool features of wi-fi and touch screen that are nice conveniences that one can ultimately live without. As an overall package for my needs and budget the RX100 wins even at the much higher price point.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lens & Flash failures", "Author": "Mamagiggles", "ReviewID": "R2S0PFRW8I6NVJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Great camera when it works.

For that reason, I am going to up the rating on this product.  It was previously 3 stars.  I now rate it 5 stars.  I do warn you, the software installation could be frustrating.  When I connect my camera wirelessly to my computer, iPhoto wants to open as a default.  I can close that, and then open ImageBrowser EX.  That will import the photos.Since the previous writing, I took an overseas trip, and found the 24 mm wide angle lens very good for photographing architecture and art inside cathedrals.  My primary interest in this camera was the wide angle lens and smaller size.I wish the wireless transfer to my Nexus 7 was faster, but it works.I have taken photos in the evening, and low light conditions seem to work well for me.========At the time of this writing (3/2/13), part of the software that comes with this camera (CameraWindow DC 8) does not work on an iMac (I'm running O/S 10.7.5).  The Cannon help desk told me this, after I had fooled with the setup for a couple hours, and finally called help.  They say an update is coming out.  If it does, I'll try to update this review.  What this means, is that some of the suave wireless features advertised by Cannon, don't work with the iMac.I should point out, the software does install.  But what will happen, when you try to connect, you'll get an error message that says Camera Not Found.  And this is true whether you're using the USB cable, or trying to connect wirelessly.I was able to setup the wireless to transfer files to my Nexus 7 tablet.  To do this, I had to download a Cannon app from the Google App store.  And then on the camera, the transfer is done when choosing the Android phone option.  This will only work if you are signed onto WiFi.I am also able to use the WiFi to transfer files to my desktop.  But its done through iPhoto.  The help desk said iPhoto couldn't do it, but it does work.So in essence, the Cannon S110 does what I want.  I'm able to transfer files onto my tablet when I'm in a WiFi zone.  And using WiFi, I'm able to transfer photos into iPhoto.But I'm not able to use CameraWindow DC 8, and then the Cannon iMage Gateway (web based).  And that's disappointing.I do not have a full review of the hardware yet.  But I wanted to get this note out, to let purchasers with iMac's be aware.I should add one more thing.  Because the camera comes with WiFi capability, I bought a regular SD card.  On my other camera, I have a Eye-Fi CD card.  That's basically a WiFi retrofit.  Setting up Eye-Fi can be finicky too.  But I think the file transfer speed on Eye-Fi might be faster than what I'm seeing with the Cannon.I'm hoping this camera turns out to be a good camera.  I have taken pictures with it, and they've come out well.  My primary interest in it is that it has some wide angle capability (24 mm).  I'm not an expert on cameras, but wanted something with more of a wide angle than my previous camera.If the software is fixed, and and the camera turns out well, I'll increase my present 3 star rating.

I am not a professional photographer, but I know several, and they all recommended this. My most frustrating experience is that most point-and-shoot cameras do not handle low-light situations. I am a night owl and typically take photos at night, in a bar, at a restaurant; so it was crucial to not get grainy, or over-exposed photos when using flash. Every \"low light\" setting on any point-and-shoots have been disappointing, as if turning on the flash and strobing it was going to help. Low aperture, mid-high ISO will get you a pretty beautiful dimly lit alley-way shot on a rainy night.Menu is intuitive. LCD touch screen is massive, so make sure to get a protective cover. Wireless setup is pretty flawless. The camera software is a bit slow, but preferable to others, I think. Transfer can be slow depending on your network configuration, obviously.Be SUPER careful about putting your finger on the flash bulb cause it pops up right where you want to stabilizing the camera while shooting.Portability wise it's a little bigger than the typical point-and-shoot, but I'm a functional kind of girl and much prefer beautiful photos than a candy-colored snapper in my purse.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutly best bang for buck point and shoot!", "Author": "Dammika J \"Dammika\"", "ReviewID": "R15CMLMDHWQU5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Sony RX100 II now which is what I replaced this with, I gave my old S110 to my aunt and bought a new one for my parents.Both parties equally technologically challenged, both parties now sending great quality pictures.this camera is my absolute fav worth every penny very highly recommended.!It's not as good as the Sony Rx100, but it's more pocket able, lighter and is much better value for money.

The image quality is very good and its great to have GPS tagging your photo locations (unless you don't travel or don't care about that).

While all of Nikon's new point & shoots are adding Wi-Fi on top of GPS or GPS on top of Wi-Fi, CANON choose to remove GPS; replacing it with Wi-fi.

I own DSLRs that include optional add-ons for wi-fi and/or GPS. I find the wi-fi option cute, but unnecessary today, but GPS to be extremely useful.

For me, loading the photos onto my laptop and not seeing where they were taken is sometimes disappointing.

The reviews for the camera were fairly positive, with the stickler being the possibility of getting the lemon lens.  One of the deciding factors for me when compared to others in this price range was that the batter/charger were the same as my old camera.  Well, I have been using the camera for several weeks now, and believe I have seen the good and the bad of this camera.Pros:Solid body.  Built to last.Generally great pictures.Auto focus works very well.Auto flash is very good.  Only comes on when needed.Good view screen with decent touch interface.Videos are good to.Cons:The flash is in the wrong spot.The picture snap response is slow (auto focus?).The processing speed is slow (buffer?).  Forget rapid shooting; you really have to wait a long time between pics.Unfortunately, I didn't hold this camera before I bought it.  When the flash comes on, inevitably my finger is in the way.  I don't see how you can hold this camera well without running into this.  Maybe it is designed to be used with only one hand, but I won't probably ever do that.  I have had others play with it too, and they say the same thing (without any prompting).The problem I had with my old camera was that it was too slow when I lined up a shot and pressed the button.  Sometimes it seemed like 2 or 3 seconds before it would snap the picture.  It also took a long time before you could snap another shot.  I thought some newer hardware would fix that, but I was wrong.  Different body, different software, same issues.I will keep the camera, but will definitely try the camera before buying next time.  Though the camera is generally very good, the cons really weigh on this one.

I took pictures side by side and it wasn't that impressed.  Not sure what the problem was then (condensation?  The box sat outside for hours before I brought it in and opened it) but it has gotten better.1) There are lots of improvements over my older Canons but this is definitely bulkier and bigger2) The wireless feature works great with my home wifi and my Android.  Took no time at all to setup either.3) Low light pictures do seem a lot more bright, as if there is a hidden flash, but are grainy.4) Camera is solid, feels great in your hand5) The \"ring\" isn't a smooth turning one, it \"clicks\" quite awkwardly between each setting, so you go clicking through options and not in a way you can run through them, one at a time, and not smooth at all, I find myself using the menu items instead.6) The touchscreen is awesome!7) Touchscreen picture taking is useless, you'd be taking pictures all the time, there is no way to hold the camera really without touching the screenIn the end, I was quite happy to get a new and fairly cheap camera, but it simply isn't THAT much better than my SD4000, except in low light, and then not super low light, just low light.I have since ordered and received the Sony RX100.  Which is why I waited to return this camera, wanted to compare them side by side.  After a couple of days of \"playing\" (yes I'm clearly not a professional, but I'd guess nor are most consumers), here are my thoughts:1) The picture quality of the RX100 is better, but not always, and not that much more, sure it has a lot more pixels, but over all, not a huge difference.  For just pictures, for ordinary consumer, I'd say get the S110, for being almost half the price, the pictures aren't THAT much different.2) The RX100's menus are awesome for those who aren't well versed in photography, it actually explains what each setting does and is for, even with a sample picture, and then within each has sub menus explaining what they do, with yet more pictures, and finally has a help button.  FANTASTIC!3) S110's wifi is great, RX100 has none.  Sending pictures to your phone and then posting or emailing them on the fly is really great.4) As great as the S110's low light \"brightness\" is, the RX100 is a good 10 times better on really low lights.  When there is enough light for you to see fairly clearly, they seem close, but when it's dark enough where you can't make out too clearly what you are looking at, and you can no longer see the colors, the RX100 can still take pictures that look like a cheap camera WITH a flash took (with a flash of course they both look great), where as the S110 takes pictures similar to what your eyes see when it's that dark.  The RX100 really shines with no flash in pretty darn dark settings.5) There are lots of other things the RX100 does, but might not be of interest to you, but they are there, like take pictures while recording video (but only in interlaced video, when I put it on p it doesn't let me take pictures), but those pictures aren't as great as doing so without video recording in room conditions.  The function ring is much better as well.6) S110's touchscreen awesomeness is missing7) You can still put an S110 in your back pocket, though it would be like a thick heavy wallet.  The RX100 however is almost a centimeter thicker and most of that is the lens sticking out further so I wouldn't call it a pocket camera.  The S110 feels better (grainy, square metal feel, but the Sony has a smooth more rounded metal finish) and looks better.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Apple compatibility", "Author": "sbenisch", "ReviewID": "R1A2GSIBS2NJ7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apple's Aperture recognizes the RAW format used by this camera.

Maybe I still need to figure out the settings but the focus target is so erratic a lot of shots just come out focused on something seemingly random. In that hurried moment, the picture is lost, something you may not even realize until you have time later to look them over. I just took it again on a trip hiking and while some did come out very well, about 1/4 of the shots got thrown away from bad focus or too blurry (even trying to balance on a rock).

Purchased this model mainly because of the WIFI and have been very disappointed with how hard it is to setup.  First off the package comes with a CD for install, out of our 3 computers in the house none have a CD player.  Canon's website is not user friendly and after 30 minutes of downloading various files we still can't get the wifi to work, won't connect to our home network, printer, laptop.  The download just included thier image browser program which is lacking when compared to Picasa.  I just want a simple camera that's intuitive, easy to use, and works. They should have one package bundle to download and take lessons from Apple.  The help files on the canon site are lacking in information or detail.  BTW- I'm a very technical person who runs an internet startup.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Viewfinder in This Nice Little Camera", "Author": "Spoilin' Grandma", "ReviewID": "RKHJMVNYDINM1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Technical Details (under \"See More Technical Details\", the expanded list) state that this camera has an electronic viewfinder.  IT DOES NOT!  I ordered this camera on December 4, 2013 and received it on December 10.  Before I ordered it, I contacted customer service to confirm that it did indeed have a viewfinder, as I had found conflicting information on various sites.  The rep stated with absolute certainty that it actually had a viewfinder.  It does not.  During three different communications with Amazon people, I was assured that the description would be changed so that others would not experience the same inconvenience that I did.  Now, 42 days after my purchase, they still have not changed the description.This looked like a great little camera--good reviews, convenient size, etc.  Unfortunately, because of the nearing holidays and the loss of time regarding this mixup, I was pressured into buying another Amazon camera (which was quite overpriced) and given more inaccurate information and assurances from Amazon rep's.  The bottom line is that I spent approximately $475 for another camera to get the viewfinder and still have not received the credit I was promised.  I was told to order it with expedited shipping, and I would be reimbursed for the special shipping.  Now they refuse to refund it.  I waited for more than a month to write this review, hoping I would be treated fairly, but Amazon has refused to honor their rep's commitments.  This is the greatly condensed version of this fiasco.  It has been a total disaster.'", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "clips.blur.on.and.off", "Author": "branda", "ReviewID": "RRQ65UN6Y9PP2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera is not what I expected to be for the money I paid.The flashing doesnt always work and it takes too long to snap a picture from one to the next..The worst part is that.the.camera.blurs.while.taking.a.clip..I.already.received.a.replacement.from.Amazon.but.the.replacement.is.just.the.same.faulty....", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Review_Canon powershot s110", "Author": "JUNG,SUNKYUNG", "ReviewID": "R3P2PWE7P3MJ6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Actually, i don't know how to use this and carmera.but it is useful and easy for me.it is very good", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Won't work with Windows 7", "Author": "Michael March", "ReviewID": "RABOS3TQLXU13", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got the camera, loaded the software, took some shots.
