{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I really like this camera", "Author": "Bob M", "ReviewID": "RJMJFFP44PJ9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the camera for a couple of weeks now but it seems like a great buy.  I don't profess to be a photography buff but picture quality seems excellent to me and I really like the 28mm wide-angle lens and 5x optical zoom and 10 megapixel resolution.  Battery life seems excellent and I like that it uses a rechargeable lithium ion battery.  Camera construction seems solid and I also like the LCD viewfinder/display.  Actually, I was a little concerned about the lack of an optical viewfinder but I guess it's a tradeoff for a larger LCD display.  I've taken some pictures outdoors in bright sun though and was able to see enough to know that I had the subject in view, so I guess I can live without an optical viewfinder.  The controls are laid out nicely and the menus and settings are generally intuitive.  One feature I like is the play button rather than having playback controlled by the mode dial.  from play you can either turn the camera off or just press the shutter to go back to shooting mode.  Hooking up the camera to my PC works fine under XP and Vista; no special drivers needed.  One minor complaint though is that Fuji uses a non standard cable (supplied) and that the rubber flap on the camera's USB port makes it a little clumsy connecting the cable.  Best feature for me though is the wide-angle lens.  Really comes in handy for pics to be posted online for rental property, etc.  Also purchased a 4Gb Transcend memory card and a Dolica NP-45 spare battery for about $12 each.  the 4Gb mem card is good for about 800 pics at 10M resolution and the battery got good reviews.", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just received today - so far, so good.", "Author": "Michael W. Lasota", "ReviewID": "REZO2NIFNVFM7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm going to write a follow up eventually but right off the bat, I have to say I love Fujifilm cameras.I had one from 2004-2006 that got stolen, replaced it and used it until I broke it. Eventually I tried an Olympus Stylus 710 and it was.. ALWAYS blurry, always fuzzy and just didn't react well in low light, or .. any light.The Fujifilm is a bit heavier than my Olympus and a touch heavier than the older model I had (can't remember the number) but, it's beautiful. Colours are vibrant and even with the flash off, and low light (I live in Oregon), the pictures come out clear and sharp. Not over processed, but natural looking.This is important to me. I also enjoy the speed of the memory. I purchased a 16GB Transcend Class 6 SDHC memory card and it writes quickly, and reads on my laptop (Dell Inspiron 1525) very fast. The images loaded quicker than off the XD card I used in the Olympus! (I thought XD was supposed to be faster?).I'm going to experiment around town tomorrow - live music venues (vital to me) and try to find sunshine shots. Hard to do in Portland this week.All in all, for an affordable point-n-click, I recommend so far.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "good camera", "Author": "Sandra Bryan \"Sandi\"", "ReviewID": "RGUV9E91GWS2Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A nice little camera that I can carry with me at all times. Have a lot of problems in sunshine taking a picutre. Guess I'm old fashioned and miss that view finder. But, if you just want to make sure you have a camera that you can easily carry anywhere, this is a good one.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "deepcloud", "ReviewID": "R2C7UUWAPA761W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to act as a small back-up to my Nikon D200.  I owned a Fujifilm Finepix F10 and that camera was great.  Excellent image quality and great low light ability.  It was on this experience that I bought the J250.  I was actually expecting better quality than my F10 since that camera came out in 2005 and cameras have progressed quite a bit.  I was wrong.  The image quality of the J250 flat out sucks.  The low light ability is among the worst I have seen.  Images at 400iso and above are pretty much unusable.  The camera is also not ergonomically designed.  The exposure comp adjustment, something any photographer should use is buried in a menu option and even though there is a setting called \"manual\" it not manual, with the exception of white balance.I returned the camera after one short evening trying it out.", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "It just takes pictures....", "Author": "momok", "ReviewID": "RTPDQU5PTWG0X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this one to replace another FinePix but I wish I didn't. The color in the photos ends up too white even when its set on chrome mode.

Earlier I had fallen on top of it on another trip and dented the case, but the little bugger kept on working nicely.  The screen, however,  was hard to see in sunlight and was small. The new Fuji has a huge screen,much more brilliant that the earlier model.  Very easy to use.  It also has a rechargeable battery that holds a charge for a huge number of shots.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "Geraldo Fonseca", "ReviewID": "R3AAKPBSCAZUSK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This review is based on my personal shooting habits - the ones of a lazy and unskilled photographer that expect the equipment to do the job for me. In more than 90% of the times I shoot in pre-defined or full auto settings.I bought this camera about an year ago, and it was an year old release by then. And just like another reviewer here, I previously owned a J10, which I liked a lot.Regarding its features, for the price tag I think the J250 is pretty much competitive with other vendor's offers.Expect the same shutter lag you are used to when using compact cameras, especially if you enable face recognition. For this price I don't think there are many alternatives.Battery life is not an issue, but don't go anywhere without a backup. The problem is that the battery gauge  keeps showing \"fully charged\" for a long time, but as soon as it drops one notch, you won't be able to shoot more than few photos before the battery is dead.But my main complaint with the J250 is its awful low light image quality. Unlike the older (and less featured) J10, this camera is basically useless in any situation other than a shiny day at Copacabana Beach.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect!", "Author": "Stephaniemob", "ReviewID": "RP6DEE1GKGR0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned a Fuji similar. So when I received this one, it's just as I expected. Fast delivery. Great camera. It's nice to not have to pull at a larger camera I have and I can still take quality pictures.

It has plenty of options and is still simple to use. The auto adjust for lighting is more intuitive than my other cameras like Sony and Panasonic. I was surprised to find that the video mode has zoom capabilities while filming - a major plus for me, and the camera's construction is classy but sturdy. The only downside to this camera is its thickness, but then you're getting 5X optical zoom, so it's understandable.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good low cost pocket camera", "Author": "J. Lee \"Kosmostoto\"", "ReviewID": "R1N8XSFKDG8Q9J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a good low cost little pocket 10Mp camera for $99. It is a simple snapshot camera without too many special function. The body is a little thicker than the newer model of this class. I like the big viewing screen, black metallic body and battery life. The wide angle is also a useful feature. Like all other cameras of this class, the small body isn't easy to handle and the snap button doesn't have a good touching feeling. It doesn't have 16:9 proportion option. That's the big thing I don't like. I can't use it to make Youtube HD (1280x720) video directly. However, for $99, I wouldn't mind have it in my backpack. Also, it is a discontinue model. You may not see too many of these still for sale on market.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice camera", "Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "R1S9KUKWJGMS33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera was received quickly, charged battery and started taking photos.

And right out of the box ease of use, but study the owners manual for a while for the best use of the included features, some of which are better than the competition.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Low quality LCD", "Author": "Justin Time", "ReviewID": "R30JSQ7M44DMKR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for the Fuji Finepix indoor quality which is known to be good even without a flash, and because we wanted 5x optical zoom and dual image stabilyser.Very dissapointed in the quality of the LCD!
