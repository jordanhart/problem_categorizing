{"Reviews": [{"Title": "As good as it gets...", "Author": "Matt Jachyra", "ReviewID": "R1JKIVODE4HK53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked around to pick a good digital camera. I had a few things in mind that I wanted but I could never find a right all together piece. I think that Sony was the best compromise in terms of features, size and durability. I shoot a lot of film and a lot of times I really don't have to, since the pictures don't go further than web. Using S85 saved me on processing cost, time and gave me more options as far as manipulation of the images go. Since my original purchase was to ease the load and free me up in my \"professional\" life I find that more often I happen to pack the digital on my hiking or camping trips. I still carry my film camera but I supplement my film shots with a lot of digital snaps. Using Sony manual modes also allows me to become better photographer and it's really fool proof. I see the results immediately and if something is wrong I can re-shoot it again which was impossible with film. I mean yes I can always shoot two or three frames but you surly never know until you get the film from the lab what came out. When I shoot concerts or band shots this is a one time deal. They can't go back and replay the gig. So to be perfect and on the dime is very important for me. I choose S85 for couple of reasons:1) Optics. Can't go wrong with Carl Zeiss glass. It's a really sharp and warm saturated tone that keeps me buying into Zeiss family.2) Lens brightness (f/stops). Maybe there are better cameras out there with higher zoom range but f/stops on this camera (S85) rock. It's bright and fast enough which means that in combination with faster film setting it will get the job done.3) Battery life. I originally was very skeptic of using rechargeable battery because of the possible what if I run out of juice scenario. I assumed that I will feel more secure with AAs that rechargeable proprietary battery. I was wrong. Sony battery lasts forever and with one spare everything is pretty much covered.4) Quality. Good enough for nice and crisp 8 by 10 shots. If I really push it I can get 11 by 14. But for my application it gets the job done.5) Controls. Easily accessible, options are always at the finger tips.6) Construction. It's a one big solid unit. No swivel lens, sliding doors, build in lens covers or pop up flashes. There is very few moving parts which makes it a durable piece. Plus build in charger keeps all your things organized.7) Flash and Sharpness control. At the finger tips I have full override on functions that were always problematic with digital cameras. This saves post production time required for touch ups.What could have Sony done to make it better? 1) ISO. Highest ISO setting is 400  I wish they went for 800.2) Accessories. There is a load of after market accessories for this camera by other manufactures than Sony. I would like to see some more lenses or maybe even external battery packs made by Sony itself. Underwater housing would be great.3) Little bit slow start up time. That needs some works.4) Memory stick. Great concept and I couldn't care less if I'm using memory sticks, flash cards or smart media cards but with 128 MB max Sony media is not the hottest choice out there. Sony S85 is a good camera, probably the best out of the bunch out there. I would highly recommend it to amateurs and semi pros alike. It's a good value for the money.", "Date": "October 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "Impresive quality for the price", "Author": "Miguel Garcia-Guzman \"Guzman, B MG\"", "ReviewID": "RZM0F3DEWL3KU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a 35mm film amateur photographer for many years. I have always used Nikon equipment and I value to control the camera myself for maximal creativity. I waited till now to try a digital camera, what I did two weeks ago buying the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S85 camera. These are my impressions when I compare it with classical 35 mm film and my reflex Nikon camera:1.- The DSC-S85 is small, but not small enough to fit easily in a pocket. Nevertheless is easy to carry and the retractable lenses make it quite compact when the power is off. The camera comes with a lens cover for protection. It is a high quiality point a shot with manual settings capabilities.2.- One of my concerns about digital photography is battery life. With the DSC-S85 this is not a problem at all. The battery will last a long time and unless you don\u2019t have the chance to recharge the battery during several days, it will not run out of power. The battery recharges quite fast when connected to electrical power.3.- The lenses and Carls Zeiss, and the quality shows. Impressive resolution across the whole picture, not only when you view the pictures in the computer screen but also in print.  I have done up to 5x7 inches prints and the quality is as good as film. Resolution is as good as the one obtained with my Nikon lenses.4.- It very easy to learn how to use the camera and very easy to control manually the shutter and aperture. In addition you have also aperture and shutter priority settings and full automatic setting. The easiest camera I have ever had.5.- The light meter is very good, and most of the exposures will come perfect unless you try to fool the camera with difficult light situations. The exposures are better than when I use my Nikon SLR.6.-Color balance is very good, saturated images but with real colors. Only very strong reds (i.e. a red rose) might fool a bit the camera and you might need to correct the image with software. Film here might be better and you can uses several film typoes, but one advantage of digital is that you have ISO 100-400 with no need to change the film.7.-The LCD screen is very good, bright (you can regulate the brightness, and provides a quite realistic view of the actual image. I use the LCD a lot, and really is a great way to compose pictures, better than using the view finder.8.-You can do MPG movies that are fine if all you want is to have a memory of a short moment (don\u2019t expect top quality here, after all this is an still camera). You can not do this with a film camera.9.- Although the Memory Sticks are not the cheapest memory in town they are reasonable after the recent price drop. With 128 MB you will be able to take >60 pictures at the top resolution. Film is not cheaper because you can reuse the Memory Stick for ever.10.- Very good macro. Nice pictures taken at short distances (<4 inches). My macro fotos with the SLR Nikon are better though.If you are a film photographer that wish to get very good quality in digital to have the opportunity of doing creative photos without caring about the price of film, I highly recommend this camera. You will enjoy it very much you will make more photos that before (without paying always for the film) and when the digital SLR cameras drop in price (2-3 years from now) you will be ready to move to a classical camera with digital power.", "Date": "October 27, 2001"}, {"Title": "An excellent camera for the non-expert (and up)", "Author": "Michael K. Smith", "ReviewID": "RVSWZBD9AQARA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've never owned a digital camera, nor am I anything but an extremely amateur photographer, but our first grandchild was coming, so I began doing a lot of research in consumer's magazines and at technical review websites. I narrowed the choice down to three cameras: The Sony S85, the Olympus C4000, and the Nikon CoolPix 4300, all of them 4 megapixels. After playing around with all three models, I finally went with the Sony S85 -- and I have not been disappointed. It's both simple enough for a camera novice like me to be able to take good pictures almost right out of the box, yet flexible enough (with the full manual control option, etc) to allow me to learn and to work up to a more advanced level. The controls are pretty intuitive -- for anyone with computer experience, anyway -- and the viewscreen is large and bright. It's also \"camera-shaped,\" not a radical new design, which feels more at home when I hold it, and it's large enough to allow my rather large hands to wrap around it. (The Canon Elph is a nice little camera, but for me it's like trying to type on a cell phone keypad.) After six months and some hundred of images, I can recommend this camera unreservedly.", "Date": "November 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "Zeiss lens & great CCD, but don't expect SLR performance", "Author": "Bob Carpenter", "ReviewID": "REVM9CABV8QI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amateur digital cameras make me long for the speed and accuracy of my Nikon N-90S professional SLR.  But an equivalent digital will set you back $5000 plus lenses, and increases the focal length of your lenses by 50% (and I love wide angle).The DSC-S85, which a friend of mine owns, retains the lens of DSC-70, which I own, increases the pixel resolution, and lays out the controls a bit more naturally.  Still, don't expect to hand this to your non-photographically-oriented friend and expect them to be able to control it -- the menus, etc. are just awful and very slow to navigate.  The real win for me for this camera is the Zeiss lens, which while not up to their professional lenses, is far better than what you get on other digitals.  This lens goes fairly wide (34mm equivalent for 35mm film), and has an excellent macro resolution.  It's also super fast at f2.0 at the widest to f2.8 at the longest;  phenomenal specs for a lens that costs $800, much less a whole camera.  A serious problem is that there's no way to get accurate focus -- the LCD just isn't sharp enough to selectively focus on just the foreground of food photos, for instance, even though at full telephoto on f2.8, you get a nice shallow depth of field.  At higher resolutions, the camera can only be described as slow both in time between the shutter press and the snap (it locks focus, so pre-locking by pushing shutter halfway will help), and between photos (especially at high res, it can take seconds to write the image from the camera's buffer to the memory stick).  It's also relatively slow to auto-focus.  The flash is weak, and so close to the lens that if anyone's looking at the camera, it's instant redeye.  On the other hand, the lens and CCD are so sensitive, you can nearly take photos in the dark anyway.  I do like the fact that you can fill flash, but wish you could turn down the fill level.  For anything but the most casual flash photography, you can hook up an external flash.MPEG films are cute, but short and poor quality (or longer, and even poorer quality).  If you want to shoot longer mpegs, you'll have to hook up the video out to a notebook and get the relevant software.  I wish they'd just get rid of this feature along with the sound and sound memo recording, and give me a slightly wider lens and more control over focusing (say zooming the display during viewing).  And you'll need a new memory stick or two (get the 128Mb ones, you won't regret it if you like to take photos).", "Date": "January 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great Camera! Almost like having a 35mm", "Author": "V. Pennington", "ReviewID": "R36EVBNQN3FFQE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I shopped around and looked at a lot of cameras before I decided on this one. I wanted a camera that could take pictures like a 35mm, yet have ease and use of a digital. This one fits the bill. On highest setting it records pictures at about 2mb. That means that if you buy a 64mb memory stick you get 32 pictures.(You can get lots more if you go to a lower megapixal setting, but why buy a high megapixal camera if you aren't going to use it to the max?) I have yet to go that far (I have transfered them to the computer and then started over). The battery last about 180 minutes using it with the LCD (which I recommend shutting off if you don't need it-especially outside). The only drawback at the present is that most photo printers cannot print at the capacity that my camera can take. I did have my pictures developed professionally online and was very pleased. The other drawback-and this is true for almost all digital cameras at this time, is that action photos are very difficult to capture due to low shutter speed. (not impossible, just very hard). This camera allows for adjustments of the aperature so you can take lower light pictures. I am very happy with the camera,and I recommend it for anyone who really wants to use this for taking vacation photos and such. Deleting and in camera cropping is easy and comes out great.

Miles", "ReviewID": "RLPPHCIZVTADE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shopping for a digital camera for about six months now, and I have been unable to make up my mind. I didn't want to spend a ton of money, so I was looking at several lower end 2.1 megapixel cameras. Well, I suppose my wife grew weary of my indecision, so she purchased the Sony DSC-S85 for me for Christmas. I was pleasantly surprised by the gift, and even more surprised by the quality of the camera. I have been a camera buff for several years, and have been wanting to dabble in digital photography. I can't imagine a better camera for under $1,000.00. Granted I have only had it for a week, and I am just beginning to discover the incredible potential of this camera, but the options seem almost limitless. It is amazingly easy to use, and offers a host of choices to make your experience as challenging as you would like. The 3x optical zoom is quite adequate, but it is enhanced by the digital zoom which still provides a high quality image. Here are the pros and cons as I have seen them:Pros:Easy to usePacked with features & all functions are easily accessed4.1 megapixels provide incredibly sharp images at highest resolutionSmall & sturdy constructionLong Battery life w/ fairly quick recharge (battery meter is very accurate)Bright LCD screenMPEG movie option (memory hog)Great value at just $800.00Cons:16mb Memory Stick is not enough to hold many high res images & additional Memory Sticks are expensive.Images in LCD screen often appear in focus, but really aren'tBright reds tend to cause a pink hue throughout image (but that could happen to a 35mm SLR)Slight delay when taking pictures, but canbe overcome with some practice.All things considered, I am very, very happy with this camera. As with any product it has it's negatives, but they are far outweighed by the positives. In addition to the camera, my wife also purchased the Memory Stick reader, that can remain attached to the PC via a USB port and functions like a zip drive. This is very helpful when it comes to downloading images, because you don't waste the camera battery life. She also purchased a 128mb Memory Stick. Yes, this is a very expensive accessory ($100 +), but it has been worth it. At it's highest resolution image it will hold 60 images, but if you are taking pictures to e-mail at 640 x 480 it will hold nearly 10 times as many. I also like the fact the Memory Stick can be used over and over again. If you are looking to take pictures and turn them into prints, then this a great camera. The color saturation is tremendous, and the image quality is outstanding. If all you wish to do is e-mail photos and post them to the web then you could get by with a much cheaper model. Even after only a week, I have no problem giving this camera my highest recommendation.", "Date": "January 3, 2002"}, {"Title": "An excellent entry to digital photography", "Author": "Christopher Terhune", "ReviewID": "R1AURDMI9EZIKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say that I was quite skeptical about digital photography when I received this camera as a wedding gift; I had read all the articles pointing out that film cameras produce higher quality photos, etc.  I was also quite certain that Sony could not possibly produce top quality lenses.I was wrong on both counts.  This is an excellent value for an entry level digital camera.  It takes excellent pictures in ideal lighting, and the convenience of digital imaging is such that you will never go back to standard film.  While the 16MB memory stick that comes with the camera is a joke, and you'll have to shell out for a 128MB or 64MB almost immediately if you want to enjoy the camera, all of the other accessories turned out better than I expected.  The battery life, for example, is excellent (and this is VERY important for digital cameras); I rarely have to even think about turning off my LCD since I can get about 2 hours life out of it.  A few gripes:  The camera has a very hard time dealing with bad lighting - it generally darkens everything, often to the point that everything is unviewable.  As a result of this, the camera generally does not show its strengths indoors - it takes outstanding outdoor, daylight pictures, but struggles mightily whenever the lighting is a bit challenging.  Also, the camera's auto-focus can leave something to be desired; it often takes poorly focussed shots if there are both foreground and background items on which to focus.That said, this is one of the best gifts I've ever received.  I use the camera constantly (much more than I used my old film camera), and I'm generally very happy with the quality of my pictures.

When I finally decided to get a digital camera, I poured over the detailed, technical reviews to gather as much info as I could on competing models. In comparison with other cameras, what sold me on the S85 was the image quality, color fidelity, and ease of use. Now that I've used the camera a lot, I could not be more pleased. For occasional 35mm work, I [previously] used a top \"Pro\" class camera and lenses, which will probably now be relegated to the closet for the most part. And believe me, I understand metering and focus, but I could not hit exposures and focus dead-on nearly as quickly or often as the S85.Pros: Nice, well balanced feel, unbelievably sharp lens, rich, accurate color without being \"clipped\" at the top end, excellent metering under diverse lighting conditions, snappy, accurate autofocus, and user friendly menus.Cons: None so far.

The Sony s85 will yield good, sharp prints up to 8x10\".  It may go larger, but I've never tried it.  As with any digital camera, you'll get better prints by taking them into Photoshop and setting the levels and color balance.  Right out of the camera, your photos will look quite a bit better if you use aperture prioity with the one-touch white balance.The Zeiss lens is good and sharp, fast, and has good bokeh (meaning that out of focus areas, like the background, are pleasing to look at).  I wish it would stop down farther than f8, but nothing's perfect.  The lens seems to perform well throughout its range of apertures and focal lengths.  It has a little distortion at the wide end, but I can usually live with it.Construction of the camera is very solid except for the little door on the side of the camera.  Mine's about to break off, but I don't care about stuff like that.  If you do, be careful not to drop it with the little door open, like I did.  The controls on the camera are very intuitive and easy to navigate.  I never have read the manual.The battery life on the s85 is amazing.  I almost always have the LCD on, yet I never have run out of power.There is one area in which this camera is seriously lacking: speed.  It takes a little too long for the camera to boot, and I've missed a few shots that way.  Mainly, though, the problem is the shutter lag.  If you really know how to use the camera, you can get around it by shooting wide shots in full manual mode.  That way it will fire the shutter reasonably quickly upon demand.  Still, if I know my subject's is potentially moving, I will put this camera down and grab another.It's also a little noisy in the blue channel at the higher ISO's.  That's normal for a consumer digital, though.  If you can, shoot with it set to 100.", "Date": "November 17, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Fotos & Options, Poor Focus & Macro", "Author": "J. Mock", "ReviewID": "R1Z2B6W5W8RMDF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I needed to upgrade after 4 years with a Sony FD-85 Digital camera. I needed higher resolution and higher memory capabilities. This camera met those needs, plus has some other pretty good capabilities, like shutter priority, aperture priority, good battery life, well thought out layout for all the controls, fairly simple menus, spot metering, and more. Also a pretty good price for everything you get, particularly 4 megapixels.What makes me wish I had bought a different camera is the focus system.Auto focus is really hard to see, and obtain for other than distance shots. Anything within 3 feet, the auto focus fluctuates and takes enough time focusing that by the time you think it's in focus and take the shot, it has sometimes refocused out of focus. It's timing and a guessing game. A larger LCD screen would make the focus more visible and help. The manual focus is in increments by scrolling, rather than manually focusing the lens. In macro mode manual focus does not work, which is exactly when it is needed the most. Moving the camera to the correct distance for focus in macro mode doesn't work well. Better to pick a distance, let the camera auto focus, then try to move closer and again wait for it to focus.\"Macro\" does not mean \"Micro\", but close-up it isn't.The FD-85 4 year old technology far surpasses this camera on auto and manual focus. Focus function, speed, and accuracy. With a Sony close-up adaptor accessory lens, the old camera was far superior at close-up work. Such an attachment with this camera would be of help (not available), but I question as to it's value due to the focusing problems.For great pictures on vacation, to replace a 35mm instamatic, and/or to have control over the camera's shutter and aperture when needed, this is a very good camera. 4 megapixels is absolutely great.For anyone who shoots pictures closer than 3 feet and wants a camera that can do real Macro, I can't recommend this one. If focus was more reliable, quicker, truly manual, and manual in Macro mode, I'd recommend it. For me, I'm pretty close to selling it.Lastly, Sony typically equips it's products with the bare minimum in batteries, memory, and other replaceable items. They did much better with the battery on this one, it's not necessary to have to buy one to get it to last more than 30 minutes.

There was one photo we tried to take of Christmas dinner where we had the dinner table and plates in the foreground and all the family members in the background.

The quality of the photos continues to amaze me.  I've taken shots in complete darkness, only relying on the AF illuminator to view my subjects, the flash makes the photo look like it was taken in daylight.  The size of the LCD makes reviewing photos easy for older relatives, they don't have to squint like some of the other P series Cybershots.The memory stick that comes with it, a 16 mb is not enough if you plan on taking good resolution photos.  Invest in a 128 mb, you can usually find them for under $50.  The battery life is solid, I always take shots with the LCD on, and I still get enough life to take 300 shots before needing a charge.My father-in-law is using a Nikon Coolpix 885, and is going to get rid of it to buy a DSC-S85.  The Nikon has horrible indoor quality, the flash is weak, and it has a pinkish red hue to most shots.

Circuit City has been the best retailer for my needs, their staff is always friendly and they don't jam that extended warranty down your throat like Best Buy does.I was tempted to look into the new DSC-V1, but I don't really think 5 megapixel is necessary for anyone who prints 8 x 10's as the largest size.

When you compare the inconvenience, financial and environmental cost of having a camera that you have to constantly buy new batteries for at a few bucks or more a pop to use, compared to a camera like this, which you only have to buy one battery for at about $50 one time every five or so years and it only has to be plugged in for a while to use it ... well I think it should be quite clear that a Sony Cybershot digital still camera is the way to go -- for beginners, and maybe even professionals.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Sony DSCS85 an older camera with many good qualities", "Author": "Lawrence \"duncan\"", "ReviewID": "R9OSW1CKXHE3B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For those of us who are technically challenged, this camera is a good start.

Between work and personal use, this is probably my 6th or 7th digital camera, albeit mostly for casual use.  I used everything from Sony & Olympus, to Canon, Nikon, and Leica.  I have to say that I love this camera.  First of all, I think that 4 Megapixels is plenty of resolution for most non-pro users.  Some people complain that this camera doesn't have as many \"manual\" features as, for example, comparable Nikon Coolpix cameras (which I also have: great pics too, but, much more difficult to use).  Its true it doesn't have every manual setting imaginable.  But I believe that 90% of the users will utilize at most 10% of those advanced features regularly.  And with this camera, all of the functions are very intuitive and easy to use.  Its pretty well thought out.Besides, a) advanced users know exactly what they are looking for in a camera, and b) good photographers can take nics pics with just about anything.  I believe this camera really appeals to those who value simplicity, want a bit of flexibility, and are unwilling to sacrifice quality.Its got plenty of features, enough manual settings for most, video & voice capability (you can take as long of a mpeg as you have memory, which is uncommon), external flash shoe.  Adapters for Telephoto & wide angle are available if you really want it, but, I've found that the 3x optical & additional 2x digital zoom usually suffice.  I think the bottom line, though, is that it takes gorgeous pictures with little or no effort.  This is a camera that anyone can use, and use well.  You can't go wrong with the Zeiss optics, which are exceptional.  I've been particularly impressed by the quality of pics under poor/difficult light conditions, which typically wreak havoc on digital cameras.  The battery life is better than most.  And, the fit & finish of the camera body is comparable, or superior to anything out there.On the down side.  I agree that the memory stick is not the most desirable of media types.  I'd love to be able to use a microdrive on this thing.  But, memory is [low cost] these days, and I generally carry a couple of sticks when I expect heavy use.

AND - which is VEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRY important - when shootin I wanto have the BEST Qlity, since all eVRY shot matters, when made.The real efficacy of the shots? - 'bout 10% or may-B less, honestly.DSC-S85, with 128MB MemStick, and with MSAC-US1 (USB-reader) aR my solution: I can shoot as a devil, havin options delete anytime a snap I dont like. When the card is full, I still can go over with friends and select on the DspLY the shoots worth keepin, and after the selection I can use my 128MB MemStick - or instert another MemStick and GO. Anytime the phots are displayed from a PWRPoint presentation or re-fabricated as old-fashioned paper-photos - they R just PRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFCT!Love this CyberShot DSC-S85, think it is my FAV for nxt yrs.It's a P.S. Dec-13, 2005: DSC-S85 is still my one and only camera. I've broken it in the woods some 3 years ago, while falling from the rocks, anyhow since I'm greedy I've not got it repaired, and it stil works. The only thing I can say: it's still no NEW generation of photocameras, that would make me think switching. In spite of a fact that thousands of cameras have debouched, S85 still is sufficient. And my recomm is: \"don't ask for the best on the market, ask for what you need; everytime somebody comes up with a new offer, ask youself: do I need it?\" If you would have seen me falling from the rock with my S85, you wouldn't believe it's in it's best nowadays :-)", "Date": "August 14, 2001"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00005LWLW"}}
