I haven't had a chance to really try out the other lenses yet but the camera is great.  The digital veiwfinder is not good at night as the other reviewers have stated.  I'll keep my other camera for that.  I love how this is lightweight, still in my price range and 'newer' than my other camera which is 4 years old.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "This was a great buy!", "Author": "Mr. Randall E.

Still experimenting with it, to learn all the ins and outs.  I wanted it  for closeups of art and jewelry; my husband wanted it for action shots of our grandchildren at play.  So far we are both happy.  The package deal was nice, although the camera bag wasn't great, but we feel the package was worth the price.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$759.29", "Features": "2nd Generation Translucent Mirror Technology camera\n24.3 MP for superb detail and amazing enlargements\nUltra-fast up to 10 fps continuous shooting with Auto Focus\nWorld's first OLED viewfinder; big and bright\nWorld's first HD Movie mode with AVCHD 60p/60i/24p", "Name": "Sony Alpha SLT-A65 DSLR Digital Camera with 18-55mm Lens Package 3", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gQ1FJ3xZL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009BPZ6RC"}}
