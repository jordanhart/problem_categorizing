I'm using it with the Lumix zoom 100-300mm lens and a Dolica monopod.  This combination is superb; I was hiking in a regional park yesterday, taking many full-zoom images (at 600mm in 35mm equivalent); I'm shooting with JPG+RAW setting, so if any image isn't good enough in JPG, I can edit the RAW image to improve it, but that was rarely necessary!  The camera+lens are a joy to use, and the images are superb...Sadly, I've been much less satisfied with the low-profile 14-42mm lens that this camera comes with; I wish I'd gotten the older, larger lens.  This one has a tendency to generate images that are generally fuzzy and indistinct, even in direct sunlight.  I have upgraded the firmware to V1.2, and have experimented with various settings to improve the image, with no consistent benefit.  To make my impressions quite clear, images shot with this lens are FAR inferior to what I got with my previous Lumix FZ47 on wide-angle settings!!  If I could rate this lens separate from the camera, I would give it 2 stars.So *definitely* consider the G5, which is an amazing camera, but pass on this poor lens.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC-G5XK 16 MP Camera", "Author": "Donna H.", "ReviewID": "R1ZV0VHG2Q4MLP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It takes wonderful pictures!

But I received the camera with the 14-42 Zoom Lens, that is much older and lower quality. I contacted with the seller and I have to say that they answered me really quick, offering a partial refund, because it was really difficult for me to return the item.
