{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Poor substitute for the real item", "Author": "Robert G.", "ReviewID": "R1VXYZFA3AB1FH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was hoping that this would be a good replacement option for the much more expensive OEM unit.  Unfortunately, I can not report that.  Yes, there are features lacking on this that I knew were in the OEM unit, but I was hoping that the unit would be good enough to use for the extra battery capacity and vertical shooting comfort.What I received was something that looked close to the OEM unit, which I was pleased about, but it is built on the extreme cheap.  The battery tray that holds the two batteries did not have a good fit with the batteries.  In fact, one feels as if they are \"wedging\" the batteries into the holder instead of making a positive connection.  The cover on the end of the battery compartment is flimsy, easily can pop open, and thereby expose the battery holder to the elements.  The fit of the battery holder inside is also problematic, with the holder not going in smoothly, and seeming to not always want to insert properly.The unit did not communicate with my camera properly either.  Not only did the camera initially not detect the two batteries in the unit, showing status only for one, but when I finally did get the camera to recognize there may be more than one battery on board, again, only one showed up.  Normally with the vertical grips the back panel display shows two batteries with the current battery highlighted, the second battery greyed out, but showing, and as the battery runs down, it automatically switches, showing the status for the other battery.  In this case, no greyed out battery #2 at all... no nothing for a second battery showing up at all.Granted, I didn't expect the unit to be as weather sealed as the OEM product, but one would expect a little better construction.  The buttons on this are definitely not weather sealed in the slightest.  I knew it didn't have the joystick button, nor several of the other controls on the OEM unit, so it is not fair to compare those items as they were obviously not part of the equipment design.All in all, I have to report that this is a very, very, very poor substitute for the original.  I wrote to get this one returned within the same afternoon as it's arrival.  I am still awaiting to hear back from New Harbor to return this unit and obtain a full refund.  I have already purchased the OEM replacement, something I should have just done to begin with I guess.  Tried to save some money, but this is definitely a piece of gear that is not worth it.  Stick with the actual, real Sony brand vertical grip.  The OEM product is more expensive, but definitely worth the cost in this case.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Can't beat it for the price", "Author": "None of", "ReviewID": "R1N9J9BMUAV9RZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony brand battery grip looks better with similar functions for 10x the price.
