{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HQ User Friendly Camera", "Author": "Richard C. Byrd", "ReviewID": "R3TYG54RGHUNNI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very User friendly camera for beginners. Purchased for $199. It is a 16mp camera with 1080p video. It has a good sensor and lens, so it produces high quality images. The lens and sensor matter more than the megapixel count. I have an old KODAK easyshare C653  6.1mp camera that takes better pictures than a Samsung PL120 14.2mp for that reason. For video, I prefer using the 720p setting so the battery lasts longer, and it is still very good quality. It has Wi-Fi, so you can transfer your videos and pictures to your pc that way, or directly to Facebook if you have an internet connection. I prefer to just put the memory card in the pc myself and copy & paste to the destination I want. The default auto settings seem to work very well, but there are other settings and features once you get more familiar with the camera.It has the usual delay mode for setting the camera down to tae group pictures with the photographer. The timer can be custom set up to a 30 second delay if you want, and up to 10 pictures can be taken before setting it again. Or you can use a feature that when it detects a smile, or wink, it will take a picture.There is less than 1 second delay after taking a picture until the still image is off the screen and you can tae another picture.The 12x optical zoom works great and can make high quality 8x10 photos. The 24x digital zoom is good too and works good with 5x7, but I haven't tried it for 8x10 yet. The 48x digital zoom is ok, but does lose some quality.Video: It can use the 12x optical zoom for video, and unlike some other cameras, with the Canon Powershot ELPH 340 HS, you CAN zoom in and out while recording video. The microphone is located in the front of the camera too, so your fingers don't cover it.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Convenient Feature Camera while on the Go", "Author": "Gi Fine", "ReviewID": "R37WT73TLZQJ8M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this to use at times I didn't/couldn't lug around my T3i with me; also, it's replacing my SD1400is (2010). So far I am pleased with the quality and abundance of features that are packed into this camera!Pros:Nice image qualityFast focusWi-Fi/NFC capabilitiesSmooth/great quality HD filmingCons:The body is pretty light, I like/am used to heavier frames. I miss the cold aluminum sturdiness of the SD1400is.It doesn't come with a usb cord - I'm sure by now you may have an extra mini usb cord (top hat) laying around but it would've been nice.LCD can be a bit grainy at times.Canon went with the new Digic 4+ processor  for the ELPH 340 - think of it as a happy medium between Digic 4 and 5 but optimized. I haven't had any issues with speed or lag. The camera responds promptly every time. As far as battery life, I will report back after a day of shooting images. Either way I still would recommend you purchase a back up battery just in case.The initial set up was quick and painless. I would love if they added the ability to include copyright info within the camera but this can be done in Photoshop in a click - it would still be nice to have. The Wi-Fi was surprisingly responsive and I ran into no trouble with setting it up with my router, phone or PC. This camera also has NFC for even easier connections.In my test videos, I was impressed with the image stability the most - this would make a great vlogging companion. The screen has a small amount of grain during playback but remember this is for review. Once imported into my computer the HD video looked great.*IMPORTANT*You must try out the Canon CW app in tandem with the camera. This app has remote shutter, the ability to share/browse pictures, remote shut off, and more! Even if you don't plan on using it, give it a try. I used it with the Android app. Though there is a slight delay, but it isn't off putting.All in all I am happy with my purchase and plan to use this for a long time. I will upload pictures into the customer photo section as soon as I can!*Update*I have added a couple images to the customer section. I am having a great time working with this camera.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love, love, love my new camera!", "Author": "Jonno", "ReviewID": "R306AJ3XL25I5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had purchased a Canon PowerShot a number of years ago and was looking to upgrade. I only had one minor issue with that camera's zoom, so I wanted to  stick with the Canon brand. I wasn't sure at first about buying a camera that hadn't been released yet, but I liked what I saw based on the specs. I wanted a compact point and shoot camera with more optical zoom than my original camera, as well as video and wi-fi. I was also hesitant on paying $199.99, but I was willing to pay a bit more for the features.I had read some reviews out there stating that this camera has \"too much noise\", but I honestly don't even notice. The pictures are beautiful and the optical zoom is great.The wi-fi was fairly easy to set up and the NFC with my smartphone is a plus, but it does drain the battery if you're using that feature alot on one charge. The camera does have eco-mode which turns off your screen after a shot to help to save your battery - a simple push of any button on the camera will turn the screen back on right away so that you can take your next picture. I purchased a back up battery just in case I need it.The camera is light weight (not as heavy duty as my original Canon point and shoot), but it seems durable. I plan on adding a screen protector to the screen to prevent scratches. I've been using this camera for about a week now and am impressed. I plan on using it on my upcoming vacation to capture shots that would otherwise be grainy / dark with my smartphone.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Impressive so far", "Author": "Joshua Kuntz", "ReviewID": "R3BEM27VK85DPG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received this camera yesterday, but so far I like what I see. I am a single father and bought this camera to take on spring break with my son. It is replacing a $99 Canon point & shoot that I bought two years ago when the battery died on my phone while on vacation. This camera is better in every way. It is smaller, lighter (yet somehow more solid), 3 times the zoom, and better stats. I took a dozen or so shots messing around after getting the battery charged. I know there are much better cameras out there, but I felt like this camera performed more than acceptably for how I will use it. It turns on quickly, has very little lag between pictures, and seems to focus and adjust very well in auto mode.I do want to talk about the wireless features too. I installed the CameraWindow app on my Android phone right away. Connecting to the camera's built in hotspot was very easy. I was also able to connect through my home router without any trouble. The controls on this app are pretty basic, but it seems to have all the bases covered. I think the remote shooting mode will really come in handy on our trip. I have a small portable tripod, and between the two, I think I will be able to capture many more memories than the last family vacation. Also, there is something cool about the \"long distance selfie\" :) I probably will not go through to trouble of signing up for Canon's online service because it doesn't seem that useful to me. I feel I can already do all the things it does once the pictures are on my phone or computer.There are only two drawbacks I can see to this camera so far. First, this is right at the top of what I would spend on point & shoot camera. I don't have any buyer's remorse, but I definitely thought long and hard about spending that much money for a camera. I also realize I didn't do myself any favors in that department by buying the camera on day one of it's release, but the timing was perfect. Last, I wish that this camera had a touch screen and a better menu system. I realize that it is so small a touch screen might be more trouble than it is worth, but the menus and buttons are the same on this camera as they have been on Canon cameras for probably 15 years. I guess a little \"if it's not broke, don't fix it\" may apply, but it give the camera a less than premium feel at a premium price point.UPDATE: I took this camera on spring break with me and I am very happy with how it worked. The wireless feature is very useful, but there is room for improvement. First, there is no multi-select in the Camera Window app. I was moving pics to my phone, and it would have been nice to check them off and move them all together instead of moving them one by one. I supppose this is a way to try and force you into the Canon Web service, but I have decided not to go down that road. My phone already does all of the stuff that service does, so I see no need for it. Second, the remote shooting is a very nice feature, but it takes a long time to get it setup. Even with NFC, you still have to connect your phone to the camera via WiFi. I guess if you carried a hot spot around, maybe you could leave both devices to that, but that seems a bit convoluted and probably wouldn't improve the experience much. If you decide to use remoting shooting, be prepared to spend a lot of time switching between it and normal mode. Once you are connected, it is very nice to be able to see the picture you are going to take while standing in the frame before you snap the shutter.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "Duke", "ReviewID": "R3UDHXOZDZID1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very familiar with Canon point-and-shoot cameras, and when I dropped my previous model and it stopped working, there was no question that I would buy Canon again. I went to [...]  and did a little research first; I suggest you do the same. This camera fit all my specifications. I use this camera mostly to shoot society events, so most of my photography is people in black tuxedos standing in dimly lit rooms; I needed a breast-pocket size camera that could perform in low-light situations. This camera really shines in those situations. It has all the bells and whistles you will ever need, has a nice display screen, the functions are intuitive, the size is perfect (always use the lanyard around your wrist; I learned the hard way) and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great little camera", "Author": "AuntieBroom", "ReviewID": "RTL2IM2FYP7K2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not wanting to lug my bigger point and shoot Canon, I bought this camera to take on vacation.

What surprised me was that it would not communicate with the tablet I own.  Maybe it's my fault for not looking under every rock & in every crack to discover exactly what tablets will communicate with this camera, but I thought any would and now I don't have use of that function.  That was the main reason that I bought this camera- to control it remotely.  Oh well, let my loss be your gain.  Be sure you own a tablet that will communicate with this camera.  Also, when I found a friend who had a tablet that would talk to my camera, it would not (it does not) communicate for movies, only pictures.  I had no idea.  I felt a little taken, because this kind of thing should be easier to learn about before you buy.  I shouldn't have to dig and study to learn the details just so I don't make a wrong purchase.  The write-up should just be up front about the particulars.  Also, to use the camera down-load feature on line, you must start an account, yes, another account, another password.  That might not be such a big deal in this day and age, so I tried.  But the account would not recognize me.  It said I input wrong info as I signed in.  I actually thought I did, so I said to send me a temp password so I could get in and fix things, but the temp password wouldn't work either.  I tried almost 20 times.  So much for that feature.  Something wasn't right in the app/program.  Very frustrating.  It did download to my computer through my wifi, but it takes a lot longer than pulling the SD card and letting it fly through direct.
