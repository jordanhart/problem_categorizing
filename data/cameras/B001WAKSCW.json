It is a freshly designed stills camera that gives DSLR performance with P+S ease and DSLR abilities.  As a video camera it is the best implemented video system on a \"stills\" camera today.This is an amazing camera but before I tell you why I would like to make a comment on the current situation of this camera.  First it is disappointing that Panasonic has region coded the camera and that they are starving the US market.  Check out the price difference between the US and Japan at Amazon JP.  However, you cannot change the language from Japanese to English due to the region coding.  Also, punish the companies that are overcharging (Big VALUE Inc. is/was charging a 1.67 price premium).  I for one will never ever do business with a company that does that.  If everyone boycotted these predator type companies, they would go out of business.When people first look at the GH1 there is an initial sticker shock.  Why would I pay so much more than the G1?  The major reason the difference is warranted is because it has a far more expensive lens.  The price difference of the 14-140mm lens and the 14-45mm that comes with the G1 accounts for 5/7 of the price difference of the cameras.  On top of that the 14-140mm lens is specially designed for video as it has utterly silent focusing and aperture changes.  Also, the aperture changes are step-less.  This allows for very smooth lighting transitions.  The remainder of the price difference can be attributed to the inclusion of the best seen-to-date video implementation in a \"stills\" camera and an upgraded sensor from the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 12.1MP Digital Camera with Lumix G Vario 14-45 mm f/3.5-5.6 ASPH Mega OIS Lens (Blue).  If you are not planning on working with movies then the GH1 is probably overkill and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 12.1MP Digital Camera with Lumix G Vario 14-45 mm f/3.5-5.6 ASPH Mega OIS Lens (Red) would be your best bet.  Also, the GH1 functions very much like the G1 for stills so any of those reviews will apply to the GH1.STILLSPanasonic markets this camera as like a DSLR only SMLR.  I think that is a cool bit of marketing and is right on the mark.  This camera has the best contrast detection autofocus on the market.  It is as fast if not faster than my Nikon D40 and is almost as fast as my D700.  This is a great technological breakthrough and is what allows the camera to be smaller than a DSLR while giving nearly identical performance.  With this camera you will not miss photos of your children or other fast moving subjects while you wait for your camera to focus.  Bravo.What is also nice about a great contrast detection autofocus is that Panasonic was able to start with a fresh design from the ground up.  The live view is the best implementation that I have seen to date.  I never use live view on my D700, but I will always be using it with the GH1.  It flips out and rotates 270 degrees.  This means you can see it from the back, the front (for self portraits), the top, the bottom, and on one side.  In addition, to the great screen articulation, the speedy contrast focus is the last piece that makes this live view great rather than painfully slow like it is on other DSLRs.On top of the great live view, this fresh design allows this camera to handle exceedingly well.  In many ways it takes the best of the point-and-shoot (P+S) world and mixes it with the best of the DSLR world.  It doesn't have as many dedicated buttons as my D700 but the Q Menu system works very well and allows for quick changes of most shooting parameters.  There is a detailed menu system but I don't find myself using it very much while shooting.  I feel that this setup allows photographers moving up from the P+S world to feel immediately comfortable on this camera while also giving experienced photographers the control they need to work their craft.I don't know what kind of plastic Panasonic uses on this camera but I love the way it looks and feels.  Also, I think having a red or gold camera is cool and makes it look more like a toy rather than a \"professional\" camera.  With the photographer unfriendly laws proliferating the world, it is nice to have an incredibly capable camera that doesn't look like a professional camera.This is a micro-4/3s camera system.  That has some pros and cons.  The chip is smaller than most DSLR chips.  A full frame (FX in Nikon speak) sensor is ~860 sq mm, a Nikon DX sensor is ~370 sq mm, the 4/3 sensor is ~225 sq mm, and the typical sensor used in a point and shoot range between ~25-50 sq mm.  However, a 2/3 sensor like many TV shows are shot with is ~60 sq mm and a 1/4 sensor like most home video recorders is only ~10 sq mm.  What does all of these numbers mean?  From a \"stills\" perspective the 4/3 format is relatively small when compared to DSLRs.  That means that for the same megapixel rating, the 4/3 sensor will have smaller photoreceptors and that means more noise.  However, the 4/3 sensor is roughly 60% of a DX chip so while this is a great physics discussion, in real life you will not be able to tell the noise difference based on sensor size even with a picture blown up to 100%.  This is born out by the GH1's excellent noise control up to ISO800.  You can also still use shots taken at ISO 1600 and 3200 but those low light shots are usually better turned into black and whites for that noire grainy look.  That is the \"downside\" (not really much of a downside especially when compared to the up side) of the micro 4/3 system.  The upside is that because you have a smaller area to cover, you can make lenses smaller (less weight and less cost).  You also get a 2x multiplication factor on your lenses.  So now that 200mm lens gives you 400mm of reach.  Yea.  However, on the wide side of lenses you need a 7mm lens to get a 14mm viewing angle and those can get pretty expensive.  The point of all of this mumbo jumbo is that this camera takes great pictures and the lenses are smaller than DSLR lenses.  Less weight and smaller size with no noticeable image quality compromise equals great camera.One thing that some people list as a negative on this camera is that in low-light the electronic view finder(EVF) gets dark, grainy and jerky (slow refresh speed).  However, I look at it as a positive because that is how your picture is going to look.  Unlike a DSLR which shows your eyes what the world looks like through the lens, the EVF shows your eyes what the sensor sees through the lens; an important distinction.  So if you look through the EVF and see a dark (low light), grainy (High ISO), and jerky (slow shutter speed) image then you know you better shoot really carefully, move the subjects to more light, or light the photo with the built in flash (not recommended but if its all you've got..) or use an external flash.On thing that is a negative is the slow 1/160 flash sync speed.  This will be very limiting for off camera flash during bright light.  With such a slow sync it will be exceedingly difficult (impossible?) to get shallow depth of fields while lighting.  Most people probably won't use this feature but for those that do it will be a bummer. (FP mode and ND filters can help with this though)I also love the face recognition on this camera.  When I am taking group photos, the faces that I really care about are my families'.  Now I can register 6 peoples' faces and it will focus on them.  NiceVIDEOIn many ways, this camera lacks some of the features of a dedicated video recorder.  So why would I want to use this camera?  After all, you can get a G1 and HD video recorder for the same price as this camera.  There are two main reasons.  The first  reason is Depth of Field (DOF).  As I mentioned earlier the micro 4/3 sensor has 4 times more area than the 2/3 sensor used for many TV shows and is 22 times more area than many video recorders.  Smaller sensors = larger DOF.  This makes it harder to isolate your subject from the background by having the background out of focus.  Pay attention to movies when you watch them and you will notice how they shift focus to \"highlight\" their subject.  If you have wondered why you can't do that with a home video recorder, now you know.  If you shoot with a F4 lens on a 4/3 system you will need a .8 aperture on a 1/4 system to get the same DOF (by the way there is no such home video recorder).  The second major reason to use the GH1 is the ability to change lenses.  Right now there are not many micro 4/3 lenses.  However, the micro 4/3 format is so flexible that, with an adaptor you can use just about any camera lens you want (Nikon, Canon, Leica, etc).  The trade off is that you lose autofocus and metering with most non-4/3 lenses.  The ability to change lenses  grants two major benefits.  First, you can put all sorts of exotic lenses on.  For example if you put on a 7mm lens, you would give your video a perspective not often seen in home footage.  On a 1/4 sensor of a video recorder you would need a 1.4mm lens to get the same perspective as the 7mm on the 4/3 system.  (Most camcorders are not going to go wider than 4mm which is roughly equivalent to a 20mm lens on a 4/3 system.)  Secondly, you can put exceedingly \"fast\" (a fast lens is one with a low aperture number.  A lower aperture number means more light hitting the sensor so you can run your shutter speed faster.  Hence fast lens) lenses on to get shallow DOF.  You could easily put a f1.4 lens on this camera.  You would need a f0.3 lens to get the equivalent DOF on a 1/4 sensor.Anyway, it is relatively easy to make beautiful videos with this camera; especially in the 720p/60 mode.  This is the first \"stills\" camera that has the ability to autofocus and track while filming.  Additionally, it has two built in microphones for stereo sound recording and these work surprisingly well.  Finally, the lens is utterly silent so the focusing and aperture changes will not ruin the sound of any video you are shooting.A negative that I have heard for this system is that it lacks a powered zoom ability that most camcorders have (you can manually zoom the lens).  I again view this as another positive.  One the best ways to make your footage look amateur is to zoom while filming (I do it too and it frustrates me when I see the footage).  It is exceedingly rare that a camera is zoomed in a hollywood movie.  When it does happen it is done for a reason.  The lack of a motorized zoom may help people make better movies.There are a couple of caveats that you need to be aware of when shooting movies with this camera especially in 1080p/24 mode. (For an in-depth discussion I would refer you to the Luminous Landscape GH1 review.  I am just trying to make you aware that 1080p/24 mode is not a beginner mode on this camera.)  The first is that you will need extra software to edit the 1080p/24 mode.  The second is that you want to set the shutter speed to 1/50 for the 1080p/24 mode.  Lastly, if you want to use the wider apertures to get the smaller depth of fields then you will need some neutral density filters to put over the lens in bright light (On a bright day at f2.8 you could easily need 1/6400, to properly expose at ISO200.  7 Stops of ND and you are down to 1/50!).  These are some of the pitfalls that plague shooting video and in order to get the results you are looking for you will need to be aware of them.OVERALLThis is a fantastic camera.  It obviously has places in which it can improve.  However, for the current state-of-the-art, this camera, for 95% of people, is head and shoulders above anything else out there.  Panasonic's contrast detect autofocus has raised the bar and no more excuses can be made for this type of autofocus system.  (It probably heralds the extinction of the DSLR)  Based around this, Panasonic has reengineered the \"DSLR\" from scratch and has created an outstanding stills camera and an excellent video camera all-in-on.  It's a great time to be a photographer!", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Panasonic GH1 Review (revisited)", "Author": "Glenn Przyborski", "ReviewID": "R3KMRFXS9TL65S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With the GH1, Panasonic has succeeded in creating a digital \"SLR\" for people with tiny hands. The camera looks and feels in perfect proportion if you're a third grader or a very, very tiny adult. As a 6' 2\" male, with average sized hands, it's very hard to pick-up or handle the GH1 without inadvertently pressing a button.As a director/cinematographer who primarily works in TV, I purchased the GH1 to shoot inconspicuous \"B-Roll\".  We use larger cameras and multi-person crews to shoot in controlled situations, such as studios or planned locations. However, it's not unusual to need quick, available-light cutaways.  For example, actors crossing a busy street with lots of out-of-focus pedestrians walking by. On a recent shoot in Washington DC, I needed to grab a 1080P cutaway of our actors walking near the steps of the US Capitol building. A quick and easy shot with the GH1, a very paperwork intensive and costly cutaway though normal channels.My comments that follow relate to my personal GH1 camera, serial # WE9HB0014xxThe camera takes very good quality stills, but my comments relate to the camera's ability to shoot 24P 1080 HD video.Here's what I like about the GH1's video capabilities...The Panasonic's Micro 4-3 is an excellent sized imager. It yields a depth-of-field that's almost like academy aperture 35mm motion picture film (with the top & bottom cut off to yield a 16 x 9 image.) It's a good, practical size compromise and more than twice as big as 2/3\".The 14mm-140mm lens that's included with the camera is very sharp, but it's only an F4 (wide) to F5.6 (telephoto.)  If you're shooting quality indoor or low-light cinematography, you'll want \"bigger glass.\"NOTE: I have noticed that the GH1's 1080P AVCHD encoded picture seems to look better with fixed (non-Panasonic) lenses. The GH1 has sophisticated digital signal processing to help correct optical short falls in Panasonic lenses. Based on focus and zoom settings, the camera modifies the image to minimize pincushioning and barrel distortion. Several people on the web theorized that all these complicated, processor intensive corrections use up much of the camera's processor capability and the video encoding suffers. At first I thought the argument was impossible, but now I think there maybe something to this.What's great about the physical size of the sensor & mount is that almost any lens can be easily adapted to the GH1. Without the space normally occupied by a mirror box, the flange distance between the lens mount and imager is shorter than any other 35mm SLR or 35mm movie camera. Ebay has many vendors who sell inexpensive adapters to allow Nikon, Canon, Arriflex, Minolta, Olympus... virtually any lens, including some C-mount models, to be adapted to the GH1 without any loss in image quality or F-stop. Remember that adapted lenses need to have manual iris and manual focus control.As far as I know, this camera is the only one of its kind to incorporate a very high quality electronic viewfinder in addition to a good quality, articulating LCD screen. On all the Nikon and Canon D-SLR models, once you switch to the \"liveview\" or movie mode, the mirror flips up and only the LCD on the rear of the camera is usable. LCD's are hard to see in bright daylight, especially for critical focusing. No matter what you've read in other reviews, the electronic viewfinder in the GH1 is very good and very sharp.Battery life on the GH1 is amazing. I've walked all over Pittsburgh shooting scenes and never had to change the battery. The manual indicates less than 3 watts of power usage with the LCD active.The GH1 does a pretty decent job of down-scaling the 12 MP imager to the 2.2 MP required for the 1080 HD format. There's a tiny problem with aliasing on vertical or diagonal lines, but it's not bad or very noticeable.  Overall the color quality and ability to handle contrast and lighting extremes is very good. The GH1 does an excellent job of rolling over exposed areas smoothly into clipped white with minimal color contamination.Three things I hate about the GH1's HD video capabilities:1.  The camera has a very, very poor implementation of the AVCHD codec.  Panasonic in one of the owners of AVCHD, so there's no excuse for this. The camera inserts an \"I\" frame or key frame into the encoded video stream every 15 frames. If you have a locked down shot, you will see a slight change in the video twice every second. Static things like grass or other fine detail areas will appear to slightly twitch.  It's visible but not as apparent in hand-held or scenes with action or camera motion.2.  The VBR (variable bit rate) encoding simply cannot deal with rapid motion. A quick pan such as following a passing car will yield very digitized looking motion with tons of artifacts. To overcome items #1 & #2, you literally have to compose shots that have some motion, but not too much motion.3.  Panasonic has elected to incorporate some form of digital noise reduction into the video signal path to minimize or eliminate grain or noise before encoding. Another huge problem... If you're shooting a scene with areas of minimal contrast or detail, the camera will simply blur that area together to form a continuous blur of color. This reduces the work load of the encoder, but yields a very \"consumer quality\" video signal. This effect only happens in low-contrast areas. A static scene of a forrest with reveal that the dark brown or gray of tree trunks have little or no detail. Similarly colored dark bricks on a building will be just a big soft patch of dark red. Imagine having low resolution in certain areas of your scene. You can not turn this noise reduction \"blending\" effect off.  (see addendum update below)Hopefully, Panasonic is working to fix or minimize the problems with the AVCHD codec and video noise reduction as a future firmware update. Some blogs are organizing email campaigns to plead with Panasonic to address the pathetic AVCHD encoding and other video problems.Please note that I am very familiar with the AVCHD encoding used in Canon's older HF-10, HF-11 and newer HF-S10 and other inexpensive cameras.  At the same 17mb/s data rate, I've never seen the problems indicated above. Possibly the Panasonic AVCHD encoder was jeopardized by having to encode in multiple formats.  Also, the AVCHD format allows for 23.976fps video, not just 29.97fps. It's a lot easier and cleaner to encode true 24P (23.976)  than a 29.97 interlaced signal with 3-2 pulldown.Other video related \"things\" that I wish I knew before purchase...I was surprised to find out that autofocus only works with Panasonic brand lenses.  I purchased the expensive, extremely sharp, Olympus Zuiko 14mm-35mm F2 lens and Panasonic's DMW-MA1 4/3 to micro 4/3 adapter. The camera can control this $2,000 lens' iris, but despite all the gold contacts in the adapter, no autofocus.  One slight plus is that the GH1 will digitally zoom into the imager for easy manual focus whenever you turn the lens focus ring. (This focus assist effect does not happen when you're recording.)The stereo mic connector, which doubles as the remote control jack, is 3/32\" of an inch, not the usual 1/8\". Like the other DSLR's there is no method to monitor your audio recording in any way. No headphone jack and no LCD audio level indication.  When using an external mic, always check any important shot for audio before you move on to another scene. I was pleasantly surprised that the GH1 does a respectable job of controlling audio levels from an external mic without pumping or other audible compression effects. It's acceptable audio for B-Roll cutaway footage.The GH1 will not output a signal on the HDMI connector or analog component connector while recording or setting up a shot.The GH1 adjusts its iris in 1/3 f-stop steps. If you're using auto iris when shooting video, a pan from light to dark will yield distinct steps in brightness as the lens opens. When shooting video on the GH1, I manually set my desired ASA (ISO) speed setting and set the shutter to 1/50. There is a button to the immediate left of the video record button that locks the iris until the button is pressed again. This is great when shooting rapid fire cutaways in changing light situations.The addition of HD video is what creates the huge demand and back log for cameras like the GH1, Canon 7D and others. If only manufacturers would wake up and concentrate on a camera's video and audio capabilities and quality instead of thinking of video as secondary to still photography.Addendum: After shooting numerous, available light cutaways with the GH1, I've found certain settings that work very well in the movie mode, much better than Panasonic's default settings. By using the \"Smooth\" setting, combined with contrast at -2, sharpness at 0, color at 0, and NR (noise reduction) at -2 the 1080P video quality is much better. I've been using the camera with Nikon AF-D and Canon FD series lenses and simple, non-optical, lens mount adapters. Although you still have codec problems with rapid pans, I don't seem to notice much of the \"mudding\" effects that myself and other users of this camera have mentioned in low-light areas. I didn't really appreciate the GH1 until I briefly owned a Canon 7D. When compared to the 7D, the GH1's 1080P video is visibly sharper with more fine detail. It's also free of moir\u00e9 patterns and most aliasing artifacts that occur when you're shooting video scenes that include sharp horizontal lines. Examples of problem scenes for the 7D include patterns of bricks on a building or the grill of an automobile.  (In fairness to Canon, the 7D is a much better still camera and its imager appears to be about one F-stop more sensitive to light)", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera, but probably not for everyone", "Author": "L. Lou", "ReviewID": "RPP7DKIBMPMFR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really think Panasonic has hit upon something quite amazing with this \"hybrid\" camera, though whether or not the video/still capabilities will be worth it to you will depend on how you want to shoot.This is my first DSLR-like camera, but the transition has been nearly seamless after owning several point and shoots, consumer-grade camcorders, and a film SLR over the years. I've had the Japanese version for almost two months now, taken 2000 photos and several hours of video, and have only found more reasons to love it, despite a few notable flaws.Image quality is surprisingly good, rivaling the APS-C sensor DSLRs from Nikon and Canon (Imaging Resource has some nice comparisons against the Nikon D5000 and Canon T1i). Images keep detail well in higher ISOs, though sensor noise is a problem at low-light shots taken at ISO 1600 and above, with sometimes severe sensor noise visible in bands across flat, dark areas of an image. Luckily, sensor noise is much less of an issue shooting HD video in low light, even at ISO 1600.Video capture is stunning... in the right hands. Having only owned mid-range, consumer-grade camcorders in the past, my knowledge of shooting video is extremely minimal, so I've mostly shot in Intelligent Auto mode, which has worked wonderfully for my home videos. The image stabilization (though unfortunately lens-based), continuous autofocus, face and AF tracking are lifesavers for the untalented videographer, and will greatly help the skilled veteran. However, the GH1 is NOT a pro camcorder, and so will not perform as fast (though will match up admirably to a consumer-grade camcorder). Unless you really need 1080/24p, 720/60p is a much better option for video, as it takes up less room, has a higher frame rate, and is of higher quality with fewer compression artifacts. The \"low data rate\" issue that H. Massey mentioned is based on an incomplete/inaccurate understanding of HD video capture and in-camera compression; the oft-quoted 17 mb/s data rate will not affect the quality of the video ([...]). Sound capture is very impressive using the built-in stereo mic, but you've got the option to plug a much better mic into the stereo line-in jack.I absolutely love the handling of the camera. The size and weight allow me to run around and shoot for an entire day without feeling its weight or bulk around my neck (and I am an admittedly weak and petite woman). The articulating LCD is amazing for framing the perfect shot without fatigue, and both it and the EVF have amazingly high pixel densities and frame rates that will soon ease (though not completely eliminate) worries about the lack of an optical viewfinder. Speaking of which, though peeking into the EVF will leave you disoriented in a bad way at first, it is VERY good after more use. It gains nicely in low-light, though it will be very useless if you don't have enough light to read a watch (the non-glowing kind). It's wonderful for eyestrain-free shooting at a dark musical performance, but shooting moving subjects outside in the daytime makes me long for an optical viewfinder.The controls on the camera work as expected, though the menu system is a bit of a mess. The main menu changes based on what mode is set via the mode dial, which is disorienting at first, but makes sense upon further thought. Unfortunately, Panasonic is nowhere near Canon in the sophistication of menu designs, and you will be forced to dig through a rather unattractive 6-page menu for certain options. There is a special menu that displays the last 5 options you accessed, which should ease the pain just a bit.All in all, I've found the GH1 to be a wonderful camera. As someone who likes to just walk and shoot, it has been great for framing shots quickly and capturing half a dozen pictures without falling out of pace. The video capturing capabilities have also gotten me interested in video more than any of my camcorders ever has. Videographers considering getting into still photography may thus want to consider this camera as well. Together with the versatile zoom lens, it's a great kit that will last me a looonnng time without upgrades (very nice on my budget, despite the initial kick in the wallet). I'm giving it 4 stars because, despite my love for it, it can DEFINITELY use some improvements before I start shouting its praises off rooftops.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Defective Lens Mount", "Author": "A. Harrison", "ReviewID": "R2HOI0RV5ECVJA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Like many other folks, I received a unit with a defective lens mount.  The lens twists back and forth by a substantial amount.  I am returning my camera.Did a little testing while I had it.  My background is as a cinematographer and coder of digital imaging software.  First and foremost, the four thirds format with interchangeable lenses blows away all current video cameras, including those costing $5000.  Not only does the larger sensor give better control over depth of field, it changes the geometry of what you shoot, giving you a much wider field of view without the signature \"video\" look.  I will never buy another video camera with a 1/3 or even 2/3 inch sensor again.  Of course this is not unique to the GH1.  There are several large sensor DSLRs on the market now.The flip out, fully articulated monitor is super handy.  Every camera should be this way.  Why would anyone want to squat down and twist their neck to take a simple low angle shot with a regular fixed monitor camera?  It seems obvious.  The monitor is incredibly bright and sharp.The zoom on the GH1 kit lens is bizarrely stiff, which makes you twist the whole camera to zoom when filming.In the category of dumb things from the past that should have died long ago, the full HD 24p mode is encoded as 60i with pulldown.  Your footage will look terrible if played back directly, or you must use software to remove the pulldown.  Even with pulldown \"removed\" you end up with visible interlace ghosting due to the fields being encoded separately.  Furthermore, pulldown wastes bitrate, since it basically splits each image in two and compresses them separately, even though they are almost identical images.  Result is lower quality images with more compression artifacts for the same bitrate.  As it is, the image quality at 1080 is barely sufficient, has trails lasting 1-2 frames at times.The 720 mode can only be 60p, and has no option for 24p or 30p.  Weird, since most people would generally want to shoot at 24p, unless they were filming sports or slow motion.  Including 24p and 30p modes would allow for less compression and higher image quality for the same bitrate.I noticed in photo mode, the monitor has some auto-gain feature, so you don't actually see the photo you are about to take.  Very annoying.  I couldn't figure out if it could be disabled.In automatic modes, like auto-iso, or aperture priority, the camera does not display the choices it is making.  It just displays blank.  So you have no idea what you are getting.Speaking of automatic, the audio recording level is completely automatic.  You have ABSOLUTELY no control over it.  The constantly changing \"automatic\" recording levels cause background noise, like traffic to become louder whenever there are no other sounds, and then loud sounds, such as someone talking in a commanding voice near the mic, can blow out.  Its hard not to despise people who take control away from you and \"help you\" by supplying something \"automatic\" that makes it then impossible to do something you typically need to do.  Hopefully Panasonic will someday update the firmware to give you a simple recording level control.  It would be great as well to get audio level meters too so you have some notion of what you are getting from any external mic you attach.  As it is now, you have no idea if the mic is even working.The digital zoom feature is backwards, for filming at least.  The image is already being reduced from the sensor's 4K resolution to 1080 or 720.  You would think digital zoom would crop out the center of the 4K image, which has tons of extra resolution.  Instead digital zoom crops out the center of the 1080 or 720 image, giving you an ugly, super low res, soft, blocky, useless image.The default sharpening level of \"zero\" gives you a heavily sharpened image with strong halos and artifacts around edges.  Setting sharpening to the minimum (-2) appears to still force you to take some sharpening.  Sharpening is an anathema to good post production image processing.The noise reduction smears the chroma channels, introducing significant artifacts along edges.  For example, if you film text on the page of a book in good light, it will appear to be covered with colored smudges.  Turning it all the way down improved my images significantly.The aperture adjusts in discrete steps when filming in shutter priority mode.  The resulting sudden \"steps\" in brightness make it useless for any serious work.  A shame, since this is normally the best automatic mode for filming if you are not going full manual.  Also, I could hear the lens changing aperture, a sound will be audible to a mic on a boom in especially quiet environments.The autofocus snaps very quickly when filming.  It would be nice if this could be slowed down so as not to be so abrupt and to feel more natural.I witnessed some pretty serious aliasing, suggesting their downsampling algorithm is not so good.  For example, if you film tiny christmas lights from a bit of a distance, and pan slowly, you will see individual lights literally appear and then completely disappear, and then appear again.Having a choice between mjpeg and avchd is awesome.  If they would add mjpeg2000, you could get much, much better images for the same bitrate than mjpeg.Finally, it would be super cool if camera makers would start offering wider aspect ratios, like 2:1.  16:9 is great, but with all those extra pixels in the 4K sensor, why not give filmmakers some of the typical movie aspect ratios to play with?

It was most certainly for it's 1080/24 and 720/60 video functionality. And let me tell you, it is awesome. Many have reported about the \"mud\" that you receive when shooting 1080/24 because of the AVCHD codec. I have seen this but only when I was shooting with a fast shutter because I was out in bright daylight. But when I switched to 1/30 and stepped up my aperture setting the video seemed to look fine even during fast pans.No live video or audio monitoring. But this was never meant to be a prosumer camera so what do you expect for only $1500. However, these are certainly things that Panasonic can fix with a firmware upgrade. The only thing I question may be it's low light performance. But even at ISO 1600, the noise to me is much more tolerable than the noise that my old DVX100 would get even though you probably could see more with the DVX100 in the same low light conditions.But I would not attribute the low light performance to the camera but to the slow kit lens it comes with. However, that doesn't mean this kit lens is a bad one. It still is pretty good because it is very quiet when it auto focuses and the OIS stabilizer is pretty darn good too. Oh yeah, it's a 10 zoom lens so its 140 mm focal length gets you pretty good shallow depth of field, which is something that many older prosumer video cameras (such as my DVX100) could not do.Bottom line is I am a very happy camper with Panasonic's Lumix GH1.

No --- but in 1080i it's more than good enough for a short action shot here and there.

I loved the camera but decided that I missed a lot of shots because the camera was too big to carry and it was sitting at home. As a result, I has a string of smaller top end cameras including the Leica D-Lux 2 (a great camera).

The GH1 takes incredible, well saturated photos but also takes among the best HD video i've seen, all in a very compact body. The best part is that you can change out the kit lens with a pancake lens from Panasonic or Olympus and have an (almost) pocketable, SLR-like, high end camera.Don't believe the things that you read about AVCHD being a subpar codec.

You can shoot in all the sames modes, with all the same buttons and functions that you are used to using to take photos in video mode as well. It's a great design!

We simply wanted to capture the moment with our family and children and not wait forever for the point and shoot camera and then realize the picture quality was sub par after the fact either because lighting was not ideal or the point and shoot took 2-3 seconds to take the next shot. After a lot of internet research and in store handling of the cameras we narrowed it down to the Panasonic Lumix GH1, Nikon D5000 and Canon T1i. All of them seemed like great cameras but we bought the Panasonic Lumix GH1 over those for several reasons that I outlined below. During the process it was also apparent that depending on which store you walked into each of them had their own reasons and incentives why they want to sell you a particular brand. Do your homework and research and base your decision on that, not a sales associate or store that receives added incentives to sell 1 brand vs the other. We found that most camera folks were not necessarily educated on Micro 4/3's cameras yet.  90% of the retailers did not even carry the Panasonic Lumix G line. This product should be on all the major retail shelves with the Nikons and Canons of the world. Come on Panasonic, you are missing the boat.  Get your product in the major retailers!!Here are our reasons why we selected the GH1.#1 - GH1 is smaller & lighter than other DSLR's making it more portable, especially with 20mm pancake lens.#2 - The video capabilities of the GH1 are superior, no comparison with Nikon and Canon. Silent lens, zoom abilities,etc.#3 - Picture quality was equal amongst D5000 and T1i at typical settings that an average joe would use. Extreme ISO settings the Nikon was better but for practical use that had no significance for us.#4 - All of the Panasonic lenses are smaller in addition to a smaller body, not sure if that is a Micro 4/3's thing or simply a Panasonic thing.#5 - Camera build feels solid.I recommend buying the 20mm pancake lens as well so you can make this completely portable.

Wooten", "ReviewID": "R1117C452Y3422", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the GH1 as a second camera to my larger Canon system, replacing a Canon S5 IS. It was a big jump price-wise but I wanted the improved video quality I'd been reading about. I've always had Canons, so getting this camera was a personal big deal. However, I have not been disappointed. Panasonic has done a very nice job designing the camera's controls and menus. The top right layout of controls is very, very nice. Everything I like to do easily available. No more hunting for that hidden menu for exposure bracketing or the timer. And after I got the hang of the Quick Menu options, I find I'm using them a lot: very well conceived and thought out. The two things I loved about the Canon S5 IS are also part of the GH1: the articulating LCD screen and the red button on the back to immediately activate video. However, the LCD screen is more reflective in bright sun than the Canon's, so I'm forced to use the viewfinder more than I like (perfectly fine in lower light situations, both outdoors and indoors). That viewfinder is taking some getting used to but after a couple of weeks of moderate use, I've got the hang of it. The video is exactly as I'd hoped. I'm amazed at its ability to maintain focus and exposure on moving subjects. I practiced at a dog park so the camera got a good workout: lots of quick movement towards and away from me and shifts from sun to shade. The camera adjusted quickly and silently. It is, however, too heavy for one-handed use (which I was able to do with the Canon S5 IS), so I'm having to adjust to two-handed video recording; of course, that's necessary anyway to adjust the zoom. Finally the camera feels substantial and well-made.UPDATE: I've recently returned from a week-long vacation during which I used the GH1 very heavily. Thankfully I had a second battery because about 2/3 through each day, the first battery was exhausted. A bit of a surprise as I am used to the longevity of Canon's batteries. So, a second battery is a definite must for this camera. Also, I got the Lumix G 20mm F1.7 lens as my vacation included lots of museum and cathedral visits. Fantastic lens. Obviously great in low light situations and I hardly missed the ability to zoom at all. Video's great with this lens, although the auto focus makes noise that the microphone picks up. I highly recommend this lens. And about the video, one of the main reasons I got this camera in the first place: the HD quality of the videos is fantastic. The ability to spontaneously shift from stills to video on this trip allowed me to get some wonderful action videos, which in turn I've been able to take great snapshots from.

Haynes", "ReviewID": "R20P5Y8ENG5WRU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is for the GH1 in shooting video.  Stills-wise, it is very good but doesn't compare to the Nikon cameras and lenses we use for production stills so we've rarely used it for photography.As a cinematographer and director making broadcast documentaries, I picked up a GH1 a few months ago as a 'suicide camera' - a lock off camera to use in dangerous industrial areas where we didn't care if it survived or not.  But the GH1 proved so good that we quickly developed it as a secondary camera on all shoots - it is now a part of our standard kit alongside Sony HDCAM cameras.There are a lot of indepth reviews on the GH1 so I'll just add some of the most important aspects from our experience...Video quality is excellent (with the hack) and sits nicely in our shows alongside the main HDCAM footage.  We use it for picks ups, awkward/dangerous places, timelapses and B Roll.  Converted to ProRes or imported direct to Avid MC the quality is dependable and good.Choice of lenses.  The stock lens is pretty good - we've used it in all sorts of places.  But the true gift of the GH1 is being able to use lenses from other systems via adaptors.  We use ours with Nikon lenses (70-200, 24-70, macro and superwide angle glass) as well as the Voigtlander 40mm f1.4 - which gives a beautiful look.  Adaptors are available on ebay and cheap.  Have a play.The stock lens has stabilisation - which is very good - any other type of lens does not.  But use the thing on a tripod - or a mount for mobile work.Rotating flip out screen - very useful for those awkward spots or lower angles on the tripod.  Once you've fitted a Zacuto finder on it though it tends to droop.  Jam some gaffer tape on the hinge to help.  Using one of the Canon's without a flip out screen is a true pain for real world filming.Autofocus.  We tested it but avoid it.  I never use autofocus on our cameras - don't even have it on the high end ones of course.  Its nice that you can move the autofocus area around on the screen - so you don't have to keep your subject centered - but ultimately it is too easy for the auto to fix on something else - and in the heat of the action it isn't always obvious that it is shifting focus from one thing to another.  Autofocus not available on other brand lenses of course.No zebras - so use the histogram - it works just fine.Can set color temp direct - dial in degs K.  This is a very nice feature missing on a lot of high end minicams even.There are a vast array of accessories for the HDDSLR world - largely because they are a pain to use mobile.  But you don't need everything you see, tempting tho it is.  Essentials are Audio system, ND Filter and Zacuto style viewfinder hood (I know there are other types but the Zacuto seems best to me).  That'll give a good working system.  Shoulder mounts, follow focus and matte boxes etc depend on your style of shooting - we have them but tend to use the GH1 with just the ND filter and a clip on lens hood.Takes a Zacuto finder ok - if you use the Jr you'll need the special GH1 mount - available from Zacuto direct.  You really do need something like this to be able to use any HDDSLR in the field - and they help in handheld stability as well so are worth the money.  You can also switch them between cameras so it's not an investment only for the GH1.The electronic viewfinder is really very good - and perfectly good enough for a lot of work.  But the flip out screen allows better use on a tripod.ND Filters.  Can't get around this - you need one/several depending on type.  We settled on the Singh Ray (the Fader ND is cheaper and supposed to be equally good) and it does the job nicely.  Buy a clip on lens hood and you can do away with a matte box for a lot of work.  The filter rotates but the clip on hood is easy to shift back into position.  The 77mm thread of the Singh Ray fits directly to the front of Nikon professional glass, and accepts the Nikon lens cap.As with audio and Zacuto style finders, your ND filter will work with other HDDSLRs so isn't a wasted investment.Audio.  You need an external recorder and decent mics.  Same is true for any of the HDDSLR cams - most of which have worse mics than the built in stereo mics of the gh1.  Nothing you can do about it - bite the bullet and pickup an external recorder - we use a Sony PCM-D50 because we had one around - but there are a bunch of cheaper ones available.  The GH1 audio track is then used for sync - buy a clapper board and look ridiculous or click your fingers for free.SD cards are cheap.  Very.  Buy loads.  I love them - and have filmed with P2, SxS as well as every type of tape.  Get Class 6 at least to cope with the higher data rates with the hack.  Class 10 better.I've used the GH1 in a range of environments - including the desert in 127 degrees of mid-day heat.  It runs hot but still works.  Battery life is good - but if it's your main camera then get spares.It's a little small - easy to hit buttons accidentally as you use it.  The menu system is straightforward.

How so? The firmware has been hacked and you can achieve AVCHD/MJPEG bitrates much higher then what Panasonic had initially crippled this camera for. What does that mean to the end consumer? Well if you were to remain \"true blue\" and keep the firmware legit you'd be hitting a maximum 15mbps (megabit per second) video bandwidth which is solid for a hand held still camera, but less then adequate for modern consumer and/or prosumer recording. Things such as \"mudiness\" or pixelation while filming is expected within a 15mbps cap. When you hack the firmware (thanks to a very skilled enthusiast) you can reach bitrates as high as 80mbps which is on par if not exceeding professional broadcast and certain film cameras. The result is nothing less then stunning - no pixellation, mudiness, noise or rolling shutter - just pure unadulterated pristine video worthy of a camera costing 10-15X the amount.There are trade-offs though: for example you may lose video playback on the camera due to the nature of video stream (it's too high for the processor to playback internally). You may also of course damage the camera if you make mistake while upgrading or even void the warranty (verdict is still out on the latter, but I would assume so). Nonetheless if you're intrigued by photography or HD video making this camera purchase is a no-brainer.The stills I have taken with this camera are gorgeous. The stock kit of a 14-140mm wide-angle lens with Optical Image Stabilization is quite impressive as well. They are different though then let's say a Nikon DSLR, because you're dealing with a different size sensor (micro four-thirds). But the capability of mounting one of your ungodly-expensive Nikon lenses to this camera (with the after-market mount you can readily found on eBay or even here at Amazon - no vignetting, thank you) along with the quality, durability and portability of this camera suffices a purchase in my book.

After reviewing all of the m4/3rds and many larger options I decided the GH1 would be the camera I would get.  So far, it's been a GREAT camera.I've mostly stuck with the iA feature as I need to (re)learn a lot about photography.  Any way pictures have already come out much better with this camera than the ps cameras I previously used (one of the reasons for the upgrade).  Most, if not all, of the picture quality \"problems\" I have with this camera is related to me needing to learn about technique (correct holding, focal length, exposure, iso, etc).Video (another reason I got this camera) is amazing.  The choice between recording at 1080p and 720p (the one I use) boils done to image quality versus frame rate (24 versus 60, sidenote: Panny is coming out with a camcorder version by year end which should make this choice irrelevant).  At first, I would accidentally hit the record button while trying to take a picture, but now don't have that happening.  Of course I now have to spend more money on a tripod, as I've learned my ability to pan handheld is horrible.This camera comes with the 14-140mm lens. A huge range (also another reason for purchasing this camera).  I can sit at a beach and get a panoramic view of 5 beach volleyball courts or zoom in and notice the polka dot pattern on a bikini bottom.  When I was first looking at this camera I thought about what other additional lenses I should purchase, but now don't foresee needing them.I mainly use the EVF, but the articulating LCD screen has come in handy for composing shoots at alternative angles.  According to the specs using the LCD doesn't cause much of a battery drain (something like 110 minutes versus 120 minutes full on picture taking or video recording).Of course this camera is bigger than a ps in both size and weight (over 2 pounds with the lens).  But I've carried it all day and didn't notice the weight.  Also this camera may seem expensive, but if you get a GF1 you'll need to spend money on an EVF and an additional lens (45-200mm) to have a  setup that is comparable in ability ... as well as size, weight, and price.I do recommend this camera, but you need to decide if it's right for you.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the rest of us", "Author": "S.

This camera is very well built, and although it's pricey (I paid just under $1200 thru Amazon), I was willing to pay more for a camera that would have greater flexibility and long term usability.  I was a little surprised at first that the zoom was manual (unlike compacts that have a motorized motion), but after using it I don't think you need it because you have to use two hands anyway to steady the camera at zoom length and it's very natural to hold the camera with one hand while resting the lens with the other in the palm of the hand and twisting to zoom.

Since I was mostly putting the output on the web, photo frame and in video productions, I liked, but did not need \"National Geographic\" quality. But I do have enough talent to occasionally take a NatGeo quality photo. So on to the camera....Have a tough time grading this camera. So will thow some thoughts out there see if they stick with you. First, I'm excited about the micro four thirds (m4/3) format, as I believe it'll give the non-pros 80% of the pro level with a lot less stuff to drag around. I look for good things to come.That said, I am disappointed at the lack of bright lenses, save the 20mm f1.7. On the other hand, I've been able to mount (film) SLR lenses that date back to the 1970's on my Panny. I've had fun buying a Canon FD 200mm f/2.8 and a Nikkor F 35mm F/2.0 lens (and more!) for a song on e-bay along with appropriate adapters. I shoot these in program AE or AP mode. In addition to manual apeture, you must manual focus, and it can focus beyond infinity, therefore I only suggest these old lenses for those comfortable using manual mode. It's pretty cool to have a camera that does a competent job with this fine old glass. Incidentally, F/1.4 and below seems to be somewhat softer than same lens stopped to f2/0-f/8. True of many lenses tested. That said at equivalent focal lengths, the 25-30 year old lenses are sharper than the kit lens. But it's incremental, I doubt most casual shoortes would notice.My biggest gripe with the camera is the overall softness of the still image using the kit lens. (Video is fine, but then again, it's moving) It's sharp up to about 100mm and f/8 or lower, at f/16 or f/32, it's soft no matter what focal length. To be fair, I will submit I may not have sufficient digicam experience, as I am mostly a video guy. This may just be the way things are with the current imaging technology in RAW. To wit; I did side-by-side shoot with Canon Xti with EFS 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 and EF 70-300 f/4-f5.6 vs The Panny with the kit 14-140 lens. I found the Canon slightly sharper overall, barely noticable up to 150mm (35mm equiv on both), and more noticably at telephoto --> but not as much as I expected. Frankly, I felt both to be soft. So maybe the perception of softness is due to the camera technology itself. These were all raw files compared in Adobe Bridge, no tweaking.Another gripe as reflected by another reviewer is the camera's penchant in auto mode for selecting slow shutter speed when higher ISO would be more appropriate. Hopefully this will come as a firmware update. Panny has been pretty diligent with updating firmware for both the camera and the lens.That said, I utterly love the video features. I mostly shoot in 720p60, since I shoot fast motion. I agree with the rolling shutter complaints on video, but overall they are not going to be noticed by most casual users. For those inclined to push the camera, there are hacks out there ([...]) that will give you 1080p at higher bit and frame rates. (1080p @50Mb fast enough for you?) I don't have the courage to risk bricking my camera, so can't comment on it.As for price, I believe the camera is a fair value at $1500. While I would have loved a brighter lens, I recognize the breakthru the stepless apeture lens represents (silent operation of the lens, critical for video) and while mostly plastic for reduced weight, overall build quality makes the camera a bargain. If you did the same thing with the Nikon D90, 5000 or Canon T1i, the two lenses you'd need to buy along with the body is within a couple hundred of the Panny's price. PLUS you'd need to drag around another lens (in a bag) OR buy a super zoom lens that itself weighs more than the Panny+Lens combo does.What you need to know is in checking them ALL out, even the vaunted EOS5D MKII, the Panny IMO was easiest to just pick up and shoot good video with. I went down a zipline alternating rapidly between video and stills in auto mode. Also shot on moving horseback. The articulating screen in 16x9 proportion should not be underestimated. Yes the live view is jerky in low light, you lose detail in the electronic viewfinder (EVF), but can still frame ok... The EVF is not as bad as detractors make it out to be and the resulting video/still looks about as good as if it came from a comparable Canon/Nikon.Amazingly, the video/photo even at ISO 1600 is not that bad... I no longer fear high ISO. GH1 does a nice job of smoothing camera noise at these speeds. I have to say, it's a fun camera to just plain shoot with. My wife, who cares not about her husband's obsession with depth of field, f-stops and focal lengths just puts it in auto and gets great results in both video and photo. You can achieve compositional creativity much quicker with this camera than the DSLR contenders IMO. It's a good camera for those who want to step up from the point/shoot, but feel intimidated by the DSLR's myriad of knobs and buttons.Finally, while it's not the smallest/lightest camera in the world, the package IS small/light enough to make it acceptable to carry all over a theme park, or moutain trail for a 12 hour day. Without lens hood, it's about as tall as a Coke can and about like carrying a 12oz bottle of beer. When researching I was all set to buy a Nikon/Canon. But one thing that resonated on numerous forums was people talking about missing a shot beacuse they left the \"too big/heavy\" camera at home. I wanted a still/video camera I would carry and this is it. That's the bottom line, isn't it?TIP: Look on Amazon for \"bino buddy\" it makes a great strap replacement for this camera. I've gone 20 miles on horseback, hiked and done other active outdoor activities with this rig.Update Aug 1, 2010: I have tried the Panny 7-14mm and Oly 9-18mm lenses (See those reviews). Happily they have made me eat my words on softness. I also think some firmware updates and Adobe Lightroom 3 have helped with the primary lens as well. Almost a year into owning this camera, I can still say I am very satisfied I took the risk with the (then) largely untested micro 4/3 format. I think it's a real winner.

If you're looking for a camera that will double as an excellent digital still camera and as a top notch camcorder, there really is no other choice that comes close to the DMC-GH1.And while it has been rightly noted by some that this camera is expensive, it does represent a good value when you consider what all it can do -- and especially when you factor in the outstanding 14-140mm kit lens that comes with the camera.  What's good about the DMC-GH1?  Well:-Interchangeable lenses and the flexibility of a D-SLR in a slightly smaller, lighter package than any D-SLR on the market.-Performance as a still camera that comes very close to an APS-C D-SLR.  I say \"close\" because those D-SLRs do have a slightly larger image sensor than the DMC-GH1, and that does give them a bit of an advantage in low light conditions. Compared to other Micro 4/3 format cameras, however, I would rank the DMC-GH1 as being outstanding -- it beats the competition, including the other cameras that Panasonic makes, thanks to a better sensor in the DMC-GH1.-Performance as a video camera that beats the heck out of any consumer grade camcorder.  Used properly, the 1080 24P mode looks absolutely incredible -- and by properly, I mean setting the shutter speed to 1/50 second, which gives the video a \"filmic\" look and minimizes the motion artifacts that can appear in 24P video.  I'll note that using the 1/50 second shutter speed will also reduce compression artifacts in recorded video.  For sports videography, the DMC-GH1 also offers a 720 60P mode -- something available on very few camcorders and no digital cameras.-As a video camera, the DMC-GH1 offers the features that will make you enjoy using it as a camcorder.  Specifically, unlike any D-SLR's HD video mode, the DMC-GH1 with the kit lens enables a useful auto focus while you're recording video.  The DMC-GH1 is also the only digital camera that I'm aware of that has a built in stereo microphone, as well as supporting an external stereo microphone.  As an aside, the built in stereo microphone is pretty good for what it is -- recordings I made last weekend of a mariachi band had decent fidelity and good stereo imaging.-Excellent optical image stabilization with the kit lens.  I've successfully taken handheld photos with a 1/15 second shutter speed with the DMC-GH1, and gotten pictures that are free of blurring from camera shake.-The auto focus with the kit lens is quiet.  That may not matter much with most digital cameras, but with the outstanding video quality and stereo sound support of the DMC-GH1, you'll want to make use of it's camcorder functionality, and the quiet auto focus means that you won't get motor noises on the soundtrack of your videos when using the built in stereo microphone.-The ability to play around with depth of field.  The DMC-GH1 has a large enough image sensor that it's possible to work with depth of field in a way that you can't with other camcorders (and with non-D-SLR digital cameras).So what's not to like:-Well, the price.  The DMC-GH1 is the most expensive -- by far -- Micro 4/3 format camera on the market, and it's also way more expensive than entry level D-SLRs such as the Canon Rebels.  But compared with any of those other cameras, the DMC-GH1 comes with a much better kit lens.  It also comes with far superior video recording capability -- other Micro 4/3 cameras are limited to 720 30P video, and while the newest Canon Rebel will do 1080P, it lacks the built in stereo microphone and ability to use the auto focus while recording of the DMC-GH1.-It's smaller than a D-SLR, but it's not small.  Some of the newest Micro 4/3 cameras are signficantly smaller than the DMC-GH1, so if you're looking for something small and don't care about the video capability of the DMC-GH1, you may want to look elsewhere.-It won't win the megapixel wars.  The 12 MP count of the DMC-GH1 matches other Micro 4/3 cameras, but doesn't match up to the latest generation of D-SLRs.  The newest Rebel, for example, is an 18 MP camera -- however, if you use the Rebel with it's kit lens, I doubt you'll ever see that extra resolution, anyway.Bottom line:-If you want a single camera that you can carry with you that will give you great performance as both a digital camera and camcorder, then the DMC-GH1 is for you.  While the DMC-GH1 may be expensive, it is still cheaper than the cost of a nice D-SLR (or Micro 4/3 camera) plus a good HD camcorder. And it will outperform that camcorder, as well.-If you don't care about the video performance of the DMC-GH1, you may want to look elsewhere.  While the DMC-GH1 is a very good digital camera, there are other viable contenders if you exclude the video capability of the DMC-GH1 from your comparisons.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "GH1 is the camera I have been looking for!", "Author": "Ralph \"Ralph\"", "ReviewID": "RB9V8CH415DV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I can say is finally I have found the camera I've always wanted.

The nighttime low light results of the GH1 with the stock lens or the pancake lens make the TM-10 look like a black and white low def camcorder.  I can shoot at 1600 ISO and the results are not grainy!  Plus, the size of the GH1s 1080p AVCHD files is about half of what the equivalent AVCHD files were on the TM-10.  The footage I have taken with the GH1 (as well as the GH1 footage I have seen on Vimeo and Youtube) makes me believe this camera is equivalent to a broadcast quality HD television or movie camera that would cost $10,000 or more.  The camera is easy to use and intuitive.  It is small compared to other DSLRs and is tiny compared to the prosumer camcorders I was considering.  It is really small when you have the pancake lens attached.  It takes amazing still quality photos as well.  I have never owned a DSLR, but this camera blows away the photos I took with my Sony DSC-H10, which is an amazing digital camera with manual shutter/aperture controls, especially in low light without a tripod.  I also looked at the Nikon D90, which also takes great video, but it does not record in AVCHD format, it does not autofocus in movie mode, and I believe there is a pretty small limit on the time of each video scene.

The Tester 13 firmware code opens up new possibilities for independent filmmakers and video artists such as myself. For one, it allows the camera to output in its native 24p frame rate in 1920 x 1080 HD resolution instead of the 60i \"wrapper\" that makes areas of the exposure look like \"mud\". 24p is also the same rate as traditional 35mm movie film, and it's what gives video that \"cinematography look\". The Tester 13 firmware also allowed quite a few other modifications that got independent cinematographers excited. I won't get into them all here, the info is available on the web. If you have heard of the Magic Lantern software for the Canon 5D Mark II, then the Tester 13 software is the equivalent for the GH1.The Tester 13 open source firmware is based on v. 1.32 of the Panasonic firmware. This is the only version that is currently available for download at the Panasonic website. However, around June 2010 Panasonic started shipping units with a new firmware installed, v 1.34. THIS 1.34 FIRMWARE VERSION IS LOCKED AND PANASONIC HAS NOT RELEASED IT TO THE PUBLIC DESPITE NUMEROUS REQUESTS FROM CAMERA OWNERS. There are no extra features in this firmware except the \"feature\" that it prevents any firmware modifications from third party developers.I didn't find out about this until I bought THREE of these units, intending to apply the Tester 13 firmware to achieve the enhanced video output that I wanted. It was only after I was NOT able to do the firmware update that I discovered the bad news buried in the DVXUSER forum that Panasonic has locked the firmware on new GF1 and GH1 cameras and not released the new firmware, in order to prevent third party open source developers from modifying it.Why they would do this seems like a shot in the foot, because there is a great demand among independent filmmakers to use this camera strictly for its movie-making abilities with the Tester 13 \"hack\". Imagine my great disappointment, anger and dismay after buying three of these cameras and then finding out that they all had the \"locked\" firmware. The 24p output was why I bought them and I'm going to have to return them. >:-(I realize this is a good still camera, and a good movie camera for consumers even without the modifications. But the 24p native output of the sensor has been cobbled by Panasonic by forcing the output into a 60i \"wrapper\" which essentially creates what videographers call \"mud\" - crappy, noisy, undefined, compressed, unusable footage. Presumably the only reason they put a lock on is because they are releasing the new GH2 with native 24p in December 2010 and they don't want free the third party \"hack\" competing with their own product. But shame on them for stifling the creativity of their customer base -- I say boycott Panasonic until they unlock this camera or release the 1.34 firmware to the public!!If and when they do unlock it, I will revise my rating.IMPORTANT UPDATE: Tester 13 cracked the firmware on the \"locked\" GH1. This camera is fully hackable now !! I'm upgrading my rating to two stars because it was done in SPITE of Panasonic's efforts to stop it.By the way, the \"hack\" is not all it's \"cracked\" up to be. Yes, it allows much faster bitrates and native 24p, but it does it at the cost of reliablity. The hacked cameras are prone to sudden stopping and loss of data. Worse, the hacked camera doesn't span files, it stops recording after reaching the 4gb file limit (about 15 minutes). I have given up on the GH1 and moved on to the GH2. It does better bitrate and native 24p out of the box.

I could talk endlessly about pros & cons, but they're mostly been covered in other reviews. Instead, here are my top suggestions to any new GH1 user:1) Remove the neck-strap links from the lugs on the camera body. They make noise (bad for video), plus they torque the lugs, which (according to other reviews) has caused some lug failures. You can replace them with small zip-ties, or small finger-loops of 1/8\" paracord (my preference), or use a wrist strap.2) Avoid the \"for dummies\" iA mode, especially if you want to shoot anything indoors. iA mode does OK outdoors in the sun, but indoors, it always chooses too low an ISO, giving you blurry or underexposed photos. Forget it. You can still configure your camera for friends/family to just \"point & shoot\". Just set the dial to \"P\", and set the ISO yourself. 100 for bright outdoors, 800 for natural light indoors, is a good rule of thumb. Also set the White Balance manually, if you want to avoid some post-processing.3) If you want to play with shallow DoF/bokeh, or take great portaits in general, buy a $30 adapter for Canon FD lenses, and buy a Canon FD 50mm/f1.4 lens on ebay for $50-100. Unbelievable value. Or, you could spend 10 times that much for a \"modern\" portrait lens with auto-everything, and hope the camera is smarter than you...good luck. :)4) If you want to shoot indoors without flash, buy the Lumix 20mm/f1.7 pancake lens. The kit lens is simply not fast enough (f4-f5.6) for shooting decent quality indoors photos in most cases.5) If you plan to edit your videos, shoot MJPEG. The ONLY reason I can see to use AVCHD is the consumer-convenience of burning home videos directly to blu-ray. The AVCHD 1080i resolution is not a benefit, when the quality sucks compared to MJPEG 720p. YMMV.----------+4 stars for the shockingly good sensor, kit lens, and EVF; size & weight; build quality; video modes; articulating LCD; ability to use practically any lens you can get your hands on-1 star for the poor iA mode; lack of higher quality video settings without hacking; poorly written manual; minor UI shortcomingsCompared against current Canon and Nikon offerings, this camera should get 6 stars. But I had to complain about something. :)Oh also...if you plan to shoot primarily indoors or other low-light scenes, consider the new GH2 instead. It has a better sensor for low light/high ISO.

Before I got into the \"wife and kids\" phase of my life, I was heavily into 35 mm photography. My current 35mm system is a Nikon 8008 with a full complement of lens that I rarely get out due to its bulk and weight. In line with the phrase, \"the best camera is the one you have with you,\" I finally succumbed to an weatherproof P&S; (point and shoot) that we took along with us for family events, vacations, ect. When this camera died on our last vacation, I decided (actually my wife) to investigate higher end digital cameras.My initial focus was upon a DSLR (digital single lens reflex) to replace my Nikon 8008 (i.e., I could use my old lens). In researching cameras to death (my wife was getting irritated at my single mindedness although she knew this when she married an engineer :), I came upon this interesting four thirds format. Many reviews are out there that explain the details, however, the following points are the ones that had me hooked:- No mirrors (as with DSLRs) means inherently smaller camera size for both the camera body.- The four thirds system offers several distinct advantages in also being able to shoot live video over a DLSR.- Soundless zooming and focusing using a image stabilized interchangeable lens (great for both camera and video applications).- Sensor size is roughly 6 times bigger than a typical P&S; and 22 times bigger than a typical video camcorder.So interestingly, my pursuit of a DSLR resulted in finding a hybrid system that has the best of both worlds - a camera and camcorder in one small package. Now on to the economics of what I eventually decided. I was torn between the Lumix GF1, GH1, and the soon to be released GH2. I was leaning heavily to wait for the GH2 (Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-140mm HD Hybrid Lens (Black)). This camera had a big sensor and the coveted 14-140 lens (roughly equivalent to a DSLR 28-280 lens). I also knew that I wanted the 20 mm, f/1.7 lens (Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras)for shooting in low light conditions. Total cost of planned purchase $1835.However, I was curious about the pricing trends of both the GF1 and GH1 and so I looked them both up on NexTag. As is the case with any new product, being the first in line means you pay top dollar. Buying the old version before the introduction of the new version is a definite bonus for the financially frugal. So, I ended up buying the GF1 with the 20 mm lens (Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 12.1MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Lens) and the GH1 with the 14-140 mm zoom lens (Panasonic DMC-GH1K 12.1MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Video). In so doing, I got two cameras (each with their distinct purpose), two lenses, and two batteries for $1683.Hope this helps you in your decision process. I've been putting both cameras through their paces and have been very impressed with their performance and portability.

This camera is pretty much everything I hoped for. With the single exception that the 1080p HD video is only good in some situations. At recording at 17 mbps it too little information to record lots of quick movements in full detail. Thus in those situations you get some blurring. For what's ever it is worth, I have read rumors that it will be upgraded to 24 or 28 mbps in a future firmware update. So this issue could go away in the future. It still does excellent video in all situations at 720p.  As far as pictures go, the camera is very intuitive as to how to take good pictures with its many presets, but it also give you lots of room to take greater and greater control as your photography knowledge increases. I would highly recommend reading all of the owners manual if you want to get the most out of this camera. And if you are new to the more advanced world of photography, once again after you have had some time to experiment with it. Handling some of my friends DSLR's this camera is indeed much lighter and diminutive, but if you are used to a point and shoot there is certainly some added bulk. If you do also opt to also get the \"Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 A-spherical Pancake Lens\", that tiny yet high quality lens turns the camera into something that you can easily fit in a jacket or cargo shorts pocket. Keep in mind that the camera that just blows point and shoots out of the water in terms of picture and video quality. The pancake lens will also allow you to take better shots and video with low light, especially without a tripod. The kit lens only goes to f/4 in wide and f/5.3 in telephoto. Just the same the kit lens is very capable and better over all for video (basically silent AF(auto focus), and good optical zoom range), but weights more then the camera body. Which should tell you something about how light the camera itself is given its capabilities. The camera and kit lens together weight about 2lbs. Which is at least a third less to anything you will find with a DSLR and similar wide/telephoto lens combination. And the DSLR and lens won't AF while filming 1080p or 720p like this camera and lens combo will.  I bought a scandisk 16gig class 10 card along with the camera and have no problem with buffering in any of the shooting or video situations. Anything slower then a Class 10 and you probably will run into issues if you plan on shooting 1080p video with this camera.A few other quick mentions:  *LCD screen flips out and reverse so you can see it on the lens side too (good for when using the timer function)  *TV play back features for slide shows and videos are good (include the the box is a WVGA cable, but not an HDMI cable)  *Manual said that battery was good for about 320 shots.

Normally I wouldn't write a review for a product that is near the end of its life. However, I think many of the reviews and ratings of this product don't give it fair credit for its accomplishments so I've taken up the task because I am convinced that the DMC-GH1 is the best micro 4/3rds camera yet made in four key respects.1. The DXOMark tests show that the sensor in the GH1 is superior to any other sensor in any other 4/3rds or micro 4/3rds camera currently on the market. When Panasonic announced the GH1, they said that it had a very special (expensive) sensor, and the DXOMark tests show they weren't exaggerating. Although the sensor in the GH1 is smaller than the sensor in the Canon 7D, it is nearly as sensitive. Now that's an amazing accomplishment for which the GH1 should be given full credit.2. The GH1 has the best ergonomics of any 4/3rd or micro 4/3rds camera. It is not the smallest but it has the incredibly useful flip out LCD that lets you easily take pictures and movies from every possible crazy angle which no other camera in its class offers. This simple feature is extremely useful and whenever I switch to another camera that lacks it I sorely miss it. And for those times you don't want to use the articulating LCD, the GH1 has an excellent high resolution electronic view finder (EVF). No other camera in its class has both.3. The GH1 takes the best movies of any 4/3rds or micro 4/3rds camera. It offers the highest temporal (720p60) and spatial (1080p24) resolution, the least aliasing and artefacting, no recording limits, and the most most filmic look. That's beyond dispute. IMO, the movies from the GH1 are better than the movies from any other HDSLR including the Canon 5D/7D (lower measured spatial resolution, horrible aliasing, no autofocus, 12 minute limit), the Samsung NX (horrible rolling shutter), and even the just announced Sony NEX5 (horrible aliasing and line artifacts). The 1080p24 from the GH1 is not perfect, yes it has problems, but its problems are much easier to work around than the horrible aliasing from the other HDSLRs.4. The GH1 comes with an outstanding 14-140mm kit lens, that can silently and continuously autofocus in 1080p movies.So that's four very important areas in which the GH1 is the best in its class by a long shot. As far as I can tell, the GH1 falls short in only two areas: it is slightly larger than the other micro 4/3rds cameras, and not as stylish as some. I'm a big fan of pocketability, but let's be frank, no micro 4/3rds camera will fit in your pants pocket.", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "The future of cameras", "Author": "R. daley", "ReviewID": "R2EBHIBLOBEBFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What makes this camera different is the ability to make both excellent still and video pictures with one (relatively) small camera. My Sony HD video camera is bulky and akward to use and my Canon digital SLR doesn't take movies. Many times I used to go to events (school plays, etc.) with the point-and-shoot just because I wanted both stills and movies and I didn't want to carry a bag o' stuff with me. Therefore, I have been waiting for this camera for a long time.I have been using this camera for a month (including the christmas/new years holidays) and I have been extremely happy with the convenience and quality of this camera. The stills and the videos are both on par with my DSLR and Digital video camera and are far above my point-and-shoot. I take videos in the 720P mode as the 1080 mode seems to have interlace artifacts (even though the sales literature says it is progressive).The big difference between this camera and a digital video camera is that you know longer have to mess around with the tapes. That means that reviewing what you recorded is much easier and less dangerous and transferring to the computer is much easier. A huge win.The big difference between this camera and a DSLR is that you are not looking through a mirror when you look through the viewer. This means that what you see is what you get. Why would ever put a mirror on a digital camera? It's ridiculous.The bottom line is that there is not a DSLR that can do all of the things this camera can do and there is not a video camera that can do all of the things this camera can do.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best hybird in the price point", "Author": "Richard \"The Lion Heart\"", "ReviewID": "R2YQHFEOXRIOGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those who argue that image isn't as good as dslr is mainly due to the kit lens that is definite below average in low light, other than that it shine most other area.The image quality can be excellent as good as DSLR, the camera definite over expose like canon dslr, you might need to adjust a bit or do post processing. the 720p avchd can produce very high quality smooth hd video that easily beat quality of those hd program. is about 14-15mb bit rate show in ps3.I original interest going for Canon 7d, but try it and felt is way too heavy for me and i am worry if drop damage might much greater. gh1 body itself isn't that cost compare to 7d.  since the lens aleady sold for $850 My friend has t1i, he was suprise that my camera outperform him in many situation not just video but image too. his camera produce far more noise pictures and video.

I bought a cheap $30 lens adapter now I can use all kinds of great and cheap old Canon FD lenses, which even their new EF cameras cant use.-Because of its shallow flange depth can be use just about any other camera's lenses as long as you can find an adapter.-I rented a PL adapter to use it with a set of $10k Zeiss ultra prime lenses for a film.

Well, I lied. I started getting into video more, so I wanted a camera with full manual control and 24P at an affordable price. That narrowed it down to a 7D, T2i, or GH1. I chose the GH1 mainly due to lens compatability and size. My feelings towards the camera were a bit cold at first. I knew that it was loaded with features, but I guess the E-P1's aesthetics (and my G11) just felt \"warmer\" when using it. The GH1 is a bit more industrial, but now that I'm used to it, it really doesn't matter much.The main feature that separates the GH1 from many cameras, not just m43, is the high-bitrate 1080P video (after hacking). I won't get into technicalities, but I will say that most of my footage has been nothing short of amazing. I shot a little movie on backyard bugs (lame, I know) for a couple of days after receiving the camera and the footage really does look like something from National Geographic or Discovery Channel. The only gripes I have about the video is the banding at ISO's past 800. If not properly exposed, the footage is borderline unusable for full-screen viewing. It's not too bad for small-screen web viewing, but if I'm doing something presentable, 500 is probably my limit.Pictures from the GH1 are pretty nice too, but the JPEGs aren't as good as the PENs. If you're not feeling too inspired to edit each and every photo, and you simply want a great out-of-the-box JPEG machine with nice skin-tones and colors, get a PEN. You definitely will not be dissapointed. I've made prints from both the GH1 and the E-P1, and I can honestly say that prints from the E-P1 look better; to my eyes at least. However, it's a moot point if you're shooting RAW. The GH1 has better ISO sensitivity (worse banding control, however), and I wouldn't mind pushing a photo to 1600 or even 2000 since I have Dfine and can easily clean up most of the noise and banding seen at higher ISOs.While the GH1 is bigger, uglier (IMO), and less portable than the PENs, it makes up for it with better ergnomics, a swivel LCD, and a nice and bright EVF. The PEN looks better than the GH1 when displaying the two bodies next to each other, but the GH1 feels better in the hand after getting used to the aesthetics. Although the GH1 isn't substantially larger than the E-P1, the extra protrusions from the viewfinder, and grip may make it less portable for some who value size over function. It's definitely not as large as my old E-620 or E-510, but it is large enough that I'll consider leaving it at home or in the car if I don't have my messenger bag on me.Overall, I have to say that I really like the GH-1. Video is amazing, pictures are great, and as of now it's probably the best all-around camera in the m43 range. I  can't find a reason to glance at the GH2 unless if Panasonic somehow increases the AVCHD bitrates to 35-40MBps and improve FPN.If you're looking for high quality videos at an affordable price, it's hard not to recommend the GH1. If you don't care too much about 1080/24P video and can settle with 720/30P with great JPEGs, then I recommend the E-PL1 or E-P2 (E-P1 has no manual controls for video to stop strobing at high shutter speeds). In the end, I say 4.5 stars, but I'll give it 5 because of Amazon's star rating-system.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fun with the GH1", "Author": "C.

Every time I use it, I like it even more also.  If you are looking for a camera that take nice pictures and do great video, the Panasonic Lumix GH1 is a great choice.I purchased this camera to shoot videos in 1080P, but for the first day with the camera, I couldn't stop taking pictures because I was having so much fun with it.  Some of the first footage I shoot with the GH1 was of my niece playing in her crib in a low light setting.  I didn't use any special setting because I didn't want to miss the moment.  I just point a shot the footage and I still like the footage.I can't wait to do a big project with this camera with the proper lighting.  I'm very excited!!!", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Meets My Needs Better Than Any Camera I've Ever Owned", "Author": "Steven M. Frankel", "ReviewID": "R32XDIJOWTODVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As someone who has been involved with every aspect of still photography for more than 50 years, and has never gone a year without buying at least one camera, I've got to say the Lumix GH-1 is the best one I've ever used for the purposes important to me. Nearly all of the photos I take are either travel shots from the 2 international cruises we take each year (this year being a cruise along the Norwegian and Scottish coasts, and rounding Cape Horn from Santiago to Buenos Aires) or  yacht racing photos taken from a pitching race committee boat. To meet these needs, I need a camera that can:* Go from super-telephoto to wide angle in seconds (picture an 80' yacht bearing down on the committee boat at 20 knots or more at the start of a race, and only veering off when it's 5 feet away);* Produce high-quality 13\"x19\" enlargements suitable for framing (which in my environments usually requires effective \"anti-shake\" along with a sharp lens);* Have an \"old fashioned\" viewfinder that's effective in bright sunlight on the ocean;* Be comfortably carried, along with the main lenses you need, on a camera or wrist strap with extra lenses in your jacket pockets, on a 6-8 hour tour with lots of walking and both indoor and outdoor shooting opportunities; and* Be replaced if it's stolen or damaged without mortgaging my house.My 2008 attempt to meet these ideas was a Sony Alpha 350 with a Tamron 28-300 mm lens and a Sony f1.8 50mm lens.  It met all of the requirements except for the comfortable carry.  The camera with the Tamron super zoom was just too heavy and bulky to carry all day  -- especially in tropical settings.  My 2009 attempt was the Panasonic Lumix G-1 with the 14-45mm & 45-200mm kit lenses, and the Lumix 20mm f1.7 lens for indoor work.  This combo was much more comfortable than the Alpha outfit to carry on a walking tour but required switching lenses to go from wide angle to long telephoto -- a impossibility for many of the photo opportunities I seek.For 2010 I wanted to better satisfy these same requirements, but also begin to explore video photography in these same settings.  I selected the Lumix GH-1 with the 14-140 lens (the 35mm equivalent of 28-280mm) and high-definition video capabilities, plus the Lumix 20mm f1.7 lens I already own.  After using this combo over the Memorial Day weekend, I can honestly say it meets my needs better than any camera I've ever owned.  The GH-1 with the 14-140 zoom is compact and  weighs less than 2 pounds, and the 20mm f1.7 \"pancake\" lens weighs only a few ounces and can even fit in a trouser or shirt pocket.  Further, the photos are as sharp as any camera I've used that's even remotely portable and affordable, regardless of which lens I use.I have to admit that my first attempts at shooting videos were a fiasco, but I know that I'll learn the skills to do this within the next year or so.  And in the meantime I'm enjoying the GH-1 which at $1180 at Amazon was about half their cost of a G2 and the 14-140 lens; has video capabilities that are better than the G1's and most hernia-inducing Canons and Nikons with similar zooms selling for 3-4 times the cost; and can fit in a corner of my carry-on bag.  Sure I'd like full-frame capabilities in a 2-pound package with a similar zoom, as well as even better low-light capabilities, but I figure this is likely to be several years away.", "Date": "June 2,

I have shot everything from portraits in a studio, street shooting, sporting events, and family functions.  The camera has never let me down and considerint it is 3 year old technology that is a true rarity.  In addition there are 3rd party firmware hacks that further improve the video and still image capabilities making superior in my opinion to many current compact system cameras.  Out of the box the kit lens Panasonic 14-140mm f/4.0-5.8 OIS Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic Digital SLR Cameras has decent capabilities limited mostly by low light performance.  The battery hold a charge and allows for easy sessions of 400+ shutter fires, closer to 300 Panasonic DMW-BLB13 Battery for G10K, G1K, G2K, GF1, GF1C, GF1K, GH1K Panasonic Micro Four Thirds Cameras (Retail Packaging)if flash is used regularly.  The IQ is great surpassing many of the DSLRs that I have used and the size is so convenient when you don't want to stick out like a sore thumb.  That being said the format of the camera is still respectable enough that in professional settings your client or subject will comply accordingly.The meat of the camera revolves around the Micro four thirds mirrorless format, while 3 years ago the offerings were limitedalong the lines of both camera bodies and especially lens this has all changed recently.  The lens offerings are more than sufficient from pancake style wide angle with fast glass to primes with amazing color rendition and sharp capturing, to the ubiquitous zoom lens offering the reach out and touch them abilities of the larger DSLR offerings but let me remind you that this camera format allows you to have lenses easilly 20-30% smaller and lighter with the same zoom capabilities.  The 14-140mm lens (28-280mm equivelent in 35mm) is the size of a soda pop can.  In 35mm form it would easilly be the size of a large water bottle and probably 3/4\" wider.  I could go on extensively with regard to carry ability and M4/3 size advantage the reality is it still has to take great pictures.I was new to digital when I picked this up, had gone through 3-6 point and shoot cameras and always been dissappointed in the shutter lag slow aperature and horrible low light performance.  But the thought of hauling around 10+ pounds of gear for every function was off putting, enter the Lumix G series.  The shutter lag is next to nil, and the performance otherwise is as good as your glass or lens.  My 25mm f/1.4 Leica DG Summilux Aspherical Micro 4/3 Lens and Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 45mm f/1.8 Lens for Micro Four Thirds Cameras are as fast and certainly as crisp as any glass I've ever used even in film days, and the equivelant 35mm legnth 50mm and 90mm make them the ideal prime lens.  I have blown up to 11x 14\" with no pixelation at all and even to poster size prints with amazing clarity.  The ISO is on the average to lower side now with a reality of ISO800 being the limit for most shots before becoming grainy.  The ability for long exposures 60 sec. allows for nice composition of night shots.  The ease of the menu navigation and simple function buttons makes it a breeze to adjust to the changes of the environment and/or the changes to the image composition you are looking for.  Simple gadgets included are film modes (with a designated easy to find button) from black and white to vivid color or various degrees of smooth or high contrast settings.  The iA is also quite forgiving and in my wifes hand (who has no interest in the art of photography but rather capturing the moments as they happen and producing appealing pictures) has made some postcard quality shots and continues to impress her with how easy and fun it can be.  There are various priority modes from \"aperature\" \"shutter\" \"custom\" \"iA\" \"macro\" \"night\" all of which have nice sub menus to cater to the situation.  For those like myself that wanted to take my photography further, the control is limitless with what you can manually adjust as well allowing me to really improve my pictures and my abilities as well as learning the digital photography art more thoroghly.The video capability is way beyond mine, I have produced some effortless clips and stunning short legnth videos, but my knowledge is less than enough to accurately review its ability other than it made me look like I kneew what I was doing with the simple push of the designated video button, and easy editing on my Apple MacBook Pro MD313LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)  It is fast accurate bright and simple to produce great video in my opinion and with the firmware hack mentioned earlier this body is condidered by many to be a professional grade portable system.I'll cut this off with some bullet points:+size+battery life+image capture speed+availability of lens for all situations+ease of use+ability to maually control the camera and produce stunning images+HD video ability beyond almost all other system cameras+SD card compatibility+iA mode will make 99% of the users feel like they can take pictures with confidence+RAW and jpeg file capture for post processing and easy sharing of file in high resolution-lens expense-no in camera image stabilization (panasonic lens has IS where needed)-low light performance with kit lens 14-140mm and 14-45/42mm (overcome by additional lens purchase)-single card slot for those busier daysI highly recomend this camera still 3 years later, and for the novice or the experienced this camera will not dissappoint, being 3 years old now it is much less expensive and the lens offerings make it an even better camera than it was the day I bought it.  I recomend these lens:Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras this is the smallest most accurate lensPanasonic Lumix 14mm f/2.5 G Aspherical Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras smallest WA lens25mm f/1.4 Leica DG Summilux Aspherical Micro 4/3 Lens my favorite all around lens used 99% of my days great for all lighting situations down to darkOlympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 45mm f/1.8 Lens for Micro Four Thirds Cameras nice medium legnth prime lens with superior image qualitiesOlympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 12mm f/2.0 Lens for Micro Four Thirds Camerasgreat wide angle lens with tac sharp capture out to the edges of the image when stepped down one to two notches, and a sufficient macro shooter as well with fast aperature for such a compact size.All of these lens are still being covetted by m4/3 shooters as well so as you develop your skill or down the line decide to expand your body the lens will be with you for years or generations to come.  Many feel m4/3 and four thirds in general is a valid format to start taking market shares, like 35mm was back in the day when everybody laughed, this was the camera that really validated the format with both amazing still images and industry standard level video capture.-", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you liked film SLR's, you'll like this", "Author": "M. whitton", "ReviewID": "R2A4FF2AGHRI20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I held off buying a DSLR for years due to the size, cost, and complications.

I compared ISO1600 shots with my 4 year old Nikon D40, and the Nikon retains visibly more detail.

I own full frame Canon and the images are stunning but the body and lenses fill a large backpack and weigh a lot.  For an easy walking around camera I have a Canon G10 which fits in my pocket but is limited to one lens and the images, though surprisingly good in the right circumstances, are not comparable to the big camera.  The G10 is almost useless for shooting children or moving subjects.  The Lumix GH1 was designed to fit in between both functionally and in terms of size, and offer a good movie option as well.It is bigger than a point and shoot but still smaller and lighter than any regular dslr.  Easy to carry with a strap over the shoulder or in a small backpack.  The kit lens is very good and combined with an equally good 7-14 zoom offers a range from extreme wide angle to long telephoto, way beyond the capability of any point and shoot.  It focuses fast and reliably, especially when shooting children with face detection.  The stills are better than a point and shoot but not quite as good as a full frame dslr.  The colors are deeper and richer than a point and shoot but the color balance is not quite as stunning as the big Canon.  Grain and detail are very well controlled up to 800 ISO.  The movies are good quality and the sound is captured well both close and far.But there are compromises.  The size is achieved by eliminating the mirror and pentaprism of a dslr using a live electronic image instead.  This is generally useful for framing but not for detailed review of the shot beforehand.  For example, the effect of a polarizer cannot be seen through the viewfinder.  Precise manual focus is difficult or not possible.It is also difficult to shoot more than one shot quickly.  Each shot is frozen in the viewfinder for a few seconds before it returns to live view and another shot can be taken.  So the GH1 shoots one shot quicker than a point and shoot but does not allow a fast series of shots like a dslr.  This is a real limitation when shooting children or sports.The biggest challenge I have found is the color.  Canon has generally gotten color right.  Panasonic has a slightly different balance and though generally very good the prints just don't grab like the big Canon's do.  I suspect that it is partly due to the smaller sensor.  Getting the color right will likely improve with experience.  It is also easy to inadvertently hit the color balance button on the back of the camera.  Fortunately the menu is obvious in the viewfinder but you need to learn to pay attention because it disappears as soon as the shutter button is pressed.So, this is now my main travel camera, what I use to photograph my grandson when the big camera is too big to haul around, and my new movie camera.  It is well designed and generally keeps the compromises to a minimum.  Face detection and an articulating screen are a real plus.

Low light, daylight, all iso settings, it was there, and it seems others have had it too.  Not trying to be negative, I even tried to, as some suggested, \"burn it in\", but it did not go away.  Just make sure to look closely on a big monitor.  Being a professional DP, it was a big disappointment.There was a lot to like, manual control, 3rd party features, depth of field, etc.  But there is no way to overcome a bad sensor.  I do like the Panasonic TM700, and for me it shoots great video at 1080P 60 frames per second, which has a lot of options for playback speed.  Panasonic makes some great stuff, maybe the next model will do better.  It also seems some people don't have this problem, so I guess it's a bit of a crap shoot.  I don't know, I can only speak and pass on my experience.I also found the stills quality lacking, outside of the sensor lines issue which was in stills mode also.  I do a lot of timelapse work, and even the Canon Rebel XS at $400 some dollars, is in my opinion is a far superior stills camera.  I wish I could have said how great it is, again, I had very high hopes, but for me it was a waste of time and effort.  I like and use other Panasonic products professionally (again I own two Panasonic TM700 cameras), just not this model.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beware Lumix Cameras from Angel Seller", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R328O6VZQVGINV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a Panasonic Lumix GH1K from Amazon through Angel Seller last May. I live in California and Angel Seller is in Brooklyn, NY. The camera with the 14 to 140mm zoom lens cost over $1370. It was my first experience with an HD capable camera. Its User Manual is almost 200 pages long, so there is a steep learning curve. The HD video seemed to record fine when viewed from the camera's LCD screen. I did not have time to edit my work for several months.Last month I attempted to create a DVD using Final Cut Pro & DVD Studio Pro software. DVD Studio Pro balked because the files were PAL rather than NTSC (American standard.) I called Panasonic Tech support and ascertained that I had been sold the European version of the Lumix GHI. Moreover, the HD records at 25P and 50P rather than 30P and 60P (the codecs used on this side of the Atlantic.) My HD movies had frame drops and other miscues as a result. The Panasonic Techs informed me the issue was built into the camera and could not be fixed with software or firmware.I then found that there was no way to contact Angel Seller directly (no phone number or address) except through a message from my Amazon account. Using the Amazon account, I questioned why they had sold me a European camera when I live in California, and asked if they could exchange it for the American version. There only response was through Amazon and is quoted in full: \"We're sorry. More than 90 days have passed since you placed this order from Angel Seller.\"The Lumix GH1 is a well designed, excellent camera, but mine is worthless for video purposes in the USA. HD video really is the reason why I bought this camera. I already have an excellent Nikon D40x for still photography. I feel blind-sided and really burned, and I question Angel Seller's integrity in the matter. How do they get off selling PAL cameras to NTSC customers? I would have rated them with zero stars if that was possible.Watch out if you do business with this dealer. They obviously do not want to hear back from their customers. It will cost me dearly to replace this GH1.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lens moves around red spot when zoming  Any comments?", "Author": "whzuser384tq", "ReviewID": "R2G0VM4RRNM0IN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a new GH1 with 10x 14-140 zoom.

Janca", "ReviewID": "RXI1HB5NCNYQ2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, I will be fair to the GH1 camera.  Coming from a 1DSMKIII and 5D, the little GH1 was easy to get used to design-wise, and I felt the quality of the pictures were very good at lower ISOs.  The kit lens actually looks sharper at wider focal lengths then my Canon 24-70 2.8 L, though the tele side is pretty soft.  You can carry this thing around and not even feel it.  But it is not built like a professional camera, even a semi-pro one.  I've owned mine for 1 day shy of two weeks and already the i-bolt (don't know the real name) that is physically attached to cameras side where the camera strap is supposed to connect to popped off.  This is a major problem as it happened while the camera was around my neck.  Luckily I felt the camera slip and was able to catch it before it fell.  Others might be less fortunate if this problem turns out to be a design or manufacturing defect because in addition to the potential for the camera to drop off your neck at any moment, the connector that attaches to the i-bolt inside the camera is now off floating around inside the body somewhere... if its metal and it connects  with a circuit board this could get ugly.I hope this does not happen to anyone else.**Update**As of Nov. 2nd I have received a full-refund for this problem, though it took a lot longer than it should have.

I really like the size, the range of the lens, the versatility of the video, etc., but when it came right down to it, the image quality and performance of the camera/lens combo for still images was pretty bad, especialy indoors.  First, the lens is quite slow.  Combine this with a very weak flash, and you have a lot of trouble getting a properly exposed picture indoors.  Wehn you use auto ISO, the camera stubbornly keeps the ISO at 100.  The camera always selects a slow shutter speed (1/30 or 1/40) instead of upping the ISO.  If you are content to use all manual settings, it is posible to get a well-exposed indoor shot, but with the auto modes, forget about it.  Outdoors the image quality is pretty good, but nowhere near the quality from a standard sized DSLR like a D90.So after using the camera for a couple weeks, I sold it.  Even thought the D90 is considerably bigger, the small size of the GH1 is not worth the trade-offs to me.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not very intelligent", "Author": "Corey J. jones", "ReviewID": "R23IPVBX3V7TGZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just wanted a really good camera so I could take pictures but my family could use it in auto and take great pictures as well.
