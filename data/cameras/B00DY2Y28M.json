{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lots of Zoom!  Low Noise!  So far I am happy!", "Author": "Rolla Gravett \"Rolla Gravett\"", "ReviewID": "R34T7F8KZDA8HW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The is going to be a quick review on the camera and I will add more as time goes on.  The FZ70 takes really good sharp photos, but hand held might be a problem in lower light levels.  I went out yesterday evening and took some shots hand held and they all came out blurry.  I should have paid more attention to the shutter speed.The camera works fantastically in iA, which is the auto mode. I mainly use Aperture but was impressed with the auto settings.It will go with a 60 second exposure in the Starry Sky Mode, which is under the SCN mode on the main dial.The lens thread is 55mm so if you plan on using your filters from any other Pany camera, you will need a 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.  Amazon has them for cheap.  I don't think vignetting will be a problem using 52mm filters as the lens is way smaller than the filter threads on the camera.  Here is the 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.Goja 55-52mm Step-Down Adapter Ring (55mm Lens to 52mm Accessory) + Bonus Ultra Fine Microfiber Lens Cleaning ClothThe camera has no shutter remote cord jack, so a shutter release cable will not work.  My Yongnuo YN-560 flash will not work on the camera either.  It physically hits the camera flash housing, which is raised a little.  The answer to that is to use a wireless flash trigger with the Yongnuo Flash and that works fine.Addition:  I looked at the Yongnuo flash again and it will fit on the camera, but it is a tight fit between the camera flash and the Yongnuo flash housing.  I modified the Yongnuo flash by taking some of the plastic off the flash housing where the camera flash is hitting, with a pencil grinder.  It doesn't take much, and it is right in the middle of the housing.  You could remove some of the plastic in the flash housing with sandpaper, but it would take longer, but will also give you more control of how much plastic you are taking off.  Now my Yongnuo Flash works perfectly on the FZ70 camera!The video does not have a progressive setting.  Interpolated is the best you are going to get with this camera.The FZ70 does not have a jack for a shutter release cable and does not have an infrared input either.  The camera has to be set to a timer delay within the camera for 2 or 10 seconds.  If it was a Sony or Canon, the timer is set and stays on till you shut it off.  Unfortunately this camera requires you set the timer delay for each and every photo.The longest the camera will go on exposure under the Shutter or Manual Mode is 8 seconds.  In the Starry Sky Mode it will go 15, 30, and 60 seconds.Like I said the lens thread is 55mm so your filters will have to be that size or use an adapter.  The camera will use a teleconverter with the DMW-LA8 adapter, which is not available yet.  Addition:  Those LA8 adapters are available on Ebay now.  They are being sold out of Japan though.  I had that happen with the FZ200 camera as well and had no problem getting one from a Japanese Ebay member.  There are several teleconverters that work well with this camera, but may not be needed as this lens rocks as far as zoom goes!It will take Raw pictures, but no one is supporting the FZ70 Raw files yet.  It will come.  Added: I found that FastStone will support the Raw files from the FZ70 and it is much better than Silkypix, in my opinion.  Just Google FastStone and download and install the software.  It is free.Start up time is very fast.  I was able to take a picture in one second after turning the camera on.The focus button is on the top of the camera now.  The AF/MF/Macro button is on the right side of the LCD instead of on the camera lens.One thing I have noticed with this camera is the noise, or should I say the lack of noise!  The shots I took at ISO 800 and ISO 1600 still look pretty good, and at ISO 100 noise is hard to find.The camera will zoom to 60X (1200mm 35mm Equivalent) in the 16mp picture size.  Setting the picture size to 10mp will give you 75X zoom, setting the size to 7mp will give you 90X, at 5mp you get 108X and at 3mp is 135X.  This is Extended Optical Zoom.  If you need more zoom than that, under IResolution, use I-Zoom for an additional 2X at all picture sizes and digital will give another 2X, but image quality will suffer. I took some shots at the 10mp picture size with I-Zoom on, and the photos in my photo software are showing 3030mm zoom and they look amazingly good! I will post a link to some shots in the first comment on the review.There are two FN buttons on the camera that can be set the way you want them to be.  I set FN 1 button to Bracketing and FN 2 button to Flash Control.  I may change them as time goes on, but I find it really great to be able to get Bracketing with the push of a button.I don't care much for the lens cap, and ordered a better 55mm one on Amazon.eForCity 55mm Camera Lens Cap, BlackHoya makes good filters and I found this one (55mm) that will work fine on this camera.  I use filters as it seems more often than not, I end up with my fingerprints on the lens filter.  It also keeps dirt and grime from getting to the lens.  It might offer some protection in an accident too.Hoya 55mm HMC UV Digital Multi-Coated Slim Frame Glass FilterThe camera does not come with a lens hood and none is available in the Accessories on the Panasonic web site either.  It seems there is no lens hood for this camera at this time.This is it for now.  I will add to this review as time goes by, so check back often.Addition:I had a chance to check out the high speed picture mode with the camera and found this:  At 2 fps (frames per second) all works as advertised and it takes 2 fps for an extended period of time. 5 fps - it takes 5 frames per second for 3 shots and goes back to the 2 fps rate.  I tried it in Auto Focus mode and the regular mode with the same results.  9 fps - Once again, 3 shots and then the 2 fps rate.  H Mode - the camera took a very fast rate of speed (at least 9 frames per second) for 9 shots, or 1 second.  I have since found in the manual that at that speed the picture size is 2.5 or 3 mp.  I forgot which.  That is excellent.  The last mode is the Flash and it will take 5 quick photos with flash before stopping.  That could come in very handy at times.I really like this camera.  I like the menu system on the Panasonic Cameras too.  I have the Canon SX50 as well, and still have problems with the menu settings and I have had that camera for 6 months.  The menu system just doesn't make sense to me on that camera.I did a shootout with the Canon SX50, the Pany FZ200, the FZ70, and a Sony Nex 6.  The FZ70 images look about the same as the Canon SX50, and in my mind better than the Pany FZ200 camera.  The last shot is a Raw shot from the FZ70 camera converted to JPG.  The picture files can be seen in the Comments on page 12, the 7th post.Added:  After using this camera for a while now,  I am even more impressed with it.  It takes great pictures and I really like the Panasonic Menu, which is laid out well and easy to use.  I am getting lots of keeper photos and the lack of noise in the shots is really appreciated!Addition 10-29-13  I sent the first FZ70 back because the photos at high zoom were soft.  To make a long story short, it turned out that the Hoya UV filter I was using on the camera was responsible for the soft photos.  I have changed to a Sigma DG 55mm filter and the results are outstanding.  Sharp clear photos at all zoom levels.  This camera takes photos every bit as sharp and detailed as the Panasonic FZ150 or FZ200 camera and is as good as the Canon SX50 in sharpness as well.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera is state of the art  \"overall\" , in terms of price, versatility & quality", "Author": "David Marks \"norcalidave\"", "ReviewID": "R240E02RB7PGQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update on December 10, 2013:  After having used this camera for an extended period of time, I like it even more!  And the price is ridiculously low right now, I notice. Here's a great recent review of the FZ70 by Adorama Camera :[...]__________________My prior review(s):First of all, I am an Amazon customer and this camera was purchased for me, by another Amazon customer (my fiancee), so it IS an \"Amazon verified purchase\".I've had the FZ70 for two days and I've taken quite a few pictures with it, but I will update this review once I've tried more of its many features. I've also followed and taken part in the users' comments section on Amazon, regarding this camera, and I respect the opinions of all the other 19 reviewers, even though I disagree with some of them.In my opinion, if you have less than $600 to spend and you want only one bridge camera, then I believe this FZ70 is made for you. I've read all the comments about comparisons of this model with the Panasonic 150 and Panasonic 200, and I have no doubt that if you're using your digital camera primarily for printing large photos of birds, taken with a long telephoto, then the FZ200 should perhaps be your choice.But for the rest of us, this FZ70 is an extraordinary camera, even though its long-telephoto lens speed is less than that of the FZ150 or 200. The FZ200, however, costs $150 more than the FZ70, and it has its own weaknesses. As I say in my title to this review,  if you look at the overall picture, including the price of the camera, its telephoto and wide angle lens capabilities, its feature set, its ease of use, it's fast and accurate focusing, etc., then I think this FZ70 represents the current \"state of the art\" in affordable bridge cameras.So why do I say this is an extraordinary camera and that if I ONLY could have one \"under $600 bridge camera\", this FZ70 would be my choice?  I say this for many reasons, but one of the first things about this camera that blew me away, was its 20 mm WIDE lens capability. I took some landscape photos yesterday of grassland/oak woodlands up here in the lower Sierra, looking down toward the Sacramento Valley,  at the widest lens possible (20 mm), and when I looked at the photos on my iMac 24 inch monitor, I was astounded by the way the photos looked, and at first I didn't realize why they were so different and so impressive.They were different and impressive because no other bridge camera (at least that I know of) has this optical lens RANGE,  and the 20 mm wide angle photos I took yesterday, made it abundantly clear why it isn't just the LONG TELE shots that are important, it's also equally the WIDE angle lens capabilities that are so valuable. One of the reasons I was so impacted by the 20 mm photos I took, is that human peripheral vision is limited, and we use our central vision most of the time. But when we're LOOKING at a beautiful photo taken with (for instance) this camera's wide-angle lens, we're using our central vision to view the photo. Again, when we view such a photo (on screen or otherwise) taken with a wide-angle lens, we don't have to use our peripheral vision. So in a sense, we're actually \"seeing\" more of the landscape scene than we see when we're standing at the edge of the scene, \"seeing it in real time\".  Call it magic, or call it what you want, but it sure feels like magic...In other words, a good camera with a 20 mm wide-angle lens capability, lets us \"virtually\" see more than our own visual system normally sees (when we're out looking at the 'real' landscape). In a sense, I suppose it's fair to say that this FZ70, with its super-wide lens, is a \"virtual reality\" machine...smile....Also, I have tested this camera at longer telephoto settings and I haven't had any trouble with sharpness, but I understand that the FZ150 and FZ200 (both of which I believe have an f2.8 lens speed all the way through the telephoto range) would probably provide a birder with sharper images of birds, at longer distances, especially in lower light situations. The FZ70's compromise (given all its other amazing features) is that its lens range is F2.8-F5.9, so at the longest telephoto end of its range, the amount of light collected with the FZ200 is two to three times as much as it is with the FZ70. With normal lighting conditions, the lesser light-gathering power of the FZ70 at longer telephoto settings may not make much difference, but for birders who are taking photos of birds from far away, in lower light conditions, then of course the FZ70 will likely not take as sharp a photo(s) as the FZ150 or 200.Also, as Rolla Gravett has said many times, the FZ200 is NOISY!  I think the reason it's noisy, is that it has such a fast tele lens, that with all that light it gathers with an image, it also \"gathers\" noise. Of course it's up to the JPEG design, to reduce much of that noise, but it's not easy to do at these price levels. When you design a lens with a low F-stop at all magnifications, you get more sharpness in low light, but you also get more noise (in a sense, the extra \"light\" becomes extra \"noise\").I'll post a few of the pictures that I just took with the FZ70, including one of a real estate sign, taken from 100 yards away, and you'll see just how sharp this camera can be! I couldn't even tell it was a real estate sign from where I stood, but the photo I took is extremely sharp and clear.And did I say that all my photos so far have been taken with the Intelligent Auto (iA) setting on the mode dial?  I haven't even tried the manual settings yet, or the full HD video capability, etc.  Which reminds me, I think some of the negative comments about the FZ70, in terms of sharpness, may just have been due to an erroneous setting on the mode dial.The setting most people will usually use is the iA setting and it is rather inconspicuous in size at least, on the mode dial/wheel. It is the only setting that's in \"red\" but it's also very small, plus there's a different mode labeled \"A\", which some of you may confuse with \"full auto\" mode.  If you do confuse the two and aren't taking photos with the iA/intelligent Auto setting, you are definitely liable to get inferior pictures...Did I also say that the auto focus on this camera is FAST and accurate?  Well, it's \"VERY fast, and accurate\"...----------And a brief addition to the above comments:  If you have (or ever get) cataracts, and/or you're over 50 years or so in age, you will observe that it takes more light to read, and to make images \"sharp\". This is pretty much what happens with a  telephoto lens, at its longest extension, unless (like the FZ150 and 200) the lens speed is maintained at those longest magnifications.  The FZ70, as I say above. is a \"slower\" lens at its greater magnification, while the FZ200 maintains (or at least it is supposed to) an F2.8 setting even at the longer telephoto magnifications. And just like the aging human eye, if you don't have access to more light, the images you see won't be as sharp. This doesn't mean the FZ70 isn't a great camera, but it does mean if you're used to a more expensive camera (such as the Panasonic FZ200), it will be more difficult for you to adjust to and accept the FZ70's \"sharpness\" level, at least in lower light situations when you're using the maximum telephoto setting. Again, if I had the money I would also buy an FZ200.  But the FZ200 itself has limitations that the FZ70 does not have, thus I'm satisfied (and then some) with the FZ70 as my camera.As for Rolla Gravett's latest comments about his four image shootout, I have to respectfully disagree with him, regarding the results. I saved all the originals and compared them side-by-side on my 24 inch monitor, and I found the FZ70 original image to be almost identical to the Canon's. I could not see any significant difference, and so I asked my fiancee to compare all the images (I of course didn't tell her which was which).  She couldn't see any difference either, at least not between the FZ70 regular image and the Canon's. But we both agreed that the Sony shot was inferior, and I thought the FZ200 image wasn't anything special, (that surprised me, but it probably shouldn't have, since the FZ200's forte is long telephoto/low light photos).  Also, the FZ70 RAW image that was reverted back to a JPEG, wasn't as good as either the Canon or the original FZ70 JPEG. And by the way, I think Amazon compresses our digital photo \"size\", even though they imply they don't.  My shots today were all around 6 megapixels in size, but on Amazon they certainly aren't that quality.--------------------------Update: September 25, 2013:  I am even more impressed now with this camera and its IQ (image quality) and its features. Here's a comment I just made about another reviewer's post:  \"Also, I just figured out something that really improves the focus on my shots, and it shows why you have to READ the manual and try the many features that this camera offers. I had been shooting a japanese maple tree from about 8 feet away, and my shots just weren't as sharply focused as I wanted. Then I realized I could press the focus button (top right of the camera) even in iA mode, and use a smaller focusing square to focus JUST where I wanted, as far as the thousands of leaves on this small tree. When I did that, I got something crazy, like noticeably sharper photos...it was hard to believe...You can't just \"point and shoot\" with this camera, even in iA mode sometimes. This is why some people have complained about the IQ of their results with the FZ70. But it is NOT the camera's fault, and the more I use this camera and the more I read the CD manual, the more I love it. Again, this is not simply a \"point and shoot\" camera, although much of the time you get excellent results just using the iA Mode (and altering nothing else). But you can get fantastic, and often sharper photos if you experiment with one or more of the details you can change on this camera, and the way you set up the focus for a photo is one of the most important variables. I've just started to scratch the surface, and I'm finding that the more I learn about how to use it, the better my results are...\"______________ Update as of September 29, 2013:  CameraLabs has just published a very thorough review of the FZ70 and they seemed to really like the camera. Here's one of the summary comments by the CameraLabs reviewer: \"By significantly extending the range at both ends, Panasonic has produced a super-zoom truly worth of the name and of Cameralabs' Recommended award.\"  And here's the site that has the review:  cameralabs.com/reviews/Panasonic_Lumix_DMC_FZ70_FZ72/By the way, the above CameraLabs reviewer says he would have given it a perfect score, except for the fact that it doesn't include WiFi and GPS.  I personally don't need either one in my digital camera, but if you do need either, this might influence your decision.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't rush to judgement!  .. Update!", "Author": "S. Hock \"slhimages\"", "ReviewID": "R1T1PS8QD7NYJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had mine a few days so my testing is admittedly limited. Please do not give up on this camera unless you have made some very careful tripod shots. Yes, this camera is hard to hold steady as is any 300+ mm lens. The stabilizer is good but cannot overcome everything. Hand holding 1200mm is a tough job and requires excellent technique and a degree of luck!I used a heavy Bogen tripod on solid cement and made very careful shots at about 50yds and 75yds (auto focus) throughout the available f range at max zoom. I was quite surprised at the resolving power of the lens using ISO 100.My Nikon D5000 and Nikkor 70 - 300 EDIF zoom in RAW mode, on the same subject, is barely sharper.Laugh if you will, but I used the SilkyPix software to examine the RAW and jpeg images. I did not find a difference even worth mentioning in raw and jpeg modes. I did not use the default picture settings in the camera. SilkyPix works just fine if you take a bit of time to learn to use it. I also own PhotoShop and have used it for over 20 years, so it's not like I didn't have a choice.All images benefited from a bit of post processing just as all my D5000 and P7700 images do.I can see how some users might easily rush to judgement on this camera. But it shouldn't be about lens sharpness. Hold it steady and it will deliver very good results. Many of the review sites have not done a real good job of testing the camera yet. Buy it and make your own carefully controlled tests, then decide.Hand held tests at very high magnifications are totally INVALID for lens critiquing purposes. Few people can hold that long lens steady enough. High ISOs will certainly help keep shutter speeds high, but it's the high ISO NOISE then that will ruin the image sharpness .. not the lens.Use a SOLID tripod to test the long zoom for yourself. Do it at ISO 100 first.At my work, photographing motorcycles indoors, hand held, under less than optimal lighting, I have used the camera at ISO 1200. Plenty of noise but these images are used at 1024 x 768 (72 dpi) on the internet. The noise at that size and resolution is invisible and the available light shots are quite usable..The weakness I see and have not found a solution for is highlight clipping. In my tests, light subjects were hard to hold detail in. Perhaps further experimentation with the picture controls may help. Noise seems to creep in early too.We can't have it all. Twenty to 1200mm is an amazing accomplishment for Panasonic. Remember this is a consumer level camera. At this price point it seems to represent a very good value and a very versatile photographic tool. Perfect? No. None of them are.My previous Panasonic was an FZ35 which, once I learned to use it properly, was an truly excellent camera. This one probably has a steep learning curve too.Giving a star rating was hard. With so little testing I hated to rate it yet. Too low ... too high??My advice is forget the \"stars\" and test the camera on YOUR own favorite subjects, then decide if it's any good. But, be fair to the camera and be sure any problems you encounter aren't YOUR personal technique problems.September 30,2013In the end I just could not love this camera. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I bought it mostly for the long end of the zoom but what I think is a decent lens is hampered by some other factors. Maybe the sensor, maybe the camera software, I don't know. I shot a lot of long zoom photos in bright light and high shutter speeds and for me it just wasn't quite there. High ISOs significantly mar the images after 250. If you do a lot of tripod work maybe this will work out for you. If the lens were \"faster\" ( like the FZ200), it might be much better, but it is what it is. The combination of sensor noise and slow lens at zoom combine to make less than optimal images when hand holding.Don't get me wrong, I did get some very nice images from the camera but I had to shoot a lot of frames and be very selective of the images. I'm not saying this is a BAD camera. It just didn't totally please me.I did like the 20mm aspect of the lens and used in shorter focal lengths I thought it did very well. I'm sure many will find this camera very useful and perfectly satisfactory. I personally will wait a wee bit more for the next round of improvements and try again.Compared with the really excellent images from my P7700, I just couldn't justify keeping it. DARN! Bottom line is I'd rather have a somewhat shorter zoom with a faster lens and a less noisy sensor that makes better images. I'm gonna miss that 20mm though .....", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice First Try, but a Bit of a Disappointment", "Author": "Randy Wakeman \"Randy Wakeman\"", "ReviewID": "R1UEM3O7G8JVEK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "By way of a mercifully brief introduction, I make a goodly portion of my living with the use of digital cameras, and have for a very long time. My applications are wildlife and the outdoors, product reviews, industry consulting work, and legal work. Part of the territory is optics, whether binoculars, laser rangefinders, scopes, or cameras. Image examples are readily found online and in print from numerous devices, you can check the latest issue of African Adventures magazine if you wish.The FZ-70 is Panasonic's attempt at entering the 1000-1200mm equiv. \"bridge camera\" market, joining the 1200mm equivalent Canon SX-50, the 1000mm eq. Fuji HS50, the 1000mm equiv. Nikon P520, the 1200mm eq. Sony HX300, and others. If you have been working with cameras for a while, as far as \"phenomenal\" and \"amazing\" image quality, well . . . everyone makes that model.  Just ask them.The reality of the situation is far less than amazing. There is no small sensor camera that competes with, for example, a basic D-SLR. The Nikon D5100, to cite just one example, currently sells for about $475, including an 18-55mm lens, and no small sensor camera can touch it. Size and convenience matters to a lot of folks, the reason a $750 compact like the Sony RX100 M2 gets so much press, even though that camera's excellent image quality is handily exceeded by full-sized system cameras.With sales of point and shoot cameras in a dramatic downward spiral, heavily pressured by smartphones, many of which have improved their imaging,  the long zoom range is one of the areas remaining with commercial appeal. It wasn't that long ago that ten times zoom was a \"super-zoom\" camera. Times have changed, although cameras are not totally reinvented every few months as the press releases would like you to believe. Spend enough time reviewing product, and you'll quickly develop a healthy sense of skepticism.The FZ-70 ostensibly replaces the FZ-60, though at a higher price point, a slightly slower lens, and significantly increased bulk and weight. The weight increase is understandable, as most of the camera weight is glass, yet the FZ-70 is bulkier than the Canon SX-50.For years, Panasonic has loudly associated this basic form factor of camera as \"with a Leica lens, Made in Japan,\" as in FZ20, FZ35, FZ60, FZ-47, FZ-100, FZ-150, and FZ-200. However, the FZ-70 breaks with the branding of the line: it is made in China, with a \"no-name\" lens. This has turned off a lot of people, quite understandably so, as Panasonic themselves has put the largest images of this camera on their own websites misrepresented as having a \"Leica lens.\" As it turns out, the apprehension many have had turns out to be justified.My example of the FZ-70 took noticeably soft, blurry pictures particularly at the end of its zoom range. It does not improve on the turtle-slow burst mode of the FZ-60, either, for 3 images is the limit. It is marketed as \"9 fps,\" but 9 frames are not happening. While Panasonic has not gone as eccentric as Sony with small photosites on a dinky sensor,  the SX-50 pixel size of 1.54 microns compared to the 1.34 micron pixel size of the FZ-70 seems to be significant enough for the SX-50 to outshoot the Panasonic consistently, along with the superior image stabilization of the SX-50.Panasonic has put out some very, very good lenses in times past (FZ200) but in the case of FZ-70, the no-name lens array can only be considered wonderfully adequate here. Panasonic sensors are often poor in tonal range, dynamic range, and color sensitivity. A look at DxO Labs results tells the tale: [...] . While sensor performance is only part of the equation, the terrific lens of the FZ-200 manages to close the gap in most shooting conditions with the SX-50. Here, the unremarkable FZ-70 lens quality offers no such help . . . and it shows.Moreover, there are a couple of key potential advantages that the FZ-70 ignored: the most significant being the articulated display of the SX-50. This class of camera that offers 1200mm reach is not a unique item, for the Fuji SL1000, Sony DSC-HX300/B, and the Canon SX-50 all have the exact same 1200mm (35mm reach). Of these five cameras, this Panasonic has by far the worst LCD of the group, something you use every time you use the camera. Canon has the only fully articulated display, while Fuji and Sony both have 920K dot displays that tilt. The FZ-70 finishes dead last in this department with its fixed LCD.Responsible grading of a product dictates that it reflects if the product works as promised and functions as described. The FZ-70 is one of the most ridiculously over-hyped products in recent memory, promising blazing fast speeds, phenomenal images, noise-free images, and phenomenal images in high-sensitivity shooting scenes. It does not deliver the low-light prowess claimed, nor does it deliver on its promise of being well-suited for capturing action.The FZ-70's \"bright\" F2.8-5.9 lens actually isn't quite as bright as the lens on its cheaper but more satisfying predecessor, the FZ-60 having an F2.8-5.2 lens array, and isn't close to the current FZ-200. The FZ-70's burst speed is no better than the FZ-60, either, and far behind the FZ-200, the Canon SX-50, and others. The images are not at all noise-free: it is ridiculous to market them as such. It has average shooting performance, slower than other cameras in the Panasonic line, not at all blazing fast. If truth in advertising was the sole criteria, this camera would rate zero stars, for it frenetically is promised and re-promised to be what it is not.If your expectations are more realistic, in bright light, you may well find its output acceptable, though it is outclassed by other bridge camera offerings in several categories, including those branded as Panasonic although with less optical zoom (FZ-200).  The more credible reviewers, such as Ben Pitt, have had similar reactions: \"A good all-rounder with a massive 60x zoom range, but overshadowed by the competition.\" That's a far more realistic assessment than the usual hollow gushes of disingenuous fawning.For the numerous reasons stated, the Canon SX-50 rates a spot in my working array, while this FZ-70 simply did not. The previous Panasonic FZ-60 takes better, sharper pictures than the FZ-70 particularly at the end of its focal range: it is lighter, less bulky, and at the time of its release, substantially less costly. While the FZ-60 was the best camera at its price point and class, the FZ-70 at its higher price point offers less image quality, and does nothing to improve upon the FZ-60's EVF, LCD, and poor three-image burst capacity. It is hard to call a heavier, more expensive FZ-70 that takes lesser quality images anything other than a disappointment.The FZ-70 fails in value to the bargain-priced Fuji SL1000 Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 16.2MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black), which has better quality LCD and EVF, and has (at least) as good IQ . . . for a lot less money, as the Fuji is currently @ $250 - $270 or so. For more advanced enthusiasts, the FZ-70 does not compare favorably with the Fuji HS50XR with its ground-breaking phase-detection AF. It fails in low-light capability and shooting speed to the FZ-200, which also has a far superior LCD and EVF. As as all-around mega-zoom, the similarly priced Canon SX-50 puts it to shame in IQ, image stabilization, better scene modes, a better (articulated) LCD, Zoom Assist / Zoom Framing Assist Lock, much better factory software, and so forth.Several cameras are as good or better performers, for less money. Several cameras are far superior in performance and features at similar price points. By lacking value, build quality, lens quality, a tilting or swiveling LCD, shooting performance, and image quality . . . the FZ-70 is just a \"me-too\" type of initial mega-zoom effort that can only be described as lackluster compared to its many competitors.\u00a92013 by Randy Wakeman & Randy Wakeman Outdoors.

I have bags full of camera equipment including a Mamiya RB-67, Pentax 6x7, Canon 5D Mk2, Canon T2i and a lot of glass so trust me when I say, this camera lives up to the pre-release hype.  I originally had my sights set on the Canon SX50 which is a good camera, but falls short of its Lumix peer.  My focus was to get an easy to use point-and-shoot camera for my wife since the SLRs were just too much for her to handle - but now she's going to have to fight me for it.  I will update this review as I gain more experience with the video and special functions (which there are many) in the future.  Until then, I recommend you get one while the price remains well below $400 because I don't think it will stay their long when the word gets out how great this camera performs.UPDATE: After using this camera for nearly 6-months, I am still VERY happy with it and the pictures it produces - and would be glad to share some of the shots.  I find the extremes between other reviewers ratings interesting since I have not experienced many of the negatives mentioned and have experienced most of the positive remarks.  This camera simply works for me.  I've shot everything from sports car road races to retirements to scenery with great success and carrying this 1 lb 7.2 oz camera sure beats the heck out of hauling my 12 lbs of 5D Mk 2, with dual battery pack and 50-500mm Sigma lens around all day plus a couple extra lenses and batteries in a camera bag.  I also have no trouble taking my shots to 13x19 inch prints from either RAW or JPEG format files.  I've also read this camera is big and bulky.  Well, if you wear XXL gloves like I do, it fits just right in my hands.  It also works much better in my wife's hands than the DSLRs we have (T2i in addition to the 5D)so she is happy too! The weight is simply not a concern to us as we've both carried it around all day without any problems or side effects.  In fact, now that the price has dropped to $249 I'm going to buy another one to keep peace in the family.Several reviewers mentioned soft pictures at the 1000 to 1200mm end of the zoom range.  I'd bet your paycheck that most of the problem is camera movement since it is very difficult to hand hold any camera still enough at this extreme magnification to get a super sharp picture - regardless of image stabilization system employed.  I've had much better luck using a monopod or even better, a solid tripod (as one reviewer suggested) to get those very sharp long range shots.I also discovered the automatic backlit scene sensing and exposure system when I moved to the fully automatic setting - very effective!But as I said, the proof is in the final product so if you would like to see a sample of images - reply to this review and include your email address and I'll share a few with you.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Zoom and Extra wide Angle Camera, Great for the beginner or Advanced User.", "Author": "Roger James \"Doc\"", "ReviewID": "R3L9PAZJZLKRUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like the FZ70 especially the super wide angle and extra zoom in the lens and now priced around $300. The super wide angle is rather unique in a super zoom and great for landscapes and indoor shots. The F2.8 at wide angle allows for pretty good low light images. It\u2019s rare to see really wide angle in any lens but it does present a problem finding a lens hood that will work at extreme wide angle. The FZ70 is really a stripped down version of the more expensive FZ150/FZ200 with a much bigger zoom lens, different sensor, and missing many extra important features which an experienced image taker expects. These features are nice to have but really not necessary features for the beginner or someone like myself with other cameras.The FZ70 is very easy to hold and still snap sharp images or take excellent video with its separate video button. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is fair but not large or as bright as the more expensive models such as the FZ200.  It\u2019s good enough for bright light or low light but not great.I think this camera is aimed mainly for the beginner or anyone considering buying a dSLR but not prepared to spend the hundreds or thousands for extra lenses beyond the kit lenses included with most dSLR.  It appealed to me for the wide angle and extra zoom. The FZ70 will take macro images but it not nearly as good as any dSLR or MFT (micro four thirds cameras)The image stabilization on the FZ70 is outstanding just like the FZ150/FZ200. I was able to get sharp hand held images at 60X zoom most of the time. It should be impossible to do that but with some extra bracing, the sharp images were close to all of the time.  I think the Panasonic FZ150/FZ200 has the best image quality for the bridge cameras but there is not a huge difference. The FZ70 images are very good and sometimes breathtaking. I checked out an assortment of wide angle to full zoom images and was amazed just how good they were.  An example\u2026.I took an image of a house 1/5 of a mile from the camera, hand held at full zoom. I could almost see the individual granules in the shingles and individual leaves in the trees behind the house.  I can\u2019t do that with my Canon 60D dSLR and $600 zoom lens.  I recently took the FZ70 along with an Olympus OMDEM5 with a Panasonic 14-140, that combination cost 6X the FZ70 to the local zoo. I used the FZ70 for the wide angle images and the extreme zoom images. I captured in sharp detail, all the animals in their habitat as if I was right next to them. The OMD allowed capturing images through any cages or fencing, something that is nearly impossible to do with the FZ70. The EVF for the OMD is vastly superior which you would expect, which made image taking much easier with that camera. It also had touch controls and more adjustment capable but is not as user friendly as the FZ70.  So how did the images compare?  Amazing close in sharpness which was very unexpected. The OMD captured much more detail and better color, but you expect that with a larger sensor and better lens.Is the camera easy to use?\u2026.extremely easy. 100 times easier than my OMD or 60D.  The setup is easy, just turn the dial to ia and press the shutter \u00bd way to focus and then press all the way. When you grip the camera and use the EVF, your images will be vastly improved over your phone or LCD compact camera.What about all those 1 or 2 star reviews you may have noticed?  Each of those reviews has pointed out some deficiency which the reviewer experienced with the camera. I believe most of it is unfamiliarity with the camera rather than a defect. An example:  1. blurry images=hand shake during exposure or speed too slow, using full zoom in too low of light\u2026solution, use flash or raise the ISO . 2.  Audio noise when zooming\u2026at full zoom the camera\u2019s microphone amplifies sound especially at full zoom. 3. Slow startup\u2026big zoom needs time under a second to set itself.  4. Missing features\u2026..to keep cost low, unneeded features not included with this camera.  5. Cheap build\u2026Mostly plastic\u2026 To keep camera light, inexpensive and durable, plastic is the way to go. Metal frames add a lot of weight and cost and defeat the purpose of easy to carry around camera. My OMD is much smaller but also much heavier with it all metal framework. I can take images in very wet conditions something not recommended with the FZ70 but who wants to take pictures in the rain? It does help in humid or dusty conditions.If you do not want to spend much over $300, this camera is a great deal. If you have some extra money, I think the FZ200 is the way to go but it is missing the extra zoom and wide angle, but the FZ200 is more compact and takes outstanding images, video  and is great in low light. If you like just automated settings, the FZ70 is a very good choice.  Read the manual first\u2026it\u2019s online. Basic and Advanced. If you have a tablet, who doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s an easy to read PDF.

I'm a long time FZ user with the most recent ones being theFZ100, FZ150, and the legendary FZ200. So how does the FZ70 compare? I've taken this on multiple family trips, day-to-day shooting, and even in a studio setting. Here are the strengths and weaknesses from my heavy use with the camera:Strengths- Sharp at 20mm at the wide end. The cost of this camera is lower than most dedicated wide angle lenses. If nothing else, you can keep a FZ70 in your bag as an always ready wide angle option.- 5fps with autofocus. Perfect for capturing fast moving action since the camera focuses after every shot.- Super range. 20-1200mm is just insane. 1200mm shots have come out well which wasn't the case with the Sony HX300V. I could not get sharp shots past 800mm on the Sony.- Great video quality at 720p 60p.- Nice and lightWeaknesses- EVF and LCD resolution is average to poor.- No 1080p 60p video- 20mm is too wide for the casual super zoom user- It takes technique and practice to get consistent results at 1200mmConclusionI saved the biggest strength for this wrap up and that is the sensor and the processing engine. Right away the shots I was getting out of the FZ70 showed better dynamic range and stood up to post processing extremely well. The JPEG engine is really great, but the raw files are something special. The amount of detail retained is impressive.That said, this is still a budget bridge camera so keep your expectations in check. I purchased it at a lower price than the initial four hundred asking price and it's available for closer to three hundred now so it's a great bargain.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "C C.", "ReviewID": "R3OFJ4HOJJCP0M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from FZ60/2 to this model as I wanted ability to shoot in RAW format, hotshoe for flash and for the extra zoom.All round I am extremely pleased with camera: handles well and feels solid and chunky but not too heavy.

In amongst all the zooming options I shouldn't forget to mention the wide angle ability (20mm) which is significantly better on this model and excellent both for landscapes and indoorsAlso pleased with clarity and simplicity but also the depth, of the menu settings and ease of access - normal via menu button, quick menu button and via scroll dial plus two customisable shortcuts.  This has made using the manual settings straightforward. One other plus point is the start up speed - I would estimate at approx 1 second.Picture quality has been very pleasing from macro to zoom - even on large PC monitor displayDownsides - no real negatives - I'd have liked the LCD not to be fixed but really just a quibble rather then a complaint Extremely pleased I upgraded and delighted with the camera's performance.

Fieser", "ReviewID": "R3DC4GG9ZYP91L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I  had  the FZ47 and have the FZZ00. The FZ47 was a great bargain priced all around camera. The FZ200 has the F/2.8 max aperture lens (from 25mm to 600mm), which makes it a favorite for people who need fast shutter speeds in an affordable package. The FZ70 is, to me, a pumped up FZ47 with double the zoom range. The picture quality is decent and, in good lighting, very good. There is some geometric distortion at full wide angle. If it bothers you, you can correct it in software.  It focuses pretty fast, faster, I think, than the FZ47. Its top burst mode is fast, but shallow - about 3 shots in half a second. In this way, it's much inferior to the FZ200, which fires off shots like a machine gun and goes over 10 shots before pausing briefly to process them. The FZ200 has an articulating LCD scree while the FZ70 doesn't. The EVF is also much sharper in the FZ200.This is not a camera for someone to take to a night time HS football game under the lights. It simply won't get you a fast enough shutter speed to freeze the action as the max aperture at full zoom is F/5.9. However, it could be useful for soccer moms and dads for daylight games. No part of a football field or soccer pitch would be too far for the sideline fan.  It would also be useful for football and baseball fans who sit far from the field and want to get shots of their favorite coaches or players from high up in the stadium during day games. Other people who might like this camera include real estate agents who can get \"the whole house\" easily at the 20mm setting and amateur enthusiasts taking pictures of large groups at work or school.Its intelligent auto mode is actually pretty sharp, picking the appropriate mode (portrait, landscape, night time portrait, low light, etc.).It's not an upgrade from the FZ200. It's an upgrade from the FZ60. However, for less than 400 bucks in the US, I think it's a  good deal.If you are a photographic perfectionist, a so-called \"pixel peeper\", don't get this camera.

Others have mentioned and tested the camera hardware and image quality ad infinitum, so I only want to point out several items that haven't been mentioned in other reviews:1. The tripod mount is not aligned with the axis of the lens--it is offsetted to the right side of the camera by about 2.5cm (1 in).  This matters quite a bit for panoramas.  Since there is no in-camera panorama or panorama guide, the axial shift means a need to be conscientious about the framing and focal length choices.  Making sure there is sufficient inter-shot overlaps and the perspective distortion of the overlapping areas.  May also need a little bit more post production work during the stitching process.2. At 1200 equivalent, the aperture has a narrow range of f/5.9 to 8, meaning more precise focusing is necessary--cannot rely on depth of field to compensate.3. Image stabilization is not even close to the same level as a DSLR or even the Olympus OM series.4. The EVF-LCD switch is manual because there is no eye sensor.  If you are used to automatic switching, it should not be a big deal to go to manual because the switch is within easy reach of the thumb.  The eyepiece for the EVF is hard plastic so eyeglass wearers would find that uncomfortable and doesn't block stray lights.5. A step down ring 55-52 will not work at the widest angles (~20mm-24mm).

If you're considering this camera, know that you probably won't find it in any but the largest camera stores and the online price varies widely. Last week on Amazon it varied from $249.00-349.00, and that's on the one site! Needless to say, I waited until it was $249. I\u2019m not a professional photographer so this isn\u2019t a technical review, but I\u2019ve been taking pictures for about 50 years, first with Kodak roll film box cameras, then a twin lens reflex, then a series of manual 35mm cameras (no light meter), and culminating in my ultimate 35mm, a Nikon FM. I\u2019ve used various digital cameras that my wife owned, including a Minolta and a Canon ELPH. Until I bought my wife a Canon SX50 last xmas, I was not ready to give up my Nikon but the Canon astounded me with its picture quality, small size, light weight, and of course that 50X optical zoom (effectively 24-1200mm). After selling my Nikon, I was about set to buy another SX50 for myself when I saw the Panasonic FZ70. What attracted me was the 20mm wide angle and 60X optical zoom as well as the manual control options. I was turned off by some of the reviews regarding picture quality especially compared to the SX50 but after re-reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and ordered it and I\u2019m glad I did. I set it on a tripod and photographed a tree about a half mile away, first at wide angle then at 60X zoom and another at 50X zoom. And I did the same thing with her Canon. Despite tripod shake and a strong wind blowing the tree, the FZ70 took a remarkably clear shot at 60X. At 50X it actually appeared to have more detail than the Canon when viewed on my computer. I liked the colors with the Canon better but the colors are adjustable on the Panasonic so I could probably duplicate the results. I wish there was a way to upload the photos so I could show you.  Also, the 20mm on the Panasonic is a real advantage for me because I shoot mostly landscapes and the panoramic feature works as advertised, enabling you to take up to a 360 degree shot in one pass! Close-ups are also astounding, without even enabling a macro feature. As mentioned by another reviewer, the on/off switch does seem flimsy but at least you won\u2019t turn it on or off accidentally. It\u2019s also bigger and bulkier and hard to find a case for \u2013 I ended up ordering a Tamrac 5210 from Cameta Camera on Ebay which should fit. If you buy this camera and use a UV filter at all times as I do to protect the lens, follow one reviewer\u2019s recommendation and get a quality multi-coated glass filter like the Sigma, because cheap filters can affect the clarity. I bought a set of Vivitar filters for my wife\u2019s Canon from Digital Goya through Amazon and they seem fine but I opted for the more expensive Sigma for my Panasonic. To summarize, don\u2019t believe everything you read. Different cameras perform differently under different conditions with different settings. Decide what\u2019s important  to you and try several if you can. I\u2019d be perfectly happy with another Canon SX50; it\u2019s a great camera, but I\u2019m glad I took a leap of faith and bought the Panasonic. No more film, no more lens changing, and I sold my Nikon and a Samsung camcorder which more than paid for the Panasonic \u2013 I\u2019m a happy camper. If you\u2019re a professional, neither will probably replace your SLR or DSLR or camcorder, but for the rest of us, these open a whole new world of photography.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hoping it will be great", "Author": "Informed Shopper \"hal2007\"", "ReviewID": "R1EY0DMH1IN9R3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received my new Panasonic DMC-FZ70 from Amazon.  First thing is that I had preordered it and the price changed by the time I had delivery.  Called Amazon and explained the problem and the very polite lady credited my account with the difference.  It turns out that if you preorder you must call them if the price changes.  They do not automatically credit your account.  Hope this little bit of information will save money for anyone else who preordered.Now as to the camera itself.  So far I am absolutely thrilled and hopeful.  It replaces an old FZ-7 which still works but the new features and the wide angle on the FZ70 made me want it.One odd thing is that when the camera is turned on there is a very soft continuous sound coming from the camera when you are doing nothing with it.  So I called the Panasonic support folks and they were essentially worthless and suggested sending the camera back.  I called a local camera store and by luck they had one sitting right there.  The very polite lady listened to my question and said well it shouldn't be making any noise.  Then she turned their FZ70 on and she held it up to her ear and said \"oh my golly there is a continuous noise\".  Bingo!  With two cameras doing it perhaps then this is normal.  The sound as near as I can describe it is very soft and makes me think of an old coffee percolator that would be in the other room.So far every feature on the camera seems to work just fine.  I was surprised to see that it was built in China because my FZ-7 was built in Osaka Japan and somehow I had been led to believe that this series was built in Japan.  That is not a deal killer for me.The weight and feel of this is impressive compared to my older FZ-7.  Fits a man's hand better.The software that comes with it is impressive.  I bought a Hoya Alfa MC UV and lens protector from Amazon in the 55mm size and it should protect the lens and not degrade the photos.  Bought the Transcend 32GB SDHC. Bought the AGFA Photo Heavy Duty Rubber lens hood in 55mm and that is a bit problematic.  I believe I will keep it for outdoor shots but for flash it is in the way of the distance finder which apparently determines the amount of flash.  Also in full wide angle there is a very slight interference but a slight zoom out from full wide angle and that fixes that. At any rate I will keep the lens hood and just screw it in as needed and not tighten it so it can be removed quickly. To many times in sunlight I find a lens hood to be a necessity. Can't wait to get some pictures and video to see the quality and update this review.UPDATE:  Still very happy and the quality of the photos is exactly what I hoped for.  The low light capability is excellent and beyond what I was expecting.  Using it mostly in the AI and Scenery modes.  Very impressive.  More capability here than I would expect for this price.  I had actually considered the Nikon D7100 but thought the weight wasn't something I wanted to be hiking with.  More going on inside this little jewel than I have time to understand but wow.  Example is in the AI mode I was using the zoom to take a close up and the symbol on the screen changed to the little flower which on my old FZ7 would have been a setting for taking close-ups of things like flowers.  I will be using it today at a soccer meet with my Granddaughter playing and can't wait to see how it performs.  For this price point you can't beat this camera.Shot a small video also and used the zoom quite a bit to see how the stabilization worked.  Well the video was better than my dedicated Panasonic HD camcorder.  So I will just be carrying one camera now.One small thing that I do wonder about is the lens.  Is it a Leica?  Doesn't say Leica on the lens like my old FZ7 and frankly for the quality of the pictures I'm getting it doesn't matter but that little L on the camera body ....always thought that was for Leica but maybe it is for Lumix.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "A good, good, good (bridge) camera", "Author": "A.

But, one month later, I can say that I am in love with this camera and I am actually using it in instances where I would normally take shots with a phone or a small point-and-shoot AND in most instances where I would have brought a DSLR before I had a the opportunity to try out this LUMIX.This being my first Panasonic camera of any kind, learning it wasn't easy but, after taking some time getting used to it, it does become 'second nature', eventually. It took me about one month to advance from the basic 'all auto' settings to maybe half-way to 'pro' skills and, not being a professional photographer, I may not advance much farther. I can already take near-perfect HD video with clear stereo sound, macro photos, beautiful low-light shots and, with a tripod, I did a pretty good portrait of the Moon at 60x zoom and max res. I am currently experimenting with a third-party flash and I continue to be impressed by my output's quality and the ease of getting it that way.Of course, not everything is perfect. Yes, it's not a DSLR and it doesn't support Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or 'location', meaning that you will be transferring your work out either through a wire or a card reader adapter and you'll have to make a not of where the photo was taken - I personally don't care much about these features but no everyone is 'me' so it's worth stating it. I also do notlike the non-standard USB cable for data transfer but I'm using a card reader anyway so yes, it's bad but not too bad.Not a negative at all because it's customary, but it's worth noting that you need to supply your own carrying case, memory card because the 300MB or so built in won't take you too far.I like this LUMIX a lot and after all these years of juggling between phones and point-and-shoot and DSLRs for 'serious' events or happenings, I may just stick with the 'bridge' because it's so much fun to use while giving me almost everything I could squeeze out of a DSLR and often more: incredible zoom power, movies and microphone quality, flexibility in setting picture format and resolution.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Should be illegal!!!", "Author": "Ben Johnson \"creativity lover\"", "ReviewID": "R2BAZWMYTC7SC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A quick, short review is all that is needed.

I'm marginally disappointed with that camera because it's slow and too noisy in low light but at the time of purchase I was pleased with it's zoom (25-500mm).  Four short months this camera was released and as it's the only light weight camera with a 20mm wide angle I just had to try it.  Despite the fact I can't just slip it into my pocket the FZ70 is very light.  I'm 6' tall and the palm grip doesn't strike me as overly diminutive so I can see myself carrying this around with out a strap and not experiencing hand cramps.Despite reading a number of negative reviews, initially, I'm very pleased with the quality.  Low light for a 1/2.3\" sensor'd camera is better then I expected, in fact it's better then the SX280HS (same size sensor) I purchased just a few months prior.  The negative comments surround picture quality, I could not duplicate a scenario that yielded a photo of \"poor\" quality.  While the images are not perfect they are better, IMO, than other point and shoots and perhaps equal to prosumer options from say five or six years ago.Cons:  Finding a bargain - This camera's price seems to be jumping around from the original retail price so be careful.  Thanks to the super zoom and the uninitiated's inability to get a steady shot there are plenty of these as \"used\" which are in fact open box.  Be sure to read the descriptions when sorting through the used vendors as some are missing accessories.  I purchased mine as \"used\" and it arrived with all accessories, repacked in the original box, fulfilled by Amazon Warehouse Deals for nearly 30% off the already on sale price.Summary:  I consider myself an avid enthusiast.  I know how to use a camera in full manual, how to get a steady shot even with out OIS; in fact, I use a full size DSLR (5D mkiii) most times.  I will be using this for my upcoming vacation and leaving the bulky lenses and accessories for my DSLR at home.  I'll still take my jean pocket worthy Canon SX280HS with me but will use this for excursions and killing time on ship.  If you are looking for telephoto capability my recommendation is walk before you run - this camera is good but only if you are familiar with bracing techniques, manual ISO setting, and tripod use.  If you aren't comfortable with say, shooting in full manual mode go with a less expensive shorter range compact zoom.  Check DPReview's site for a great comparison tool.  IMO this camera is as good as it gets for size, zoom range, and low light quality.  Not considering the value of the total package this would be a good camera to have at any price point within it's class of capabilities so if it's not on sale don't mark it off your list.11/22/2013 UPDATE:Add some Pros & Cons:Pros:  I've shot 354 photos, about 150 outdoors, some with fill flash and the remainder inside, most with flash.  I'm very impressed with the battery life, the display indicates I have full battery life remaining even after all that use.  My indoor use consisted of walking around at the convention center here in San Antonio for the Auto Show.  The cameras display stayed on for about 1.5 hours during the time I was taking photos.  Also I wanted to point out the OIS is amazing.  I shot most of my shots today, indoors, in manual mode most at 1/25th of a second some at 1/20th at ISOs between 100 & 400.  Hand held sometimes zooming up to 16 or 18x and the shots came out crystal clear.  I believe out of about 200 shots I may have had two that were not usable due to camera shake.  I don't believe I would have achieved this with my heavier 5Dmkiii with the 24-105mm with IS.  I did have to employ bracing techniques, holding breath, gently pressing shutter and using any railing I could find to lean up against, but no tripod or mono pod.Cons:Pano mode, while it works great, does not have a manual exposure control.  Indoors it forced me to use ISO2000 which leads me to the next con, poor image quality in low light.  I don't know if its a sensor problem or a compression issue as I was using jpg.  It's not terrible but even at ISO400 it's noticeable.  I had spend most of the day yesterday photographing my dogs between ISO 400 & 1600 while indoors and first noticed it but inside the house it's a bit darker then at an auto show.  I knew to try and avoid ISO800 but after today I'd say if you can get the shot somehow with a lower ISO setting, say 200 or the lowest of 100 you'll appreciate the results - so a tripod, mono pod, or bracing techniques are a must.A side note regarding perception of the camera itself.  Last year I used my 5D mkiii at the auto show and I went unnoticed.  This year, with the FZ70, arriving early to the auto show I was approached by some of the presenters who thought I was the official photographer - go figure...As soon as I knew I liked the camera I ordered a spare set of batteries and charger.  Considering how great the battery life is I sort of regret getting two extra batteries.Pack Of 2 DMW-BMB9 Batteries And battery Charger for Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ40K DMC-FZ45K DMC-FZ47K DMC-FZ48K DMC-FZ60 DMC-FZ70 DMC -FZ100 DMC-FZ150 Digital Camera + More!!", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Feature rich, good quality optics and tons of zoom", "Author": "Sprout", "ReviewID": "R3W0PRD2DIA8RZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First thing I wanted to test was the zoom and image stabilization on this camera.  I'm used to carrying around big DSLRs but they require very large lenses to get the sort of zoom you can get on this camera.  Now, the OIS on this is pretty good, but it won't let you hand-hold a shot at full zoom, especially if you're not in anything less than full daylight.  I was able to get some usable shots by resting my hands against a solid object (doorframe for example), so a full-on tripod isn't required to use full zoom, just a way to stabilize yourself as well.Feature-wise, this camera has everything you've come to expect in fixed-lens superzooms.  Several automatic and scene modes, but also a fairly usable manual mode.  I enjoyed using macro mode, something that's not easy to do on a DSLR without a specific lens or accessories.  The panorama mode works very well and is actually my favorite feature on this camera.  I haven't extensively worked with the video, but from casually playing with it, it seems pretty solid too.My only complaint, and this is really true with all cameras of this type, the image quality pales in comparison to even bottom-level DSLRs or DSLRs a few generations old.  Anything that's not shot in bright daylight gets noisy pretty fast.

I don't own a lot of compact cameras. I have experienced with several DSLRs from Canon, Nikon and Pentax. This camera has similar or even better quality than the entry level DSLR, but definitely less solid than mid-range or full frame ones (Nikon D90, Canon 7D, 5D Mark...). The body is all plastic expect for the hot shoe. The hot shoe design is not perfect. My Yongnuo-560II cannot fit in because of the big built-in flash housing next to the hot shoe. The pop-up flash can trigger the off-camera flash without problem. I think this is a good thing for people who is learning photography.Lens quality:I am satisfied with the image quality. DO NOT expect some DSLR or mirrorless cameras' image quality. This camera can do a lot of things that others cannot with such a low cost. The image is perfectly fine for travel and family. The zoom and focus are relatively quick and quiet. I will upload some images when I shoot more with it.Low light performance:ISO 800 and 1600 are usable. For 4X7 or 5X7 print, you can even consider ISO 3200, which is the highest for this camera. It is not very interesting to zoom 100% or check pixels for this camera (or any other camera). Again, this is perfect for travel or family use.Others:1200mm is possible with hand-held, but you need good light and at least 1/200 shutter speed.The manual could be better.

The zoom is remarkable, but after you use the camera for a while you find out some wonderful things that are not really talked about.First, the camera does a remarkable job recognizing back lite scenes and compensates remarkably well.  If for example you open the flash and there is a bright window behind the person whose picture you are taking it compensates perfectly.  Often it can compensate for back lite without the flash, but it will remind you when back light requires flash.Second, with flash skin tones are remarkable.  Also, most flashes on little cameras wash out at close range this one doesn't.  It also compensates so that you don't find people up close are overexposed while everything in the background goes dark.  Obviously this only works up to a point.I always shoot with the the red label (iA). you have nothing to lose and much to gain. This provides a modest HDA exposure that doesn't scream \"manipulation\" and also, I believe, provides some sharpening.Even with a sturdy tripod it is just about impossible to keep the camera steady while pushing the shutter button at 60X.

This camera produced better pictures than my friend's Rebel.  This FZ70 is bulky & gets weighty over the course of the day, but when going between distance & zoom, and between speed shots & low light shots, it is hard to beat.  The only thing I couldn't do was switch to black & white photos, which would have been cool in the fog._______________________________________________________________________________________The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 is called a bridge camera because it is a step above a point & shoot, but a step below an SLR camera.  As a traveler and someone who frequently goes between regular view and zoom for variations of the same shot, a camera like this Lumix \"all-in-one\" continues the best camera to suit my needs because I don't have time or patience to switch lenses, and a lens that can handle regular to zoom on an SLR camera is easily a thousand dollars.The DMC-FZ70 is my third Lumix camera, and each one has gotten progressively better (and larger).  The FZ-70 packs a lot of features, including panoramic and RAW capabilities.  Its functionality in indoor light situations is much better than my previous Lumix cameras.  As with my other Lumix cameras, I never use a tripod, and the stability feature of this camera is as good as the previous models.  To stabilize, I wrap the shoulder strap around my left hand & hold the camera taut.Outdoors, full zoom is marvelous. On some of my pictures at full zoom, using the standard camera settings, I could see a tiny bit of noise, but overall, the camera really performs well in outdoor settings. Performance-wise, the camera's colors consistently look good and the camera consistently produces pictures that look natural.The Lumix, does have its limitations. Low light still pictures with no zoom are your best bet for a good shot. Indoor movement (gym situations) with zoom is difficult to achieve. Using a flash will help, but you will have to play with your camera speeds (ie, don't rely on the standard camera settings).  If you can't use a flash indoors, take time to play with your camera in different settings to see what works best for your particular situation.  With time & practice, you will get to know your camera & you will get the shots you want.For its price and features, this Lumix DMC-FZ70 is hard to beat.

My dream has always been a FZ200, but finances do not permit that at this time.  Although the G3 had very, very good image quality and even great video (in good light), a m4/3 or DSLR is an investment item.  You need to invest in lenses which can be very costly, add to that having to carry around extra gear and swapping lenses on the fly.  That being said, let's look at the FZ70.I did some sample shots inside the house in a dimly light room.  Images up to ISO1600 were pretty good for a 1/2.3 sensor.  The wide 20mm lens helps, as does the f2.8 in low light.  The aperture quickly drops as you zoom in on objects.  I  shot some video in the same dim light and objects near the light source are great!  Speckeled noise is much more visible in lower light areas.  AUTO video does a pretty decent job - there is a slight auto-focus noise as the camera focuses during video.  I look forward to using the camera outside in brighter light.  My guess is the camera will perform wonderfully for both stills and video.  The FZ70 60x zoom is a bit much, anything beyond 25x probably needs a tripod.  IT would be nice if you could set a zoom limit.  I will update this as I use the camera more.  For sub $300, I think it's a great value.  Knowledge of a camera's PASM settings will help a great deal here as you can really break through the surface features if this camera and get a lot out of it.UPDATE:One Month Later:  This camera needs a lot of light to perform at its best.  (I know, it only has a 1/2.3 sensor...)  It's tough to get really good indoor shots, even with the flash.  Noise is present at 1600 ISO +.  If anyone has suggestions on how to get better indoor images with this camera, please share your advice.  In bright light, the camera excels.  Images are a tad soft, but Auto+ does a great job producing solid images.  I've never seem a camera shoot so well in Auto.  I like AUTO+ because you still have control over some items like exposure.  I read that it is recommended to drop exposure by 1/3.  I've tried this and the results are great.  No blow outs of over-exposing.  I want to \"love\" this camera, but right now I just \"like\" it.

My Fujifilm camera (which is a 30x optical super zoom camera) had trouble focusing at times when taking indoor shots and some outdoor shots.  This camera had no focusing problems in Intelligent auto worthy of reporting.I also found the white balance on this camera to be a step above my Fujifilm S4000.  It required me to use my flash more indoors so it could focus and that wasn't so much of an issue with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70.  It took several indoor shots without the need for a flash and it had real time focus creating images that were sharp and clear.On the long end of the optical zoom I did notice some noise in the image, but that's to be expected with a lens this powerful.  It performed very well in high range zoom and in both video and picture taking modes.  It's ability to focus in real time during video mode is pretty good and I tested it during a snow storm just to make it a little harder on the camera.It's been boasted online that you can extend the zoom range on this camera by scaling down megapixel setting.  It does say that in the manual, but I haven't tested that feature.  What I do like about this camera however, is that on the low end of zoom at 20mm, it lets you take a wider shot than other cameras in it's class and some of them even cost more than this camera.Would it be nice if it had a larger sensor?  Perhaps, but I haven't really seen any super zoom camera's that compete with it that have a larger sensor anyway.  That's probably more for an expensive DSLR anyway.  Besides, this camera takes pretty good pictures without the larger sensor.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with it and it's sure better than my old FUJI in every way.I don't know if my opinion counts for anything but I can tell you this is a pretty nice camera.  I'm glad I bought it and I'm thoroughly happy with it and I bet there's a good chance you will be to.

This effectively forces me to be very selective about when I push the release button, especially when I'm shooting action scenes. Another issue is the fixed monitor screen, which isn't much help when the camera is pointed at the sky. Again, I'm spoiled, I suppose, by the FZ200's rotating display.

From here, all references to lens focal length will be in 35 mm film photography equivalent.For about $300, you get a 60X lens that stretches from a heretofore unheard of 20 mm ultra wide to 1200 mm super telephoto, all in a relatively small and light package. Most super zoom cameras have a zoom range of 24X to 50X, and the wide end usually starts at 24 mm or 28 mm. You won't believe how much wider 20 mm is until you compare pictures of the FZ70 with \"lessor\" super zooms taken at the widest setting.If you shoot video, the microphone's sound gathering capability will adjust with the zoom lens's focal length, so that even when you zoom in, you can get good sound from a distance.Other than being an excellent value, the FZ70 gives you the ultimate in convenience. There is no need to haul a whole bag of heavy lenses in order to take different shots. The magic is in the size of the image sensor, which is 1/2.3 inch. This is much smaller than sensors in APS-C or Micro Four-Thirds cameras. But also because of its smaller size, it becomes possible to design a super zoom camera with an astonishing zoom range. If you use a full-frame camera, the zoom range is about 3X to 4X at most before the lens physical size, weight, and cost become prohibitive.So the trade-off is image quality vs. convenience vs. cost. The FZ70 takes, IMHO, excellent pictures and video. It won't do as well in low light situations when compared to cameras with larger sensors, but the pictures and videos are still very good to excellent.I prefer using the zoom lens on this kind (superzoom/bridge) of camera, because it allows quick AND smooth zooming action using the convenient, powered zoom ring around the shutter release. Most DSLR cameras do not have this feature; you need to twist the zoom lens itself, which cannot be done smoothly throughout its zooming range. This is especially important when shooting video.If you want to know more about this camera, both before and after purchase, you can download two official FZ70 owner's manuals by googling \"fz70 owner's manual\". The Basic manual is 34 pages long, while the Advanced manual is 226 pages.For me, I believe that the best camera is one that I can take with me all the time, without straining my neck, shoulder, or wallet.I highly recommend the Panasonic Lumix FZ70 for convenience and travel photography.

Basically I set it to auto everything and I'm just loving the images I'm getting. Will be taking it on our Europe trip later on this summer. Just a quick example: Last week during the full \"blood moon\" we had a great view of it here in California. I put the camera on a tripod, set the zoom to 100x and waited. When it went into full eclipse I touched the shutter button. Because of the low light it automatically took a series of 7 or 8 shots. I could hear it during the process. The aggregated image was spectacular. The blood moon effect was awesome. I put it up on FB and received many kudos for the shot. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Way to go Panasonic.

However, the two features that caused me to buy this camera are a huge disappointment. The 60X optical zoom produces fuzzy unusable pictures at the high end of the zoom. I have no idea why Panasonic would advertise such a high powered zoom that performs so poorly. Also, the burst shooting is a joke. Instead of the 9 FPS as advertised, I could only get 3, then wait, refocus, then 3 more. I could be at fault on not understanding how to use the burst feature, but not with the poor quality of the zoom.

I'm a mom who loves taking pictures of her kids, pets and flowers.  That being said - I love, love, love this camera.  I have never used a Panasonic camera before and I really like the looks and the high quality feel of this.  Using it on full auto, snapping pictures of kids. pets and flowers, and every single picture is beautiful.  Not even an average picture in the lot - everything comes out stunning - beautiful color, sharp images with a perfect focus.  Pictures taken in low light with no flash come out beautiful as well - in fact, I haven't used the flash on it yet.  My previous favorite camera was a Fujifilm FX1, and while I still love it, I think I like this Panasonic slightly better - it seems to be easier to get a nice sharp focus.  Both cameras are excellent in low light without a flash,  but in this scenario I think the Fuji has slighlty less noise and a teensy bit better color saturation.The best thing about this camera, is that you can literally just pick it up and shoot the picture and get gorgeous results, the second best thing about it is the zoom - at 60x you can zoom to your hearts content.  Perfect for kids sporting events.  It is also a little easier to focus at the farthest end of the zoom than I thought it would be.  I also have a SonyDSC-HX20v with a 20x zoom, and I think the panasonic is easier to focus at the highest zoom than the Sony is - however both require a steady hand at full zoom.  What I like about the Fuji and the Sony, though is that they are small enough to fit in a purse - whereas this Panasonic most definitely is not.  However, if you don't mind carrying around the larger camera, then I do think this is a slighty better value - since it combines the gorgeous image capability of the Fuji FX1 with the zoom of the Sony (plus even more zoom).  If you're looking for a high end camera but aren't ready for a DSLR (or if you have a DSLR and sometimes just want a simple point and shoot) then I would definitely recommend this one.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just about anyone should love this!", "Author": "Morley Dotes \"morleydotes\"", "ReviewID": "R11L3S65OTLG8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AMAZING zoom! If for no other reason, this camera gets 5 stars for the zoom! 60x optical zoom is impressive and very sharp, but what is even most impressive is the digital zoom! It is amazingly stable and sharp with little noise in side, and simply fantastic outside. You have many shooting options which is great. I have never been a fan of point and shoots for my serious photography, always relying on one of Canons. Well, I think that for the most part, I may not be using them much anymore (except for macro work). The Lumix DMC-FZ70 is amazingly versatile and can pretty much take care of all of your photography needs. Take a picture of a full moon with full zoom. It is amazing. I had to go into my settings because digital zoom was disabled on my camera. Once you do, you will never turn it off. I really cannot explain my level of awe from this camera. I doubt you will find its equal without spending at least twice as much! It is bulky, but it is a camera, and certainly not as bad as a DSLR plus lenses, etc. The flash works very well and is strong enough that I really cannot complain. The only real problem I had was filling up my 32 gig card too quickly. I started having fun again. Fun that I have not had with photography in a long time. I bought what I needed to be able to take pictures when I had to, but now I have a camera to take pictures because I want to. For me, that is a huge bonus. The camera is stylish and comfortable to use. Burst mode is fast but inside I did get a little blur between images, and it was not because of very fast action, but more when someone was moving their arm/hand. I have several different cards, but I really recommend something fast, like an extreme or extreme pro by san disk. They are so fast, and virtually no waiting. The camera starts up quickly and has almost no lag at all. I think most people would not notice it. I also love that I do not have to use the screen and often use the viewfinder. Video quality and sound is also very good. the camera is fairly intuitive and can be used without reading anything, but I HIGHLY suggest you read up on it and get the most out of this camera. If you are looking for a good general camera with great optics, look no further. You get down to 20mm, btw, which is wide enough to capture a large family reunion photo, and in the next shot you can fill the frame with one persons eye. The finish of the camera has a nice tactile feel to it, and the next strap, while not high end, is comfortable enough. I love that I no longer have to lug around my camera (suit)case. :)I recently recorded my sons bastkeball game and the video was great. I do notice that when I shoot in flourescent lighting, there sometimes is a yellowish hue when I use the flash and the distance is a little long. Still, this is a no brainer folks, I just turn off the flash.

The action shots when the sun was still up turned out great and I was at the tip top of the bleachers still getting closer shots then my old 24zoom!!

So far the indoor shots I took along with some outdoor ones are crisp, clear, and the 60 zoom is about as far as you can go without losing photo quality.

3-Inch LCD (Black) (this camera),---Canon PowerShot SX50 HS 12MP Digital Camera with 2.8-Inch LCD (Black),---Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 42x Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Black).The video shown is with the respective camera to show the zoom quality of that camera. (The videos were compressed).  On the Pany and Nikon, when you move the zoom lever all the way to the right then you are at maximum optical zoom.  The canon is a little tricky because if not careful you will end up using the digital zoom because moving the lever all the way to the right puts you in digital zoom mode.IMAGE QUALITYNone of these cameras will look as good as a dslr.---The Pany was true to color and appeared to have built in HDR ( when taking an image where half is in the shade and the other half sunny, the Pany took two images then automatically combined them).---The Canon looked a little washed out but images still looked nice.---The Nikon takes the best images IF the subject is static, but if you have a moving object expect to get blurry images from the Nikon.ZOOM CAPABILITIESBased on 35mm equivalents, you have the following for wide angle through telephoto.....Panas (FZ70)...60X... 20mm - 1200mm....Canon (SX50)..50X... 24mm - 1200mm....Nikon (P520)....42X... 24mm - 1000mmThe viewfinder and LCD on the Pany appear not to capture the entire area, once the image is on the computer it appeared to have a wider angle of view.  The extra wide angle is really nice.SOUND QUALITYThe Panasonic appear to have the best microphone of the bunch and hence the best sound quality.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!

I am mostly a point and shoot photographer.  The clarity is beautiful, crisp and clear. I take mostly landscape, sunrise and sunset shots.  I also pre-ordered this Lumix -and got a credit for the price difference.  The zoom is great! Last evening, I had the opportunity to take some long range pictures down the beach - and they came out very clear for the distance I was shooting.  Love the panoramic setting on the top dial of the camera for taking multiple shots of the beach side... A few pix came out with funny lines but most came out beautifully...Amazon Customer service staff were so helpful with all my questions.  I ordered the free shipping (5-8 days).  I received my camera in 3 days! Just in time for my trip!Back with an update.  Again, I've only been taking photos for a couple of years, so I'm still fairly new at all this. Took the Lumix to the beach last weekend... The camera performed well in the blue sky weather that prevailed. The panoramic setting is great for beach shots although I found some images had lines with some different light exposures.The biggest problem I'm having is red diagonal lens flares when I shoot sunset shots.  My Lumix (DMC-ZS10 w/ 16x zoom) or my husband's Canon Power Shot cameras never showed that much flare...As most of my pix are sunrises and sunsets, this is a big problems....any suggestions would be appreciated.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mediocre Image Quality", "Author": "Keith Blodgett \"Hawk\"", "ReviewID": "R3PDU37N1UPNJ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was impressed with the functionality of the camera. Focus was fast, shot to shot recycle time was impressive, battery life was astounding (well over 400 pictures and the battery just dropped by one indicator on the 3-light battery bar). The two speed zoom was nice, easy to control and fairly quiet. I liked that the mode dial appeared on the LCD when you changed settings. Heft and feel were rather nice.And that there's where the plus side ends...I shot over 850 images meticulously testing settings and options in numerous situations and ended up with three pictures I thought were really good.The low light capability even at 20mm wide angle was sub-par. One of my favorite activities is to sit at the beaches here in Florida and watch the sunrise. I've always got a camera with me. Images pre-dawn and at sunrise were... grainy, cluttered, blurry.Post dawn, full light shots of surfers looked like Pointilization art. Even when only zooming out 20x - 30x, far from the extreme limit of the camera, I didn't get one picture I bothered to keep out of well over 150 tries.I also went to a horse show. Full daylight, light fluffy clouds and again shooting well below the full 60x (1,200mm) zoom of the camera and the results were horrid, grainy, full of noise. Many shots looked like badly done art filters in Photoshop rather than photographs from a moderately expensive bridge camera. I also shot a few images at the horse show under the shade of trees and even in iA mode letting the camera pick all the settings and not zooming in at all, images were dark, mottled and grainy.In conclusion... I have an older 30x camera that's getting on in age. I had hoped to retire it and replace it with a new more modern camera. I just wasn't impressed enough with the Panasonic Lumix FZ70. The functionality was great but that's not the most important aspect of a camera, photo quality is and I just wasn't happy enough with the results and returned the camera.

I ordered this looking for a good super zoom unit.  I checked other reviews and noted the mixed ratings, but greedy for \"zoom\" ordered it anyway.\"Bad News\" is much like what others have reported in that you are paying for zoom and one of the \"give backs\" is in the processor.  In order to get really clear pictures I find that I need to use my monopod to steady the camera if using more than a modest amount of zoom.  It is early days and I am still learning to use the unit so I will update this as I go.  I also noted that Panasonic does not use a \"named\" lense on this unit like on my other cameras, which may also figure into things. I also am aware that talent may be an issue here too so I want to tread lightly here for the moment.The \"Good News\" is that it's a Panasonic.  It feels good, albeit a little large and the price via Amazon was very good.  The camera feels solid and the controls are well laid out. The view finders do a good job and Ai mode normally does a very acceptable job.I want to love this camera, but it is too early to tell if getting the zoom was worth it.02/23/2014 Update:I've had more experience with the FZ70 now and it really grows on you.  As recommended in other reviews, I've added a UV filter and a lens hood now that there is one for the camera.  Not being the best at camera manipulation, I found that working through the manual with the camera in hand is a big help.  I also found that using the flash indoors helped with photo sharpness.  I am also in process of working through and testing my camera setups to be sure, now that I am more familar with the beast, that I am achieving what I thought I wanted.  In the end there is just no substitute for using the camera in a range of situations as, while it is no DSLR, it is a whole lot more than a mere point and shoot camera.  I freely admit that most of my \"issues\" with the camera reside with me, and by working with the camera I am learning to appreciate all it has to offer.

I tried the camera for basketball and soccer and maybe got 5% useable pictures, the rest were blurry. I kept going back and reading directions and trying different settings.

The zoom alone has made the FZ70 a first option amongst my selection of cameras as of late and the image quality of photos taken past 50x is very impressive with sharp, detailed coloring.  One thing to keep in mind - once zooming past 10x a tripod is highly recommended for best results.  Overall I've been very pleased with final image results.  The MOS sensor does a fine job in reducing noise and with a max image size of 4608x3456, prints can be made up to 34x29 cm.Other things I like about the FZ70:+The image processor does a great job with full-resolution continuous shooting at 9 fps or 5 fps with autofocus.+Video quality also receives a thumbs-up with shooting resolutions of 1920x1080 @ 60i or 1280x720 at 60p in AVCHD or MP4.+The housing of the stereo microphones reduces wind noise very well.+The 3 inch LCD is gorgeous and vibrant but in daylight conditions the electronic view finder (with diopter adjustment) is appreciated.+The included battery is good for around 400+ shots.+The weight at 1.3 lbs is very reasonable when considering the zoom range of the lens.+Camera is quick and responsive and can go from power-on to shot taken in under 2 seconds.+The beginner friendly 'iA' mode takes great pictures.  Most users can probably stick with this mode for the majority of shots but there are plenty of other manual settings to experiment with once you're ready for it.One final tip - the one feature I wish this camera had is wifi for file management purposes but you could always purchase the new wifi enabled SD cards if desired.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not working out for me as well as I'd hoped", "Author": "Carol M", "ReviewID": "R3GCKUU5IROJPM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So you know where I'm coming from: I am not an accomplished photographer - just a mom who loves to great shots of her kids.  For the last few years, I've relied on my Pansonic Lumix F27.  It's a similar \"bridge\" camera, fitting between point and shoot and DSLR, but is now several years behind the times.  I also recently purchased a Panasonic Lumix TS5A, which is a compact waterproof point and shoot.The 60X zoom is what attracted me to the FZ70.  I thought it would help me get great shots of the kids doing their sports, music performances, etc from my seat far up in the stands.  But so far I am unable to get really clear shots at the full zoom length.  I have no doubt that I could get a good shot with a tripod, but it's usually not possible to bring a tripod and claim the aisle at these kind of events. I am getting some very nice shots at about half the zoom length, though.... but I am carrying around the bulk and weight of a 60X zoom, and not being able to use that full range effectively.I am somewhat disappointed in the burst mode of this camera.  It gets up to 9 frames to second.  Since my compact waterproof Panasonic gives me up to 60 frames per second, I just sort of expected that this \"more serious\" camera would at least be in the same ballpark.This camera also had problems with the autofocus when  used on a very cold day (about 10 degrees F).  Perhaps that would happen with any camera though?I will keep using this camera and trying to learn how to maximize its capabilities. It seems wrong that at this point, I prefer my older/lighter Panasonic bridge camera or my new compact waterproof camera to this one.  I'm probably missing something.  It's probably my fault.

I decided to get this Panasonic camera and several spare batteries for this camera. I have had other more compact Panasonic Lumix digital cameras over the past 8 years with generally great photos from those cameras.Overall, this digital camera looks very nice & rather professional-looking. I inserted a Class 8 4 GB SDHC card into this camera and turned on the camera and it indicated that the card was programmed by an external device. I was still able to use the SDHC card in this camera and it did take the photo & saved it with no problems. I tried several SD cards of various sizes and class and the odd message appeared each time about \"card programmed from an external device\", but I was still able to use those SD cards with no problems. Photo quality with moderate zoom is  acceptable but not excellent. I do not expect DSLR-quality photos with this camera & sure don't get them. Photos are more colorful but not as sharp compared to the Nikon P-510 camera I had before. I usually utilize the optical zoom quite a bit in my photos as I take many scenic and event photos and usually requires a long zoom to catch the photo without battling the crowds. Zoomed photos with this camera is just as fine as the Nikon P-510 camera. I have not shot videos with this camera yet, so I cannot comment on that.The good points with this camera are: Nice long 60X Optical zoom for 1200mm lens power compared to 35mm camera [I also have a Canon SX50-HS with 50X optical zoom and it also has 1200mm lens power]. I am not sure why the Panasonic with 10X more optical zoom is identical to the Canon's 50X optical zoom for 1200mm zoom power.Other good points include, nice-sized fixed-type LCD viewfinder on the backside, , easy to use menu, pretty easy to use, looks very well built and looks very professional, feels very good while taking photos, it can take RAW or JPEG photos, decent battery life & finally takes a decent photo with minimal zoom usage outdoors. Pretty decent general photo quality outside and inside, the photos turns out very nice with flash on. This is a deluxe \"Point & Shoot\" bridge-type digital camera and that's about it.The bad points I have spotted so far with this camera: No continous shooting mode...except for a few photos, issues with accepting various SD & SDHC cards, zoomed-in photo quality is only fair quality, & oddly the LCD screen is fixed into the camera and not tilt out or flip out like Canon and Nikon competing digital cameras.I am keeping this camera despite its few short-comings and maybe with a bit more time & some tweaks with the manual settings this camera has, maybe I can improve the photo qualities with this camera. This camera has potential & can be quite fun to use. Overall, I gave this camera 3 of 5 stars because of the questionable photo qualities when using moderate zoom & the SD card message I get on all SD or SDHC cards I use in this camera.If you want a decent general purpose digital camera with a pretty good zoom on it and don't need or want to carry around a DSLR camera outfit, for those rare occasions when you may need to get a zoomed-in photo, this camera should do the job.....especially if you are taking outdoor, scenic, family or indoor photos. If you're expecting to get fantastic DSLR-quality photos with this camera or while using the optical zoom....this most likely is not the camera for you. I think the rival Canon SX-50 HS takes a slightly better zoomed-in photo....up to a point & overall takes a better photo indoors or out.

High speed shooting is definitely not a strength; it's not recommended for birding unless you're comfortable being very persistent and are prepared to shoot A LOT, which is unacceptable to most birders. Indoor shooting is okay in most lighting conditions, though it struggles in low light. The flash is powerful for a pop-up, as with all cameras the learning curve for indoor shots is a bit steeper.

We did not want to jump into the DSLR arena, but wanted to get shots as-close-as-possible.  After painstakingly researching media and reviews for all of the latest models in this category, I couldn't pass up the deal on this Lumix FZ70.I have to say, I feel this camera is one of the best value purchases I've ever made.  First of all, the exterior fit, finish, and feel inspire immediate confidence, as the materials used and weightiness of the device exude quality.  Not chintzy at all.  I tested and compared the Canon SX50 in-store, and while that is also a very capable camera, the Lumix just feels and looks so much more high-quality in person.  Secondly, the ease of use and capability of taking great photos right out of the box, especially in iAuto mode was astonishing.  We were immediately taking awesome photos of our pets up close, and distant birds and squirrels out in the yard on full 60X zoom, with nice bokeh effect and great color and quality.  If the lighting outdoors leaves something to be desired, some of the quick post-processing effects can be implemented to immediately color-up, sharpen, brighten, etc to produce beautiful images with little effort.  Image stabilization is top-notch, as I have been able to take several long-zoom outdoor shots without a tripod with ease, just using simple technique tricks like using the viewfinder while bracing elbows against the body, etc.  Auto-focus is fast and accurate, burst shooting mode is also wonderful, as it greatly increases your odds of getting that perfect shot without any noticeable extra effort on your part.Although I know there are many reviews that nit-pick on various things such as indoor photo quality, my use of the camera indoors has produced very good results, with a nice flash that doesn't wash out pictures at all.  I feel that for the average user who wants to shoot photos above the capabilities of the average point-and-shoot that appear 'professional' to 95% of viewers, you can't go wrong with this camera.  I have an aging Canon PowerShot SD1100IS small handheld that has taken some amazing photos for me through the last several years, and this Lumix FZ70 with its amazing zoom capabilities is the perfect natural progression to the next level.  At this price point, you can't go wrong.

I was really hoping to test the Fuji with the dual mode focus.  What isn't in the published specs of the FZ-70 is that the FZ-70 has 200MB built in memory.  Used the Camera for holiday photos and all were great, and almost never used the flash because it wasn't necessary.  Speaking of the flash,  there is also undocumented, that the flash is indeed a pop-up, however it is a manual pop-up. meaning when it needs the flash it has a message in the view finder or the LCD screen to open the flash.  the Flash doesn't pop-up automatically when needed like other cameras.  The first time this happened, i was very tempted to take it back.  however i realized that when in a situation where i knew a flash may be needed, i could just open it up.  I have experimented with some of the special features while reading the manual.  let me say first off that it works great in full auto mode  iA mode.  however the special features are wondrous.  one i really like is the \"single color\" mode where you can take a photo of a person wearing a ball cap, and make the ball cap the only thing in color with the rest of the photo in BW.  The manual is huge, since there are so many capabilities of this camera.  I downloaded to may tablet and read a feature and try it on the camera.  this is going to be a long process.  Bottom line - i think the professional reviewers were paid by another company to push their camera, and am very glad i tested all of the contenders before purchasing.

If you aren't familiar with them, you might think of them as bigger than a standard compact camera, but without the changeable lenses and big sensors of DSLRs.  They are not just for poor photographers.  Their ability to go from macro (super close) to high zoom levels without a lens change is handy, and image quality is very good.  Even people with DSLRs sometimes keep one in their stash.So, how does the Lumix DMC-FZ70 compare?BUILDSome things never seem to change in electronics, and the standard build of this class of camera is one of them.  It looks very much like the rest.  Still, everything seems to fit together tightly and the housing is sturdy.  My one complaint is that the screen is not moveable.  I find the ability to swivel the screen on my Canon camera extremely useful (high shots, low shots, etc.).LOW LIGHTIt is not magical.  In low-light indoor situations, I needed a steady hand to avoid motion blur.  I took a series of identical shots with both cameras and found the the Lumix had vastly better low-light images, with more detail coming through.  While manual settings will give the best results, the auto settings were pretty intelligent.  It does not compare well with DSLRs that I've used, but that is an unfair comparison.  This is the best I've seen a superzoom do with standard indoor lighting.The flash is bright and good at not blowing out images.BRIGHT LIGHTWith daylight, images are beautiful and sharp.  Compared to the Canon, the colors are truer.  This is a matter of preference, as it may make some imagery less \"vivid.\"  Thankfully, this can easily be adjusted in photo editing software.One thing that DSLRs do great is bokeh (keep one part of image in focus, while rest is unfocused).  I was able to get a little bit, but nothing very impressive.  On the bright side, having everything in focus is usually ideal for family or documentary photos.ZOOMWow!  This camera goes from a super wide angle perfect for shooting in small rooms to zooming far away fast.  So fast that I found it a bit hard to get the zoom just right at first.  What a great and useful feature!MACROMacros are very impressive with the FZ70.  Even with the lens touching an object, I was able to get sharp focus.  This is one thing that a DSLR can't hope to do without an expensive lens just for it.VIDEOWow again!  I've taken a ton of video with this camera, and it is always impressive.  The processor is able to keep up with the 1080i video at 60 fps with no blur during pans or when recording fast objects.  As with photos, the low-light performance is impressive too.  The audio is not as impressive, but it does the job.  Focus is generally fast and able to keep up, and the use of zoom does not cause a loud motor noise like it does in my old camera.CONCLUSIONSThe Lumix DMC-FZ70 is a surprisingly good value.  It works well in low-light and takes videos worthy of all your family memories.

Since I tend to take a lot of photos indoor with poor illumination, some reviews I've read set my mind towards FZ70 and its 20mm wide.What I like:- 20mm wide: it allows me to cover a lot of width without having to step back much. My previous camera has 28mm and other cameras in this range has 24 or 25mm, tipically.- 1200mm tele: SX50 has the same ammount of tele, but my SX20 maxes at 560mm.- internal memory: not that I intend to run around without a SD card, but internal memory can be a life saver and it allowed for immediate photos after unpacking, since I didn't bought a new SD card (and my current one was very far).- easy to open battery compartment: my SX20 has a battery compartment that is a bit tricky to open. On FZ70, you just slide a switch and it opens. Closing is just as easy.- image quality: my main reason to upgrade. Of course, I fully expected a decent improvement since SX20 is a 2009 camera while FZ70 is 4 years newer. Still, it's quite noticeable when I looked at details while at 100% image size under low light.What I disliked:- Fixed lcd: SX20 has a variable angle lcd viewer (so does SX50), while FZ70 has a fixed one. I almost gave up on buying when I saw it didn't have a variable one, since it's so useful for selfies, seeing what is on it when the camera is too high or to low while mount on tripods and such.- Proprietary USB connector: while most cameras allow USB connection by providing a mini-usb port, Panasonic decided to go with something else and so you're stuck with their cables.- Battery: it was another factor that almost interfered with this choice. It's mostly personal preference, but I'd prefer if it used 4 AA batteries instead of a proprietary li-ion one. I use Sanyo Eneloops in my SX20 and have been happy with their duration (I can shoot 12h of video without needing to replace them). Also, I could buy some alcalines should necessity arises.- No lens hood: it's a pity there are no lens hood in the box. My SX20 came with one.

I've owned 4 super zoom cameras prior to this one so one would think each camera should be an improvement over the previous year's leader.  My first two purchases were Lumix models about 8 and 10 years ago...poor performance at the far ranges of their digital zooms due to stability systems that did not get the job done, subpar picture quality and panorama pictures which consisted of a rectangular aperture in the lens.  My next super zoom purchase was the Olympus SP 800UZ, which also had major stability issues at the far ranges of the zoom, rendering it almost unusable except for the mid-range shots and panorama shots which when stitched together looked uneven and worthless.  I bought the Nikon Coolpix P510 2 years ago and was  pleasantly surprised by it's performance.  Great panorama shots, no stability problems at the far ranges, and excellent quality shots.  The computer software that came with it was top notch.  Even came with GPS for geo-tagging photos.  Only problems were jerky poor quality videos that had to be \"enhanced\" using YouTube and autofocus problems with even midrange zoom photos and poor battery life.  The owners manual supplements the quick start booklet, but you'll need a separate carrying case to carry it around.  It's 226 pages long and took two hours to download and print from the CD, but if you want to utilize the camera to its full potential, you will need to bring it with you on photo shoots. There is no user guide on the camera, and the quick start booklet shows you the basics like how to charge the battery and attach the shoulder strap to the camera.  If you encounter an error message while taking shots you will have to refer to the owners manual for an explanation.  There were several other issues:  if you want to resize or crop the photo you've just taken, you must leave the date/time stamp function off.  Stamped photos cannot be edited in-camera, but they can be edited/enhanced using any basic online photo sharing sotware once downloaded on your computer. You could leave the time/date stamp function off, edit your photos and use the text stamp function to date/time stamp your photos. Unfortunately, this method will make a date stamped duplicate photo of every photo taken.  Take 100 photos and use this method and you end up with 200 total with 100 duplicates that have to manually deleted on your memory card.  Even my cheap Samsung wiil allow me to trim or enhance stamped photos in-camera.  Why would Panasonic force you to make a choice?  The good points for the FZ-70:  no stability problems encountered at the far ranges of the zoom.  Pictures taken using the various modes were far superior to the Nikon; much shorter time for the camera to autofocus on it's subject using the zoom (unless you attach a converter lens).  The in-camera editing features were much better than the Nikon and the quick retouch feature is easy to use.  I've had a chance to use the video function and the videos are HD and camcorder quality, far superior to the Nike's video recording abilities.  There is one feature not available on the Nike.  You can take still pictures while recording videos, however doing so will prevent you from using the telephoto function while shooting videos.  Just one more example of two steps forward whilw taking one step backward should you decide to purchase this camera.  The camera has a hot shoe to attach an optional flash, and if 1200 mm is insufficient zoom for you, an adapter and a 1.5x converter lens can get you even closer to your subject, but the owners manual states you may encounter focusing issues by doing so.

That is until, I got this one. My last camera is the DMC-FZ100. I wanted the upgraded zoom and megapixels. Let me say that the camera does have good points. The weight of the camera is a nice beefy feeling, and makes you aware that you have a camera in your hands. The zoom is INCREDIBLE! Wow,,,it almost breaks my heart to return it because the zoom is so amazing.There is a hot shoe for an external flash. That is about where my \"WOW factor\".Panasonic made a decision to leave items off of this camera items that had a GREAT purpose and now they are gone. Things like the tilt screen,,,the external MIC plug, the macro setting on the setting wheel is gone, and now must be found in the setting menu (it's easy to find, but it used to be easier to just turn the setting wheel). But the tilt screen gone? Why? Having a bridge camera is the reason why folks like me LOVE having a tilt screen. Most of us are amateur photographers, we LIKE the tilt screen! We don't want to manipulate the different lenses,,,many don't like having to mess with manual focus or settings to control many things. I for one like the ability to change my settings manually,,,but,,,I'm also only 5ft tall, I can't get many shots that taller folks can get. But, give me a tilt screen and I can hold the camera up in the air, tilt the screen down, and see what I want for a decent picture,,,that has been taken away.That being said,,,I could live with it when I saw the zoom ability! I loved it!!! I could see birds hiding in trees from quite a distance! WOW - I was a happy shutter bug! Then I started to use the camera. The zoom focus was sluggish and super slow (it was not supposed to be this way). I played around with the settings, and was hoping that this would change, it didn't. But, I dealt with it, and started taking pictures,,,the back screen was almost invisible in bright sunlight, so I switched to the view finder. Getting my full view was a bit difficult for me, but I got the shots that I wanted. It was a clear, bright sunny day, not a cloud in the sky and spring cherry tree blooms were screaming for their picture to be taken. Out of 128 pictures taken from my walk, over half had to be deleted. This was an anomaly that had never taken place in my photoshop menu before. The ones that I did keep, all had to be manually adjusted for clarity. I was upset. I had such high expectations for this model camera. I was willing to give up certain items, in a swap for that awesome zoom capability, but the quality that was lacking in the photos themselves, was just not worth it. Many people have raved at this model, and the pictures that it takes. Perhaps I just got a bad camera? I don't know. I cannot be sure. And, I'm not willing to take that chance. I will be waiting for a different brand camera, to arrive on the market place in March. It will cost much more, but, at this point, I'd rather spend more money, and get everything that I want in a camera.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "The good, the bad...and the average", "Author": "William Moore", "ReviewID": "R2MDNYISNNXX0R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For a light weight digital camera it is good for some events and not so much for others.  I've only had this camera for a month as a backup to my higher end cameras.  From the lower zoom to about the 500 mm zoom the photos are good when shot in RAW (JPG starts to get fuzzy and grainy early in the 30x zoom range and because I take a lot of nature and landscape photos the 500 to 1200 (60x range) the photos quality diminishes. I'm comparing the quality with higher-end DSLR cameras/lens and that might not be fair since this is not promoted as comparable. Close up and objects not more than 100-150 feet the camera is good.  I would not recommend this camera if you are looking for overall great optics and low pixelation (the effect caused by zooming in on a photo making pixels visible). Shooting in the RAW mode does help however it uses up a lot of memory and battery (fewer photos on a memory card and battery drainage).  I've been shooting since the early 1970 (film) and digital higher end DSLR's from the very early 2000's.

I wanted a bridge camera that had a longer zoom than my fz200, didn't break the bank and was small and light enough to actually keep with me.  At 60x, fz70 has almost twice the optical zoom of my fz200 and I can still use the doubling lens I bought for the fz200 once I purchase an adapter if I need more than a 1200mm zoom.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fz200, the low light capabilities of the fz70 doesn't compare but the 60x zoom is nothing short of amazing.  The picture quality is fine for my needs (snapshots, travel photos, birding shots) and the camera is light enough to keep in my backpack.  I am a novice birder and the ability to get a decent picture of a bird a good distance away is helping me learn to id what I was missing before.  I am more than happy with this camera.Pros:- Did I mention it has a 60x optical zoom?- Small enough to keep with me.  Can't get great pics if the camera is sitting at home.- Picture quality is decent.  Not as good as the fz200 but you don't pay as much for this camera either.Cons:- Battery life.  Not great.  Can be extended by dimming the screen and turning off the setting to keep the focus motor going.- File name conflicts.  Since I own two Panasonic cameras I have to be creative when importing photos.  There is no way to alter the file naming convention of PXXXXXXX.JPG so it is easy to overwrite files if both cameras are being used.  There is a site online that tells how to jump ahead in the numbering schema but that is just putting off the problem.

After reading a lot of the reviews on Amazon and other places on the web, as well as watching too many You Tube videos, I came to the conclusion that the FZ70 would be a good, affordable  replacement for my aging 35mm Cannon SLR.  Now I\u2019m not sure I read and watched enough.  After it arrived in a timely fashion, I set about playing with my new toy. You know- local landscapes, the cat, my wife, shots taken indoors and out, cloudy and sunny days. Hand-held and on a tripod. It is lightweight and compact given that huge piece of glass on the front. It comes with everything you need to start except a case and SD card. But the best I can give this camera is 3 stars.  First, there is no remote shutter release system available for this camera. While there are enough automatic modes and settings to keep you busy learning until the unit is obsolete and it has to be replaced, the manual mode settings are limited. Tech support is rather lackluster. It took them 45 minutes to answer one question, including the time it took them to give me the answer to a question someone else asked. The basic paper manual you receive with the camera is difficult to follow and it (along with the \u201cAdvanced Manual\u201d you can download from the Panasonic website) is more concerned with taking video than stills.  It takes \u201cOK\u201d photos- good but the color and focus never seems quite correct, especially when taking pictures that require a long depth of field. I also can\u2019t notice much effect using their stabilization system. I can most closely compare them to a $150 dollar pocket camera.  I can\u2019t return it because I am leaving for the Grand Canyon next week and will not have time.  While disappointed, I guess I have no one to blame but myself. I just don\u2019t know how much more research I could have done.

Lionel", "ReviewID": "RVGH27NM4XP97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My usual style of camera is the \"semi-pro\" DSLR - I have a Canon 7D. Otherwise I go for small, pocketable cameras such as the Canon PowerShot S90. The Panasonic DMC-FZ70 is a camera style I have not tried before: lightweight, crammed full of features, significant manual controls and extreme zoom capabilities. I took it with me on a trip to a family event to see how it would shake out.I am not going to try to list every feature the DMC-FZ70 has, I'd be here all day. But here are the things that appealed to me:- Full manual controls available, including aperture and shutter priority modes- RAW image capability- Hot shoe for external flash- Separate button to start video recording - no need to \"switch modes\"- 60X optical zoom with optical stabilization- Enough control buttons and dials to satisfy a DSLR lover- Built-in panorama stitchingI used the DMC-FZ70 for both video and stills, and was very favorably impressed with the quality of each. I separately bought a PNY 64GB SDXC card which worked just fine. Curiously, the camera has 200MB of built-in storage, so it can take some photos and even short videos without a card. I selected MP4 as the video recording format because I thought that's what I would need for YouTube, though I later learned that the AVCHD mode, which is default, would have worked better. The videos were clear and smooth, and the recorded audio was just fine, with just a hint of wind noise. A wind noise suppression mode is available. There is a \"zoom mic\" mode that will, supposedly, allow you to record sounds from further away when zoomed out - I did not try that.Even though I often choose custom settings on my DSLR, I left the DMC-FZ70 in \"AI\" mode because I didn't want to distract myself from the events I was recording. This worked just fine, and I don't think I would have changed anything. Even in this mode, you can make minor adjustments such as depth-of-field and exposure compensation.I was very impressed with how far out the camera could zoom - even more is available if you want to get into digital zoom (which I avoid). The optical stabilization worked quite well, though at maximum zoom you're really going to want a tripod.I also tried the panorama mode, where you hold down the shutter button and swivel around as it takes many pictures and then stitches them together. This worked fine. I also used the self-timer feature to take a group photo (on a tripod).Is there anything about the DMC-FZ70 I didn't like? Yes. The supplied lens cap doesn't grip very well, but at least it's tethered. Going on the advice of another reviewer, I bought a third-party lens cap (and also a Sigma UV filter, which I put on all my lenses.) In addition to the crisp 3\" display, there is an electronic viewfinder, but you have to switch between them.The Panasonic DMC-FZ70 is lightweight, compact and easy to carry. I can easily see myself taking this places I wouldn't take my DSLR. It would make a great vacation camera as a step up from a typical point-and-shoot, and has enough manual controls to satisfy all but the most die-hard DSLR fan.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive camera has amazing zoom feature.", "Author": "Donald L.

Weissberg", "ReviewID": "R2JY0HB5MKNBK3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I so much wanted this product to perform well. I like Panasonic cameras for many reasons. I own many.Many other reviews explore the virtues of this camera. As a photographer I want the camera to perform consistently. Focus and image stabilization should perform securely for the lens provided with the camera. I experienced random results with both the focus and lens stabilization at its 60X optical performance. Why have a lens which will not perform consistently handheld as it was intended to be used?Exposure should remain consistent through all automatic settings, Program, IA Auto, IA Auto Plus, Scene modes, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, The shutter and aperture may vary but the exposure should remain consistent. I did NOT experience this during my testing under the same lighting conditions.A smart bridge camera being used for this area between Point and Shoot and DSLR, should evaluate the position of the lens when considering exposure. If Sport recognizes the shutter should be set for 1/500th of a second with the lighting conditions and a lens at 60X optical, then all the auto functions should recognize that the lens extended to 60X optical requires 1/500th to capture an image without blur. This speed is inconsistent ranging from 1/125th to 1/500th of a second with the exact same lighting conditions. Perhaps engaging a beta testing photographer could have alerted the engineering staff of these inconsistencies before Panasonic brought this product into production.Most bridge users want raw image capability. Usually bridge camera users post process their images if they shoot raw. The software products bridge users employ for post processing are usually common and are capable of using plug-ins to extend the capacity to this software. Lightroom as I understand does not identify nor is able to use the FZ70 / 72 raw file. If i were a manufacturer, I would ensure the consumers of my product would be able to use my raw files universally in common software for their convenience. I checked the latest DNG release at Adobe, and their DNG converter did not support this camera. I am not aware that Panasonic has provided a raw file that is easily used.IA Plus auto mode. Why be able to adjust the IA Plus if the settings are not retained for future use? Fortunately, most of the scene modes allow this feature.I like the size and ergonomics of this camera. Buttons, Menus and controls are logically place.This a rough gem that has not been made into a jewel.The sensor appears to perform well to 1600 ISO with usable files for most purposes.I would like to encourage we Panasonic users to encourage Panasonic to develop a less noisy sensor instead of getting into the mega pixel race. 35 mm film resolved at approximately 8 megapixel. So a camera sensor at 16 megapixels is certainly sufficient for most of our purposes.The sensor in this camera seems to be less noisy than the 12 megapixel sensor in the FZ200. A marriage of these products would be a bridge camera gem.This is my non professional opinion. I am hopeful a better bridge product will be forthcoming from Panasonic. If not I'll have to explore the replacement for the Canon SX50, a camera with some shortcomings but with a usable raw file. Raw files are essential because jpeg wastes so much information when the image is saved. Raw files have to be able to be read by MAC or WINDOWS computers as well as software that these computers commonly use.Happy shopping. Sadly,my camera has to go back because it did not perform to my expectations. I'll have to see if something is offered in the bridge camera arena this Spring.

I'm not going to repeat what others already wrote, but I wanted to add a few things:1. Panasonic is using a strange folders naming on the SD card where the video clips are hiding. It reminds me Sony. Never understood why it is needed to have the video clips (which are MTS files and not AVI, MOV or whatever you saw before) buried three levels down in the card.2. When the camera is turned ON, there is a strange noise that never stops but increases when the lens is extended. If you place your ear above the Mic, you can hear it well... When you switch the mode to Play, the noise goes away. It is there always and only when the camera is in capturing mode... all modes.3. The Flash shoe, as nice as it may be, does not work with all mountable flashes. I tried the Nikon SB600 and no joy. When I press the shutter button to take a picture, the flash resets and recharges, but there is no flash light... So the shutter causes the short to tell the flash to reset, but not receiving the command to fire it, strange.4. The lack of a lens hood is an issue, especially when you have a lot of light using the zoom. I found a rubber hood with a 55mm thread outside (that fits to the camera thread) and 55mm inside, so you can attach a filter to protect the lens. Of course, found it here on Amazon.I've added a few images of a mountain and cactus using the different zoom settings. You can find those images at the Users Gallery above.Although I have a few minor issues with the camera, I still gave it 5 stars because the number of features that are built into this body and the X60 zoom are just remarkable. I use a DSLR full time and adding this lens in a shape of a camera, as much as there is a difference between the two, is a great way to be more mobile.

In Zooms beyond 200 you need a tripod, using the Panasonic in ~600nn zoom, it was hard to stay on the object, the Samsung with 50-200mm with 2x digital zoom, and 1.5x factor, was much easier to use.I graded the Panasonic with  3 stars, as it is reasonably priced for whatever you get. For $200 (or less) more The NX 2000 with 2 lenses is a better deal.The problem is that when you take a photo, and you want to get the best results, and the image is not good, sometimes you can not duplicate that moment.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice camera for the money", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "RGT11ZRMRJVZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Still need to learn how to use all the features but so far we like it.

I still have lots more testing to do in this area however.  The 20mm wide shots are amazing. My FZ150 has a 25mm wide and this camera appears to take in approx. 20% more coverage. I was able to shoot at max zoom and get good results hand holding the camera. This was in bright sunlight so with less light I wouldn't expect such good results. I really dislike the on/off switch. Hard to move and feels like it will break easily. On the physical positive side the shape of the grip is excellent. The palm of your hand makes full contact with the camera. Much better than my FZ150. I also like the slightly raised Video button and its location. I can find it by feel now. The wheel on the back of the FZ70 is a huge improvement over the one on the FZ150. It sticks out more now and is easy to turn. I've only had the camera in my hands since yesterday and will add more impressions as I get deeper into it but except for the lousy on/off switch I'm quite impressed at this point.Here's my update.After quite extensive testing comparing the zooms on my FZ150 with the FZ70 I decided to return the FZ70. I can crop the shots taken with the FZ150 to equal the reach of the FZ70 and I actually like the results from the FZ150 better. I tired various settings on both cameras so I'd be comparing apples with apples as close as possible. The big attraction for me with the FZ70 was the extra zoom but if I can get the same IQ cropping my FZ150 shots that cancels out the main advantage of the FZ70 for me.  Also I found I really missed the articulated LCD that the FZ150 has.  I will miss the 20mm wide angle and the great grip on the FZ70. I won't miss that terrible ON/OFF switch on the FZ70.  I feared every time I moved that switch it was going to break. I loved the wheel and Video button on the FZ70 however. Hey, I won't have to buy an LA8 adaptor tube to attach my Olympus TCON 1.7X lens to this FZ70 now.  Cheers everybody, I'll still be following your comments.

The Sony mentioned below has been incredible, taking great shots and creating wonderful images all in a compact package.  I would definitely recommend skipping this Panasonic for something else.Original review:The FZ70 seemed really exciting on paper, but in reality the picture quality was disappointing.  Images were frequently washed out and had a soft appearance.  About one in ten photos was acceptable, a problem compounded by the fact this was hard to determine until the photos were downloaded and viewed on the computer.  As far as the zoom lens, most of the zoom range was unattainable with handheld use.  Even in full sun there was significant blur.  Zoomed in, the washed out look became even more pronounced.On a bright note, the camera did take good indoor shots with nice color and flash distribution.  Subjects were rarely washed out by the flash.  Focus was also relatively fast.I had the FZ70 for about a week and decided to return it for the Sony DSC-HX50V/B 20.4MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD Screen (Black).  I've had the Sony for a day and already I prefer the Sony in almost every way.

It was great. When the FZ 35 came out the following year, I bought it. It was much better than the 28. I was thrilled to get the increased zoom and mega pixels when the FZ 40 arrived, and the image quality continued to be outstanding, although fewer images were keepers which I attributed to the difficulty of controlling hand-shake at the larger zoom factor. I have purchased new cameras in the line every year since, and have returned all of them with great sadness after trying and failing to produce images that were even close to satisfactory, especially when compared to those taken with the earlier models. I suspect that the problem lies in the difference between CCD and CMOS sensors, although the FZ 47 was a CCD model and it was no better and much worse than the FZ 40. I am sure there are other features, video for example, that are better in the new models. However, if high-resolution, sharp, clear images that capture the beauty of nature in its most realistic rendering is a priority for you, as it is for me, your best bet is to by a used FZ 40, or a FZ 35. I have purchased 4 of the former and 2 of the latter as I am coming to the painful conclusion that Panasonic has abandoned the high-quality image business. I would switch to another manufacturer if I could find one that offered standard threads on their high-end point-and-shoot cameras.As unhappy as I have been returning the cameras, I am very impressed and grateful to Amazon for their incredibly generous and pleasant customer service.

NOWHERE does Panasonic mention this. You need to download SilkyPix (for free) BUT WHOAAAA...it is SOOOOOO difficult it put me in tears. There is no export button, I took an hour to look for export or even SAVE ....NOTHING. I figured how to convert to tiff (thinking iPhoto would recognize that) and I think it saved....BUT TO WHERE???? There is no option to save to a folder, or the desktop.Forget the Silkypix manual. If you are proficient w Photoshop this might be okay..but I am not. I want a user friendly camera and user friendly iphoto to process my photos. I want raw to save to the external hard drive... but with this program it is IMPOSSIBLE. You have to telephone JAPAN!!!! For goodness sake Panasonic. The software is a \"DEVELOPER'S TOOL\"!!!! Really????? As a 'bridge' camera, this is for non-professionals....so the software needs to be user friendly.And Panasonic free 800 tech support is just as worthless. He said I needed to contact Apple if iPhoto didn't recognize raw2. As it is ONLY panasonic that uses it, it should be panasonic to supply a user friendly photo processing, NOT this JUNK!! And really, the Silkypix manual is as difficult as the program..NOWHERE does the manual explain how to save to desktop. NOT AT ALL! The directions looses much in translation.If raw is important to you, and yu have a mac, keep this in mind. I am truly thinking of sending this back. The absolute lack of support is troubling!I have added the following to CNET reviews of this camera...I hope you find it helpful.I bought this camera and LOVE it. Sharp, retina colors..just beautiful BUT the raw is misleading. It is raw2, which is proprietary to Panasonic, and for a Mac user , iPhoto  does a \"unreadable files\". So contacted the 800 number and Panasonic rep was useless...told me to contact Apple! REALLY! So tried again w online chat and was told needed to download Silkypix, free and for Mac. WOW...unless your a tech 'geek' this software is sooooooo difficult it left me in tears.  The Silkypix manual, looses a great deal in translation and is like the program..a \"developers tool\"! It is toooo difficult to read and understand. All I wanted to do is take one of the raw2  files, convert to Tiff so I could use in iPhoto or Aperture.  Learned how to convert..BUT no Export button, no save button..no way to export to external  desktop folder and I still can't find the photo I converted. Was so upset deleted program and sent a very angry letter to Silkypix and Panasonic.So if raw is important to you and you use a Mac, you better be VERY knowledgeable in technical terms  or Photoshop because this is way too difficult for an ordinary person to understand. I don't use Photoshop because I find it  difficult to use. I am not a professional photographer, and this is a 'bridge' camera...so Panasonic needs to get rid of Silkypix and use a \"user friendly\" program or get rid of raw2 and use raw.As for the adaptors, they are available on Panasonic's website and Amazon. I did but a uv filter to attach to protect the lens, and other accessories. The video in 1080 is wonderful and I just love this camera, especially for the $358 price I paid on Amazon (plus free shipping and no tax!) BUT I have been taught by my friends at the photo club to always have raw files, and not just jpeg. So I have an external hard drive I keep all my photos on. As I get better at the software I can go back to the raw and process better, but for now it is a steep learning curve for me.

My \"disappointment\" is due to the fact that this model DOES NOT HAVE A LEICA LENS. This was the great selling point of their cameras. I have four (4) of them, all \"basic\" point and shoot. I have been an amateur photographer for 35 or so years....have seen and used various brands/styles, film (slides and prints, different kinds of films) and digital. Also have Pentax, Nikon, Kodak cameras (SLRs and P&S;).Panasonic stands out as an superb camera. So much so, I generally use my point and shoot far more than my SLR (unless taking pictures of birds). Having a Leica lens makes it the Cadillac of point and shoots. I primary do landscape/birds. Many of my birding friends who have them...when doing work where the object isn't so \"flighty\" (!)or far away ...love their Panasonics. BUT....without a Leica lens, I'm sorry. It's just another camera. They were going to release this model back in June of this year, without a viewfinder (a problem for me) but it stil had a Leica lens. For some reason they never actually released it, and then around August it came out again, with a viewfinder but not a Leica lens. Go figure.If you look at their web site for this model, the original version is still showing with Leica on the lens at the beginning of the description, but the current version is used in the remainder of the description and there's no Leica name on the lens.After reading other reviews, I contacted Panasonic to verify. The guy I talked to had no clue. He went online to check. Duh. I already did that and then some. Insulting, to say the least. He verified the FZ60 has the Leica lens, but it \"appeared\" the FZ70 did not. Gee, thanks for wasting my time.Bottom line, whatever camera, in my book it isn't the camera itself....it's the lens.
