It appears to be focused about an inch in front of the mount plane. (I.E., if I hold the mount about an inch off the camera the image is sharp.) If I can't correct this somehow I will seek to return it.  I do like the mount scheme in that it does not require me to glue something to the camera. The screw-on mount seems to work well, and the magnetic hood mounts firmly. It's just that the image is not sharp.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$45.99", "Features": "One (1) viewfinder with an eye cup and magnifying lens\nOne (1) magnetic mounting bracket\n2.8X LCD Screen Viewfinder\nTwo elements optical glass design.
