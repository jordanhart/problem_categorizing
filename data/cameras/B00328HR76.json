The features that really made me decide to buy this camera were:1. AVCHD 1080i FULL QUALITY video. Check the bitrate -- it's the same as the camcorders. Better than the flip or handheld 'HD' bitrates2. Wide Picture Stitching. I am astounded by the quality of these pictures. Dumbfounded. Check out the ones I've posted.3. GPS Tagging. Yep- been waiting for this since iPhoto introduced the feature into its software.4. Low-light performance. For a point-and-shoot, you're not going to beat this. Sure, it's no DSLR, but it's pretty great for the price.5. Price- a zillion features and a totally reasonable price!!!Mac Compatibility:I tried out the camera with iMovie, and it worked seamlessly!!! I imported 2 minutes of low-light video footage AVCHD in about 30 seconds from an SDHC Class-6 card. Also used the camera with iPhoto and Aperture, and everything worked great.Update: I've had time to play around with the different settings -- you can see some of my results in the customer uploaded images. The panoramas today came out great! I am still awed by this feature (amazon's tiny photos don't do it justice). Shooting inside in the MOMA was excellent. Outside, I tried the HDR mode, with limited success (still need to experiment, but see what I got). The handheld twilight mode does what it is supposed to, impressively.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony HX5V/B Review - Best Point and Shoot On The Market", "Author": "Oldtech 45", "ReviewID": "R38LY8TW1VHLER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*****Pros: Clear, Crisp pictures & movies.

In fact many of the complaints I read were by people comparing the camera with high end SLR?s or DSLR?s clearly not an unbiased or practical test, in my opinion a device should be compared with products in the same class to be fair.*Store and Professional Reviews:I spoke to most of the major and many other camera stores that carried various brands that were familiar with this camera all of them stated they did not have a point and shoot better than this camera. Some stated the camera was as good as some SLR?s and some pointed out the lens and the CMOS image sensor was the same as that found on high end DSLRs.My Test Results:*****Indoor Camera mode: Camera tested in the Auto mode, photographed people and pets ? Tested under natural light, incandescent and fluorescent lights all shots were clear and sharp. Camera Tested in a darkened room in Auto mode flash worked picture quality was excellent. Extreme test - Camera tested in an almost completely dark room with light seeping through a window blind, picture blurry -camera had trouble adjusting due to streaks of light coming through blind. Repeated test without sunlight comming through blind in the dark camera worked excellent but I had to use \"Easy\" mode instead of Auto. It pays to try the cameras different modes.*****Outdoor Camera Mode - Camera tested in Auto mode; photographed people and pets pictures were clear and sharp. The camera compensated for my movements, people moving and animal movement even when using zoom at its maximum without a tripod. Photographed a man made waterfall you could actually see the water streaming down the rock. Photographed several high trees all came out straight, even a palm tree. Tested camera at sunset and at night to get the best results you need to learn the cameras mode.*****Movie Mode: (Inside and Outside)Photographed people and animals playing inside and outside, a man made waterfall, a television program. Camera adjusted to my movements and gave clear and crisp movies. Sounds were accurate and clear.*****Viewing:The camera has a 3 inch LCD display; I had no problem seeing what I photographed even in sunlight.*****Software:The camera includes software that allows you to save your pictures as data, WMV, HD and standard mode. All modes worked well.Conclusion: As far as I am concerned this camera is better than any point and shoot on the market. I agree with a lot of the professionals that stated it was almost as good as a SLR or DSLR when used by the average user. Even in the Auto mode it excelled in many difficult situations both as a fixed camera and movie camera. Due to the camera size you have to be careful not to block the microphone on the top of the camera. If you are a professional photographer this camera is probably not for you though I did talk to one professional photographer that stated they used this camera as a backup at a wedding and the pictures came out as good as their high end cameras in many situations.*****Cost: I managed to find the camera on sale at [...] for $293.99 when buying 2 accessories @ 15% off.*****Below are some of the camera specifications to see them all you can go to [...].* Optical Zoom : 10x* Total Zoom : Approximately 20x with Precision Digital Zoom Macro Mode : iAuto(W:Approx.5cm(0.16')* Drive Mode : Normal / Hi-Speed Burst (High/Mid/Low) / Bracketing* Shutter Speeds : iAuto(2\" - 1/1,600) / Program Auto(1\" - 1/1,600) /Manual(30\"-1/1600)* Aperture : iAuto(F3.5/F8.0(W)) / Program Auto(F3.5/F8.0(W)) / Manual(F3.5/F8.0(W)) (2 Steps with ND Filter)* ISO : Auto / 125 / 200 / 400 / 800 / 1600 / 3200* Focal Length (35mm equivalent) : 4.25-42.5mm* AF Modes : 9 points AF / Center Weighted AF / Spot AF* Burst Mode : Approx 10 fps at 10.2MP (Maximum 10 shots)* HD Output : HDMI / Component (1080i)* Flash Modes : Auto / On / Slow Syncro / Off* White Balance Mode: Auto / Daylight / Cloudy / Fluorescent / Incandescent / Flash.* Image Stabilization : Optical* Imaging Sensor : 1/2.4\" (7.59mm) \"Exmor R\" CMOS Sensor* Processor : BIONZ?* LCD Type : 3.0\"1 Clear Photo LCD (230K pixels)* Lens Type : Sony G-Lens (same as DSLR's)* Scene Mode(s) : High Sensitivity / Twilight / Twilight Portrait / Soft Snap / Landscape / Beach / Snow / Fireworks / Advanced Sports / Gourmet / Pet", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "C. Pak", "ReviewID": "R15HUZ0D3YVZ3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm comparing this camera to my most recent camera: Canon SD1000 and Sony TX1.  I'm just a casual photographer.  The most surprising thing about this camera is the weight. If you've owned some high end Sony or Canon PowerShot cameras then holding this camera doesn't \"feel\" normal, it's way too light for it's size...but that's a good thing....sort of.  They achieve this weight reduction by using plastic for many of the body parts (the SD1000 and TX1 are mostly, if not all metal).  The back is definitely plastic, I'm not quite sure about the front.  The mode dial (although very welcome) feels cheap.That's about it for the bad news. The good news is the GPS locks FAST out of the box and the picture quality is very good, on par with 10-12 mega-pixel cameras. The Sony \"extra\" features such as panorama and 1080 HD video work as advertised and add value to the Sony versus the only current competitor (with GPS and a mega-zoom) the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 which has not been released yet.  You can compare images between the two cameras on the Imaging Resource site as well as some others.I'm was going to purchase both this camera and the Panasonic to see which one I liked better, however I'm going to be keeping the Sony. I'm very happy with the ease of use, picture quality and the Sony extra features (such as panorama).For a case, I'm using the Case Logic TBC302. It fits the camera perfectly with barely enough room in the front pocket to hold a spare battery.  The Case Logic TBC303 is much larger but not too useful, for example you can't put the battery charger with the camera.  It could hold some credit cards or papers, though.Update: SoftwareI usually never install the included software because it's so bloated or just not very good to use.  However, the Sony PMB (which is on a CDROM or on the internal camera memory when plugged into your computer) is VERY good.  Good in that it's not bloated and it just works.  You can do everything you expect such as organize and edit your photos or even update/assign GPS data.  Also you can download updated GPS data (which helps the camera lock to GPS faster).  I would dare say the software is nicer than Picasa or iPhoto due to the speed and built in GPS features.  Some other things you can do but I have not tried yet: you can burn a video DVD (either a normal DVD or a AVCHD DVD with 1080i quality, but you need a PS3 or compatible player to watch those).Update: GPSI'm happy to report the GPS function works very well. I took a drive while snapping pictures as a test and then examined the recorded locations. The location was being actively updated because it was able to differentiate my position between shots taken seconds apart going about 40 MPH.  Very pleased.Update: Picture QualityOn closer inspection, the picture quality is a bit soft..I wish I could have the camera automatically adjust the sharpening inside the camera (make it more sharp) but this is not a big deal as the PMB software has easy edit controls.  You can also manually unsharp after you take the photograph. The low light performance is remarkable, especially the low-light modes that actively combine multiple images (hand-held twilight and back-light HDR modes do this). As long as you're steady and you're not shooting a moving subject you can get some pretty remarkable, low-noise images at night.Other final comment: when you turn the camera off, there is a slight delay (fraction of a second) before the lens retracts.  Not really an issue but just something I'm not used to with my previous cameras and something I just noticed as I'm usually taking quick impromptu photos, on..photo...off.  The interface, although totally functional, is not as \"refined\" as on my Sony TX1 (with touch screen), the LCD resolution is noticeably lower but, again, totally functional.The mode dial is still bugging me, I feel it's the first thing on this camera that will go...But only time will tell.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony hx5v - conveniences and function are overcome by poor image quality", "Author": "Rick in Virginia", "ReviewID": "R2VQXLIYJJQOGE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a new P&S; for a while and compared the Sony hx5v v. Canon sx210is v. Panasonic zs3 (as a prelude to the zs7). The most important consideration was image quality - followed closely by convenience, a well defined menu system, lens quality, fit and finish and pocketability. The Sony and Panny both had a gps function which was not important to me.The panny zs3 had poor low light performance and no manual controls. Several bona fide review sites stated that the IQ for the zs7 was inferior to the zs3 so I quickly made a decision that the zs7 was not in contention.For a comparison between the Sony and Canon I spent lunchtime on a couple of days walking around town - taking only photos with the Sony on the trip out...and with the Canon on the walk back to my office. With the same drill in the evening to compare low light performance. I accumulated several hundred photos. When taking the photos I would use whatever mode or camera setting was appropriate at the time. Specifically, I did not set the cameras on Auto and just shoot in that mode. I also took a fair amount of video. A couple of days later I loaded all photos and video onto my computer and began viewing and this is where the Sony fell down. The images were very soft. At a small size they looked fine - in fact they looked very good. However, with any magnification, the in-camera noise removal processing was evident and very heavy handed. Other review sites stated this, but I had to see it for myself, and even at ISO 125 (the lowest Sony allows) the images were soft. At pixel peeping levels it was very bad. Details were lost and it all looked like plastic. And if the details aren't there, no amount of work in PS or LR will bring them back to life. The evidence of noise at magnification was low, but I'd rather have native noise and remove it with Neat Image than be stuck with an over processed image. Also, there is no manual mode at all...all auto function. There is no iris for f-stop control, so to limit light Sony has chosen to use a neutral density filter and you get only 2 f-stops. Therefore, you get one depth of field for all images. That is almost anti-camera to me.Sony claims their CMOS sensor is superior to a CCD sensor. That is apparent in the ability to shoot full resolution images for 10 fps bursts, as well as the hand held twilight and anti blur modes. But, to my eye, I don't see any low light benefit of the CMOS over the CCD and image quality did not compare well, though I don't think that had much to do with the sensor as much as Sony's noise algorithm.The white balance is inconsistent indoors. You can get a custom WB by shooting a white object, but the native AWB will leave you disappointed. Outdoors the colors are warm - no problem there. And it is easy to use anti blur mode to get a quick snapshot anytime and have a good result.I did not give the video an adequate review since the stills were so disappointing. However, the microphones are situated in the exact wrong location. It is difficult to keep from covering one or both of them as you are filming. It is a very poor design. The flash is weak and poorly located - it is easy to block with your fingers. The light from the flash falls visibly off-centered in the image.The Sony has some great technology. The 10 fps burst is great, the hand held twilight and anti blur are clever and practical. The menu system is well designed and intuitive. It is a good point and shoot camera for someone that wants only that without the need for printing beyond 4x6 or only for casual viewing on the computer.The Sony was returned and the Canon sx210is won out. Far better image quality, it has a manual mode with up to 15 second exposure, very good HD video at 720p and good sound, superior low light performance, better flash power as well as being able to adjust the eV +/- for flash photography, better color gamut, the 14x optical on the Canon is nice - some vignetting at 14x, but that is fixable in post process. I do wish the Canon had a faster burst mode.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera,...not for everybody.", "Author": "D. Pierce \"pierce324\"", "ReviewID": "R26PMEWAHNDSC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the HX5V since I replaced my Canon SD800IS in March, '10 and have been very pleased with what it has to offer. It captures great images but with a caveat. It is not, strictly, a point and shoot. It has features such as the hand-held twilight, anti motion blur and iPanorama that take some knowledge and practice to make the most of. Most of the complaints I have read here relate to a misunderstanding of the camera features and not a failure in design. I'll address some of the the issues and how I have avoided or dealt with them.Colors: Most compact digital cameras come with auto-ISO and auto white-balance as the defaults. I always over-ride the auto-ISO with the lowest ISO setting and adjust manually from there if needed. Auto WB is left on, but virtually no current camera will decipher the odd mix of light that compact fluorescent lighting puts out. That's why there is a custom WB setting. When custom white-balance is used properly, colors are rendered nicely. In daylight, I have had no problems and under incandescent outdoor lighting it seems to render colors quite well.Distortion: Most P&S; cameras don't start out at 24mm equivalent on the wide end (one of the reasons that I bought the camera). If you are not used to composing using a wider-angle lens, your shots can produce some perspective distortion. Buildings and interiors need to be shot carefully at wide angles to minimize the \"leaning walls\" effect caused by the exaggerated perspective of wide angle lenses that is often mistaken for lens distortion. The lens itself is remarkably free of distortion at both the wide and long end of the zoom range. BTW, people shot up close with a wide-angle lens will NOT like how they look!Lack of detail: The HX5V is not a DSLR. Its 10MP files will never support the detail that you can get with a large APS-C sensor. If you are obsessed with detail and like to view your pictures in minute detail at 100% zoom with your nose 12 inches away from your monitor, this is not the camera for you. That said, it will fit in your pocket and produce sharp, detailed images suitable for 8x10 prints or even larger...if used properly. Auto-ISO will automatically boost ISO in low-light conditions. As stated before, this camera is a compact, not a DSLR. Though it does better at ISO 800 than most, it still has a tiny sensor that is susceptible to noise and the accompanying loss of detail from noise reduction processing at higher ISO. In low light, I have used the hand-held twilight function with excellent results. This mode isn't magic and if the camera moves too much during the multiple exposures, it won't do the job. If you choose your subject well and keep the camera steady, the images in this mode can be very impressive. Digital zoom can cause problems at the long end. Since this feature simply takes a smaller center section of the image and blows it up, resolution suffers.  I'm happy with the 10x optical zoom and turning off the \"digital zoom\" option prevents its use and accidental image degradation.iPanorama doesn't work: Nonsense. It is actually one of the best in-camera panorama solutions out there. Like everything else, there is no free lunch. You have to practice moving the camera steadily and smoothly across the scene and keep in mind that since it is using the video mode to capture the 100 or so image slices, you are limited to a 1080 pixel tall image (unless you trick it and use the vertical mode sideways to get a 1920 tall panorama).In general, the HX5V will function as a point and shoot camera but to get the most out of its remarkable feature set, you need to take the time to learn the functions and how to best take advantage of what they have to offer. It is not a camera for everyone but it can be a great 24x7, take-anywhere tool with some class-leading features if use it well.I have posted some images on my share site with examples of low-light, indoor, outdoor, panorama and extremes of the zoom range.You can find them at: Well I guess you'll have to take my word for it. Whenever I post the link, Amazon moderators strip it out. Since there are no ads at the site I can't imagine they are fearing revenue loss to my humble competition. Look up the images gallery at Digital Photography Review for examples(a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon). I'd post the link...but it might be removed by a moderator that doesn't know that they own DPReviewYou can run a full-screen slide show of the images there as well.If you want a great compact camera with a load of useful features and are willing to do some of the homework necessary to get the most out of it, the HX5V is an excellent choice.

Excellent results!", "Author": "Mark Crandell", "ReviewID": "R3GQTIMVBMADZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has loads of useful features and takes good looking photos.GPS + compass lets you see where you were and what direction you were pointing when taking photos. Works with the supplied photo browser software and others like Picasa 3. Only problem with GPS is that after you power on the camera some of you photos will be tagged with the previous location while the GPS tries to update the location. GPS can be as quick as 15 seconds, but depends on cloud coverage, the number of surrounding buildings, etc.Some of the other features I've found useful after only a few days.HDR mode - combines 2 back-to-back images and merges them giving you more dynamic range in the photo.Anti blur mode - merges 6 shots into 1 to help eliminate motion blur.Panorama stitch - great for cityscape/scenery. (Only works on the wide angle lens, no zooming allowed)25mm lens - great for indoor shots with lots of people.Face detection - easy to focus on people, smile detector makes capturing good shots automatic and helps when trying to take self portraits.1080i AVCHD capture. (Yes, you can zoom while taking video)SDHC/SD/Memory stick compatible, takes either of those memory cards.(Finally Sony!!)As far as the camera body goes, it is pocket-able. The lens does stick out a bit, too bad they couldn't have made it flush with the body.Stereo microphone, unfortunately the placement of the microphone may be problematic if you hold the camera with 2 hands, holding with one hand is no problem.Flash is tiny, and I've covered it up a few times.For next generation of this product, I would hope they improve the GPS feature, make it quicker, give more feedback about the last GPS position that was locked and how old the location data is. Also the screen is hard to see at an angle, so trying to take shots above you head is difficult.I don't have many gripes so far.

St John", "ReviewID": "R1D9HXXA9W6NPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was interested in both the TX7 and the HX5V because of the HDR and low-light features.  I couldn't make up my mind from the specs alone so I bought both, with the intent of giving one of them to my son as a graduation present.I have separately reviewed the TX7, and there I give my take on these two features, which are identical for the two cameras.  In this review I'll just focus on the differences between the two.  There are three major ones:  size, interface, and zoom range.Curiously, despite the vastly different lens design, I could see no difference in the optical performance.  You can check this out yourself by visiting [...] and taking a look at the full-size samples of the HX5V and the TX5 (the TX7 has not been yet reviewed as I write this, but the lens is the same as that on the TX5).  Both are at the top of the compact class , especially at higher ISOs.As to size, the HX5V appears bulky next to the slim TX7.  The real difference is in the thickness.  It's quite noticeable when the cameras are sitting side-by-side.  The HX5V is heavier, but in actual use this isn't very noticeable.  Both cameras fit easily into your pants pocket.  The TX7 will also fit into your shirt pocket.Interestingly, I found that the HX5V's greater thickness is an asset while shooting.  It feels more comfortable in the hands.  I hold the camera in my left hand with the thumb and index finger.  When shooting with the TX7 it's very easy for my left middle finger to drift over the lens, ruining the shot if I'm not paying attention to the screen (easy to do in bright sunlight).  Not so for the HX5V, since the protruding lens in the shooting mode prevents this.In my TX7 review I say how much I like the touchscreen in that camera.  The HX5V has the traditional button navigation.  I much prefer the touchscreen.  It's a lot quicker.  However, the navigation on the HX5V is definitely better than on my previous compact, a Canon SD700IS.  Also, as with the TX7, the text and icons are clean and very readable, even with my poor eyesight.The TX7 has a 920MP screen, while the HX5V's screen has only 230MP.  You'd think there would be a noticeable difference between the two, but even looking at them side-by-side I don't see much of any.Another difference is the shutter release.  In the HX5V it's a round button, which is much better than the tiny thin bar on the TX7.  However, the button is located next to the control wheel, which is also round.  In fact, the wheel is on the right, where you'd normally expect to find the shutter release.  I found myself pressing on this a few times, vainly trying to take a shot.It's the zoom where the HX5V really shines.  The 25mm-250mm range is a great range (though with Samsung's HZ35W and HZ30W you get a whopping 24mm-360mm).  What's more, the HX5V's resolution is sharp at all focal lengths.  My SD700IS is a little soft at its maximum.To really test the HX5V at its maximum 250mm focal length I compared it to my DSLR (a Canon 20D, circa 2004) with a Canon 300mm EF 4.0 L lens.  The L-series Canon lenses are the white-bodied lenses you see professional sports photographers using.  They are top-of-the-line.  Many years ago  I foolishly spent nearly $1000 to buy a used one on e-Bay.  It's very, very sharp.I took shots with both cameras mounted on a tripod, using the self-timer to minimize shake.  Compared to the Canon combo the HX5V looked like a rowboat sitting next to a battleship.  In taking the shots I adjusted the camera-to-target position to account for the different focal lengths (the effective focal length of the 300mm lens with the 20D's sensor is huge) so that the image in the viewfinder or on the screen was roughly the same.  The target was a box of fertilizer, with lots of fine print.  Both cameras were set to their lowest ISO settings.On the monitor they looked the same, even at large magnifications, but the proof is in the printing.  So I first made a moderately cropped 8x10 print of the image produced by each camera (the uncropped prints would have been about 11x14).  I could see no difference between the two.  I then did severely cropped 8x10s, where the uncropped prints would have been roughly 16x20.  Again, no difference.I kept at it, making prints at huge magnifications.  I was feeling like the guy in Antonioni's Blow Up.  I made 8x10s of a tiny portion of the image, where the uncropped print would be a giant 32x40--essentially a poster.  At this level the HX5V showed some haloing around the details, but the sharpness was the same.I was amazed by this.  I would have bet money that at some point the Canon combo would have been sharper, but the facts are the facts.Which leads me to give some advice.  If you're reading this review you've probably already settled on a compact camera, but if you're considering a DSLR I think you should stick with the compact.  I wouldn't have said this a few years ago.  I've had a couple of film compacts over my life, but rarely used them because the quality was not as good as the bigger camera.  That's not true anymore.  Yes, a DSLR has certain advantages over a compact, but to me they pale next to the one fundamental truism in photography: a camera in your pocket is worth a lot more than a camera sitting at home on the shelf.  We should all get into the habit of slipping a little camera like the HX5V or the TX7 into our pocket or purse each day, just like a wallet or car keys.So, which camera am I going to keep?  I'm embarrassed to say that I can't seem to part with either.

That said, I retired my Nikon old old coolpix and traded in for this Sony.  I read over 100 reviews, that's probably even underestimated...and went to many different stores.  I was skeptical due to the price and the many choices of modes. I figured with that many choices a few were bound to be less than average quality.  Well I kept going back to this camera in my mind no matter what brand/models I looked at so I finally bought it off amazon and I must say I am pleasantly surprised.At first, I was extremely angry to be honest.  I couldn't get the indoor pictures to get rid of this obnoxious red and orange hue to the objects/people.  I switched to all the different modes, fussed with the flash options in the scene mode, nothing worked.  Then, realizing my giant idiot mistake, I manually switched off the flash on the display and kept it in auto mode and no more orange and red hue.  So, take my advice, if you get a picture that is way too saturated indoors, turn off the flash by hitting the button on the back, even if you keep it in auto mode, the pictures have more accurate color.  The low light picture quality is definitely better than most out there though. Just have to be cautious when chosing to keep the flash or not.Responding to some of the views, I agree that sometimes the pictures turn out soft, but with so many modes on the dial to play with and choose from, there is going to be one that turns out best for whatever situation you have, you have to be patient enough to switch it and find the best, not get frustrated and quit because what you thought first didn't work. Learned that the hard way personally =PThe outdoor quality is fantastic!  Those are brilliantly clear and accurately colored.  I took a few snaps of my backyard trees and you could make out all the details of the trunk and all the branches.  I will say if you take a lot of outdoor shots this camera will be wonderful for you, the quality is fantastic.  Even if you take mostly indoor I think most will be pleasantly surprised like I was, unless you are too impatient to fuss with the settings if your picture turns out less than perfect.Overall I would recommend it, even if you think you don't need all the settings or modes on the dial like auto, scene, movie, burst, etc.  I went through all of those modes in one day and I was one of the people that said originally before buying \"I think this will be too complicated for me, or I'll never use half of this!\"  Chances are you will have an occassion to use all the bells and whistles sooner rather than later.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't Leave Home Without It!", "Author": "J.

The first brought a Nikon DSLR (D200), the second brought an older Canon P&S; camera, and third isn't into photography. Naturally, I brought my new DCS-HX5V. My two photographer friends were so impressed with my little Sony camera, midway into our trip they both purchased DCS-HX5V cameras. How's that for a recommendation?Another story.... Our county fair just ended, and I entered four photos. Three of the photos, blown up to 13x19 inch prints, were taken with the DCS-HX5V, and one was taken with my Nikon D300. I asked the three judges to guess which photo was taken with the DSLR camera... all three picked wrong. Bottom line, don't pay much attention to reviews saying the images aren't sharp and are only good for 4x6 inch prints. BTW, all four photos won ribbons.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "King of the PnS and closest thing to DSLR quality", "Author": "vyruzreaper", "ReviewID": "RQRXSRJUW263X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is so much fun to use.

Sony customer support was no help. They just told me to go out and buy another memory card and a card reader and check it out. So I did that. Sure enough, it was a problem with the camera, not the memory card! But searching for that error, I can upon a ton of people with the same problem. So that's my advice. Check that.

First few calls, their network was down and they asked me to wait.  Then after days passed, I called back a few more times and got the same story.  Last call, they claimed they never received the camera.  I sent it in with their fed ex air bill.  I had to call fed ex and confirm they had received it.  Of course, they had.

They even first refused to pay for shipment of the camera to their repair center for the second time in six months.  I even tried to get them to take the camera back for a refund. I tried to get to customer service, transferred three times, and they said they would repair in again.  It would take a month.  Wow. What a great company.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!

After 5 months of usage, I can confirm all pros/cons others have written about it:Pros: - Very usable 10x.  You always want a little more, but 10x is sufficient for tracking your boy at a community hockey rink. - The multi-exposure, low light feature works magic (even in dusk without a flash), but the scene, your subject and your hands needs to be very still otherwise, the image will appear soft (more so than normal) if not blurred. - GPS acquires fast and compass/picture direction is accurate.  Need to run the included Sony Album software with Google Map pluggin to display pictures on a map.  Interface to the pluggin is a little awkward to use... need to drag pictures from the Sony Album software into the Google Map pluggin window in order to see the pictures on a map.  Would be nice if the \"map view\" was more integrated.  GPS also appears to be always on even when camera is off as the lithium ion battery drains over the course of several weeks on non-use... Use to just grabbing the camera and go, but have been surprised on several occasion with low battery.  You can manual turn off the GPS, but then you will have to remember to turn it back on.  Would be nice if menu allows for GPS to be turned-off when camera turns-on.  None the less, it's more than just a gimmick.  Nice to put in context, on a Google Map, where your beautiful moments were captured. - Video is indeed HD and color accuracy as well as low-light operations is excellent.  Although it's stereo, sound isn't that great and you can hear some internal camera noise.  Anti-motion compensation also works good (can film while walking/hiking without inducing motion sickness to the viewers).  The dedicated movie button means you can switch from pictures to movies and back without having to fumble with the mode dial... very useful when you have one opportunity to capture the moment in both pictures and video. - Rapid shot is very fast (I have to set it to a slower setting to get 10 non-identical action pictures) - Guaranteed nice/decent pictures most of the time, but... (see Cons)Cons: - Color appears normal (no weird blues or greens), but perhaps not vivid enough. - Images are too soft (over-active noise reduction software?) - GPS drains battery and not convenient to switch on/off. - Flash washes out subjects that are too close... which really isn't excessively close.If you are a picture purist, go with the Canon or Panasonic. If you are willing to make a noticeable sacrifice in picture quality in order to improve your chance of capturing the perfect moment in a decent shot (i.e. in low light, acceptable lag, fast next shot recovery, nice video quality even in low light, decent speed/accuracy with auto focus), then this camera is it.  If you have a tripod and want to get some really awesome low light shots (that look like day), then no other camera in this price range can top this.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good camera vs ok camera, based on your specific needs", "Author": "Harry M. Shin", "ReviewID": "R32LTFNFOC356", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "1.  Just a few qualifying remarks:  I like sony products (F828, V3, R1), I've used many different analog and digital cameras over the years.2.  Most folks who are really into photography will agree with my contention that there is no close to perfect camera and there definitely is not one camera that is suited to all tasks.  Thus, it's a reasonable thing to have at least.. two cameras and certainly unreasonable to expect that one camera will do most things.  Thus, whether you'll like this camera (ie keep it and use it) will depend on your specific needs / goals for this camera.3.  My impressions after using this for 2-3 months:  a.  Image Quality:  I know that this is going to sound oxymoronic, but this is the worst part of the camera--> the images are just... amateurish looking.  I mean, the really depressing thing is that the JPEGS from the HX5V are overtly worse compared to the Sony V3 JPEGS (ie a relatively ancient camera with ancient technology).  What I mean by amateurish is that the colors are overly saturated, the white balance isn't as accurate as a modern camera should be, and the images are overtly contrasty... and of course, Sony gives the user no option to modify the tone curve.  All of these things can be somewhat compensated for via Photoshop etc... but it's just an additional step, which really shouldn't be necessary.  b.  Size:  It's pretty small, not as small as some of the other cameras out there, but small enough for most folks--> definitely small enough to put in your pocket.  Compared to something like the LX3, where the lens barrel still protrudes when turned off, this camera is nice and slim when turned off--> bottomline, this is the only reason to have this camera (at least for me)--> a decent quality camera, with various features, in a very compact size.  c.  HD movie:  This was another selling point for me; nice quality video in a very small form factor.  d.  Most of the other features are just gimmicks, but the one thing that is really cool (perhaps not of interest to others) is the panoramic sweep mode.  I'm into doing a lot of panoramics with my other cameras and I know how tedious it can be.  Thus, when you experience the magical ease of just moving this camera from one side to the next (shooting 10 fps) and then see the in camera stitched results;  that is some really amazing technology.  Furthermore, the flexibility that Sony allows in the panoramic mode is laudable:  ie you can designate whether you want to pan left--> right, right--> left, up--> down, down--> up.  Even more amazing is that since this camera has a compass or some type of gyroscope, it is able to determine at what angle you're shooting the panorama at and thus compensate for it --> giving you a corrected horizontal panorama (those of you who shoot panoramas know what I'm talking about).  The downside as noted above comes down to the image quality--> the JPEGs are just so-so.  Furthermore, you have no control over ISO, shutter speed etc... It's all pretty much automated in that sense.  What I'm really looking forward to (most likely way down the road) is when Sony implements this panoramic sweep technology into their SLR line or Mirrorless line, with the ability to shoot RAW and with different lens.  With the HX5, you can only shoot panos at the 24mm equivalent focal length.  Nonetheless, there are certain shooting situations in which I can get really unique and interesting panos with this camera which I wouldn't be able to get with my regular more sophisticated gear.4.  Thus, if you need a small / compact, nicely designed camera with a nice feature set (nice focal length range, cool panorama mode, HD video, along with ability to take... decent snapshots) to carry around during those times when lugging around a bigger camera is going to be a pain in the butt;  this is definitely a camera to consider.

Nevertheless, I would say the image quality is good for a point and shoot and the colors are definitely an improvement over the Sony WX1.  If you want more in-depth analysis on pixels and IQ, I suggest doing a search on dpreview or look at images on flickr or picasa to draw your own conclusions.  There are also a number of reviews online such as cameralabs and imaging-resource.With that being said, what makes this camera so great are its features.  And there are a lot of them!  I personally enjoy the panoramic shots and being able to capture expansive scenery in one swoop. The smile detection feature is also a lot of fun as I find my family and friends posing in front of the camera and trying to trigger the smile shutter.  The anti-motion blur is useful to reduce camera shake.  For instance, if you zoom in 10X optically or 20X digitally, it is difficult to keep your hands steady, but if you use anti-motion blur with its 6 superimposed images, the pictures come out clear.  Nice!Features:- iSweep Panoramic:  improved version over the Sony WX1. You do get a \"ghosting\" effect with fast moving objects.  However, for people that are walking, the subject appears only once.- Anti-Motion Blur:  takes 6 shots with one press of the shutter and superimposes the images to create one image with no blur.  I find this feature useful when you can't keep your hands still such as in a crowded stadium/concert/bar or when you're zoomed in on a distant subject.- Handheld Twilight:  same thing as Anti-Motion Blur but the colors are warmer.  Use this setting for low-light or night pictures for good results.- 1080i/720p HD Movie:  Video appears smooth with the new Active Mode stabilization and you can optically zoom 10X while recording.  It also has stereo sound but the left and right microphones are located on top of the camera, so you have to be careful when holding it to not cover the mic.- HDMI Output:  the camera comes with an HDMI adaptor to hook up to your HD TV.  It does not come with the cable, so I bought this one and it works Mediabridge Ultra Series - 6ft High Speed HDMI Cable - Version 1.3 Category 2 Certified - 1080p - Blu-Ray - PS3.- Slideshows:  seems very minor, but I particularly enjoy being able to upload your own music onto the camera.  So with the HDMI adaptor and cable, you can instantly play your own slideshows for friends and family.  If you do not have an HD TV, the camera also comes with a standard A/V cable bundle- GPS and compass:  From my experience, it locks on in about 10-15 seconds. It varies depending on climate and location. And I have been able to have the GPS lock on indoors as well.  However, I do not use it and I have it turned off. I can see it being useful for travel or hiking.- High Dynamic Range:  Takes two shots at two different exposures and superimposes them to capture detail that would be lost in shadows.  It works but I wish it took 3 shots from bracketing instead of just two shots.- 10 fps:  It does take 10 pictures in one second in full resolution.  However, it takes about 15 seconds to store those 10 shots and in that time you cannot take another picture.  You can change the burst mode to 5 fps and 2 fps which is a nice option.- Smile Shutter:  camera has face detection and smile detection as it will automatically take a picture whenever it detects a smile.  I find it pretty accurate and it's fun for the kids to test if the camera can read their smirk or joker-like smile.- Manual Mode:  allows you to pick a shutter speed between 30 seconds to 1/1600th of a second.  but only allows two aperture settings - at wide angle at f3.5 and f8 and at telephoto it is at f5.6 and f13.  the shutter speed is useful if you have a tripod and you want to capture more light.  but the camera is lacking in shutter and aperture priority.Overall, a great camera and a lot of FUN to use. It has a ton of features to accommodate almost any setting.  Whether or not this is the right camera for you..well you have to evaluate your priorities, do you want better image quality and portability then look at the Canon S90 or Panasonic LX3.  If you want high zoom and HD video in a small package, then also take a look at the Panasonic ZS7 and Canon SX210IS in addition to this camera.If you already bought the camera, I suggest the Case Logic TBC-302 Camera Case.  It fits it perfectly and the front zipper pocket allows you to store 2 extra batteries or 1 battery and extra memory card.  You can let it hang off of your belt loop or you can take the carabiner off and just stick it in your pocket (which I do).  It's small enough to fit in loose fitting jeans/slacks or cargo shorts.Caselogic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage (Black)I also bought the ZAGG Invisible Screen Protector for the Sony DSC-H20.

Let's find out.The HX5V utilizes a CMOs sensor + bionze processor that provides certain unique features over other cameras, most notable is the handheld twilight(HHT) and anti-blur mode, which takes six shots and combines them using noise-averaging to reduce noise and enhance details, saving you the hassle of doing it yourself later. [...] . HHT mode works equally well indoor and outdoor, so you should take advantage of this feature whenever you want to obtain the best image quality. One caveat is that HHT and anti-blur mode only works well in still scene settings, areas that have any motions (people walking, water ripple, leaves blown by wind, etc), will not benefit from HHT as the processor will not be able to combine the six shots to enhance those areas. Having said that, if you enjoy going to the museum and take flashfree pics, this feature will come in really handy.Another great feature is the camera's burst mode, you can take up to 10fps in full resolution, not many non-SLR camera can achieve this. It does take time to write the files to your memory card, but if you screw up the take, the camera gives you the option to cancel the process so you can retake your shots. It lacks a continuous shooting mode that may be important to some folks.The Sweep Panoramic mode is both awesome and lacking at the same time, it is awesome in that it makes the tedious task of panoramic images so effortless and fun, it's lacking in that the maximum vertical resolution is only 1080pixels if you pan horizontally, panning vertically increase the resolution to 1920 pixels, but coverage angle is reduced. So if you plan to blow up your panorama of the Golden Gate Bridge or Hong Kong Skyline and hang it on your living room, you may be disappointed.I also enjoy using the robust video recorder. It offers the choice of AVCHD in full 1080 glory as well as the more convenient MP4 format. For outdoor shooting, you can pretty much leave your camcorder home. I like the dedicated movie button so you can take video without switching the mode dial first. With the CMOs sensor, your video will not be plague by vertical streaks from CCD cams like the Panasonic ZS7 or Sony H55, there is also much less blown highlights. However CMOs do not perform as well indoor with artificial lighting. When shooting indoor with natural light during daytime, the video still holds up very well, however video quality takes a dive under incandescent/flourescent lighting, there is lots of chroma noise, and details are soft. The video is still usable if you shoot at 1080 and rescale it to DVD 480p resolution, however viewing it on full HD would not be a pleasant experience.Audio is not as bad as the as some other reviews have claim around the web, two things of note, the mic is very susceptible to wind noise, so a windscreen for outdoor shooting is a must, I made a dead cat windscreen from one of my old stuff animal, and when I need to to shoot outdoor, I just rubberband the windscreen over the mic. Another issue with the mic is the dramatic drop-off in input audio level after 5 feet, so make sure you do not talk too loudly when recording or your voice will completely overwhelm other sound in your recording. Want to take the camera to a loud concert? I advise you to do some test at home first, put on some ear plug, crank up your stereo system, play music with heavy bass, and then determine how much foam/fabric you need to place over the mic to minimize distortion. If the audio is acceptable and not distorted, then give it a go at the concert, make sure you stand far away from the speakers.A minor but convenient feature is switching between shooting and playback mode, if you are reviewing your shots and want to take another pic quickly, you can press your shutter, it will return you to shooting mode right away.The HX5V produces very pleasing color overall, Red is over-saturated, but it makes image pop. AWB is generally accurate, with a shift toward yellow hue that is easily correctable, skin tones with or without flash is render nicely, unlike the Panasonics that give horrible magenta cast on people's faces.There is slight barrel distortion when taking pictures at wide angle, the distortion becomes quite noticeable when using video, I personally am not too bother by it, but when shooting pictures with people, you may want to avoid framing the person's head near the corners, or they will look stretched.The HDR mode is suppose to improve the dynamic range of high contrast scenes, however, I have not had much success using this.The lithium ion battery that came with the camera drains very quickly, especially if you plan to take lots of video. I bought an OEM backup battery for $8 and it lasts longer than Sony's.The HX5V would be the perfect camera if it delivers better image quality. Like other Sony line of compact cameras, the internal processor applies fairly aggressive noise reduction on every picture across the entire iso speed setting. The noise reduction smudges fine detail and turns water and leaves into oil painting when view in full resolution. It does work well for portraits as it will smooth out your blemish and wrinkles. LOL. If you love taking nature photography, this camera is not suitable for you. I mark down a full-star from the review because there is no option to disable it. Bad Sony.For the P&S; crowd who mostly view their pictures on screen/TV or make prints up to 8x10 with minimal post processing, the pictures hold up well. If you happen to need to do some cropping or enlargement beyond 8x10, you may not be too pleased with the quality.As someone who values image quality quite highly, it was difficult to give a fair assessment for this camera. There is a lot to like about the HX5V - picture quality are quite good right out of the camera, there isn't much post-processing needed to get good prints, however, for the few occasions that you need to blow up your favorite photo to poster size,  you have to work much harder to produce a decent quality image due to the in-camera noise reduction. In the end, I decided to keep the camera because I enjoy low light photography and there is no other camera in its class that can match its capability. Indoor video is a letdown, but certainly not a deal-breaker.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Ultimate Hiking Camera", "Author": "Hugh Watkins", "ReviewID": "R2KFSURQYZFAK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting a long time for someone to develop this camera and Sony finally did it.Pros: GPS, Compass, Picture Quality, AVCHD (1080i), Weight, Shutter SpeedCons:No GPS Coordinates on screen, just simple indication of GPS LockCompass Bearing hard to decipher, just simple compass needleThis camera is a winner, no it won't replace your GPS or your DSLR (ok honestly it may replace my DSLR, the image quality is fantastic!), but for what I wanted which is a way to record life from the hiking trail this is the camera to buy.I run secretfalls dot com and I love to be out in the woods hiking, but lugging the DSLR, Camcorder and the GPS, then trying to Geocode after the trip was just time consuming and bulky.

You can turn on the camera and shoot a picture in 2-3 seconds which is much better than my previous Nikon.I ran through a couple of the shots I made looking at actual EXIF data for the GPS latitude and longitude, it looks to be accurate to around 15-20 feet when I have 3 satellite lock.  My Garmin GPS 60CSx is my gold standard and it can typically get me to within 5 feet.  The Sony apparently only locks onto 3 satellites and updates at 15 second intervals (I'm sure to save battery).

I'm a Mom of a young child so I'd like to take pictures with the least effort possible.  I purchased and returned: Canon SX210, Panasonic FH20, Panasonic zs6, Panasonic zs7, Kodak z950, Samsung HZ30W, and Sony H55.  I tried (in-store) the Casio FH100 and Panasonic ZR3.  Finally, my winner was the Sony HX5V.  With compact cameras there seems there's no PERFECT camera, so you must choose the one that best suits your needs.  I love my e-pl1, but it won't fit in my purse, and I wasn't very impressed with its movies, and decided that instead of buying a long zoom lens for oly, I would buy a compact camera with a long zoom for ballet recitals, etc., and it had to have accurate color in photos taken inside.  Here's what I found:Canon SX210 - Photos taken in good lighting or with flash were super sharp with accurate color.  Anything at higher ISOs, and I must note the camera insisted on going straight from its lowest ISO to ISO800 on auto, was very blurry and greenish.  Changing the white balance didn't seem to do much good.I'm a big Canon fan and i was really disappointed that I couldn't make it work.Panasonic zs6/zs7 - Basically the same cameras, except the zs7 has GPS and more adjustments for movies.  I found their pictures to have a greenish cast, and pictures taken with flash with the subject more than about 5 feet away made subjects look \"day-glo\" (again, I, not an expert, couldn't find a happy white balance).  Videos on the zs6 indoors turned subjects in shadow completely black, videos from the zs7 were fabulous.Pansonic FH20 - not surprisingly, just not on-par with the other cameras I tried.Panasonic zr3 - seemed, in-store, to very comparable to the zs6/zs7 with a lower zoom.  Might be a good choice if you like the first 2 but want something more pocketable.Casio FH100 - I think the camera in-store had been messed with quite a bit, but I made sure I had it set to highest IQ and put in auto to avert any possible unfortunate settings, and the camera was slow, with bad colors, blurry pictures, etc., etc.  I may have been unlucky, but yuck!Kodak z950 - great sharpness, colors, movies.  Except for one big problem, for which i took the first camera back thinking it defective and had the same problem with the 2nd unit.  After taking 3 pictures, the camera would say \"processing\", and you could possibly pry a picture or 2 out of it every 7-8 seconds, until the camera quit processing, but if you forced it, vertical lines would cover the entire lcd screen and the camera would turn off.  I've had feedback saying that using program mode other than auto will circumvent this problem, but I had the same trouble no matter what.  If you don't need speed, then I HIGHLY recommend this camera.Samsung HZ30W - VERY close runner-up to HX5V, and recommended to family members.  Colors are great, pictures sharp.  Barely edged out by the HX5v having a little better low-light color accuracy, flash power choice, and exposure.  Otherwise, it took great pictures, sharper than the HX5, and much more customizable.  And considerably cheaper.Sony H55 - very flat, contrastless, inaccurate colors.So, finally, I chose the HX5V because of its ease of use (read: slacker operator) at producing pictures in low light with accurate colors, with flash or without.  It's true that the noise reduction can smudge fine detail, still, I had some images that were super sharp, like one I took of our pet mouse, Mr. Jingles.  Every little hair and whisker when he looked up at me showed up on his cute face.I took pictures in low light, with or without flash, with the Samsung HZ30w, Sony HX5v, and Panasonic ZS7 and shared with a few family and friends.  Without them knowing which camera I preferred, they all picked the HX5 as the winner, with the samsung a close second.I have no info on the GPS function as I completely don't need it.

The difference in picture quality and control between a point and shoot and an SLR camera was enormous. That gap has been closing especially in the last two years. With this new Sony HX5V that gap does not exist anymore.I am an advanced amateur photographer. Photography is my passion and has been for many years. My \"main\" camera is a Nikon D5000 with a Nikkor 18-200 VR II lens. This is a new, high-end model with an amazing lens, worth probably $1500. After using the Sony HX5V for a week, I am seriously considering selling my Nikon simply because it is hard to justify the price difference.Let's start with picture quality. The two main elements in a digital camera are the lens and the sensor. Up until now, point and shoot cameras have used CCD sensors, which are inferior to CMOS sensors, used in most DSLRs. The difference is especially noticeable in low-light conditions. CMOS sensors produce much less noise and higher picture quality at high sensitivity (ISO setting). The Sony HX5V is one of the first compact cameras to use a CMOS sensor. 10 megapixels is more than what 99.99% of people will ever need.The lens is very versatile: unlike most zooms, this one starts at 25mm wide angle, which means you can take great pictures indoors when you are close to your subject. It has a 10X optical zoom, enough for most purposes. It is one of Sony's \"G\" lenses, which means it is made with the same quality standards as their lenses for DSLRs costing hundreds of dollars. The zoom is controlled with a button (like with most compact cameras) as opposed to manually (as with most DSLRs) which is a drawback of this format. The Sony would sometimes guess I wanted to go full zoom and go all the way - similar to electric car windows that roll all the way down after pressing the button for a second.After looking at the specs and the online photos I expected the camera to be bigger, but it is actually smaller than my smart phone and smaller than the Lumix TZ4 camera it replaces. It fits in my jeans pocket comfortably and I can carry it in my portfolio at all times, which is a huge advantage over any DSLR. The camera is light, the battery lasts a long time and the screen is very bright.The Flash is surprisingly good. It took some pictures of people indoors, a couple pictures in bright light where I used the flash to fill-in the shadows and then I took a picture of our kitchen (like the ones you see in a realtor ad) and was surprised by the even illumination and sharpness of the picture. Surely beats my Nikon's built-in flash.On Saturday I took a picture of my daughter's Birthday cake with ISO 3200 setting. The Sony has a cool feature where it takes a couple low-light pictures and combines them to produce a better image. The results are absolutely amazing. I rival any DSLR short of $5,000 to top the quality.At the Austin Rodeo this weekend, I tried the burst shooting mode at the pig races (really). The ability to take 10 shots per second means you won't lose the action. Yesterday at a park downtown I used the panorama feature to pan across the landscape and the Sony took care of building and stitching multiple images into one, it looked perfect!Some people will enjoy the ability to shoot movies at full HD resolution (1920 x 1080 @ 60 frames per second. I is really nice to be able to zoom while shooting video. Movie mode is only a button away, so it is very convenient.The camera includes a GPS sensor and a compass, which means every photo (outdoors, where the camera can get a satellite signal) will be tagged with the precise location and orientation where it was shot.Face detection and smile detection will ensure you get all your people in focus and that you will capture the smile you are looking for. There is a full manual mode and an easy mode - making both me (the advanced photographer) and my wife (novice photographer) happy with the same camera.Last, but not least, the camera includes a HDR function that takes three pictures with different light settings and combines them into one, providing the best image possible for high-contrast scenarios. I plan to test this feature in the next few days.Essentially, the Sony HX5V gives you the same quality sensor (CMOS) and lens (G-class) as you would get with a DSLR with a powerful 10X zoom and tons of cool features. For $350 (list) it is an absolute steal. If you can afford it, it is a no brainer. If you are thinking about buying a DSLR, this Sony could give you a better camera at a fraction of the cost.Sample photos available at:  [...]", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Most fun camera ever", "Author": "Gavin Scott", "ReviewID": "R3784OITTEYARC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There's a reason this camera is selling out everywhere at the moment.I've had more fun taking pictures the last week than I have ever had with any other camera.You know how your old point-and-shoot camera has a bunch of different modes and probably some \"scene modes\" that you can hunt around for in menus and which never really seem to do much? The HX5V has all this stuff on steroids and it's both powerful and useful and easy to get to.The large mode dial on the top of the camera lets you jump back and forth between the different modes (panorama, fully auto, Hand Held Twilight, etc.) and I believe the settings are saved in each mode so you rarely have to change anything. No hunting through menus to get to another mode, just spin the dial and off you go.The HX5V is small and easy to hold for an extended period of time. I spent a couple hours wandering around the zoo yesterday pretty much holding it in my hand the whole time without getting tired. Try that with a DSLR. It doesn't matter how good and expensive your camera is if it's so big that you don't bother to take it with you.It's extremely fast and responsive. Pre-focused shots are virtually instantaneous and even with focus you'll almost always get the shot as it's very quick. This is a huge improvement over older cameras I've used.My favorite HX5V features so far:1) Sweep Panorama mode. Spin the dial to the panorama mode, hold the shutter and move the camera around to create a 270 degree panorama shot. The camera takes a whole bunch of pictures and then stitches them all together in a couple seconds, and the results are amazing. This gives you a very interesting and different way to photograph a location, and the camera is worth the price for this alone.2) 10-shot burst mode. Touch the still/bracket button on the top of the camera and you enable burst mode by default. This will take 10 pictures over a one second period, and is perfect for capturing animals, kids, or any other moving/uncooperative subject. It does take about 20 seconds or so to process and save all ten shots to the memory card before it's ready to shoot again.3) HDR backlight mode. This is one of numerous modes the camera has that involve it taking multiple exposures and then merging them together. In HDR mode it takes two shots in quick succession to expose both highlights and shadows, and then merges the two together to create a result that has the appearance of having much more dynamic range than you could get from a single exposure. It really works well with backlit subjects.4) Hand Held Twilight (HHT) mode. This snaps a series of images and then syncs/merges them together to produce a sharp lower-noise image than you could get from a single long-exposure shot. Works great in low light situations.5) Video. the HX5V can capture great looking 1080i High-Definition video. You don't even have to switch into \"movie mode\" as there's a dedicated record button that will start recording video while in any mode. So if your subject starts doing something interesting, just hit the button and it's quickly recording full definition video. The results are really quite impressive.6) GPS. The camera contains both a digital compass and a GPS receiver, and will \"geotag\" pictures with their location and the direction you were facing. It's great to be browsing your photo collection and be able to click a link in the metadata (I'm using Adobe Lightroom) and have a Google maps satellite image come up showing you exactly where the picture was taken. So far it is amazingly accurate, at least when shooting outdoors where it can get a good view of the sky. If the camera has boon off for a long while then it takes about 30s to get a lock on the position, but if you've had it on recently then it only takes a few seconds to re-establish the position when you turn the camera back on.There's a bunch more useful and fun stuff it can do, but those are the most interesting features for me so far. This camera just does so much that it adds new dimensions of fun to taking pictures, and its advanced features are made easier to use than you might expect. There's even an \"easy mode\" that increases the size of the text on the display and simplifies the information shown for your less-technology-savvy user.Just a great fun camera overall.G.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "THE KING OF POINT & SHOOT RIGHT NOW.", "Author": "Louise Deng", "ReviewID": "R3AZSPPAZKK1MJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was going to consider investing some big $$$ into a DSLR camera, but what's the point?? First off, DSLR is not my style~~it's chunky and hard to carry. It's an attention grabber, making it easier for other people to easily sum up my camera price & try and take it away from me. 2nd, I don't have a problem with DSLR because Everyone knows that the image quality is fantastic. It's just a personal preference for me. For me, I like to be able to control most of it digitally. Right now, the DSLR is a 'hype' and I Didn't want something that most people here already had.So I ordered mine off of another site and it was $20 less...but anyways, the weight of the camera makes me Not want to put it down. At first, I thought it'd be a light camera because of it's cousin: H55. I didn't like how it felt kinda cheap on that one...but for the HX5V, you feel like you're holding a baby, future DSLR. The image quality for 10.2 mp is awesome. I've tested the 14.1 H55 mp and it's just incomparable to this one because of the awesome Exmor sensor in this one. The GPS and compass is a cute feature; not much use to it but very futuristic. Although sony has actually offered this feature to many camcorders previously. The video recording on this baby is the exact quality of a Sony camcorder. In fact, it's even higher than most of them! So that's very impressive. Of course, it's SanDisk & Memory Pro Duo friendly. It also has this feature \"TransJet\" It basically means that if you gently 'bump' with another Sony transjet friendly camera, then you are able to switch infos with one another. Right now, only the TX7 and the HX5V are able to do this. But you'll need a TransJet Sony card for that...probably very $$ right now. So wait a bit (; Also, there isn't a 'lock' on the battery door.Something that totally turned me off was that the battery door was SUPER light feeling and kinda 'cheap and thin' feeling. I didn't like it at first...but I understand why now. It's because that's where the transjet takes place! So they needed to make it thinner in order to be able to make transjet happen.The Most attractive thing about this cam is the G Lens! It's s-e-x-y. Every time I watch it, I find it's so pretty! It's like a purple, black color. Stunning.I'm in love with this camera, and I'm sure that if you buy it or are planning on buying it, you'll love it too!PS: the low light on this baby is WONDERFUL!!

In my experience, the HX5V can take some absolutely wonderful pictures, but also some not so great ones, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why.  Yes, all the comments about the funky auto white balance on the HX5V are true -- the camera does produce pictures with a strong yellow cast, especially indoors or using the flash -- but only sometimes.  Other times, the auto white balance in Intelligent Auto is fine.  And yes, the Panasonic cameras in general, and the ZR1 in particular, produce sharper images than the HX5V on a more consistent basis, especially outdoors -- but not always.  BUT, I found that the HX5V does have significantly better low light/indoors capability than the Panasonics, even when not using HHT mode, and especially when not using the flash.  I also found that the HX5V did a better job on macros than the ZR1 (although again, not always).  Bottom line: I ended up keeping both the HX5V and the ZR1 (the HX5V for its indoors/low light capability, and the ZR1 for outdoors/all around shooting).", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera quit during vacation, Sony won't honor warranty.", "Author": "M.

First of all, the M (manual) mode is something that most pocket-sized point and shoot cameras do not have.  Only the Sony H55, the Panasonic ZS7, and perhaps a small handful of canon and nikon pocket digital cameras have a manual mode that allow you to manually adjust the shutter speed and aperture.  I find that to be essential.  I love taking night shots, and you cannot take a high quality night shot without slowing the shutter speed down and placing the camera on a support, like a gorillapod.  I can carry this camera with my gorillapod in my pocket and take long exposure, low ISO night photos that rival my Nikon D3100 or my Panasonic GH1.  Those cameras take great night shots as well, but I would have to carry a backpack and tripod to take the photos.  This camera is capable of taking very high quality daytime photos as well.  In addition to some of my test shots, I have seen great photos taken on this site and flickr from other HX5V users.  The Sony G lens is supposedly as good or better than the Carl Zeiss lens on other Sony cameras.  In addition to being a 10 times optical zoom, it allows you to also shoot at a very wide angle, which is great.  I also like the GPS feature.  I just uploaded a photo I took at Disney World to flickr with this camera, and flickr showed the spot on a google map.  It was within literally 10 yards of where I took the photo.  The panorama mode is also a pretty neat feature that I will have some fun with.Additionally, this camera offers two different modes to take hand-held night shots that use some neat in-camera processing tricks to make them less grainy.  When a photo is taken in the \"handheld twilight\" setting, the camera actually quickly takes 6 photos at one time and combines them together so that the background is free of noise.  There is another setting called \"anti-motion blur\" that does something similar.  I still don't think the shots come out anywhere as good as putting the camera on a gorillapod and increasing the exposure time in M mode, but they come out much better than the twilight setting on any other point and shoot, with less grain and with no blur.  It is better than using a flash or jacking up the ISO setting.  Another interesting mode that I haven't used yet is the \"backlight correction HDR\" mode, which snaps two photos with different exposures and uses the difference to create an HDR-like image.  I have always been interested in trying out HDR photography, so that should be an interesting mode to try.The video on this camera is amazing for the price.  First and foremost, this camera's optical image stabilization in video mode is amazing.  It blows away the lens-based stabilization on my Panasonic GH1 or Nikon D3100 in video mode.  These are much more expensive cameras.  As a matter of fact, for my GH1 I purchased this huge geeky Merlin-style stabilizer in order to to take stable video while walking.  The HX5V takes just as stable video without an external stabilizer.  None of the flip HD cameras provide optical image stabilization; only camcorders normally do this.  I cannot over-emphasize how impressed I am with the optical stabilization.  Secondly, this camera offers both MP4 and AVCHD recording formats.  AVCHD is a great format for playing on large televisions.  It is the standard for high definition recording, as its compression is more efficient than motion JPEG and you can record for longer periods.  I am not aware of any point and shoot camera or DSLR that shoots AVCHD video, other than a few Panasonic cameras.  I have tested the video mode on this camera in 1440 by 1080 in AVCHD and it looks great.  I have seen quite a few test videos on youtube by other users of this camera, and the video rivals my GH1, especially during the day.  But don't expect miracles--night video with a point and shoot camera with a slow lens and small sensor like this one is not going to be perfect.  It will be grainy or dark.  For night video, I don't think there is much that can compare with the Panasonic GH1 with the F1.7 pancake lens.  I can shoot extremely low light video with that camera at about ISO 800 and it is not grainy at all.  The video I take with the GH1 rivals a professional movie camera.Overall, if you want to have the power of a DSLR and good HD camcorder in one device that fits in your pocket, this is a great choice.  If you don't need the 1080 video, the AVCHD video format, the burst mode, the GPS, or the handheld low-light trick modes, perhaps you should save $100 and go with the Sony H55.  I had the H55 for a while before this one, and I liked it a lot.  But I returned it and got this one because of the additional features.  I figured I would regret down the road not spending the extra $100 to get everything I really wanted.UPDATE:  After using this camera for a few months now, I see what others are saying about the color issues.  I agree that the auto white balance is not accurate.  And most of my daylight photos come out dull.  I have to post process every photo I take with this camera and increase color saturation in photoshop or picasa.  I would probably downgrade by review to 4 stars now that I realize this.  I wish this camera had some internal settings to increase or decrease sharpness, contrast, and color saturation.

It takes pretty good pictures for a point-and-shoot, and unlike some earlier Sony models, which I didn't consider because they took only proprietary memorystick cards, this one takes standard SD cards.  A great step forward.A couple of things that weren't ideal.  First, the way it achieves its low-light capability, or at least its lowest-light capability, is by taking a series of 6 shots and compositing them together.  My subjects - my kids - tend to move around, and it's not very good at that.  It's not any worse than other cameras, and probably a little better, but if you're expecting the \"Exmor S\" sensor to give you much _faster_ photography you may be disappointed.Second, though the memory card is now standard SD, the cable connector is still proprietary.  This may be a small thing or it may be a big deal, depending on your workflow.  For me it's a real pain.  I have several cameras, and I leave a mini-USB cord hanging off of my computer which I can connect to my Canon or Nikon and be downloading in a jiffy; or use to charge the blackberry; or etc.  Also when I lose the cable that comes with the camera I have a dozen more in a box.

You get an optical stabilizer and video options comparable to Sony's high end consumer videocams in a camera that fits in your pocket.  The stereo mic is a bit mis-placed, but one gets used to it.  The daylight still photos are just OK, the low-light ones are better than any you'll get without a DSLR.  Just don't expect great color balance if the illumination is from sodium vapor street lamps.  You must also select program mode to select a white balance to reduce the red effect of incandescent bulbs.The AVCHD video requires a multi-core PC with a dedicated graphics card to play or edit properly.  Windows 7 plays OK; Vista requires istallation of an AVCHD friendly player or codecs fo the WMP.  Otherwise, stick to the MP4 video options.  However, a person familiar with HD video will be mighty impressed with the quality of the video from such a small, relatively inexpensive, camera.  As observed by another reviewer, the sound capture suffers the limitations of just about any tiny on-board mics (or hearing aids), but is better than most in its class.  People who intend to shoot heavily amplified music events will witness an overload, while those trying to capture distant voices or natural settings will consider the capture too weak or marred by wind noise.  A portable PCM sound device, or even a sterero conference recorder, might be relevant for people trying attain real \"CD quality\" results.SENSOR DUST is my one serious complaint.  After 7 months, 5k pictures, 30 hrs of video, and maybe several thousand miles in a pocket, dust has winnowed its way into the camera and drawn electrostatically to the sensor.  This is dust right over the CMOS, not on the lens.  Dust is somewhat inevitable, since the lens turret must draw in some air each time the camera turns on and the lens sticks out.  Ambient dust or pocket lint will sift to the lens piston seams and be ready to suck into the camera.  Mine never fell or sat in any dirt or sand.  But now I see ugly discoloratons in pictures taken at full optical zoom.  There is no simple way to clean the sensor.  Disassembly is not as simple as taking out some screws.  The top panel or strip, which braces the front and back panels, does not come off without popping off the control and zoom dials, which might wreck them.  The sensor is under the LCD and takes some TLC and skill to surgically attend.  The service manuals contain no unit on how to clean sensor dust, so I'd not trust Sony to offer a repair without charging essentially replacement cost.  In 2004, Sony simply returned a dust-ridden P93 model, still unde warranty, with no fix a all.If any commentors learned how to clean their HX5V sensors and reassemble the camera, it would be wonderful to know precisely how they did it.  Sooner or later, anyone who uses an HX5V a lot will find dust specs in the zoom photos, unless perhaps they keep it carefully sealed in a hypo-allergenic bag most of the time.

Maybe the fact that this camera is made in Japan, and not China, accounts for some of that.So far, I've not been disappointed with any aspect of the camera. Most of its features have been well documented by others so I won't repeat them here. And like with any electronic device, there's always going to be room for improvement. Some have commented on slow satellite acquisition times. This is true for the first time you turn it on after it's been unused for a while. However, I've found that once it's locked on to satellites, you can turn it on and off frequently thereafter and acquisition is fairly quick each time. The key is to turn it on well in advance of when you plan on taking your first shot.Minor criticisms are that I would like to see a sturdier battery/memory card door and stronger detents for the mode wheel (it's easy to turn it when you don't intend to), but none of these are major drawbacks in my opinion.

I wanted something that I could easily take along, biking,hiking, etc.  I also wanted a camera that takes great shots.  I compromised a little on the quality of the shots (from reviews - so far I think the pictures are great), what made me jump for this camera when it came out is the HD video 1080i at 60 frames per second.  The video is high quality on a HD TV.  You can zoom while taking the video just like a camcorder, but in a miniature package.  Software on your computer lets one take one frame of the video and make a 2 mega-pixel jpg picture.  You can take action video and pick just the best frame for a still picture.  At $350 plus $50 for a fast SDHC card the camera is less money than a Micro four thirds or SLR and a lot easier to carry.  I can carry the camera everywhere and never miss that special shot.  Sony and Panasonic have similar cameras.  The Panasonic has a lot of user functions but the reviews were not kind on these functions.  If you need to take a shot quickly, I don't have time to make manual adjustments.  With the Sony just put it on EASY and take your shot.  For video it has a seperate button that unfortunately does not work while in the EASY setting - a little aggravating.  I now turn the dial to movie and press the shutter to start recording.  You need to buy a HDMI cable.  Amazon sells one for approx. $3.00 and it works great. The AVCHD video format is hard to share.  The format works in BluRay players. I am still using Windows XP and it does not recognize the video files except in the Sony software.  I have read that Windows 7 recognizes the video format. The camera has built in GPS.  When I view a picture in Picasa then Google displays a map with the location where the picture was taken.  On a recent mountain biking trip, where I took pictures, the Google maps actually show the trails where the pictures where taken. Pretty nifty - probably good a year from now when I have forgotten where the picture was taken.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lots of features, high quality pictures", "Author": "Justin Siefert \"It's all good...\"", "ReviewID": "R3V9NSBYN10KP9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, this camera is quite a step up from my previous Cannon PowerShot which took grainy pictures unless you were in full sunlight. The quality difference with this camera is amazing. Details and colors pop.The list of features on this camera is too long to detail. The backlight correction and twilight/low light modes have come in handy a couple of times, turning indoor settings into great family memories. The 10 frame burst mode is fun to play with. I've have my son throwing a ball in slow motion and another set of my dogs jumping in the air. Not only is the action great to watch unfold in 10 frames, the quality is amazing.The HD video quality (in good light) is phenomenal. Even in poor light the quality is quite acceptable. Amazingly, the mics are better than my dedicated video camera (crap JVC Everio).Flash is ubber-bright in dark settings. It will light up a large room no problem. Just make sure you are not too close to your subject or they will wash out. I have also found putting my finger over half of the flash during normal indoor photos works great adding just the right amount of light to the room. The trick with this camera is you cannot think of it as a simple point-and-shoot. It has EASY mode and Auto Intelligent (something like that) for basic shots anyone can take but to really take advantage of this camera you will have to spend some time reading how to use it and then testing the settings in various scenes to learn what works best. Some of the photos I have taken have literally amazed me.The zoom is great too. I took a picture of my daughter at the playground from 40 feet away. The picture looked like I was standing right next to her and you could read the letters off a small sign behind her.Long story longer....it is a great camera. I am glad I spent the money.

I am not going to compare it to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 (because I own it but broken last fall--and I like the Sony better anyway), other than I'll say that the Lumix can't handle low light/indoor shots well without upping the ISO with flash off (and that looks bad).The unique features on this Sony P&S; is, at the time, the only (or one of the few) CMOS sensor, unlike CCD, which doesn't perform as well in low-light, and vertical bars, green/purple streaks when the sun is in the range. You don't have this problem with CMOS, and its speed and sensitivity in low-light are its main advantages over CCD. However, it doesn't make much difference in ambient light.The nice thing about the Sony is that it features GPS (I don't use that feature, and it drains battery life), Blink/Smile detection (see Cons), full-HD video, high-res/high-zoom capabilities (you can zoom during movies, but you can't take a photo while taking movies--the shutter button you use to take a photo will just end the movie as if you activated the Movie record button). You have very fast performance, can take ten full-res (10 MP) burst, but will take some seconds to write to the card. Sweep Panorama works great, but doesn't do well with contrast (e.g. at a baseball game--I've done it twice). However, resolution is rather low, but not bad for upload to Web, email, and maybe print as a banner for an ad.What I like (Pros)...- Performs well in any lighting conditions, and colors accurate (with/without flash)- In order to get decent results in low-light, use Anti-Motion Blur or Handheld Twilight (these work well)- AVCHD (full-HD) movies look great, but somewhat noisy in low light, quite detailed- Average photo quality for its price (some aggressive noise reduction)- Auto iA average performance (I don't use it that much though--manual works better)- Average battery life given its very small size (the charger takes five hours, so I'd say a mixed bag for this listing)- Image stabilization works very well, especially for sports shots in low-lightWhat I don't like (Cons)..- Blink/Smile Detection doesn't work based on my experience (tried taking self-portrait by smiling, regardless of 'smile sensitivity' setting, didn't 'auto-take'), or if it does work (e.g. haven't bothered trying with group), most likley not very well- Panorama feature doesn't work well in low or dim light because of contrast can't be handled properly- You can't take photos during movie mode (you can with a Canon PowerShot S2 IS and later, though, but that's no compact)- Could use less aggression for noise reduction- Panasonic DMC-FZ35 performs better with much less noise in low-light for movies (about as detailed though)- Battery life could be better, and the included charger charges too slowlyThat's enough for my experience at this time. Great camera, a little above average for your $350 P&S.; This model made in China, but performs as if it were made in Japan!Thanks for reading my review. Good luck!

I don't do reviews of products very often, but I thought I had to do this one.  My story is probably like many others - I've owned many cameras over the years, but was looking for something mindless and full featured...with good picture quality for both wide angle and zoom.  This camera, for under $200 (under $250 with a case and 32G chip) seemed like an easy purchase.  I was headed out to the mountains for a vacation and I ordered the camera a week before.  It arrived, I charged it and never bothered with the manual.  My intent was to use the iAuto mode for everything although I thought panorama mode was intriguing and given the amount of memory I added, I though video might be useful.  I don't like carrying heavy gear for hiking or for just snapshots, so I thought the size and form factor of the camera seemed like a reasonable size.The result?In iAuto mode and zooming as appropriate I found the picture quality far exceeded my expectations.  I took photos of everything including: people indoors in poorly lit cabins, mountain panoramas, wildflowers at close range, a video of two marmots wrestling just off the trail, people snapshots, night photos of a lake and mountains and more.The video was one button and I zoomed in and out (forgot it was recording sound as well) and the quality was excellent for the amount of memory used.  I have no idea if I could vary the resolution and I didn't care.  I pushed the button.  It worked.  Enough said.The panorama mode is mind-boggling.  I have no idea how it constructs such a perfect, one sweep shot, but it's remarkable technology.  In one shot someone was walking across the shot in a mountain/lake scene and it made them into a single image, unblurred and without editing.  I pushed the shutter and panned the shot and it worked.The iAuto mode was quite good, and dealt very well (but not perfectly) with a large number of different environments.  Remember, I was using it to shoot heavily backlit mountain/glacier shots and also dark room snapshots of people without touching the mode setting.  It did the people snapshots extremely well (even an indoor close range panorama) but did slightly less well on the heavily backlit stuff, though someone could use a different mode for that - I was too lazy.  It took me a few shots to figure out how to back up and use zoom on wildflower closeups, but it worked after I tried a few different things.  The display is good enough that you know immediately whether a shot worked.If you are considering it, I wholeheartedly recommend it.

Oh well, that's fate!As I said in my other review I wanted a long zoom pocket sized camera and bought an Olympus VR-320 a few days earlier but that one I think is seriously lacking some necessary features and the picture quality is just so-so. So I went on Amazon again and bought this Sony hx5v. Anyway, for the price this is still a good camera for what you are getting: 10.2MP (which I think is enough for a pocket sized camera), 10x zoom which is also good enough for this size, real HD video (and you can still zoom during video recording), sweeping panorama, more adjustment options than the Olympus VR-320, decent picture quality. After taking some pictures and comparing them to the ones taken by the Olympus and my other pocket sized camera Panasonic FX500, I can give some opinions on the following:Picture quality: In general the picture looks good. Compared to Olympus and Panasonic, the day light pictures are a little soft, color cast is a little warmer. Pictures taken by Olympus tend to get Sun lighted area washed out, Sony is better; Low light picture Sony is better than the other two, noise level is lower on Sony, and color is also more real; flash on Sony is the best among the three; I like smiley face detection; for the video, Sony is the only one which you can zoom during video recording, and it has real HD and it takes in more light with video so indoor video quality is a lot better on Sony.For the cons: Sony ISO starts with 125 which I feel is too high; photo size options do not have 3:2 (I think it's needed); heavy noise reduction made the photo a little soft; GPS is kind of slow; deleting a picture takes quite a long time (almost 3 seconds); it can not print date on the picture (Olympus has this feature).Well, I may update this review later on when I get to know this camera more.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony DSC-HX5V state-of-the-art winner from Amazon", "Author": "gwb400 \"gwb400\"", "ReviewID": "R2L3JHYNW6GA0X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a small (but not tiny) zoom camera with a wide angle of 25-27 mm, and a long telephoto zoom (250mm or more), equipped with good image stabilization (no shaking), excellent color accuracy, and an automatic point-and-shoot setting that automatically adjusts itself depending on lighting conditions, movement, etc. without my bothering with the settings.  I found reviews for 3 cameras that appeared to meet my criteria: a Fujifilm FinePix F70EXR, a Panasonic ZS7, and a Sony DSC-HX5V.  The latter, the Sony, has really worked out well for me. I purchased it from Amazon in mid-January 2011, and it worked perfectly for me in an initial \"test trial\" of 500 indoor and outdoor pictures.  (One of the two other cameras listed above that I had bought a couple of months ago had problems with color accuracy and image stabilization; I returned it to Amazon without any problems.)  The Sony operated smoothly and exhibited no shaking; and the colors were 99% accurate.  Color reproduction only faltered once, on a brightly-colored red-and-blue back-lit stained glass window in a cathedral in Washington D.C. This DSC-HX5V has a very-wide angle and long-telephoto-zoom and it took amazing pictures for us.  We've owned 3 other digital cameras (2001, 2007, 2010) and this new Sony is certainly the best of all.  We used the \"iA\", Intelligent Automatic setting most of the time - its easy and the colors are accurate.  We took bright outdoor pictures with the long telephoto zoom, and at other times we photographed dark spaces such as in the eaves at the top of the cathedral, as well as in a pretty dark Metro subway station.

I was looking for something decently priced and with some good features, specifically 1080p/i video recording. I thought this was the perfect camera. Don't get me wrong, it is good and the picture quality is decent, but I'm very disappointed. The HD video is great but the audio has a very distinct humming sound. At first I thought the camera just needed a new firmware update. But it already had the latest version. So then I recorded some more footage and got the same thing. I also want to point out that since the stereo microphone is right by where you would normally hold the camera, I made sure to hold the camera carefully not to cover it up. I then went on to record in 720p MP4 format, thinking maybe its the AVCHD format. NOPE. It does the same thing. I also have a Sony Bloggie and it records perfectly with awesome sound. So much for getting a camera that records HD video and looks as great as this camera. It's going to be returned :(", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING CAMERA!

I typically stick to compact cameras because I want the capability to take it wherever my heart desires and with a huge SLR camera it just wont work. I must say that this camera is slightly TOO big, but it still fits in GUY style pants, def not for a woman's pant pocket. The Camera has multiple shooting versions which is amazing! I was really surprised at how many options there where, especially when most the comments said there were hardly any. I highly disagree with this because I used to own a NIKON S230 and I have to say this Sony is WAY WAY Better! I love the feeling I get from spending money on something well worth it, like a good dinner or lunch and I must say I am happy to give my money to Sony for this camera. I am college student so it means alot when a college student says he is happy to give up $200. The movie recording is just AMAZING I mean I have never seen anything like it. So realistic and amazing quality. The other amazing feature is the paranamic photo assistance. On my old camera I hated the fact that I had to snap a picture move the camera line up the images snap another photo, move camera line up, etc. With this camera you just hold the shutter button and move he camera horizontally. Just an amazing experience with this camera. And to be honest it really is the BEST compact camera you will find anywhere especially with the price. Lastly, the photo quality is amazing, I really don't know what everyone is complaining about but the noise is minimal and the quality in a decently lit indoor environment is just breath-taking. I mean I compared the photo to a Cannon SLR and I really saw no difference even after zooming. I highly recommend this camera to anyone on a budget and needing a good camera!

After selecting the Mode you want with the dial you simply press Menu to access the features that can be changed.  I prefer the Program Mode because it seems to provide the largest number of options that can be set, like adjusting white balance, lowering or raising EV setting, and changing the metering and focus widths, among many others.I took OK shots during a concert with some of the scene modes and the Automatic mode but none were great.  I then tried a few different scene modes while playing with the Menu features and was able to substantially improve the shots.  For example, Portrait Mode with a tightened up Focus and Metering, while significantly lowering the EV setting produced excellent shots of a band performing on a spotlight illuminated stage.The HX5V is a fun camera because you can easily access lots of features.  Not all features are available in each mode so experiment!  I also found that turning the flash OFF produced much more pleasant results.

The image quality is seriously amazing.  I was a little stumped that Sony put out a 10MP camera with all the latest tech in it when 12-16MP were coming way down in price.  Having a background in image processing I knew that 10MP is plenty for pictures (even blown up poster size), so I wasn't concerned.  I wanted the 10X optical zoom, optical stabilization, big display, and GPS.  I was amazing to see that a Sony camera could use SD cards and was a major selling point because I'd overlooked Sony's because of the expensive MS in the past.The automatic image detect works better than I expected, but you'll have faster response if you put the settings in manually.  Sometimes they yield a nicer picture as well.  Focus is very quick, all the canon and casio cameras I've used seem slow in comparison.  Face detection, smile detection, etc. aren't that great (aren't on canon or casio cameras either), but I have the settings for those set pretty low.The reviewers that said they have low light problems must be using a different camera or have their settings way off.  I've taken night pictures and sunset pictures and all look great.My parents have a Canon G9 (once Canon's best non-DSLR), and this thing takes way better pictures.The GPS works, but it's a little slow to pick up signal so some pictures don't get tagged.  Sony improved this with a firmware update.  I haven't used it much since then, so we'll have to see when I go vacation again.As for video...  Yes, you have to use PMB to get the video off the camera.  Ok, it's not that bad since the camera has a portable version built into it.  PMB is just an alright file manager.  The quality of the video seems a bit better than my sister's Flip HD, but the stabilization on video isn't great.  I always end up with slightly unstable video.  Not a big deal, the Flip style ones are basically the same.One feature I didn't think I'd use was the panorama mode.  I was wrong!  That is the best panorama I've ever seen on a camera.  The stitching is seemless.  The only strange thing is that it puts a black bar on one side of the picture usually.  It's simple to crop out, but it'd be nice if it would do that by default.  I'm not sure why it adds that.One last thought...  Battery life is decent.

I had seen the sweep panorama feature on a friends Sony and liked it. Also, High dynamic range multiple exposure/automatic image combination was appealing feature.  I recently took this camera on a shoot in British Columbia.  I am totally pleased with it in terms of image quality and image color.  I enjoyed using the panorama feature, HDR and twighlight features.  I also found the video very useful.. just to shoot some clips to put the still images in context.  Because this camera has a backlighted Exmore chip, it also worked really well in low light.  image stabilization is ok, comparable to other P/S I've had, but not better either. Because of the size of the 10mpxl files and video files,  I used and recommend an 8gbyte SD card.  My complaints about this camera are ergonomic.  For me the camera is hard to hold with one hand and often slips out, so be sure to keep the strap on your wrist.  I also do not like the placement of the shutter button.. it is too far away from the side of the camera, stretching your index finger to reach over the zoom button to fire it.  When shooting video, I find that to hold the camera steady I end up putting a finger from my left hand over the speaker holes on the top left of the camera.  Again, poor ergonomics.  Finally, the zoom range on the camera is less than what I should have bought.  For me it doesn't have enough reach and I will look for a 12x or 14s superzoom the next time.

Your fingers can easy cover the left and right stereo microphones.Two, change the shiny portions to glossy, the mirror shiny screen and sides of the camera might look less fingerprint smudged if they had a different glossy finish to them.Third, add the compass direction to the photo.  The GPS data is already there in the photo info.  The built-in compass should have that direction in the still photo, just as the GPS adds the latitude and longitude to the info.  If the compass info is in the photo information, it is not obvious enough to find.It is nice to see the compass move on the view screen, but does it record it anywhere in the photo?Four, the lens sticks out slightly even when closed.  If it went totally flat against the camera body it would be easier to fit in a shirt pocket.  As it is, it will fit in a pants pocket.Five, you have to buy film storage.Other than those shortcomings, this camera is fun and versatile.  A camera that has a panorama setting that is simple and automatically stitches the image together on the fly is amazing!  This camera does HD video very well.This is a 10.2 megapixel camera.  I know there are many 14 megapixel and higher resolution cameras.  The clarity of the photo doesn't 'wow' the casual viewer but it gets the job done with good regular sized photos of sufficient clarity.  Higher megapixels are for poster sized photos.  I don't print that many movie poster sized photos, I don't know about you.  I like that even without any storage, you can still save a half dozen photos to the built-in camera memory.I like that there is no reason to have a lens cap.  The lens retracts behind a good cover.Unless you get out the magnifying glass often or think you are buying a digital SLR camera with 20 megapixels, you will like this camera.It is a good all around camera that has intelligence built in.

Finally in a compact camera I can take great indoor, dusk and evening photos when travelling.

I think it is the ultimate travel camera. You have the wideness (25mm) and the 10x optical zoom. I was able to get some good shots moving in a boat in Costa Rica of some monkeys up in the trees. Everyone else was complaining how their point and shoots can not reach them and kept asking the boat driver to get closer; and they still couldn't get that shot! A person sitting behind me asked how I was able to zoom so far with such a small compact; they asked me what the model number was so they can purchase one.One of my most favorite feature is the 1080i video. I have taken so much video from my trips and have loaded them into my PS3. I also like how I can copy the videos on a thumb drive and taking it with me to my friend's house and show them our videos on their PS3. They were amazed on quality and how it zooms pretty far during video recording. Playing the original file on the PS3 is noticeably better in picture quality than after uploading it on a PC or Mac. On the Mac, it converts in to 30fps from 60.On one of our vacations, I let my GF use the Sony and I brought along the Canon S95 that I recently purchased and I found myself using the Sony more. Don't get me wrong... the S95 is an awesome camera... for pictures. Especially using the RAW format. Some of my best pictures from the trip came from the S95. But of course, it does not have a lot of the features the Sony has. Also, the video is not as fun as the Sony. I don't like the fact that it does not continuously focusduring video on the S95 and it stays fixed; like the focal length. But I do take the S95 when I want to get some spectacular shots which is what it is really built for.The only draw backs on the camera is the colors, some blurriness ,lack of aperture priority setting, and the sound quality in video. The camera seems to shoot a little to warm in indoor pictures and sometimes outdoors. Also when you shoot in low light, some pictures seem to be a little blurry since it is stacking pictures onto each other. The pictures are still good, but wish they were a little more clear.I heard Sony has addressed a lot of these draw backs in their new model... HX9V which comes out in April 2011. I would wait and read the reviews if you are considering the HX5. I am going to purchase the HX9! They have addressed the audio quality in videos, they added 1080P, 24mm wide, 16x optical zoom, the colors are more accurate and less warm, improved picture quality, better panoramic pictures, added defocus background on subject to give DSLR quality bokehs, faster focus, faster start up times, and more!Overall, this camera has been perfect for me on vacations.

I can only say that, as a die hard Leica film camera guy, this little unit is pretty amazing. For most shots, all one need do is point and shoot. The results are nothing short of superb. The effects of the camera's noise reduction in terms of revealing less detail than one might want can be somewhat mitigated by using the unsharp mask in your photo software. But as far as being able to take no-brainer great pics, this camera rocks. I haven't yet delved into the video side of things, but given the quality of the lens and the photo side I expect nothing less than stellar results.Insofar as my Leica and the use of film, they still have their place. I shoot Kodak Professional Ektachrome transparency film and have the slides scanned to disk. While this is nowhere near as convenient as my little Sony, I have yet to see a digital camera at any price that can take landscape photos like my Leica. Landscape photography really puts a camera to the test, with all of the myriad details and the sheer scope. Plus, Ektachrome slides are a hard copy that can be archived.But I must say that for everyday use, this camera holds its own quite well, using just the \"Intelligent Auto Program\" mode, which selects the parameters needed for a great shot, given the conditions. There are, as discussed elsewhere, other modes, but most folks who simply want to grab the camera and capture the moment would find it difficult not to take a great, well balanced shot using \"Intelligent Auto Program\" mode.One more thing: I first looked at the Sony DSC-TX7 [ASIN:B00328HR7G Sony DSC-TX7 10.2MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Zoom with Optical Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.5 inch Touch Screen LCD (Silver)]], and was similarly impressed with the quality of pics it snapped. However, after actually holding it in my hand and trying to snap a pic, I found that it was so small that I had trouble doing so comfortably. Plus, its touch screen, which occupies the entire back of the camera, holds all of the controls, making it very awkward to operate.IMHO, the DSC-HX5V beats it hands down for ergonomics, plus it has a 10x optical zoom vs. the 4x of the TX7. And GPS, to boot! The only comparative disadvantage will be when zooming while shooting video, as the HX5V will record the noise of the lens zooming, while with the TX7, there is no such noise due to its different construction.Just buy the DSC-HX5V.

I was looking for a nice compact point & shoot type of camera with better than average pictures and features. The cameras I looked at in the $200-300 ranges all seemed to have some picture weaknesses of one thing or another. This camera addresses many of these other camera shortcomings primarily because it has more settings that you can manually change. However, this also makes the camera more difficult to use. I am not a camera expert by any means, but to make full use of this camera I think is going to require some basic exposure/light setting knowledge.The HX5V does very well indoors and with poor light. I took several pictures and was impressed. It really doesn't need much light to get a good picture without flash. Taking a picture of my cat, I needed to use the SCN Pet setting to get a good picture. In regular Easy setting, it gave the reflection on the eyes.I like the multi frame mode which allows you to take 10 pictures in a couple seconds. But with this it takes an additional 15 seconds to write the pics to your memory card. One gripe I have is they only include about 300MB of memory which is only about 9-10 shots in high mode. To use this camera you basically have to get a high end SDHC or Sony Memory Stick HD Duo of 16-32GB so consider that when you go to buy.Outdoor pictures is where I'm a little disappointed with the HX5V. Just setting the dial to SCN mode and choosing Landscape picture does not give a great outdoors picture. The sky isn't as blue as it should be, the details seem too dark and the color of grass and trees is too light. So that led to going thru the PDF manual. The biggest things I've played around with were the White balance and the Shutter speed and Aperture. You can change the speed and aperture by choosing Manual and Program modes. Changing the Aperture is pretty simple since it only has a few choices. Changing the Shutter speed is difficult because it gives a very wide range. Also, the pdf manual doesn't explain any settings for using Program mode. I guess it should be self explanatory?I did take several pictures outside adjusting these settings and using HDR mode as well and was able to get some very nice pictures even though the trees don't have leaves yet and the grass isn't yet green. I will have to keep playing with these settings and its difficult yet for me to pinpoint which setting to use for different kinds of pictures.I also did a couple of quick video recordings and they seemed to come out good. I've never had a camera that can do video so I have nothing to base it on. And the GPS feature is cool but a minor feature to me. I do look forward this summer in using it though.To sum up I would say for sure this is a great camera and has an excellent form factor. If it was any smaller my fat fingers would probably be too challenged to use it well. The 10x zoom is great and that was one of the big selling points for me, I didn't want a 4x zoom like many point & shoot cameras. I think this is a great camera but it won't take the great outdoor shots in the same manner as a $1000 dSLR. For indoors and in poor lighting this camera shines.Its difficult to buy a new camera because of the way they market them. I think its ridiculous that Sony, Canon, Nikon etc. all seem to have dozens of different point and shoot models to choose from.

Over the last year I've been looking to replace my Sony camera after 10 years of dependable and rugged use.  I almost bought a Canon G11 earlier this year, but held off for several more months after I heard that Sony announced the HX5V.  I have been a hugh fan of Sony for decades, 90% of my electronics are Sony, but this camera is a HIGH dissapointment.  You came so close to succeeding but somehow you lost it in the end. It's like you had a great vision, great plans, but when it came right down to it, you cut corners big time on the quality.  Sort of like what Toyota is did, got lost with their quality control.This is a point and shoot camera for \"Outdoor Only\".  For indoor pictures you have to keep playing with the settings get the colors somewhat close to being accurate, which defeats the purpose of a point and shoot.  By the time you take several pictures and make several changes to the setting after each picture, \"The Moment\" is never captured.  Any indoor  \"moments\" that were taken, the totally inaccurate color makes the picture too ugly to share with others.  That is especially  true with any florescent lighting, extremely tedious to try correct the color.  And as soon as you switch to video, it's like looking out of a fish bowl.  Top and bottom lines are curved, no matter how it's zoomed.  But if you're not shooting topics with any straight edge items in the picture, you'll be ok.  I thought Sony finally got it right, with the compact size, SD memory, resolution, zoom, and video option.  But it was such a let down with the fish bowl effect, and the totally inaccurate indoor pictures.Have been considering the Canon G11 which really shines in closeups and macro, but that's not my life.Come on Sony, new devices are suppose to improve from previous, don't add in extra features which are worse than 10 years ago.  Would have been miles ahead if you would have cut out the video option and keep the quality of accurate indoor pictures.  Flash level setting is not adjustable either. The door for Battery/Memory card is very flimsy, probably will break after a year of veery gentle use when changing the battery or memory card if you're lucky. I can also see it getting broken if it slips out of you hands and lands on the table you're sitting at.  If it drops to the floor, it's not a case of  \"if it will break\",  it'll be a question of  \"how may pieces\" will it break into.I've only written 1 or 2 reviews in my life. Reading other peoples reviews have helped me to think of numerous thing to consider, so I thought I would provide some feedback since this camera was such a big dissapointment.

That brings a little bit of DSLR to this point and shoot, and it's a great added feature!Additionally, I loved being able to upload my pictures, and have the GPS automatically map the photos where I took them. The only feature that I'm not sure of the usefulness of (yet) is the TransferJet capability. I'm not really sure of the purpose of it, as I'd never encountered other electronics that are TJ enabled. So this feature is pretty much lost on me.In the end though, this is definitely worth the purchase.

The small \"grip\" area in front works surprisingly well even though it's not covered in any anti-slip material.-Picture quality seems to be good so far, in different lighting conditions and locations (both indoor and outdoor), using the default auto setting (Intelligent Scene Recognition - the green letter \"i\" with the camera icon next to it on the camera's mode dial). Of course, you shouldn't expect miracles from such tiny sensor but I think the quality is good for majority of people seeking a fully auto \"high zoom\" camera. If you want to see samples, you can find plenty of them on Flickr or different \"professional\" review sites, same goes if you want to know stuff like noise levels at different ISO values or other nonsense like this (which is irrelevant to me since I got this camera for \"point-and-shoot\" usage only).-Video quality is also very good, especially at maximum resolution setting (1080i at 60 fps). Of course you can use optical zoom while filming and since the zooming is somewhat \"slow\" during filming there's almost no \"noise\" from zooming motor that gets into recorded audio. Unlike the picture mode, you can modify the optical image stabilization settings in video mode (you can leave it in \"standard\" or more aggressive \"active\" mode), though just like in picture mode you can't turn off the image stabilization completely (not that you'd ever want to).-There's a useful and very user-friendly \"panorama\" mode which can create horizontal and vertical panorama photos very easily, all you have to do is to hold the shutter release button and move the camera to the right (or left, or whatever non-default setting you chose) until the camera indicates to release the button.-The camera's 3\" display, while being somewhat low-res when compared to comptetitor's models (and newer models of HX series), is actually pretty useful for judging the overall quality of taken photos, both indoors and outdoors in moderately strong lighting.-Battery life is also very good, I've taken many photos (probably more than 50) and made several video clips in different modes and played with different camera settings and the battery life dropped to about 50%. Sony rates this camera at approximately 310 photos/charge, and I don't think this number is far away from truth.-In terms of overall speed the camera is also pretty satisfactory, there's a very little delay (I didn't time it) between turning the camera on and it being ready to shoot, same goes when switching between shooting mode and \"playback\" mode. I've heard some people complaining about that but I definitely am satisfied with the speed I am experiencing.-It has a built-in GPS sensor with ability to add GPS data to your photos. There's not much \"tweaking\" you can do for it, only turn this feature \"on\" or \"off\" or let it automatically update camera's clock, but it works good for a purpose of seeing the location of your photos on a map (if your photo management software supports it or if you're using the included Sony's photo management application). It takes fairly long time for GPS to acquire the signal once you turn the camera \"on\" but you can speed the acquisition time a little bit if you'll use the included photo management application to upload the GPS ephemeris data (or \"GPS Assist Data\" as Sony calls it) to camera's storage (memory card or built-in memory), though this data expires every month or so. Personally I keep this feature \"off\" since I generally know where exactly am I taking each picture and I don't really share them aside from family and few close friends.-The camera seems to work perfectly with the Eye-Fi Connect X2 WiFi memory card.Some not-so-good things I've observed:-The location of flash lamp is a little bit inappropriate since it's easy to accidentally cover it with your middle finger when \"gripping\" the camera, so be aware of that when taking the photos requiring flash usage.-As I've mentioned before, the door covering battery and memory card slots feels a little bit flimsy. Perhaps it just feels that way and in practice it will function perfectly for many years to come...That's basically all that I've noticed so far.

The stereo microphones work great as long as you make sure you are not covering them with your finger (odd placement I will admit).  Overall a solid feeling camera.  Battery life is acceptable, but if you are going to be out all day I would suggest an extra battery/car charger.  The panorama mode is great fun and can be used indoors for some creative shots (a group of people sitting around a round table can all be in the same picture), although you must be careful that you do not change the angle of the camera while shooting panorama because the camera may not put the picture together perfectly.Cons:1) Odd placement of microphones can turn a good video into a disappointment.2) No standby button (shuts the lcd off between shots to conserve battery life) that I could find.3) Depending on the type of lighting (fluorescent/incandescent), even if it is bright enough, the colors may not come out correctly.

The biggest disappointment in the HX5V for me, is in its iSweep panorama mode. It is absolutely amazing!  Worked great the 1st time I tried it.  However, the iSweep mode failure is its small resolution size.  While I stitch 360 or 180 degree shots with hi-resolution and file sizes of 50-75 meg, the nice,  but small panorama the Sony provides comes in around 3-4 meg jpeg file.

Battery life very good and I use a SD card-8 gig.  I do think the video is also great, even in low light.

However the only things I don't like are: the video button is too close where you hold the camera on the back and I click it by accident sometimes. Also the picture taking button should be where the dial is to choose your settings so you don't have to reach over to take the picture and thirdly, the transfer of pictures with the cord isn't the easiest to plug into the bottom of the camera, I'm used to a easy share camera, also when you transfer the pictures if you don't turn off the camera when you are done the battery useage gets sucks down quicker.I love the photos, excellent!!!The video is excellent and you can zoom in and out while taking the videos.Videos on our 60\" tv from the camera alone are outstanding!!Its a great camera.We got a 32GB card and it was $132 which is alot but worth it in the end.

Heinemann \"BH\"", "ReviewID": "R1GTX0QZ6PRHKB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my Sony W100, and really wanted the GPS for use with iPhoto on the Mac.  I had read the reviews of other GPS cameras and noted the problems people had with shortened battery life and long lock times.  That being said, I think the Sony was the best choice.  I was waiting to read the reviews of the Casio EX-h20g, but it didn't come out in time with any reviews for my trip so I went with the Sony. My expectations were basically be as good or better than my W100 and do good on the GPS.After 2 weeks in Hawaii on 4 different islands, I have to say I really like the camera.  GPS lock in the wide open was maybe 5 to 10 seconds top from turning on.  You can start taking pics as soon as you turn on, but the GPS will use its last coordinates if you don't wait for the update.  I also like that it will update the internal clock with the time difference based on GPS as well.  One thing to note is that it does not embed GPS coordinates into movies, but iPhoto lets you paste location from other photos.If you move a great distance (like from US mainland to Hawaii) it can take awhile for the first GPS lock, but the camera has a setting in the menus to set your home location and one destination location. With that I set Hawaii as the distination, and it got a faster lock once we got there.  Also, to help get a lock faster, you can load GPS assist data on your memory card from the web, and it uses this to get locks faster.  The bad thing is that the software to do this is for Windows only.  I found instructions here: [...] for doing it on the mac, including a link in the comments for a program for the mac that would do it automatically.  I had to create a folder first on my memory card for it to start working but after that it worked great.  The GPS assist data is good for about 30 days at a time.Loved the Panorama mode, just press the button and rotate the camera to get a panoramic view.  The faster you rotate the camera, the more you get, if you go slow, it will cut off the panorama.Picture quality was good, and the zoom works really well.There are two modes for video on the camera, avchd and mp4. If you have it set to avchd, you can't import automatically to iPhoto, you have to use iMovie to do the import and it can't seem to delete them from the card.  If you set to mp4, then it will import the movies just like it was an iPhone and works great.Battery life seemed to be good, I didn't charge the battery every night and never really had an issue. I did have a spare battery that I had to pull out just in case because I was doing lots of movie shooting and hadn't charged in 2 days.  That being said, I wasn't shooting lots of pics, only about 1500 over two weeks.Also, loved burst mode on this camera, where it will shoot up to 10 pictures in 1 second.  Was great for getting the whales and dolphins jumping out of the water.All in all, I think this was a great replacement for my Sony DSC-W100 camera, love the GPS, menus and functions were very similar to the W100.I wanted to add after reading the other reviews that complain about the GPS and included software that I'm didn't use any of the software in the box.

I have seen lots of equipment in the 40 years I have been in the visual communications business, and this little gem ranks near the top.  Addendum: I have used this camera for several months now, and have several additional comments.  While outdoor pictures are exceptional, indoor shots are not quite up to par.  There is a bias toward yellow when shooting auto mode indoors without flash, requiring a manual white balance. Moreover, the manual mode is severely limited, with only f3.5 and f8 settings.  Thus, indoor action shots without flash -- often the case due to the limited flash range -- will result in blurring because the f-stop opens to only f3.5. The ISO can be increased, of course, but the picture may become noisy. When shooting flash, there is a significant time lapse in shutter release.  If most of your pictures will be taken outdoors, this is a no-brainer.  You can't go wrong with this camera.  If most of your shooting will be indoors, it's still a good choice, but may not be the best.  That said, no point-and-shoot is going to perform like a high-end SLR.

I went to the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX5V because I was looking for a camera that I could fit in my pocket while traveling in South America over the summer, but that would also take great quality photos. I naturally gravitated towards the Sony since I have the Sony digital SLR (since I am a fan of Minolta cameras and Sony bought their technology out several years back).So, what do I like about the camera?1) It's very lightweight. It easily fits in the front pocket of my jeans without being obvious.2) Picture quality is great. The \"anti-motion blur\" setting is amazing--where multiple simultaneous frames are taken and then cobbled together to make an in-focus shot! Takes pretty good panoramic pics as well--have to search hard to find the \"seams\" of the photo where it was put together. There's also a backlighting setting that's pretty useful.3) I'm not that big on video, but this camera has a full 1080 HD video which has really great resolution and sound. And there is no camera/video shake--I don't have the steadiest hand, but somehow it always looks really smooth like I used a tripod! On that note, there is great image stabilization on just the normal picture shots.4) Battery life is pretty good (unless you are taking a lot of video of course--that always depletes the battery more)What could be improved...1) The video is very high quality, so it does take up a lot of MB on your card--so I'd advise having a large (16-32 GB) card or multiple ones with you if you're going to shoot a lot of video. And there's a mechanical noise that you can hear on the video (I think mainly when you're trying to view it on the camera) when you zoom in and out on objects while filming.2) Having to remove the battery before you can remove the memory card. Just a bit inconvenient, but not that troublesome.3) Flash photos aren't always the best, but I think that is an issue with most point-and-shoots.4) Camera seems to be a little \"light hungry\" at times and this results in some overexposed photos.Bottom line: there are things that I'd rather take with my digital SLR since most point and shoots, the Sony included, can't do justice to them.

You can either put it in \"intelligent mode\" and use it as a simple point and shoot, or you can choose from other options that allow you to have more control over the picture you're taking.3)  It has some great modes.  I have found the \"panoramic sweep\" mode, which takes multiple photos of a panorama and then stitches them together in a single image, to be particularly nice.  I also found the \"backlight correction\" mode extremely useful.  When you put the camera in this mode and then press the shutter, the camera takes two pictures in very quick succession, with the pictures being at different exposure settings.  The camera then stitches the two pictures together to create a single image where the exposure is good across the entire image.  This is a really useful mode for taking images of people outdoors.  You end up having images where people's faces are at a good exposure level without the background being washed out.4) The photo burst mode is also nice for catching action shots.5) It's nice that you can use the zoom while shooting video.Cons:1)  It can be quite difficult to see what you're shooting on the screen if you are shooting in very bright light (e.g. the Arizona desert).  A feature I didn't think was important when I chose this camera, but will definitely place a priority on when choosing my next camera, is a view finder.  It may sound old fashioned to want a view finder, but it really can be hard to see exactly what you are shooting in bright sunlight if you don't have one.  Several others in the group I traveled to Arizona with also had this same issue with their cameras.2)  The zoom makes a lot of noise if you use it when recording video.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "the perfect point & shoot at a great price", "Author": "Justin Smith", "ReviewID": "R127Z2WLMK2G3K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this camera and have been very impressed. It's not on the level of a digital SLR, but I'd rather have one that is more portable and can fit in my pocket. The pictures look great and the camera is super-easy to use. Instead of having to manually choose different settings (macro, twilight, anti-blur, etc.) it automatically chooses the best setting for you. (Of course you can manually select it if you prefer). I've found it to do a great job figuring out how to handle different scenarios. Can't complain about the 10x zoom either.My one complaint is that the burst mode button is right beside the shutter button and can easily be mistaken by a novice (like when you hand your camera to someone else to snap a few photos). The video looks great, picture quality is incredible, even in low-light and action. The Sony replaces my 4 1/2 year old $300 Canon Ixus 70 (elph 70) and I am amazed at the leap digital camera technology has made in that time. There are many shots (night time, children playing, etc.) that my old camera couldn't handle that the Sony has no problem with. If you're a true videophile, you would be looking at a DSLR anyway, but for the rest of us, this is a great camera and a great value at $189.One more thing- the GPS feature was a major factor for me since I use places in iPhoto (by the way, this camera works great with a Mac). It did seem to take a little while to get a signal outdoors, but it did lock on and my pictures had the geotag info.

My original DSC-HX5V went \"surfing\" in Costa Rica when it fell out of my beach bag during a wet landing by Zodiac (camera was totalled from sand and water damage; pictures on memory card were saved).  It takes great pictures with relative ease and has a lot of bonus features that enhance my photo-shooting options -- from a very sophisticated point-and-shoot option to more creative options for specific needs, including a \"burst\" setting for rapid shooting and a movie mode.  When I went back to the retail store to replace the original DSC-HX5V, I found that in the month since I purchased the orginal, the model had been discontinued and replaced with a model with more pixels.  The DSC-HXV5 could be \"special ordered,\" but Amazon had it for about $100 less plus NO sales tax.  I did not want more than 10 pixels.  10 pixels will allow quality photo blow-ups to about poster size which is more than enough for most point-and-shoot applications, but there is a loss of picture quality with MORE than 10 pixels because the pixels are too small.  I've never had a Sony before -- always had Nikons -- and was dubious about purchasing from a company known more for their audio products than cameras.  My retail camera salesman was quick to point out that Sony is a pioneer in the field of digital imaging with the original video cams more than 20 years ago.  My last Nikon took AA batteries and it was always a pain to pack enough batteries for a trip.  This rechargeable battery lasts longer than the AA and it recharges quickly and easily both from a automobile power source and electrical outlets aboard ship and in Central America (but I would still purchase a second battery for extended photo sessions away from a power source).

The \"blur deter\" feature works very well... I was able to get some pictures of my parents' dog that have never come out clearly due to her \"wiggling\"...4.  The ability to do super macro and blur the background... a feature I've missed since the days of my SLR.5.  Very little blurring no matter how quickly I pulled out the camera and what situation it was brought into-- motion, low light, etc.The menu system was quite easy to understand, and that's from someone who didn't really like the complexity of the Sony menu system from back around the DSC-P72 timeframe.The build quality of the device is quite high and it feels good & solid in the hand. It's perfectly pocketable, and fast to start.It's been since my first digital camera, the Olympus D340R, that captured such a high percentage of perfectly crisp photos. And I've had a lot of digital cameras between 1997 and now.If you want a pocketable digital camera that is going to land you with a high percentage of good shots with minimal fuss, I fully recommend this camera.(I'll upload some photos I took with it as example shots)", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing little camera!", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "R7U2USZCP8AS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing camera.

Another is you change from AVCHD to MP4 in settings. Some have talked about the barrel distortion that occurs at high zoom levels or even without zoom.

That is impressive!This camera looks good, feels good (heavy-ish/durable), and is easy to use. It interfaces flawlessly with my Mac.

I mostly view the pictures on my computer and don't do much reprint. The 5MB image size setting suits my need and the camera takes less time to record compared to the 10MB setting.  I leave the dial at Intelligent Auto Adjustment most of the time.  We had several close-up group pictures with my wife sitting up front and several friends near the back about 5 ft away.  The camera detected all the faces and no blurry faces in those pictures.  The 1080 videos looked quite good when I viewed them on the computer monitor.  I was holding the camera in one hand and driving at the same time and the camera seemed to keep the video shoot very steady with hardly any jerky motion.  Love that Movie button. It makes it easy to record video -- press it to record and press again to stop recording.Two complaints.  (1) The camera doesn't stamp the date and GPS information on the pictures.

In good light the camera has excellent image quality.  It also has some cool modes that actually work quite well including the high dynamic range mode, ipanorama,  and especially hand-held twilight.  Thanks to HHT it is capable of taking low-light images of much better quality that you have a right to expect from a compact super zoom.

It's just small enough to fit in your pocket, so you can be ready for anything. I'm the kind of user who turns the camera on, snaps about three shots and turns it off again. What's great is that it turns on and off very quickly -- about one second -- and can take shots quicker than any other point-and-shoot I've ever used. Battery life is excellent. I always keep the flash turned off because I hate how it makes subjects look unnatural and washed out. This camera takes very good pix in low light without a flash, although shots get a little grainy the more you push it to the limit. The panoramic mode is fantastic and easy to use with a little practice. I especially love the backlight compensation mode, which takes two shots and averages them together when you're shooting a subject in front of a brighter background. The auto-mode can choose the best setting for you, but if you want a little more artistic control, there are dozens of options to pick from. The downside, if you can call it that, is there are so many different modes that it can be difficult to figure out what works best for your shot. I often take two or three identical shots using a different mode for each. Experimenting is part of the fun. If I had to nit-pick, I might complain that the auto-focus sometimes locks onto the wrong object and is hard to override. Also, the zoom control is a little stubborn to adjust in small increments and frequently zooms all the way in if you hold the lever a bit too long.

I feel like I can take some awe inspiring photos from this thing, but overall, it's all matter of preference, bias, lighting, etc. There's plenty of pictures from this camera that you can find under \"photos\", and if you'd like a more scientific comparison of camera quality, I'd recommend this site:[...]With that out of the way, I'm very delighted with this camera. Let me list the reasons:-Panoramas. I actually decided on a Sony for the \"sweep panorama\" mode. I'm a big fan of \"virtual tours\" (for instance, Google Streetview) and wanted to make my own. This would have been a nightmare on my previous camera - it could take an hour and ~30 photos to get a 360\u00b0x~90\u00b0 panorama. With this it takes 5 minutes tops for the same result (I include the time it takes to stitch photos together). Just click and drag, and the camera does the rest. The camera lets you take panoramas both lengthwise and widthwise, but only allows a max of ~225\u00b0 lengthwise and ~180\u00b0 widthwise, so you will still have to stitch photos together if you want a 360\u00b0 panorama. Still, you won't find another camera on the market that takes 360\u00b0 sweeps.Some feel picture quality is lacking on sweep panoramas. I have to disagree - if you know how much memory a full resolution panorama takes up, you might just welcome the convenience. There's also potential issues with motion blur, but if just go slow and steady and you'll never notice. Besides, if you find yourself disappointed, you can always stitch you panoramas like on every other camera.-Wide angle lens. Goes nicely with panoramas.-10x zoom. Can't get enough of that zoom.-Geotagging. This is actually a surprise feature for me - I didn't expect it would be of much use. Turns out its quite a boon if you're making a virtual tour and can't figure out where you've taken a photo.-Software. I usually just ignore proprietary software, but this has been an exception. You'll need the software if you want to use geotagging (from what I can tell), but the software seems well built and offers good features. You can organize photos as dates on a calendar or as points on Google maps, as well as tag and rate your photos. It reminds me of a photo journal, tracking where and when you saw something.-Easy mode. I was expecting to be a big fan of manual mode, and the camera does offer this feature if you're up to it. Turns out, though, that I take much better photos when I just ignore the details and capture moments as they pass. Naturally, your mileage may vary, but seriously consider this feature if you're just starting out.TL;DR The one and only camera for photo journals and virtual tours.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good pocket camera for stills and video - but get the correct SD card", "Author": "BigAl", "ReviewID": "RABDU379DNXHX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a couple of years now and I use it all the time. I probably should have rated this camera a 5 star, but I spent over a year being frustrated due to the lack of finding an SD card that would allow me to take movies with the camera. This camera not only takes still pictures but also HD movies. The problem is that HD movies require a lot of storage. I purchased a Patriot 32 GB SD card and it did not work in the camera. A lot has been written about this problem and there are many like me who felt I was suckered in to buying this by reading the Users Manual and figuring I could buy any Class 10 SD card and all would be fine.  Luckily several months ago I found a special price on a Sony SD HC SF-32NX Class 10 32 GB card which I bought. I placed it in the camera and I can take pictures and movies.  However, when I put it in my PC (Windows 7) it suggests I reformat the card. I ALWAYS say NO and I can then download the pictures and movies. In the picture mode I love the iSweep Panorama setting when taking pictures of a large group of people.  However, once in a while it does not connect the segments properly and one person's face can get distorted.  The solution is to take multiple pictures of the group and hope that you get one with a good scan. The camera size is great for me as I can put it in my shirt pocket and walk around hands-free not having to lug around a camera. The low light setting is not bad, but I have seen other people with different cameras taking brighter pictures in the same low light setting. Overall I am happy with this camera now that I can take a movie or two during times when pictures alone do not capture the moment. If I were to purchase this camera today I would make sure that I can also purchase a 32 GB Sony SD card at a reasonable price along with it.

The GPS works very well and it is easy to operate.After using it for 7 months and taking some 1500+ pictures with it I am very disappointed with the focus, it takes AGES to focus between pictures, specially if you shoot people, social gatherings, babies or infants and need it to work on \"take the camera out quickly and take a picture\" moments...it takes a lot to turn on, load and focus, it even takes the pictures if you push the camera too hard and accepts them as OK without them being focused. So you find out about that when you see them in your computer...Video recording is not good, it doesn't have auto focus so when you move the camera it goes out of focus, refocusing when you reach the subject and don't move. In the natural position of the hands when gripped, you would be putting your finger on top of the mic for video recording and then find out that sound is very lousy, so if you take videos, make sure you do them holding the camera with your right hand only.I give it 2 stars as it does take OK pictures, video quality is also normal if not moved at all and GPS is a good feature.

I prefer how they work.  I've owned and used most of the other major brands, but for point and shoot I'm still a Sony fanboy.  Sonys get the exposure and color balance better than the Canons I've owned, especially for flash pictures.But this Sony has disappointed me.  Maybe it's just me - I have this funny quirk, when I press the shutter button on the camera, I expect the camera to take a picture.  Weird, I know, but I'm just picky that way.  It shouldn't take two or three tries.It's most noticeable when the lighting conditions are low.  By the time the camera takes the picture, the moment has passed.  And sure, it takes nice pictures out in the sunshine, but so did my 1990s 1.2 megapixel camera.The zoom is also odd, it's doesn't respond well - it doesn't zoom enough, or it zooms too much.The camera has a ton of amazing features.  If you're not shooting low light pictures, or moving objects (like kids), or moving objects in low light - then it could be very good if you get it when the price is discounted.For some uses this could be a great camera. The flash works well for a camera this size.  And the zoom lens gives you a lot of flexibility.  So as a work camera, or something like that, it could work very well.  When the light is good.  Things that don't move too much.  Buildings, and stuff.A lot of new cameras have come out since this was released.  It was groundbreaking then, but it's not that competitive any more.

We're not after professional pictures, just something to reliably document our family events and outings, and this fits the bill perfectly.Here's what we like:-Super easy to use.  When set on the intelligent setting, the internal computer seems to get the picture right every time.  When it's not sure of the lighting, it takes two pictures with different settings so you can compare and discard the one that looks wrong.-Perfect size.  Small enough to fit in any pocket, we take this everywhere.  The picture quality is much better than the iPhone 4 and while I didn't want to carry both, it really wasn't that uncomfortable to have my phone in one pocket and the camera in the other.  Because it's not one of those hellacious sized SLR big lens things, we really could have it with us all the time, get it out in a second, take a great picture, then put it back in the pocket.  We never miss a photo opportunity.-Works great with iPhoto and iMovie, at least with an SD card.  Both programs read the pictures and movies right off the card and there is no need to plug the camera into the computer.-The smile detect is a nice feature that is fun to play with especially with the kids.-The HD video looks great both on the computer and on the TV.  There is a dedicated video button on the back of the camera that makes shooting video so easy.  The camera takes such great video we no longer use our Sony DV Handicam at all.-The screen on the back is very easy to see in all light and since we aren't professional photographers, it doesn't bother us that there is no viewfinder.  All of our Canon digitals had viewfinders (I think we went through three Canon digital elph models) and we never ever used them.Some things we don't like so much:-The wheel for changing the shooting modes is easy to get nudged and while we would be happy to keep it at the automatic intelligent setting, we often find it has been accidentally turned to some other setting.-There is a little burst shooting button on the top of the camera and it's very close and similar in size to the on off switch so it's easy to hit it accidentally.  The burst pictures are still fairly good quality so that's not the problem for us, the problem is that when it shoots in burst mode (where it can take up to 10 quick pictures) it takes forever to write to the SD card, so you have to wait a while to take another picture.We would recommend buying a second battery so that you can swap them and always be ready with a fresh one when you run out to that kid's award ceremony or weekend getaway.  The battery lasts through a whole day of pretty intensive picture and movie shooting for us.  I don't think we have ever run out of power mid-day.We love this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for something quick and easy to use that's small enough to be taken anywhere.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great camera for the casual photographer", "Author": "Laura Latigo", "ReviewID": "RWITATRWZFLC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony Cyber-shot may not be the latest and greatest camera on the market today, however its features and ease of use make it a very good camera for the causal photographer.

I wanted to color correct for the clouds, but the intelligent backlight feature has no manual white balance. I did meter using the intelligent mode and try to set my shutter and aperture using those setting and then a manual white balance, but I lost the HDR shooting of the intelligent mode.But as I knew this going in from other reviews, I can't begrudge the camera for performing as advertised. What's amazing is the low light and HDR features in the intelligent mode, even when the camera is none too steady. My only complaint is that it's way too easy to shift the camera out of the intelligent or easy shooting modes into the manual mode. I wish the selection dial had a push in and turn, rather than just accidentally turn.And as I'm sure a lot of people have found, it's just too easy to accidentally starting shooting video.The panorama feature also works like a charm, although the vertical resolution is limited to 1080 pixels, and so I found myself shooting a lot of regular photos and stitching them in PhotoShop. The HX9, I believe, shoots higher resolution panoramas, but again, I knew this going in.In general, a wonderful camera especially at the now much reduced price as a discontinued model.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Last Man Standing", "Author": "HonestAbe", "ReviewID": "R3ACOZJ3YH9DM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the last 11 months i have had 4 cameras all bought new.

The pictures are very sharp (keep in mind this is a point and shoot), Panoramic is seamless, Low light is excellent, and the stability feature comes in handy.  I strongly believe this is the best P&S; currently available.  One thing to think about, before i bought this one i looked at the 16mp model too.  It was actually like 20 bucks cheaper.  However i read an article stating that more megapixels can be detrimental to picture quality.  In a nutshell P&S; cameras all have chips( ccd or cmos image sensor) that are about the same size and so what happens when you take two chips of the same size and double the amount of pixels on one of them.  The only way to add more pixels in the same space is to make the pixels smaller therefore each individual pixel actually receives less light.  So that being said, the sensor with twice as many pixels actually picks up less details because of the loss of light to each pixel.  I'm not saying that a 5mp is better than a 10mp but more like anything over 12mp probably starts going down in quality( point and shoot camera).  I read a lot of reviews were people complain that their 5 year old 6mp camera was better then their brand new 15mp camera.  I'm no expert, this is just my observation.

So I decided to try this Sony HX5v which had great reviews. I mainly use my cameras to take pictures of kids + videos. And most reviews praised its fast speed, and excellent video quality (and the ability to zoom while taking videos). This is just a bit bigger than the small Canon SD series, but fits easily in any Jeans pocket (my criteria for size).I have used this camera for a camping trip, for fireworks, and for indoor shots. So far, the pics have turned out great in general. The speed is fast, and video looked good. The battery life has worked well so far.- I have compared the pics to a Nikon D90 DSLR pics taken for the exact same shots from adjacent locations, and I think Sony takes better pictures. The Nikon pics were too dark, not as vibrant in general.- Also compared to a Canon SD1200 pics for same shots, and Sony's pictures are way better - much sharper and colors much more vibrantSo I am very happy with the purchase. PROS: Small cam, great pics (better than a Nikon D90), good battery lifeBut I have noticed that few pics were a bit blurry (I have seen similar issue with my old Canon's) when kids move around.

Up to now I've been using my Panasonic Lumix DCM ZS7, which I upgraded to from my older ZS3.While I like the low light capture and think the HD video is excellent, I have to say that after comparing photos of the same scenes from both of my cameras side by side in Photoshop, the ZS7 generally takes sharper photos with better detail. The ZS7 never sold for anywhere near $200, but it was a good buy at around $280.In single burst mode the Sony has a surprisingly long lag time before the shutter can be pressed for the next shot. It's longer than for the Panasonic, which I thought was long to begin with.  The shutter button takes a little extra effort to fully depress, which is good if you don't want to accidentally take an unwanted shot, but not so good if you want to gently squeeze off a photo while keeping the camera steady.The Sony has a definite problem capturing the color orange. I have to adjust the hue scale quite a bit to get a more full or truer color. Overall I find the Panasonic color reproduction is more reliable.

My only criticism of the camera to this point is indicative of my experience with DSLRs (and their near-brothers/sisters like the Olympus PEN series)--the images in lower light tend to seem a bit soft, and the auto-function (now a standard on all point-and-shoot sorts of cameras) is not as sharp or blur-free as I might like. This is not to demean the camera's very real virtues and strengths. I guess, like many DSLR folks trying to 'move-down' the size scale (I can't wait to see the reviews of the new Olympus OMD-EM5!), I am hoping for more advanced image capacity in the smaller-sized formats.

Still quality is very good and video quality is excellent.

We don't put the camera through any real heavy usage though so your results may vary. I'll be very interested in how this camera will perform a year from now.But now I'm wondering what happened to the price? I bought this camera here at Amazon (this very product page) for $229.00 this past December. This was the regular price--no special sale price was advertised. Now it's $339.00?!? And here I was hoping to buy one for myself but it's definitely not worth it at that price. At $229.00 it was a fair deal but not now at $110.00 more.

I hope sony will update the firmwarre to maybe fix this, but not seen many digital cameras get updates like that, or maybe I just need to play with the settings more.....anyway, I really like the camera, but what good is it , if you miss the picture you are trying to take? Also, the video function seems fine, expect, it has a delay prior to starting after you hit record - and what I like about sony is you can zoom why you record...In summary, I would say nice camera, nice features, nice quality (for a pocket), but skip it based on delay....what good is it if you miss the moment.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "couldn't be better", "Author": "Jeanne M.

At that price, I'm looking at all the new deals on cameras and not feeling bad about my purchase.I expected everything but the great low light picture taking of the CMOS sensor (I never had that sensor before and now I won't buy another camera with a CCD sensor.). I also had lots of fun with the long exposure times available.The zoom is great, but I couldn't take a high def picture of the moon. Also, I couldn't even focus on to the moon unless it was a full moon. But, the zoom often surprises me with taking pictures at sport events and the environment.The videos are even better than still pictures! For some reason the focus while taking videos is more smart than taking still pictures. A focus that would take 30 seconds for a still pictures would take 2 seconds for a video. So, often, I just take a long video of something. The video is in full HD, so there is no problem with the resolution. Also, the zoom slows down while taking a video so you can't hear it and the sound quality is great(with a sample rate of 48000).There are plenty of features, but the mode I enjoy using the most is manual. It lets you directly control everything except for the focus. I don't even bother with the scene selections unless I'm taking pictures of the beach(they make blues very rich and vivid.). The panorama isn't as good as I thought; the focus isn't as good as a still picture, but it usually takes a smooth panorama even with a shaky hand. The optical steady shot helps a lot with this and with everything else. Shakes when taking videos are greatly reduced, but are still present.The picture quality did not amaze me, but I did like the lack of noise. Well, I can put the ISO sensitivity to 1600 and have no noise if the picture comes out bright enough. If the picture is still dark, there's lots of noise easily visible. There's always noise at 3200. Also, I wished the macro mode would focus to subjects closer, but, it didn't lie, it goes down to 5cm.I've had this camera for about 5 months, and a certain part of the screen is showing more light than other parts. So, I recommend buying a proper carrying case for this camera to provide better protection. The plastic build is solid and may make a noise when being pressed hard upon. I don't notice these issues when using this camera.Overall, I would regret to pay more than $200 for this camera compared with all of January 3rd's deals.

A little lacking in the batter life, but I bought extra batteries because I expected this.  I chose this camera based off of reviews that the shutter lag time was pretty good, and for the most part I would agree.  however, there are times when I want to take a quick picture, and it just will not take!  It seems to be an autofocus and flash issue such that i press the button all the way down, but the camera just isn't ready to take the picture so it doesn't :(.Another issue is just that the red-eye reduction flash is a little annoying.  It automatically kicks in if it senses a face in the picture, but there is just enough of a pause between the pre-flash and the picture being taken that the subject of the picture is already looking away or ends up with a funny look on their face.  This can be addressed by turning off red-eye reduction altogether, but that is not ideal.Now on to some positives... i like the single button to record as a significant reason for buying the camera was to take HD videos and those videos are very nice.  The \"special\" features on this camera are very nice to have, although don't always provide a lot of function.  The iSweep Panorama is very cool and works well, and the low-light options work well with still or slow moving objects, but the camera does pretty well with the low light even without some of those features.

That is in white balance.  In indoor, artificially lit situations, the images \"lean\" a somewhat overly saturated red.  No white balance setting totally fixes this, even with a custom setting. My Sony A100 has no issue with this, taking the same shots much more accurately.  Perhaps it's a quirk of the Exmor chip, or of this particular camera. (Photoshop to the rescue.)  Still, hands down, the HX5V is very nice camera and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony quality", "Author": "B.

I tried out several in store and read countless blog and video review sites. I felt I found the best balance of size, optical zoom and image quality and was proud to give it as a gift.  This ended the first time I connected it to the computer.While shots look great on the lcd and in photo viewer, when you view actual size at 100% there is no level of detail, blurred edges and overall fuzzy quality. I stood in my kitchen and took the same shot in every mode and not one was satifying. I called Sony customer service to see if I had it in the wrong mode and sadly he knew nothing about the camera. He just kept putting me on hold and reading off the website and telling me to try different modes. I don't expect SLR quality, but for a $300 point and shoot I had higher expectations. My 5 year old 4 MP Panasonic FZ10 takes shots with more clarity-though back then long zooms were twice the size.  While not a big deal, the transfer cable placement at the bottom is strange-you need to lay the camera down flat in order to connect to a tv or the computer. All my past cameras had a port on the side so it could stand up straight.On a plus side the feature set is great and the low light performance was as good as I expected and I loved that it includes a full size hdmi adaptor. If you want nice looking pictures for facebook or flickr then you will likely be quite happy with this camera. If you plan on taking them into photoshop or printing them out, you may be disappointed.

Here's how it ended up:The Losers: Nikon S9100 for poor build quality, poor video, and sounding like a tractor when you operate the zoom. The Sony HX7V for sea-slug slow shooting performance.Middle of the Road: The Sony HX5V, while connecting with a truly wacky proprietary Sony adapter, often takes very good pictures, is well-built, but is still noticeably slow compared to the Panasonic and Canon.The Winners: The Canon SX230 for speedy performance, manual controls, effective scene modes, outstanding stereo HD video, with its poor battery life the primary area of concern. The Panasonic DMC-ZR3 wins for its slimness, responsiveness, low price, and excellent battery life. Its low-resolution LCD screen is the primary weakness that might drive you to the latest model Panasonic, or step up to the Canon for more zoom, manual controls, and better video as well.When released (2010) the DSC-HX5V was a more competitive unit. Today, the low LCD resolution (230,000 pixels) and slow performance holds it back a notch. Still, I found it markedly superior to the later Sony HX7V and if speed is not important to you it is a well-built unit with good artificial intelligence. On close-out, a worthwhile camera.

It is beyond me why they would not allow this to be charged while plugged in to USB.  Maybe I was spoiled by my dock with my last camera but to have to take the battery out every time is just stupid.  And the charger that comes with it plugs straight into an outlet, no cord so I can't put it with the rest of my electronics. (edit I was able to run an extension cord and with some velcro got it some what user friendly)I guess it has been a hard adjustment coming from such a great little camera with solid aluminum body, tons of manual controls, a docking station to charge and transfer, quick startup and in-between shots.  I'm not used to having to wait like I do now between pictures.

This camera really shines in that department.Picture Quality is great but there is a serious loss of detail compared to my last camera as well.

This Sony DSC-HX5V seemed to be ideal, especially considering all its' capabilities and relatively low price.  I had been to a few Lady Gaga concerts before, but my iPhone and cheap digital camera couldn't shoot high quality pictures and videos.  Although the tickets state \"No cameras / Video Recording\", it seems that small cameras such as this Sony are allowed.  Just how much of a camera is allowed seems to depend on the venue: I saw security say no to a girl with a 35mm SLR camera in Vegas, but people had them in the Tampa show.  I initially was shopping for a HD camcorder but thought I'd regret that if I'm not allowed to bring it in.  Instead, I opted for this Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX5V because it looked like a simple camera, but actually was quite sophisticated and even shot HD video.  I practiced using the camera with the opening acts and thought it was working just a well as I had hoped.  I recorded a lot of the concert, only to later discover that the audio was terribly distorted, actually unbearable to listen to.  I was surprised by just how awful it was especially considering that the audio portion of my iPhone recordings was far superior.  I put together this video to demonstrate the problem in hopes that others looking for a camera for recording arena concerts won't be similarly disappointed.  This would be an excellent camera for just about any use other than recording in a loud environment.  Unfortunately, I'm going to have to send this back and continue searching for a camera that will meet my needs.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a good camera", "Author": "sharonjace", "ReviewID": "R17YVHVWMDOQDT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was hoping this would be a good camera, but the colors are totally washed out.

A full charge will get you about 2-3 hours of actual use and video will drain it quicker than that.

I especially wanted wide angle capability, 8-10x telephoto, and decent low light and flash photos in a pocket-sized package. I looked at Panasonic Lumix (discovered reviews with amazingly bad customer service and warranty coverage), Canon (ditto poor warranty coverage of consistent camera problems), and Nikon options of this ilk, read reviews of each, and then I discovered this Sonly model which seemed to be a better fit and with no horror stories about Sony's customer service. Unfortunately the camera isn't what I'd hoped for. Low light photos are pretty good as long as there's nothing in the picture that will move, or it will be a blur. Outdoor photos without flash were OK but I agree with other reviewers that the photos aren't quite as sharp as one would want and a little cool in tone. The flash photos, though, were terrible. No matter what settings I tried, and how I adjusted the white balance, flash photos were very harshly lit with poor color rendition. So after 3 weeks I sent it back to Amazon for a full refund. No hassle at all. Thanks!Which brings me to customer service in general. And I  hope someone from Panasonic and Canon reads these reviews. First of all, Amazon.com is absolutely first rate in customer service. No problems, no questions, no issues. I know that Amazon.com knows how to treat customers and because of that It will my first choice as to where to spend my money as long as that is true. But based on my extensive research on cameras as I was making this purchase I discovered that I WILL NEVER BUY A PANASONIC OR CANON PRODUCT  - cameras or anything else - because of the horror stories I found online from consumers who had to deal with their customer service agents regarding repairs on cameras under warranty. For example, I discovered that if you buy a Panasonic camera, for let's say $300, it has a one year warranty. If after a just a of month it fails to function correctly and you send it in for repair Panasonic has the option of just sending a replacement, re-furbished camera in its place but now the warranty on that replacement is only 90 days, even though your original camera was only a month old! What great way to market a flawed product and then fix problems by just constantly recycling the cameras with problems as replacement, re-furbished units while also cutting your warranty exposure by up to 75%!  And that's if Panasonic (or Canon) doesn't just avoid any warranty expense completely by just unilaterally declaring that any problem for which a camera is sent in for repair is the fault of the consumer and therefore not covered by warranty. No matter whether it's true or not - the consumer has no say in the matter. These companies just want to sell you a product, regardless of its quality and flaws, get your money, and then never want to see you or hear from you again if there is a problem. It's \"just go away - until you want to spend more money with us\".Well I'm sick and tired of consumers being treated like **** once they hand over the money. I will only deal with companies that have a proven track record of making reliable products, standing behind them, and treating consumers and their problems with respect, courtesy, and efficiency.Amazon.com, thank you very much. I'll be back.

You are searching for a super zoom pocket camera, right? You've narrowed it down to (as of fall 2010) this sony, the panasonic lumix s7 (or s10 something in Europe). So the short review.Amazing day time pictures, and sunset pictures. OMG. super easy to use, fast fast photos and the burst/bracket modes are crazy cool. the panoramic stitching 180degree setting takes unbelievable landscapes and is crystal clear. lots of default good settings to get the shot even through moving vehicles and airplanes.the bad, the night shots for people are kinda terrible. There are a few defaults and settings you can try over and over until you get a clear shot, but then the pic is gone and the people are tired of posing. It is so hit and miss. We are in Europe for a few years, so we take like a bazillion pictures. Just came back from the Canaries and got some amazing shots, even at night...like the masts of an old pirate ship...looking up at them to the sky, the camera, even in darkness got the perfect photo and picked up coloring that was just heart melting. But then, try to get a picture of your spouse at night, with any back lights and forget it.So, we were in Ireland last month for a week and our buddy had the lumix s5 and we had our olympus sw 720 (old but a tank). I had fought off spending on a camera, but his lumix totally sold us on the need...we just didn't know which to get. We considered a few different ones but narrowed the list, by features, to these two cameras. The sony had much faster bursts (great for action shots like racing down waterslides) and the sweet azz panoramic. The lumix did not have anywhere near those two features, but it had 14megapixels and 12 times optical zoom versus the 10mpix/10 opt zoom on the sony. If you don't think the mpix is important after 10, wait until your displaying photos on 42 inch old tv's because that is where technology is going....right?The cam is easy to hold, even with one hand, but the placement of the tripod mount is stupid...all the way to one side making it wanting to fall to oneside (gorillapod). Ofcourse, you just adjust your pod to compensate...but still...come on engineers.It's fast on and ready to shoot...like really really fast. Ithink faster than the lumix.I'm really glad we got this cam, but the night shots are disappointing...by a lot. This model has some different technology for this exact situation, and boasts superiority, but is about the same as the lumix...infact...I would give the lumix s5 (I dunno about the s7) a slight edge.To do again, I'd still buy this camera, but not hope for as much from the night portraits. The night landscapes are not bad because nothing is moving to blur the picture. Right...increased exposure time because of no light...somethign moves even a little....blurry faces.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not The Low-Light Performer I Was Hoping For", "Author": "John Vajda", "ReviewID": "R1EHH5C8T6SJDZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is no doubt that there's a lot to like about this camera. I saw it demo'd at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2010. I spent about 40 minutes discussing it with Sony's technical staff at the show, and I eagerly waited for its formal release in March.*IF* you're considering this camera specifically for low lighting, read on...I shoot often in very low lighting, and that was primary reason for selecting the camera. Here are some of the problems I had in low light:- Flash was too bright. This was the #1 reason I had to return the camera. There's no manual control to reduce the harshness of the flash. Even if the overall exposure is reduced 2 stops (-2 EV), faces are still washed out. This ran counter to Sony's reputation of having nice balanced foreground/background lighting.- Blurred subjects. Although the camera is a good low-light performer if the subjects aren't moving, the shutter is simply open too long for acceptable shots. I've used a number of small format cameras in nightclubs, and surprisingly the HX5V yielded very few usable shots. While testing the camera, it was very frustrating seeing people around me getting superior shots with other cameras, with or without flash.- Blurred background with a flash. Again, this was a result of the shutter staying open too long. In twilight mode we want the shutter to stay open long enough to pick up the background lighting, but my hand-held tests resulted in too many pics where the background lighting \"moved\" due to camera shake. Sometimes small lights in the background went right across people's faces in the final photo. Setting the ISO high and trying a combination of manual and preset scene settings didn't help. There really needs to be an option to capture \"some\" background lighting without the shutter staying open for so terribly long that the shot gets ruined.- Only Moderate detail captured. These cameras are equipped with Sony's premium \"G\" series lenses. My other low light compact is a Fuji FinePix F100fd. With the Fuji, I can crop a small portion of a photo and an amazing amount of detail is preserved. The Sony images are a little soft upon close inspection.I *really* wanted to like this camera more. Certainly nothing currently out there out-performs it avchd video recording (which by the way, does pretty well in low light). And the camera got a great review at imaging-resource.

The video was not great either. I was hoping better quality under general home lighting conditions. But definitely no the case. The video is very grainy.
