With the access holes on the top, it makes the installation a bit less tidy that I would like. Also the pig tails came up a bit short to reach some of the Siamese cables that went to the cameras and the DVR. It would have been much better if the holes were on the bottom. It would be really nice also if there was a power switch.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works Great", "Author": "James E.
