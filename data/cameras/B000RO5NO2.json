If you are looking for a cheap camera to get a kid started this is NOT a good idea. I bought it for that reason. I returned it because of the above. Yes, it is cheap, but you are way far ahead to get a starter Kodak or the like for $20-30 more.", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "this is one bad product", "Author": "kenneth sussman", "ReviewID": "RSR3OJ9XODGPD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought this and found it was sealed in that cut your fingers plastic. opened it put in the batteries.........nada........changed batteries .......still nada changed batteies again still nada........have returned...all I wanted was a 7 mp to update my carry always 3.2 which was then lost, and now found .....goodbye cheap piece of crap........ i swear major brands from now on!!!!!!!!~", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Grrrenade is cool!!!", "Author": "JJ \"JJ\"", "ReviewID": "R29YK43LRHPHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got a Grenade for my pup Ridley. The play and chew is cool, he's mauled the nylon chew part down to a stub. It's pretty tough. After a ton of chucking and chewng it's still in one piece unlike other toys that fall aprt right away! One thing I found is if you squeeze it before you throw, it makes sound all the way until it hits the ground. My pup loves that.

Well I was shopping online and I found the grenade by accident and decided that it was a quality product and bought one.  He (Winston) LOVES it. He doesn't put it down.
