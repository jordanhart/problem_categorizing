{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good buy for the price", "Author": "ag", "ReviewID": "R3UCCTEE0DY9HT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This DVR/monitor works quite well right out of the box.  Boots up into the program with camera pix.  Manual is very detailed and helpful.  For those with CCTV experience it's a breeze.  For those without, read the manual first.  Flow charts are helpful.  Live pictures are good, recorded pictures are better.  Zoom function works well.  Search function is intuitive, just like your vcr.  Can't beat the price.  The only reason not 5 stars is not enough experience with this product.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "19-inch LCD display", "Name": "Zmodo DVR-H9004UL-1TB 19'' Monitor with Built-in 4-Channel Pentaplex Real Time Network DVR with 1TB Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51d0rGxt0QL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004071UO4"}}
