{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Choosing among Canon digital SLRs", "Author": "G. Clark \"hogwallow\"", "ReviewID": "R2TYIQE8O208ND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon has three digital cameras for $2,500+. The 1DS Mark II, the 1D Mark IIN and the relatively new 5D. I chose Canon over Nikon (which I've shot most of my photographic life) because of Canon's more impressive suite of lenses. Here's the decision process I went through. As with most products, it comes down to how you'll use it. All of them have tradeoffs.1. Megapixels. More pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged (and cropped more tightly)with less deterioration. The 1DS is the market leader at 16.7MP, the 5D comes in at 12.7MP and the 1D at 8.2MP. If you're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1DS probably makes sense. If you're a wedding photographer, the 5D is probably the sweet spot. In practice, however, the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people. At 8.2MP, you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond the camera's native resolution. Up to that size, you certainly won't see much difference in prints from the three cameras. That said, the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude.2. Full frame. The 1DS and 5D are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera. The 1D and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor (FOVCF). For the 1D, it's 1.3X. What that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor don't capture everying the lens is \"seeing\" - it crops the view in a little tighter. The result: your lenses are effectively 1.3X longer. A 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on. Because the camera is effectively \"cropping\" the edges of the image that the lens produces, it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses. Whatever camera you use, what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get, and it doesn't affect the pixel resolution of the image. My 300 mm lens with a 1.4X extender and a 1.3X FOVCF is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory. (If you're switching from film to digital, some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the FOCVF. Your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm.)3. Durability. This was most important to me, though it may not be for someone who doesn't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years. Both the 1Ds and 1D sport complete metal bodies, sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200,000 cycles. The 5D - a very solid camera - is designed for 100,000, is not weather sealed and has more plastic components.4. Weight/size. What a solid, metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight. For those who prefer a camera with heft, these have it. For many people, this is a big drawback. The 1DS and 1D are 43 oz., or almost three pounds for just the body, without the big battery. Add the battery and you're at 54 oz. The 5D is just 29 oz. and 31 oz. with battery. The 1DS and 1D, with built-in vertical grips, are also more than 2 inches taller. If you're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around, the 5D is it.5. Speed. There's a reason the 1D is the camera of choice for photojournalists, sports and many bird photographers. It shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second, compared to 4 fps for the 1DS and 3 fps for the 5D. For most day-to-day uses, 3 fps is more than adequate. From using both, I'd say the 1D autofocuses a bit faster, too. The 1D has 45 autofocus points, compared to nine for the 5D.6. Price. Give or take a hundred here or there, the 1DS is about $7,200; the 1D about $3,900; and the 5D about $3,000. Price will determine whether you get the 1DS or not. If you can afford it, go for it. Otherwise, other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision.What did I decide? First, I looked at how I'd use the camera: photojournalism, travel and wildlife photography. The higher FPS was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed, so either the 1D or 1DS would do. In the end, I decided I'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera. (I bought the 300 f/2.8 IS for close to the difference in price.)So, I went with the 1D Mark IIN. If my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need a new car, I'd probably have gone with the 1DS. I'm VERY happing with the decision and the camera.For most people and most uses - general portrait, landscape and travel photography - the 5D is probably the way to go. (Or perhaps the next greatest camera that Canon will announce later this year.)", "Date": "January 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Worth the $$$!", "Author": "L C", "ReviewID": "R1K965WVCLBMJO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent camera!  I purchased mine in Feb. '06 and have used it continually for 2+ months before I decided to write this review.  First, I am an avid amateur photographer, and I wondered if this camera would be worth the expense, for a non-pro.  I've found that I do not regret this purchase in any way.  I researched it for several months and even bought the Digital Rebel XT first, thinking I'd rather not spend so much for a camera (I like the Rebel XT and it is a fun back up camera)....and I was confused as to which camera to choose.  Most official reviewers either did not review it, because there was not \"much\" difference btw. it and the ID Mark II or simply said that if you wanted to shoot sports or fast action, then the 1D Mark II N was the way to go.  I don't shoot those...I'm a wedding/portrait person.  However, I do also shoot landscapes and fast moving animals as well and wanted the weather proofing and speed that comes with the Mark II N.  So choosing between the 5 D, the (at the time) upcoming 30D and the 1D Mark II N was very difficult.One pro review site said that the Mark II N was a needless upgrade to the Mark II.  I found that an odd remark because Canon changed almost everything that they didn't like in the Mark II.  You can record both in RAW and JPEG at the same time, on different cards.  A 2.5\" LCD that can be magnified from any point, to check the sharpness, there is a definite absence of noise in shadowed areas and you do not have to pair this with an L lense to get excellent photos.  Aside from my L lenses, I use the 50mm 1.4, the 70-300 DO and the 85mm 1.8 with excellent image quality across the board.I am a small woman and found that the camera's weight takes some time to get used to.  However, the camera itself is so fast that it compensated any camera shake I might have had, due to the weight, by it's speed.  And, now that I am used to it, I hardly notice it.The multitude of control buttons can be confusing, but if you are used to the 1D Mark II, it's not a difficult switch.  If you are used to the Rebel XT, keep the manual handy for your first few times out.Whether you shoot in JPEG or RAW, the photos manipulate well in photoshop and you don't lose any quality (in my opinion) for not having the 12 megapixels of the 5D (which was 1 of only 2 reasons why I considered the 5D).  Large enlargments (16x20) print up quite excellently and again, you have the speed to NEVER miss a shot.  I've found that in shooting portraits with difficult to shoot subjects (children, pets, someone who DOESN'T want to sit for a portrait but his wife is making him...), SPEED does matter and often it's saved me from a failed shoot!The 1.3x FOV crop factor (vs. the full frame 5D) is definitely a factor to be weighed.  Frankly, I use the 17-40L and get excellent landscape photos.  As wide (at 22mm) as I could ever wish, and not get \"fish-eye\".  So, I don't find the crop factor to be a personal issue but it was something I had to take into consideration in my choice.  While it limits my 24-70L and my 24-105L to only 31.2mm at wide angle, it gives my 70-300 DO IS that \"just enough\" extra zoom boost (to 390mm) that I don't have to buy yet another expensive lens.I've been trying to think of the negatives of this camera, in order to give a balanced review.  As I said, initially the weight was an issue as well as learning the controls.  Both were quickly overcome.  The cost is definitely a factor, but especially for anyone who does this for a living, it is definitely worth the $.  I like everything about this camera (and I've gone through several others to get here).  When I don't have it with me, and find myself with my A620 (my \"in the purse\" emergency camera) I get so frustrated that the A620 won't do anything even close to what I've now come to expect as the standard for all cameras.  So I guess that's the one downside, because it's a large SLR, I don't carry it absolutely (though almost!) everywhere.  However, overall, unless you want to pay close to $7K for the Ds and the extra megapixels, I don't believe there's a better camera on the market.  I realize that while this review doesn't cover all the technical specs (you can get that on either cnet.com or the-digital-picture.com) I hope it helps someone like me who had a really difficult time making the ultimate decision.", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best Camera bar none", "Author": "Angelo Bovis \"angelo_bovis\"", "ReviewID": "R58BLBD491GDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Shall I go over all the features? No need.This camera will work anytime anywhere. It amazes me constantly. I'll be blunt. Any other camera (sorry) is garbage compared to the 1D.From being at the zoo and having to take an unexpected photo which is possibly due to its lighting fast startup and focus, to being on a boat in the harbor of San Francisco in the pouring rain while others run and hide with their cameras, to grabbing a 400mm night shot in Vegas with exceptional clarity thanks to low noise at high ISO and image stabilization - the 1D destroys any other camera.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awsome Camera", "Author": "Titus J.

Alkhamees", "ReviewID": "R15UXJJ6Q4YA3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This what i discovered when i've used my brand new 1D markIINWell, I have to say that I am truly impressed with this camera. A friend of mine got his about a month ago, so I have played with it a little bit, but since I got mine on thursday, I have really gotten to explore the many features and performance differences beween this camera and the 20D that I upgraded from.Having used a few original 1D cameras, a 1D mark II, the 20D with battery grip and a 5D, the size and weight of this camera really doesnt bother me (I have heard so many people complain about the size and weight before...) I actually really like the feel of the 1D mark II N. There is only a slight difference between the original 1D Mark II's feel and the N, but if you hold them side by side you notice it.The autofocus is absolutely stunning. Having used a 20D for a year and a half, I had forgotten how nice it is to have those 45 highly sensitive autofocus points! As soon as you pick up this camera and hold that shutter button half way down, you realize why this is the #1 choice of many of the best photojournalists.The body construction is the highest quality I have ever seen in a camera, but of course is very similar, if not identical to the other 1D series cameras. Compared to the 20D and 5D though, this thing just feels solid.Another stunning feature is, of course, the speed at which the 1D Mark II N can capture images... 8.5 frames per second! Just as the 1D and 1D Mark II have done for the past few years, this camera holds its own to all other cameras in its class, with 22 frame raw bursts at 8.5 frames per second. I hardly ever shoot jpeg, but i did test it and found the 48 frame buffer to be quite impressive. Packing two 2 gig Sandisk Ultra II cards (a CF and an SD) I have the capacity for about 450 total shots.The screen, of course, is fantastic, and blows any Nikon camera's menu and image review quality out of the water.The 1.3x crop factor is certainly an improvement over the 20D's 1.6x, and the bigger sensor definitely yields better image quality in low light due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio. Overall, color reproduction, metering, exposure and sharpness are all much better than the 20D.since i love wildlife photography I have been able to get 75% more caption information than I ever did with my pervious camerasThe camera performs great in the studio, and images are beautiful, as would be expected. I have yet to make any photographic prints from this camera, but I'm sure they will look stunning.", "Date": "August 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "You need this if you have kids", "Author": "vegevege", "ReviewID": "R1M3WDGUP7MZSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's taken a long time to discover this, but if you have kids, you really need a sports camera.  Like most first time parents, I started getting serious about digital slr's when we had our baby.  My first dslr camera was a rebel xt, then I upgraded to the 30D.  They're both fantastic cameras, but something was not quite right.  On a hunch, I recently bought the Mark IIn.  I finally have the right camera for the job.Children do not stay still.  The instant you point a camera at them, they will move (typically towards you), there are no exceptions.  So with that in mind, why are you snapping pictures of moving children with a camera designed for still studio portraits?  Exactly!  Wrong gear for the job.  You end up with about maybe a 5% keeper rate.  How many blurry or non-focused shots do you have?  How many shots do you have of moments just passed, and you missed it because you were waiting for your camera to auto focus?Sports camera such as the eos 1D series are made to shoot fast action... Like children.  The unit's auto focus with the ability to track moving subjects quickly means you will have a much higher keeper rate.

The camera is in \"Good\" condition and so far as I can tell only suffers cosmetic wear. I have taken it with me each day to test operation, sensor quality, button/dials, LCD's and battery life. I am pleased so far.I have shot with Canon equipment since the 1980's and still keep an EOS 1V so this model 1D (speaking in terms of setting the Mode, Speed, Drive, ISO, Bracketing, etc.) is more or less intuitive to the seasoned Canon 1 series user. Having other Canon Digital DSLR's has helped with navigating through the Menus accessed by the back buttons and LCD. Though operationally different - menu and image navigation differences are not insurmountable.This camera is more capable than my current Canons (30D & 20D) and I am excited to put it through its paces at my next shoot.Everyone wants the newest-bestest stuff - but in the absence of almost $7,000 for the new Canon Flagship 1D X, this affordable alternative is still enough to get the photography 'juices' going.

HOwever, 1d mark ii N shines when the low light, quick focus, good battery duarbility are required.The thing bothers me about the camera is not the size and the weight. It is the sensor dust. Why will a weather proof camera collects dust no differently from 30d? After 1000 pictures, the senor dust showed up.

I paired the camera with Canon 20-35mm 2.8L lens and went out to \"test drive\" the camera. After taking about few hundred images, I came back home and analyzed them. At first the images looked OK, but after looking them at 50% and over, I realized that every image has a weird banding issue. There were vertical lines with about 10 pixels spacing. I heard about some banding issues in the past with this model, but those problems were at higher ISO. My camera had the problem at any ISO, in both JPG and RAW format. I also tried different CF and SD cards, different computers to download images, different lenses, different setting, etc. Nothing could make the problem go away. I spent 3 hours with Canon technical support and they could not help me. I also noticed that the camera was underexposing 2/3 to 1, and that 580EX on this camera was working badly. It was almost impossible to find the right flash exposure. I compared the images from this camera and my old Canon PS G2 and G2 produced far superior images. My guess is that I got a LEMON.
