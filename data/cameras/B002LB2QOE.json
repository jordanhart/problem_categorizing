{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera! Awesome features and easy to use!", "Author": "Chelsea", "ReviewID": "R3HGRSTKP6HJXB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I highly recommend this camera! I've needed a new camera for awhile now and for the past few months, intensely researched all of the new models coming out for the Fall. To begin with, I had my heart set on either the Sony TX1 or the Canon 980IS (both new), but after initial reviews of those cameras, I got nervous and decided to look elsewhere. One day, I saw the commercial for the Samsung TL225 and immediately I was in love! After some research, I knew the TL225 was the camera for me.  I find the camera itself to be lightweight and easy to hold. It's a gorgeous looking camera, with a sleek black casing and a pretty purple stripe on the sides. From my experience so far (I've had the camera about two weeks now) the touch screen works really well. As soon as my finger hits the screen, the camera reacts. I've had issues in the past with shutter lag, but not with this camera! As soon as I hit the button to take a picture, the picture is taken immediately. I'm still getting the hang of all the different features, but one that I absolutely love is the front LCD screen! It's so simple to take a picture of yourself! The zoom is 4.6 and that's plenty for me as a college student who mostly takes travel photos and social pictures of myself and my friends. The \"Smart Auto\" mode is really useful (the camera adjusts on its own to suit the environment you're taking the photo in).This camera is absolutely worth the $320+ I paid for it.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "So much potential, So disappointing...", "Author": "Jeff Helmes", "ReviewID": "R3JJ854N9DIP5A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "With roughly 3.8 gazillion arm's length self portraits posted on Facebook, it's amazing that Samsung is the only manufacturer to put a screen on the FRONT of the camera. Pure genius. They must have a rock-solid patent claim. If you want to eliminate the aiming guesswork and see yourself while taking an \"armie\" (as my GF so eloquently calls it), then the Samsung TL 220 & 225 are presently the only game in town.Samsung takes it a step further by pre-programming cute little animations that you can play on the front screen to grab the attention of children, young and old. This works out quite nicely when trying to get a young child to actually look at the camera. Another stroke of genius.In addition to its unique front screen, Samsung adds the best touch screen this side of an iPhone. The TL 225 steps up with a gorgeously high resolution 3.5\" LCD that dominates the back of the camera. In fact it replaces nearly every button and control you expect to find on a digital camera. The only buttons are (of course) power, shutter, & zoom, plus a button to quickly toggle between shooting & playback--which is a joy with its 1.1 million pixel resolution.Samsung takes a cue from Apple, adding gestures to the touch screen control. For example, to delete a picture you can swipe an \"X\" on the screen (don't worry, it asks you if you are sure before the picture erased.) They even do the iPhone interface one better with haptic feedback, i.e. you feel the virtual \"buttons,\" thanks to a vibration as your finger touches each command. This also works nicely.Thanks to the front screen and awesome touch screen, the camera is sure to become the talk of every party you bring it to. So where does this camera go wrong? Well for one, picture quality leaves a bit to be desired. In spite of 12.2 MP plus optical AND digital image stabilization, WAY WAY too many of the shots come out blurry. It may not be the camera's optics or electronics as much as the ridiculous length of time many photos require to snap. I don't know if its the \"blink detection\", \"smile shot\", or \"face recognition\" but many, if not most, photos seem to take forever to snap. It's so frustrating to tell an increasingly annoyed bunch of people, \"ok, keep smiling, it will just be any second now...any second now...keep smiling...oh for the love of Pete...WTF...SNAP!...ugh...\"But that's not the main reason I was let down by this camera that just seemed absolutely perfect for my favorite shutterbug; its potentially greatest asset can quickly become its Achilles heel. After just 6 months of ownership, I pulled the camera out of my pocket to snap a picture...and was met with a dark screen and a nasty spider crack in the LCD. There was no warning, no incident, no drop, no fall. One minute the camera was taking photos fine, the next minute it was a $300 paper weight.Since the touch screen performs nearly ever function, there's no way to effectively use the camera. There's not even a viewfinder to manually aim the camera. The camera still takes pictures. The touch screen still functions as the haptic feedback still registers. There's not even a perceptible flaw in the exterior glass. The crack appears to be only inside the camera.As I said there was no accident to speak of. The crack occurred while inside my pocket, which has served without fail as the home of iPhones 2G, 3G, 3GS, as well as numerous digicams, calculators, etc. I can only assume the design of the TL225's body is insufficient to safely support its large LCD. Clearly its body too easily flexes beyond the LCD's structural limits.And now I'm saddled with a $300 paperweight until I hear back from Samsung service. They say the repair will be $91 if they determine that abuse negates the warranty. I'm guessing they will pass the buck faster than Toyota. My concern is that I'll still have a poorly designed camera that must always be handled with kid gloves, not to mention the nearly $400 invested for a compact digicam that actually doesn't take pictures any better than a basic $150-200 model.My recommendation is to stick with the companies whose reputation lives and dies with cameras, such as Canon, Olympus, Nikon. Come to think of it maybe they knew better than squeeze two screens, one almost as big as the camera itself, into a compact plastic digicam. The front screen is cool, but not worth the headache of a weak design--or the $100 premium--over a comparable camera.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just Right", "Author": "Preston M.

I will give you a simple breakdown with the PROS and CONS.PROS- Great touch screen- 2nd display screen- Beauty mode for clearer pictures- 12 megapixels- Solid value- Top notch face recognition modeCONS- Only a 5x zoomThe camera does everything it promises to do.  I took a lot of time to research different point and shoot cameras and this one meets just about all my needs.  It comes with a detailed instruction disk that should definitely be read.  The camera has so many features that it is hard to keep track of.  The good thing is that you don't have to remember them all to take great photos.  If you are able to spend some time with it, you will want to know more and test out all the features.  If you want a small feature packed camera at a decent price then this may be the one for you.  The average zoom is my only real complaint but it is not a deal breaker.

I read endless reviews and actually purchased two cameras which I returned.Then arrived this great camera!  I immediately fell in love with it.  The touch screen is amazing, and once I read the manual on the disc, I learned how to use the menus quickly and efficiently.  The camera is very lightweight (good to use the attached lanyard) and it is great looking.  The self-portrait feature is really fun.But, what I like the most about it is the fast response, and the STUNNING quality of the photos it takes.  The smart auto mode really is smart, unlike the other two cameras I tried.  I am still playing with all the different modes, and am anxious to get outside when it stops raining for a moment :) But, inside shots, even in low light, turn out amazingly clear.Everything about this camera just feels \"right\", and I highly recommend it!", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great features, moderate picture quality", "Author": "M.

But since the entire back is touch screen, you can't help but make accidental touches and change some random setting.  I agree with some of the reviews that the picture quality is so-so.  In bright light or flash, it's good.  But medium-light shots that you think would not require flash come out grainy and splotchy.We absolutely love the front LCD.  Our 18 month daughter never wants to pose for a shot because she wants to always see the screen.  Now she's happy looking at the screen in front!  We've also used the timer feature and the countdown on the front screen is great.  The movie quality is good too, maybe better than still photo quality.

She still uses it and it\u00a1\u00a6s been very reliable, but she did drop it a few times.  There are obviously scuff marks, but it appears as though the drops have damaged some of the on-screen touch capability which is a big deal on a camera like this.Before the drops, we had no complaints.  The camera was reliable, turned on quickly, and went directly into shooting mode for a quick picture.  We found it to be great for children because of the front-facing clown animation.I would recommend this camera to anyone who is not clumsy! :)", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera is OK, but it is way over-priced...", "Author": "M. Brown \"Shopaholic\"", "ReviewID": "R2LJBB4E8PSFFT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to get this camera because of the dual view.  While this is a nice feature, it is not worth losing the quality of the picture.  Although you can get everyone's face in the shot, it is rarely centered.  The view screen on the front does not align exactly with the screen on the back, which is actually taking the picture.  So, most times, you get a bunch of extra background on one side (or another, if you over-correct) that you did not intend to be in the picture.  But, it is definitely better than not having the screen at all.  It just could have been aligned better by Samsung.If you have a young child, you may want to reconsider purchasing this camera.  I bought this camera to take pictures of my 19 month old son.  When taking a picture inside with the flash, his eyes are closed/ half closed in almost every picture.  I am very disappointed about this, as this is my main purpose for this camera!  You probably get one really nice picture for every 25-35 that you take.  When you turn the flash off, the picture is terrible.  Since a small child is a moving target, the picture comes out all blurry.  When outside, the pictures turn out fine.  So, it is just not a good camera if you plan on taking pictures of a child.  That being said, it is a decent camera for a teen/ young adult who would only be taking pictures of other teens/ young adults.The only other thing that I am disappointed with is the clarity of the picture.  I went from a 10 MP Canon to this 12 MP Samsung.  I thought that the picture would be better on the Samsung.  But, I don't believe it is.  I have not yet downloaded my pictures from the camera to the computer.  Unless the clarity changes from the camera screen to the computer screen, the pictures on my 10 MP Canon were noticeably better.  It was also much nicer for taking pictures of my son.  It broke, which is why I needed a new one.I do a lot of shopping online, so I know how helpful customer reviews can be to the online shopper trying to find the best item for the best price.  The price from Amazon was not the best.  But, it was the best price for the best service, I believe.  I did find this camera about $30 cheaper at Abe's of Maine.  However, the customer reviews on Abe's of Maine were pretty bad.  Not only do they supposedly call and pester you to buy more things, but some customers said that the shipping time could take up to a month.  I needed this camera for a vacation in Florida.  So, I spent a little extra for the Amazon service.  It was worth it to me to know that the camera would get here on time.  I did not listen to other customers who said a lot of the same things that I am saying.  I thought that the dual view was worth losing a little bit of clarity, which may have been true if I didn't have these issues taking pictures of my son.  It is not a terrible picture, just not as crisp as the pictures from my Canon.All in all, I probably would have loved this camera before I had my son.  Knowing that there are better cameras out there that would better suit my needs, I probably would not purchase this camera again.  Like I said previously, it is a good camera for teens/ young adults.  The only worthwhile reason to purchase this camera it the dual view.  If you want to take pictures of small children or if you want a crisper picture, go for a Canon.  There may be other brands out there that are also good.  But, I can only speak for what I have used.

The design (and purple color!!!) is oh so cute.The love-sickness ended when I went to a concert of my favorite band.The good: The landscape feature let me take decent pics while super zoomed it.The bad: I wish I knew that every time you zoom in/out while filming a vid, the sound blocks out for that period of time. Unfortunately, all of the videos I took, while look really good, sound something like this \"la la la la____la laaa___aaaa__aaa la_la_l_laaa_aa.\"The battery, that was fully charged going in to the concert, began dying after about 3 vids (20ish mins). So another con--low battery live.Others have mentioned that sometimes you have to push the power button and/or playback button a couple of times before it actually turns on. Really annoying. And sometimes the slide show begins for no reason at all when you push the playback button and there's no way to  stop it unless you turn off the cam completely.I wish I could return it, but the stupid thing fell out of my purse and hit the ground.

Admittingly, this is quite an awesome feature. However, I have grown to love Sony Cybershots.  I have previously owned the DSC-T9 and the DSC-W150.  My major complaint about this Samsung is how slow it takes pictures.  More often than not I miss out on things because it's doing something.  So it's hard to take pictures quickly one after each other, unless you have the multi-shot option activated.  My Sony's were always so quick.  The TL225 is a great little camera, and it is a lot of fun.  I think it's great for what it is.  The picture quality is amazing.  The oddball thing is when I received it, it was set to take 9MP instead of it's intended 12MP.  The 9MP came out so fuzzy, as opposed to taking the same picture at 12MP.  Maybe someone else knows the reasoning for this. My only other comment about it is that since it's my first touchscreen camera, I am still getting used to it, even though I've now had it for 5 months.

It's raw and untouched.The one thing that irks me is that the wrist strap that came with the camera is not adjustable, and I haven't been able to find one (in stock) that is.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Myers", "ReviewID": "R1IUI01FWDO3PO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great compact camera.

The pictures are really amazing my wife and I are impressed, I wanted to buy a $500 camera to have really great pics, but I have nothing to regret with this one, people even ask me if I paid a pro to make my pictures.

This  Camera was the right choice for me.  The touch screen monitor on the back is a fun yet functional feature.  There are lots of fun options to choose from, I really like the edit feature you can do face effects right on the camera!  No need for photo shop.  (or not as much anyways)  Fun Fancy camera.  The only thing is that I am afraid of is that if I drop it one time it will be broken, however I just always put the strap on my arm.  The monitor on the front of the camera has entertained all the young children in my family.  I have had so much fun with this camera!!!  I did only give it 4 stars for Picture quality because I have noticed that with the flash in some light the pictures appear to be grainy, however that could just be that I am new with this camera and I might not have it set to the right function.  But the quality of other pictures that I have taken are amazing!

I  suggest you download the users manual and read through it thoroughly as there are tons of features on this camera that you will not figure out on your own. A lot of people were complaining that you cannot effectively take a self portrait without messing up the settings, via touching the touch screen. I have have no issues with this, but it's probably because my previous camera was a touch screen and I am used to taking those types of pics with it.

Reviews are not meant to complain about defective items!!! I have had this Cam since middle September and it is Amazing, works beautifully and have NEVER had a problem with it!!!N-E-Wayz  So I simply do not have to waist my time convincing anyone here why this camera is sooo good or why they should get it, I decided on telling you folk where to look on experts opinions of this Camera.  I already wrote a review for this Cam in the \"TL 225 Orange\" review thread, and also gave a link to a professional review within the comment section, so I will do the same here wit a different review.  Anyone who knows about electronics knows about the site \"CNET\", they are at the top of the Heep when it comes to reviews on electronic products, and are the most pickiest in the industry without question!!!  CNET rated this Cam 4 stars out of 5!!!  That is AMAZING considering I have going to CNET for camera reviews for the past 7 years and have NEVER seen a Point and Shoot Camera rated so high before!!!  To get to there site simply google CNET reviews, the very top link click on it. From there home page you can compare all other point and shoot cameras to this one, and I can tell you right now, there is seriously NO camera out there that will give you your moneys worth then this one!BTW, also check out other reviews of this Cam by the professionals by searching the WEB, it's getting RAVE REVIEWS!!!Paul", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "delicate", "Author": "Lori Dumas \"Lori\"", "ReviewID": "RRUL3E2KD87R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice camera but we didnt have it long when it got dropped once.

Also, takes nice pictures, high tech touchscreen, relatively small size.But problems arose: it was very difficult to turn the front screen on or off - it's supposed to be a tap but worked 20% of the time.  The front screen wasn't a great measure of how the picture would be (different zoom).  After a couple weeks the lens had trouble opening.  There is a \"shake\" feature, where shaking the camera in certain directions would advance pictures, change settings, etc, but ours was very sensitive and would get stuck.  On many occasions we'd be looking at pictures, move a little, and all of the sudden the camera would be quickly advancing through all our pictures.So, we returned it.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "ask about the camera.", "Author": "Gilberth Pacheco \"gilberth pacheco\"", "ReviewID": "RE6MFYC2LNGFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "a ask.. if a buy the camera with the protector and the memory card of 8gb, it comes to me the loader of the battery and the port USB include? please i need the answer the possible after for buy the camera.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stick to Canon, Nikon or even Sony", "Author": "C.

I've had it open twice while shooting.3) When I push the play button (hard to see and press if it's dark or if you're in a hurry), sometimes the photos automatically start scrolling across the screen and can't find a setting for manually scrolling through. Every so often the photos fly by like there's something wrong with the software or hardware, There is a SIGNIFICANT amount of lag time when dragging your finger across the photo to move to the next one. And I mean really slow. It happens randomly.4) Also a significant amount of lag time when shooting, both between photos and when you press the shoot button. I missed a lot of shots waiting for the camera to shoot.5) Camera takes horrid shots when the subjects and background are dark. My old Sony cybershot, which I was replacing with this camera, took better photos.6) The front display, which is one of the reason I bought the camera, keeps turning itself off EVERY time I turn off the camera and have to turn it back on. The front display is useless if it's even mildly dark.7) sometime you have to push the ON button several times to get it to work.pros: It takes pictures and can be recharged through the usb port on your computer.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not a camera to use with kids", "Author": "S.

I researched digital cameras for weeks. When I read that this camera has a special setting to take pictures of moving kids, I was elated. Perfect!! And, it's gotten several great reviews. (Which I now think might have been planted by Samsung.) I went to a large retailer (not Amazon) that has Geeky people that can assist you, and purchased the camera online on 10/31. I even bought the extended 2 year warranty. And I needed to purchase a mini memory card. I spent over $400 for the whole process.For 6 weeks I've tried to fall in love with it...it's not happening.The shutter lag is nothing exceptional.The \"moving kid\" mode is useless. The shutter lag is so slow they won't stay in the frame.The auto flash feature won't work properly.The touch screen is far from intuitive. Lucky for me I have smaller fingers and can manipulate it fairly well. If you have big hands avoid this camera at all cost.Actually, I think anyone should avoid this camera at all cost.Needless to say, the large Geeky retailer refuses to help me. They continue to refer me to their team. I'm quite competent with a digital camera. I don't need instructions. I need a digital camera that works as described.It claims to be all that and a bag of chips. It's not.If you decide to try it out, be swift in your review; and if you don't fall in love with it by Day 2 or Day 3, run (don't walk) and return it.
