Perry", "ReviewID": "R1VIGMRGEHYLUA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to add to my outside cameras and general daytime performance is fine though not much different than the 420TVL.  The added features over the 420TVL, including zoom, focus, more IR LEDs, aren't worth the extra cost to me.  First, zoom is so small a range that it isn't worthwhile.  I have the camera looking at my driveway and there was very little difference in the captured frame with zoom at either end of its range.  Second, focus only is needed if  you change the zoom setting.  Finally the addd IR LEDs may help if the area is totally dark and there isn't anything nearby in frame but I leave the garage lights on and there is a car parked about 15' away.  The car causes a hazy flair in the middle of the display... Unless you are aiming this camera at an empty area in near total darkness at night, stick with the 420TVL.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.95", "Features": "Powered by 1/3 Sony Super HAD CCD technology, color DSP, automatic CDS sensor\n540 TV lines high resolution, 36 IR lights for night vision\nBuild-in 3.5-8mm zoom focus Manual Iris Lens\n1/50~1/12,000 second Electronic Shutter. 0.45 Gamma Correction\nPackage included: CCTV security camera, 12V DC 500mA power supply and security warning decal", "Name": "VideoSecu Day Night 540TVL Outdoor Night Vision CCTV Home Security Camera Weatherproof Vandal proof Built-in 1/3\" Sony CCD with 3.5-8mm Varifocal Lens 36 Infrared LEDs with Camera Power Supply and Security Warning Decal 1ZH", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTdZlaxgL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004265PXK"}}
