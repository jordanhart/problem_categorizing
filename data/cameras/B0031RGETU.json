It is by far one of the best little point and clicks that I have had and I have had at least 5 in the past 5 years. It's built well and has a exceptional battery life (275 picks per charge on average with 14 meg pictures) and the recharge is fairly quick. I added a 16gig memory card for the video recording aspect and I love it. I can record 5 hours and 50 mins of 720p on the thing which is way nicer than the Flip that I was looking at. I used to get an occasional blurry shot with my other cameras from them not focusing well on moving objects (kids) but with this one I haven't had a bad shot yet on the kids running in the yard. It truly is amazing.All in all it's a great little camera for the price.And don't let the other guy scare you off from this camera. He more than likely put the card in before he hooked the camera up to his computer. By the way, make sure you hook the camera up to your computer BEFORE you put your memory card in. But if you screw up and put it in first all you have to do is clear out your pictures, eject the card and then plug it up to the computer for a fresh install.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera!", "Author": "Michael Craig \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZROMT80XAZTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera at best buy in Miami on vacation. I took it to the beach multiple times, went snorkeling for a couple of hours, and use it for everyday shots. The pictures are crystal clear. The 720p HD video looks awesome, especially on your HD tv. No issues with this camera. No problems with hooking it up to the computer. Just plug it in and there it is. Charges fast. Takes a sd card for extra memory. I don't know what happened with these others peoples' cameras. Probably user error. Don't let the 1 star reviews scare you away.All in all, great camera. Battery life was long. Took a ton pix at highest resolution, video, and editing on the camera, and it lasted all day. About the same size as my regular didital camera. Nice features. Best buy has it on sale for 269.

The software is intuitive, the options varied and I took it to the tidepools right away and got some great super macro shots of marine life underwater. Rinsed off the saltwater and took it to the mountains for the long shots. It is small enough for a pocket and great for hiking and backpacking - no worries on dropping etc... Still playing with it and learning all the options but I highly recommend the camera. It does all that it says it does; it is compact and burly. Found the digital zoom fuzzy and worthless but overall a great deal - excellent improvements over the older models and well worth the price.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera!", "Author": "Nichole", "ReviewID": "R3FYYQIS9H9FNB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After punishing this poor little camera all summer, i've gotta say i am deeply impressed with it. The case is now scratched and a bit worn from all the abuse i've put it through, and not only is it still holding up like a champ but it takes astonishing pictures; during my whitewater rafting trip i caught some killer 'mid action' pictures and never had to worry about keeping it dry, and never once had a blurry shot no matter how rocky the ride got.The panorama option is also a phenomenal addition- i have some amazing sunset shots that look seamless thanks to the built in sensor (automatically lines up and takes the next 2 shots for you- all you have to do is move the camera and it does the rest). The zoom really impressed me too, especially underwater (just make sure you set it to the underwater option- i found that makes a big difference).I also love how easy this camera is to use- my dad bought the new Canon underwater camera for our California trip, and he spent the better portion of every killer moment tryin to adjust his settings or figure out which button to push. If you read the manual on it and learn the Canon before hand its a pretty cool camera, but personally when i'm in the heat of the moment for an awesome shot i dont want to be fiddling with buttons and trying to remember how to get to whatever setting i need.I give this camera an A+, and i'm really looking forward to seeing what improvements they make on it in the next couple years.Sincerely,An Avid Action-Photo Junkie :)", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Broken?

At 120$, it was a steal but, less than a week after the 90-day warranty expired, the camera refused to recognize the fully charged battery or any battery. Throughout this period, despite the cameras freezeproof, waterproof, shockproof  `abilities', I coddled this baby. After weeping on the phone to Olympus they said they'd take a look at it and maybe clean the contacts or something. I sent it special UPS (12$-recommended) and after a month of various delays, the service center finally said that they could repair it for 130$. Uh...How `bout just cleaning it? NO. Diagnosing? NO.

Jones \"AJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z4YQUXXCP796", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought a 6020 while on a cruise ship \"it was the best they had\".Pros:Was delighted at the picture quality.. ability to zoom up and still maintain clarity with the image stabilization.While in the formal dining room getting white balance accurate was a challenge with all of the red hues in the room.. buts thats true for my 600.00 sony too.Movies are spectacular, while the screen shows good reproduction, its nothing like once you get it on your computer!Very close shots while moving does cause some pixilation but the only way to solve that is to go from 720 to 1080 full HD and faster shutter speeds.I took this camera down to maybe 15ft \"possibly 20\" with no leakage whatsoever. However the little lock switch is easily moved if careless and the door opens rather easy after that... \"made me nervous!\"Cons:The metal lens protector on the front will move and not bounce back to position if the camera is turned off.This seems to be an issue with the 6020, and I found it to be true on 3 others \"as I took mine back\" and the lower models \"6000 and below\" didn't seem to do that.The way to reproduce the problem is to take a towel or a slightly damp fingertip and gently sweep downward. The metal screen will move and stay in the mid position you leave it rather than bounce back up when released to assume it position to protect the screen.Another issue which I'm not sure is an issue:.. when you zoom up or zoom back.. there is a funny sound emitted on playback.I can't tell if its supposed to be there to indicate you are zooming, but if so.. thats a lame feature that should be removed.I read a review of the 8010 and it had the same issue.Last.... I wasn't able to find a details view of any picture or movie file to see the kb size.I expected a 300.00 camera to not have the lens protector issue. They tried to downplay it.. but I figure if you need a protector, you need it.. if you don't, you don't.And I believe this to be a bug with the 6020 since I didn't see it in the lesser models of they same brand.The time mostly likely to need a lens protector is when the camera is off and not under your full attention, and thats when it malfunctions.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent, full-featured point-and-shoot digicam; minor gripes keep it from five stars...", "Author": "35-year Technology Consumer \"8-tracks to 802.11\"", "ReviewID": "RATGNJAU5F8G4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has many positive attributes that should make it attractive to the casual photographer or videoographer (or even to serious hobbyists who might themselves unable to schlep full size gear).Among its obvious postive features:(1) multiple output options (USB and HDMI)(2) multiple charging options (AC adapter or USB from a computer)(3) excellent still picture quality (up to 14 megapixel resolution)(4) HD video capture(5) image stabilization for both still and video image capture(6) internal memory storage or removable SD/SDHC card(7) waterproof, shockproof, dustproof design (to a point, of course), and works from well below freezing (14 degrees F to 104 degrees F)(8) auto or manual options allowing increased control over many common photography options (including a wide range of lighting conditions, 80-1600 ISO values, flash and macro settings)(9) \"tap control\" of the four-way controller allows you to change menu functions with a flick of your finger (especially useful while wearing gloves)A few nagging gripes keep this from reaching the \"five star\" level.(1) No included user guide. In the box you'll find a quick start guide, but if you want the full user manual, you'll need to download it from Olympus as a .pdf file. This camera is feature dense, the user manual is 80+ pages long, and it should have been included in the box. While the camera has built-in help functions, they simply aren't a substitute for the bound manual that should have been included.(2) Lens placement. The lens for this camera is inexplicably placed in the top left corner (relative the photographer). This is a location you will soon learn to keep your left hand fingers clear of while shooting, Why it wasn't placed in a location where photographers aren't likely to grasp is anybody's guess.(3) Non-intuitive 4-way \"arrow pad\" controller. Most of us have been using these for years now; this one takes some time to figure out. Spend some time with the manual to understand its menus and order of operation before taking any high-value pictures.While all of these were preventable, they don't detract from the overall value of this camera. I purchased this for upcoming travel in a harsh environment likely to test each of its waterproofing, shockproofing and dustproofing.

Coble", "ReviewID": "R2PVSISUD96WAW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After some basic research for a camera to be used solely for vacations to tropical locations, I settled on the Olympus Tough 6020 camera.  I was sold on the features of the camera, particularly the ability  shoot pictures and video under water.  What a mistake.In the month of July 2011, my girl friend and I took a cruise to the Caribbean and on the second island stop of our cruise my camera died. I sadly discovered later that water had collected in the camera.  My girlfriend and I had booked an excursion to swim with sting rays that day and unfortunately I was unable to capture some of the most significant portions of that event to my camera failure.  Consequently, I was forced to purchase over the counter instant cameras to chronicle the remainder or our trip which consisted of 3 days.  Not only did I lose a few pictures that were shot on the cameras hard drive (luckily I shoot the majority of the trip on memory flash card), but I lost my ability to video the last three days of our vacations.Since returning home, I have returned my camera and in fairness Olympus fixed and returned it within two weeks. Nonetheless, after further investigation it is obvious I am not the only one who has purchased this camera and has had similar outcomes.  I, like the other reviews I have read, made sure that my camera was locked and that I did not go below the water levels indicated in the manual (never went lower than 6 feet of water).  Consequently, it is clear to me that this camera does not support what it advertises.  My suggestion to Olympus is fix the seal problems for this camera or stop advertising that it can take pictures under water.  My vacation was altered by the fact that the camera didn't do what it said it could do and I will never be able to capture some of the memories I lost due to a defective product. As it stands now, Olympus has lost my patronage for any of their products in the future.

Has a solid feel to it - I didnt test the 'ruggedness' fully yet, but I generally carry it without a case, throw it in my pocket or a bag and dont worry about it. Picture quality is ok, focusing is very good most pictures are not blurry. The only weird issue I had is with the lighting, it can't seem to figure out the proper adjustment. Like a lot of cameras, takes great pictures outside in good lighting, but sometimes the flash will fire in a bright setting - not a huge deal if the picture comes out good, but could drain the battery. The bigger issue is in variable lighting sometimes it comes out too dark, it can't seem to figure out the lighting properly. One sunny day I took a picture into a shaded area which was also fairly bright and the picture came out extremely dark, it looked like it was night.As it is I'm keeping it anyway, got it for $135 on Ebay and I think its worth that price, wish a firmware update could fix the lighting though.Added: I finally used this in a pool, it works great. Pictures in the pool were great and the camera went underwater many times with no problems, very waterproof.

It was great to have a waterproof camera to take through rainforests, waterfalls, kayaking, snorkeling, swimming with turtles, etc. The picture is pretty good (see other more technical reviews for picture quality). Its not like even a low end DSLR, but for its use its likely good enough.I was especialy interested in taking the camera snorkeling on the coral reefs there. It goes down 30ft, which is plenty for snorkeling: the furthest I could comfortable descend is about ~20ft. However, once you get down that far, there are a couple of issues I didn't realize until after my first batch of botched pictres:1. The much lower light level means things have to be *still*. I'm not sure why I thought this camera would magically overcome the shutterspeed/focus distance rule of thumb...2. In coastal regions, any non-clear water will almost ruin any pictures used with flash.3. Zooming dosn't really help for the above reasons.So, take your habits with normal photography and double them if you plan on taking this camera below the surface: stay still, don't zoom in low light, and use the flash sparingly, especially in coastal/cloudy water.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excited for the camera, disappointed when I got it.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3QEVJGDPAB29P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I got the camera in the mail I took it with me on a fishing trip.

Some are decent and some are just trash.  The real problem is the 'water proof' part.  Have used the camera on several vacations for snorkeling.  Three out of four times I ended up with water inside the camera.  Turns out that even if you do everything correct, Olympus still requires you to send the camera to them every year to replace the water proof seals.  For a nominal charge of $ 29 (plus your freight) each and every year you want the camera to work as a water proof camera.If you are shooting in wet settings and not submerged I think you will be okay.  But if you plan on submerging the camera plan on getting the camera serviced every year.For myself I will be looking at a different company to purchase my next snorkeling camera.Additional note:  Brand new the camera experienced water invasion on first use.  Was covered under warranty.  Several months later on second use the camera again experienced water invasion that was covered under warranty.  The following year when the exact same thing happened outside of warranty it was considered lack of maintenance on the seals and not covered.

It was for me, because I already have other cameras for other purposes. But I wouldn't purchase this one as my sole or main camera.

It's made to be a durable camera. I havn't actually dunked it yet, but it got splashed on and had a dime size peice of hail hit it right on the shutter and no problem. So no complaints there. The feel of this camera doesn't leave you afraid to carry it either.

While hiking I mostly carried it in my cargo pants pocket or shirt pocket. Sat on it a few times too which goes back to the durability.4) Cost. At about 200 bucks tops, this is a great camera. The last point and shoot I owned was a Cannon and cost about 400. So considering this one takes equal quality pictures and has the added durability, it's a no brainer.No for the Cons:1) The charger! you have to leave the battery in the camera to charge it. A fact that I did not realize before taking on my trip. I had left the cord at home to save space packing thinking that the little box that plugs into the wall was a stand alone charger like all my other cameras have been. Fortunately, I found a universal charger made by Logitec that worked. This is my main gripe because it just really irritates me that I can't have a spare battery that I can just change back and forth with while the other is charging.2) the pictures tend to be rather dark. Don't get me wrong, the quality is great, just the brightness needs to be up a notch or two.3) had some problems with the auto panoramic mode when the battery get's low. kinda weird that the battery power would have an effect on function of the software, but all I know is that when the battery was low it wouldn't work right, on full charge, it works great. Go figure?Overall a winning camera for the cost. The picture quality is good for a point and shoot. Many of the reviews will say they suck, but as the husband of a graphic design artist, I'd say they are on par with others in the SAME CLASS. So as long as your expectations are in line with a point and shoot then you should be happy with this camera.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good little tough camera!", "Author": "OutdoorThorman", "ReviewID": "R27A3ZMAI8BRML", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This little camera was bought as a replacement to our old waterproof camera that we left at the top of a mountain (Olympus Stylus 850 SW). With much research and review reading, we decided to get this camera. Over the past month it has performed just as good, if not better than our old one. The few problems I have run into are: Won't center focus to take a picture and flashes a red box instead of green, warning that if you take the picture it won't be in focus. I have run into this twice, but I just turned the camera off then back on and the picture took just fine of the exact same subject I was originally trying to focus on. #2 thing I don't like, functionality-wise, is that when you take a picture and the review of the image pops up, you can't delete it at that same time. You have to go into playback mode then delete the picture, then go back into shooting mode. I miss being able to quick delete a picture. #3. Coloration isn't very brilliant. Post-editing required. That's about it. This camera has prooved waterproof in the ocean, freezeproof on a glacier-filled mountain, just wish it was sand/dustproof for the beach. I would recommend this camera to any of my friends who want a durable, small, outdoorsy camera.PS:  This float strap works great if you are afraid of dropping the waterproof camera but it sinking.

Foster", "ReviewID": "RCC7E2T7X6H7X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was considering purchasing this camera for personal use but was turned off by the reviews.  However, I needed a waterproof camera for work, and this ended up being the only one available immediately in town.  I am glad it was.  I use this camera primarily for taking close-ups (think inches) away in either bright sunlight or very dim and shadowed areas.  It even has a LED that can be turned on to light up very close pictures.  It doesn't overshadow those close-ups like a flash can.  In fact, there's the general close-up mode, the super close-up mode, and then the ultra close-up mode with the LED.  The general close-up mode will use a flash, and I've found it works fine to leave it on when taking regular pictures as well.  The super close-up does not allow you to use a flash, but it can take closer pictures.  The LED is amazing.  These modes would be great for engagement rings, baby feet and fingers, and pretty much everything.  You only have to be a few inches away for it to focus.There are many different options with this camera.  I've found that I stay most often in the program mode.  I will agree with other uses that sometimes the pictures appear washed out or too dark, in which case, you can adjust the amount of light you want in.  It is very easy and has worked every time for me.  There is a beauty mode, several underwater mode, pets mode, etc.  I like the artistic modes too, although I have not had much excuse to use them at work.I also use it in dark areas (think dusk to twilight) to focus on objects 20 feet away.  The camera is the slowest when taking multiple pictures in a row with the flash.  The flash does take some time to recharge, but I don't think this is a big issue.  I don't want to have anyone moving so fast inside my house that I can't wait for the flash to recharge.  Outside, you can turn the flash off, and the camera still takes clear pictures.I rated the durability at a 4 because after reading the review from the gentleman who left the camera on his golf cart, I was careful not to expose the screen to any sharp objects, but the screen was still scratched within the first week.  This camera definitely needs a carrying case or maybe buy one of those cling-on screen covers used for cell phones.  An as yet unfounded fear is that buttons and seals do not look particularly waterproof.  I have not taken it underwater though, and I have no plans to.I've tested the shock absorbing capabilities as it falls out of my pocket while sitting down onto tile floor below.  No damage noted.In short, a great little camera.  I think you'll be the most satisfied with it if you know some basic concepts of photography (such as providing adequate and appropriate lighting), but this is a solid little camera.  All I have to do now is wait for my little Cannon Powershot to kick the bucket....", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Most Awesome Thing Ever", "Author": "Corey Quin \"rndmbuyer\"", "ReviewID": "R27UMONONENZW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok so I did some shopping around before I decided on this camera because my old camera broke.  Though this camera was more expensive than some of the other camera's I looked at, I chose this one for a couple of reason's over the others:1.  It is water and impact resistant2.  It is small enough to carry around without being a hinderance3.  Picture quality is awesome4.  This is the first version of the tough series to use SD memory cards (a big factor in my choosing process)Anyway I really needed this camera because I was going on vacation and we were visiting Florida and some of the theme parks there.  I am always one to enjoy quality technology and I feel I made the right decision with this camera, because:1.  The features and different picture options make taking good/creative pictures easy and fun2.  When we visited a water park, on one of the slides, it flew out of my pocket.  And true the the stylus tough series it  survived and takes pictures just as well.3.  Well since I was at a water park it got wetNow as with any piece of technology there are some drawbacks:1.  It does not have the zoom capabilities as some other cameras2.  The battery life of the camera isn't as long as I would like (last about 3/4 of a day for me)The zoom capabilities I can do without because I use the camera for more social events, like going out to the beach or going to Disneyland.  I really don't need to take pictures of something 1000's (I know exaggeration) of feet away.

I liked the durability the description offered and I have been pleased with Olympus cameras in the past but I was not blindly \"set\" on this camera so I read many of the reviews here.  I noted a disproportionate amount of 5 stars or 1 star.  Those who rated 5 stars pointed to the 1 star reviewers and said they were not paying attention to the actual features,or 'learning' how to use it properly.Now that I have it, I agree 100%.  The 1 star reviews noted a delay in start-up,excessive shutter lag, and the inability to take photos in rapid succession.  Well, as the others have said, those people just didn't read the manual,'play' with the menu,or otherwise 'just try'.  I understand that some people think everything should be plug and play, but if you really want something that has all of the 'bells and whistles' you are going to have to put some time into it. Within 10 minutes of just 'playing around' I found how to change turn off the immediate preview, and change the shutter speed from normal to 'sequential' to 'HI sequential'.  (If turning in a circle and taking 10, perfectly focused photos in 3 seconds is too slow, then yes, this is the wrong camera.)It has in-camera editing, including cropping,changing from color to B&W; or Sepia, creating a calendar, clearing skin and the other options that my previous Olympus had like Macro,Portrait, Motion, Candle-light, etc.There is also an 'in-camera' manual that you can access simply by pressing the ? button, which offers helpful tips with step-by-step.The photos are great and the HD video is even better, very crisp and clear.It's pretty sturdy, and thicker than the last one I had but it is still very light.  I have not yet tested the waterproofing yet, nor dropped it on purpose because I would rather not scratch it.The only aspects that I didn't like were that this model uses an SD card instead of the xD card that Olympus cameras typically use,(Now I have to buy a new card!)and the fact the you can't remove the battery to charge it. The battery does remove but to charge, you open the side and plug in the mini-USB provided, that uses an outlet or a PC.  Leaving this side flap open during charging makes me concerned about damage/dust/etc, however, it does charge pretty quickly so I guess I can live with that.Best Buy retails this same model for $299, but this was on 'sale' for $223, so it was more than I expected and $80 cheaper.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "This thing's a beast.", "Author": "Evan", "ReviewID": "R2P0QUPTN7KY44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On my first hike after I bought this camera, I ended up having to hack some foot-holds in a steep snowfield that covered the trail. As I bent double, chopping steps with my little hand shovel, the camera slipped from my breast pocket. I watched with horror as it slid down the snow and sailed triumphantly off of the cornice into 6 feet of open air. When I had scrambled down to recover it, I found it lying on the hard talus below--utterly unperturbed by its short excursion.Unfortunately, some weeks later I had attached it via the included wrist strap to my kayak. A bone-headed move; the strap is obviously not meant to do more than dangle the camera from your wrist. By the time I recovered my capsized kayak some miles down the river, the leash had snapped and left the camera lying somewhere at the bottom of the river--just fine, I have no doubt, but not in a place I could recover it.Stunningly, Olympus replaced it with a refurbished unit! I swapped out the included strap in favor of some 550lb. test paracord, and since then it's accompanied me on all my adventures, taking stunning underwater video as I snorkeled through Iceland's continental rift lake and panoramas on massive glaciers in the far north of Swedish Lappland.If I have one complaint, it's that the cable has a proprietary connector, so mini-usb won't work.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Useful \"wolfy\"", "ReviewID": "R29SMJT69J3JTQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pro's:  Waterproof, tough, and compact,Con's:  Software is only PC compatible, no disc with camera, and pictures are so-so.I would recommend this camera for an outdoors man, not for a camera buff.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Died after 5 months but great photos", "Author": "D.

Bad: slow to turn on, slow between taking pics, so-so photo quality in low light.---Old review from 26 Aug, 2010---1 star. I have to update this review and rescind my Buy recommendation.  The camera died after five months of use.  I'm not sure why.  The screen says \"No Connection\" when I try to turn it on.  The battery is fully charged and I can still use it to check the time when the camera's off.  I can also connect it to the computer and browse the camera's internal memory.  However, it won't turn on all the way--the shutter won't open and the screen says \"No Connection\".  I contacted Olympus support and they told me to send it in for repair.Also, I still stand by saying that the camera takes great photos and video above and under water.  However, there's quite a lag between taking each shot.  And it takes more time than other cameras to start up.  This means that if you want to quickly turn on your camera to catch that one shot or perhaps catch multiples of the same shot, you have to wait a bit.

I was really looking forward to finally getting one...but it seems the newest \"tough\" version let the software geeks go a little nuts, while giving the durability the minimum attention.  If you are looking for a simple to use, tough camera that produces excellent photos, you will likely be frustrated with this camera. Its toughness appears to still be there, although I have not tested it to its limitations; only dropped from 1 foot or so and only took it to approx. 15' of depth.  I actually don't feel comfortable taking it to its underwater limitations. Have a dedicated underwater camera, the first thing I noted on this camera was the frail lid sealing mechanism which seals the water out of the battery, memory card and charging port. It closes so lightly that I don't believe the O-ring, which is already extremely thin to begin with, is put under much compression at all.  The next thing of concern is the lens protector which opens when you turn the camera on, and closes automatically when you turn it off. This unnecessary little feature appears flimsy and does not inspire much confidence.  If a lens protector is really necessary, they would be better off just recessing the lens more, or having a manual sliding cover. I expect it will be the first thing to break....only time will tell.  The REAL problem with this camera is the programing. It seems the slightest change in lighting conditions just throw this thing out of whack. Where a simple point and shoot camera would just show you exactly what you see...this camera will give you something totally unacceptable. Extreme over-exposures and under exposers seem to be the norm. Sudden movements, such as action shots or any spontaneous moving will show up as just a blur as well. It is possible that I just don't have its settings dialed in, but in my opinion I shouldn't have to do that to begin with.  So it appears that they have \"over engineered\" it from a photographers standpoint, and under engineered it from a robust simple toughness standpoint....NOT what I was looking for.

It starts with \"plug the camera into a computer AND load the software\"  What software?  There is none! Its the firmware in the camera and it is already there.  (I checked with Olympus) AND no computer is required.Icons and settings?  OMG.  More than you can shake a tripod at.  There are three options for the push to shoot button.  There is one photo per click.  And more than one photo per click.  And third, \"Faster\" than more than one per click.  The third setting is hold the button down and it will continous shoot photos.  Yea, right.  I have a 14GB-Class-10 memory card installed. Class-10 is the fastest card there is.  You can't tell the difference in speed of the photos being taken.  Slow, very slow.What is the real difference between; \"Automatically optimizes the camera's settings based on the shooting situation\"  and  \"The camera is set automatically based on the scene.\"  There are 11 scene modes and 21 sub-scene modes.

Luckily, this hunt was during a sale or I might not have been so lucky. The main purpose for my camera is to take quick pictures (friends, pets, random places I go). I am not going to be going on an amazing vacation and need amazing, stellar pictures that sell them self.Come to find out, I am pleased. Maybe that is because prior to this, for the last 6 months, I have only had my Blackberry (2.0 megapixels) camera. The quality is really good but does take a considerable amount of time to get used to the menu settings (I still don't think I am). I have played around with it a bit and have realized the difference between some of the most common settings. I am thankful for the pet feature (though I use sport more often for this as I have a kitten) and firework setting.Also, night shooting seems to be sub par... so just do not plan to use it for that.Word to the wise, get multiple batteries. It tends to drain quickly unless you compromise quality. Particularly if you are going somewhere all day (like we went to Disneyland and took 4 batteries for an all day venture). It does not charge in my computer and must be charged in a wall. But a spare wall charger while you are at it if you want as well.All in all, the quality is great for what I need it to be.

Exterior material selection felt cheap and plasticy.3.) No physical manual.  Only a PDF manual that the camera downloads onto your computer the first time you plug it in.4.) User interface is horrible. Navigating through the menus to change settings, is not intuitive and not organized.5.) Picture quality is poor when you down select anything less than 14MP.6.) No advanced picture taking settings like \"available light\" , \"candle light\" , \"behind glass\" & \"night portrait.\"  All settings that my old 720SW had and which I used a lot.7.) Start up speed horribly slow, losing the kodak moments.  I read on some reviews that you could change this.  But the lack of intuitive or organized menu, I had no idea on how to get to the screen to change it.  Did I mention that there is no physical manual?Hates:8.) IT WOULD LOCK UP after taking pictures occasionally.  You would take a picture, the flash would go off, but the screen would sit in the \"thinking\" position.  The only way to get it to work again, was to pull the battery out, put it back in and turn it on again. Utterly unacceptable.9.) IT WOULD SHUT OFF without reason while I was setting up a posed picture.  Battery charged, no buttons pressed, just sitting there, lining the kids up or whatever, and 'beep' the camera shut off.

I hadn't realized Olympus recommends changing the protective seal every year, so maybe that was the cause.  I was very happy with my old camera, so decided to replace it with the current mode.  The Olympus 6020 seemed to fit the bill and came with a few new features.  I was excited to try it.I received my package in 2 days (love Amazon Prime!) but I have to be honest, I immediately wanted to return it.  I haven't yet, as I decided to see if it will grow on me.  To be fair, I am using my old Olympus as a baseline, so others may not have the same expectations.Pros1.  Uses a standard SD card.  The old version used a smaller version which meant I couldn't swap them out with other cameras (yes, we own several different digital cameras.)2.  I like the black body - very sleek.Cons1. To charge the battery, you leave the battery in the camera, open the slot where the batter/SD card are, and put the attach the charger to there.  This may sound silly, but I prefer a standalone charger.  Now I just have an extra cord I have to remember which divide it belongs to.  The old camera had a separate charger where I could put the batter in.  I just liked that set up better.  I still have the old charger, so I was hoping it would work, but the battery is different, so no luck.2.  Not Mac compatible.  I did some research and read it was Mac compatible, but not true.  Only compatible to download the manual (see # 3 below).  It is not compatible with the Mac software and users have reported issues in transferring pictures to a Mac.  I have done some research and understand there is other Olympus software that may work.  I will try that and report back.3. No manual with the camera.  Seriously.  Who doesn't provide a manual?  Well, technically they do, but it is inside the camera. So, you have to connect your camera to a PC and then read your manual online.  I don't generally read the manual cover to cover, but I do keep them in my camera case so when something crops up (on vacation, for example), I can check the manual and adjust.  Well, I won't be able to do that unless I am also toting around my laptop.  So, I guess I better read and memorize that manual, huh?I haven't actually taken any pictures with it yet.  We are going on a beach vacation in 10 days and I am still deciding whether to keep this or exchange it for something else.  Problem is, I can't find much else I like out there.  I don't understand why Olympus messed with a good product.  My old 770SW was great.  Maybe I should check for one still on the market.If I decide to keep the camera (which I probably will) I will report back on how it actually works.  I did invest in the highest grade memory card recommended by Olympus so that should help with speed.  The one flaw of the old Olympus was it was S-L-O-W!!!!So, all in all, this is an okay camera.

With some trepidation I depressed the tiny on/off button and, LO and BEHOLD a little tune played and a block letter OLYMPUS appeared on the screen.  Nothing more.  In frustration I poked buttons as indicated, menu etc and finally there was a whirring sound and the letter P as promised, appeared right of center and slid over to the top of a list...possibly the current settings?  A few second more and that \"clinking\" sound of the lens guard closing told me nothing more was going to happen.  A half dozen more tries produced the same result.  No lens capture, no images, no messages.  Dead.  A lemon?  An unchecked refurb from Beach and Amazon?  Dunno, but nobody seems to be answering at Olympus ...well, once, but the call quality was so poor, THEY hung up.  Maybe...just maybe, the great camera I've longed for for so long is ...just waiting for customer support, or repair or replacement...but, the documents warn...NO International Warranty is available.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Oly", "Author": "Marc", "ReviewID": "R1HNALRIGF9YLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had trouble with the first camera I received but was taken care of right away.
