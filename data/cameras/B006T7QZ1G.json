Gallagher \"NPG\"", "ReviewID": "R72DAG7Q894MI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been a photographer for over 30 years and have had many different types of cameras.  I bought this camera to take with me on an upcoming overseas trip where I didn't want to carry my Nikon DSLR.  I photographed with the F770EXR in several different settings to test its picture taking capabilities.  I will update this review when I return from my trip.This seems like a very well built camera.  I like the feel and the size is perfect to fit in my pocket.  So far the pictures have been very good.  They do not compare to my Nikon DSLR, but I didn't expect them to.  Outdoor pictures come close.  Indoor pictures with the flash are acceptable.  Indoor pictures without the flash are also acceptable as long as your subject isn't moving and there is adequate light.  I haven't tried night photography yet.The one thing I was disappointed with is the included software; MyFinePix Studio.  I have an Apple Mac and the software isn't compatible with OS 10.  Snow Leopard is the last version this software will work with.  Go to this site to see all of the features you will either get if you use a PC or not have if you use a Mac computer:  [...]The bottom line is I am pleased with the picture taking capability of the F770EXR.  If you want DSLR results then it is best to purchase a DSLR.  If you need a small travel camera to take pictures, I think you will be pleased with this camera.4-17 update.  OK after reading the other reviews especially the ones that gave the camera one star I took my camera out and checked the focus at full zoom.  The camera focused right away and the pictures were clear.  Maybe there were a couple of duds in the first batch released.  I am pleased with mine so far.7-13 update.  Took the camera to Israel and it did great for photos.  The movie camera has a lot to be desired.  It doesn't focus very well and when you zoom in and out it makes a noise that can be heard on your video.  Don't buy this if you are using it for the video feature.  If you just need a camera for photos then I would recommend it.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Socalh2oskier \"Socalh2oskier\"", "ReviewID": "R1XP9G6LLCX97H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am baffled by the mediocre reviews of others on this site regarding this camera.  I've had mine almost two weeks now, shot hundreds of test shots, and I love the camera.  I am not a photo aficianado, so perhaps I don't notice little things that others might, but as a regular joe type consumer, this camera does everything I need and more.  The auto-focus is incredibly fast and accurate.  Photos are crisp and clear.  Color is excellent.  The flash mechanism is a bit weird, but it works fine--I could see how after thousands of uses, the design might be prone to glitches.  A built-in flash with no moving parts would probably be better.  Battery life has been terrific.  I have gone over 300 photos with lots of juice left, and this includes viewing the shots briefly in playback mode.  Like most newer cameras, the battery can only be charged outside the camera.  I would prefer otherwise.  The EXR function works great.  It does a good job of selecting the correct paramaters to give a really good photo on a shot that an amateur like me would likely otherwise mess up.  I also have the F550exr, and, although the F770 improves on the low-light performance of the F550, in extreme low-light situations it still is not very good.  My Casio ZR 100 is much better in extreme low-light situations, but in regular indoor shots, the F770 does fine, in fact, I would say, it is superb.  The zoom is amazing.  Focus is great every step of the way.  Even more amazing is the auto-shake function that stabilizes the photo when using the zoom at or near its limit.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.I have not yet used the video, so I cannot comment on its video capabilities.  I note that, with the F550, video was very good, but that camera sometimes searched for focus if you used the zoom while shooting a video.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you think this camera is bad, then it was damaged in shipping or you don't know how to use it!....", "Author": "ChristianAndCool \"Christian\"", "ReviewID": "R3JLTDH36KKJWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cannot believe that anyone who knows the basics on how to use a camera and did not receive a damaged product can say this camera is bad! This little camera is incredible, with some minor flaws! I recently reduced my rating to 4.5 starts (from 5) due to the video focus problem with the camera.After researching digital cameras for over 2 and 1/2 months and suffering with 2 horrific cameras I had to send back, I finally got the right camera. My first attempt was the highly disappointing Panasonic Lumix ZS20 14.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom (Black) (see my Amaz review for that - it was terrible) as my 1st choice to replace my 7-year-old Kodak EasyShare Z760, and then after that one was a bust, I tried the almost-as-disappointing Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with 16x Optical Zoom G Lens, 3D Sweep Panorama and Full HD 1080/60p Video(see my Amaz review on that if curious), I FINALLY found a camera that takes INCREDIBLE pictures.The Fujifilm FinePix F770EXR 16 MP Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom (Black) is a home run and will definitely stay in my family for the next 5 years for sure, just as the Kodak stayed with me and my family for almost 7 years.This Fuji F770 EXR camera has been a joy to play with on my first day of use. After the battery charged for first time (took about 2.5h), I started taking random pics all around the house and some outside of the window.  The menus are a bit quirky at first, but I quickly got used to them very quickly and the camera itself is very easy to use, even for someone with mid-tech skills (I am advanced on technology knowledge, and this was so simple that I expect someone with basic understanding of tech to figure this out fast).After a whole day playing with the camera, I can say this one is staying and won't be going back! I will continue to update this review as the days go by, but here are first impressions.Top 10 Positives:1) Sexy camera! Batman got nothing on this camera.... I wonder if Batman has one of these strapped to his belt..? :)2) Pictures are SHARP AND CLEAR, if you are using the right mode for the scene! I cannot stress the importance of this enough after the Sony HX9V's horrible coloring of my orange cat and over-washed pics and the Panasonic Lumix ZS20's almost 100% blurry picture rate!3) Tons of fun \"scene\" modes to use. Unlike many other newer cameras, the flash IS indeed an option in almost all of these. This means I can customize (ex: \"cat mode\" with flash produces very nice, fast action pics... \"sports mode\" withI have to admit, I LOVE choosing my own settings, and that is fun for me, just as I used to on my Kodak Z760. But the EXR mode does an incredible job as well for sharp and clean pics, and no need to change anything. :)4) Flash pops, but it moves forward, which creates space to hold camera with left index finger, which is a huge help to keep camera steady (see negative comment on this as well).5) The LCD screen is sharp and crisp!6) It is easy and fast to scroll through pics and delete bad ones. It is also easy and fun to zoom and see every detail (the 16MP sensor is unreal and very good!).7) Battery life is nice in long. I took well over 150 pics, most with flash and still had tons of juice left. I bought second battery in case I am on the road.8) 20x zoom in a tiny camera! It is a huge zoom and pics zoomed at 20x (*no \"digital zoom\" used, this is all lens and focus) came out 95% clear.9) Camera comes with a very very cool GPS system (not tested yet, but seems very good, like a homing beacon. Someone call Batman :).10) Fast moving zoom (despite some motor noise, but minor); fast camera time from off to on and ready to shoot. Fast LCD turn own screen.Top Negatives (mostly \"quirks\", really):1) If I must complain about something, it would be the manual activation of the pop-up flash (you have to hit a button to make flash pop-up once before each use and once it is up, take as many pics as you want with flash just fine). The flash is regulated by camera's sensor, the only thing you \"activate\" is make it \"pop-up\" once before use. That is it.Although some may view this as a negative, I actually think that it is a positive, as the automatic pop-up flashes can really be disruptive if you hold the camera as most do (with your left index finger right on the top-left of the camera for stability). After using the camera for a few hours today, I now push the flash button up as soon as I turn on the camera and since flash pops FORWARD, I can then use that space behind the flash to have my index finger in and hold camera steadier.2) Flash does not come up on its own. But I can assure you, after one day taking pics around, I already got used to turning camera on and popping the flash at same time, so I can rest index finer on flash slot. :)3) The \"rotator\" sensor (when you take landscape or portrait pics - \"up or down\" style pics) does not rotate the date, which is kinda silly. So I can have a portrait pic (\"standing up/vertical) with date sideways instead of bottom of the pic. Not a \"problem\" per se, but it is annoying. Rotation on camera can be kind of \"iffy\" at times in detecting correct position of image; I can handle that using camera's rotate feature or do it in my PC, but doing it on PC lowers pic quality.4) Battery cannot be charged inside camera. The charger is very thin and fast to go from drained to full, but this means I need a 2nd battery for travel, just to be sure.5) May take a day for those with low tech skills to learn, especially if wanting to use all the awesome features, like the Scene modes (\"SP\" on the little selector wheel) or the different \"shortcut\" buttons, like the \"F\" button or the \"FN\" button (not needed, but cool to use - I use these to change pic sizes fast, so I can take 1MB pics for quick uploads vs 4mp pics for printing, etc).6) The video feature lowered my previous 5 star rating to a 4.5 star rating. Why? Because when you zoom in or out, the camera loses focus and the image `blur' for a second or two. Not major to me, as I am a photo-taker, but you should know about this quirk. Videos look clear most of the time and sound was good as well.I will upload some of my pics from today so you can get an idea of the camera's potential. Keep in mind that I have not yet been able to test the \"scene\" modes on landscape (I will take some mountain shots tomorrow) or the \"soft skin\" mode, which I want to use on my wife and see what she looks like with it. I hope it is not a \"painting\" like the Sony, man that was horrible. My cat looks cool, and I have some other \"test pics\" uploaded on the camera's page for your review.So far as about 6h playing with the camera, and using flash like crazy (no GPS), the battery is still showing as \"full\" and the pics have been incredible, so far! I will keep updating this review, but as of right now, this camera is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and that is not saying enough after almost 3 months of research and playing with cameras at BestBuy and Target and suffering with 2 other horrible cameras.Quick tips if you want to try and \"scene\" modes:Best indoor/low light mode (some light, indoors): PartyBest pet (fast moving): sports (with flash).Best steady pet mode: cat or dog, depending (it will focus on pet's face).Best portrait mode (indoors): soft skinBest all purpose/easy mode: turn wheel to EXR.UPDATE: As of 11/3/2012, the Fuji FinePix F770EXR is an 9 out of 10 on my scale with 10 being camera best ever (or 4.5 out of 5). GET THIS CAMERA if you love \"scene\" mode pictures, fast \"auto mode\" EXR's crispy and beautiful pictures or just want a fun, small, light, and cool \"pocket camera\". This is not a professional camera, but for the $270 and for what you get, this is a home run all day long.Update #2: As of 11/7/2012: Tons of pics taken, including through glass of landscape (mountains miles at distance, full zoom - see attached pics). All pics continue to come out sharp and crisp, with very nice tones. Backlight mode works perfect (sunset scene/mode used - see cat pic on sunny window). I have taken at least 100 pics so far, have uploaded them twice to my PC (using camera) and I still have 2/3 of the battery power. I am still on my first charge from out of the box and the battery is fine. More pic samples coming. Another downside to the camera added, thus rating is 9.0 out of 10 (with 10 being the best ever). Still an awesome camera. :)More info and updates to come on this little gem of a camera. :)Christian", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "FUJI F-EXR cameras are the GREATEST!", "Author": "B.Dub", "ReviewID": "R22CCD2PHXZPIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FUJI \"exr\" cameras are my favorite. Over the past 6 years, I have owned \"30\" P-n-S $300-500 cameras. (canon, nikon, casio, panasonic, sony, fuji & olympus). So I can speak with some authority, when I say FUJI F-EXR cameras do the best job. Besides this F770exr, I have owned Fuji's F200exr and F600exr. After taking over 12,000 shots with all my cameras, I have never gotten better images than with a FUJI F___EXR camera! Made possible by their super-fast AF and shutter speed and FUJI's large EXR image processor.  NOTHING beats FUJI in low-light situations, or with ACTION shots \"WHEN using this camera in EXR modes\". NOTHING!  When not in EXR mode, its still a great camera but not as impressive (in my opinion). Action shots and Depth of Field are amazing! AND with it's 25-500mm zoom, you can get ANY shot. SEE my images of the telephone pole I submitted. Even the digital zoom shot at 1,000mm is clear and sharp (using a tripod). FYI - these shots were taken mid-day, pointing West. Using EXR-Auto mode. One at 500mm, one at 1000mm. Fuji's Auto Mode chose: 1/500 sec, f/5.2, ISO-100. In the 25mm shot, FUJI chose: 1/340 sec, f/7.1, ISO-100. Distance from telephone pole was 400-feet (5 houses & 1 street from where I was). Color is Natural, not over-exposed; Edges are clear, but not too sharp, and I love that it can get good subject texture/surfaces. I'm NO photographer! I just like researching cameras. THESE F-EXR cameras CAN give me everything I want WITHOUT the bulk and weight of mid-size cameras.  Later I will submit some low-light and macro photos.

It is unbelievably self sufficient, but obedient when it comes to custom settings necessary in some situations. The built in flash which I seldom need to use seems to know just the right amount of illumination to keep the photo looking natural--not harsh and not flat. I am very pleased with the bracketing options. I bracketmostly for a set of exposures usually an f-stop over and under normal so I have a choice to work with in Photoshop. At times I shoot both JPEG and RAW. Special \"Likes\" that encouraged me to purchase this camera are the positive reviews and comparisons with other \"similar\" cameras and many SLRs. I feel that the resulting images compete well with the images that are produced by my Canon 5D, which I have a lot of respect for. I purchased first the Finepix F550XR which I feel is a great camera as a back-up, and at times primary camera during travel, it produces great images and I have blown some of them up to about 15\" x 18\" nearly filling a 17\" X 22\" sheet of paper, and I think the image could go larger with little or no loss of detail and sharpness. I print on an Epson Stylus PRO 3800 and UltraChrome K3ink and I am awed by the results. Some time later I purchased the Fujifilm FinePix F770EXR for its longer 20X Optical Zoom, and, of course the 16 MP. When traveling in countries like Peru, Cam Pu Chia, Viet Nam, and Thailand I often utilize the GPS capabilities as a reminder of where the images were captured.

That is not a criticism of Fuj as much as for any small camera with a ultra long reach. I can't hold the camera steady enough at that long zoom to either frame a desired shot or maintain a specific center focus point. As a result most of my long handheld shots are either unintentionally framed incorrectly or out of focus. You must use a tripod for such telephoto shots which defeats purpose of carry anywhere in pocket. If you want long shots, you are much better off with a bulky DSLR.This camera like any other light small cameras will give better consistent results only up to about 200mm equivalent.You will probably get better zoom control with the F660 which cost less and has a zoom range of up to 360 instead of 500.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery life is about 3 days!", "Author": "JLP", "ReviewID": "R2EO1ZQSKD6HJK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before purchasing this camera, you should be prepared to purchase additional batteries, and keep them charged at all times.

This was the last camera I compared and I was expecting to really like it as Image Quality is my first priority criteria, followed by video, then features/usability.  Here's my main takeaways:- Well lit, ISO 100-200 shots: Fuji gets 3rd place.  Canon SX260HS has best detail with least noise.  Panasonic ZS-15/19/20 are next best with slightly better detail than Fuji with a tiny more noise.  Sony ties for 3rd with Fuji with slightly less detail and noise (Sony has the most agressive noise reduction of the 4 so there is a little bit more detail smearing.)- Fuji is almost unusable for video.  When you pan the camera the video stutters.  Even worse, when you zoom, camera has MAJOR problems focusing to the point the camera will not focus properly at all most of the time beyond 7X zoom.  The lens motor is also the most audible out of all the 4 cameras.  Panasonics you can barely hear the lens.  Sony wins with Panasonics coming in a close second.- Low-light / High ISO: Fuji comes in second. Sony wins. Panasonics come in third - images are unusable beyond ISO 800, too much yellow color splotching all over.  At ISO 400, it is practically a tie between Panasonic, Fuji, and Sony.  At crazy ISO 1600 and up, Fuji wins with usable images (barely) followed by Sony but you really can't expect much from these small cameras with small sensors at those kind of ISOs.- Flash: Fuji comes in third.  Very strange flash that only pops up manually (which has its benefits).  You must press tiny button on side of camera really hard.  Flash is not motorized and it looks like a part of the camera that could easily break in the future.  Flash is underpowered compared to the other cameras.- Design/Usability/Software - Fuji is heaviest of the 4 cameras but has a nice rubberized feeling body finish.  Panasonic is amazingly small. Sony in-between.  All of them have different styles of software.  Panasonic has best set of software features.  Sony very limited in scene modes.  Fuji has nice software but many of the options are locked out when in any mode other than manual.  Panasonic's wins as far as the Intelligent Auto function. Very reliable.  Canon had troubles focusing sometimes.Overall, Panasonic wins.  Fuji would be a close second, tied with Sony if the video wasn't so terrible.

There are a LOT of settings in the camera that most people would be intimidated by. However, there are AUTO settings for the beginner, so anyone can really use this camera for simple shooting.  Unfortunately, I could not figure out the GPS function (or, rather, why it wasn't tagging my pics), and when I turned it on it drained the battery tremendously (which the camera itself warns you about)...  I had it on for less than 30 minutes, battery was drained and none of my pictures are marked with locations, even though the camera was indicating that the function was ON.... again, the instruction manual failed to give good information - very, very disappointing.The 20X zoom is GREAT, but you really need a tripod to use it as it's super sensitive and almost impossible to get a clear shot from shooting in hand.  I was very disappointed about this on my trip to Germany and France where I wanted to ability to shoot landscapes and landmarks from afar (and also wanted GPS function!). I could have done more research ahead of time; this is probably common for all high zoom cameras.The batteries are rechargeable so I bought a few extra (Wasabi) and was glad I did so that I could change batteries when out and about; one battery won't last a day of touring and shooting.Over all, the camera is good quality and takes nice shots of people and places in every day use with auto settings. I actually got mine for $149 through Groupon!  Can't beat that; but you have to wonder, if the camera were so good, why were they getting rid of them cheaply in bulk on Groupon...

I've packed this camera in a small carrying case in a saddle bag for hundreds of miles over the months I've had it and it travels very well, beach, mountains, whatever - I wouldn't call it delicate - I'm pretty tough on stuff.I am so very happy with this camera, the battery lasts a very long time and it charges quickly on the charger.  I have a lot to learn about using all the specials features that come with it, and I am looking forward to playing around with them.  I did purchase the Square Trade warranty when i bought this camera from Amazon.  I would gladly buy this camera again, recommend it or give it as a gift - Wonderful quality camera!!", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Resent the fact that detailed instructions are not included", "Author": "A Virginia Customer", "ReviewID": "R1IBJARK6WRO9U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the camera to upgrade and improve my minimal photography skills, and I think it has great potential, but the big flaw as far as I'm concerned is the fact that it is loaded with bells and whistles but it comes without instructions as to how to use them (other than brief, basic get-started tips).  I consider it a very poor business practice of the Fuji company to not include detailed instructions explaining how to use this camera.  Yes, they informed me that I could download and print the 85 pages of instructions off of the internet, but for the price of the camera I expected the company to provide them inside the package, and not have it be my responsibility.

The one thing that the Fugifilm F770EXR had over my Canon is that it takes RAW format images. I like to process my photos in High Dynamic Range (HDR) and the software I use (Photomatix Pro version 5) allow you to take three or more images using Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) which my Canon has, or one RAW image. I take a lot of photos while flying and taking three successive shots from a moving aircraft does not lend itself to HDR processing as the three shots are essentially from three different angles. It would be the same as taking three shots from a moving car. The one single RAW image from the Fujifilm solves the moving images problem, however the RAW image is pretty poor quality. My Canon SX1-IS shoots nice RAW images but is not compact enough to carry on your belt. All three have the 20:1 zoom but Canon will be my choice from now on. Another flaw with the Fujifilm F770EXR is there is NO manual focus. I can't believe it.

Compact size, Raw capabilities, ultra long zoom, 16 MP, large screen, hd video, etc. However, I think this camera has fallen short in many areas. I am a photographer who owns Canon 5d mark II and 50d. I use mainly L glass lens. However, I have owned many point and shoot cameras from Pansonic Lumix to Canon elphs. Even the digital cameras I have from 5 years ago take better pics than this camera.I feel the camera out of the box seems to feel right in your hands. It feels ergonomically correct. The image stabilization seemed to be fine. This is where the positive review ends. The build quality of the panasonic, olympus, and canon elph cameras I had previously felt as if they were bullet proof. This camera felt like I would be afraid to take it out of the case to avoid damaging it. When turning the camera on, the lens elements just feel cheap, loose fitting,  and plastic (prob because they are) I honestly was stressed about dropping it because it felt as if the lens elements would shatter into 10 pieces if I did. The pop up flash seems to have way too many moving parts, and it just seemed like it would break sooner rather than later. I felt like if you accidentally bumped it against something, it would mangle the flash , and you would never be able to close it again. The main problem with this camera is the photo quality. In low light, this camera is not usable at all. I was looking for a camera producing images a few steps above my iphone camera and a few steps below my slr's. Something I can take with me to capture images without lugging around all of my gear I will tell you that my iphone 4 camera blows this thing out of the water from exposure to noise levels and everything in between. The only exception, being the flash is better on the Fuji, but that is obvious. The noise levels are so high at all ISO levels I could not believe it. There was alot of noise even with the indoor flash in good indoor light. This was completely unacceptable, especially in a camera that costs almost 400 dollars. Even the outdoor shots I took had noise in daylight. The lens seemed kind of jumpy and had difficulty focusing along the way. Using the long end of the zoom indoors was next to impossible. The manual controls on this camera were really kind of worthless too. The A and S modes are worthless because they jump from like f5 to f11 with nothing in between. The manual mode exposure seemed to be way off, and every time i switched to the easy auto mode, the exposures were much better and more accurate, which is kind of pointless. There is no point in having manual controls over exposure if the camera winds up taking worse pictures. Not to beat a dead horse, the battery life seemed fairly dismal as well.  After putting in a fully charged battery, 50 shots later (15 flash shots included)  the battery had already decreased to half.  I didn't really test the video, because it really didn't even matter to me at this point. lol  In summary, this camera on paper seemed to be the perfect camera. However, in practical usage, I feel this camera would make a better paperweight. The bottom line is when you spend this much on a camera to have RAW, manual controls, super zoom, 16MP, and compact size, it needs to be practical, efficient, and deliver on taking photos that rival or beat the competition. This camera is not that one, at least for me. I guess its possible that I just bought a bad copy, but I doubt my copy could have all these issues. Its gone back to amazon, and I'll keep reaching for my iphone for the time being.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Might be a fine camera, but...", "Author": "Lynne S.

The image quality is significant better at wide angel.+ 16 Mega Pixels- Picture quality at night time is very poor, even at wide-angle; far below average of other cameras- Daytime pictures at 8X or more suffer heavy in quality- Camera is let down by a very poor lens and auto-focus system- Auto-focus keeps on hunting at 14+ zoom. It simply does not find a sharp picture in most conditions. I only found once that the autofocus worked at 20X; that was a far landscape, very clear day. Picture was still extremely poor. I checked in a shop another 770EXR, and exactly the same issue.- Controls and menu are confusion. Also, it's not easy to find the menu itself. Till today I struggle finding the menu and settings. Nikon and Sony do much better in this respect.Fujifilm is a very strong brand; with excellent products. I think however, they missed it with this model. I think they went too far with the zoom lens and had to make compromises, that resulted that even the wide-angle range of the lens has lower quality than average, I rather had paid more for this camera with a good lens....I truly recommend people not to purchase this compact camera, but go for a Fujifilm with an 8x zoom lens or so. 8x is the best compromise, and crop the picture afterwards to get a higher zoom (results will be much better).
