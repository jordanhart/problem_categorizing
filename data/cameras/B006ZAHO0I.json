{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Its a great buy for your money", "Author": "schorkb", "ReviewID": "RXP15BQI2YL1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the reviews for this product, and decided to try it for myself anyway...(2 and a half stars; REALLY PEOPLE???) Anyway, this is an amazing camera for a person who wants a simple point and shoot camera. I have read reviews exstensively on this product. Everyone should do their research when buying a camera that is less money. Most complaints I have read are people complaining about picture quality, light, video and handling problems. Let me start foremost by saying; picture quality. Many people complain about the quality of the pictures taken in odd lighting, or dark places such as in concerts...there is a menu on your camera that lets you choose between many different setting such as daytime and night! I have taken crisp, clear pictures in the dark, in odd lighting, and in places with flashing strobe lights! I've yet to have a grainy picture or odd light quality. Second, the video is pretty darn good for a camera that is now selling for only 100 dollars. Petty complaints like it won't zoom while filming with sound on is...well, just what I said; petty. Would someone want the sound of their zoom motors buzzing away in the middle of a video? No. Lastly, I'd like to address the complaint of the awkward handling. Yes, some buttons accidently get pushed and you need to get used to your equipment just like you get accostumed to handling a musical instrument. The lens cap is a bit iffy but it is meant for when you are not using or handling the camera (sitting on your desk, and you dont want dust on it). Also, I have read so many reviews (it makes me seriously ill), that say when they slide the compartment for batteries open, that the batteries fall out....okayyy....first of all, WHY ARE YOU HOLDING THE CAMERA UPSIDE DOWN WHEN YOU OPEN THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT?!?!? I mean, seriously??? It's called gravity, people. Olympus isnt responsible for making your batteries or battery compartment gravity-proof. My advice...before you use your camera, before you even TOUCH it, read your manual cover to cover....STUDY it. I don't care if you hate reading. Chances are, you are not going to take this camera out of the box and know every little thing about it. Also, don't make petty complaints over a $200 camera when you aren't able or willing to dish out 600-800 dollars for a top of the line model. Get real, people...", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R347J9JG461KXW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Given that this was designed as a point and shoot with a ultra long zoom, it is great value at well under $200.00.  This is not for those that want to do professional level photography.  This camera takes very nice pictures in decent light, gives you a great telephoto reach, allows ultra close up macro photography and is easy to use.  Certainly a great deal for the target audience.  If you like to just point and shoot, get nice pictures and want a long zoom, you should consider this camera.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well worth it", "Author": "Cheetah", "ReviewID": "R1XDVS0FPNGBTV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For quite some time I've been looking for a camera that I thought would be impossible to find. I needed a good zoom, macro capabilities, panorama stitching in camera, good low light performance and good image quality. This little camera has all of the above. It's super easy to use, very intuitive, and also has \"super macro\" setting which lets you zoom in really close. The panorama mode takes a little practice, but I've been able to take a couple of good photos the first time I used the camera.I like the fact that ISO can be adjusted in many settings which gives you more control. I think it tends to produce slightly overexposed images, so ISO adjustment is a good option here. This camera does excellent in low light. I don't like using flash, and it performs great without it, without noise. And I personally like the fact that the flash does not pop up automatically in low light situations. You have to manually lift it out of its \"nest\".It also has its own small internal memory in case you forget your SD card, but most cameras have it nowadays.Yes, it's a point-and-shoot camera, and it's not ideal. Here are some things I am not as thrilled about.It uses 4 AA batteries. Needless to say, if you love taking a lot of pictures and unless you use rechargeable batteries, you will go through them quickly. Also, the slot for your SD cards and AA batteries are in the same compartment, which makes it really awkward. You have to hold it upside down so the batteries don't fall out while you trying to slide the door open and get/insert your SD card. Meanwhile, it's really easy to accidently push \"ON\" button, and your camera turns on, the lens extends forward, the lens cover falls off, etc. And all you were trying to do is to get/insert your SD card! So, it's kind of a painful process. They should have its own separate compartment for the SD card.And a minor flaw is the lens cover. It doesn't stay on the lens when you turn your camera on. Just sits there if you are holding your camera in a perfect horizontal position or slides off. So, I have to take the cover off first and then turn it on.So, there is it. Just depends on what you need in a camera and what you can live with.To me, it has all the features I wanted for a very modest price. And all the things I find less than perfect have to do with the ergonomics/design of the exterior, not image quality or camera features. And if you combine camera capabilities with photographer's capabilities, you can produce great photos. That's why I still gave it five stars.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "ang", "ReviewID": "R2YRSBQ2JN3BHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very good for the price.you cannot buy anything better then the olympus digital camera.the price that i paid was 99 dollars.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "High zoom for low budget", "Author": "Ely Shemer", "ReviewID": "R2BD0LVBVUBJL8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Olympus SP-620UZ is the kind of camera you might buy if you're looking for a model with high zoom, but you don't have the budget for one of the expensive options available out there. It's certainly a model which you should consider buying, though you should keep in mind the fact that it's not a perfect model. The performances offered by this camera are quite good and it's a model that delivers plenty in return for the money you'll spend on it.It will look a bit like a DSLR, which is always a plus.

The link got me to Robert's Camera in Indy, they had 2 left at only a crazy low after Christmas price($120). Some of the reviews in here are way off the mark. If you want a perfect camera then move up in the dollar amount & stop complaining ! The market has hundreds of cameras that will do a better job from $399 to well past $3000. But for the money in this price range it can't be beat ! Ultra 21X zoom with all these features Olympus has everybody beat ! This camera serves me perfect. Works great for web uploads too. Read all the features this camera has and do a side-by-side comparison.... I did for a few hours and bought this 1. THIS IS NOT A POCKET CAMERA! It is a real camera. Please understand we have pocket cameras & bigger ones too but for a nice point & shoot+++ with ultra zoom, HD, and much more this model Olympus fits perfectly in between.

I think it's worth mentioning that the major sticking point for me with this camera has been the abysmal battery life.  I've run through at least 10 sets (40 total) alkaline batteries in the year or so that I've owned this camera - with light to moderate usage.  I get maybe 100 pictures per set of batteries and then the camera will turn off when trying to take a picture or zoom.  And the thing is, the batteries themselves are still at maybe 75% charge - I can use them in flashlights, my work pager, or other cameras with no issue.  This camera just seems to have crazily high drain on batteries and will cause you to burn through many more fresh ones than any other device I've owned.  Still, a good value for the money.  I couldn't go below 4 stars just for the battery issue.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Olympus SP-620UZ 16MP Digital Camera with 21x Optical Zoom (Black)", "Author": "Shady Yang", "ReviewID": "RKH6G1OC0JHM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love my camera.

Its overall great, the zoom is really good, and give a clean shot even without a tripod (at times). Night images are as expected from a typical point and shoot in this price range. The only draw back that I have and its nothing major - and its probably due to me not finding it yet, is that I cant take monochrome pictures. But that's pretty much nothings really. great camera.
