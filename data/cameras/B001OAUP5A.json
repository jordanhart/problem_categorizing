According to their support people, there is no plan to upgrade the TV-M7 for comatibiity.Also, it does not appear to be able to control the camera steering on a camera such as the TV-IP422W.Altogether, a disappointing purchase.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lacks sound support", "Author": "Marcelo W.

I have Trendnet sound enabled cameras and was shocked to find out this monitor could not reproduce the camera's audio.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "TrendNet TV-M7 doesn't allow camera audio to play", "Author": "GregGarner", "ReviewID": "R35BHZ2CXXOJN2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV-M7 monitor to allow me to watch and listen to our handicapped son in his bedroom at night. Unfortunately, the TV-M7 software will not do audio when it is connected to a Trendnet camera with audio.  It does display the video fine.  I also found that the TV-M7 was very picky about WIFI setup and it would only work on my older WEP access point. I could not get it to work on WPA.  The Trendnet camera worked fine on WPA, and the PC application would allow me to listen to audio from the TrendNet TV-IP422W camera.  To be fair, when I carefully re-read the marketing literature and the user manual, it did not mention that it would do audio when connected to a camera. I just assumed since the display had audio ability that TrendNet would have enabled this functionality.The Display also would not allow you to pan or tilt the camera.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.00", "Features": "View real-time wireless streaming Internet camera video\n.Works independently of your computer with no CD installation required\nMonitor up to 4 TRENDnet Internet cameras on one screen or scan between cameras\nFull photo frame functionality\u2014plays photo slideshows, music and stored videos\nPowered by an Energy Star qualified adapter for a better environment\nView real-time wireless streaming Internet camera video with 7 Inch LCD display", "Name": "TRENDnet SecurView 7-Inch Wireless Internet Surveillance Camera and Photo Monitor TV-M7 (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eA9pfu9RL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001OAUP5A"}}
