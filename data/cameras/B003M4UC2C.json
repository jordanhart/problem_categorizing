{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Inexpensive Camera for Model RC Airplane-ing", "Author": "UncleCalli", "ReviewID": "R171G61E3CK1CZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera (Mini DV MD80 DVR Video Camera) for our son this past Christmas with the hopes that it could be mounted to his model RC airplanes.  It was a gamble, but for the price (we paid around $15 w/memory card) it was a gable worth taking.  This little video camera has turned out to be a fabulous addition to his model airplaning experience.  We were able to very easily mount the camera clips (provided) to the underside of the airplanes with some heavy duty Velcro - and it works out great.The Good:* Price - we paid only $15!* This camera takes fair, not great video.  But for the price it took far better video than I was expecting.  Plenty good enough for my son's hobby needs.* It is small and light.  About the size of two stacked USB thumb drives and weighs only a bit more due to integrated battery.* Charges over USB.* Standard mini USB plug.  No need for a special cable.* Included a wide variety of mounting clips and brackets.  Enough to meet our needs.* Includes a lanyard and lanyard clip right on the camera.  This is great for our needs as we tie the lanyard to the planes as a back if the mounting bracket gives way during flight.* Removable/replaceable memory (standard MicroSD).  This is very handy for a long day out at the air fields - when one gets full we simply drop in another memory card.* Acts as a mass storage device.  Thus no drivers needed on your computer and simple file copies are all that is needed for video file management.* Comes with rechargeable batteryThe Bad:* No display screen.  This turns out to be a good thing for us, as a screen only adds to its size and weight.  But for some this might be a pain as you must down load your video to a computer to view it.* Controls are a bit cramped and confusing to understand how to use.  But that is expected for something so small and for its price.* No zoom.  But what do you expect for $15?  That said the current angle of the view is pretty good for our needs.  If you desire a zoon this is not the camera for you.* Battery is fully integrated and non-replaceable.  But that is expected for this price point.  Even if it were replaceable the replacement would surely cost more than the $15 I paid for it.The Ugly:* The video contains embedded date/time in the lower right hand corner of the video.  I can't figure out how to get rid of it.  It took me many hours on the internet just to figure out how to get the date/time set accurately.  I am not a dumb guy when it comes to tech related things but this was a royal pitb to figure out.  Most of the ways called out online did not work.* The documentation is horrid.  I had to spend a few hours with the internet to figure out how to configure this thing.  I don't care how cheap it is - it doesn't cost much to print some documentation or at least print the URL to where good documentation can be found online.Conclusion:This is a great little camera for our needs and the price.  If you are looking for something small and self-contained that takes decent video for an unbelievable price this is camera for you.  I'm giving it four stars due to the difficulties for configuring the date/time and poor documentation.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW - A Dream Come True", "Author": "J. Smith \"scientist\"", "ReviewID": "RDZ1ZKHKRG68J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really impressed with this little unit.  It puts out really good video for its size.  It is by no means so small that you can place this unit anywhere and no one will notice, but it is small enough to be missed by most people.  The unit works well, but it is difficult to press the little bitty buttons with big honking fingers.  You will get into the habit of using some form of stylus to turn the unit on and get it recording.  It also took me a little practice to understand what the blinking lights mean - am I recording or not?  In the end, there is no limit to what I want to do with this unit.  Now, if only I can find the time to use it like I want to.  I have used this unit to record golf swings for further analysis (its small enough to fit in a golf bag pocket and to be used without making the subject totally uncomfortable), recording helmet video from my daily bicycle ride (attached by Velcro to my helmet), and as a dash cam for my car (attached by Velcro to the back of my rear view mirror - pointing forward) to record idiots and trash throwers.  I did quickly break the spring loaded clip provided, but find Velcro is a more stable means of attachment.This is a great unit for use where a full size video cam will be in the way.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stopped working after first time it was used...", "Author": "Johnathan L Duemmer", "ReviewID": "R6IOSVM8OFEBM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very cheap.

a computer, try using a cell charger that has a USB plug (It's faster).Hold power for 3 secs, then press once on the top button to start recording video, again to stop. If you do nothing after turning it on it will shut its self off after 10 secs.To set the time, create at a .txt file called TAG the format is this YYYY/MM/DD 24: 00: 00. Save this file to the TF card (MicroSD) and go into property's by right clicking, un-check archive, then click save/accept/ok. turn the unit off, then on, take a test video. Connect to the computer, open the file, at the bottom the time stamp should be correct. You can change the time stamp anytime by following the steps above. No you can not remove the time stamp, but it's good to have if you use it to provide evidence in court.--==[ Edited ]==-- 12-10-2013Addition, added short video clip from camera. This is a short video from when I left the recorder on inside a vehicle.--==[ Edited ]==-- 02-17-2014I just noticed the video I uploaded is bad, Amazon must have an issue with there encoding. I can tell you that the video and audio do NOT look and sound that way. My only guess is the conversion over to the format Amazon uses maybe corrupted the file.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "No SD card", "Author": "andrewski", "ReviewID": "R14WCXAPAGMEZL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera itself works quite well for the price.

They not only did not succeed, but the managed to put a nice gouge in the camera lens.

(See my review of the Veho and you'll know what I mean by atrocious.)Was I (pleasantly) surprised!I bought a couple of these and found that the video and sound were outstanding.  OK, \"outstanding\" for something so inexpensive and still pretty darn good for something costing several times more.The only problem I had was the sound activation.  It works but needs a very loud noise to get the recorder to start.  (To get sound activation to work you turn on the recorder, DO NOT press the record button, and DO press the \"Mode\" button.  The red and blue lights will flash rapidly.  When the recorder detects a sound it will start to record and the light will flash less rapidly.  After a couple minutes of silence the camera stops recording and the light go back to flashing rapidly, waiting for the next sound to start the camera recording again.)The only real problem is that, contrary to the title in the product listing, neither order included the 4GB MicroSD card.  Maybe I was unlucky both times and I still think this is a 5-star value.  However, it would be nice if Amazon (in this case the independent seller) included everything they were advertising.Usage Tips: - Inserting a Micro SD card can be a bit tricky and here's the trick.  If you look closely at the slot it appears to be divided in half, longways by a thin metal divider.  Holding the camera lengthwise with the lens pointing upward, the Micro SD card goes ABOVE the divider with the metal conductors facing upward.  After you get the card pushed in you need to slide it sideways slightly to get the latching tab to hold.  The good news is you only need to do this once and can leave the card in the camera.  In fact, if you are lucky enough to get a camera that already had the promised card installed then you don't need to do it at all. - Setting the Date/Time stamp can be frustrating.  There are lots of detailed YouTube videos that provide detailed instructions that didn't come close to working for me.  Here is what did.  You create a .TXT file on the MicroSD card named TAG.TXT.  It needs to be at the top level of the card, not in any folders.  The file contains ONE LINE and specifies the date and time you want to use for setting the camera's internal clock.  For example, pretend it is just before 1 AM on March 22, 2014.  Then the file would contain:2014-03-22 00:58:59There is a space but not a carriage return (newline for the kids) following the final '9'.  That worked for me... sort of.  It got the time stamps written onto the videos set properly. - Turning off the Time and Date stamp... You can't - Using an SD card that is larger than 16 GB... Just plug it in.  At least for me they work fine.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can. I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was missing or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's a good cheap light weight camera.", "Author": "K. Fizz \"Eclectically eclectic.\"", "ReviewID": "R26ZY3X5AXBAW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to use with RC helicopters and planes.  The main appeal was price and the fact that there were no buttons the back or front so mounting will be a breeze (see the end of the review for more on that).The video is great considering the resolution...what I mean is...it's only 720x480 which is a FAR cry from HD but I knew the resolution when I bought it and it's what I expected.  But I have to ding it a star for 3 reasons:#1.  There is no 4gb card like the title says.  It DOES say in the description that a card is not included and after reading reviews I didn't expect one so I bought a cheap 8G sandisk to go with it.  But ding for a bad title!#2.  The instructions are crap--poorly translated and out dated.  No disc for drivers like the instruction state, etc.  Ding 2.#3.  The sd card slot sucks.  On my second insertion of the card I missed the internal slot and jammed it into the device.  It took some careful paper clip surgery to get it out.  Ding 3.But not all is lost.  It appears there have been some nice firmware updates so a disk is not needed AT ALL.  But you can't follow the instructions to set the time and such so let me tell you what I did on my Windows 7 PC.1. Put the memory card in the camera.  DO NOT FORCE IT...if it's not going in it's probably upside down.  The metal contacts should be pointing it the same direction as the lens.  Make sure you get it into the slot and not above it or you'll need to dig it out with something.2. Hook it up to your PC's USB port (I used a 2.0 port).3. Use your PC to format the card..I didn't take any chances.4. Let it charge a bit.6. Remove the USB plug.7. Click power.  Wait a few seconds for the red light to flash.  Click Record (on the top).  Record a bit.  Click Record again to stop.  Wait a few seconds until it's back to all blue.8. Plug it back into your PC.9. Open up explorer and look for TAG.TXT in the root directory (D: for me) and double-click to open it in notepad.10. Change the date and time to the current date and time in YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss format (all on one line just like the existing date in the file) and save/close the file.11.  Repeat steps 6-8 (to record a new video).12.  From now on IGNORE TAG.TXT (it will be overwritten again, just do nothing with it).  There should be two avi files in DCIM\\100MEDIA.  One with a bad date, and one with a good one.From this point on the date/time should be good.  HOWEVER, I'm not sure what will happen if the battery goes completely dry, you may have to edit the text file again.As for using this with Skype or some other web cam...again...you do NOT need a disk like the instructions state..atleast not with Windows 7 which is what I used.  Just turn the power on on the camera WHILE IT'S PLUGGED IN and it will go from charge/drive mode to live camera.  In other words you won't see the drive in explorer any more.  Also make sure there is a TF (microSD) card in the device even though you technically don't need it.Well that's it.  Now go burn the instructions in effigy because it's crap.  Ok...not completely since the pictures are good and the information about sound mode and what the lights mean are important, but in terms of setup it's crap.After all this I still need to give it 4 stars because technically it did what the specs said it did.  For using it with an RC product I highly recommend buying some stick-on velcro.  Put the one side on the back and front of the unit and the other side on as many RC devices in whatever angle you want so you can move it from device to device.  Once I can fly stuff without wrecking I'll buy a better camera and mount but for me and my 7 year this is perfect for now.  With my amazon prime account I paid under $19 for a low res camera, 8 Gig card and it was in my hand next day...I can't complain.  I also had to marvel at the fact that 8 gig of video fits on a card the size of my fingernail in a camera the size of my thumb and weighs less than a bag of chips.....Mmmmmm...chips....gotta go....", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "If there is a 0 star, I'd give it.", "Author": "gduan2000", "ReviewID": "RCL6FY9TEI29F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received promptly through Amazon Prime.

My camera had a defective microphone and you had to yell directly into the camera to record any kind of audio, even then the audio was muffled.

Shipment arrived very quickly.SD cards were pre-installed by seller.Spouses Office computers were recently upgraded to windows 8 Pro. Some of the Windows 8 PC would recognize cameras when attached via USB and then would stop and not recognized them again.Perhaps seller can advise how and where to obtain a Windows 8 Driver as no Drivers shipped with units?We were able to fully charge units via Windows 8 USB Connection as no other AC connector was provided in the shipment.We updated the \"Tag\".txt ANSI file via removing SD Cards from units and inserting them directly to Windows 8 PC in a SD Card Reader..so proper date and time as displayed now. We are able to view and listen to AVI recordings from the units using an external SD Card Reader. I would imagine that can be fixed with a windows 8 driver?Instructions that come with units are type out in broken english, but one can piece it together via the instructions and many you tube videos out there.All in all, Windows 8 driver issues aside we are happy with the units and would recommend them as a very inexpensive way of capturing good quality AVI audio/video.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cost effective alternative to \"Spy Gear\"", "Author": "J.

My son attached this to his remote control truck and made some real cool little videos with it.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay in Some ways", "Author": "Zuhayr Sarker", "ReviewID": "RH9KT9F2ZLHPC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this a few days ago, and I have to say that if you want a camera on the rim of your shirt or the bottom of an R/C airplane, this is great for any spying. It feels really comfortable and It looks pretty sleek. Comparing to many other Spy Cameras, this really rocks. And it's fallen on the ground more than 5 times but still works really good, so your camera should not be messed as any rocking around during shipping will cause no damage unless it is heavily serious which is rather rare and very unlikely.Well I probably chose this particular rating because I guess this camera has got a lot of cool stuff in it, but at the same time a lot of disadvantages. The camera is quite small ranging at a 5.5 cm length, 2.5 cm width, and is 2 cm in height, and is at a pretty good size. It does look a bit cool, and has a smooth feel to it, but still is annoying at times. The USB is at the bottom which does really annoy me when I try to make it stand vertically, even on the stands, but I don't really care about it. The camera does come with good accessories but don't fall for the trick that mentions it comes with a 4GB Micro SD card. It really doesn't and that is just annoying. Another thing to watch out for is the fact that it is not the real version of the MD80. I've tried to use it as a webcam, but that doesn't really work. There is NO drivers for this MD80 which really stinks in some ways. But I have to say, the fake one probably has better video and sound quality, though I just can't get the MD80 to get pictures yet, which doesn't REALLY bother me, but still makes me feel bad. But other than that, I've got to say that this is one of the coolest camera's I've ever seen for it's size, shape, portability, and usefulness. This isn't a must-buy, but is definitely one of the coolest things ever in my opinion.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for price", "Author": "jamie", "ReviewID": "R3E0LJK19W2ZNL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It does what it says mic is alittle to noisy but works for me and whst i need just fine", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "not very good camera", "Author": "RCDC", "ReviewID": "R1DHKZ4TWP3KAB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I brought this camera to use while riding 4 wheeler's. got it in and tryed it out and the video was graining and jitter, and disclored couldnt see what was on video.

The instructions are in Chinglish, so you might as well toss them. At first I thought the camera had shipped without the micro SD card, but found it taped to the inner packaging. I connected the camera to my computer to charge it and tried to use it during the charging. Don't, it will only frustrate you. I managed to lock up the camera and it appeared dead. At this point you need to walk away and give the camera time to reset. Once it is fully charged you can take a video. Disconnect from the USB device. Hold down the power until the leds flash then release it. When the flashing stops press the record button on top to start and then again to stop. To view your video connect to a computer via USB and locate the camera as a drive. The files should be there. You can also remove the micro SD card and view the card as a drive. Once you are able to view the videos you will want to change the time and date. You do this by editing the TAG.TXT file in the root directoy of the micro SD card. The file data needs to be in text format as follows \"2013-11-03 20:32:00  TAG. \". \"Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second  TAG. \". You can edit via the USB connection or directly on the micro SD. With the camera disconnected and the card installed turn the power on and off twice. This will set to the time to the new file and you are ready to rock-and-roll.

The first one performed so well like $80 plus cameras and for the harsh duty that I got the same one again. The video is too hd good plus the motion with a class 10 write speed sd card. This new cam looks the same and the same packaging. No charge and took some quick shots with several seconds of charging. The video is like before with the came with the price sd card. It's good enough but has some jounce motion to it but free. I think low charge and no sound in protect mode. Even if so it's so cheap and keep it but needs more charge. This type of buy like gray legal market is highly tempting to get for performance at a super price and sometimes better than US factory. Choose carefully and get a super deal. Understand may some have tech support problems and warranty if from another country market. Usually low instruction but great deal. You should get a few of these for less than battery price. This unit looks like can be modified. Disclaimed: own risk. The battery life may be extended due to 2 red and black wire terminals to the battery but has quick look 2 chips on the battery. If so may not work battery boost splicer, due to chip specific requirement (some sort of voltage feedback loop regulatory and diode function  to charge mode). If yours wears out, may try it to replace battery with exact voltage and esp. amperage or slight lower. The usb connector I think will not hold a same voltage phone booster battery pack because will trigger a charging mode like cable and the cam will not take shots but just charge. Looks like chip based battery is boost proof  unless super tech man with equipment. Mine lasted nearly 1 year. Take careful charging procedures and watch out for this type battery memory and this cams specific charging requirements. Don't overcharge to hot. If charge well usually last near 2hours cut and dry and will run my 4gb 10c sd fully even until didn't work at default 3.69 GB. Maybe just led replacement problem or the battery died. Great performing product like in the gopro shots class with good speed sd card. I usually don't charge more than 4 hours with my Bluetooth headset 5vdc charger compatible. Usb I usually charge more than at least 8 hours (Disclaimered). Test shot length and increase increment usb charging times. Test few or else battery memory may.
