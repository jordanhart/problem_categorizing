This Camera is superb. the construction is solid. No outside plastic material. The focus is sharp, and the wide angle aspect gives an excellent view without compromise. The night time led lights are abundant and gives a very respectful total darkness picture.  None of the other cameras I have owned had as many led's as this one. All said, the price is a bargain. You should not be disappointed.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.95", "Features": "Built-in 1/3\" Sony CCD Technology, Color DSP\n420 TV lines high resolution;\n28 built-in long range IR illuminators; IR illuminator effective up to 54 feet\n3.6mm lens for wide view;0 lux with IR LED\nWeatherproof housing.
