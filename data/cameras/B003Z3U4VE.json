First gentle rain and the cameras are wiped out. After several attempts to get with SVAT who manufactures the product, they finally sent the response \"as long as they are not subjected to water, rain, or snow\". Soooo...it is wind resistant and sun resistant. Told them I would contact the BBB and then they said they would provide return authorization instruction. That hasn't happened either. I would not buy another one of their products nor recommend it to anyone else.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Throw your money in a garbage can it has the same results as this setup", "Author": "Domino2178", "ReviewID": "R14VCI2BYKOCX1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Garbage.  Absolute garbage.  System delivered with one camera DOA.  No SD card included as ALL packaging and descriptions say it should be.  When calling the 800 number for assistance, all I got was a busy signal no matter what time of day I called.  Used the contact email on their website, no help at all.  They claimed I had the product in the rain when I had not even sent the bad camera into them yet.  The camera had only been taken out of the box, set on the counter in my kitchen, and tested with the receiver 10 ft away.  One camera worked, the other would not even power on.  By the way their warranty does not cover it if you do leave the camera where it can be rained on, so indoor/outdoor is an out and out lie, and the warranty is a joke as they will accuse you of having it in the rain to avoid having to cover it.  The range is grossly overstated.  I have the working camera on my front porch, and the receiver in my den just to the one side of the front door.  The receiver will only pick it up when I move the camera inside, and it is within line of sight of the receiver.  It does not work through the walls of my house, and my house is nothing special.  The walls are standard stud walls with code required insulation on the outside walls only. I moved the receiver out to my garage, opened the door (so I could actually get a signal) to test the IR at night.  What a joke.  You can see outlines of some objects but if you are looking for detail, well let me put it this way - it could not read the license plate of my wife's car 5 ft in front of the camera. I feel cheated out of the money I spent on this system.  The only thing it is good for is monitoring the room where the base station is in.  So if you want to take a chance with your money, and you are only trying to \"nanny cam\" a room, it might work for you.  Otherwise this system isn't worth the recycle value of the packaging.  What a joke.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Night vision poor", "Author": "littlemischief", "ReviewID": "R1UJH9F8M06B6E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We are not happy with the system.  Positive is it takes good day pictures, and works well for live monitoring.  Negative is night pictures are very poor, it sometimes records then sometimes not at all, the box and remote are poor quality, if one camera is recording then the other camara does not pick up and record. Customer service is poor it took an email to Amazon.com before we got some action from the supplier.  We would have returned it but after reading their return policy it is required to be returned in the original box as new condition with all packaging as when it was recieved, since we put up the stickers and did not have all the packaging we decided just to keep it.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "SVAT / Defender do sell the best that I have had.", "Author": "Dennis P. Rabidou", "ReviewID": "R13AF1YQJXDNUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Due to the crime rate I figured I would add more Security cams. As I have told most of you SVAT and Defender is the same CO. It is a wonderful wireless system. During the day you will view more color but at night it is more black & White but you still can view very well. As always on any elect,related Item please be sure to plug any and all into a power surge unit. I use the APC power packs so if you have a loss of power you can still view your cams. I hooked my vido into my F/S tv's So you can use your remote and view your entire house,and any other location you put your cams. On another note protect your cam from the weather by an over hang from the top. Not to worry your cams will not lose a signal, just make sure you do not to lay the cover on top of the cam's most of mine are under cover each building I have. But yes I must say for the $ it is thumbs up.Respectfully,delton", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "GX301 SVAT cameras", "Author": "Travis", "ReviewID": "R1Y3H2QZUHAPUF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "my cameras arrived quicker than promised.  Set up was very simple.  During the day the video is full color beautiful.  At night you need to adjust brightness to fix the washout from the IR LEDs but you can then recognize people.  Had trouble pairing the second camera but so far dealing with getting it replaced has been ok.  Since its their fault a new one should already be on the way rather than me sending it back and waiting 2-4 weeks but oh well i geuss it'll work out in the end.

It was easy to install and setup - the instruction manual is well written and easy to follow. System has many usable and useful features. Depending on where you place the cameras, the range is more like 50 feet, not 100 feet. Only downside was the receiver unit failed within the first 2 weeks of owning the system.
