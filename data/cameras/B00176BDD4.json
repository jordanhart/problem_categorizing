{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Shoot For The Moon", "Author": "A. D. Lum", "ReviewID": "R2LXYF1FGIUA2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you don't care to know about the art of photography and you don't like to read manuals, don't buy this camera and you can stop reading right here.  Otherwise, read on.I can take any camera and take bad shots with it.  But if I use most modern cameras to their full potential, I tend to end up with great shots.  By that I mean using correct focus, exposure compensation when necessary, and selecting the proper ISO, shutter speed, and aperture for the situation.  Those are just the basics.  There are also other adjustments and tweaks like Face Detection, D-Lighting (Nikon's term for bringing out more detail from dark areas of the photo), white balance, etc..Essentially, if you know how to use all those things (and your camera lets you adjust them yourself), you can end up with some pretty great shots from any camera.  You can get creative in ways that auto-only cameras will not allow.  Some people end up with blurry shots because they don't know how to take sharper shots.  Better shooters can take sharp shots - or they can make them blurry on purpose for an artistic effect.  I personally can't stand blurry shots - except for the occasional shots where only the subjects are a bit blurry (to accentuate motion).This camera has 6 settings that affect the sharpness of the photo - and that doesn't include aperture.  One of them is the macro focus setting.  Although normally used for close-ups, you can keep it in \"macro focus\" in most of the different shooting modes (Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Program, etc.).  The other setting is the Sharpness setting.  By default, the camera is in the middle of the scale.  Some might consider the middle of the scale to be too soft.  Simply click it up to the \"sharp\" level, or one more for the sharpest level.  There are also two clicks down to increase softness.  1 macro + 5 sharpness levels = 6.Why would someone want a soft (not so sharp) photo?  One example is portraits.  In general, people don't like portraits of themselves that show every pore and hair on their skin.  Softening particular subjects can also convey a delicate beauty - say a ballerina resting on a chair.So for those who complain about this camera not taking sharp pictures out of the box, all you have to do is turn it up.  For extra measure, use a small aperture and a good tripod.  You will see the difference.Not all sub-SLRs offer as many options as the P80.  In particular, I like the high-powered zoom, the camera's ability to correct wide angle distortion, the overall compactness (considering the zoom), and the logical way things are laid out.  The image tweaking controls that are most useful are also the easiest to access via the circular multi-control on the back.  I also like that the flash doesn't pop up unless I want it to (it has a manual switch to pop it up).The P80 is easy to carry around and covers all the bases (video, wide angle, super zoom, full manual control, etc.).  If you know the features of this camera and know how and when to apply them, you'll end up with spectacular shots.  It's that simple.This camera has nice features that you may not always use, but for those special occasions, they are nice to have.  One of these features is the ability to move the focus point around.  With your trusty tripod set up, you want to get a surfer off to one side, gazing out over the sea.  But you don't want the ocean to be in sharp focus because you want to immediately draw your viewer's eyes to the surfer.  By clicking the circular button, you move the focus point over the surfer and set the camera to also meter on the focus point (so that the surfer is perfectly exposed).  Add a little flash fill if you like, and Voila!  Instant art.Night shots really benefit from an adjustable focus point.  Say you want a shot of a lonely lighthouse on a cliff at night.  It's off to one side of your shot to give it a more dramatic frame.  With the focus point in manual and the camera set to meter on the focus point, move the focus point closer to the lighthouse until what you see in the LCD looks properly exposed.  If you have to keep the exact focus point a little bit away from the lighthouse to get the right exposure, no problem, just set the focus to lock on infinity (I'm assuming you aren't standing right next the lighthouse).  The same concept will work for public Christmas tree displays at night.  To get the right exposure and focus, move the focus point onto or near the tree that most interests you.Want to take pictures of your friends, and maybe get in the shot yourself?  Switch on face detection, hit the self-timer and take your place next to your friends.The sports mode will have your friends lining up to get their golf swings and tennis serves photographed.  The camera shoots 13 frames per second in the default mode, sacrificing everything for speed (aperture, ISO, etc.).  So while your shots from this mode won't make the cover of SI, everyone will get a kick out of seeing themselves in a stop motion sequence (up to 30 frames).The camera has two modes which help you get the best shot in unusual circumstances.  In Best Shot Selection mode, it shoots up to ten shots as long as you hold down the shutter release button.  Then it automatically selects and saves the sharpest picture in the bunch, discarding the rest.  In Exposure Bracketing mode, it applies three different levels of exposure to the same shot.  One of them is likely to be just what you wanted.  Exposure bracketing can even be fine tuned to your liking (read the manual to learn how).With a single press of the shutter release, this camera can automatically take and assemble 16 shots, 1.1 seconds apart, into a single picture.  You get a picture made of 16 consecutive \"scenes\".  This is good for things like a cat playing with a ball, or you and your buddy making funny faces.Do you wonder who or what knocks over your garbage cans when you're not home?  The P80 can shoot time lapse sequences, firing once every 30 seconds to once every hour.  It turns off between shots to conserve power, or you can buy an external power supply.Hate crooked pictures?  Push the DISP button to lay down a grid which you can align with horizontal or vertical objects.  The grid also helps you position subjects according to the \"Rule of Thirds\", which even amateur photographers should know.The digital zoom is cool!  It doesn't just enlarge and crop - it interpolates to fill in detail that might otherwise be lost.  If you go full optical and full digital zoom, you can see the craters and \"seas\" on the moon!  Use a tripod, lock the focus on infinity, turn off VR, and use a 2 or 10 second delay to allow the tripod vibration to settle.I'm quite pleased with my purchase.  If you're the creative type and a camera nut (you actually read the manual and experiment), you'll probably be very pleased; producing countless pictures suitable for framing.  If you just like to point and shoot, this camera is probably not for you.But don't just take my word for it.  Go to Flickr and do a search on \"Nikon P80\" to see what this camera can do.", "Date": "May 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Average Image Quality, some quirks", "Author": "RonAnnArbor", "ReviewID": "R6SCME0OX9VB3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I tried this camera this week, and found myself returning it within a couple days. In all honesty, I had read good things and I had hoped perhaps this would serve me as a bridge camera between my Canon G9 and my dSLR camera.First, it is nicely made, and feels good in the hand. It works smoothly, and is relatively quiet during operation. The lens is high quality, and it has the standard Nikon layout on the selection dial. Curiously, it maintains the separate setting on the dial for SETTINGS which should be standard for all creative zone options. This is similar to all other recent Nikon cameras.In use, the camera feels more like a point and shoot than a true tool of the trade -- and therein my average review. If you are working your way up from a point and shoot and not quite ready for a dSLR, this might be the camera for you.But based on my observations: the camera had a difficult time focusing in low-light conditions, and then defaults to grainy high ISO defaults -- sure you can set that, or use Manual mode, but it won't work right out of the box in auto or Programmed Auto  or Aperture or Shutter mode.The image quality is fair -- many photos needed saturation boosts -- they just seemed bland out of the box. Again, this is programmable, for those who venture into the menu, or those who like playing with photoshop.In general, all photos looked soft, and they all need sharpening in photoshop. This is something I would clearly not want to waste my time on with every photo taken that I might want to use for print purposes. The image quality just us NOT what you would expect with a camera of this price. That being said -- the image quality is consistent from closeup to faraway landscape. There is no noticeable loss of IQ with longer focal distance shots, which is better than most superzoom compact cameras I have seen. Closeup macro shots appear the sharpest: if you like taking photos of bees on flower blossoms, this is your baby.While the photos do not lose IQ at the far range of the considerable 18x optical zoom -- they suffer from severe purple fringing at that end -- worse than many other superzoom ultraportables I have seen.The VR works as promised -- provided you are moving and your subject is not moving. I couldn't get clear images of moving objects without significant futzing with the settings.The shutter lag is considerable, nowhere near the rapid response of a dSLR -- and compared to my Canon G9, significantly slower than that as well.This compares favorably to the Canon S5 and might in fact be better than that camera -- but the image quality is not better than the Canon G9, which remains the absolutely best Image Quality camera out there at this price point (without the zoom lens, of course).I'm not going to rant and rave and say this is a terrible camera -- it just seems incredibly average at this price range -- take a look at the Canon G9 for faster shutter speed, better image quality, and similar manual control.I will say one thing -- for those who like to isolate their subject from the background (i.e. blur your background, with good depth of field) the Nikon P80 excels at that -- I haven't quite seen as nice aperture priority images in a point-and-shoot as I have with this camera.But overall, it's a highly priced point and shoot, which won't satisfy advanced camera users.", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "SEISHA SEICHU", "Author": "NeuroSplicer", "ReviewID": "RD28DMSDU727I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is what practitioners of Kyudo, the Japanese martial archery, seek: \"correct hitting is in correct shooting\". And this is how this camera makes you feel after mastering and getting used to its controls and abilities.After months of research I decided and bought this ultrazoom. SLRs take better pictures but I refuse to carry all the extra equipment when on vacation. NIKON P5100 was the choice on the other end but it lacked both the x18 tele and the wide end zoom.The (close) second contender was OLYMPUS SP-570UZ but here is why I found the NIKON a better choice and did not regret it: although the OLYMPUS comes with a larger zoom (x20) it is controlled solely by an awkward (motorized) ring that requires both hands and has an uneven feeling. Moreover, both cameras sport 10MP but, contrary to the OLYMPUS which just had more mega-pixels crammed onto the old (550 & 560) sensor, the NIKON comes with a newly developed sensor. On top of that, I avoided the slow and limited XD-cards OLYMPUS seems stuck on. On the other hand, I missed on 2mm of wideness and x2 on tele zoom.I have been using the camera with undiminished enthusiasm for over a week and I have only good things to tell you about it. It took me a while to familiarize myself with the settings - full auto will not get the best results under any conditions. Once that harmonious point is reached though, this is the camera you would want to be using in most situations.Where it looses the 5th star: the flash does not pop up automatically when needed. Forget to do so and a high (and noisy) ISO creeps in. So yes, this piece of equipment is not without its caprices...Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (and Zen masters) warn about the observer altering the event being observed. With NIKON P80 one can obtain the shot visualized either from very close or from afar. And it does so with simplicity and style.", "Date": "May 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Superb User-Friendly Multi-Use Camera", "Author": "tomato cow \"JSC\"", "ReviewID": "R3PB9K5GTJND4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera in a variety of situations and subject matter and I just love it. As a professional in the field, I wanted a camera that would have the zoom capability and the image quality of more costly (and heavier, bulkier 'pro' equipment) combined with the spontaneity and efficiency of a point a shoot, one-hand camera. This camera DELIVERS all that for me in a great little package that is easy to use, light to carry, superbly intuitive to navigate and still yields excellent high quality images. At $400 out the door at a retail store, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I compared it with everything else in that price range and it just blew the others away. If you have $800-$1000 sure, go ahead and get one of the next level dSLRs like the D40 or D60. But if you don't want to be messing with lens changes and like to 'shoot-on-the-go', then you simply can't do better than this camera. It's a versatile, easy to use product at a reasonable price.", "Date": "May 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix P80 ~ ultimately a disappointment", "Author": "Joseph W. Aubele", "ReviewID": "R3B9T8VWPLL9KO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a Nikon fan, and saw this as a economical way of getting DSLR-like features.  In particular the \"super-zoom\" functionality and sports shot setting -- seemingly perfect for the games my children play -- motivated me to pull the trigger on this purchase.I'll leave the in-depth analysis of the camera to others who are more knowledgeable but what has me disappointed are the streaks of light that showed up on several hundred photographs I took, using the high speed continuous setting in the sports mode, late in the afternoon (between 4:15PM-6:00PM) on Saturday, May 10th.After consulting the manual I found the following on page 47: \"If bright objects such as the sun or electric lights are captured during high-speed continuous shooting, vertical streaks of light may appear in the recorded images.  We recommend that you avoid capturing bright objects during high-speed continuous shooting.\"Precisely my problem.There are multiple settings in the sports mode (as well as the manual setting) to try, so I will be doing that before delivering the box to UPS for return, however it is troubling to discover that the fastest programmable shutter speed (1/4000) is best suited for . . . shooting in the dark?If I fall in love with this camera (and end up keeping it) I'll be sure to update this review.UPDATE: Went out recently and tried other settings/features -- images are crisp without any hint of the problem encountered in the sports setting.  As a result I'm bumping my rating up to three stars (though it doesn't appear that Amazon will allow for such a revision?).Will continue to update as developments warrant :)FINAL UPDATE: I emailed Nikon support about the light streaks that appear in photographs when using the sports mode (what they called \"bands of overexposure\").  They were very honest in their assessment -- there's no way to eliminate the problem entirely.  Their recommendation was to utilize the exposure compensation setting (-0.3 or -.07) to ameliorate the effect.  Though disappointed, the quality of the images overall (especially macro) is so good that I have decided to keep the camera.  The overall rating of Amazon reviewers (3.5 as I write this) seems absolutely correct!FINAL, FINAL UPDATE: Purchased a filter adapter from NEXTPhoto.net and a circular polarizing lens.  This has all but eliminated the bands of overexposure that showed up in the high speed continuous, sports shooting mode.  I have also discovered that, with an infrared filter (R72) the P80 is capable of some nice infrared photography (as long as I keep the ISO setting at a maximum of 200 -- 400 and above is very noisy)!FINAL, FINAL, FINAL UPDATE:  As my meager skills as a \"photographer\" improved the limitations of this *class* of camera (i.e. \"superzooms\") left too much to be desired, especially in low light, fast action situations (i.e. image resolution was very poor, and very noisy).  Ultimately, I sold the P80 and am looking at entry level DSLRs (e.g. Canon Rebel Xsi).", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Well Worth the Money", "Author": "W. Ingersoll", "ReviewID": "R37AA654SZDUX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't normally post product reviews, but I wanted to throw in my two cents on the Nikon P80--especially considering the number of negative reviews by seemingly impatient people who used the camera for a day or two and felt compelled to return it. To read their reviews, you'd think this camera was manufactured by blind monkeys.Rest assured, this camera takes fine pictures. In most people's hands, the Nikon P80 produces clear, vibrant images. Will it get you published in National Geographic? Not if you returned it the day after you bought it! Besides, even the best cameras can't make up for a lack of skill.I purchased this camera because my previous point-and-shoot, which served me very well for 5 years, was too limited in its capabilities for what I wanted to do. On the other hand, a full DSLR camera was more than I needed. I saw the P80 in a local store and realized that it was the type of camera I was looking for. I read the reviews here, and had to filter through the poor reviews because the reviewers seemed too dismissive and too harsh in their judgments.I will be using this camera mostly for outdoor use. I do a lot of hiking, canoeing, and snowshoeing, and along the way I take a lot of pictures. Some of these pictures wind up in print, both B&W; and color. The camera I had been using was small enough to fit in my breast pocket, which made it easily accessible and allowed me to be spontaneous. But a smaller camera has obvious limitations, which I sometimes ran into while trying to prep a shot for publication at 300 dpi. Don't get me wrong, that little 5-mp point-and-shoot worked well for me, but I wanted to see what I could do with a larger, more sophisticated camera.The P80 is too big to fit in my pocket, but it is light enough that I won't mind taking it on week-long wilderness hikes. I have only owned the camera for 2 weeks now, and so far I have only been using the automatic settings while I get a feel for its capabilities, but already I have taken several shots that I like very much. The resolution is perfect for what I'll be using it for. Chances are, if I used a tripod the images would be even sharper. A full-size image works out to be 9 x 12 inches at 300 dpi. You can, of course, set the camera to take smaller pictures.One thing I've noticed from two weekend hikes is that the battery has a more limited life compared to what I'm used to with the smaller camera. Having been sure to fully recharge the battery the Friday night before my trip, I have been getting the \"low battery\" indicator by Sunday afternoon on both trips. Granted, I've had a bad case of \"new toy syndrome\" and over time I will probably learn to conserve battery power better. In the meantime, I plan to buy a back-up battery. It couldn't hurt. One thing that I've missed is an indicator that tracks battery power from start to finish, not just one that flashes when the power is low.Another minor fault--which I can learn to live with--is that the on/off button can be a little too easily triggered. While trying to put the camera back in my backpack, I've accidentally touched the button and turned it on a couple times.One thing I wasn't clear on when purchasing the camera from Amazon was what it came with. For the record, the following items come in the box with the camera:* Battery recharger* Rechargeable battery* USB and AV cables* A strap long enough to hang the camera from one's neck* Software CD, especially helpful for managing the file upload processThe internal memory is good for ~18 images at full resolution. I bought a 4 gb SD card, with a capacity of ~850 images.So, if you're looking for a camera somewhere between a POS and a DSLR, don't pass this one over thinking it only takes grainy, blurry images. It is a fine camera, especially for the price I bought it for. I haven't regretted it, and I am looking forward to getting to know it better.I give it 4-1/2 stars.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon p80", "Author": "Donna Shields \"roncinante\"", "ReviewID": "R2P2ZFNMNUB9P8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is simply my point and click.  This might be  to complex for the entry level digital user because like other reviewers I use a Cannon. Yesterday at a swim party I used the L400 lens for the distance face shots, but I used the p80 for the cake and presents shots. To me Photoshop is as necessary for photos as a good lens.  I know I lose a lot of shooters when I add all the complicating issues.  This little camera is very light and is in my purse at all times unlike my Cannon.  I use it to all of its potential.  You have to read the book and practice to enjoy all it can give. I love the spot meter and focus used at the same spot. I can shoot faces in the dark and have face colors that are quite good and from my purse to photo takes seconds.

While this camera is classified as a point and shoot, and it certainly can be that, it does have some overides such as aperture and shutter priority and manual.  Without the overide capabilities I wouldn't have been interested since I want creative control of my shots.  Just out of the box last night I found that the macro worked fine as did the mega zoom.  Mid range shots had stunning clarity.  I noticed some noise on low light macro shots.  So far I like this camera.It would have been great if Nikon would have included RAW image processing.  I would have much rather had that than the capability to make short videos.  I also would have liked it if it were possible to thread filters on to the lens, which it is not.The user's manual is really clear and understandable for someone used to working with DSLRs.  I was able to load images on my computer using USB1 and Windows XP with no problem.  I ignored the Nikon photoloading program and sent the images to Photoshop.I would definitely suggest getting an additional memory card, since if you are shooting on the 'fine' setting it does not take long to fill up the camera's internal memory.  For example if you shoot 10 images at the 'fine' setting the 50 MB internal memory will be full.When this camera arrived at my home via shipping through Amazon the driver just left it on the doorstep.

The Nikon P80 fits this \"tweener\" area nicely.I have owned the camera for about 6 weeks and have taken over 1000 pictures with it. It's accompanied me to a pro football training camp, kayaking and canoes trips, parties and multiple family occasions. My original concern that this camera would be too big to tote around is simply not the case. It's become a wonderful companion.A bullet list of observations:- The zoom is incredible. I shut off the digital zoom feature completely. Found that I didn't need it and figured it would maximize sharpness. I do less cropping of pictures now with this camera than before.- The sport shooting mode is wonderful. I use it more than I thought I would.- I shopped around extensively and the reasons I chose this camera over the comparable Sony and the Canon, Lumix models were: This camera had a better zoom, used SD cards, had a more solid feel and had simple controls but yet had equally extensive features. Above all the others it felt good in the hand.- Although this camera can act as a \"point and shoot\", by no means is this \"juniors first camera\". I really think the best way to get better results is to take the time to learn about the camera controls/features (RTFM) and learn about how to take pictures. In addition to my purchase of this camera I also bought the book \"Understanding Exposure\" by Bryan Peterson which has increased what minimal knowledge I had about exposure.There are some annoyances with this camera.....- It's slow. If you don't learn to use the camera in other priority modes or manual - you may get frustrated at the slow shutter response and missed shots. I've also found it's slow to zoom focus. The flash also requires some wait time as well (to be expected).- I want to put a lens filter to protect the lens but ... #1 I can't find any and #2 doing so would require a different lens cap. Many have complained about the cheap plastic lens cap, but it's actually designed to easily pop off when you turn on the camera. A more solid lens cap would over time screw up the lens drive. It just looks cheesy.Anyhoo, the camera's not perfect, but I felt I did my homework and made the best purchase for my needs. I am pleased with it and have already recommended it to friends who I think have beyond basic interest in photography.I hope this information helps anyone who is considering this camera.", "Date": "September 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent, Just Excellent", "Author": "J.

I've been taking lots of photographs since I purchased this camera a week ago and I've been having lots of fun with it.  I love the 18x Optical Wide-Angle Zoom-Nikkor Lens and the New Sports Continuous Scene Mode that can shooting up to 13fps plus the Bright 2.7-inch LCD and electronic viewfinder.NOTE: I purchase the NIKON P80 at Costco's for $[...].

It has a nice sharp focus. The streaks you see or read about in the samples or prior reviews are due to the user having the exposure compensation on a positive setting. This makes the picture much brighter than it needs to be. The compensation results in over exposed  and streaky shots. Please note the situation you are in and beware; for example if you are in direct sunlight you would not need to use the exposure compensation. Camera is very intuitive and I would consider it user friendly. Just give yourself a chance and read the manual before you post negitive reviews. For the price you are getting a real decent camera. I am even pleased with the digital zoom which I used at an indoor concert. The VR realy works and helps you to keep you camera shake down to a minimun. Also try using the VIVID or More VIVID settings . I believe you will be pleased with the outcome. I owned many SLR's over the years and I bought this camera to use while I am getting over a cranky back.

I made a direct comparison between this camera and the one I've had for 4 years (Olympus C-750UZ, 10x, 4MP).  The P80 certainly had better zoom range on both ends, was very user-friendly, and faster than my other camera.  Noise in low light was a bit better on the P80, which also had faster shutter speed to help prevent blurring.  However, my Olympus outperformed this camera in a very important area:  image quality.  All of the images from the P80 appear \"soft\" (except very close-up in macro mode, which turned out quite nicely).  Despite its age and lower MPs, my old camera clearly outperforms the P80 in this regard.  Online research indicates that other 18-20x cameras have a similar problem with image quality.  Maybe the technology just hasn't advanced far enough (yet) to produce quality output in such a compact package that includes a telephoto lens.Other than the image quality (which may be just fine for someone who's not making a direct comparison with something they're already very happy with), this is clearly a quality camera.  Aside from the image quality I would certainly give it 5 stars (but unfortunately that is my priority, worth two stars to me).  If you have your heart set on getting a super-ultra-zoom, this could still be the camera for you.  Personally, if I do decide to upgrade in the near future, I will probably go with something less ambitious in terms of zoom power.  I love to take full-frame pictures of birds and other wildlife (which you usually need a decent zoom for!) but I'd rather have a great image with some extra margin than a merely fairly good full-frame image... which is what you get with the P80.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Dynamite all-rounder with flexibility to grow", "Author": "Paul Misencik", "ReviewID": "R3OI7O9CPIM07X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't find much to complain about with my new P80, with its enormously flexible lens, compact dimensions, low weight, and overall picture quality.  Even some of things I have heard others complain about, such as the press-on lens cap and \"uncomfortable\" viewfinder seem like nit picking to me.  Make no mistake, this is a dynamite little camera.I'm what you might call a true \"prosumer.\"  I shoot images for myself, but also for magazine articles and other media.  Even on some of those jobs I now find myself reaching for the P80 over my D40, because the wide array of manual controls allow me to create essentially the same results with a lot less hassle.  Plus, the wide zoom range and host of advanced features means I can carry just one little camera to get a job done quickly and easily.  I hardly every use the full \"point and shoot\" auto mode, preferring instead to maintain at least some control over the aperture and/or shutter speed, and the P80 makes it very easy to navigate and switch modes on the fly.  The multiple flash settings are also very handy, and overall I am blown away by the results I can achieve.  Much better image quality and much more \"DSLR-like\" results than I ever expected.The only two things I wish it had are a manual zoom ring that I could use with my hand (although the motorized zoom has good precision and speed) and a threaded lens barrel to take filters and such.  But these are nothing that would keep me from recommending the camera to virtually anyone.I never looked at super zooms before, sticking pretty staunchly to the idea of DLSRs, but then I heard that an increasing number of top-level photojournalists are using them because of their incredible flexibility.  And now I see why.  The P80 is a fantastic little camera.  If you're a bad photographer, it will help you take better pictures, and if you're a good photographer you can use it pretty much as you would a DSLR, generating excellent and creative results with very little expense or hassle.I highly recommend the Nikon P80.

Not too small, the P80 fits comfortably into my hands and does not wobble as the smaller cameras tend to do. Although I do miss taking splendid photos with my 1974 Rollei SLR with the three lenses and polarizer, I do not miss the weight, the limitations of rolls of film, and the encumbrances of all the accompanying paraphernalia.I especially like the P80 because it is inconspicuous, and one can get candid shots of street life without being intrusive. The easily managed diopter allowed me to use the viewfinder without my glasses. The monitor made it easy to view photos quickly; and the battery charger worked splendidly (I took two Nikon batteries, and charged one every night.). I was also pleasantly surprised at the macro feature which allowed me to copy family photos from my brother-in-law's album, which were taken in the 1940s and '50s.As other reviewers have suggested, reading the manual is indispensable, but one ought not to be tied to it. For instance, I discovered that in the northern latitudes with their bright autumn light, so beloved by the Dutch painters, the \"sunset\" setting worked better than the automatic, or even the plain \"landscape\" settings (I didn't care much for the automatic setting which tended to over-expose the pictures). I also experimented using the shutter and aperture priorities; took night pictures that were eventually successful, and discovered the video option, getting some fantastic shots of the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace (As I discovered when I downloaded the photos onto my computer--a painless process--the sound of the guards' commands and their marching feet, as well as the clip-clop of the horses' hooves, comes through loud and clear. Unfortunately, so does the yak-yak of the surrounding tourists!). Not knowing how much memory I would be using, I took two 4G memory cards and shot 1800 pictures and 31 short videos, which improved remarkably during the second week, as I was getting used to the intricacies of the camera (and was recovering from jet-lag). As a result, I have a thorough documentation of my trip, which I wouldn't have gotten with a cumbersome SLR.Although for the next trip, which I intend to be more leisurely, I might invest in a real DSLR (with a polarizing lens), the Nikon P80 was perfect for what proved to be whirlwind tour of Europe. And any lapses in color or light and shadow, I was able to compensate for for with Adobe CS3.P.S. I must mention a minus, and that is a matter of preference.

The P80 does an excellent job in macro mode though the flash is disabled in this mode and cannot be used for back fill.The scene modes are awesome though using this camera for well over two months, in portrait mode there is some difficulty in adjusting the focus to show the blue box, but even with the red box and flash fill photos turnout very well.In lowest resolution the frame advance is very fast and you can shoot multiple shots without waiting for the camera to save the photo.This is a con when shooting 10MP FINE which is the highest resolution this camera can shoot, it nearly waits for a full 5-7 seconds before it is ready to shoot another frame.The video quality is mediocre and wish that Nikon put more oomph into this mode qiven the fact that the lens is very powerful to shoot. Yet another con is in video you cannot zoom the entire range of the lens which gets you to at most 3X-4X optical zoom.Also the video is restricted to 30 min. clips max but it does create folders that you can edit with the most simple editing software like WMM in Vista. But this is a handy feature to have in the camera if you forgot your camcorder, otherwise stick to a professional camcorder.The battery life seems to be very good, at least for now since it is new, though I purchased a spare just in case (especially for vacations).I use a Delkin Pro 16GB SDHC that can store 10K photos in 1MP resolution or well over 3.5K in 10MP mode.

Reading other comments I feel that some clarifications are necessary since most negative comments are simply pilot errors or unreal expectations, you have to realize that issues like a blurred image, even with Image stabilization can easily happen of you are using a long zoom lense, shots on anything above 10X do bennefit from a tripod, also, if your subject is a mile away there will be a lot of atmosphere in between, UV light, humidity, or even dust.  Usually people don't realize that the light from the flash is nt going to reach on your subject enough to make a diffrence if you are 40 or 50 feet away and of youthought a portrait was fuzzy, well that is another word for soft, other cameras can give you a sharp picture and show too much skin detail so you can reduce the sharpness on the P80 you get a softer picture, you however can increase the sharpness. About the Pixels, 10 is way more than enough, unless you plan to make posters out if your pictures and ASA setting of 400 or more will allways show noise (even on 35MM film) specially at higher MP settings in low light, set to 5MP.  Cheaper cameras can claim to have 14 MP but they accomplish this by dividing pixel size through the software with bad results.The inside thread on the lens allows for a 38mm adaptor ring and I usually have a UV filter for protection and a rubber hood, you will have to zoom in a bit to avoid seen the hood in the frame but don't forget your were using a wide angle setting right? To be able to have the range of wide angle and 18X zoom in one single lense is wonderful, you would have to carry around a big heavy camera with at least two telephoto lenses to cover that range, in 35mm equivalent 18X zoom would be about 486mm lens, check around for the price.

After using it for several months now, I wish I hadn't!  I agree that the Nikon Coolpix P80 can do amazing things.  The manual is extensive, and for someone into photography who wants to set up the camera for each shot, it is a good camera.  I, however, am a stay at home Mom who just wants a camera that produces a high quality picture for cropping, enlarging, etc.  I want to be able to pick up the camera and take a quick shot of my children doing something goofy or spontaneous.  This camera is slow to turn on.  It also has a slow \"reaction time\" between photos, especially if using the flash.  Speaking of the flash, it is \"automatic\", but it does not automatically open when the camera turns on. Therefore, if you are in a hurry and just snap a shot, you then realize you need to open the flash, wait for it to \"charge\" and the moment is gone.  I have many grainy, yellow pictures where I should have had the flash open but didn't think until too late.  It also is difficult to just snap a quick picture without getting a lot of blur.  You must set up for each shot. At my niece's graduation, I was asked to get shots of her accepting her diploma from a closer vantage-point.  By the time the person in front of me got out of the way, I snapped quickly so as not to miss the moment, and ended up with a blob.  I felt awful! Had I put the camera on a tripod and taken the time to adjust all the settings I am sure the photos would be great, but \"on the fly\" it just isn't very forgiving.  The zoom is amazing, but it is nearly impossible to capture the photo without blur. Again, a tripod would solve that problem.This camera takes MUCH better pictures outside in natural light than it does inside.  Outside photos are bright and sharp, even without any preplanning.  Inside photos are most often off color, grainy and dull.

It would be wise to purchase an extra battery or two as well as a couple extra memory cards if you are a shutter bug like me and my wife.  It catches action shots perfectly with no blur. The picture quality is second to none!! I have taken lots of pictures of lightning with this camera and they look awesome!! I shoot a compound bow as well and use this camera to catch the arrow in flight... It does a great job, but you have to time it just right!! The video mode (and sound) is great too, but you can't zoom in and out while filming very well. BUT, for the money, you simply can't complain! I can take pictures and upload them straight from the camera to my computer or printer or straight to Facebook if I want.  Or pull the card and take your pictures anywhere!! Sure, there are a lot better and newer cameras out there, but they carry a lot bigger price tags too!

The zoom was amazing at the time, in comparison to other cameras in its price range. It was a good purchase at the time, and while I realize there is a new version of this camera available, I thought my experience with this particular camera might be helpful to those researching this type of point and shoot.To begin, I am a very amateur photographer, and the P80 was an upgrade from my Panasonic Lumix. I enjoy macro photography, and I had gotten to the point where I'd outgrown the capabilities of my Lumix... and I was reluctant to purchase a DSLR at the time. The zoom capabilities of this camera are impressive. However, after about 12 months of moderate use, the zoom function slowed tremendously. The motor grew more noisy, and the camera's overall performance was sluggish. I cleaned it, reformatted the Extreme III SDHC card I was using, but it didn't help any. Now, I am not a photo guru, but in my opinion, this camera was not made to last. With how fast this type of technology improves, it might not matter as a camera like this will be obsolete before it dies of 'natural causes'. But I paid four hundred dollars for a camera that started to poop out after only a year. This is why I chose the overall rating.This camera will do a fine job taking quality photos in good light... but its overall performance is disappointing in low-light environments (as over reviewers have mentioned). With how the prices of entry-level DSLRs have come down lately, I don't see how this model is practical for the majority of photographers. I have just upgraded to my first DSLR, and I have to say that the P80 is just about as heavy and awkward as my new Sony a390 with the 18mm-55mm lens attached. Granted, when turned off, the P80 is more compact, but not by much... and considering the quality of my a390 over my P80, and the fact that right now, they are very similar in price... if you are looking at this as a possible upgrade, go all the way and move up to a DSLR!", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cool!!!!!!!!!!!

There are some differences so selecting from this group should depend on your preferences and shooting style.  I selected the Nikon P80 based on some reviews and have been very disappointed.The Nikon performs okay in good conditions, e.g. outside on a sunny day.  It is not very good for indoor/ poor lighting conditions.  It is terrible for continuous shooting such as for sports at frame rates of 4 per second or higher.  The problem is that the camera automatically adjusts the ISO setting with certain settings.  Continuous shots at 1.1 frames per second are okay but at 4 frames per second it is not okay due to noise.  At any ISO setting above 100 the noise becomes unacceptable.  Shooting at four frames per second, on a bright sunny day, resulted in so much noise that the pictures were unacceptable.If all you want is to shoot still shots outdoors in nice weather then this is a great camera.  If you want to shoot indoors, in poor light, or continuous mode, then get the Panasonic FZ28 or Cannon SX 10 IS.There is a very good review of the top cameras in this category on the dpreview web site.", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon P80", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R2RM5IGKPDWTVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my Nikon Coolpix P80, on Dec 5, it is a Christmas present to myself.

I currently own a Lumix FX100. Let me tell you that I returned the Nikon yesterday after 2 days of trying to get a decent picture out of it. First off when zooming all the way to 18x you would see shadows on the corner of the picture. The noise was pretty bad and most pictures even in low ISO looked grainy. I could barely get a focused picture out of it and often would have a blurry subject with a focused background (and no I wasn't focusing on the background since my subject was in the center). Finally the video mode although of good quality would not work on my mac. The files are saved in .AVI format and I tried every player I have including Quicktime which usually plays AVI files, but nothing, every single time it crashed. I researched a bit and found out that Panasonic had a similar camera but with 8.1 megapixels for less than $300.

The camera is focused on being a gateway product between the typical compact or pocket camera's and the entry level DSLR's found on the market. The P80 does require that the user actually read the including Instruction Manual to be able to take full advantage of all features. Many pre-set Scene Modes are available including (Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, Party/Indoor, Beach/Snow, Sunset, Dusk/Dawn, Night Landscape, Close Up, Museum, Fireworks, Copy, Backlight, Panorama). The camera is very intuitive and easy to navigate using the bright LCD screen for actions such as changing Scene Modes and reviewing pictures. While I personally love the camera, I can see how others may find it difficult to use in a \"point and shoot\" setting especially in Auto Mode. If you're just looking to take quick pictures and have no interest in photography, you may want to pass on these higher end compacts all together.One of the biggest problems I've read about was the Autofocus and how many images would come out blurred. I have not found this to be an issue. Please remember that this camera does not (nor does any other camera) have a brain. You need to tell the P80 what to do as you would with any other device. If you're taking a shot of a subject in the distance and there is something in the foreground of your view, the camera may focus on the foreground image instead while blurring out the intended subject. The user can easily adjust the focus settings appropriately. Again this requires that the user read the Manual and learn the appropriate settings.The issue of slow recovery time does exist but not only on the P80, but other high end compacts as well. For photography purposes I don't see this as an issue, but for \"point and shoot\" users this could be a problem.The 18X zoom is great and comes as advertised.The Scene Modes work great and so do the Shutter and Aperture priority settings. I would stay away from the Auto Mode as I would normally do with most camera anyways.Physically the P80 is appealing and does not feel cheap. It's slightly smaller than I expected but I've grown to like that about this camera.Overall I'm very happy with the Nikon P80 as it delivers on everything it promised in the marketing material.

Nikon has three different camera series: L (\"Lifesyle series\") S (\"Style series), and P (\"Performance series\").  The Ls are your basic, slightly more bulky, everyday point and shoot styles. They typically run off of AA batteries, hence are slightly more chunky in shape. The menus are very simple, and the price range is usually $100 or less. The S series emphasizes a more stylized, sophisticated design...your touch screen menus, compact hard metal bodies, slim make. These are usually $115-150 price range and use the lithium-ion rechargeable cell battery. The P series is where you're at before you get to a DSLR, & it's a great bridge between the two in my opinion.  Depending on your model, you can expect to pay anywhere from $200-350 on a P series. I owned the P80 for about a year before selling it and upgrading. It served me very well in a variety of situations, though it was certainly not flawless.Pros:  1. Superior zoom/lens quality. You might see that 18x optical zoom and be skeptical, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Even fully zoomed in, I produced crystal clear beautiful images. Of course how shaky the person operating the camera is plays a big role, but with a steady hand you will get great shots. 2. Actual ergonomics. The camera is big, but not so huge that you feel you can't take it everywhere with you. I wore it strapped around my neck while riding bike trails, and as long as the lens cap was secure, I wasn't worried about it. It feels and appears to be very solid and well made.  3. Great battery life. After a full charge, I usually could get nearly 300 shots before having to plug it back in. I am also not big on using my flash though, so that plays a lot into it. 4. Helpful manual. Some cameras give you a 5 page booklet and then you're on your own. Or worse, you get a 'digital manual', CD, and no literature whatsoever. Nikon's manual was not only thorough in explanation of features, but also provides the user with helpful tips in a variety of shooting situations. Lots of illustrations to take the guesswork out also.  5. Full manual controls. Provided you know how to use these, you'll have a lot of fun experimenting. I was able to take some really nice potraits while in manual mode, with the camera effectively fuzzing out the background and sharply focusing on my subject. Sport mode was nice when wanting to shoot several images in succession, however takes some getting used to because unlike a DSLR, you won't hear the clicking of the shots being recorded each time. You hold your button down and it will record until you let go pretty much. Kind of neat, except then you have like 30 images that are nearly identical and have to go through and weed out the bad ones.Cons: Not that great indoors, unless using your flash, which is unfortunate because a lot of the time the flash ruins the ambience of things.  Without the flash, most of the pictures took on a golden tone, sometimes almost orange, which was rather annoying.  Also very noisy indoors!!  They didn't look that bad on the LCD, but when printed you could definitely notice.  The LCD in general could be irritating, because the pictures looked great on there...but on my computer or printed from a lab, they looked much more drab.  It can be kind of tedious having to go in and edit each and every picture just to add some saturation and contrast.  I've owned a variety of Nikons and Canons...I must say that Canon seems to be far better in the way of vivid, sharp color straight out of the box.  The software the camera comes with is definitely lacking. It is basically just for photo transferring, not much at all in the way of actual editing. I was also looking forward to taking some great panoramic shots with this camera, but it doesn't offer in-camera stitching so I didn't bother half the time.  The software provides a stitching tool, but in the end it's just not feasible for someone who takes a lot of shots to go back and locate those specific three. Especially when you have to wait til you're on your computer to do so.In general--very nice camera, good buy for the price. The zoom is great, and the 10 megapixels are nice for making large prints. My complaints are/were only minor in the end, as overall I got some very nice quality photos from this.  I would definitely agree with other reviewers though in that the more experienced photographer will be finicky with this camera's noise level and other 'little quirks' as described. If you don't care about the minute details though, leave the camera on Auto and have at it.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best camera ever!", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "R24LZQO5719LWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the best camera that I have ever had.

I've taken soo many pictures at this point (thousands) and i would say at least 80% of them have been very soft focus.

It boggles my mind that there is grain in the photo i took at ISO100 and in daylight.  It has ruined a lot of good photos for me.I have used every  feature this camera has to offer over these months, thinking maybe I just had the wrong settings or had to tweak something, and nothing has helped.

Maas \"Alex Maas\"", "ReviewID": "R1TEBQXYJNE3CF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not any type of professional photographer.  However, I once read in a column by Marilyn vos Savant, the woman with the world's highest IQ, that the reason photos never seem like being there is because photos do not present what we actually see.  She suggested using a wide angle lens to make photos more like what we actually see in real life.I tucked this information in the back of my mind, until someone I know went to Costa Rica and brought back photos with one of the Panasonic Lumix models that fits in your pocket but has a built-in wide angle lens.  And boy, was I ever impressed--when I thought I had actually read a bad review of that particular camera on one site or another.  The wide angle lens did make all the difference, especially in landscape photos.What I never liked about the Panasonic Lumix  models is the color is somewhat off.  I shoot photos for the Ebay and often the color is off, meaning I have to make sure the light is just right.  With this camera, this is never a problem.Some people complain that it is not perfect for videos or something like this. I think people are really expecting quite a lot from a digital camera these days.  It is NOT a video camera--do you expect a video camera to take great digital photos also?  Probably not.Also it does 18X telephoto--you would have to buy two different Panasonic Lumix models to do the same thing.  I was going to do this since those both fit in your pocket and this one does not. It is not gigantic, but it is rather big.Finally, having a wide angle lens is completely different than being able to take a photo in the widescreen mode.  This only means that the camera has internal software to convert photos to a 16:9 mode--it has NOTHING to do with the ability for the camera to take a wide angle photo.  Some reviewers get very mixed up with this.If you are looking to buy a videocamera, then BUY a video camera.  In the same vein of thinking, both Panasonic and Canon make video cameras with built-in wide angle lenses.  Unfortunately, the Panasonic models take grainy photos.  The Canon model is the FS100. I will review that one later in a separate review.Also, Polaroid has just come out with a 32GB SD card, and I expect other companies will follow. This is not a true HD camera and does not have a hard drive.  If you buy one of those and want a wide angle lens also, it will most likely cost you about twice as much.  I could not justify that expense, but I can certainly understand why people would want a hard drive and HD. However, IMHO, the only thing that looks great in true 1080p HD are movies originally shot for iMAX, such as the last Batman movies.  Almost anything else will look just as good on 1080i with an upscanning DVD player.There are all things that people nt need to think about before investing in a camera.  Of course, in 2 to 3 years, this will all change, and technology will cost less.  However, I prefer to not spend so much money upfront, but others will see it differently.If you are running a low-margin business, you have to be careful not to spend too much, as there are always unexpected expenses.", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera with Great Picture Quality", "Author": "Pranay Gadhawe \"Pranay\"", "ReviewID": "R2O6O2GH5HKACJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera 2 months back and i like the picture quality of the pictures taken from this ,battery is also good only drawback with this is it is a bit slow in processing.... rest it is really one of the best choices for high end zoom cameras.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money.", "Author": "S.

Comparisons to pictures taken at the same time of the same subject with a P80 and a Canon SX100 show clean looking shots on the Canon and speckled noise in the clear areas (like the sky) on the Nikon P80 images when viewed at 100% in Picasa, for example.The P80 also appears to be very sensitive to electrical fields. When shooting near an AC distribution transformer (those green boxes you see in suburbs with buried power) the P80's computer went nuts, the colors in the viewfinder shifted to yellow and green only, and the camera couldn't even be powered off.

It's not like the one from those cheap camera. It actually works well enough that I wanna use it indoor. (I used to use SB800 though.)There's one BIG con about this product I think.Which is, the NOISE from ISO!..I know it's nonsense to compare with D80 for noise reduction, but....From ISO200, you can see a lot of noise in the picture. Even from ISO100, if you zoom in black color in pic, you can see noises. So, you might wanna stick to ISO64 and use flash, or get some noise.The size of P80 isn't that big, and not heavy. There's lens cap you can attach from strap so you don't lose.Overall, I think it's great point&shoot; camera that looks like DSLR but not as good as DSLR.(but price wise, P80 is the best)", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "A.

Now with any independent retailer I would be very suspicious, but not with Amazon. I thought they screened their merchant lists and all but eliminated this bait and switch tactic. And so, I ordered this P80 at the $199 price.When I returned to the website several hours later, both the price and the merchant were gone, but my credit card had been charged for the $199. So now I became suspicious. I called Amazon and expressed concern that perhaps their system has been hacked, but I am told - by someone who barely spoke English, I might add - that this sort of thing happens..i.e..that retailers offer a low price on Amazon and cannot fulfill the order. She then assured me that if a refund was not issued within the next 2 billing cycles, Amazon would help me to try and resolve the issue. Though she was very polite, she was also evasive and talked in circles.Frankly, I was shocked to find that this sort of tactic was permitted on Amazon. Evidently, they do not screen their merchants and so consumers are at the same mercy as they would be if dealing with Broadway Photo or Abes of Maine (2 of the more commonly known culprits of this type of deceit).There was a time in which I thought Amazon was a safe place in which to transact business. Clearly, that is not the case. I would like to add now that the camera which I ordered through Amazon today from CameraSpot is listed as available at $299 on their website.I expect to receive an email tomorrow from CameraSpot telling me that the item is not in stock. Either way, I will update this review with whatever happens when it happens.Buyer beware. Buyer beware of Amazon.Update*****I was contacted by Amazon.com today to tell me that my order was cancelled. No reason given by them, except a lame apology. CameraSpot also contacted me and expressed their dismay that the camera was not available, but that they had a better camera that they would let me have for a discount because I was so valued a customer. It was the Canon sx10is which they were willing to sell me at the discounted price of (drum roll) $399.99. I can get it through legitimate sources at a lower price than their 'deep discount'.I cannot say that I'll never purchase from Amazon again, but I will never purchase through them with any confidence.

I just assumed a company as classy as Nikon would include basic photo editing software. PHOTO EDITING SOFTWARE IS NOT INCLUDED. So you better have some from your old camera.

For the price you pay for this camera and quite frankly the quality you expect from the name do not reveal the true quality of the camera. You would be much better off buying a lumix fz18 for less money and better quality. I definately do not recommend this camera to anyone, I personally sent it back and bought the lumix.

Do not be fooled by the 18x zoom advertisement.  While the zoom is probably it's only good quality, my Sony H5 with a 12x zoom captures basically the same 'distance' zoom, but with much better clarity and crispness.  The flash on the Nikon is horribly designed with a push button release, the time between shots is a little long in my opinion, the movie mode is a total joke!  30 seconds of video at the highest setting is a big upset--very very disappointed in this camera.  The photo quality is very grainy and almost upsetting to my stomach!  Even with ISO set as low as possible, the 'grain' seems to be there for the long run.  I took several indoor photos, several outdoor photos, several zoom photos....just very very disappointed in this camera as a whole.  I suppose if you are only taking pictures of rocks and flowers, then this camera may be ok for you--but then again, so would a cheap disposable camera from your local drug store.  Don't take a chance losing your precious memories to this 'cheap' camera.  I was looking for a higher zoom to replace my Sony, but after seeing the Nikon's poor capabilities, I will stick with Sony from now on.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Price fallen immediately after purchasing the product", "Author": "Jeevan Joseph", "ReviewID": "R3PPC6P3EXJX0R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for $299 during Thanksgiving holidays. but i observed that its price fall to $230 now.
