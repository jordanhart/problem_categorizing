I've read lots of reviews on all brands of cameras where reviewers complained that the lens gets stuck while sticking half-way out.  This is something I don't have to worry about with the S9.I also like that it's durable.  It's not made of plastic, it's very solid.  I actually feel like I got what I paid for.Picture quality is good.  You need to hold the camera VERY still while shooting, since pictures tend to blur easily.  I've been fooling around with it a lot, and I seem to be improving with my shots (where blur is concerned).I also haven't experienced any red-eye!  Woohoo!  They red-eye reduction flash feature really works (so far)!Pictures could be a little sharper, but the camera comes with a CD that allows you to edit the pictures on your computer, and change the brightness, sharpness, color, etc., of the pictures, and you can also rotate them.  This is a plus for me.The buttons are small, but there are very few of them, which makes it simple to use.CONS:Well, I gave this camera only 4 stars PRIMARILY because I bought it from Amazon for $249.99, and then about a week later the price was down to $222.94.  I pre-ordered the camera.  So 1 lesson I learned was: WAIT UNTIL THE CAMERA IS IN STOCK (AND NOT ON PRE-ORDER).  DON'T BUY A CAMERA WHEN IT IS FIRST RELEASED, WAIT A COUPLE OF WEEKS, CHANCES ARE THE PRICE WILL DROP.  I'M SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS!Another con:  You really need to play around with the camera if you want good pictures-- especilly where lighting is concerned.  It's not a point-and-shoot camera-- for me, at least.  The settings are definitely there for a reason (like the scenes, such as indoor, beach/snow, sunset, dusk/dawn, and so on . . . and the flash features as well).Haven't tried the video or voice recording yet, so I can't really comment on that.That's about it.  In all, I don't regret buying it.  Only had it for a few days and I'm liking it more and more (I was a bit intimidated and frustrated in the beginning while trying to find settings that would help me take a good picture).", "Date": "October 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not as good as Canon", "Author": "William Levin \"macboy.com\"", "ReviewID": "R25NYPBLQ4ERYE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the Nikon Coolpix S9 as a replacement for my Canon PowerShot S410 because I wanted a lighter, less bulky ultra-compact camera with good picture quality.  The S9 was the one of the lightest, and earlier versions of the Coolpix family received decent reviews.While the camera is light and fits nicely in my pocket, I must say I was not pleased with the quality of the photos I took with the Nikon Coolpix S9.  Most photos taken with flash in dark rooms came out blurry and washed out white, and often had lens flare.  And photos taken with flash off did not come out as clear as they did with the Canon S410.  Photos in normal lighting with flash on came out okay, but still did not match the quality of the Canon.I'm returning the Nikon Coolpix to Amazon today and purchasing a Canon.", "Date": "November 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "I hate this camera", "Author": "Crazy at the Beach", "ReviewID": "R21DYF8IRRKYRG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it.

It is a pain to have to fix the red-eye manually in Photoshop, but at the same time I don't want to lug around (or learn how to use) an SLR type camera. I thought the Coolpix S9 would be the solution to my problems. While the photos are very crisp and clear, the red-eye is worse than in my old Casio digital camera and the flash really washes out indoor photos taken at night. In fact the flash is so bright it makes my son turn away from the camera, so the pictures that didn't have red-eye were all of the back of his head!

I love the size of this S9 - easy to pack into a purse or pocket and I found it to be fairly intuitive to use.  I love these smaller point and shoot digital cameras since I like to carry one around at all times in case some interesting photo op comes along.  I was able to take some absolutely beautiful close up photos of flowers, etc. with bright color and a sharp image.  However, I found the flash to be very weak and any picture of a moving object that required a flash turned out blurry and dark. I also found this type of zoom lens to be somewhat limiting.  But I have to say the thing that has really turned me off the Coolpix line is that after a little over a year of use, this camera just died.  A pop/snap sound, black screen, and that was it.  I have since replaced it with a Canon which I am very happy with so far - the photos are beautiful, the camera feels solid, and there are terrific features.

However after taking few images in full sun I was pleased with image quality taking into account small lens and price of the camera (I paid $56 for refurbished one with 90 day Nikon warranty). All pictures came out sharp with true colors. I did not see single one that was blurred. Macro worked fine too. In low light condition story is a little different. It appears that flash fires always with the same power so you need to keep approximately 5\" to 6\" from the subject all the time to avoid under or overexposed pictures. I got better results (in low light condition) using museum mode (BSS is on). There are lots of things I like about this camera: size, metal body, lens built inside, nice features like 4 assists modes, 15 scene modes, D-lighting, picture editing, voice recording, date imprint, color options, excellent movie modes and many, many more. Everything works as it should (I checked them all). It is easy to use without reading manual (may be to me becasue I own Coolpix 5700). I could wish only for manual mode. I read a lot of complaints about blurry pictures, noise etc. One can set ISO to low value and use tripod to get good pictures. Do not expect that tiny lens to pass enough light so camera sets low ISO and short exposure time avoiding blurry/noisy pictures. I do not think that you can show me better camera in that size and in this price. There is really nothing not to like about this camera, you just need to read manual and experiment with settings to get good results.", "Date": "August 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "quit after 1 year", "Author": "Donald Wilson", "ReviewID": "R2KLIJAYIND63", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the Coolpix S9 in March of 2007--it lasted until June 2008.

Unfortunately, I have discovered the bright color and design of the camera are the only positive things about this camera. The LCD screen scratches easily but the functions of the camera are the worst. The red eye reduction is inconsistent, the picture quality is low for night shots even when set to the correct setting, and the camera takes very blurry pictures--even when the focusing feature is on. I have learned over time to deal with this camera and how to take more focused pictures, but this becomes a problem whenever you have group shots and someone else is taking pictures--they always come out blurry! Therefore, I do not believe this is a user-friendly camera and there are much higher quality cameras compared to this one (such as Canon) available at similar prices.

L. Moore", "ReviewID": "R1HIBJHWD5HD15", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera several months ago, and I had long been debating between the Canon SD630 and this one. I should have stuck with my first impression and gotten the SD630, as I know Canon's quality. I am not a professional photographer, but I do know a thing or two about photography, and I definitely know enough about technology to make this review credible.The S9 has quite a few problems that I haven't been able to come to terms with:1) Tons of white spots.  - I hate using the flash on this camera for any reason at all, as it always seems to result in white spots in my picture. Too difficult to remove in Lightroom, and it's very frustrating.2) Poor menu layout. - It is such a hassle to switch from auto mode to a scene mode, then having to select one of the scene modes, and then a sub-scene mode (as seen in the Portrait menu). By the time you get it all straightened out, your shot is gone. Again, very frustrating.3) Digital zoom only available in auto mode. - Can't use it in scene modes. Odd.4) Terrible load and storage time. - Sometimes the lag between taking my shot, and being able to take another is up to 15 seconds. I have a very fast storage card, so I know that's not the problem. Once again, I usually miss the next shot while watching the red light flash while storing my pic.5) Colors. - The colors in the photos from this camera are never, ever as vibrant or accurate as those from a Canon. My photos tend to look washed out when photographing people. Granted, there are few times that the pics do look quite impressive, the times that it looks terrible far outweigh the good.This camera is small, lightweight, and really quite durable (as I've already dropped it several times, and it still looks brand new). It would function perfectly for someone just looking to capture moments outdoors, or with ample natural light. Even then though, it is very hard to hold this camera steady enough to not cause a blur. The S9 would be great for teenagers or moms on the go who just need a camera to snap quick shots, and can take a beating.Overall, I'm not too thrilled with the results from this camera, and I will soon be purchasing the Canon SD630 after all. If you are looking for color accuracy and semi-professional photo quality, I suggest you look elsewhere. For a standard point and shoot, the CoolPix S9 might be great for you.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Look some where else", "Author": "oceans", "ReviewID": "R6JNFLPIBSY56", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this little guy a day before a vacation.  I didn't have much time to look for cameras so I got this because I heard Nikons are pretty good. Pros: -SD card - My laptop has a built in SD slot so I loved this -easy to use with one hand -Big screen -pretty fast picture storage (between shots) -3X optical zoom (pretty good) -good battery life (at least 2 days of picture taking, 80 shots, on one charge) -good Mega pixels (after awhile mega pixels don't mean much) -good price as a clearance item at Target (~$160) Cons- -The lack of manual adjustment is a real pain. you have to trick the camera into focusing on the right thing (center the object to focus on then half press the span button so it focuses then re-center on the scene you want). The auto focus is pretty decent.  You have a few modes to play with but using these modes is almost as complicated as adjusting stuff yourself.- The flash is too bright at night (washes out people's faces) and it's to dark in half light situations. This is the biggest problem. There is an option to use D-lighting once the picture is taken however this produces some bad color distortions.Basically I would suggest not getting this guy even at $160 there are much better options", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "s9 nikon", "Author": "Jay Philip M.
