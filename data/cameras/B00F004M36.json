Kuo \"Pretty Cool\"", "ReviewID": "RLCN4PAQ6PNFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not really into the live-streaming deal, but I was looking for a wearable camera like the go-pro, and this camera fit the description perfectly. There are lots of different accessories (for bike handles, helmets, etc) packed into this one, I only wished that it had come with an underwater housing as well.There's also an accompanying Looxcie app for your phone/tablet too. My guess is that it works along with the camera for the live broadcasts but I didn't want to set up another account. But you dont' have to sign up to see some of the videos other are sharing. It's a lot of short quick clips, mostly (all?) unedited. It's actually kind of a charming alternative to youtube.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "So easy to use", "Author": "cintikath", "ReviewID": "RHMUK3QCL765K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

Both are great and the pay off for the slightly larger HD model is the on-board WIFI. Connects to phones and PCs as well as group POV Point Of View. HD quality is nice bonus over the LX1 too.

LOTS of work.  The user manual is a study in gettng users completely irritated by not answering questions and handing the user off to other places for answers instead of providing the answers on the spot.We have gotten on board much more complicated devices than this with a tenth of the effort in way less time..The packaging is overly complicated and totally non intuitive.Too bad because the concept is OK and the construction almost makes it.  Now if we can  figure out how to reset the resolution.
