I since replaced it with a Samsung 4 channel DVR box which does a much better job, and is not as slow as this unit, but the DVR box requires an external VGA monitor.  This system can double as a 1024 x 768 VGA monitor, which is handy, but you cannot view the CCTV using a MAC or an iPhone.  The DVR I bought has a much more granular setting for the motion detection and this system uses very large \"blocks\" of the screen.  For about $500.00 I guess it's a good deal given that each camera would cost about $100.00 or more even from eBay.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Please check internet for problems with is unit", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "R2IQVTX3O2RIUS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will agree with schnick's review. My system is 17 months old and the inverter to the unit went out. After looking on internet, found forums with other buyers who have had the same problem. The screen will only stay on for about a second and then goes completely black. Going by repairmen on the net, the inverter or power supply has gone out. Going to a black screen is some type of safety feature to protect the video. Be aware and do not buy this unit and also think Samsung has discontinued this model for not on their homepage.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "short lifespan", "Author": "schnick", "ReviewID": "R3ID349M9PF7NB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this unit for about 3 years and about 1 year ago all the capacitors blew out in the power source, looking on youtube for a fix I found out that there is a class action lawsuit against samsung over this very same problem whith a large number of their tv's.I took my smt-190 to my local tv repair shop where they replaced the 5 capacitors that had blown and they told me that the cap's were not large enough for the load and put in the next size up in. So everything is working good until the screen goes black about 1 year after the first fix.I contacted samsung to look for a possible solution to the black screen.This was their reply to me.Your SMT-190DN's inverter (back light that displays the screen) is in the process of going out and will need to be replaced. Please contact live support for repair setup 877.349.3149. Thank you.I think a 600+ dollar 19\" screen should last longer than three years!I DON'T PLAN ON EVER BUYING ANOTER SAMSUNG PRODUCT EVER AGAIN!It's over $100 for the inverter plus labour plus shipping both ways.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great System", "Author": "Norman L. Chandler \"Norman\"", "ReviewID": "R2OEHX2QBJJXFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this SMT 190DN security system to replace an older Samsung system that did not have internet capability.  The first thing that one notices is that both systems use the modular RJ11 jacks which makes installing the cameras a breeze.  The next great attribute is the beautiful bright picture on the monitor and the flexibility of the different settings.  I also had my unit connected to the internet for remote observation.  That, unfortunately, required an electrician to \"hard wire\" CAT 5 cable from the unit (which is in the kitchen) to the modem (which is in the family room). (I was hoping that I could establish a wireless connection between the two units but it was too complicated.  The technical support from Samsung was very gracious in working with me in making sure that all of the settings were correct on the unit and with the connection.  The result was a wonderful picture which in fact can be monitored over the internet.  Also, the DVR records all channels individually so that one can look at each channel separately either live or during playback.Overall, I would certainly recommend this unit to anyone interested in installing video survellience while on a budget.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Screen goes black and only turns on for a second when screen saver button is pushed.", "Author": "Luis Galano", "ReviewID": "R1UQ2AKQKBVT5T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This seems to be a pretty common problem with this unit. I should have done a proper research prior to my purchase, I did not buy from Amazon just to clarify.  I bought it at S##'s Club for $899 in 2011 it only lasted less than three years and yes I did not buy the five year ext warranty. The screen only comes on for a few seconds when the screen saver button is pushed.  The research for the fix has not been succesful, ? Need to change an inverter board or a number of capacitors more than likely will require professional repair. Do a search on this monitor and you will see the problems.BUYER BEWARE!!! And if you do buy it get the longest ext warranty possible it will certainly be worth it. Aside from that when it was working it worked like a charm.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible Purchase", "Author": "G. S.

We have not yet installed the cameras that came with this system, but the cameras we had already installed plugged into the replacement unit and came up without a hitch. Only complaint is that some controls are only on the remote and because different people occupy the workspace at various times, we fear the remote could disappear too easily, so we keep it secured. Old system did not record, this system does, but we have not yet used recording features. We watch it periodically during the day, but it does not get activity at night.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0018AUSBC"}}
