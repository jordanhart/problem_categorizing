There is some hiss onthe audio unless you have plenty of input volume.", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "I do not feel cheated like me", "Author": "Moises Alexis Ramirez Arias", "ReviewID": "R34PRB8G90AK3R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I feel cheated with this product is the worst eh could not even use it for the bad result that gave me the test.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Little Camera", "Author": "Estil Parks Jr. \"Web Developer, Amazon Pro Me...", "ReviewID": "R1K5P0KW7WNC1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking to become a movie director then this camera will be a serious disappointment, but if you want a small lightweight camera with an LCD display to capture shorter home movies, little kid's birthday parties and that sort of thing then this camera is a great cost effective solution.You'll need to make sure there's plenty of light or you won't get a good picture. On the other hand it does well in bright sunlight when other similar cameras would fail.With the cheap price in mind, this camera is a great value. You can get it for the same price that many digital cameras (that don't do video) go for.Back to product page", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "five stars", "Author": "xyz123", "ReviewID": "R2AALN7HYB0DTC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "not bad for short videos while wearing it on pants belt carrier,to catch salesman lies, bank rep lies ,inappropiate cop stop and search incidents,neighbors stealing ur stuff etc.\\\\", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000N5YDV4"}}
