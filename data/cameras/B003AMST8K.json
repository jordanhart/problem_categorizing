To generalize, I find them like an old person---rich in capability but somewhat slow and cantankerous to live with.  I rail at my Sigmas but miss them when I leave them home.In any case, I purchased this SD15 to replace my SD14 which had white balance issues that I was tired of dealing with.  This slightly refreshed version is vastly better at analyzing light and properly rendering it.  Other improvements include better burst rates, improved processing engine, SD storage of images, and(importantly) a much cleaner user interface than presented on the SD14.Other comparably priced cameras are faster and more pixel-dense, yet I have found no substitute for the anticipation I feel when processing Sigma photos---they aren't just records of images but, often, impressive interpretations of them.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best, if you're willing to work for it", "Author": "Thomas J. Schum", "ReviewID": "R30A1NRP479607", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my copy of the SD-15 in July 2010 after waiting for it for 2 months.  It came with over 1000 shots already in the shot counter, but with a new camera warranty from Sigma USA.  Don't settle for anything less than a totally \"legitimate\" purchase from a real dealer.  I didn't: the Sigma USA warranty was the important thing.  When I got it, I also got a Sigma 50-200 F4-5.6 OS lens for what I thought was a too-cheap price of $169.  What an excellent combination this turned out to be!I was really waiting for the Sigma 17-50mm F2.8 OS lens, but did not receive it until the end of December 2010 (Sigma-mount availability issues).  Because of focus problems I ended up sending both camera and lens into Sigma USA service for (I guess you could call it) lens calibration (they had it back to me in a week).  No such issue with the 50-200 F4-5.6 OS lens though, it was perfect from the beginning.  After Sigma makes any lens for everybody else they make it available for Sigma cameras, so you need to cultivate a little patience (well worth the waiting).  Go with OS (optically stabilized) lenses if you shoot in less-than-daylight conditions, since the SD-15 image quality does not hold up at speeds higher than ISO 400.  My next (and possibly last) lens will be the Sigma 85mm F1.4 (I'm simply running out of money).If you are willing to shoot raw (don't use the in-camera JPEG) and process the images with Sigma Photo Professional (free download from Sigma), you can get stunning results!  I was not surprised by this because I started out with a Sigma DP2, which in my opinion is equally capable in the image quality area except it does not have an interchangeable lens.  You also have to be willing to \"fiddle\" with either camera to coax out of it the best exposure, focus, and so on.  Since I am a hobbyist and I enjoy this sort of \"fiddling\" I am very happy with my SD-15.  The quality of the images makes it all worthwhile.Sigma won the megapixel wars by making a better pixel.  The images resize very well to 4x JPEGs in Sigma Photo Professional (sigma calls it 2x) because there is very little (if any) visual chaff in the basic images.  I've had 18x24 posters printed and there is plenty of detail along with the excellent colors.  By the way, Popular Photography Magazine reported a test result of Excellent for color accuracy, in its SD-15 lab test of January 2011.You might want to wait for the Sigma SD1 if you regularly print larger than 18x24...", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "You cannot beat the Foveon X3 sensor.", "Author": "Whatever", "ReviewID": "R15IAV302IBIEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The people who say this is not a real 14 megapixel camera don't understand how Foveon sensors work. A picture is not just a bunch of dots (pixels), it is a combination of colors and their intensity.  While a Canon camera might make JPG files that technically have more megapixels than a Sigma, the amount of color information in the Sigma picture is still better.  Also if you think 2640x1760 resolution is somehow not good enough for full size prints then you're on crack. I can't wait for the Sigma SD1 when it comes out.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great images with rich colors", "Author": "Peter \"Peter\"", "ReviewID": "RBD1NGQC3DK0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own this camera for 2 months now. The special Foveon RGB sensor without low-pass filter captures sharp images with beautiful tones and accurate colors.I bought it to replace my 35mm film camera and I am very satisfied. If this camera didn't exist, I would not have gone digital. I can highly recommend this product.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "The SD15 will teach you a few things about photography.", "Author": "BSI Eric", "ReviewID": "R32QLVG1F9BMXJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have gained the most from this camera in the form of education. I am a beginner in digital photography. I didn't know much about shutter speed, etc... I had to learn these things to get images from this camera. I am satisfied with the results I get and the more I learn about photography the better my images get. I really enjoy using the EF 610 DG Super Flash also. It is a must have if you ask me.  There are more automatic cameras out there and they will give you great images, but to me it makes you reliant on the camera's auto functions.If those cameras are not programmed for certain functions than you will not be able to capture images they are not programmed for with them. I also believe that cameras like the Sony A55 SLT, which I owned before the SD15, are more point and shoots than they are DSLRs. I say this because in the end there really is no feature they offer than point and shoots except for interchangeable lenses. Speaking of lenses with sigma you get the best price for quality in lenses. Even the kit lenses with Sigma are great lenses.  I would recommend the SD15 to anyone who would like to improve their photography skills, is making the switch from Joe to pro, is used to shooting with film an wants to switch to digital. The camera is a true 14MP camera but every pro will tell you that Mega Pixels are not the most important thing from the camera. This is true and in my opinion something to be debated over with engineers and not photographers.P.S.Sorry for the long post. I really like the camera.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Product of the future . . . but not of the present!", "Author": "cameratic", "ReviewID": "RAH0BU9FAQMGD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The sigma camera line is built around a sensor, the Foveon, that is technically different from any other.Since it comes closest to film in registering color, it produces images with drop-dead gorgeous color range and detail. Color is more true to life, and required virtually no post editing. The problem is that the image size itself. When it comes to enlargements later you'll discover that your pictures are less than 5 megapixels each-- very small files.  This translates into postcard size prints.  The \"14 meg image\" that Sigma markets refers to the fact that each pixel can register ALL three basic colors, red, blue, and green (which requires three pixels on ither systems). However the number of these pixels is less than 5 million, so images are too small for larger prints or even significant cropping.I sadly had to return my Sigma after discovering this fact, while on trip for which I had specifically purchased the camera. I reverted to film temporarily.  That being said, if you are happy posting to the web or just need small prints, Sigma is unmatched. My one criticism of Sigma is that they do not spell this out clearly in their literature.  There is some good news though, a 46 megapixel version of the 15 is due early in 2011, and this will have a 14-15 meg sensor (in terms of resolution).  This camera  should be a remarkable product if you can wait.Finally, because sigma is not widely used and Foveon is not based on the so-called Bayer filter technology used by every other camera company, some programs like Apple Aperture do not support RAW image files downloaded from the camera--however I found the supplied software more than adequate, and no color modification was even required on the native files.Hope this helps, Eric", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003AMST8K"}}
