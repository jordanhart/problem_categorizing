It has everything a good camera should have in a very compact size. The Fujinon 24~360mm zoom is a superb quality lens. The new CMOS 16mpx back-lighted sensor (same Fuji hexagonal pixels technology) is very sharp and works pretty well in many different light levels. As a more than 3 decades professional photographer, I can tell, compared to this little wonder, my 5DMKII seems as an \"old\" film camera. Its amazing how many functions and presets you have in this tinny camera. It has a beautiful design, great LCD resolution, small enough to keep in your pocket. Its my everytime companion, every new file it amazes me by its image quality. Besides all that qualities it does stunning 1080p movies with stereo sound as well So, as you see I'm in love with this pretty japanese. I strongly recommended it.Fujifilm FinePix F500EXR 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Fujinon 15x Super Wide Angle Zoom Lens", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "Joel \"Casual but critical\"", "ReviewID": "R28MOA8GTYCC2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's not perfect: I would have given 4-1/2 stars, based on my expectations.I've had this camera about 6 weeks and have take a few hundred shots. I've viewed on the camera and two computer screens, but not made any prints yet. I bought it even having read the negative reviews here, because of the positive things I have also read here and elsewhere. Thanks to those who gave the positive reviews.So far I'm very happy with the choice, and mystified by the negative comments about image quality. Also, some of the descriptions of operation don't quite match my camera. Here's one thought: firmware version. On Fuji's web site is the latest firmware, which was 1.13 when I checked. My camera had 1.13 at purchase. If you have earlier firmware you might want to consider upgrading, if the idea of loading new firmware doesn't put you off. Instructions are given on the web site. You can check your current version by holding down the back button while turning on the power. (Sadly, there's no way to know what version will come on a camera you get in the mail.)Based on a reviewer's suggestion, I've always used the camera in M resolution. I might try higher, but M is plenty for me and I don't really believe the value of \"resolution number\" in relation to image quality. Also, I've use P mode mostly, which works fine. I plan to experiment with the EXR mode to see if it helps or hurts.The lens seems great. I like the long zoom, although you have to have very good light or a tripod when using it, or you will get motion blur. That's just expected (and could explain some of the negative comments). The flash is definitely not very strong, but I don't think it's worse than other similar cameras, and there's no way a flash is going to help when using a long zoom for distant objects.The flash position isn't really a problem for me. It seems to be spring loaded, so I don't think any damage is done by having a finger in the way. You get used to it easily, and I like the positive knowledge that the flash is off when it's pushed down. In theory it ought to reduce red-eye a little by being away from the lens, although in practice I've still gotten some bad red-eye. There's a red-eye reduction feature, but I can't be sure how well it works, and it seems to slow down the shutter release so I stopped using it.The display is pretty bright, but in direct sun is still hard to read. I miss the optical viewfinder of my old camera (which died), but you can hardly find any camera in this class with one.I'm not commenting on video mode, since I've barely used it.If you're considering this camera, you should also look at the very similar F505, which may be a better buy. I'm guessing it's the same mechanically with (slightly) different firmware.Hope this helps someone.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "Mooki \"CyBorge\"", "ReviewID": "R2F6AMFAOUN0D2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, I've used this as a point-and-shoot mainly in EXR and Auto. Image quality is very good. I've taken both indoor and outdoor pics. Cost is good. I got mine for just under 200 and I'm happy. A lot of features plus a solid zoom in a very compact size. Display screen is beautiful (don't set it to power saving mode) The negative reviews here may not be very valid. If you're searching for more features or more control you should expect to pay more and consider DSLR. For a compact this has worked great for me.

I saw one review though that said this camera is not for beginners and that might be true.  It is a little more complicated than my other point and shoots that I've had (I always wind up buying fuji finepix too)but in my honest opinion once you figure out how to use it the picture and video quality is worth the time you'll take tinkering.  Plus there is always the internet.  I find that most questions I have some one has already answered, so google away and enjoy your new camera!", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's so EASY", "Author": "just me...", "ReviewID": "R19GN5KMLWS3WW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it, love it, love it.  I thought it would be difficult to use. I bought it to replace a Kodak P&S; that was old (only 7MP). I used the F500 EXR for the very first time at a Monster Truck show. The pictures were fabulous!! In the EXR mode, it worked perfectly. Video's were also easy to start recording and very clear! I am anxious to play with some of the other modes, especially the panoramic (looks cool and easy).  I also liked the battery life.  It worked all day and into the night without needing to be recharged.  The camera is lightweight, and the only thing I don't like about it, is the pop up flash, because that is where my finger keeps trying to hold the camera. Love it, it is now in my purse so that I can take it everywhere I go.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures...really iffy video", "Author": "Urubloom", "ReviewID": "R9X2IDWRD9UWR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I will admit that I was not too happy with this camera at first. But after reading the manual and learning how to use it, it actually takes some really incredible pictures. So unless you are a little more experienced with these types of cameras, or unless you do your homework, you might not like this camera. Once you get past how to use it though it will take some amazing pictures, especially in low light. Now, for the video. The video is really bad in low light conditions. Don't understand why, but it is. Yes it's 1080p but the colors are so dark that when filming in low light conditions you will barely be able to see the picture on the camera. It's even darker when transferring it to your computer. Not sure why.Summary: Excellent camera both indoors and outdoors, once you learn how to use it. I give it 5 stars for pictures. Horrible for indoor video. Outdoor video seems pretty good. I give it 2 stars for video.I'll probably keep the camera because the pictures are so good and I already have a camcorder for recording videos", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "a very good buy", "Author": "Mrs. Elaine McAllister", "ReviewID": "R337CPPPAADTAL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this while on holiday choosing next day delivery.... it was a fantastic buy.

The shutter has jammed twice now. I thought it would be under warranty the first time. But it wasn't they said I jammed it and it would not be covered. I spent $90 to have it repaired and less than a month later the same problem has happened. I'm extremely disappointed in this camera. I had a different fuji camera and it was great but the shutter design on this camera is very poor and their customer service has been horrible. I am never going to buy another fuji camera again.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera/Sensor, but crippled firmware, try the F505 instead", "Author": "AaronAbasolo", "ReviewID": "RQEU7Q0SW884O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have tried out both the F500 and F505, and the F505 currently costs much less on Amazon (~149usd for F505, vs. ~190usd for F500).That said, now to compare them.  Both the F500 and F505 have the same excellent Fuji EXR CMOS sensor, but the F500 (the base model for USA) comes with \"crippled\" firmware; you lose RAW image capture capability, and the horizontal 360\u00b0 panorama size is reduced from 1080 pixels high to only 720 pixels.  You also lose several other \"best shot\" functions with the F500, so why not consider the F505 Fujifilm FinePix F505 16 MP CMOS Sensor and 15x Optical Zoom Digital Camera with 4 GB Class 10 SD Memory Card  (Black) instead; it is not only (currently) cheaper than the F500, but has all the features of the F550 that that the F500 leaves out, except for the GPS geotagging function.  Look at the manual on Fuji's web site (the F500, 505, and 550 all use the same manual).  GPS is a nice feature, but camera GPSs generally are slow to get a fix, and may geotag your picture with a location hundreds of miles away if you have not gotten a fix since you got on an airplane, for example.  If you really want the GPS feature, get the F550 or one of the newer models (F600 / F700 series), they all use the same sensor, but cost more.The image quality is excellent on this and all Fuji models that use the 16MP EXR CMOS sensor (F500, F505, F550, F600/700 series, HS20EXR etc).  I also have a Panasonic DMC-ZS10, and the Fuji is almost as quiet (image noise) at ISO 1600 as the Panasonic is at ISO 400!  Of course, that's using the Signal-to-Noise-EXR mode, which reduces the output to 8MP, but overall the Fuji is much better in low light, producing brighter (more well exposed) images, with lower noise.  Naturally, just about any DSLR will beat it, but among compact models, it's very good.One annoyance is the flash always pops up when you turn it on; you can either push it down or select no flash to disable it, but if you push it down you either have to cycle the camera power, or pull it up with a fingernail to pop it up for use again.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera, no accessories yet", "Author": "Keith", "ReviewID": "RF43J47FETOSQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera if you don't have the money for a DSLR.  Ease of use is top notch, takes great pictures in all conditions, and has a great auto mode.  But what doesn't come in the box is a way to charge it, while the battery is inside the camera.  Meaning you take the battery out, place it in the AC charger, plug up to wall outlet.  It comes with a USB cable, that plugs directly to the camera, but it's for photo transfer only (will not charge over that usb cable).Recommend waiting a bit longer to buy for others until all the accessories come out.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not worth the price paid", "Author": "Keith E.

Some are fantastic, some are pretty diabolical. Images of my dog, taken in the garden on an overcast but fairly bright day, look like they have been through a Photoshop \"Oil Painting\" filter and yet pictures of flowers taken a minute before are crystal clear and full of true-to-life colour. I will post a picture of a corner of one of the \"oil painting\" disasters if I remember. I guess next I will try it in the Auto or Manual modes to see if that improves the image quality reliability. Focus at max zoom has been a bit random too.I've had Fujis before so I'm fairly used to the menu system and control knobs, wheels & buttons. The pop-up flash is annoying but can be easily be \"popped down\" again, whilst staying just open so you can lift it up again if required. Mine is red (and we all know colour is important!) and looks and feels like a class piece of kit. The screen is large but not great in daylight - even on an overcast day I had trouble seeing anything but my face reflected in the screen!So all-in-all I have mixed feelings about this camera. It's not the \"point and shoot and you will have fantastic photos\" camera that I was expecting from some reviews, but I'm willing to stick with it and see if I can manage to get the best out of it eventually. Of course, it could be that I've received a duff camera, but I guess I'll find that out during my experimenting. I really wanted to give the camera a 3.5 star rating but as there are no half stars, I've decided to be generous.

One more thing, the Fuji's flash was very weak almost always guaranteeing an underexposed image. Maybe it just tries to supplement the ambient light, but there is no way to do EV compensation with the flash.I don't know if the F550 or F600's jpeg engine is any better.This would have been a pretty good P&S; had the image quality been better.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Big Disappointment", "Author": "K.

These choices were selected after reading reviews declaring each a top camera in the Travel Camera category. Prices ranged from $199 to $249. Function aside I was firstly interested in the picture quality. After taking hundreds of side by side pictures of various subjects, activities and scenes using multiple settings, I was unable to get any of the cameras to match the quality of the Kodak pictures. The Panasonic was unable to focus a landscape and has contrast issues. The Fujifilm fuzzed the edges at any zoom. The Sony Cybershot got returned due to inaccurate color before 100 photos. I don't think the bulky Nikon is comparable in this group other than in its pricing. As for Function, I disagree with reviewers who rave about AAA rechargable batteries, good luck keeping them organized in your gadget bag. Used in the Nikon, they fell out every time I removed the SD card. Stick with the proprietary battery, and just remember to charge it, just like your cellphone. Of the samples, the functionality of the Panasonic Lumix was tops for me. The Fujifilm Finepix put the pop-up flash on the top left exactly where I hold the camera with my left hand. Sony Logic wasn't for me. So, for now, I'm waiting for Kodak to update their product.
