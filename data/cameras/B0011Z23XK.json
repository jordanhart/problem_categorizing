{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent \"budget\" camera with great features", "Author": "Hyun Yu", "ReviewID": "R2UZODH7CCC3AI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting something like the Canon PowerShot A series camera for a while.  Another hobby of mine involves photographing small objects in a mini-studio settings (not unlike jewel photography, but less demanding/sophisticated).  I wanted something that:- has aperture/shutter priority modes, and manual mode;- can set custom white balance- shows live histogram in recording mode.The Canon PowerShot A720IS and A570IS looked great, but neither had all three features I wanted.  A query here on a photography forum last month led to a reply that pointed me to the then-just-announced Panasonic DMC-LZ8.  On paper, it looked GREAT:  All the features I wanted, 2.5\" LCD with 230K pixels (the Canon ones, while having large screens, have low pixel counts), and priced well under $200 to boot.  It seemed so perfect that I preordered it, which I normally don't do--I usually prefer the manufacturers to go through a few production batches and iron out all the bugs before buying a camera.The camera came today from Amazon.com, and I had a chance to take a few quick shots and get an initial feel for the camera.  Here are my observation and thoughts.  I also have the DMC-FX33, so a bit of the review will be comparing the two.  Not that they are in the same category, but the FX33 represents last year's Panasonic design trends and philosophies, and LZ8 this year's, so I thought it'd be interesting to note the contrasts.The camera feels GREAT in my hand.  I'm 6' tall and have I guess about average hand-size for my height, and the protruding grip felt very comfortable.  The thumb naturally rests right above the Record/Review switch, which provides a nice counter-pressure point to the grip.The LZ8 uses two AA sized batteries and SD/SDHC cards.  The battery compartment and memory compartments are separate, which I like a lot.  The left side of the camera has a door that hides the USB/AV-out port.  There's now a dedicated button near the shutter for Panasonic's Extended Optical Zoom, which allows you to \"zoom\" in further than the 5x optical lens zoom without the traditional degradation in image quality associated with digital zoom.  The flipside is that as you zoom out using Extended Optical Zoom, the image size becomes smaller (at the maximum Extended Optical Zoom, the camera produces 3MP images).Unlike the FX33, the LZ8 does not have a Clipboard mode (at least not that I could find!).  I actually really liked that!  It was an easy way to carry some photos with me and use the camera as a digital photo album.  Not that you can't do that with storing photos on the regular memory card, but the Clipboard mode made it easier.  Oh well.Unlike the FX33, the down button on the four-way controller no longer acts as a quick review button while in recording mode.  But, also unlike the FX33, you can enter the full Review (Playback) mode by using a dedicated switch, rather than having to turn the mode dial to Playback mode.  The Exposure button controls the aperture or shutter or both values, in aperture/shutter priority modes and the manual mode.  The Q. Menu button seems faster (more responsive) to bring up the quick menu than the FX33.The screen menus have changed little other than the background color.  The LZ8 has the same size LCD as the FX33 (2.5\"), but 30K more pixels (230K vs. 200K).  The menu does certainly seem sharper.  A pure eye-candy:  When you shut down the camera, now there's a reflection of the word \"Lumix\" on the screen.A gripe I have with the FX33 was how narrow the viewing angle was for the LCD.  I'm happy to report that the LZ8 is significantly better in this regard.The images straight out of the camera look great.  I know it's a subjective matter, so be sure to check out various review sites and also photo hosting sites that let you view pictures by the camera model to see if you like the image quality.  I've also uploaded some 20 images to accompany this review.So far I'm extremely happy with how the camera feels in my hand, how responsive it is, and how feature-packed it is.  I haven't really tested high ISO performance, as that will not matter in the applications I have for the camera (mini-studio).  I'm sure pixel-peeping the images to death will reveal all manners of shortcomings and imperfections, but for real-world usage, it rates very favorably against the PowerShot series.  Well done Panasonic!", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for the specs", "Author": "Jason Rodgers", "ReviewID": "R2LQ0P0O5CL72N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only owned one other digital camera, a Canon a60.  Although it was only 2mp it took some great photos (still does even after 7,000 shots).  However, I wanted a new one and did research for about 3 months before deciding which one to buy.  I was looking for a pocketable camera that preferably ran off AA's instead of a proprietary li-ion, and could use a SDHC card.  I was also looking for a camera that had a nice wide-angle lens and took true widescreen (16:9) photos - which really narrowed it down.  I really liked the TZ5 w/ the 720p video, but the twice-as-much price and extra heft and battery steered me towards this little guy.  Here are my pro's and con's:Pro's:- 5x optical at full resolution, 8x at 2mp (which still takes decent pics, just not as good as my canon at 2mp). There's also an easy-zoom button that auto zooms to 5x then 8x with just one press each time.  The third press will put back to the wide-angle.- size (very pocketable - much better than my a60 which was pocketed itself for the longest time)- lightweight- Runs off 2 aa's - in fact... I swear I've taken over 800 shots on my new set of Sony Ni-MH's (2600 or 2700 mah), but I'll just have to test that out again in case I did switch them at some point.- Venus IV engine vs the older Venus III for better images- Optical image stabilizer- boot-up time (from off to shot taken)- looks and price (both subjective)- great video (including the ability to do it in 16:9)- As mentioned above - ability to take true 16:9 images (all the way up to 7mp I believe)- full manual control, minus focus (something even the TZ5 doesn't have!)- Easy to use with intelligent auto function that will select the scene mode for you (which has worked really well so far)- 32mm wide angle lens to capture more.  Works great for group photo's or 16:9 outdoors shots.- Leica lens (although that's like saying your speakers or receiver is \"THX certified\" - it's all subjective).Cons:- Slow shot-to-shot when using the flash- photo's don't have the canon color (subjective) - they just seem a bit dull.- blurry shots in low-light condition (more so than my canon a60, but better than my folks' SD400).- More noise than I'd like.  It makes the 8mp necessary if you'll be cropping any of them.All in all I still think this is the best camera you can buy if you're looking for the same specs I was.  I've recommended it to family and friends and even my girlfriend wants one (and she is very careful with big purchases).  One way to tell you got a good deal is that the price actually goes UP 2 months after you bought it (especially if it's anything to do with technology).  I'm actually surprised it's priced so low with it's bigger brother the LZ10 priced a lot more for just a few more bells and whistle's.  If the big optical zoom, wide-angle or 16:9 capabilities aren't necessary than compare image quality to canon's before buying this.  Everyone's opinion on a 'good picture' is different, judge for yourself.  Otherwise, you'll be happy with this purchase just like I am!", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panasonic LZ8 - Excellent Camera", "Author": "J.

I can say without reservation: THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA! I've read 1000s of reviews on digicams on the net, I finally settled on the LZ8 because it had full auto, manual (aperture & shutter), a great 2.5\" screen, nice video capabilities and was under $[...]. Many websites complain about digicam's low light capabilities, given my experience with this camera using it's manual controls and a tripod, frankly I got excellent results.If want to see this camera's capability, then goto: steves-digicams, and under \"Photo Contest\" look at my entry for 20 May 2008.Take it from a user with who can make up his mind without fear of upsetting sponsors etc. There is no problem with start up speed, if there is any lag when taking flash photos, the question is what do u expect? This is an 8M camera using AA batteries. If u want a fast 8M camera using LiOn batteries (that might take faster flash photos) then spend $[...] or more and just u might just get that, or buy a DSLR. The bottomline is: if u want Porsche performance then buy a Porsche.The LZ8 is a honest to excellent $150 camera that will produce great photos and has options that can be only found in more expensive cameras.

After using the camera for several months, I would be willing to sacrifice some image quality for speed. This camera is insufferably slow.

Shoop", "ReviewID": "RVG4KSWBYIO8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a 9 day trip to Costa Rica after analyzing all of the possibilities. I was drawn to Panasonic because I bought my daughter a similar camera a few years ago that takes great pictures of my black pets, which is sometimes very tricky. That camera was no longer available, so I had to research the newer ones.I chose this camera for its size, zoom (I settled for 5x since I didn't want to spend a lot on another camera) and use of AA batteries, which would be easy to find in Costa Rica if the need aroze.The instructions are easy to understand!!!!! You need to read through them, just the basic part, then look up anything else you are interested in as you go along. I didn't get lots of practice before the trip, but have FANTASTIC photos! I took 1,042! I even got good at having the camera ready, and timing when we'd pass something on the road and getting it centered!!! The 5x zoom with the extra boost to 8x did a great job! I was used to a 10x zoom with my older, large camera which I didn't want to fuss with on this trip.My travel companions thought I spent a fortune on such a little camera that could do so much! I took movies or bull riding, a close up of a rattle snake, gorgeous sunset photos, and on and on! I could not be happier and I think anyone could easily use this camera and take professional looking photos.The part you need to know which is hard to find out without digging, is that you need NiMH batteries. I only had to recharge them twice for the almost 4GB of photos I took! Keep a charged set in your camera case, and you'll never miss a shot. Well, I did miss a great shot when my daughter locked us out of our room in the rainforest and on the way I ran into an armadillo on the sidewalk - WITHOUT MY CAMERA!!!!!! We had a great encounter though. He snorted at me and ran away.I am very happy that I chose this camera for my trip of a lifetime in the rainforest, climbing up volcanoes, hiking to hot springs, and riding through the mangroves.

I hate to use flash most of the time as it usually gives a glaring effect (not to mention surprising the subject) and want to capture pictures in natural light as much as possible.  I also tried the Nikon Coolpix ($200) and got the same result, though marginally better than the Canon.  Finally settled on the Lumix which gives fabulous indoor shoots in natural light (while also doing great on outdoor shots).  All the other features (incl manual control) were a great bonus as they usually come in higher end cameras/SLRs.

My 7 year old Cannon S30 got stolen so I was looking for an replacement.  My must have criteria includes: wide angle, compact size, stabilization program & uses AA batteries. Of course I wouldn't mind having manual shutter & aperture control like my S30.  I did a thorough search and there isn't any choice but the Panasonic's LZ8 or LZ10.  The wide angle on my LZ8 is 32mm which isn't that wide as I thought, I should have bought the LZ10 which has 30mm and a bigger sensor.Here is my review(1-5 pts):*Construction: 5 (solid & beautiful esp in black)*Picture Quality: 2.5(average-, not outstanding, except in macro mode which is excellent). My S30 was better*Performance: 1 (very sluggish when using flash; I don't know if AA cameras are all this slow) Also slow start.  However, picture play back is very fast.Pros: *Wider angle  *Manual shutter & Aperture controls  *Solid construction  *Uses AA Long & battery life.  I took 250 pix on my brand new Sony 2700 mah  rechargeable batteries and still have 50% of juice left.  *Excellent LCD--high resolution & brightness.  *5x optical zoom can be boosted to 8x if using 2m  *Very good macro(close up) pictures  *Many scenes/modes to choose fromCons: *Very slow performance esp when using flash  *Picture Quality only average to average minus with higher noise than average. Pictures come out very soft devoit of fine details and with a faded/washed look.  In P mode, I adjusted the contrast & sharpness to help improve this shortcoming. Can see a lot of dust dots reflected on the lense when taking very dark photos.  *Too many restrictions on selection; for exemple, you cannot choose resolution less than 3m when in auto mode etc.I wish the piture quality was better but overall I gave it a 4 because of it's very reasonable price & all the features it possesses like wider angle, compact size, stabilization program ,manual shutter & aperture control & uses AA batteries.

The \"contestants\" were: Canon Powershot A470, Canon Powershot A590 IS, Fujifilm FinePix Z20fd, Kodak Easyshare C1013, Nikon Coolpix L18, Olympus FE-360, Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ8, Samsung L210 and Sony Cybershot DSC-W120.

Full manual controls, aperture priority, shutter priority, tons of scene modes, AA batteries, very good image quality... you get the drift.I recently pitted this camera in my own one-shot group test against four other P&S; cameras: Fuji Finepix 2650, Sony Cybershot DSC W80, Fuji F30 and Panasonic DMC TZ5. I recently took three different shots near the Georgetown C&O; Canal boat in Washington DC on a partly cloudy day around 2:45 PM using each of the above five cameras under similar conditions - low fixed ISO of around 100, outdoors, AWB, partly cloudy day in aperture priority (F/8 for LZ8 and F30, 1/50 and 1/60 sec respectively) or similar mode (landscape for W80 (F/2.8, 1/320 sec), \"manual\" for Fuji Finepix 2650 - F/3.5, 1/180 sec) and auto for TZ5 (F/3.3, 1/200 sec).The TZ5 was clearly a cut above the rest and my old faithful Fuji 2650 is beginning to show its limitations but the other three turned out to be somewhat closer to each other in image quality than I would have imagined, at least under these specific conditions. The \"low light king\" Fuji F30 has the most vivid colors among all the five with the corresponding Finepix color setting of F-Chrome, and is a notch ahead of the Sony DSC W80 and Panasonic Lumix DMC LZ8 in terms of details captured and overall image quality. You can see the results on flickr - just add a slash photos slash sbansban1 after the URL.I have also used the LZ8 for nightshots with and without a tripod, indoors in tungsten light, in macro mode, to shoot fireworks and of course, outside in broad daylight in landscape and other modes including P (Program auto), Aperture priority, Shutter priority and full manual modes. In each situation the camera has performed quite well. If someone wants to nitpick he / she might find the auto white balance without flash under tungsten light giving a yellow color cast but that can be corrected quite easily using the custom white balance or in Photoshop. Also, I did not check the shutter lag etc as I really don't have too many reasons to care about it so you'll have to gather that info from elsewhere. I personally have no complaints whatsoever, except maybe one: It lacks a \"vivid\" color mode that I like to use a lot - in fact almost all the time. So I sometimes have to spend 5/6 minutes to post process certain special images in Adobe Photoshop - under Image->Adjust, turn up the saturation a few notches, adjust the \"levels\" histogram and play with the curves etc. which for me is no big deal.All in all, a great, solid camera.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with camera - Warning on the special...", "Author": "H00D", "ReviewID": "R1PY9NILCU0ZJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think the camera is great, On full auto mode it takes great shots but it also allows manual control of aperture and shutter (most compacts in this price range don't do this).

Kane", "ReviewID": "R10980621I5P31", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When my Canon A710is died, I needed a point-and-shoot that would fit a pocket better, offer similar zoom range, and good battery life... and I needed it quickly. I did some quick research, and had settled on another camera, but came across a deal I couldn't pass up on Amazon. Being short on cash I decided to look into it further. The Lumix rated well on some of the review sites, so I went with it.  For the money, this is a solid performer.First the bad.  It takes very natural pictures in good light, but in lower light the pictures look a little overprocessed by the noise reduction in the camera.  It's also noticeably slower to focus as the light level drops.  It does have a focus assist light, but it seems like the camera first tries to focus without it, then turns it on and tries again.. making focus in poor light annoyingly slow.  The flash is strong, but a little harsh compared to the A710.  Most of this is only visible in side by side comparison to photos from the A710, so unless you blow up your photos and print them, it's really not a problem.  Using the iA mode drastically slows down the performance of the camera.  The idea is good, but with every shot, the camera takes nearly a full second to decide on settings to use for that shot.  In theory that's nice, but I think the camera may have too many choices for it's own good. The flash is also very slow to charge between shots.Now the good.  When you use the other scene modes or manual settings, the performance really speeds up.  It's never what I'd consider a snappy performer, but shot to shot times and shutter release to recorded image times drastically improve.  The display is sharper and brighter than the A710, and the controls are just as intuitive, if a little different (OK, yeah... I'm a Canon fan).  The zoom is relatively fast for a camera in this class, and it has a neat little E.zoom button next to the shutter that very quickly takes you from whatever zoom setting you're currently at to full optical zoom, full optical + digital zoom, and back to wide angle.  I find this feature to be very handy.  The LZ8's wide angle lens is nice, and because of this it's easier to use in small spaces than most other point and shoots I've owned.  It's quick to power on and off, and I found the controls easy to use even with large hands. I also like the fact that the SD card door is separate from the battery door. The face detection is nice, but makes the camera just slightly slower.Battery life in the short time I've had it has been exemplary.  I used up the set that came with the camera the first day I had it, which made me a little nervous, but I immediately switched to the 2300 mAh rechargeables I used in my old camera and performance has been great.  Between experimenting with it the first week I had it, two birthday parties, a weekend at the beach, and day to day use I still haven't drained the second set of batteries yet.. after around 300 photos, many with flash.  I never got more than 200 shots out of the A710, usually somewhere around 80 to 100. Flash recharge time is increasing as the batteries drain, as expected, but is noteworthy on a camera with such a slow recharge time to begin with. Most likely, after I've finished stretching battery life as far as I can, I'll get back into my old habit of swapping in fresh batteries before every event.Overall this camera isn't a great replacement for the A710, but as the 710 was a higher end (and therefore more expensive) camera back when I bought it, it's not completely fair to compare it to the LZ8. Having said that, I did expect the performance of a 4 year newer camera in this class to be slightly better. I bought this camera so I don't have to carry my dSLR around all the time, and for that purpose it's great.  It stays in my work van most of the time, and fits a jacket pocket on a motorcycle ride easily. Battery performance so far is good enough that I would be comfortable not carrying a spare set for a day if the ones in the camera are fairly fresh.. a new experience for me. It's inexpensive enough that I wouldn't get upset if it were to get damaged, but still takes satisfactory pictures. It lost one star for the sluggish performance in iA mode and slightly soft low light images.  The other star was lost for it's slow full shutter press to image taken time. I made the right choice for the money I had to spend at the time, and for about $130 (with overnight shipping) this camera performs well.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Expected Better", "Author": "DB from NC", "ReviewID": "R211O6UJ6B2UBG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We've had two Canon cameras which have taken great pictures, but the first model used a proprietary battery and we had to replace it twice and it was expensive.

Hathaway", "ReviewID": "R36G63F8KDYCTX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Major points:1 In some cases (usually in dark or very dark conditions), the camera produces completely unacceptable results, with small white \"bubbles\" appearing throughout the shot. I have researched this and there are a couple of notes on the web that complain of how the lens may accentuate \"dust dots\". Understand I have verified this on 2 different cameras, sending the first one back the day that I got it, only to have the same thing happen with the second. [This is the only serious negative in the mind of this reviewer, and bubbles will not be an issue in most photos.]2 The general sharpness of the images is noticably inferior to some other point and shoot cameras, such as the Canon SD1000, which I also have. This difference is completely inconsequential for printing 4x6 photos but can easily be seen for example, when displaying at large sizes on a PC. Still, to many people this is probably a non-issue.3 The general layout of controls, menus, etc. is very well done. To me (and this is subjective), it is much better done and more intuitive than what you see on the point and shoot Canon cameras.4 The software with the camera is okay, but I like the Canon software better.5 Panasonic support has sucked in my attempt to get help. I registered my first camera (which I later sent back) online. Later, I filled out a form on the Panasonic site to request help with the bubble issue. It has been eight days since, and I have received no answer from Panasonic. Additionally, the nearest service center to me (Georgia) is Illinois. Luckily, Panasonic devices have good reliability and so you will probably never have to deal with their \"support team\".6 The feature set (zoom, manual options, etc.) is clearly good compared to other cameras in this price range.7 For whatever its worth, I have decided to keep the camera. Honestly I would be very enthusiastic about it if not for the bubble (i.e., dust?) issue.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera better than expected.", "Author": "Deegan Peter \"Deegan\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZHWT9GHIGRBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the LZ8 after casually looking for a p&s; for almost a year.  After reading review after review of other brands I concluded most cameras were sufficient but I wanted a little more and especially wanted a manual mode.I used to do professional work with film cameras so understand what makes a good camera.  I am really pleased with the electronics in this little beauty.  Those that complain about its performance in low light situations should perhaps get a better tripod.  I have had no difficulty with low light and in fact, love the portrait feature at the night mode.  It works perfectly every time.I've had the camera 2 months now and use it almost every day.  I very seldom print out photos so the 8 mp is more than adquate for posting photos on the internet.  Often I use it with the 3 mp option with excellent results.  The Leica lens is as good as I expected it to be and outshines my Fuji that cost almost 3X as much.  The 5 X optical zoom is clean and bright even at the edges.  Have used the camera taking aerial photos with some degree of success but one really needs a larger lens to get detail in aerial photos.  Never the less, it does a more than adquate job if you don't need high detail photos.  Keep in mind this is a low cost camera.  It has facial recognition, stabliaztion plus the needed manual mode for apature and shutter speed over rides..I think that most buyers of this camera would be very pleased with the results they will get with the automatic functions they will use most of the time.  They work perfectly and you can take it out of the box and start shooting if you want.  There is no learning curve.  However if you want to study the instruction book you will get results like a pro just by learning a few of the techniques available on this camera.  Most users will never take the time to learn about the advanced features and will just use the automatic function which will suit them just fine.The only drawback was the lack of an optical viewfinder. While I would have liked to have seen an optical viewfinder, I did find that the LCD screen was bright even in the Arizona sun.  Only on the rare occasion did I find the need to shade the viewfinder to frame my photo.I should mention that after making the decison to purchase this camera I found it on sale at Big Lots for $88.  So I bought 2 cameras and keep one in the car and have one at work a luxury for me since it provides me with a backup camera when I am traveling.I have no doubt it will be outdated in a couple of years but even then, I will have a good camera that will suit my needs for many years to come.Deegan Peter", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "design flaw that isn't covered under warranty.", "Author": "Hervian Rose", "ReviewID": "R3TXI114P86V0S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was at first an OK camera for the price, BUT the screen cracked spontaneously after less than 6 weeks of light use, and neither the seller nor Panasonic would repair, replace or refund it.I searched on line, and found picture after picture of similar cracks on various lower end Lumix cameras, typically starting from the lower half of the right edge of the screen.

It is not always feasible to carry a large DSLR with me. For me the primary criteria of choice was1. It should be cheap. Less than 150$2. It should have as high an optical zoom as possible.3. It should provide as much control on photograph as possible.Panasonic LZ8K satisfied all the above criteria very well. It has 5X zoom and cost lest than 125$. most importantly, it supports aperture priority, shutter priority and fully manual mode along with ability to store 3 custom configurations. All these are accessible through a dial (like in SLRs) so that one doesn't have to use multiple selections on the menu. This kind of control is generally present on only high end pro-sumer camera like canon superzoom range camera that run in range of 400$ +The image quality is awesome, ability to control it ensures that the quality is better than any other point and shoot in the same range.I would highly recommend this camera for someone as a stepping stone to digital photography without spending a huge amount of moolah on the camera.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "very good for the Price", "Author": "Ivan", "ReviewID": "R2WFYE5QO68H7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a balance between Photo quality and better zoom than regular 3X.

I had been told I would receive a replacement within 10 days of their receipt of my unit, but I don't expect to ever receive a thing at this point. My phone calls are met with rudeness and when I ask to speak to a manager I'm informed that they're all \"in a meeting.\" I demanded a new camera be shipped to me and was informed that since my camera hasn't technically been received by them, regardless of tracking information, they will send me nothing.Seriously. Buy nothing from this company. I just ordered a low end Cannon so I won't miss anymore weeks of my 9 month old son's life.", "Date": "February 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "My new camera", "Author": "J.

My sister-in-law has a Panasonic and has taken some really nice photos with it, so I thought I would buy one and try it.  Was I ever disappointed. The time between taking the picture and when the screen comes back up is like 8 seconds. Not good when you are trying to take photos at a wedding. Also there were these little white spots on some of the pictures that I have since found out are dust spots. Also it takes forever to focus in a low light situation. The only good thing I can say about this camera is that it takes really good photos outside in good light. Detail is awesome. However that doesn't make up for what it doesn't do.
