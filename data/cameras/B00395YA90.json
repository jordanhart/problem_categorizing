{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty amazing point-and shoot camera.", "Author": "KHA", "ReviewID": "RSW0I46BH9XN7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this to replace my Canon A1000, which I bought last year for a trip to Rocky Mountain National Park.  Had to really struggle to get a good pic with the Canon -- I was very aggravated with it (though I finally came up with some program combinations that worked okay for the low light under the trees).  But I decided for this summer's trip to the beach to try a new camera, with more zoom, and pass my Canon down to my 12-year-old son -- who's not nearly as picky as I am ;-)Did a bit of research (which is always overwhelming because there's such a huge selection to choose from, and such a diversity of opinions on what makes a \"good\" camera).  And I still wanted a pocket camera for convenience when hiking, fishing, float tripping, etc., so the Canon SX20 and Nikon P100 and the like were still too large for my needs.  And then I came across well over 100 user reviews raving about the Panasonic ZS3 -- the predecessor of the ZS5/7 models -- on various websites, and it's reviews were also very good on \"official\" review sites.  What especially impressed me was a review by a couple who guide trips to Yellowstone, were experienced SLR users, and had tried the ZS3 as a compact alternative -- and they loved it for outdoor shots.  So I decided to try out the newer version of the ZS3, the ZS5.(The main differences I saw between the ZS5 and ZS7 were that the ZS5's screen is 2.7\" instead of 3.0\", the ZS7 has two custom \"My Scene's\" instead of one, the ZS7 has a built-in GPS, and the ZS7 also has stereo video instead of mono, with more advanced video technology.  None of those features were important to me for the additional money.)I've had the camera only a couple of days, and have done various side-by-side camera comparisons between the ZS5 and the Canon A1000, and I'm pretty floored by the capabilities and photo quality of the ZS5.  I'm especially impressed with the macro (I like to take wildflower pics).  While no camera is perfect (from what I've seen), for me the ZS5 is going to be just what I needed for outdoor pictures.  I'll update this review once I've had more time to experiment.Update 05/11/10:  Some cons -- (1) Battery door latch seems a little flimsy; wonder if it will get where it doesn't latch tight after alot of use?  Only time will tell. (Other than that, this camera feels solidly built.)  (2) Proprietary battery that has an ID chip built in, and the software in the camera looks for that (on their website, Panasonic says this change was made to ensure battery quality/safety).  However, it appears you can finally get a 3rd-party battery thru Amazon (meaning a whole lot cheaper), and other vendors -- just be sure to look for \"ID Secured\" batteries (e-mail and ask the vendor first if you're not sure).  I knew this before I bought the camera, but figured it should be pointed out.  (3) I've had several indoor shots, in not very low light, that looked fuzzy, especially when you zoomed in on a PC.  Not always the case, though.  I think the \"iA\" mode is not always as intelligent as it should be.  Also, reducing to 4 stars, so as not to mislead anyone that the camera is \"perfect\" -- though it's still \"pretty amazing\", and I'm really happy with it.Update 05/14/10:  The best pics seem to come with my own settings, and not with the \"iA\" mode where the computer is trying to make all the decisions for me.  So you'll want to learn what the various settings do (and there's quite a few of them -- lots of flexibility).  The ZS5 has three \"Custom\" memory slots in which to save your own configurations (which is great -- my Canon had no memory slots, and I was constantly fiddling with the settings).", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "An astonishingly excellent camera on manual, a mediocre point-and-shoot otherwise.", "Author": "Phalanx", "ReviewID": "R3SUAFKTX4T95S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic Lumix ZS5 a.k.a TZ8 is purportedly a point-and-shoot camera. However, if the auto setting is all you will ever use it on, you'll probably be disappointed by its performance. This is not a camera which you can simply set on auto, aim, click the button and expect the pictures to come out excellent all the time.My experience with the intelligent auto has been hit or miss so far. To be blunt, the 'intelligent auto' does not seem exceedingly intelligent at all, and it loves bumping up the ISO (grainy pictures) and pulling out the flash in circumstances where using the said flash doesn't seem to make much sense (wasting battery and resulting in ugly photos). To be fair, it performs excellently when taking pictures in bright outdoor conditions, but if you plan to take pictures indoor and it is the slightest bit dim, the auto doesn't seem to do too well and I ended up with a lot of blurry photos that way. Even with the flash deployed.After spending about a couple of hours taking a bit of time to understand the manual modes and the appropriate settings of each, however, the mediocre point-and-shoot camera became an excellent little camera. The manual modes allow you a lot more leeway on how you want the photo taken, and thus override the choices the irritating auto mode makes, thus saving your indoor photos. You can also do a lot of experimental pictures. (In fact at the smallest aperture setting, the camera allows you to keep the shutter open for a staggering 60 seconds!). So if you know at least a little bit of basic photography and are willing to do your own settings, the camera manages to perform to its full potential and you can get some truly excellent photos.If you're not too keen on reading up on fstops and shutter speeds and whatnot, I should mention the camera does get along quite respectably on its preset scenery modes. There's a pretty nice selection of them, covering outdoors, night scenes, food shots, macro etc. An important thing about getting good shots while using these modes is to give the IA a lot of time to \"make up its mind\" how it wants to take the photo by halfway depressing the button before you take a photo. Do watch for the indicator on the LCD to turn green before committing the shot. There's also a high-speed burst option, which scales down your pictures to about 4 megapixels but allows to you take a lot of pictures in succession very very quickly. (Note: You can also shortcut to this mode under the MS setting on the mode dial)As you all know, the huge Leica lens on this camera is the main attraction and it lives up to its hype. It's advertised as 16x zoom, but only 12x of it is optical, the rest of it done by \"intelligent zoom\", which is basically a surprisingly almost-indistinguishable-from-optical digital zoom. The zoom also works (limited however) in macro zoom mode, which can result in some amazing macro shots. The camera also has conventional digital zoom (which went up to a staggering 90+ times zoom) , but you have to navigate the camera's controls to turn it on because by default it's turned off. The non-intelligent digital zoom however, does produce grainy pictures, but this is expected of digital zoom anyway.When you have a strong zoom, the image stabilization capabilities of a camera become extremely important, and the ZS5 seems to have that covered. I did some testing shooting out of a moving car, sometimes with maximum optical zoom and the camera managed to deliver surprisingly clear pictures despite that.I actually liked the slightly larger size of the camera, since it made it far easier to hold, but the thing that tipped the balance in this camera's favour for me were the controls, which shy away from pressing buttons as much as possible (Sorry Canon, but you lost out to the Lumix in the end because of this). Dials and switches are less prone to accidental pressings, and a nice little feature is that the camera will still recognize situations where the power switch has been left on by accident and will shut itself down to save the battery.The battery life is ok, but not particularly amazing. I would recommend getting a spare battery to keep on hand. Do keep in mind however the battery is a proprietary Panasonic one, and the firmware on the camera will recognize imitation batteries and refuse to use them.The HD video is very nice, although the sound recording is only in mono. The upshot of this camera is that the zoom can be used with the video, and I was very pleased with that because it really does make a lot of difference when you're taking videos of something far away so that you can actually see the thing instead of it being a black silhouette. It does not use the same recording format as the other cameras in the ZS3 or ZS5 however, so if I am not mistaken, the video recordings will take up more space on your SD card.Overall, I am quite happy with this camera, but like I said before, this camera doesn't do too well as a simple point-and-shoot for the casual user. It takes a while to learn to use to get the best out of it. I would however, recommend this camera for people with a casual interest in photography, and aren't afraid to experiment with their own settings. I would also recommend this camera to people who are into photography but want a compact camera with an excellent zoom without having to lug around a DSLR and lens bag.Pricewise, I think it's quite reasonable, and I don't think you can get another superzoom camera from any other camera maker for this price range. Although if you find a ZS3 (the older higher end model of this same series) for about the same price, you won't lose out by getting the ZS3 either.UPDATE 29 Oct 2011: After a little over a year's use, the genuine Panasonic battery that came with the camera decided to suddenly and completely stop working. As I have mentioned before, replacements are not cheap and 3rd party batteries may be blocked by the camera's firmware, so this is definitely something you may want to consider before making any purchases. Still enjoying the camera, the battery factor could be a bit better...", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sweet li'l pocket cam", "Author": "David Chaika", "ReviewID": "R1TMXPH67Q2Q95", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera two weeks ago and almost immediately took it for a long weekend in the NC mountains, where I shot near 700 photos, including video and some bracketed shots. All outside overcast daytime shots. The camera worked like a charm and is much more convenient than my Canon DSLR and larger Panasonic FZ20. I carried it mostly in my jacket pocket.I have not shot video before, and this one works great! I guess the image stabilization works in video, because mine came out looking pretty smooth, including the zooms, which seem to run a little slower than zooming between still shots. Nice. Sound is good too, I got waterfalls in video and sound.The major prob. with my DSLR is close focus - i.e., none. With this baby you can get down to 3cm. This is real good for wildflower and moss/fern shots. I wish I had brought my 1-ft tripod with me, but still got lots of acceptably sharp shots. Have not printed any blowups to test this yet.Battery life - well I didn't count the shots, but towards evening the alert started flashing at me. Going to buy a second battery, which I would recommend you do, if you want to be sure of a full day's worth of photos. I did a lot of reviewing and zooming in to check that I had things in focus.Great feature of Slide Show viewing -- you get various directional pans of your stills, plus music. Sweet! Wish I could do that on my Windows 7 PC, but I think you can hook up to your TV and get this.Still learning how to use some of the functions. Unfortunately, the printed manual includes only the basic settings, and you have to read the CD manual to find out more details. This is not like the manual for the FZ20. I would like a complete printed manual to peruse.You can set 3 presets, and I tried setting up one. Needed the manual to figure out what all you could do, but I had not brought it with me. That seemed a pretty convenient way to do things and I am going to configure all three settings when I get time.I wonder if there is any way to get the ZS5 to shoot RAW photos like the hack (temporary) for some of the Canon pocket cameras. Think Panasonic will do a firmware update for this?I discovered that the f-stop range is really limited, f/3.3-6.3. You can't get much depth of field when you do closeups. I would say that this is my main issue with this camera, would like to be able to stop way down. But I really like the wiiide angle lens!I was out in rain, and I wish there were some way to put on a lens hood. Had to wipe and blow drops off the lens.I had been worried that my eyes with glasses would not be able to focus on the screen (there is no viewfinder), but then found that you are basically only positioning elements when you make a shot, leaving the focusing to the camera. That worked out great.Remember to take the camera out of Macro mode when you are switching back and forth. I didn't and got a couple of fuzzy shots.The battery door and lock seems weak, and the off/on and wide angle /tele knob are a little too small for me, but I managed ok.One 8GB card, and I used only about 5GB this weekend.

As a still camera, it turns out crazy clear pictures, and the 12x Optical Zoom lens is pretty nuts for this sized camera. I first tried out the Nikon Coolpix S8000, and this thing stomps the Nikon in every way, including the lens. Yes, this 12mp camera turns out better pictures than Nikon's 14mp camera.On top of being a great still camera, this takes GREAT HD video. Super clear, little to no feedback or distortion.Then, if you get into the manual and learn how to really use this camera, there are so many manual adjustments (shutter speed, fstop, etc), it's almost as customizable as an slr camera, save for interchangeable lenses.All in all, this is a great deal, and certainly at the top of the line.", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Camera", "Author": "CTSIA-100", "ReviewID": "RM5SDXWNYCFE9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Lumix ZS5 reminds me of the finer 70's era stereo equipment.  Because of keen competition, the finer stereo equipment was \"over-engineered\" which contributed to it almost immeasurable quality and durability.  Such is the case with the Lumix.  Initially I purchased a comparable Canon, but the articles I read about the Lumix ZS5 were etched in my mind...so I ordered the Lumix.  Out of the box the stellar quality and workmanship was obvious; the clarity of pictures is perhaps unparalleled for cameras in this category; and the ease of operation is wonderful.  The quick start-up time still surprises me and the wide angle Leica lens is remarkable on this camera.  It also the right mix of heft without weight so it's comfortable without feeling like a plastic toy!

It was difficult to use, was slow to take pictures and the quality of the pictures was not that great.  Needless to say, I was hounded for two years to get another one.  So when I finally decided to replace it, I did quite a bit of research on which camera to buy.  Everything I read pointed to this camera and I'm glad that it did.The camera is very well put together.  It feels very solid in your hands but it doesn't feel to heavy.  The lens zooms in and out very quickly and the camera boots up extremely quickly so that you can grab that quick shot.  There are a ton of features which I have yet to use, but fully intend on exploring.  There are tons of pre-set scene modes for shooting as well as alot of manual control features.  It has has an option to record HD video.One of the best features for us was the burst feature.  We have a baby on the way and my wife really wanted a camera which would be able to grab shots of the baby as he moves around.  Our old camera had this feature but it was very slow and the pictures turned out horribly.  This cameras burst feature works amazingly.  It takes what looks like 2-3 pictures a second and they are very clear.Another thing about this camera which is very handy is that it focus's extremely quickly and takes pictures as soon as you hit the button.  Our previous camera would focus ok, but would be very slow to take the pictures.  This new camera will snap a picture as soon as you tell it to and will do it in focus.  It came in extremely handy as we just went on a trip to Savannah and toured the city on a trolley tour.  We were able to get pictures while riding on the tour that we would have never been able to get before.It also has an incredible zoom.  It is quick to zoom and allows  you to capture moments much farther away than most point and shoot cameras.If you are looking for an incredibly easy to use point and shoot camera that will take amazing pictures but also offer plenty of pre-set and manual features, look no further.  I promise you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "PANASONIC ZS5 BEST IN CLASS?", "Author": "D. A. Paulon", "ReviewID": "R2ZLJWGYDFC2BX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The question is whether the Panasonic ZS5 is the best in the 2010 class of point and shoot cameras.  In my humble opinion it is.  All of the reviews written against this camera, for example poor picture quality and not a real 12X Optical Zoom(you've got to be kidding), are simply not true.  Even the favorable reviews are not necessarily true.  I have been taking photos of some kind over 45 years and I have yet to find the \"perfect\" camera.  Of course, I am not a professional, but I feel I am more than just the casual photographer.I have tested the ZS5 camera against an older, but more expensive Casio Exlim 7.2 Megapixels and my Nikon D70.  All of these cameras are very good, but I wanted to take a more versatile camera on our recent trip to Alaska.  The picture quality was just simply outstanding.  Were all of them perfect?  Did all the 500 plus photos turn out with perfect contrast, sharpness, and focus?  No, to both questions.  But taking pictures of Orca whales on the move, which turned out very good, and a still picture over Resurrection Bay are quite different.  The camera performed in excellent fashion when properly used.  For example, in  manual mode it took almost perfect pictures of the moon rising over the mountains on Resurrection Bay and in IA, the camera performed very well in the sunlight over Exit Glacier.  However, you will get washed out colors, especially on white capped mountains when taking the picture into the light. But that is what most any camera would likely do. One review accurately noted that putting the camera in Scene mode would be very beneficial and I agree with this observation.  And of course, Manual, Aperture, and Shutter speed modes are all there to learn and use to take better pictures by anyone.The camera also did an excellent job with the true 12X optical zoom plus the 4X digital.  Excellent quality if one holds the camera still.As other reviews have noted, the ZS5 does an outstanding job taking macro zoom pictures.  Taking video movies with the camera also showed excellent results; just don't move the camera too quickly.I highly recommend the Pansonic ZS5 digital camera as an all around camera.  To those who are still undecided as to which point and shoot camera to buy, you will not be disappointed with the Panasonic ZS5.  For those who have purchased the camera, stay with it.In conclusion, this is still a point and shoot digital camera.  These cameras have come a long way in quality and price reduction.  All of the major companies make great point and shoot cameras, but that is exactly what they are.  These kinds of cameras have a place for good photography but are no match for a digital SLR, but again, when hiking up the Harding Ice Fields near Seward, Alaska, the Panasonic ZS5 was a perfect litte pocket camera to carry.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic ZS5", "Author": "Pixl Junke", "ReviewID": "R1U2H7SPTCBQ3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic \"Z\" Series in one word ... ROCKS!As a professional Photographer, image quality is everything.  Forget about what you may have seen, heard, or read from the big-spenders over at Canon or anybody else.  NOBODY has a P & S that can hold a candle to a Panasonic Lumix.  I know, I've used or owned most of them, done side-by-side pixel comparisons . . . and dollar for dollar they can't touch the image quality you'll see right out of the box with this camera.Here's why: Lumix cameras have Leica lenses - which are quite possibly the finest glass in the business. Second, Lumix cameras have set the standard for image stabilization, which is extremely important for razor sharp images.  Lastly, you don't need to think about getting a perfectly exposed picture, because Panasonic Lumix camera have the most advanced calibration system.  Put it in iA mode (Intelligent Auto) you can be assured you're going to have a perfectly exposed image 99% of the time.

Stephens", "ReviewID": "R3V2IRGX6S38P4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a combined Sony DSC-H55 and Panasonic DMC-ZS5 review. My wife first bought the Sony and was happy until she shot some video. We next tried the Panasonic. They both are very close in the photo results. In normal light and 1 to 3X focal length, they are for the most part equal with Sony having the edge. At max telephoto the sharper lens of the Panasonic makes itself known. In poor light the Sony is very soft and the Panasonic is sharper but noisier. If you don't use either camera for video they are quite close. Now video is another matter. Here it is straight from the properties from a clip from each camera. The Sony records at 1280x720 data rate 9,148 29 frames/second. The Panasonic records at 1280x720 data rate 31,168 30 frames/second. Sony uses MP4 and Panasonic uses MOV. Sony's video is good only for video sharing, moving video to MP4 devices and the like, a lot of pixilation. Shown on a large 16x9 LCD display it is worse than a good SD video. We did not look at the Canon because they lock out the zoom when shooting video. The Panasonic focus while zooming is quite good. There is some zoom noise but it is low. I would recommend a bridge camera if you can get by with the larger size and greater cost as the P/S large telephoto lens/sensor are just too much of a compromise.  In summary, Sony photo 3.6 stars and Panasonic 3.5 stars. Sony video 1 star and Panasonic video 4 stars. Best P/S I've seen is the Canon SD780 IS 3X telephoto. Because we had this camera to compare to, the Sony and Panasonic got low marks in sharpness and noise.Update 8-2-2010: I removed the camera from i/A mode and set the ISO not to go over ISO 200. We are now getting much better photos. The Panasonic I/A mode moved the ISO up too quick.

I was looking for a replacement of a Canon A80 that finally died after a number of years.  I was also hoping for a camera to replace an old Canon G1 that I've used for years for eBay (it takes very good close-ups, but has trouble with some colors, and focusing on reflective objects).  I primarily wanted a small point and shoot for my wife, and for times I just need to take a quick snapshot.  I also want some manual flexibility to take pics for eBay, etc.  I use a Canon 30D for most picture taking, and consider myself an enthusiastic amateur.I took about 40 pictures today from landscapes to macros to portraits ... full sun, indoors with the flash ... mostly in iA ('intelligent auto') mode and some in 'P' mode.  Wide angle pics, and zoomed all the way in, and in-between.  I would rate each shot from poor to fair.  One photo of my wife in full sun was 'good.'  I loaded the pics into Lightroom, and looked at each at full size (12M, 1:1).  Each and every image looks pixelated to me: edges are not crisp, with feathering evident almost everywhere.  Not one was as sharp as I would expect...in fact poorer than the much older Canon cameras!  Of course, it's possible I received a camera with a problem, but I'm not willing to try a replacement.  The photos are so poor that I am returning it to \"OneCall\" (company) on Monday.  Most unfortunate is the 15% open box penalty I need to pay to return it.  One possibility mentioned by another reviewer is that the 'iA' mode is the source of the quality problem.  Most of the pictures I took were in this mode and some of the images look \"over-processed\" to me.  For example, grass looks unnatural, the colors seem \"monotone.\"  I can see obvious noise in shadows.  I thought that maybe the camera was using a high ISO setting, but most of the outdoor photos were at 80.This is what else I can say about the camera....  The controls and menu system are well thought out: it was easy to use.  The zoom seemed a little \"touchy\" ... a bit too fast and it was easy to zoom too far (but this is probably something one can learn to compensate for).  Macros seemed good: you can get very close to an object, so I was hoping it would do well for eBay.  However, again, looking at full size images, there was some blotchy pixelization (sp?) that was very evident.  Of course photos for eBay would not be so large and these faults would not be so noticeable, but that doesn't save the camera. Some of the outdoor photos were \"blown out\" ... meaning highlights were totally washed out.  None of the photos \"popped\" ... colors seemed somewhat muted.While writing this, I decided to try another test.  I took a number of photos of a stark object with deep blacks, whites and primary colors (a can of spray paint).  The lettering, for example, is a crisp white font on a pure black back-ground (I checked the edges with a loupe to make sure).  There are bands of deep colors next to one-another.  Each photo I took rendered the colors ok, but there was a definite gray fringe around all the white letters.  A band of deep yellow next to a band of deep blue clearly showed yellow bleeding into the blue.  I took the same photos with the Canon G1, and this was not evident (of course, the Panasonic pictures were larger than the G1's, but I couldn't see any trace of this problem with the old Canon).I cannot recommend this camera based on my limited experience with it.  Maybe I received a lemon, but I suspect the 'iA' mode is at fault.  I've purchased many items from Amazon over the years, and this is perhaps the first one that I must give a negative rating.  I'm also not so thrilled about the $40 I need to pay \"Onecall\" to test drive a dud.  There are other purchasing options (for about the same price) that do NOT charge a 15% restocking fee if only a limited number of pictures are taken.  I would advise buyers to check first.  I will go a different route when I buy the camera that will replace thisPanasonic.5/9/2010 UPDATE:  I'd like to acknowledge that the restocking fee was waived by OneCall (vendor).  When I received the return authorization I was told about the fee, and when I responded to a followup email, I expressed my displeasure for the reasons I mention above.  I LIKED the camera, but thought the quality a problem.  A return email--late last night, indicated they would remove the fee.  This was very gracious of them.  Their customer service proved in the end to be excellent!  I added a star to the review since I am happier with the overall experience, and don't want the review to reflect negatively on the vendor (only the camera).", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "So, what did I think", "Author": "jbe", "ReviewID": "R2FQASNUBINHF3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not a professional photog, nor an acclaimed amateur, just someone who likes to take pictures and loves gadgets - especially cameras.

The door, just like most other digital cameras, is flimsy, but the problem here is that the latch used to secure the door seems cheap.

I've owned it for about 4 months now and I have taken it everywhere and produced some fantastic photos including some shots of the President, the 1st lady, tons of celebrities, landscapes, NBA games, party photos, and even a panoramic of the Boston skyline at night which came out great. The zoom is phenomenal, it really gets you right up close compared to most point/shoot cameras. The picture quality is outstanding. I previously owned a Canon Powershot which was okay but produced more unusable photos than usable.This camera is a little bulky, but it is far worth it considering the lens capabilities. Also, like mentioned by others, the HD video is fantastic. I shot some footage around Times Square, (granted there's tons of light there) and even at night it looked like real HD Camcorder quality. The flash works good, however in low light conditions you will get a little blurry without a tri-pod, nothing new there. I find that if you use burst mode (which does disable the flash) you will get at least 1 out of 5 perfect shots and just delete the rest.

I bought it back in June 2010 (it is now March 2011) and I have loved it dearly. My future brother in law researched the best camera for himself to buy, and I just went and bought one also. I will upload a few of the better shots I've taken with it to the customer action shots section. I paid about $220 for it back then, and now it is dropped in price to about $180, so it is even a better deal.I obviously haven't gone out and tried every single camera out there, and I'm not some kind of photo-phile (or I wouldn't have bought a $220 camera), so that is where I am coming from. I'm not a professional reviewer or anything, I'm just giving my opinion. I have used many cheaper (sub $300) digital cameras before, as that's usually all I buy. This camera doesn't suffer from any of the problems I've usually seen cameras suffer from, like failure to focus quickly, or taking for _freaking_ever_ to process a single picture. This camera is pretty quick, even with flash on, and usually takes a great picture the first time. Now I can't say it is a perfect camera without faults and takes the best pictures ever, because then it would probably cost more than $200, right? And then you'd probably just end up dropping it and breaking your $1000 camera, I know I would.PROS:CheapHuge lens and 12x optical zoomLots of options for taking customized shotsTakes pictures pretty quicklyCONS:Not as good as a $500 or $1000 camera, obviouslyBattery latch seems flimsy and light, but i think it might be because it is spring loaded, and I haven't had any problemsTo really get the most out of this camera, you will have to play around with the settings a bit, which might be complicated at first, but the Automatic mode probably works fine for most situationsThis camera has taken many good pictures, and many bad pictures. The LCD screen is so big, though, that you can usually tell right off the bat if the image was blurry. The pictures usually come out great the first time. Even one of my friends said, \"Just use his camera... the pictures always come out good the first time.\" I've seen so many people struggle with their digital cameras (or, god forbid, a camera phone), not even trying to get the \"perfect shot\" but just trying to get a shot that wasn't blurry as heck. Once you get used to messing around with the custom settings, you realize you have quite a powerful little camera to play around with.

These were entirely manual cameras, not even SLRs.Ten months ago, I bought this as a simple, point & shoot camera, and I have to say that it has not let me down. Last week, I was visiting two friends who were building a new house. I wanted to take a picture of them in front of the living room windows. The sun was behind them. This is a prescription for disaster, with shadowed faces. The flash balanced the light perfectly, and I got both the background and the faces. No adjustment at all on my part, just the IA setting.I have done macro shots (gorgeous). I have shot a forest fire five miles away. I've shot in low light. I've shot in broad daylight. I've shot action shots. It has handled it all beautifully, and the knob stays on IA.Let me tell you about two other quibbles:The flash can take a second or two to charge up after a flash shot. I'd prefer it was a bit quicker, but given the size of the battery, that's all you're going to get.They polarized the view screen. That's actually a good thing, making it easier to see outdoors. The downside is that if you're wearing polarized sunglasses, and turn the camera 90\u00b0 (portrait, not landscape), it will appear black (until you take off your sunglasses).For me, this is what a \"point & shoot\" should be. Plenty of zoom flexibility, combined with a big enough lens to work in low light and an auto setting that works for me. This is not a DSLR, but it does not try to be one. It is a camera that is small enough that I take it with me a lot more. I bought a Lowe case for it that has a small pocket that fits the charger perfectly. I have yet to run the battery flat, but this way, I can charge it in the motel when I go to bed, without having to carry a bunch of bricks.I had pretty much stopped taking pictures until I got this camera.

It is not a handy reference item to carry with you, although I could print the info to carry around while learning the operation.The camera has worked incredibley well in the video mode, although the file is quite large.I have tried to use several of the options in the picture modes. The pictures look very good on the camera screen, but when downloaded to the computer and cropped to a standard picture size to be printed (5x7, 8x10 etc.),they are quite \"noisey\" or \"grainy\" in a lot of cases. They can be improved with photo editing software, but I am disapointed that they have to be worked on that much.I have not printed any of the pictures yet. I think that the printed copies, after editing,  will prove to be acceptable in most cases, but they do not appear to be as sharp and crisp as pictures fron my small Canon point and shoot or my Canon DSLR.Further work, knowledge, and refinement on operation of the camera may correct all of the negatives I feel at this time.

I looked at several other cameras from Nikon, Fuji, Kodak, etc and decided to give the Panasonics a tried.  I tried the DMC-FH20.  I found it too small for my hands to use and the lens performance was not to my liking.  I felt my fingers were getting in the way of the camera's flash and sensors.  Some of the pictures just weren't sharp enough for me.  I exchanged it for the DMC-ZS5.  It had all the features I wanted.  The ZS7 has GPS which is not that important to me.  I couldn't justify the added cost for that feature.Pros:I like the physical size and the hand grip.  It feels well balance with controls that are easy to reach.  Thumb of right hand holding the camera is comfortable and doesn't interfere with any control.Lens is genuine Lecia lens.  Larger higher quality lens then the one used on the FH20.  In order for cameras to be built smaller, you have to compromise on the lens quality.Images in good light are excellent.  Photos are sharp with good depth of field.Optical lens range from 25 to 300 is fantastic.  This camera is getting me to think about retiring my older Kodak P712.Menu system is pretty straight forward.  Took some time to learn were everything is, but getting use to it.  I most cases I just push buttons and found out how to access the different features without having the read the manual.Shot short video clips that came out great.  Beats having to carry a video camera as well.Cons:Low light performance is not as good as my older Kodak P712.  Experience a lot more noisy and out of focus photos.Weak flash good for close distances only.  I did supplement it with a slave flash for night time and some indoor shooting.I would have preferred a push button for the review instead of the slide switch.  With how much I switch back and forth from camera to review mode, I don't know if the slide switch is going to hold up.Shooting at 12 megapixels creates large files of about 6 meg each.  This takes up hard drive space and takes 3 times longer to upload to printing service like Shutterfly as compared to my older 7.1 megapixel Kodak P712.Bottom line:I highly recommend the camera.  I am still learning the different program modes and seeing how they work.  Every camera has its own design personality with things I like and dislike.

Maybe someone with more  experience would do better but I had these problems: 1)I wish it had a view finder.  The lcd screen in the bright sun was hard to see and I couldn't find small birds.  I missed a few pictures as a result.  2)  I wish I could see the manual.  The CD that came with it explains the computer side  but I still haven't found how to use the camera.  I would love to turn off the feature that shows the last picture taken for a few seconds which delays the next picture.  3)  The battery is supposed to last for 330 pictures.  After 220, the camera showed a full charge.  At 240, it showed 2/3 charge.  At 250, it said I had no battery power left and shut down.  A little more warning would help. That was my experience and as I said maybe someone more knowledgeable with cameras could avoid these problems.  I am going to try to sort these out because I've never taken pictures like this before.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a bad little point n shoot", "Author": "cianke", "ReviewID": "R33ZQG2H1DNRTV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently got the ZS5 to shoot pictures of my kids and to have something small and portable to capture those quick moments when I would miss the shot trying to get out a DSLR and mount a lens and....I chose to go with the ZS5 instead of the ZS7 for a few reasons. First of all I never shoot video with my stills cameras. I just feel that they are better off shot with a proper video camera. (I wouldnt brind a spoon to a knife fight either you know) I also dont really need the GPS function personally. It might be a nice feature if you travel alot but I always label my folders on my computer for my trips so I didnt see spending the extra for me. Last and not least price. I got the same image quality, which is what cameras are about, for less money.Overall I have to say I love this camera. It takes great shots. They are sharp and have nice color. My wife even decided to get the same camera after I wouldn't let her steal mine. My only complaint is the playback function switch. It can be awkward after being used to just hitting the shutter button on other models to go back to shooting pictures. I have missed a couple shots cause I forgot to put the switch back in recording mode. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It isnt as big of a deal now that I am used to it but and I really would purchase again after seeing the pics.One last thing I really love about this camera I love is the macro modes and how close they focus. I took a picture of a flower on a weed in the woods behind my house and basically put the lens in the flower to take it. It came out Tack sharp and made the little 1 inch flower look as big as a daisy.

So far I like it as a travel camera.Pros:1. Battery life. No additional battery was needed after whole day of shooting pictures and short videos at Seaworld.2. Wide Angle and Powerful Zoom. It makes my life easier when I need to take pictures across the street or cover as much scenery as possible.3. Picture quality. The quality of pictures comes back surprisingly good in most cases given the fact I shoot most of my pictures at daylight. The white balance in most cases is correct.4. HD Video. O.I.S. makes the video quality very good.Cons:1. Low light performance. Don't expect anything good after sunset even with flash.2. Moving object.  Better use DSLR for running kids because of the shutter lag.3. Learning curve. There are 178 pages of user manual to go through before you can master the function.4. Face recognition.  Sometimes it is not fast enough and sometimes the shadow on the face makes it fail to work.5. HD video. It is stored in mov file and I wish it can store the video in avi file and encoded in h.264 format which is the standard media player format.In short I like it as a travel camera because it gives you lots of flexibility in a compact body.

The menu system is a bit cumbersome considering the extra levels for a simple format or base settings functions. Canon and Sony are simpler. Battery life is good.

Those needs are: functionality (fast focus, quick flash); simple design in hardware (buttons are few and self-explanatory); a zoom with clarity.Although I've noticed this with every digital camera I've ever used, this camera is no different in its capture of light and color.  When there's an indoor picture taken using the ever-so-handy iA (intelligent auto) setting, dark brown hair becomes red.  Lowlights come to the forefront, and this same general occurrence holds true for most human subjects photographed no matter the hair color.  For that reason, I choose the M setting (manual) when snapping a candid shot of someone who isn't moving.  Sometimes I set it on M for any indoor pictures.I've found that objects are captured closer to their actual appearance outdoors using the iA setting.  Verdict: M is a good setting for indoor photography; iA is best setting for outdoor photography.The iA setting also conveniently detects the subject of your photography, and it selects the most appropriate setting to capture that subject.  You can see this as it happens in the top left corner of the display.  With this convenient option, the pictures you take are optimized.  Other features are a simple zoom function using the wheel around the flash button, and an easy zoom button that will automatically zoom to the framed subject.Overall, I prefer this camera for outdoor shots over indoor. The Lumix features numerous fun settings.  There's even a special setting for your pet(s).  The options are nice to have, and so is the video.  I've rarely used the video, but it is a clear picture with good sound quality.  If you don't wish to change settings often, I recommend this camera with its convenient (and high in clarity) automatic function.Camera rating: five stars...For ease of use, lightweight and pocket-size.

Considering the effective magnification of the telephoto, this is impressively small.  I bought it because I finally broke the Canon after 4+ years of abuse.  I'm a cyclist and dropped that camera several times while going 20+ mph - the last time finally did it in.  I'm hoping the Panasonic will be similarly durable.Likes:-  partially metal body feels high quality and (hopefully) durable-  wide end of the lens is noticeably wider than the Canon.  I'm finding this very useful for a variety of shots.-  telephoto reach - the long end of the telephoto has astonishing reach for such a small camera.  I know other camera makers have similar lenses on their cameras in this category, too, but it really is amazing to be able to zoom in to the same extent as someone with a foot long lens on their full frame DSLR.-  In good light photo quality is very good.  I'm not a pro, and don't look at a pixel level.  Most of the shots are only viewed on my screen, then emailed or uploaded to a photo sharing website.  If printed, rarely over 5x7.  The quality of the photos is fine for my purposes.-  Menu system is well thought out and organized for the most part.-  Image stabilization seems to work well, certainly better than the IS on my old Canon camera.  Necessary for my shaky hands with that long zoom......-  speed and responsiveness is quite good - better than most cameras I tried in this price range.Dislikes:-  Low light performance - no better than my old Canon, and the colors start to look strange (greenish cast to yellows) as ISO gets bumped up by the camera.  I'm going to start using the manual settings to see if I can find some that work better for me in low light.  The combination of small sensor and slowish lens is normal for this price point, but will never make for a good low light camera.-  low light with that long zoom becomes unusable, even with IS.  The aperture gets smaller at the longer focal lengths, and if there's any motion you just can't find a setting that can give a decent shot.  A tripod helps, but this will never be the camera's strength.  Stick to shorter focal lengths in low light.-  Camera is quite heavy for it's size - I know when it's in my back pocket when out riding my bike.That's it - overall a good camera and good value, particularly now that it's being closed out (Panasonic has introduced replacements).", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "love my camera", "Author": "shane", "ReviewID": "R1W9J0W5TTEQW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera, it is compact enough to carry in your pocket, yet has zoom to really get good pictures at sporting events.

I bought it for around $215 and I am very glad I did. It's easier to say what this camera does poorly than what it does well, so I'll point out some of its weaknesses that I noticed. In indoor settings with no flash, it does pretty badly if your subject isn't still or you are without a tripod. The flash is decent...A little bright at times for me, but editing on Picnik/Photoshop can easily fix that. This camera produces excellent scenery shots, but I think its strongest point is the macro shots. Just put the camera in macro mode and it will produce professional looking shots. There is a manual mode but the Program Aperture mode is so good that I hardly ever use it, it really is like a much more expensive camera the way it captures sharp details of flowers/food while blurring the background. The battery life is very good. And lastly, I enjoy fun photo effects so the \"High Dynamic\" and \"Film Grain\" scene modes are favorites of mine!

Unlike other cameras I have owned, the many options this one has actually improve the picture quality instead of make things more difficult and artificial looking. I love the macro, three presets are nice, the feature allowing me to reduce the file size and gain more optical zoom power is awesome, and the battery lasts just as long as advertised. One thing I have missed on my other P&Ss; is Nikon's \"best shot selector\" feature. But here I can use exposure braketing, get three quick takes, and then pick the best one of the three when I'm at the computer. It works just fine. I find that the image stabilization works quite well, though nobody should ever expect I.S. to reduce blur when zooming beyond 8X. On any camera, including this one, be prepared to use a tripod or some other form of physical stabilization for the higher zooms. Some people have complained about the Intelligent Auto feature, but I find it surprisingly accurate. It's the first camera I've owned that can actually tell automatically when you want to take a macro shot.Since this isn't your simple P&S; camera, be prepared to read the instructions and keep going back to them as you try out all the options. There's so many good ones that you'll enjoy every opportunity to try a new one out. One drawback is that the instructions don't have an alphabetical index, just a detailed table of contents in the front, so you sometimes have to search for the feature you are researching. The \"find\" menu on Adobe helps a lot. Panasonic blew it on the included image handling software, which I find useful only for reading the properties of photos so I know what settings I used. And even then it doesn't have a complete list of the ZS5's features.I guess to summarize, there's four rules to good photography: 1. Be there. 2. Have a good camera with you. 3. Know how to use it. 4. Use it. This camera fills the bill on #2. The rest is up to you, but with the ZS5's nice size, good quality, and great features, you have no excuses.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pictures!", "Author": "Kristy", "ReviewID":

But there are a lot of manual settings to fuss with if that's your thing. I like a combination of both. The O.I.S. is amazing. I practiced taking pictures while my hand was in motion, and some came out blurry (I was moving my hand fairly fast) but some came out perfect (when I slowed my hand speed but was still moving). You could take pictures while walking and you'd probably never know you weren't standing still. Even the best camera will give you a blurry picture if you're moving too fast, but I was very impressed that you could move at all and still get an amazing picture. I was able to take videos up to 8 minutes long, which I appreciated. I thought the quality was good, both picture and sound. Another thing I appreciated was the zoom. Other cameras I have used gave me very grainy pictures when using the zoom, even only to 2x, but this camera I can zoom all the way to 12x and still get an amazing picture. I haven't really tried extending into the digital zoom range much, only a little, and it still seemed pretty good comparatively. I like the size and feel, and it seems to be well built. There are a lot of pretty great things about this camera and I am very happy with the purchase.In short, what I love most about this camera is:- Great O.I.S.- Quality zoom- Video length- Size (I have small hands, and this fits well without being too small)- Sleek feel- Feels like quality materialsAbout the video I included, it is just a short video I took while at Igua\u00e7u Falls in Brazil, it isn't me talking about the camera. It was overcast and I was standing in a shadowy area, and the video still came out pretty good in my opinion. The falls are extremely loud, and the camera video sounds just like it did when I was there, except not as loud! You can see a butterfly flying in front of the camera a couple times in the beginning. (Sorry I turned the camera sideways in the middle.) Just a side note, this is only a very small portion of the falls. No picture or video will ever do it justice!

I wish it had a dedicated video button to start recording a video, and the menu system, while not overly complex works differently than my previous Canons and my DSLR.  I am getting used to it, but it still seems a bit counter-intuitive.  It also does not have some of the cute functions that some others in it's class have (smile or wink sensor to trip the shutter is the one that I can think of but I remember others when I was researching).

After a year of using the camera, I still find it to be a great super-light \"pocket\" camera with an excellent feature-set (super-wide angle lens, optical image stabilization, intelligent resolution, large variety of auto-exposure settings, and manual exposure control). Several previous reviewers have done a great job explaining these features, so I won't repeat them here. I consider myself an advanced user, and I like to experiment with several exposures for each composition (whether using this point-n-shoot, or my SLR) - so I always like to travel with (at least) a couple of spare, fully-charged batteries. The battery that came with the camera seems to work as advertised (~300 pictures) and I am still happy with its performance. So, I am upgrading my rating by one star (consider this as 5-stars for the camera, but 2-stars for the battery system & 1-star for Panasonic customer support).Now, the negative (or, why 3 stars?): Based on warnings from other reviewers (both here and elsewhere), I decided to buy two brand-new Panasonic replacement batteries (from the Amazon marketplace). Before purchasing, I checked that these were IDENTICAL to the one that came in the original box (PANASONIC DMW-BCG10pp). I paid over 75% of their list price - so, I did not go for the cheapest batteries out there. After the batteries arrived, I checked that both came individually wrapped in (seemingly) genuine Panasonic cardboard/plastic packaging. Both had identical markings their sides, as compared to the original that came with the camera. However, owing to work/travel commitments, I did not get a chance to test out these new batteries for over 3.5 months. Just recently, I took the batteries out of their packaging, charged them, and tried to use them. But the ZS5 refuses to recognize the battery, shutting down within 3-4 seconds with the message: \"This battery cannot be used\". I waited several hours, recharged the batteries, and tried again - with the same result. I looked online and found that this message results from ID-secure feature built into their cameras to identify non-Panasonic battery packs. I then tried Panasonic's support web-site, but found nothing related to either battery problems or firmware updates for the ZS5/ZS7.So, I called Panasonic's customer/tech support (U.S.), hoping for some sort of a firmware download or some other \"re-setting\" procedure that would let me over-ride the camera error-message. To my surprise (and after three phone-transfers), instead of helping me figure out why TWO, BRAND NEW, Panasonic batteries were being rejected by their own camera, the rep kept insisting that I bought the battery over 90-days ago, so they cannot help me! Now perhaps I am naive, but I consider a battery to be brand new (within a reasonable time-limit, of course), as long as it has not been abused or used before - so it should not matter whether I bought the batteries 90 days vs. 110 days previously (at the time I called them). They could not even tell me if there are ways to identify a genuine \"PANASONIC\" battery pack!During our extensive online review prior to buying this camera, the battery issue never come up. But now when I type the exact camera-error message in Google, I get several hits on this subject (all pertaining to Panasonic Lumix cameras). I was stuck abroad with only a single working battery, and TWO BRAND-NEW batteries that didn't work! I eventually found a Panasonic vendor in the country I was living in and bought another 'genuine' Panasonic replacement battery for higher than the list price - this new battery pack seems to be working well so far.So, I wanted to put this warning out there that in spite of Panasonic's advertised \"stringent\" standards that purportedly make their batteries so much better, their camera's failure tolerance seems to be so tight that many of their own batteries fall outside of it! I find it frustrating that there is no way to tell which of the \"PANASONIC\" branded batteries are really genuine until you pop them into the camera - even if you pay attention to details, or fork-out close to the list-price. So, the lessons learnt for me are: (1) Don't expect that the \"Panasonic\" brand implies a guarantee of quality or reasonable customer/technical support; (2) If you plan to buy any Panasonic Lumix camera, or any of their new ID-secured battery based cameras, check online for 'battery cannot be used' or 'battery failure' for that camera before purchasing; (3) Be prepared to go through the hassle of trying out several replacement batteries, EVEN if you buy Panasonic's own; and (4) Thoroughly test out any spare replacement batteries you buy within the first 90 days (I guess the last one's a \"DUH!\").I have never bought a camera outside of Canon before, and will most likely go back to Canon after this - I am afraid I cannot trust Panasonic to \"do the right thing\" at this point.Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS5 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic doesn't respond to customer needs", "Author": "rachyilicous", "ReviewID": "R9V3ZYXKXNECI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS5..within three months the camera broke.

It's zoom is 16x from the camera's starting point, which is not normal 1x vision.  Meaning: when you look at something with your own eyes, and then look at it through the camera, that object is further away looking through the camera.  Which allows the camera to take a wider field of view picture.  But 2x optical zoom on the camera gives the same distance as if you are looking at the object without the camera.  Which means 16x zoom is actually only 8x true zoom.  And it's not even all optical!  That was my biggest issue, as I was looking for a super-zoom camera and was disappointed to find out this truly isn't one.Secondly, this camera has a High learning curve.  Repeat: HIGH learning curve.  Annoyingly so.  The camera takes amazing pictures whenever the settings are correct for the situation.  The problem is no one setting is correct for even just all the most common situations, and what you want to photograph can change on you fast.  And the instruction book that comes with it has NO information on the dozens of different pictures modes and options.  (I haven't checked the digital PDF document on the CD to see if there's a real instruction manual on there.)  Here's just the stuff I remember right now of what I've found: - The intelligent auto feature works well outdoors in normal light, but very not well other times. - The \"A\" mode works indoors in normal light, but not low, and in sunlight. - Portrait works in indoor bright light and outdoor shade or other low light. - Baby 1 works best for high action, like dancing and sports. - Self-portrait is the only mode that maintains the self-timer setting you choose between pictures. - To get a fast recovery speed between picture taking you need to turn off image review. - Oh, and more than half the time you'll want to set the flash to force off to get true colors! - Etc, etc.Last negative in my opinion is that the door that covers the battery and SD card and is held closed by a latch is very flimsy.  I fully expect that's gonna be the first thing to break.On the plus side:- the video this camera takes is excellent quality.  I was surprised at how much detail and how fine the resolution.  Just keep in mind the camera can't light for a video, so it won't work in darker situations.  But get a large SD card so you can take longer length videos!- \"MS\" mode (which is My Scene) is handy because you can customize a scene and save it under MS for later use quickly.- the navigation controls on the back of the camera are easy to learn and well placed for fingers.- fits in a purse easy, and normal pockets too- the panorama assist is very cool!Overall, the camera is too flexible without giving help on how to make it work best, but when you come across the right settings it does fantastic stuff.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent point and shoot, horrendous customer service", "Author": "mamber-m", "ReviewID": "R2T1HMYGV6S02P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's not mainly about the camera, which is decent but no DSLR.

At the end, I use it like any other point and shoots that I own, so having more options than the average P&S; does not matter at the end. And I guess this is the biggest sales point of the camera.Image quality, weight, durability... all qualifications are average compared with other respectable manufacturers like Canon, Nikon, Fuji, or even Sony/Minolta (no American or Korean manufacturers included). Nothing stands out (positively or negatively) compared with other $200-300 P&S; cameras. I purchased because Panasonic P&Ss; usually get a good review at Digital Camera Review and I didn't hate the other Panasonic P&Ss; that I own, but it's hard to see any difference from my Canon P&Ss; in terms of image quality.What stood out is the amazingly bad customer service of Panasonic. So... my camera stopped working, which happens unfortunately. It is within the warranty period so Panasonic agreed to exchange (not to a new unit, possibly factory refurbished one. Cheap...). i shipped back my unit to the service center, and I got delivery confirmation. But basically the service center lost the unit (or they say they cannot locate the unit). I managed to talk to a person at the service center after a couple of emails and a couple of not-returned phone calls, and she promised to search and call me back in a day or two. But nothing happened after a couple of weeks. Actually 3 months passed since my camera was delivered to the service center. I sent several follow up calls or emails, but no response. I guess I have to give up.I think the camera is decent, but not much better to accept the horrible service.

When the camera worked, I was happy with it and could stand to deal with the other issues, but now I wish I never had strayed from Canon.PROBLEMS!!!1. The lens broke 3 weeks into owning the product. 2 weeks of lost time while camera was with Panasonic Exchange Center. VERY FRUSTRATING!!2. I had to fiddle around with the settings quit a bit to get the image quality to be good. A lot of the automatic settings produce very poor pictures.3. The way the camera save images on the SD card (file storage format) is poor. You cannot create folders. All files are stored in one AND ONLY one folder.4. Due to the file storage format, you are essentially required to use their software to download the images if you want them in separate folders based on day of image capture.6-10-10 UPDATE: Panasonic sent me a refurbished unit in place of my broken ZS5 unit. I was frustrated and asked to get a new unit, not a refurbished one. They said that was not their policy and they have done all they need to do for me.My Advice:1. Camera takes decent pictures, but not great.2. Panasonic Customer service/policy is not good.3.

Crowell", "ReviewID": "RMSX3CV883QXY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pros: Wide angle lens, Great zoom, Compact sizeCons: iAuto is iDumb, Features Don't Work, Very Bad Flash PerformanceMy Uses: Live Music Videos, Live Music Pics, PortraitsUse: I take pics of live music acts, especially in large venues and small clubs, so I want a compact camera with long zoom, wide angle, and good low light performance.Present camera: Canon A720is, 8MP, 6x zoom, 35mm equivalent lens, 2.8, 1600ISOThe specs on this Panasonic DMC-ZS5 are so promising, and the performance is so disappointing.There are two KILLER REASONS that I have rated this camera Not Acceptable.1. The flash performance is totally unacceptable. About 1 out of 10 pics come out exceedingly blue tinted. Take a look at the pics in this link. Two consecutive shots within the same minute, same camera settings, stage lighting did NOT change.[...]The tinted pics can be approximately corrected in software with -15% blue and +15% red, if one was willing to do that. I'm not.2. I could not get any of the advertised \"Focus Lock\" features to work. I tried AF Tracking and both Continuous AF modes. No matter what I tried, when I pressed the shutter button, the camera still went through the Auto-Focus process. The AF-Assist lamp even came on. Panasonic claims a 0.005 second shutter lag with these \"Focus Lock\" modes; not achievable.I have 21 OTHER REASONS why this camera is not a good choice. Here's just a few. If anybody wants to know more of them, I'll be glad to post.3. For what I do, the iAuto mode is essentially useless. All of the indoor live music shots that I tried came out blurred. The reason being that iAuto decided that they were \"Night Portraits\" and shot them at 1/8 second or so.4. Almost all of my pics were coming out too dark. I had to continually use EV of +1 or +2.5. The slow speed of the 2-speed zoom is essentially useless. The zoom lever is way too touchy to access the slow speed.6. The software PhotoFunStudio quit working. \"Cannot continue the operation because the folder or file is being registered.\" I didn't bother to try re-installing it.7. The Hi-Sensitivity Mode (ISO6400) is pretty much useless. I was shooting Av mode at 1600ISO and getting a shutter speed of 1/20, which was kinda slow. So, I switched to Hi-Sensitivity and guess what, I got the same ISO and shutter speed, except at reduced resolution. Why bother?8. The Quick Menu is incomplete. Still have to use the main menu for some settings, like turning Intelligent-ISO on/off. Having two menus just confuses the issue. Looks like two menus were designed by two different groups of people who didn't talk with each other.9. In iAuto I took a night flash portrait @ Tv=1/8 Av=3.3 ISO=400 Size=2560x1920. Why wasn't the size 4000x3000, like I asked for?10. I sent messages to Panasonic, via their web site, about #1 and #2. No response after 7 days. And, the message text block on their site doesn't allow enough characters to explain problem, nor will it accept attachments.11. - 23. Contact me if you really want to know.

During my trip, I felt like I was constantly \"monkeying around\" with the settings...and missing shots . Fortunately, my brother and his family were on the trip with us and he is sharing his pictures with me. Also the AI (intelligent automatic) setting did not take great pictures.

I chose this camera for it's quality and balance of features after researching extensively.  The camera is nice, but not intuitive for someone new to Panasonic.  I need to go to the manual often for small adjustments and feature instructions (I still reference my DSLR manual after several years for rarely used functions). UNFORTUNATELY no printed manual comes with the camera!  There is a little start-up guide that is nothing more than how to charge the battery and turn on the camera, but the manual is only included as a .pdf file on a disk.  Now, the reason I bought a point-and-shoot was to use it when I wasn't home so I didn't have to lug my DSLR around.  I could print the manual - all 90 pages - and carry it in a folder with me... but really?  So I called customer service and discovered that you can order one for the low price of $23.69 plus $5 s/h!  When pressed for the reason a fairly expensive point-and-shoot doesn't come with a real manual, I was given the response that it is only for \"advanced\" features.  I gave them a hard time and eventually was re-directed to a manager who said the most they could do was waive the shipping and he advised me to print my own.  When I explained I didn't want to carry a file-folder around and wanted a compact manual (honestly!), he said that the $24 dollar one was printed the same size (8.5\"x11\").  I asked if he saw the absurdity of this situation and he agreed but could do no more.
