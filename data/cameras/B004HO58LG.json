{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good pocket camera", "Author": "Doug Hibbard", "ReviewID": "R3N6SZ4Y9Y492K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fujifilm's FinePix Z90 is, obviously, a digital camera. I won't replay the statistics for you, since they are listed in the product description. Here are the highpoints of my experience with this camera:1. The FinePix uses a rechargeable battery which is included. The drawback here is that you must charge the battery before the first use of the camera. If it used normal batteries, you could pop them in and move on. However, rechargeable keeps the waste down, and ordering your camera to arrive a day or two before you need it will give you plenty of time. Initial charge actually took a little under 2 hours. The charger is included. You can purchase an additional battery if you like.2. Battery life: I have taken this camera along on a couple of short family day-trips and taken somewhere between 20-30 pictures each trip. Between that and taking pictures just to take pictures, I've taken well over a hundred pictures. So far, the battery has held up just fine and not needed recharged. This includes after sitting around and not being used at all for a couple of days. Let's face it: with a camera, you want it to work when you pick it up. This one does pretty well.3. Picture quality: I am not much of a photographer, but I can tell lousy, blurry pictures when I see them. So far, I'm not seeing any with my FinePix. The image stabilization seems to work well, the flash fills nicely, and the \"Auto\" setting has kept the quality consistent indoors and out.4. Controlling the camera with a touchscreen: this has been difficult to adjust to doing, but I'm getting used to it. I don't know of a touchscreen control that I've ever been truly happy with, however this one is good enough.5. Included software: I used the included software a little bit, but not a lot. I wasn't impressed and found the free software I've been using to be just fine. This is partly because I prefer to eject the card from the camera and use the card reader on the computer. I didn't bother learning the new software and just continue to use what I've been using.The other reason I chose to not bother with the included software is what I would deem my one major complaint with this camera: the USB docking cord. It's not a mini-USB or a micro-USB. It's shaped just a little different. This means using the included software for import requires keeping one more cord on my desktop or handy. Too much trouble---I'm already too good at collecting clutter. I'm not sure there was a technical reason not to make the cord match existing cords, but it doesn't.6. Time to shoot: this is my favorite thing about this camera. I pick it up, snap the cover down, and take a picture. My wife has an Olympus that takes slightly better pictures, has a better zoom, and a better video feature. But if our son is up to something cute and silly, I can get two pictures taken before she can take one, and that can be all the difference.7. One fun feature: I thought this was fun, but you might find it stupid. The camera can be set to take two quick pictures with one push. One with flash, one without. So, in those situations where you don't know if you need the flash, you don't have to repose or re-snap. It's done.This is a definite step-up from my daughter's entry-level camera, but obviously you can't expect it to be as amazing as cameras that run into the hundreds and thousands. For me, a dad trying to capture memories here and there, it's a good fit.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "A versatile and tough little take-along camera", "Author": "Jeddy 3", "ReviewID": "R2P9SSAHJFNSBF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Fuji camera. (My first was a sturdy sandproof/waterproof model, the XP, which has served me very well at the beach and on boats.)I'm mostly a Canon gal myself, and I have to say the Fuji interface takes a little getting used to. After poking around for 15 minutes, pressing buttons and exploring menus, I think you'll find this camera pretty intuitive. In many ways, the menus are easier to navigate than Canon's. That's a good thing, because the enclosed instructions are sparse (though a full set is included in .pdf form on the enclosed CD).This camera won my favor before I even used it because of the delightful \"form factor\" -- it's pretty, it's colorful, it's compact, it's pleasant to handle, and the sliding front panel promises sturdy protection from the hazards of my jeans pocket (where I habitually keep my compact cameras).So how are the pictures? Mostly the same as those taken by my other subcompacts. I gave the camera a workout in bright sun, shade, fluorescent light, incandescent light, and very low light. The scene settings work quite well and the Auto setting does a good job of selecting exposure and ISO. You could just set it on \"Auto,\" leave it there, and never worry about it again if you're not a fan of fiddling with cameras.There were a few ways in which I thought this camera was inferior to my Canon subcompacts, though. First -- the Auto White Balance setting wasn't quite as accurate as on my Canons. Second -- the lens lets in less light, causing more grain in very dark scenes. The Canons excel at capturing very low-light shots with minimal blur and grain. Finally, the lens is not as much to my liking. All subcompact cameras have a wide-angle lens that tends to create a fisheye effect, but it was slightly more marked in this camera than in my Canons. That means more distortion, but it also means it's easier to photograph groups or any wide scene.But there's a lot to like, too. The 14MP image size, though it may seem a waste of memory, is actually a real blessing in situations where you need to crop a shot for printing, or make enlargements. You can shoot great-looking widescreen HD video. And unlike my Canons, which have a delicate cover for their lens and a thin finish that dings really easily, this camera has a tough exoskeleton to keep it safe.One note -- the reviewer who said you can put the battery in backwards was right. The trick to getting it in the right orientation is to align the orange stripe on the battery with the orange tab that holds in the battery.The Fuji Finepix Z85 is a great choice if you need a reasonably-priced, tough, attractive and versatile camera for vacation snapshots, party photos, Facebook postings, and the like. It's an excellent compromise between image quality, features, size, and portability. And it's really important to have at least one camera that's sturdy, small, and easy to take along. Because, as they say, \"The camera you have with you always takes better pictures than the camera at home in the closet.\"", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great outdoors, sucks indoors!!", "Author": "Sandra in Tx", "ReviewID": "R3PZW9RMFHHWHN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera about 2 weeks ago. The last camera I had was a Kodak and I had that one for over 2 years until this past March I dropped it and the exterior zoom lens got stuck and no longer works which is why I had to buy a new one.There are several specs that got my attention with this camera such as: interior zoom lens (broke 2 camera from zoom lens), touch screen, slim size and it starts up pretty fast, 3 inch screen.Reasons I will be returning this camera: I just came home from watching my son's 5th grade class perform and was excited to upload them so that I could email to family and friends. As I was going through the pictures I was just saddened to see how poorly the pictures came out. Now let me say that I have had cameras for many years so I know my way around a camera and settings. That being said I made sure it was set up for indoor use and optional flash and what not. I compared this brand new camera pictures to my 2 year old Kodak camera pictures and the difference is soo big that I have NO other choice than to return and start all over again. As mentioned above, I was eager thinking I found just what I needed for a good price that will take good pictures. I was proven wrong.After returning this camera tonight, I will be looking into Kodak, Sony or Samsung... I should have listened to my husband!!Works decent outdoors but a $50 camera does too. The indoor pics were just NO GOOD!! Might be good for someone who is starting out with a camera but for someone  like myself who enjoys taking pictures of family events and whatnot, it just didn't stand up to the test.Hope this review helps others....", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "some cool features, but many problems", "Author": "Silea", "ReviewID": "R1FOKOZW23I95A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, the good:I love that the lens cover slidey-thing is also the power switch. There's no itty bitty little round button to push. You never have to worry that you've left the camera on after you cover the lens and toss it in your bag. Sure, you can't look at the pictures you've already taken while also keeping the lens covered, but that's hardly a major issue.I also love that the touch-screen allowed them to get rid of almost all the buttons. There's the button to take a picture, the button to start or stop video recording, and a button to switch from picture mode to review mode, and another button to switch back. That's it. Four buttons. Five, if you count the zoom dial as a button. Compare that to any camera with similar features.And, well, most of the time it takes pretty good pictures. You get about 600 at the highest quality settings on a 4-gig card (or twelve whole minutes of HD video), so you don't need to shell out the big bucks for a giant SD card just to make it so you'll always run out of battery before you run out of memory.Then, the middling:This camera uses a different USB cord than every other camera i have, or have had in the past. I liked that i, until now, only needed one cable on my desk, regardless of whether i was transferring pictures from my dSLR, my old canon point-and-shoot, or my camcorder. Now, alas, i have two.The battery looks cheap. It works fine, but again, unlike every other camera i have or have had, Fuji didn't bother putting the battery in a solid plastic case, so it's this odd, shiny white plastic thing instead. Maybe it shaved a dollar off the price, but i'd never be comfortable tossing this battery in a bag without putting it in some sort of hard container (though i do admit, i rarely carry my batteries outside of their camera).And, alas, the bad:The picture quality is not consistent. Pictures are very washed-out on overcast days, which makes this camera useless outdoors about ten months out of the year up here in the Pacific Northwest. Even with the flash, indoor pictures are pretty shoddy unless the environment is ridiculously well-lit. So for sunny days in the park, you'll get crystal-clear images with brilliant color. The rest of the time, well, good luck.The touch-screen isn't very responsive, especially the menu button in the lower left corner.The set-up options are arranged oddly. To turn off all the chintzy sound effects, you have to go to each one individually, there's no global 'sound off' option. Since you only get a quick-start guide in the box, unless you print out the full user manual from the internet, you'll be doing a lot of clicking through every single set-up option to find what you want.Images shown on the touch-screen are low quality, and often orange-shifted. When i first used this camera, i thought all of the pictures (even the sunny outdoors ones) were going to be terrible, because every time i reviewed them on the camera, they looked like smudgy orange-tinted old cell phone pictures. Once i uploaded them onto my computer, many of them were just fine.The camera is very slow to adjust the focus if you change the zoom in HD video mode. Sometimes it doesn't adjust at all. So if you use this camera for videos, keep your finger clear of the zoom dial, or you'll end up with a lot of High-Def fuzzy blurs.If you just want a camera to take quick pictures in well-lighted situations, this camera will do just fine. For people who are intimidated by all the buttons and such on modern cameras, this camera will be great. The slide-cover on the front will be much easier for older people to handle than the tiny itty bitty little power buttons on most little cameras. But for anyone with a moderate grip on the state of modern technology and fingers nimble enough to handle a few small buttons, stay clear of this camera.--Update!More bad: after endless frustration trying to hit the buttons on the touch screen (i have pretty small fingers, and never have trouble on other touch-screen devices), i found the 'calibrate' option buried in the menu. It takes you to the calibrate mode, where little X shapes appear on the screen, and you try to touch them. On most devices, this means the device will 'learn' if you have a systematic bias - if when you think you're hitting the X, you're always a little off to the right, the device will 'learn' that and adjust accordingly. This camera? Hah. If you miss the X, it tells you to try again. The Calibrate option isn't for calibrating the camera, it's for calibrating the user. Honestly, this is so stupid that i wouldn't believe it if I hadn't experienced it myself.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Pocket Camera But 1 Major Flaw", "Author": "MsAlexisGames \"Gamer 4 life\"", "ReviewID": "R32YZP73GOWWR3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Alright guys, so I got this camera (in red) for Christmas 2011. I've taken a few pictures with it and am loving the image quality. Not the best quality but for a cheap point and shoot pocket camera it's better than I expected it to be. I've recorded 2 videos with it, 1 in SD to test the standard quality as well as in HD (just earlier today) to test the quality of high def. Now I must say for a cheap camera the video quality is awesome. There is one major drawback that I must address about this camera that I'll get to later. I'm loving the touch screen of this camera though its responsiveness isn't always there. The options for taking pictures is good if you want to take advantage of the touch screen ( I haven't done so yet and probably won't but it's nice to have) and take pictures using the screen. One drawback is that it is high gloss on the body, so if you plan to use this camera often expect it to be a fingerprint magnet.Now to get to the major flaw.I put in a Class 4 4 GB SD card from my previous camera. It only records 12 minutes of HD video and 30 minutes of standard video. Now I thought being a class 4 that that was the issue on the recording being so minimal on top of it being a 14 megapixel camera. I tried adjusting the settings and it does nothing for the recording limit, so I figured then it was because it was a class 4. I then ordered 2 days ago on Amazon a 16GB Class 10 (yes major upgrade in class) SD card with Free 2 day shipping with prime. I thought it's 4 times the size and it's 2 and a half times the speed so this must do the trick. *buzzer* Boy was I wrong. I put in the SD card today to find out it had the same recording limit as before (12 minutes HD and 30 minutes SD). I'm now pissed off and don't know what else to do except write a review giving my honest thoughts in hopes that someone can help me out. My honest opinion all in all is that it's a good camera but sucks in that it doesn't record a lot of video.If anyone else has had this came issue for video recording let me know. Also let me know if you found a way around this problem.Fugifilm you guys have both a happy and pissed off customer with this camera.[edit]Okay so I read the manual. Come to find out you can't record video longer than 2 gigs per recording. Which is a major major flaw. If you're going to have a video recorder on the camera, why not let it record one recording based on the size of the memory card? Like I said before, Fugifilm has both a happy and pissed off customer with this camera. But knowing this information lets me know that this camera is to be used for images instead of video and images. I'm glad I found out this information. I thank my uncle for looking into it instead of buying another memory card.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix Z90", "Author": "loopy", "ReviewID": "R1EZ423JR15XM3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far I'm thrilled w/ this camera.  I wanted a touch screen- rechargeable battery- digital camera for not a lot of benjermins.  2 of my famlily  memebers have older Fuji digital cameras & love them. So after  I dropped my Polaroid digital - I chose the Fuji camera. So far whats bothered me w/this camera are: 1)- you have to take the battery out & charge it I was expecting  just a cord to recharge it ( like my other family members have)  2) the location of the lens-  my finger - until you get used to it- was always in a pic.  3)you do need to read the user's manuel 1st. there is so much  put into this  camera.It fits perfectly in a pocket and  purse..  I do recommend this camera for 1st timers. It is easy to handle & doesn't take a rocket sceintist to understand it. The picture quality to me is good although I admit I haven't developed any of my pics yet but does any one do that any more? I just downloaded them and sent them out. I took some out side & in doors and was satisfied.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "\"Interesting\" Change", "Author": "MussSyke", "ReviewID": "R16LR3F4M1VOT9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is what I call a \"subcompact\" - the smallest point and shoot cameras that have vertically mounted lenses which allow protection, compactness, and quicker start up times.  Normally, you'd expect a small trade off for these features, so I wouldn't compare this directly with a camera endowed by a telescoping lens.Sony invented the subcompact with the T1 a few years back (at least in my world), and I was able to compare the FinePix Z90 with the one-generation-older 12 MP Sony T90.  I'll go the pro/con route...PROS of the Z90:-Price is something like half of the latest subcompact Sony.-Operational costs are cheaper:  USB cable is non-proprietary (in case you want a second one or need to replace it) and SD card is cheaper and more universal than Sony's Memory Stick.-Separate physical buttons to record movies and to take pictures.  This is genius to me, because I hate to miss a great video opportunity while fumbling through the menus.-Does not come with a memory card, BUT cameras that do usually come with one so small that it is worthless.  Internal memory is better, because it allows you to copy from one camera card to another, which can be useful.-Can set it up to take two photos at once, with and without the flash.  As an amateur, I often do this manually anyway, but this way you get closer photos (chronologically)to compare in a dynamic scenario, and the subject needs only to pose once.-The panorama mode works better than in other cameras I've used.  They use internal weights alla smart phones (I'm guessing) to help you line up the next picture.  Allows you to \"pan\" a panorama shot in play mode.-There is a time zone mode that allows you to temporarily change the time (for timestamps).-The display changes from horizontal to vertical as you move the camera respectively.-\"Touch and track\" mode follows a subject.-Side by side picture compare.-Search by face, couple, group, favorites, scene, or date, and view a small picture next to thumbnails.-Charger is smaller with the plug offset to allow it to use only one receptacle on a power strip (as long as it is at the end of said strip).CONS of the Z90:-Picture quality was not as good as the Sony 80% of the time (tested in various modes and lighting conditions).  That said, a tripod really helps with low light and no flash, where both cameras struggle without it.-By numbers, it is not much larger than the Sony, but it feels significantly larger.-Sometimes the \"buttons\" in the corners of the touch screen need to be pressed more than once.-Tripod mount has plastic threads, instead of a machined metal insert.-Cannot take shots as rapidly as on the Sony-Does not tell you what zoom level you are at.  5x zoom does not appear to make a great difference over 4x.-\"play\" and \"camera\" buttons could be one button used as a toggle.-Battery can be put in backward, as the slot is not keyed (although the battery is).  No big deal, but shows something wasn't thought out thoroughly.Bottom Line:The Fuji is trying to deliver everything the market leader has to offer for a much more manageable price tag.  It gets an A for effort, delivering a lot of great menu options, and may actually win in that respect, but the picture quality is not as good.  If they could pour a little more money into the actual optics and the touch screen and still keep the price reasonable, they might win the battle in the future.  For now, it's purely a personal budget vs. quality decision.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's Just Okay", "Author": "McBean \"BJMcBean\"", "ReviewID": "R27T0AA0R4ZPX3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Generally I use a large format digital SLR but it doesn't exactly fit in my purse. This camera works fine for spur-of-the-moment shots, but I find that the menus are difficult to use. Because all the selections are activated with a touch screen, it's difficult to make quick changes because one has to wade through various menu options. Plus, I have a tendency to accidentally press the video button which is dangerously close to the shutter.I do like the sliding lens cover that also turns on the camera; however, the cover has inadvertently slid open more than once and worn down the battery.The camera definitely feels sturdy enough.

This Fujifilm camera comes in about in the middle for me. Not that this is a bad thing, as the cameras I would rate higher cost a bit more.What I like about this one is the size: very thin compared to many, but with a decent size and balance that makes it easy to hold and use. I have a love-hate relationship with the lends cover that doubles as a power switch, as it opens easy enough to open while in my backpack, draining the battery as it \"travelled.\" On the other hand, it IS handy and it does a very nice job protecting the lens.Picture quality seems typical for this price range. Fabulous outdoors, decent indoors. The flash is not amazingly powerful but again, typical for the price range.The touch screen works reasonably well and the camera is intuitive enough that if you know anything about digital cameras, you probably do not need to read the manual.

We bought this one because the lens does not have to popout to take a picture. The cover that is manually pulled over the lens to shut off the camera is fairly robust. The camera has most of the basic features. The large touch screen viewer is better than most. It takes OK pictures. Some of our pictures are taken on a tripod - so the 2 second timer on the shutter release is a good feature to minimize camera shake. The macro mode does not seem to allow you to get much closer to the object. I wish I could control either the F-stop or shutter speed in a semi-auto mode.It fits good in almost any pocket and is well protected until you point and shoot. Don't expect DSLR results, but you can get good snap shots in places you might not take a DSLR.The owners manual leaves a lot to be desired when you want to do some more advanced work.

It comes in a variety of colors, but I like the bright red finish of the camera I have. The design is unique from other cameras - it resembles a wallet or envelope. To turn the camera on, you simply slide the lens cover down; this is the part of the camera that looks like an envelope flap. Some of the options are a little harder to use than other small cameras, but the available features are worth a little time to learn to use.Besides the stylish design, I like the many innovative features of the camera. For example, it's very easy to switch from playback to camera mode with the buttons on the camera. Once in playback mode, I found the functionality to have many more options compared to other similar cameras. You can compare photos side-by-side or with the press of an on-screen button, you can display thumbnails of several photos at once.There are too many features to describe each one in detail, but below is a summary of my favorites:* Good picture quality for size and type of camera* Many settings manageable by touching the screen* Robust playback mode* Includes lithium ion battery and charger* Ability to take one photo without flash and immediately take same picture with flash and compare results side-by-side (Great for taking an initial photo to test lighting conditions)* Can load photos to PC even without the included software using standard windows functionality* In Playback mode, can go to Menu and select specific photo. Then when photos are loaded to the PC, only those selected photos will be uploaded to Facebook.* Zoom in/out easily by touching a round button on top of the camera - easier to get to and use than the bars on other cameras that must be tapped on one end or the other to zoom in and out* Can select a mode that allows a photo to be taken by touching the screen instead of the shutter button* When turning the camera vertically to take a picture, the menu options are automatically displayed in a portrait mode so they are easy to readOverall, this camera has several unique, up-to-date features that are surprising, especially for a camera at this price point. The stylish design makes it a great choice for adults or teens. Facebook and YouTube users will appreciate the technology making is easier than ever to post photos and video clips.

This camera is basically the logical upgrade from that unit, and it's slightly more feature-rich than similarly-priced cameras aimed at \"serious\" photographers.The Z90 has a lot of nifty settings and takes good looking pics. It has a powerful flash which will unfortunately drain the battery rapidly. The touchscreen is intuitive but a bit finickey (use your fingernail!) and is a big step up from the context-sensitive buttons or command wheels on older models. All the picture modes seem useful, and I found them all pretty easy to work out. You can even tap stuff to shoot it if you're used to smartphones. Zoom is clear and usable. Macro mode, like on our J10, works really well. The camera itself looks great and boasts a slide-open activation that's fairly intuitive. Low light focusing takes a few seconds, but the images come out pretty clear. Like the J10 the body feels solid and well-built.Criticisms are few but would include the finicky detection on some buttons on the touch screen and the fact that 38MB of on-board memory is a total joke for the huge pictures this camera can take. Of course you'll be using memory cards so this is no deal-breaker.Note that you will want a carrying case as the touchscreen occupies most of the back of the camera and there are no points for mounting a protective cover.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fuji", "Author": "Neil Chapman", "ReviewID": "R5A7UUBT4D28V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Unrateable.

One feature I really like is that the wall charger for the camera is very compact, doesn't have any wires, and doesn't require you to charge the entire camera on a tabletop like most models. For this camera, you just take the battery out of the camera and snap it into the charger. Also, when it's completely charged, it has a green light to indicate it's finished. The camera itself is compact and fits easily inside any case - I love how it has a slide down lens cover, which also turns it on when you slide it down.The photos come out crisp and in high definition and the zoom range is excellent and clear. The only problem with that is when you zoom in as far as it will go, the photos come out a little grainy. By far the best feature is the large touch screen on which you can view stored photos, adjust all the settings, and record video. It's extremely user friendly.

EVER TRY to get  a 3 year old to hold or repose something cute they did? expression? or action? tell him wait for the flash (forget it) - gone......-  Very disappointed. the focus doesn't do so good and I have not found a setting that \"PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS\" yet - I'm not TOO crazy about the video results of this critter either Have attempted many shots of bike riding, kite flying, bubble blowing, not exactly really good results as I keep trying to 'chew threw the \"micro print of the manuel of the camera. - Another real concern, The design (who ever created  this littl monster was obviously Right handed and has NO clue or concern about left handed folks, the lens is in the UPPER left corner of the camera, if you are left handed, (I am ambidextrous so I use both hands equally,) I wind up using my left a lot without realizing it- the problem with that? Just trying to grab a quick shot of something fun going on,  I wind up getting the top of the subject, grandkid or one of my kids head or something cut off by a finger or thumb, can't edit out a thumb covering a face, sadly A FIST FULL of these IS creating \"K.I.A.s \"Crashed and burned on this runway causing many to go down in flames of losses meaning a lot of pics just not worth trying to save to that cause (figuratively) just to the junk folder -YEPP I actually have a z-90 trash pic folder, perhaps I 'll sane it & send to fuji - someday just for grins,  entitled \"SEE WHAT I MEAN?\" it  gets bigger, ALL the Time :/  Trying to use the \"LCD screen as the only point of reference to \"framing the subject\" (especially outside)  mostly the littl guy to an occasional helicopter flying overhead - is all but lost, (unless in complete shade) the image \"washed out\" on the screen  leaving me to just \"click away\" I am coming to the conclusion that this not a \"point and shoot camera, is a \"point and HOPE\" you get something camera. this is my 3rd Didgital camera I have owned and have used more I was really looking to this littl gem would be a continuum of the J-38 model I had from before, was a GREAT camera,  simple, good reaction time and very good clean presentable pictures and video clips, both inside and out - my experience so far.

When I dropped my fujifilm in Santorini I new it was a goner. However, I had dropped it about 15 times previous so i wouldn't call it delicate. Anyway, I narrowed down my cameras and finally decided that I didn't want to spend more than about 140$ and if I had a fujifilm I enjoyed why not get another. This one is VERY EASY TO USE IF YO HAVE TROUBLE WITH ELECTRONICS. The touchscreen isn't that sensitive but I'm used to my ipod touch's sensitivity. It has a great panoramic mode !!! I highly recommend it for that. I could use my old fujifilm camera's batter and charger in case i loose this one or need a double battery! The pictures come out decent. It's not a 1000$ camera so you get what you pay for but honestly for someone who doesn't need complex photo settings it's perfect. It also has a setting called \"touch and shoot\" where you see an object in the screen , touch it and it focuses on that object and shoots it the best possible way.

Actually I still use the Kodak for my eBay auctions and we use the Sony for everything else.I received this Fuji and have the following feedback. . .1. This is NOT a $300-$400 Sony, so I can tell a difference between picture quality. As one review mentioned I had poorer results with indoor pictures than when I took it to the lake and took pictures outdoors2. There manual is non-existent! I guess they assume you can understand the options when scrolling through the touch-screen menu, but I found this to be lacking and had to experiment to know exactly what each setting did or didn't do.3. The unit comes with a 4Mb memory card, USB cable, a software CD and a battery charger. That's it. No cradle, not even a cheap cloth cover to put over the unit to keep it from getting scratched in your pocket, purse or backpack.4. What I really liked is the lens protection was superb, as a front \"plate\" slides over the lens. This is also how you turn it on/off, but sliding the plate away from the lens.5. The quality of both outdoor & indoor pictures on the display is grainy and awful. But once you upload your pictures and view them. they look much, much better. Thus don't judge your pictures by what the camera on the touchscreen shows it to look like. The screen is really only for lining up the shot, not for image review.6. I still can't figure out how to use it for video recording. Again lack of manual to explain the camera settings is frustrating.7. The images when saved to the computer are around 3-4Mb each and very high resolution, when set to the medium settings. I used a free program like Picasa to edit the size and quality.The camera does have a setting for Image size of:Large 4:3  14M  631 framesLarge 16:9 10M  836 framesMed 4:3 7M  1261 framesMed 16:9  5M 1637 framesSmall 4:3 3M  2850 framesSmall 16:9  2M 4137 framesTotal newbie to cameras so I have no idea what any of this means. Guess we'll have to research since again...nothing explained in the manual.8. Quality settings in camera can be set to Fine or Normal only.9. You do have a color setting of Standard, B&W; and Sepia. I think this is cool!10. The touch screen is responsive and the buttons big enough that they are easy to push without accidently pushing other buttons by mistake11. I didn't bother with the software they provide because those are typically low-feature freebies vs. something robust like Picasa. I don't need another installed on my computer that I'll never use. Picasa identified the camera just fine, no additional drivers were needed on Windows 7.Back in the day, my Kodak was much more expensive than it is now, but as far as picture quality is concerned the Kodak 5 megapixal seems pretty comparable with this 14 megapixal. Thus I think it is more appropriate to compare your existing $100 camera against whether you should get this or not vs like me with my $350 Sony.For $100 I'm good with my small kids messing with this camera and will continue to see about quality settings and battery life (which is holding up pretty good so far).But you get what you pay for in this price range:  an okay camera with a nice touch screen, nice color and good lens protection.

Mohlman", "ReviewID": "R2SW9EC5MJ8AWE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The FujiFilm Z90 is a solid point and shoot camera that fits nicely in the middle range of the camera market.  As another reviewer pointed out, the 14 MP resolution is what seems to set it apart, but unless you are printing poster sized pictures you aren't ever going to realize any benefit from the higher mega-pixels.  So if you are looking at that attribute and thinking you are getting a bargain on a high end camera, you aren't.  However, this is a solid, flexible device that definitely fits a need.Featuring the aforementioned 14 megapixels, a solid 5x optical zoom and the ability to shoot 720P HD video, the Z90 can do a lot of different things reasonably well, and does so in a robust, attractive package.  In particular, the lens is completely covered when the camera is off, making it ideal for carrying in a pocket or purse, or stashing in the glove compartment for unexpected photo opportunities.  Obviously everyone will use this camera differently, but for me it fits perfectly in the niche where I don't want to carry my larger, heavier Sony CyberShot, but want something more robust than my cell phone camera, i.e. concerts, kids sporting events, etc.  It's not necessarily the kind of camera you want to rely on to record the first hours of your child's life or a wedding, but for everyday use it more than fits the bill.In fact, the ideal consumer of this camera, to my mind, is a high-schooler or recent graduate.  As people who likely won't have/can't afford a high end smartphone or more expensive SLR camera, the Z90 is the perfect fit.  It's robust, feature rich, portable and reasonably priced which makes it perfect for someone in the 15-25 demographic.  Likewise, if you already have a more expensive, but bigger, SLR camera but are looking for something more portable and less fragile to keep around for unexpected moments, this is also an excellent option.Finally, I should mention that while the technical description indicates the phone does not come with a memory card, mine came with a 4 GB card in the box.  I don't know if this is because there is an error in the description or because I received the camera through the Vine Program, but hold off on buying a card until the camera arrives, just in case.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "S.

The multitude of options that I haven't seen in other brands of cameras is impressive, as well.For example, you can set the camera to \"follow\" an object.  That is, you see it on the screen, you touch it, and if the object moves (or you move the camera), the camera stays focused and has a cross-air moving with it.  I'm not entirely sure when I'd use that feature - but it certainly has a cool factor to it.But after the initial awe of a new camera, eventually you have to use it.  And quality pictures were an uphill battle:  The camera simply doesn't take good pictures.Low light?  Pixelated pictures.  The slightest movement?  Blurry pictures.  Using zoom?  Blurry pictures.  (It feels like there's no image stabilization whatsoever.)  Daylight, unzoomed picture with no movement?  Oversaturated pictures with too much contrast.  Everything looked like a higher megapixel version of a chintzy phone camera.I tried swapping out of the \"auto\" mode(s) to manually set up the type of picture and it wasn't any better.One of the few pluses of the camera allow you to zoom while recording video (and the video has it's own one-touch buttons, another plus), but the video isn't very sharp, and zooming during the video worsens the quality.  And regardless of your memory card (speed and size), your video length is limited to around 12 minutes.  (Tested with SDHC 32GB, Class 10 down to a Class 4, 4GB.)Another plus is that the macro mode (closeups) works very well, and was one of the few modes that would produce a picture that wasn't blurry.On the chance that you come across this camera and you just want a fuzzy picture to email to grandma, the other big problem with this little red Fuji is ergonomics.  Specifically, the location of the lens.  While most manufacturers try to keep the lens somewhat centered, this one is aligned DIRECTLY on top of the camera, so if you hold a camera with both hands while taking a picture, you're likely going to end up with a few pictures of your finger.  (Or worse, an oily lens as your finger rubs against it.)It'd be nice to think that I just got a dud that takes bad pictures, but I have nothing to back that up.  While I'd love to have a higher-end Fuji camera to play with all the interesting options (or even the same camera if it took crisp pictures), I can't see myself ever seriously considering another Fuji based on the poor picture quality of this one.  (And seriously folks, the purpose of a camera is to take pictures, good ones - doesn't matter if the menu/screen operate by touch or if it can read my mind; if it can't take a good picture, its not worth having.)Despite the Fuji having better specs (megapixel, touch-screen goodness, better zoom), for cameras in this range, I'd recommend the Panasonic Lumix DMC-S1 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black) over this one.  Regardless, I wouldn't recommend this camera.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Hubb", "ReviewID": "R3N0AQGVSQMTS7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please Please Please do not buy this camera. The only reason why I decided to buy this was because I desperately needed a camera on the spot for a vacation I was going to go on. The touch screen was cool at first, but got annoying during my vacation when I wanted to simply go to the menu option and crop a picture. For a $159.99 camera, it's such a bummer! There are no cool features. It's just a simple point and shoot with the added on \"touch screen\" that no one really needs anyway. But the most horrible part about this camera was that it's pictures would not upload onto Facebook. This wouldn't be such an issue for me, but right on the box it clearly states that it's \"Easy to upload on Youtube and Facebook!\" When that clearly is not the case at all. You have to go through a program that they provide just to get through to either website. I hated it so much. It took me DAYS for me to figure it out. I even went on the Fuji website and called for technical support, and got hung up TWICE. I'll never support or buy another Fuji product again. I went and returned my finepix, and got myself a Canon SD1400 for $149.99 (on sale). It was 10 dollars cheaper but SOOO much better.

The cameras built into smartphones are getting better and better and we're fast getting to the point that traditional camera manufacturers are having little or no success in maintaining their market.  Why carry around an extra camera when an iPhone 4 or a Droid phone can do just the job nearly as well or perhaps even better than most of the cameras at the lower end of market?Some would argue that manufacturers like Fuji have ramped up the Megapixel capacity of their cameras and made some improvements in their optical zoom ranges because of that competition from smartphones and that is a good thing, but at some point the megapixels don't really matter.  Don't get me wrong, to me, for my needs, higher range optical zoom rules.  As a frequent concert goer in the summer months having a camera with a good zoom range makes all the difference in getting a good shot or a nice video compared to a very poor shot or blurry and unrecognizable video.Realistically 5x optical zoom is about the minimum that I'd like on a camera and I think I'd really rather see something around the 8-10x optical zoom range (like, for example, in this recent Amazon offering: Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20K 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black), and even that is the lower end of what I'd like to see).  I know that I'd have to step up to much more expensive -- and heavier and less convenient for pockets -- such as my beloved Nikon Coolpix P100 10 MP Digital Camera with 26x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) or nearly equally loved Sony Cybershot DSC-HX1 9.1MP 20x Optical Zoom Digital Camera with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.0 Inch LCD.  Both of those are awesome at zooming in for great shots, but again, they are much more bulky and a pain to lug around.  In weight alone they wear a body down while hanging around the neck.With those comparisons and concerns aside, this is a servicable point and shoot camera.  I wouldn't put it at the top end, nor would I put it at the bottom.  Actually, in that bottom area, I could easily point at a lower end \"waterproof\" camera that I bought for my fiance and I to use while on our honeymoon later this year (Polaroid CXA-800YC 8MP Waterproof Digital Camera - Yellow).  The performance from that camera leaves much to be desired and makes me wish I hadn't bothered with purchasing it at the stores with the dog and red bullseye (partner to Amazon).Again, this is a reasonably good camera.  It's not the best, but if you are looking for the best there are options available here at Amazon and even from the same manufacturer (Fuji).  Note for this item you need to factor in a few additional requirements:  one, the installation of the software for \"easy\" uploading of content to Facebook or YouTube.  Personally I don't need such software and can handle my own uploading via more traditional means, but those that demand \"easy\" will wind up installing the software that Fuji makes available.  If you can't do the job without that software then this may bug you.  Consider that before purchase, but be aware it shouldn't be a showstopper.  There's also the need to add an SD memory card for storage. Most manfacturers don't bother to include a memory card with their cameras or include any real built-in capacity in their cameras, but you should still budget a little more to cover the costs of the memory card you eventually buy for use with the camera.Rechargable batteries (included) are a plus but can be a drag too as you can't simply run out to the store to get another set of AAA or AA batteries.  You can buy an extra rechargable battery and keep a spare handy, but again must factor that into the total cost of the item.I noted in the additional features that lens protection is good on this item.  The Finepix Z90 has a sliding lens/face cover on the front of the camera that protects the lens when you aren't using the camera.  I'd love to see something like that in place on the LCD display/touchscreen as my fiance's daughter recently encountered a broken LCD display on another camera she was going to be using.  I've got no clue how that display came to be broken, but without the display the lower end p&s; (point and shoot) cameras are useless.  Protecting the display when not in use would be a great feature but would, of course, add weight and realistically I must admit I have no clue how a cover could be installed that wouldn't obstruct the use of the display more than most users would like.
