{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera...some cheap add-ons.", "Author": "Fletcher Arc", "ReviewID": "R3MEMEAQMYMYH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will keep this short and simple.1)  I got this because I just wanted the body and got my own lenses.  The kit just threw in a bunch of extras.2) The tripod is useless.  Very cheap and if you use it you are risking your expensive gear.3) Camera bag.  VERY small.  It can only fit my A65 with a 18-250 lens and some small accessories and that's about it.4) Extra Battery - This is one of the best things about the kit!  Last much longer than the stock battery...by a lot.5) SD card...my kit said it was a Class 4 but when I got it...it was a Class 10!  Nice surprise!6) SD card holder, nice....I use it.  It can hold (3) cards.7) Cleaning kit....basic but works.8)  DVD...nice add on but don't think I will ever watch it.  Over all....nice kit.  The battery, sd card and cleaning kit are all good.  Hope this helped.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony Alpha SLT-A65V camera body with accesories.", "Author": "Geraldine G Baxter", "ReviewID": "R333EW6HJC3PNC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera exceeded our expectations. The autofocus fast and accruate, photos exceptional quality.  Still learning all about the camera. Nothing to dislike so far. I  have 300 MM lens and was considering a 500 MM but after working with this camera I don't feel I need it.I would recommend this camera to any serious hobby photographer like myself. The package was a great bonus without extra cost.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Grumpy", "ReviewID": "R26MBLGVJQF6UA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this product to be able to use auto focus lenses which i purchased for a Minolta Maxxum camera.
