{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just ok.  Not great", "Author": "Shannon", "ReviewID": "R3FMKUMW34LIKA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this as an upgrade to the 10MP Casio Exilim I already own and love.  I figured more pixels = better picture.  Not so.  Sadly, the pictures I took with this camera were not as clear as the very same pictures under the same lighting conditions as the 10MP version.It's been explained to me that the 14MP sensor is the same size as the 10MP sensor.  So each pixel is smaller.  This means that less light is falling on each sensor pixel.  Which in turn results in a more \"noisy\" photo.  That is exactly what it looked like.  The images had lots of detail but in areas where there should have been flat, smooth color (sky for example) it was splotchy and full of little specks.Otherwise the camera it self is full of great functions and the size just can't be beat.  I will stick with the 10MP version for now.  I've always been happy with it's quality.  I returned this camera.  See my review of Adorama Camera.  They made the return painless.  I VERY much recommend them.  Maybe someday Casio will come out with a version that has a larger sensor area.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Audio cuts out after 2 minutes on video", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R236TGJB649LMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got the camera and have been trying it out for a few days.  Its nice and slim.  Very impressive, bright, high res LCD screen.  Is fast to take pics.  The reason I gave this camera back is that after approx. 2 minutes of shooting video the audio would just drop and on playback you just see video without the audio.  This was reproducible with multiple videos I took.  This was definetaly a deal breaker.  I wonder if others have been experiencing the same thing.  Perhaps my unit is defective (but seems to work in all other aspects).", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Grate Digital Camera", "Author": "Irma Solorzano", "ReviewID": "R2D0TY14DPXHVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this digital camera for my birthday. I was kinda worried about It because of its size but turns out It was a grate gift. well to start off the pictures come out grate in HD the 14.1MP get the job done when it comes to big prints of your home photos also comes with a best shot button to make the best looking memories for you and your family. The best shot mode that I like is make up mode helps you look your best in every Photo The digital camera also records HD movie in 720p 60 frames. recording movies is fast and easy because of  the button on It. the Camera has a detected auto button to go between high HD and low HD overall this is a fast camera that  comes with all  the stuff you expect from a camera 14.1 MP, 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 TFT LCD and Wide angle leans the only down side for me is the power button it's hard to push and the battery go's  out fast because of the high HD mode. I will have a video review on this camera later.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stopped working", "Author": "Bsquared", "ReviewID": "R3AYZ0PB0S6ZMW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this product about 2 years ago from Costco. I only took about 50 pictures with it.  One day I went to use it and the orange light started flashing, so I put the battery in the charger and tried it again.  And once again the camera would not turn on and got the orange light.  I sent an E-Mail to support.  I was told that I needed a new battery (those guys should read the manuals).  I bought a new battery and it still will not turn on.  Now I have 2 working batteries and no camera to use them in.  I will not buy another Casio product.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its perfect!!", "Author": "daianacaliman", "ReviewID": "R1HAHU4XBMDOSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this camera before but i lost it .So, I decided to buy the same camera again.

We thought it was great at first.  We bought our other daughter one in May.  Within 2 months, this newer camera started displaying \"lens error\" and would shut itself off.  The older camera then started displaying the same \"lens error\" and would not stay on or function.  After fooling around with the newer camera, it will take pictures, but will not zoom correctly.  So, now we have an 8 month old camera that won't work at all and a 3 month old one that doesn't work properly.  We replaced the 8 month old camera with a Sony Cybershot.  Hope we'll have better luck with it.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "don't buy this camera", "Author": "Iluvdresag", "ReviewID": "R1GGDE8A4YOV03", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter 7 months ago. She took two pictures and the lens jammed up. Not knowing what to do she returned it to Casio, thinking they could fix it. they gave her such a run around, wanted to charge her to fix it (it has a one year warranty)and finally returned it to her a month later (after calling them and arguing about the warranty they didn't charge her although then they wanted postage which she ignored) So she gets the \"fixed\" camera back. Now mind you, this is the newest, latest edition of this model. And she uses it for a month or so, goes on a trip, and the camera has a \"lens error\". It won't work. So she didn't get to take pictures on her trip. She calls me this time and I said just send it back to Amazon \"they'll take care of it\", which was the smart thing to do because Amazon sent her a new camera. Unfortunately it was the same model, of course, and 3 or 4 months later the same thing happens to this new camera. She has given up on it and so I've taken it and gone through the whole process of sending this camera back to Casio, paying for postage, insurance, delivery confirmation, etc.  I called Casio to see that they received it (because they didn't call or e-mail me) and was told a part needs to be replaced and they should get it in a few weeks and then it will be fixed and returned. This model is such a \"lemon\". And it's such a shame because I have an older version of this same type camera, probably 7 years old, that has never had a problem and I take it everywhere. Where has the quality gone? My daughter has bought a Canon Elph, hopefully she'll have better luck with this manufacturer.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "New slim-line body design in exciting & fun colors with simplified rear button interface\nImage Stabilization\nPremium Auto Mode\nHD MovieSpecifications\nImage Sensor - 1/2.3-inch square pixel CCD / Total Pixels - 14.48 megapixels (/million)", "Name": "Casio EX-S200BE 14.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7 inch TFT LCD (Blue)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NBTUIIeYL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003Y74AF2"}}
