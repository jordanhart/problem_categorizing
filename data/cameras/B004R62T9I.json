The pictures are excellent even in low resolution and the resolution of the videos is excellent. The only problem I had was once reported that the camera was \"hot battery\" and I noticed when reviewing the normal. Apart from that everything has been perfect. 100% recommend this digital camera.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 8 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon Coolpix P500 Digital Camera (Black) + <2> Transcend 8GB Class 4 SD Card +\n<3> Sunpak Slave Flash & Bracket + <4> Spare EN-EL5 Battery +\n<5> PD-C20 Camera/Camcorder Case + <6> PD 5pc Compete Cleaning Kit +\n<7> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <8> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon Coolpix P500 12.1 MP Digital Camera (Black) with 8GB Card + Battery + Case + Flash + Cleaning Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kqXcVseGL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004R62T9I"}}
