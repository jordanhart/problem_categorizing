Did my research before I bought online, and got a great deal. The micro-SD card was backordered and then I received a full sized SD card instead. The full sized card didn't fit and was returned and my card was credited. The camera is easy to use and takes GREAT pictures! I love the panoramic mode for scenery pics. I would definetely buy from Beach camera again and I am an Olympus fan now too.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "What I wanted", "Author": "tbar2000", "ReviewID": "R1GS5WJG12MKML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third digital camera.  I wanted a very compact camera with good picture quality, ease of use and a good optical zoom.  After two weeks, I am comfortable with this camera and very impressed with the picture quality - even at full 10x zoom or when using flash.  The camera is no bigger than my previous 3x zoom and the viewing screen is brighter.  The image stabilization really works.  I got what I wanted!", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "evilsiskc", "ReviewID": "RWW40LGO62U11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera and easy to use.  I have always had a problem with clear pictures - they are usually blurry.  With the shake stablizer on this camera my pix turn out great.  I bought a bundle with a case and lots of handy extras.  It was a great deal.  I'm am very pleased.  The only hitch was that the bundle didn't include a microSD card adapter with the microSD card.  This adaptor makes it easy to take your camera to places like Walgreens to get prints of pictures. The little microSD card is way too tiny to fit into the typical reprint computers that are available.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kit Costs You Money", "Author": "Michaelquerty", "ReviewID": "RT7YR5A8DXNHC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do Not Buy this kit. It is horrible. It includes a Case that the camera will not properly fit into and snap correctly. It includes a memory card that will not fit in the Camera properly, (too long), whatever form factor the ADAPTER is to make the tiny memory card fit is wrong. Besides that, you get some universal clear plastic to put on screen, an extra battery (I suppose it will work, I haven't tried it yet), and a card reader. So you will have to purchase the proper memory card and case for the camera after you receive this \"package\" in.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Evita", "ReviewID": "RT7JFFU332WIZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was a great camera. The picture quality is really good most of the time. Sometimes the quality isn't great but that I've attributed to user error simply because I'm not the best photographer and I still have trouble figuring out which settings to use for which situations. Other than that I love the fact that the batteries are rechargable and we can plug it into our car. This was definately the best price around too. The speed is ok not the best I'm sure. Especially since I have small children that can't sit still for a second I sometimes do miss those one of a kind moments but since I can't spend several hundred dollars on a camera this was the next best thing.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - incorrect memory card", "Author": "IRISHKML \"myyanks\"", "ReviewID": "RA009A6NW4EJ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Love this camera - got it for my sister at Christmas who had an accident and didn't open it until a couple months after Christmas.  I ordered the kit which included the memory card. However, it had the incorrect memory card - I contacted them and they very nicely sent another one which was also wrong.  I don't understand if this company sells the product why they can't send the correct memeory card.

It worked o.k., took nice pictures, and gave no trouble. It's somewhat clunky in size and weight, but seems to have a lot of function built in to it.

At no time on the product description was it ever explained to me that I would have to assemble the silly thing right down to the straps.  I would not have purchased it had I known that.  I would have gone to a camera store.  I'm very disappointed in Amazon for this.Also, Amazon needs to counsel it's selling partners about green packaging.  Most of the components in this mess were bound in that very hard clear plastic that requires cutting with kitchen shears or better and will survive nuclear blasts along with outliving cockroaches.
