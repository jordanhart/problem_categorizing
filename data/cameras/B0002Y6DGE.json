{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No buyer's remorse with this camera!", "Author": "(alice)", "ReviewID": "ROBFJ9Q9SK2RO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after much research and am glad to say that I haven't regretted it for a second! I never write reviews, but since this camera has only one review so far, I thought I'd put in my $0.02 to help spread the word.------- WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR -------Before this, I used a Nikon Coolpix 990 -- fantastic camera, but too bulky and heavy (took 4 AAs) to carry around daily. For my second camera, I wanted something very portable (i.e. small and light) with long battery life. I didn't necessarily need 5MP; that was just a bonus.------- PROS -------Where do I begin? The EXZ50 is very small, so it's a cinch to carry around. So far, the battery life has been great. The start-up time is almost nil; no waiting for the camera to \"boot up\" once you turn it on. Even more importantly, it saves photos to the memory card very fast (my Nikon used to lag a bit) so you can take several photos in quick succession. The LCD is a good size, especially in relation to the camera. The controls are intuitive and user-friendly. Getting your photos to your PC is so easy: just put the camera in the docking station and hit the \"USB\" button! Tons of great features -- read about them on the site I mention at the end of this review [sorry, Amazon edited out the site]. Oh, and the pictures turn out great!------- CONS -------I do have a minor quibble in that the LCD display is a bit dark in low-light conditions. Maybe that's just a given, but on the Nikon, the display was bright even in low-light. It could be that I just haven't figured out how to fix that. Also, the macro mode isn't as great as on the Nikon, but I knew that before purchasing and it was something I was willing to live with. Don't get me wrong, it isn't *bad* (the Casio manual says the range begins at 6cm), but I take a lot of close-up jewellery shots and for those, I'll continue to use my other camera. Again, the point of my getting this Casio was to have something to carry around daily.------- THE COMPETITION -------For a long time, I'd been leaning toward getting a Canon (who seem to dominate the \"tiny camera\" field), but I read so much about the so-called \"E18 error\" that it scared me away (plus, I personally know people who've had memory card failures). I didn't go with Olympus because I read a lot about long lag-time and low battery life. Also, Olympus and Fuji use xD memory cards, which cost a bit more, and none that I looked at beat the slimness of the Casio. I already have a battery-sucking Nikon, so I skipped that brand. I've never been a big fan of Sony, so the Cybershots were out (partly b/c of those proprietary memory sticks). I almost went with a Panasonic Lumix, but it was a bit too expensive compared to others. Nothing in the Minolta family jumped out at me, either. You can see I mainly considered companies who make cameras their main business. I know Casio isn't strictly photography, but this camera does have a Pentax lens.[...]Overall, I'm thrilled with the Casio Exilim EX-Z50! There are tons of cameras out there, each with its pros and cons, so I know the choice is tough. Luckily, I feel I made the right one for me!", "Date": "January 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "two thumbs up for the price of one", "Author": "Gift Card \"Miss Ivy\"", "ReviewID": "RDWM06ULAJUF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im more than satisfied with this camera, not only is it reasonably priced, it exceeds my expections, and here are the reasons why:1.  User Friendly -  very easy to use, no complicated functionalities, outstanding point and click features.  Easy to figure out because features are simple and convenient.2.  Photo Quality -  photo quality is very impressive for what it is.  Best Shot feature is very useful and zooming in and out is easy to do.3.  Battery life - this is perhaps the best feature because it is very long.  I was able to take five 10 second long video clips and 45 still pictures in one event and the battery life was still in good standing.4.  View screen  - is very clear, nice and wide which makes photo playback much easier and more fun.6.  Shutter reaction time - is about a second its easy to take  candid photos.7.

I REALLY wanted to like this camera for all it's nifty features, but at the end of the day, picture quality was no better (and sometimes worse) than my old 3mp sony cybershot p7.  Here's the scoopPros:1. Great size/ body.  Looks awesome and feels solid.  Nice grip placement.2. Menu system is the BEST I have ever seen.  REally intuitive, easy to get to all the settings.3. 23 shooting modes!  And there is an example for each, you don't have to memorize what all the cryptic symbols mean4. Start up is very fast.  This is where the casio kicks butt over my old camera.4. DECENT photo quality, but...Cons:1. ... Picture quality is simply not as good as my 3mp Sony.  I tried every setting there is and took lots of comparison photos... day, night, macro, magnifying, using different sizes and enhancing them.  Bottom line: more noise and less sharpness with the Casio.  It's more megapixels, it should be sharper, no?  I have no explanation.2. LCD is big, but it is VERY grainy in low lighting conditions.  Embarassing.  My sony has a smaller screen, but it's not snowing all the time.For me, the picture quality is the deciding factor.  For others, it might not matter... The Casio certainly takes VERY decent photos, and I can't see how anyone could give it a \"poor\" rating.

The pics are (to my eye) great quality; the intuitive interface and controls and \"Best Shot\" feature makes it easy to use right out of the box.

I bought it originally for two features -- the 5MP resolution and the size of the item itself.  The pictures are great and look like they would easily lend themselves to enlargement without a loss in clarity.

I had to speak up because it's important.I've been considering the Casio Exilim EX-Zxx line for a couple of months.  I did my due diliegence at all the usual places: Cnet, KenRockwell.com, DPreview, Steves-Digicams, PCMag, etc.  I poured over user reviews.  I bought the EX-Z50.  My God, what a massive, massive dissapointment!!!!Let me first say that I am no amateur with digicams or 35mm photography for that matter.  I've been an avid hobbyist for nearly 20 years.  I've been in the digital mix for 5 now.  I shoot primarilly Nikon D70.  Like another comment here, I was also looking for a super portable pocket-cam when not wanting to tote the big rig.The GOOD:  The EX-Z50 is fantastically cute, solid feeling, feature filled, and has good pricing.  It's easy for my novice wife to pick the thing up and start using it with little instruction.  The screen is excellent.  The controls are above par.  As Ken Rockwell mentions, the Exilim line seems to have been designed by real photogs with features such as easy White-Balance and intuitive menus.  The unit starts up really quickly.  The focus is relatively fast for a point-and-shoot.  Shutter lag is very slight - excellent performance.  Did I mention this thing is small and cute?  Great design.The BAD:  And most importantly... the picture quality is beyond HORRIBLE!!!!  Severe barreling at anything past 50% telephoto.  Purple fringing all over the place.  But my biggest gripe is the MASSIVE, MASSIVE, GRAININESS in nearly every single picture in every single setting.  Imagine a cheap 110mm camera using ISO800 file all time.  It is compleltely unacceptable at any ISO setting on the Casio.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by the stellar D70 performance.  But this is downright bad.  I am shocked.  I implore Casio to take a hard look at their digicams before trying to pass them off in the public domain as good cameras.  This is a serious emabrassment.

I had looked for a digital camera for some time and loved the compact size and large screen that this one provided.  I had it for about 8 months when I went on my honeymoon in Hawaii.  I had not used it for that amount of consecutive time prior to this trip but of course was taking many shots of the scenery.  The camera started malfunctioning and locking up and not saving the picture that it locked up on.  This of course happened at very inopportune times and had to be reset many times as well, sometimes effectively and sometimes not.  I would say buyer be scared, especially if you are planning to use it a lot for one type of important event.  It probably was worth spending more money and getting a better name brand. The size of the lcd screen is great, however the quality of the pictures could be better.

I was an inexperienced digicam buyer, as the first one had been a gift, and thought it best to purchase at a photography store. While in the store, I noticed the excess of noise on the LCD screen, which I had never experienced with my Sony. I, nonetheless, purchased it anyway after the test photos I snapped appeared to be clear on the LCD screen. I used the camera the next day at the aquarium and was very displeased to see that the majority of my photos were grainy, and those which had acceptable quality were only the photos that I had snapped at close range.I kept the camera figuring that I was not accustomed to the features and was therefore using the incorrect settings to get the picture quality I wanted but, at every setting, I got the same result. Even the pictures taken at \"fine\" setting were grainy. The camera's performance was abysmal in low-light situations, something that my 3.2mp Sony always seemed to adjust wonderfully to. Almost every low light photo I've taken with this camera has been soft and blurry. Amazingly, the photos taken in situations where all lights were turned off using only flash assist were pretty clearly defined.In the end, I found that I got the best results (and print quality) when I took very large photos at ISO 50 and then resized them to be smaller on my PC. Shrunken photos were actually very useable.There are some pros to this camera, despite its many shortcomings:1. It is very compact. I loved having a camera that fit nicely into my pockets or purse for those situations when I wanted to get a shot here or there but did not want to have a bulky camera in tow.2. The battery life is amazing. There were days when I snapped literally hundreds of photos before losing power. The change from the 50 photo battery life of my Sony was a nice improvement.3. The quality of the video mode is better than I expected, and the videos are already in web format which makes them easier for sharing.4. The camera dock not only makes uploading photos to your computer a dream, but saves you money on batteries.My overall opinion: If you are looking for a camera to just have fun with, maybe share a few pics on the web, then this is great.If you are looking for a camera to shoot important events, vacations, parties, etc, don't get this one.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "EX-S500 WOW", "Author": "G.

It's pocket-sized with a nice size LCD, though not as big as the cybershot T1.  The snapshot feature seems to work the best because it doesn't manipulate/distort the image as much as the \"best shot\" feature, an ironic name for such BS camera modes.The categories for \"best shot\" are way too specific: Children, Fireworks, Flowers, Collection, Food, ect.  I don't take enough picture of food to have a specific setting on my camera for that.  The categories should have been like: indoor, outdoor, action, slow shutter-speed and stuff like that - keep it general.  I find myself taking multiple pictures of the same thing in different camera modes because I don't know which ones will turn out crappy.  Portraits and coupling shots are actually designed to blur the background, but the camera rarely distinguishes the foreground from the background correctly.If you can find the right picture mode for your shots, the camera can be worth the price.I probably wouldn't buy this camera again.

One other potential issue:  the documentation that comes with the camera is pretty poor, so you may feel the need to look online for instructions on how to use more advanced features (especially if you haven't had another modern digital camera).

Nice size camera for a woman~~too small for a mans hands.Summary: I've had the camera for 8 months now and was very satisfied with any of the outside pictures or pictures that had a great deal of lighting around to compensate for the basic lack of a flash ~ the flash doesn't really help unless you are on top of the subject. Inside pics in dimly lit areas are very very grainy and I have tried every setting to improve them with absolutely no luck. The camera comes with different settings, but even when I put the camera on the firework setting all of the fireworks came out blurry. The size of the camera is great for a woman with small hands but is awkward for a mans larger hands. The casing is very flimsy and was dented when accidently dropped about 4 ft from the ground (height you would hold a camera at while taking a pic) while my husband was taking a pic of my daughter. The lens which protrudes while taking a pic would also no longer retract into the camera with this very small accident. BEWARE ~~ if you drop the camera plan on buying a new one. Casio charged me a FLAT FEE of $200 plus other small fees. Total charge to repair camera $220.43. I requested that the camera be sent back without repairs so they couldn't reuse my perfectly good lens or reuse the battery or any other good parts and there is a shipping fee to return the camera. By the way, a new camera from many dealers on-line costs somewhere between $229 and $259.As stated earlier the camera works very well in good lighting situations ~~ poorly in dimly lit situations.

Maybe, other compact camera, such as F10, Fx8 or Optio-SV may be a better choice with similar price.better choice than this.", "Date": "November 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Seller ships too slow need to return this item upon reciept", "Author": "David Fries", "ReviewID": "R3OMHHDSXJ9CGG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera pon 8 November and as of 2 December I still don't have it.

I'm so glad I spent 6 bucks on the warranty and got my money back. Now i'll go out and buy a real camera. I was living in the dark ages and never bought a digital camera. I broke down on the morning that I was leaving for a weekend trip and headed around the corner to Radio Shack to zip in and oout with a new camera. This one SEEMED like it was exactly what I needed so I was satisfied at first. In and out in 10 minuted. I took it with me and was disgusted. Focus is terrible. God forbid you want to take an action picture or a picture with low light. All you'll get is a blurry, grainy mess. Anyway, one day I simply hit the power button to turn the camera off, and it completely froze, for good. Nothing. Took it back to Radio Shack, got my money back, and I'm gonna buy someting that's actually worth $300. Well, at least I got to use a camera that weekend for free.
