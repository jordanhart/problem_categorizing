{"Reviews": [{"Title": "More camera for the same money!", "Author": "WMU Officer", "ReviewID": "R1PD2IF6YGQYVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, so I have a very simple Zmodo 8 channel home security dvr and I noticed that the cameras that came with it really sucked.  That was about 2 years ago and ever since I have been on the hunt for better cameras for my dvr.The first camera I ordered was the 600 tvl Videosecu Dome Camera (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YZXQXG/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00).  When the camera arrived I was so excited that I did not even realize that I had actually received was an AVUE AV666s (http://www.amazon.com/AVUE-AV666S-Varifocal-distance-adjustment/dp/B00564VGK8/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t).  I was amazed by the variable zoom and variable focus on the camera that I did not even care that it was the wrong color and not the actual product that I had ordered.  Plus the image quality far surpassed that of the current Zmodo comers that I had.  So without any questions I installed it and have been happily using it ever since.So, I finally saved up enough money to get a second camera and not remembering that Amazon had sent me the wrong camera the first time I reordered the 600 tvl Videosecu Dome Camera.  Needless to say Amazon did not screw up twice and I was significantly disappointed when I actually received what I had ordered.  I should point out that the Videosecu camera is about 2/3 the size of this Evertech Camera, but believe me when I say the features on this Evertech more then make up for the size difference.  So, what led me to send the Videosecu Camera back was the night vision view.  I installed the Videosecu and eventually the Evertech Cameras on the overhang of my roof next to my garage.  The camera is pointed almost horizontally to capture the concrete apron in front of my garage, the driveway and most of my front yard.  Unfortunately when I positioned the Videosecu Camera roughly 5 degrees down from straight horizontal I realized that the LEDs for the \"night vision\" where actually reflecting into the camera lens and washing out most of the picture.  Well that made the camera utterly useless.  So I returned the Videosecu and started looking for a similar camera to the AVUE AV666s.Enter the EVERTECH 700 TVL Camera!!!  Stat wise this camera dwarfed both the Videosecu and the AVUE AV666s cameras.  With 700 TVL instead of 600 TVL I get better resolution (although I should note that my sub par Zmodo DVR only records up to 420 TVL resolution), with 36 LEDs I get 16 more LEDs for better night vision then the Videosecu camera and with a 2.8-12mm zoom lens I get the best of both wide angle and zoom lens capabilities in one camera.Okay, so lets break down some of the features.The 700 TVL.  Again this is far superior resolution then I got with the original 380 TVL Zmodo Cameras.  I mean it is night and day difference even in the daytime, and at nighttime I can actually see what is in front of the camera where as with the Zmodo cameras I could just make out movement but not actually know what was moving.  Compared to the 600 TVL resolution of the AVUE camera I can just slightly tell a difference when looking at the live feeds.  Again, however, when looking at the recorded video it is the same since my Zmodo DVR limits the recording resolution on both cameras to 420 TVL.The 36 LEDs.  These can be both a positive and a negative.  If you are going to use this camera for relatively close quarters or small, enclosed spaces I have to say I think your nighttime images could be washed out due to overpowering LEDs.  However, if you're going to use this camera for outside recording like I do the extra LEDs really help illuminate almost the entire recorded image even at the widest setting of 2.8mm.  Again at the 2.8mm setting on the camera the LEDs reach past 50 feet with ease but start to fade in intensity beyond 75 feet.The 2.8-12mm Vari-focal lens.  This is probably the second best feature behind the resolution (700 TVL).  If you have any question in your mind how close or how far away your camera needs to be from what you want to record, or how much of a particular area you want to record you should definitely get this camera.  The 2.8-12mm lens means you can zoom out to one of the widest lens settings that security cameras come in, 2.8mm.  With the camera set to 2.8mm I can view approximately 50 feet from one side of the image to the other at a distance of only 15 feet from the camera (hope that makes sense).  So at 2.8mm I can see almost an entire semi-truck trailer (not including the cab) with the trailer placed only 15 feet in front of the camera.  But if I zoom the lens in all the way to 12 mm I can see approximately 20 feet from one side of the camera image to the other, or about the length of a pickup truck.  That's a lot of zoom from one lens and makes this camera very versatile and for picky people like me allows you to be able to capture exactly what you want with this camera!  The other aspect of this lens is the Vari-focal.  That means that as you zoom the lens in and out you can also refocus the lens.  Needless to say that is mandatory because the image is completely unrecognizable if you left the focus at the correct focus point for the 2.8mm setting and then zoomed in even to the 5mm lens setting.  The point I'm trying to make is that you are able to focus the camera on what ever you want and you are not out of luck of the manufacturer's focus setting gives you a slightly unfocused image.The exterior of the camera is almost identical to the picture; the only downside was that my camera came with the logo MGI screen-printed on the front of the base. Yes, I did order the camera from MGI as it was the cheapest seller of the camera, but I did not expect them to put their logo on a camera they did not manufacture.  More of a minus to the seller though then the camera itself.  The other interesting thing that was not in the description of the camera was the small five-way controller that is physically built into the camera's cable.  I still have not fully figured out what all the small remote can control, but after one minute I was able to find controls for the camera itself that allowed me to mirror the image, adjust the color contrast, brightness, sharpness and, if memory serves me correctly, the white balance of the camera.  All very sophisticated controls that I was not expecting, but was pleasantly surprised by, especially since the camera was only $69.43, read cheaper then both the Videosecu and AVUE cameras!All in all, I could not be happier with the camera and not only would I recommend it to anyone looking for this type of camera, but I am going to be purchasing two more as soon as funds allow, as I do not think there is a better camera out there for the money.  Hope this wasn't too long and helps some of you on the fence about this product.  If you have any questions please ask and I will try to answer them promptly.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Wide Angle Camera", "Author": "jrod", "ReviewID": "R2RXWJC4Y369S0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have tried and looked for wide angle cameras on Amazon and this is the best camera for the money, hands down! The other cameras that I have tried just didn't have the wide angle even though they stated they were. In my situation I have used the cameras that were bundled with my DVR but I was disappointed with the overall view, for instance I wanted to get the view of the front and rear yards. Most bundled cameras can only cover 1/4 to 1/2 of 25 foot wide yard, meaning that I would need at least two of these regular cameras to cover these areas. I was impressed that with this camera I was able to see the entire yard with only one camera, I haven't even tried adjusting the zoom and focus because the factory settings worked great. With the help of the Metal Halide yard light this camera displays in full color even at night. The one that I installed for the front yard has a great picture too, it covers the entire 25 foot yard and sidewalk/street area. It too is in color but less so because the only lights in front are the street lights. With my other cameras when it got dark outside I basically lost the picture because of the low lighting, the night vision on these cameras give a great picture, I even get a good picture before the street lights kick in.The only two cons was the mounting system and the different models that I received.I ordered one camera on 9/11/12 and it was fulfilled by CCTVONE and I received the model listed on this page (EV-CDM368IRV), the 2nd one I ordered on 11/25/12 was fulfilled by Evertech-USA and I received Model # EV-CDM368IR V.7. The main difference is that the EV-CDM368IR V.7 has the the on screen display (OSD) so that you can make many adjustments to the camera such as back lighting, and picture adjustments (Brightness, Contrast, etc.) which works great. So if you want this feature then choose Evertech as the seller when order and hopefully you will get the EV-CDM368IR V.7 model. this model is also easier to mount because after you install the base to the wall it has a large outer ring that screws onto the base which is much easier. With the other camera model the outer ring is attached to the base with 3 small allen screws which can be a pain when you are trying to hold the camera and tighten the screws.Overall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ridiculous mounting design", "Author": "Ohio Guy", "ReviewID": "R1YK0NKT4ZG0VH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Does this camera work?  I'll never know as I never even mounted it.  Rather than use mounting screws to hold the parts together for easy disassembly and assembly, this one squeezes the camera ball into the holder.  At least that is what I eventually figured out on my own as it came without any instructions for mounting and the website is only for sale with no customer support.  They must use a hydraulic press to get the camera ball into the socket and then after sitting in the warehouse the ball fuses to the rubbing strips inside making it impossible to rotate, let alone push out of the socket.  Eventually I was able to force it out after a WD40 bath and holding my breath as I levered it out using my largest screwdriver against the ball camera (hoping all the while I wasn't going to break it), getting it back in would be difficult at best and then it's mounted FOREVER.  Yes, FOREVER.  There's no way to get that ball out again without access to the back side and you can't get to the back side while it's mounted!  What a STUPID design.  I'm just not going to do that so I'm returning it.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "They're working well", "Author": "AllAboutThisProduct", "ReviewID": "RITC5C61IO0DF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You may have noticed that a lot of vandal dome style cameras look the same, that's because for the most part some of them are the same.  I have taken a few like models that were branded differently apart to find that the boards and ID numbers matched in several instances even when having paid up to $30 in price difference, this means they were made by one manufacturer and massively branded.  Which one should you buy when there are so many that look the same?  Read all product descriptions carefully and note what is included as well as what is not included.  Make sure that the product title details closely match the product description and bullet points (features).  Pay close attention to the rated TVL (TV Lines), the higher the better, don't forget about the number of IR Led's as they will make or break your night vision experience.  Take your time when looking to purchase cameras, add dozens of similar models to your cart and compare pricing and features to get the most for your money.  This model seems to work well so far, if I have a problem I will definitely update my review.

Darby", "ReviewID": "ROJQTNCCNMDS7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "\"It provide you with the clear high resolution image\" is simply not true. Also there is NO disassemble or mounting instructions - I scratched it up simply trying to disassemble the ball/ring for mounting, so much so I didn't think I could return it.The outside (larger) base is 4.75\" diameter.  It has 4 mounting screw holes, each opposite pair is 3.75\" apart.  This base holds (pressure inserted - NOT THREADS) a free-wheeling inner base that holds the camera ball.  With much difficulty the camera ball can be rotated such that it eventually pops out of the inner base.A sticker has the words:Model: EV-CDM368 V.7-WLens: 2.8-12mmSystem: NTSCPower: DC 12V/450mAIt was a real pain to pop up the camera ball so I could mount it.  For others reviews I imagine that the white paint had 'melded' between the ball and the inner base.  I KNOW the black rubber spacers melded because when I first tried to manipulate the object the outer base and the ball moved as one.  I gently pried the rubber from the ball and then it became to move.  I suspect over time (outside) the paint and/or rubber will meld again making it rather difficult to adjust.Compared to my existing Defender camera (http://www.amazon.com/review/RDIH1ENE8UL5N/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B007ULV8I0&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=) this camera's colors are  'yellow' (there is no in-cable or camera adjustments) - I wish I could attach a .jpg to show you the contrast.For me the only advantage is the depth of field and focus, but it doesn't seem worth it for the difficulty in mounting and adjustment.
