{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Tons of performance in a very modest package", "Author": "Tom North \"TomN\"", "ReviewID": "R39C0G0FHG127N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very versatile camera and responsive to most needs.  It has a good macro range to go along with a super zoom range.  It compares well to a Panasonic DMC-GH1 which has a much larger sensor and more expensive optics (the lens alone is twice the price of this Nikon).  The Panasonic also produced higher saturation and contrast shots in default mode and this gives the appearance of higher resolution.  The Nikon gave a truer auto outdoor color balance and more natural contrast. Even at ISO 800 it was very sharp.  You can enlarge a few test shots at the DPReview forums by searching for \"Nikon P100 test shots\".  or if this works: [...]The two highlights that amazed me were the Nikon's focusing indicator system.  It is so cool that when you shoot a bouquet of flowers the display shows you each blossom chosen by the matrix focusing system.  You click the shutter with the knowledge that it is choosing what you want.  Wonderful.  The second highlight is the range of the optics from good macro, nice wide angle, and amazing telephoto.  Please see the photos I uploaded showing how well this camera compares.  What the Nikon lacks mostly comes down to smooth tones and fine detail at high ISOs; and this is only because it is being compared to a large sensor camera.  The images would easily pass a fairly critical viewer on an 8x10 print and seem to be better than previous cameras with this size sensor.Pros (so far):  Great focus indicator system, Display shows small green squares over selected objects for focus = ready to shoot, red square = not ready  Light, easy to hold good fit to my medium sized hands.  Articulated screen seems more natural than the swing out to the side screens (aligned with lens)  Quick access to shoot videos, focus tracking option, slow motion (lower res 240 fps),  Hugh zoom range and quite fast action, 1\u00bd ++ second end to end  Outdoor sunlight colors quite natural  Very good resolution lens for this price range and favorably compares to much more expensive lenses (see above photos, several are pieces of 16 x 20 prints)  Very good macro versatility (see blowup of portion of terry towel above)  Adequate viewfinder but very contrasty, necessary info in viewfinder.Cons (so far):  When shooting a video the focus is not able to keep up with the zoom (I reduced my rating because of this).  No RAW image option (less important with tools like Corel Image Adjustment Lab that gives me color temperature correction on jpg)  Lens cap rather than auto protect system, must remember to take it off before turning on camera (your notified when you forget)  Must use the menu system for several settings (ISO, color balance), slower but OK (hats off to the Canon G11, Panasonic)  Fast zoom over big range means it is tricky to accurately crop a shot (same with others though) Would love to see a 'nudge' feature for small changes.  Color balance with my photo fluorescent lights was tricky to dial in  Quick shutter in most situations but not all  No hot shoe for accessories and external flash  Only an adequate viewfinder  Minimum aperture of f8 (standard for cameras in this class, but would love to see it improved)  Screen does not 'self protect'  Must manually switch viewfinder verses LCD, simple one push button though", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Functionality of an SLR without the cost or expense", "Author": "Ralph Furlong", "ReviewID": "RM5SJBOE7M9WK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, so I gave it a title that probably makes you wonder what I could possibly be talking about so here it is:1. a really wide angle lens (26mm) for those close up shots and scenery shots (you know, the church with all of the spires that you have to backup all the way around the block to get into the picture).2. a fantastic mechanical zoom lens that goes up to 678mm to bring in those distant shots (an with a tripod, the digital zoom puts you into the far objects pocket!).  Keep in mind that with a zoom this large, holding it by hand is NOT going to produce a nice picture no matter how much stabilization is built into the camera!3. One handed camera that is easy to use with a single hand and light enough to do so all day!4. An articulated view screen that allows you to take pictures over the head of everyone crowding around the parade and still see what you are taking a picture of; it even allows you to take the pictue under the legs of someone standing in front of you or take that shot of a flower without having to bend down!5. A camera body and lens that looks exactly like the SLR Digital Nikon!  The only difference is you have a nice range of lens options that the other person (with the SLR) has to keep changing lenses to obtain.  The camera also weighs a lot less and certainly costs a LOT less!!!6. A wide range of shooting options from fully automatic to manual over-rides.  Several scene modes also help with fast actions shots and close-ups.7. A camera that you will not grow out of soon and one that even pleases the pro when they do not want to fuss with things.8. the option to use a view finder if you want to!  Yes, I know the 3 inch screen is nice, but if it is really sunny, the view finder works much better.  Also, it is much quicker to use for those rare shots that you did not plan!  You can turn off the through the lens view finder, the 3 inch monitor or both.A 16 Gig SD card (not included, the internal memory is good for 9 pictures) gives you the ability to take over 6,000 shots (enough for that trip to Italy) without worrying about memory cards.  While on that subject, this camera essentially becomes free after your first 900 pictures (figuring that film and processing for 24 exposure film ran about $10).  On a recent trip to the Tulip Fields in Washington State, I shot over 300 pictures in that one day!  So, the camera quickly pays for itself.On the note of cost, this camera almost becomes a throw-away on a trip!  Say you are in Italy and have been there for three weeks.  You have averaged 100 pictures a day (very easy to do) and on your last day of the trip, you drop your camera from the third floor.  You recover the memory card with your 2100 pictures.  The camera was paid for after 900, so you are money ahead, have your pictures, and do not sweat the loss of the camera!  (Ok, reality is that we will still be upset, but think how you would have felt if it was the Digital SLR with the nice zoom lens that you paid $5000 for!!)The only negative to this camera is that Nikon does NOT make a case for the camera!  No one really does.  However, the Lowepro case comes very close (a little large) with a belt clip (velcro for easy on and off), a carrying strap (detachable), and a carry handle on top with a front pouch that easily fits two extra batteries and extra memory.Speaking of battery, the included battery lasted for 350 pictures using the zoom extensively.  The in camera charging unit works, but makes it a real pain.  Purchase the Nikon En-El5 accessory package from Bargaincell (on Amazon) for $14 with shipping.  It gives you a spare battery (larger than the original- good for 400 shots), a quick charger, a 12 volt adapter for the charger to allow you to charge from your car, and a European adapter that allows you to plug your charger in many European countries, including Russia.This is one fantastic camera and a great price to go with it!!UPDATE TO REVIEW:I just returned from a trip to Russia (30 days) and I have taken over 13,000 pictures with this camera during this time.  I have used the zoom feature extensively in the many churchs that we visited and at all of the other landmarks.  The wide angle lens really did an outstanding job getting all of Red Square into the picture!  The zoom did a fantastic job (laying on my back on the floor shooting up at the cupala) obtaining the inlaid tile pictures in the dome!I made a comment earlier that a 16 Gig memory card would be adequate for a trip, but I found that I took almost 36 gigabyte of pictures and video on this trip!  I had taken a laptop with me so that I could review pictures daily, but had not intended to actually do all of the storage on it.  Well, that became my main picture store since I only had two 16 gig memory cards with me.The HD movie feature was fantastic as we were able to record several of the live performances of Russian Dance that we went to.  Having the articulated view screen allowed me to shoot great video over the heads of the people in front of us.  The only issue with taking movies by hand this wasy is that your arm gets very tired after about 10 minutes of holding the camera!  I should have thought to bring a tripod!!We only had one problem in the trip with the camera and it happened after I had been taking extensive pictures in a very hot building (over 100 degrees) using the flash (took about 400 pictures).  The camera closed the lens and gave me an error message.  Changing the battery did not make any difference.  My wife suggested that the camera had gotten too hot, so I waited 10 minutes and then tried the camera again, it worked perfectly!  It has not acted up since.  This happened in Moscow while the outside temperature was over 100 degrees and the building felt even hotter.  As mentioned, I had been using the flash extensively and the camera was quite warm. Over the next two weeks I took over 5,000 pictures and it never acted up again.My recommendation is a very strong buy for a great camera and HD video unit!!", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "So far I love it...blown away by the low light video", "Author": "S-F TV addict", "ReviewID": "R1O5AO2AAJ3AQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got home tonight with the camera; went to the store with the idea of buying the Canon SX20IS after reading all the reviews of the Nikon p90 and the Canon; previously I had gotten the JVC HD-1 $3000 HD camcorder and several Sony mini DV camcorders, and a Canon S2 (10x zoom) 5MP digital camera.  Before that I had the OM-2 (film) SLR, for which I have a zillion lenses.  We also have a Panasonic point and shoot and a new Canon 1300 elph.  I notice that a lot of people griped about the Canon SX20 focusing and low light, and even more griped about the Nikon p90.  At the store, they had the Canon and the Nikon p100.  I thought both of them performed very well at high zoom, during zoom, good focus quickly, etc.  Color looked good on the displays.  I really like the Canon S2 as a point and shoot (early or first with the high zoom); can't stand the low zoom point and shoot idea, since I want to be able to bring out things I can't actually reach (architectural details, wildlife, etc.).  I finally decided to try the Nikon (first one I've ever had) on the basis of the CMOS chip, 26 instead of 20:1 zoom, 1080p vs 720p, Li-ion battery vs. AA,  and mainly the fact that in the (well lit, but not blinding) store, the image on the display was much brighter on the Nikon than the Canon.  However, the actual pictures on the Canon were bright and nice, but it was easier for me to see to compose the shot on the display with the Nikon.  It was so easy to use I was able to record video or stills and play them back in the store; and it turned out the Nikon was on sale and cheaper than the Canon.My philosophy of picture taking is that I want to remember vacations, excursions, etc.; my ideal camera would see things the way my eye does except for bionic enhancements like night vision, zoom, etc.  But in particular, I love existing light shots (and video) and love the HAD low light sloppy low res color slow shutter option on the Sony camcorders since you can (for example) take video of your wife at dinner in a dim restaurant and have it even if sloppy, at least in color and something like what the experience really was.  So I am after memories, and not art, but if you can do art, that would be great.  Anyway, I had no idea what to expect out of this thing; based on the tiny size, ultralight construction, low cost, etc. I figured it would be mainly a toy, but I hoped I could take it on vacation as a one thing does all photographic tool.  I got the Sandisk \"ultra\" 16GB SDHC card for it, 15MB/s, figuring for HD you need the fastest card you can get.I had not read any reviews before buying it, but when I read them when I got home with it, I was pretty bummed out.. all the stuff about locking up, hellish noisy zoom, sloppy focus, can't use the zoom with video, etc. etc.I am happy to say that my experience didn't confirm any of that. (Of course, it might lock up etc. at some point, I have only had it a few hours but I have a theory about that I'll mention later.)Anyway, I immediately went around the inside of the house in regular low light condtions shooting stills and video.  By low light I mean some rooms only had light coming through the doorways from other rooms, some rooms had a few 13W compact fluorescents, one last room had 5 65W ceiling can lights on.  It was lit for atmosphere not reading books.  Bottom line is I had no trouble getting very nicely well lit pix and video in any of the rooms with lights on.  In a stairwell with no light except a 13W compact fluorescent 6ft outside an archway leading to the stairs the wall and furniture seemed v. dark brown; by eye I could easily see the color.  Where the stairs went up to total shadow, the camera cut out to black and white where by eye I could still see color.  In comparison to a 5 year old top of the line Sony mini DV one CCD camcorder it was about like the camera on normal setting, not \"slow color shutter\".  In other words, about as much as I could hope for.The zoom is not as easy to control to get exact magnification as the Sony, BUT (and this is important) while you can hear the zoom motor on playback, it is very subdued and I didn't find it at all noticeable..when the room is silent, you can hear it, but it is about like a very soft whisper.  In normal tourist situations I don't think you'd notice the zoom noise at all.  With a bit of practice, I was able to use the zoom to my satisfaction.Another pleasant surprise to me was that the hand held video when walking around the house from darkness to light was smooth and generally not jerky..the image stabilization must work very well, considering you don't have any weight to stablize the tremor of your hands, footsteps, etc.  The video even handles normal panning (aiming the camera forward while walking around the end of a table, for example) without any major glitches...if you shake your hand beyond a given limit, there is an instant of moderate blurriness, but it handles the panning motion by making the whole scene's resolution lower; while walking and turning in low light, it is maybe NTSC quality, not HD.  But the JVC HD-1 just blew up and went to blocks of \"ice\" if you panned, so I have no complaints about that.  If you hold the camera still (handheld, low light as described) the picture is very sharp and looks like HD to me.  So I don't agree with the review that the video is \"crap\".  I think it will probably be sufficient to take this on vacation as my only camera, but I want to try it out in better conditions for a longer time first.  My wife was blown away by the sound clarity, stereo, etc.  She thought it sounded better than the Sony camcorders.It seems to me that the basic operation (load, shoot, zoom, focus, etc.) is very easy and very satisfactory.  So, so far I love it.  If it had the equivalent of slow color shutter and nightvision it would be pretty well perfect (well, I'd like it to weigh twice as much also, to make it easier to keep steady, but even being light as a feather it competes well with the much heavier camcorders).The display, navigation, menus, etc. seem to me easier to use than the Canon equivalent; having just set up my wife's new 1300 elph.The comments about the viewfinder being dark, grainy, etc. is true in very low light...until you take a picture.  As soon as you depress the shutter button to focus, the viewfinder lights up in crisp bright detail and it's easy to see what you are going to get...I suppose that is some sort of power saving feature.  If you are walking around looking through the viewfinder, it may look worse than the Sony camcorder (or the Canon S2) until you press a button to shoot, then it is bright.  I can live with that OK.  In decent light (moderately well lit room at night) I don't notice it. In general, no complaints about the viewfinder.  The diopter control worked like a champ and I will use the viewfinder not the display for shooting..only use the display for playback.I like the flash being folded down, so you can suppress it if you wish (which I usually do), and it is easy to pop up if you want it.  The flash comes on instantly..unlike the S2..no waiting period on the first use of it.The Canons Sxx series is better in that you can have the display rotated out of the way (plastic out instead of display out) to keep it clean when you are using the viewfinder.In short, I just tested it every way I could think of under the worst lighting and shooting (all hand held, low light) conditions and it did very well.  I displayed the pictures and movies on a 44 inch top of the line Sony 1080p TV with mini HDMI/HDMI connection cable, and even handheld, you could zoom in (easy, from the camera) before you could see pixelation on the stills so I presume they are better than a couple of MP of usable info even under these lousy conditions.Just a word of encouragement for its capabilities as a hybrid camera/camcorder...it well exceeded my expectations.  With a tripod or decent technique it should be excellent indeed..and very usable without it.I am very pleased with it.  When it's daylight, will do some more rigorous tests of image quality outside in decent light.  By the way, it takes (handheld, so very blurry) time exposures up to at least several seconds of exposure ...so I would expect that like the OM-2, which was great for taking full color pictures of my parents' backyard in the country by starlight, one should be able to take pictures in very dim light with a tripod.If anything negative turns up, I will post a followup.  Otherwise, very happy.  I do notice it dies quickly when its buttons are not being pushed...I wonder if this is the \"lock up\" some talked about.  I didn't find it a problem, just hit the power button and you're good to go.  A bit disconceting vs. the Canon or Sony which stay inactive a lot longer before hibernating, but you may be able to change the setting on that if you want to.----Update after more testing-----I took it around outside in bright sun to see how it does in high light levels, also took some mroe interior shots & video trying some other situations, such as flash with high zoom level in the dark, etc.  It did very well.  You can point it at something that is so dark you can't see it, and get a perfect flash picture.  You can focus perfectly for time exposures (tripod) through moderately dirty glass at things outside.  Focus seems fast and reliable under all conditions except when you are shooting video and move to something that is significantly further away.  In that case, it is slow to refocus and the focusing makes sharp clicks on the video sound track (you're supposed to turn the AF feature to focus only at the start of the video, and not make that sort of move anyway according to the manual.)I found the focus worked fine outdoors when you were recording video and panning from far off to close up objects, also no noticeable noise.  Another defect for video is that the zoom (as others have commented) is very quick, but you can slow it down by using lighter pressure on the lever; I found the rate of zoom could be controlled to be comparable to a camcorder.  However, it has one glitch that is completely understandable for a still camera but requires some work-around for video, which is that when you have zoomed out to high levels (say 20+) and are filming, when you try to zoom back in, there is a wibble and jerk in the image as the drive connects with the lens, making the picture shake all over for a second or so.  That is about the only unexpected issue I was able to find.  There is a lot of wind noise in high wind; there is a wind noise suppression feature I didn't try.  I expect you could put a fuzz pad over the mics also if it bothered you.  All in all, I still love it and figure to take it as my sole camera on trips.  I haven't tried all the fancy scene and specialty stuff, and haven't yet loaded the Nikon software on the laptop.  I find the playback on the HDTV to be an absolute delight, and all the contols to be very intuitive and every day discover new things I like...for example, it remembers what you've been doing, and comes up with the video screen if you were shooting video, still for stills, etc.  Of course if you push the other trigger button it immediately switches.  Etc.  A million little convenient things like that.  For vacations, a neat feature is that when you have your clips displayed on the TV, as you move the zoom lever to the left it puts more and more clip thumbnails (up to 16) on the screen, and then goes to a calendar with the days for which you took shots highlighted, so it would be easy to go back after a trip and find a given subject.For battery life, it told me battery depleted when I had taken about 130 still images and 35 video clips, maybe half the stills with flash.  Probably had erased 10-15 stills and 5-10 videos.  Had about 30 minutes of video on the camera, probably.  Computer said card had 2.5 GB of files.  I had watched all the stills and video at least once on the camera display, and at least once on the TV.  So if you were just shooting, it should last significantly longer on one charge.So all in all, I give it an excellent rating.  My only real complaint is the jerking of the zoom when the retraction drive is kicked in when you are shooting video.  So I have learned to shut off the video and retract the zoom ratio before starting up the video again at the new zoom ratio if operating at high zoom ratios.  Otherwise, it pretty well exceeds every expectation.  I am delighted with it.  It's hard to imagine you can do so much photography so easily with such a tiny camera.PS: It has not \"locked up\" on me, but thanks to N Jaeger for pointing out my first night speculation about that was completely off base.. totally separate issue from the hibernation time (which you can change).  As others have said, apparently need to do a hard reboot by pulling the battery out if it does lock up.One other thing is the manual gives the data transfer rates under various uses, and the fastest is 14MB/sec for HD video, so the choice of the \"ultra\" Sandisk card (15MB/s)was probably good.  I haven't ever seen a delay in saving, processing, or shooting.  The camera indicates about 29 minutes of shooting time when you bring it up in 1080p record mode, but I can't imagine that being a limitation.  But if you wanted to set it up on a tripod and just shoot your life for the full 2 to 4 hours a big card would allow, I guess you couldn't do it.When you play a low light video back through the HDMI cable to the tv, it seems to come out enhanced and bright vs. what you see by just pulling the card and viewing it with Windows on an HP dv6 entertainment pc.  The stills and brightly lit videos look the same both ways, but apparently the camera will do some processing on data it considers suboptimal. I assume the Nikon software would do the same in the computer but haven't tried it.I remain really tickled with the camera.  Good luck.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent product. Great improvement over the P90.", "Author": "Robert Swann \"Tech Junky\"", "ReviewID": "R3FEEO4MXJQAC4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this camera. I researched several cameras before purchasing the P100 and I was not impressed with any of them.  Then I found the Nikon p90 which I thought was alright.  It had several features that I liked such as the 23x zoom and the multi-angle view finder. I was a little disappointed with the picture quality I attributed most of the poor quality to the fact that it had 12.1MP  resolution which most people will agree is only useful if you are taking pictures that you plan to enlarge into wall art.  Then I heard about the New P100 which had an even more impressive zoom at 26x and when I found out it was only 10MP and It shot 1080P HD video I was sold.  When my camera finally arrived right out of the box I was impressed with the overhauled version of the p90 they had added several useful features.  I have taken several photos so far and the problems with the p90 are gone the photo quality is amazing even in low light.  I love the facial recognition mode for up to 12 faces and the fact that the shutter releases when every one smiles.  The in camera photo editing software is decent the software for your computer is better. I have found only one flaw the battery does not last but for about 300 pictures less with the flash so it is a good idea to buy extras but they are cheap and easy to find on e-bay also it does not come with an external battery charger but again you can find it cheap.

Fantastic zoom, HDR built in, active D-lighting, effective vibration reduction, and slow motion movies.  I have nothing but praise for the P100.

Despite all of the blah-blah from the naysayers, I am in absolute awe of this little camera.  My only complaint is that compared with the P80, the P100 has put on a good bit of weight.  Still manageable though.

However I am not a novice either.  After 4 months of regular usage of my Canon SX20is, I noticed a small white dead pixel in my HD video recordings and having a 3 year extended warranty repair plan, the camera has gone back for repairs (an extended warranty is definitely a good idea when dealing with electronic items with moving parts).  I returning my Canon to the electronics retailer I initially purchased it from for repairs and I was told I could take advantage of a \"loaner\" camera for a 30 day period.  I simply needed to purchase another camera and return it for a full refund within the 30 days.  I was excited to hear I could take advantage of trying a new Nikon Coolpix P100 and compare it to my Canon.  It's been 2 weeks now, and I am looking forward to returning this Nikon and getting my Canon back!  I was seriously considering keeping the Nikon.  After all, Nikon is a big name in photography as is Canon, but after putting this Nikon through the \"ringer\" in the last 2 weeks, I don't see the value in it, considering it costs just as much (if not slightly more) than the Canon.  There are 2 major drawbacks to the Nikon compared to the Canon.  The first being the ability to add on accessories and the second being the HD video recording capability.  The Nikon does not have a hotshoe attachment for an auxiliary flash unit and no ability to add uv and polarizing lens filters and lens protectors.  It also does not have the ability to add a lens hood to help in certain lighting situations.  The Nikon 3\" lcd screen is nice and large, well lit, sharp and colorful, but it only pivots on a horizontal axis.  The Canon lcd being 2.7 inches is slightly smaller and equally as sharp and colorful, extends out to the left of the camera and swings completely 360 degrees allowing the user to actually point the lcd forward for those situations you'd like to videotape yourself.  The Canons lcd can also be flipped on it's protective hard-shelled backside and tucked neatly into the back of the camera protecting the lcd screen.  You can't do that with the Nikon.  The lcd screen is always exposed and open to dust, dirt, fingerprints, and possible mechanical damage to the screen.  Both cameras have viewfinders, but I find the Nikon's is more pixelated and not as sharp as the Canon's.  The Nikon's 26X zoom is hardly much better than the Canon's 20X zoom, and the readout on the lcd screen on the Nikon simply goes from \"W\" to \"T\" (wide angle to telephoto) whereas the Canon will actually display a reading of 10X, 20X, 25X to 80X as the telephoto extends (of course 80X incorporating digital zoom).  It's attention to detail like this in the Canon that sets it apart from the Nikon.  When it comes to picture quality, it is really hard to differentiate.  On occasion I've gotten blurry and out-of-focus pictures on both.  However they both can take some fantastic photos.  The Nikon's CMOS \"backside\" illumination system is a 10.3 megapixel system.  Pic sizes on the \"fine\" setting are around 3600x2700 at 300 dpi.  The Canon's 12.1 megapixel system produces pictures at it's largest size of 4000x3000 and at 180 dpi.  Again, it's really hard to tell the difference in picture quality when comparing the two side by side.  The power source in the Nikon is a lithium ion rechargeable.  A small rectangular sized battery that completely charges from empty in about 3.5 hours.  The Canon requires 4X AA sized batteries.  I've been using a good set of Sanyo Enloop and Energizer Nimh batteries which require anywhere from 15-20 hours to fully recharge (depending on the mah battery ratings).  However, the best I've managed on the Nikon is about 250 pictures before a recharge it required.  The AA's in the Canon have gotten me well over 400 and still going!  The HD video mode in the Nikon is said to be 1080p where the Canon's is 720p. Now I understand some people don't care for video recording, but if you're going to advertise it, better be able to deliver the goods.  Again, it's hard to tell the two apart, but here's the real deal breaker.  The auto focus in the Nikon in the HD mode is terrible.  Anything beyond 60 feet telephoto is a blur.  The continuous image stabilization system in the Canon is far more reliable and usable even at full telephoto.  In the Nikon, forget about it!  I've seen better video out of a $100 Kodak pocket camera than this Nikon!  The Canon's stereo mics are situated facing forward towards the subject in the lens whereas the Nikon's stereo mics are situated pointing up towards the photographer.  What's the deal?  Does Nikon want to get you to hear the photographers heavy breathing??  Here's another thing to consider.  Although my Canon is currently in for repairs, during the first 2 weeks of using this Nikon I've had multiple \"error\" messages and have had the lens lock out on me 4 or 5 times in the process of taking pictures (had to power off the camera and power back on).  I've NEVER had an error message with the Canon and NEVER a locked lens at zoom.  Also, it may take the Canon slightly longer to focus (a fraction of a second or two) but there isn't a violent shake in the telephoto as is evident in the Nikon (at zoom it's blurry and when you have your target in range you need to actively press the focus button to focus on the subject and engage the \"vibration reduction\" system).  In the end, the Nikon's \"vibration reduction\" system is sub-par when compared to the Canon's \"image stabilization\" (imo).  There are a couple of other nice little features with the Nikon.  You have the ability to record in high speed video at 240 fps, but what good is that when most of the time when the focus system doesn't work and the picture has a lot more shake at zoom?  When it comes down to it, the Nikon doesn't hold much value when compared to the Canon at around the same price point.  I liken this Nikon to a rental car and my Canon a \"Cadillac\" while it's in the shop for servicing.  It's (the Nikon) is fun to beat around with, but not something you'd like to have as a fancy daily driver.  And one more point to consider (and this may be relevant for many people when it comes to electronics), the Nikon is made in Indonesia.  The Canon is made in Japan!", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wish quality matched the feature set", "Author": "N. Jaeger", "ReviewID": "R2R3JCK9TZ9Q17", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My recent luck with the Nikon Coolpix series has convinced me that Nikon quality just isn't what it once was. I was looking to replace my Coolpix 7900, an absolutely terrific point and shoot which unfortunately met its demise in a puddle of spilled orange juice, with a mega-zoom.  I picked up a P90 a few months ago (non-Amazon purchase), but ended up returning it after about a month because of sporadic Lens Error messages, where the lens would just stop moving or focusing for no apparent reason. By the time I returned it I had heard that the P100 wasn't far off, and I wanted to give Nikon another chance because I was so happy with the old 7900.I ordered the P100 from Amazon as soon as it came out, and I must admit that I was impressed with it at first.  The feature set on this camera is terrific.  The continuous shooting mode works well, the night landscape mode produced some good results, and the camera focused very quickly.  The image quality is decent.  Although the pictures do sometimes come out on the soft side, they have a very natural, unprocessed look.  The high speed video shooting is pretty fun, producing some cool clips even though it only records in VGA or less in this mode.  The HD video is also decent.  You need a Class 6 card to avoid choppiness when shooting 1080p, but 720p worked fine with a Class 4 card.  All around, this camera is a fairly big step up from the P90.So why the two-star rating then?  Because the camera locks up.  And not just occasionally, but fairly frequently.  I have been taking pictures here and there almost every day since getting the camera over two weeks ago, and it locks up almost once a day.  It becomes completely unresponsive, and the battery needs to be removed to recover. It seems like this happens in bunches too; it will usually happen two or three times in a row and then be fine for a while.  Given that this is a fairly high-end point-and-shoot, this sort of thing just isn't tolerable.Given my issues with first the P90, and now the P100, along with other P100 reviews describing similar locking issues, I have decided not only to return the camera but to give up on Nikon as well.  I wanted to like this camera and I really did when it was working, but I now have serious doubts about Nikon quality.I just ordered the Sony HX1 today, and hopefully this one will work out.  Yes it's nearly an entire year older, but at least there were plenty of reviews, most of them quite good.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "We love it when it works!", "Author": "T.

As owners of a D70s, my wife and I were looking for something lighter and more versatile to reduce fighting over the D70s.  The P100 neatly fits that bill, with caveats.  Most of the nice features have already been covered so I'll be negative!  First, ours locked up once on the three day trip.  On/off was non-responsive, even after holding it down 10 seconds, so we hard reset by removing the battery.  It was fine after that.  Second, the HD video is neat if you want a camera that can occasionally shoot some video, but is NOT sufficient if you want to shoot a good amount of video as well as take some photos.  It shot 1080p just fine on a class 6 memory card, though to be honest I would happily sacrifice resolution if the video were more responsive or customizable.With a wide angle lens on our D70s, the P100 handily accomplished everything else, capturing wildlife shots (sports mode was helpful), zoom shots, and macro (i.e., wildflowers).  The zoom is particularly nice.  For fun, I zoomed in all the way and snapped a photo of a passing 747.  A bit fuzzy (no amount of VR was going to save me, standing in a decent wind & shooting straight up), but it's something we certainly don't have the lens to tackle with our SLR.  To be able to go from 30,000' to decent macro shots on a whim is certainly convenient and creates its own opportunities.All around we like the P100 so far.  The obvious problem with the lens locking up drops it down a star.  I suppose I could drop it to 3 stars for the HD video, but we never expected we would get fantastic HD video from a camera.  When we get our replacement I'll be sure to come back and kill the rating if its lens also locks up!EDIT: Our second P100 has now experience the lens lockup as well.  We still love this camera when it works, but I've dropped it another star.  We'll exchange it and try again with one more unit before we give up.  I'm not willing to hold on to a camera that has a crappy lens motor/software less than 60 days after we bought it -- twice!

I charged the battery and started taking a few pictures with it around the house the first night. They were ok. I used the auto setting with and without the flash.

After going through a series of combinations, I was able to get good photos when camera is programmed changing eV settings and using the \"vivid\" option. However, the quality is not as good as my Panasonic FZ18 which produces better color saturation on the auto intelligent setting. The continuous shooting setting is impressive if I ever get the opportunity to use it. I like the sliding LCD screen and the camera is really fast when you don't use auto setting.  The zoom is impressive.VideoThis feature I am very disappointed due to the following:Image is out of focus every time you use the zoom.I don't like the quick time video format. I don't have an apple computer. This is a huge problem if you like to edit. The only way to a view good video is by connecting it to a HD TV or on a computer.  I like to edit my videos and make a DVD .  I was hoping the quality would be good enough to use one camera on my trips, leaving my Panasonic tape DV camcorder at home.  No can do. The DVD's contain much more noise than a normal DVD .Most of the videos are too bright, probably the result of poor auto white balance design. There is no way to change the light balance in the video mode.The image shake setting does not work very well.

The camera's performance has been great.  Macro shots are nothing short of amazing in detail, the auto-mode performs much better than I expected across the range, and the anti-blurring capabilities work very well all the way to full optical zoom. (Adding digital zoom defeats it however... need a tripod for that)Color replication is good in all modes, though it has a tendency to \"wash\" vivid hues in circumstances where the entire shot is made of similar colors (trees, grass, weeds, bushes across a field etc) but easily correctable. Night time shots have always been my bane but the P100 does so well in these circumstances that I actually switched back to auto mode and let the camera make the decisions. I have not tried the video mode.  The only negatives I have are trivial.  The door to the charge/upload slots feels flimsy and the Nikon software is slow to handle uploads to my Mac.

The P100 also has different flash settings you can take advantage of and they work. I will say neither of these were important to me when I bought it because I did not think it would be able to do either. I bought it as I think many people did for the long range zoom, I would like to report that even adding the digital zoom which extends the 26x zoom x 4 I have gotten amazingly clear shots using available optical stabilization and mechanical stabilization while being hand held and in the fast action mode. I can also get steady handhelds when in all manual settings at or near the optical zoom limits. I have owned the Rebel XT DSLR for years and have  acquired many lenses and a pretty good idea of how to use it. I simply got tired of lugging 30lbs. of equipment with me and the specs on the P100 are incredible for what it is. I can tell you if you really want a true point and shoot this is not it! The color saturation and blurriness of trying to use it strictly as an auto will drive you crazy as it is mostly worthless. I found that with patience and a clear understanding of the manual along with the different shooting modes, you can capture some fine pictures.I have experienced many of the same problems as with DSLR cameras with a CMOS sensor and multiple shooting modes, while many of the zoom point and shoots do not encourage you to have to learn about cameras because their auto features are really good this Nikon P100 works much like a DSLR camera where its up to you to take great pictures, the controls are there for you so go out and enjoy this one as I am.Well it has been 9 days since my initial impression and I have taken well over 500 pictures.

The press from Nikon (who have really let me down with this one) suggests you can switch to video from any shooting mode, which is technically true - but you don't retain any of the features of that shooting mode. There is not a way to turn off auto-metering and auto-white balancing when you're shooting video, and both of them are hypersensitive - which means that any time something or someone enters or leaves frame, the camera freaks out and flashes through different colors and brightnesses (and the clicking of the adjustments also shows up in the audio).

Now the lens barrel, my God, if you shake the camera , even lightly, the lens would just keep hitting its lens barrel inside as if there was something loosed in it.  Without a doubt, I returned it, and ordered a Lumix DMC-FZ35, since its got much better professional reviews with more positive feedback, and at a much cheaper price.  I don't mind the Lumix's not so stellar zoom range when its only 18X, for me, image quality is the most important factor for keeping or returning a camera, among everything else.  And the P100, while having so many great features built-in, is a let down.

Gift For You \"SK\"", "ReviewID": "R1SJ396SMODA6X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used a Sony point and shoot for eight years and thought that maybe it is the time to switch to something fancier but not dSLR yet.  Therefore, after studying the available options, I narrowed it down to Nikon P100, Canon SX20IS, and Lumix FZ40. The Canon was a good candidate but a little on the heavy side. The Lumix had some color issues and I decided on the Nikon. So far, I love it. It is light, full of features and gives you a lot of manual tuning to play with. The menu and controls are just perfect. After studying the manual, I started shooting Auto then in priority modes and even in manual modes for experimenting (you can see some of my pics in the customers photos in amazon). The video is also nice but you can hear a buzz sound from the zoom if used (not as loud as you might think like the Fuji ones, but you can hear it especially if you are filming in a quite environment). I think it is a very good option for someone who wants to move from the point and shoot but still not at the dSLR point yet. I guess it is a keeper for me and will only buy dSLR after this one (after mastering the manual shooting). I am still learning, but quite impressed after 3 weeks of using it.  As you see below, most of the Cons (in my opinion) are minor and i can live with them.To summarize:Pros:- Good build (sturdy), ergonomic and very light.- Excellent powerful zoom.- Very nice macro shots.- Great menu and options can be easily reached.- Nice pictures and colors.- High speed continuous shooting at 10MP! wow!!!- High speed video recording (it is fun).- View finder, which comes handy in direct sunlight situations.- The LCD, which tilts up and down by 90 deg, is quite handy in several situations.Cons:- A little noise in low light or with high ISO, which is normal for non-dSLR I guess. But you can always limit the ISO in the settings (which is nice).- Slight zoom sound in the video recording.- No RAW (which is weird!!! why would Nikon take RAW off this magnificent camera?).- No remote shutter (again, why would not Nikon consider having a remote for this camera???)- Cannot install standard filters on the lens. That would have been really a BIG plus if Nikon allowed it to.- I would loved if the manual focus was done using the command dial instead of the multi selector.UPDATE (11/10/2010): I have returned the camera today. I found out that the noise level was bothering me more. Add to that no RAW means wasting more time touching and fixing the images. Also, since I was interested in landscape images, I wanted the freedom of having filters and remote shutter. This is still a great camera, but not for the things I will use it or need it for. I am trying SX30IS and will write a review about it in the next couple weeks.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love my camera", "Author": "Debbie Stein", "ReviewID": "R179E0JGSX6TUL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had it for a few months now and I have to say that I love my new camera.

I took it out of the box, installed the battery, turned it on and tried a couple of test pictures.  One was wide-angle, the other using the 26x zoom.  Both pictures turned out great.  I didn't have much time to play with it, so I turned it off and went about my other business.  I came back to the camera about an hour later and turned it on, nothing, couldn't get the zoom to work, nothing.  I turned it off, back on and still nothing.  I took out the battery and put it back in and the camera went nuts!!  The zoom kept going in and out, in and out, in and out and finally stayed out and I got an error message on the screen stating that I need to take off the lens cap!!  There was not a lens cap on the camera and I had not ever put the lens cap on the camera!!!  I decided maybe the battery needed to be charged so I hooked up the camera to the battery charger and charged it for 3 hours.  I came back to the camera in 3 hours, removed the battery charger, same thing--zoom went crazy!!! Going in and out, in and out and telling me to remove the lens cap.  I packed the entire thing back in the box and today printed out the return slip.  I am going to return the darned thing for an exchange and try one more time.  If the second one does this or anything else that it shouldn't do, I am through with Nikon.  I have a Nikon Coolpix 5600 that I carry in my purse and it has taken some pretty good pics.  I had such high hopes for the P100 but they just got dashed to the four winds.  If I have to return a second one, I may go with Kodak again, that is mostly what I have had in the digital line of cameras and they have been pretty good.----------------Did not receive a replacement from Amazon, but ordered a new one from another vendor.  It was shipped on Friday and arrived on Saturday.  So far, this one works as it should.  I have turned it off and on several times and it works each time.  I should have suspected the first one was defective when I used the zoom the first time and it zoomed all the way out when I touched the zoom button!!  This one is giving me some very good pictures indoors with just the room lights and no flash. The macro is fantastic--I sat on the sofa and took a shot of some flowers about 7 feet away and they are clear as a bell.  Can't wait to check it out on a trip.

I just returned from my vacations, with almost 1500 of me and my kids on the south of Chile and Argentina (all forests, mountains and lakes, 10 lakes to choose from in case you do not know the region). I took pictures and videos, using all the possible combinations of settings, full zoom, scenes, etc etc. The colors are full and vivids on my Sony Bravia TV (and my parents LG). All the skies, water, flowers, snow peaks, grass, tree covered mountains look exactly as I remember them, considering that the landscapes you see there are truly breathtaking. The full HD videos looks great. I did not have any freezing or problem like that, at all.My only complains : the latch covering the battery and SD card tends to pop open if you are not careful with your fingers. Not good. A spare battery is a must. Twice I ran out of power, both times I could get a USB port nearby to charge a little. The menus are not the best, some options appear and dissapear depending on the scene you have selected, but you get used to them quickly.The visor is not great but is a big help for sunny days. Funnily, I met several tourists using this same model (argentinians, a spaniard couple and other couple from Montana).

In fact, they're so good that I've found myself carrying it around instead of my Nikon D80 SLR, which leads to the reason for my 4-star instead of 5-star rating. There are 2 features missing that make it just a little less than ideal as an all-purpose camera.  I almost always carry a polarizing filter for my D80 and use it regularly for outdoor photos with that camera.  There is apparently no way to use a filter of any kind with the P100.  The other omission is a provision for using a remote control or cable release, which I would like for those occasions when I use a tripod to minimize vibrations. If I'm mistaken about either the filters or the remote, or if anyone knows of work-arounds, I would appreciate being informed.  Otherwise, I really like the 26mm equivalent wide-angle end of the zoom range, but I find the power zoom lever difficult to use for fine-tuning the zoom.  Even with the lightest touch, it almost always overshoots the setting I wanted.  I also like the bright and tiltable display monitor, although as an old-school guy I usually look through the electronic viewfinder, which is somewhat low-resolution like an old VGA display.

camera settings for several of the images. First, if you buy or are leaning in that direction, I implore you to READ THE MANUAL even if you don't normally read manuals. Its 200 pages and well written, packed with easy to understand how-to. If you skip doing that you might miss discovering many features you may not otherwise stumble on except by accident if ever.If you're in the market for a HD video camera this Nikon model might be all you need plus you get great digital photographs as a bonus. If you main interest is having a digital camera to take still photos, the P100 can produce high quality video in several modes: lower resolution HD at 1280x720, VGA 640x480 and QVGA 320x24 depending on speed settings plus full HD at 1920x1080. There's a neat little button/slider switch to set the camera to video mode. For the special effects (slower/faster speed) you need to set to HS, press the red button, wait for the REC confirmation on the LCD screen, then press the OK button to begin shooting at different speed otherwise you're just shooting at normal speed at lower resolution.The camera comes with software called ViewNX which makes it very easy to transfer both photos and videos to your computer for further processing. You can also do slideshows just with the camera or step through the images and videos. A nice notation feature allows you to make up to 20 second 'audio notes' for files that have a musical note sign (most formats do). You can play the vocal notes you recorded back while the file is still in the camera by just depressing one button or while in ViewNx. Don't like what you said, delete and try again. This feature carries over when you transfer files to a computer creating a .wav file with the same file name as the image.When using ViewNX I discovered by accident that JPEG files by default are compressed to about 80% of their shot compression value to save space when transferring to your computer. This can be easily changed so no extra compression happens which would reduce image quality, which I think is self-defeating. I suggest you make no additional compression your default option if you use ViewNX as your software of choice to transfer files to your computer. This software also shows a wealth of file information like date shot, modified, image quality, zoom, focal length, F/stop, etc., plus there's space to add personal notes like contact, description, key words, tags, a whole bunch of stuff that makes it handy. There's quite a few features in this better than average image viewer software. Be sure to check the built-in help for more features.OK, some of the nitty gritty... I won't cover everything, that would take forever, just some features I found interesting I didn't see others touch on in awhile.First, some reviewers suggest the photos aren'ts as sharp as other 10 MPX cameras. Well, yes and no. That's really subjective. Really depends on your settings. If you mainly want to print out 8X10 or smaller photos the sharpness is more than enough except for the real diehard purist crowd that thumb their noses at anything less than DSLR output. If the images are a bit soft for your tastes and you're sure it isn't because you're in one of the many override modes that alter auto settings (common error) you can sharpen and use more vivid settings which boosts contrast and adjust brightness and other things. Its well covered in the manual. Another reason I strongly suggest you read the entire manual, even if you do it in bits and pieces.Word of caution:If you have reasonable post production skills and know your way around Photoshop or similar image enhancement software for most images I wouldn't tweak with in-camera adjustments as to levels, contrast, you can do better (assuming you know how) using Photoshop, similar software. However sharpness and picking a vivid mode can make a noticeable difference as can ISO, and other settings.I really like how many choices you get to view images. You can click on a image in ViewNX, hold left mouse button down, changes to hand and you can zoom in to see details. Probably better is the Crop feature build into the camera electronics. Pick any image, give the W/T button a nudge all the way towards \"T\" and you now can zoom in on the photo using the left,right,up,down arrow keys. You'll be surprised how useful this is considering you can zoom in, effectively cropping the image and save that portion as a new file. Nice!Depending on what mode (look for a ?)you're in you can also access a simple help system that displays in the LCD monitor. Nice, while you're learning how to use the camera's many features. By the way, the P100 has a large three inch adjustable brightestness LCD monitor that pulls away from the camera and can be titled up and down making it easy to take those more difficult shots. It uses a beefy 640,000 pixel anti-glare screen. A simple switch lets you switch between this LCD monitor and a electronic view finder as your primary aiming device. A handy button allows to change what you see in the LCD. You can view most of the settings you selected on screen and also a usefule grid that divides the screen into nine sections, making it easy to follow one of photography's golden rules; \"Rule of Thirds\" If you're not familar with this, please LEARN, it can help you take more interesting pictures by properly framing the shot.If you have a HD TV that has HDMI input, get a HDMI to USB mini c cable. Not an absolute must, but the quality gets raised to the wow factor for slide shows and HD video playback because it stays digital all the way and there is no analog processing of the video or audio.A few other goodies that deserve mention. The sports continuous mode is GREAT if you're into sports, shooting your kids, etc.. It takes a series of stills in rapid sequence, you just push the shutter once and sit back. The result is slow to extra slow motion when played back depending on settings. Hint: if you're into video editing like I am and have decent software, this is a real boon in that you can really expand on this feature. Then there's subject tracking mode. You pick a \"target\" the camera \"locks on\" and keeps moving objects focused. Nice! Too many options to go into a detail here but I will say the various continous modes give crisp results even at very high shutter speeds.AF area mode is great for people that aren't that great taking pictures. It can automatically detect and focus on a face or a group of faces. Unlike some cameras that will only focus on the center of the frame you can manually focus anywhere in the frame in 99 steps. Has smile and blink detection too like many newer cameras do these days. Also worth noting are features that can take a series of pictures then the camera can select the best one, like when nobody blinked, or very nice for low light shots where in another mode five images are taken then automatically combined to capture the most highlights and details from shadows then combining into one \"improved\" picture. That's cool!There's much more to discover, why I'll repeat READ THE WHOLE MANUAL, you'll be glad you did.There are a few minor cons. The camera is too big to carry around in your pocket, a purse for the ladies, sure. It doesn't come with a case, again not a big deal. Two slightly annoying things are for this price range you'd think they would throw in a memory card, no, again, most companies don't either. The one real disapointment is it takes a good 3.5 hours to charge the battery. Worse to do it, the battery remains in the camera and you need to use the supplied USB cable. Amazon has extra batteries and a AC and even a car based charger. I got to get that. ;-) There's a silver lining is this USB feature. You can charge up you camera by simply plugging it in your USB port on your computer or laptop.A few things I wish the P100 had, but don't would be option to add your own flash attachment, though the build-in works fine for me so far. Also would be nice to have a option to plug in a cable shutter release. This comes in handy if you want tack sharp photos, just pushing the shutter down to fire the camera (any camera) can introduce a tad of vibration as any pro photographer will tell you, which is why a plug-in shutter release would be useful to insure razor sharp images, more so if you have heavy fingers pushing the trigger. The zoom feature only uses a slider scale to show how far you've zoomed in. OK, but no reading to let you know how far you've zoomed so each time is an adventure and a bit different. The battery indicator doesn't show how much battery strength is left. It doesn't show at all, until just before the battery is almost totally discharged. While minor, hope all these little annoyances will be addressed in future models. All in all the P100 is really a nice camera for beginner, serious hobbyist even pros that don't want to drag around some bulky DSLR and all its lens and attachements everywhere every day.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bought it, used it for macro, returned it (poor quality pictures)!", "Author": "Dr. Eugene L.

However, quite a few said that the optics DO NOT create sharp macro photos. I used the camera for 3 days, took lots of pictures in my garden area of flowers and bugs. The pictures were not sharp!!!! I decided to return it and, instead, bought a Sony Cybershot HX-1. It's much better! I love the moveable 3\" LCD and close-ups are great!

I purchased both - the vendor has a \"no questions\" 90 return policy - and decided to keep the Nikon because of the weight factor and the extra zoom. Then we went on a \"one in a life time\" vacation. I soon discovered: 1) the grid lines will only show in Program mode; 2) if you composed a shot of mountains with foothills in the foreground you see a BEAUTIFUL shot when the shutter is pressed halfway and then NO MOUNTAINS in the picture as they are washed out. You have to center the view on the sky behind the mountain, hold the shutter button half down to compose the shot and then complete the picture taking. Canon's averaging approach (with my pocket camera) produced fantastic shots with no difficulty. It is something needing to be learned but not expected in a camera costing this much.  I NEVER saw a low battery indicator. The camera would just quit without warning. Luckiy I had purchased a generic battery to carry as a backup. I tried taking pictures of the Alaska sunsets ... washed out on the \"sunset\" setting. Finally tried \"night shot\" and got decent sunsets at midnight. I suggest you wait until they upgrade the zoom and finder on the Canon and get a camera you can put filters on and that gives consistently good exposures at the settings you would expect.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good, but took it back", "Author": "C. Conrey \"audio guy\"", "ReviewID": "R39EAZ1K7RM3Z2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Feature wise the camera has everything you could want from a P&S; in a form factor that is better suited to my hands than the small flat Canon. Only had it a weak before returning it because of poor implementation:1) The zoom is WAY too fast with a non-functional \"slow\" mode. As a result it is impossible to crop to what you really want. If you are patient and shooting an inanimate object you might eventually get there but it is not suitable for moving subjects (kids). The Canon SX20 and Sony have MUCH smoother zoom control.2) This is a P&S; camera with DSLR type controls. With that in mind I was happy with the picture quality. However, one of the DSLR controls I was after was manual focus. Unfortunately, they way they implemented it is very clumsy and awkward (and again, not smooth control). If you don't need manual focus then this is not an issue.3) The final straw came when the auto focus locked up. I had taken a number of pictures w/out a problem so the light was ok. Once in this mode nothing I changed (zoom, flash, Auto mode) would fix it. I had to turn it off and take out the battery. It started working after that, but I need something first and foremost that is reliable.I really wanted this camera to work and really liked the way is fits in my hands - kind of a small version of my D40x. But I took it back and am looking for something else.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Below Expectation", "Author": "A. Sutono, a.k.a., Birdey The Observer", "ReviewID": "R268N6PY984Q4I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Despite seemingly superior specifications in some respects to its peers, Nikon P100's image quality is somewhat dissapointing, particularly when the camera operates in one of the pre-defined settings to take outdoor photographs  Their pre-set modes; auto and portrait work OK for indoor objects, but the quality is poor when taking panoramic pictures. So most of the time, I have to manually adjust the shutter speed, ISO and aperture. But then it appears the minimum aperture of F8.0 is inadequate to produce a high-quality outdoor scenic photographs. When running in the manual mode, though I don't expect the step between two shutter speeds to be continuous, it is still too large for speeds greater than 1/100s. For example, between 1/400s to 1/1000s, there are only three intermediate options, 1/500, 1/640, and 1/800s. It is also a little cumbersome to change the ISO setting since you have to go to the menu.What is most annoying, however, is the software applications. I don't understand why there needs to be two separate applications; Nikon Transfer to transfer the photos to your PC and View NX to view and manage the photos. I have to admit, the details given in View NX is impressive where for each photo, it tells you the camera settings with which it was taken. But another annoying problem is that when the applications are running, they seem to take up a lot of memory and slow the system down. The data transfer between the camera and the PC is also slow. I thought it's USB2.0 running at least 12MBps and theoretically can be as fast as 480Mbps, but my observation is it is a lot less than 1Mbps. It might be because I'm running them on an old laptop, but it is hard to buy this argument since other applications including my old Kodak Easy Share runs much faster and doesn't slow the system down.So I have to say, while pricing-wise, P100 is affordable compared to other brands with the same or even greater optical zoom, but its performance doesn't live up to my expectations. Don't buy it if you don't enjoy playing with dials and knobs on the camera when trying to get an optimum configuration on the picture you're taking.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "OK, but a little disappointed", "Author": "B.

My conclusion is that the camera is fine for an amateur - like me - interested in pictures that require extra optical zoom.Pros:Lens are superb, quality of pictures in general is above all previous Sony cameras I've been using (including Sony H10 with Carl Weiss lens);Zoom system is great, it is fast to zoom in or out, but it can be difficult to focus in extreme telephoto. If you don't have a tripod, try vibration reduction to \"hybrid\" position, it works well. I took beautiful pictures of The Moon with and without a tripod;Scene modes work well if you don't like to lose time setting things in a camera. Panorama Assist is gorgeous - you can easily shoot many beautiful panoramas. Stitch the pictures in the software that comes with the CD;HD movie has VERY good quality, but it requires a lot of battery and SD card space;White Balance works very well in most situations, you can let it in automatic setting, except under incandescent light (yellow light);Electronic viewfinder is great when shooting in sunny outdoors, you can see perfectly the scenario while saving battery life;Flash is very good and fast and works well if the subject is until 20 feet away from the camera. When using flash I set white balance to \"Flash\", it is better than to \"Automatic\".Cons:As sensor seems to be very responsive to light, shutter speed tends to be very fast and colors tend to be pale in sunny outdoors. It is better to set exposure compensation to positive side (+EV). It is better to work with color optimization: \"vivid\" is fine for most situations. When shooting people, I took better results setting optimization to \"Normal\" or \"Soft\";At night, the sensor tends to slow down shutter speed excessively, so it is better to set exposure compensation to negative side (- EV). Set noise reduction to \"on\", otherwise your sky will seem much more light grey than black;Menus are terrible, I can't believe someone can find easy to change settings with this camera. In general it is better to set things to automatic, but I prefer to set a low ISO value, it is better for picture quality;Battery life is mediocre, YOU NEED a spare one (maybe 2) if you intend to stay all day long shooting pictures and movies.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "An excellent camera for the money", "Author": "golf guy", "ReviewID": "R2JYG10A4YBZ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the perfect cross over from the very simple point and shoots to a DSLR.

I'm also impressed with the image quality of photos taken with flash.  Not something I expected at all from any point and shoot camera.  Other thoughts:  LCD provides a great view, though I wish it was truly articulating (like Canon) as opposed to just flipping up and down; good mix of manual controls on camera and easy to access and understand menus; the camera seems a bit cheap to me overall (lens kind of rattles), but it is not that bad; it would have been nice to have a battery charger included, but not a deal breaker.You do have to remember, with this or any superzoom, that you are limited by small sensor.  Camera is basically useless in low light without flash, and overall image quality will not compare to pricier, less zoomy point and shoots like Panasonic LX5 or Canon S95 or Canon G12 or Nikon P7000.  But for what you pay and presumably why you buy a superzoom -- the zoom -- the P100 is a nice value.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon P100", "Author": "avocet \"avocet\"", "ReviewID": "R2LRPL8HLSZSMV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lightweight, easy to use, camera which allows we inexperienced photographers some feel as to features available in more expensive equipment.

Nonetheless I was able (because of my experience in photography) to judge the camera fairly. I was also able to determine the cause of some problems others have experienced.Several owners have registered complaints about the camera \"locking\" when they have zoomed out and needing to turn the camera off before it will retract. I suspect this is because the user was employing the digital zoom feature of the camera. I have experienced this same problem with the digital zoom in other point-and-shoot cameras including the Canon PowerShot SX20 (one of which I own also). Digital zoom is software, not hardware. Like other software it sometimes hits a \"glitch\" and might cause the hardware to malfunction, just as computer software sometimes does to the computer. Other digital point-and-shoot cameras with digital zoom have the feature as an option to be activated in the setup menu. The Nikon CoolPix P100 have the digital zoom feature on by default. It can be deactivated in the setup menu.Some owners have mentioned that the photos from this camera are \"washed out\". The Nikon CoolPix P100 does, indeed, tend to produce results lighter in color than the subject. There is an \"Exposure Compensation\" feature that enables the user to adjust to darken or lighten the exposure. It is accessed by pressing the right side of the Multi Selector and is adjusted by pressing \"up\" or \"down\" as needed. Unless you are using the \"Auto\" mode the setting you choose will remain after turning off the camera.The design of the lens cap leaves something to be desired. Rather than being on the lens it is snapped onto the camera body. This is the cause of \"Lens Error\" messages and potentially camera damage. When the camera is turned on the lens automatically extends about \u00bc inch. If the lens cap has not been removed it is physically impossible for the lens to make this initial, automatic, extension. Hence the error message. Hence potential damage to the camera.The camera seems rather sensitive. My hand accidentally came in contact with the side of the lens when extended which resulted in an instant \"lens error\" message and instructions to remove the lens cap and turn the camera off and back on. However, I was able to take my photo with neither \"corrective action\" being taken.The barrel of the lens housing is tapered. This makes the camera somewhat difficult to hold when steadying it during macro shots or shots made in low light. All my other cameras (Canon ((including a DSLR)) and Fuji) have straight barrels.I have not tried the video feature of the camera nor will I. I prefer to use an actual video camera.I installed the portion of the software for downloading that came with the camera. It didn't work. This is not a problem for me because I prefer to remove the memory stick and read it with my card reader.I use all my cameras extensively. It remains to be seen if the Nikon CoolPix P100 becomes my point-and-shoot of choice.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon Breakdown", "Author": "Disappointed Dad", "ReviewID": "R1CV0CMUAFHBAK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My wife and I purchased this camera due to the Nikon reputation, the many features, and the 26x zoom - to be used for an African safari to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. Neither of us are photographers or that knowledgeable when it comes to photography so we wanted a fairly easy-to-use camera.  The Coolpix 100 did not disappoint us!  I read the operating manual prior to the trip and got familiar with the camera's features, modes, and settings and we got many, hundreds, of fantastic photos. So the zoom and overall picture quality was very good.The downside, immediately upon use the camera would \"lock\" up - something I saw written in other reviews.  And to resolve, had to remove the battery and reinsert and boot up.  This happened during our first safari - a major problem when eying what should be a memorable shot.The second and more recent issue, after about a year's ownership, is that the screen image goes out and is replaced with a grainy, \"negative film type\" image - sorry but that's the best I can describe it.  At times it would go away and the normal image would re-appear after moving the screen around a bit, but now it seems locked in this awful image.  Alternative is to use the viewfinder which is not my preference.  Doubtful if it is worth sending to Nikon for repair as the camera is out of warranty, or simply look for a newer model with similar features that we enjoy.

I have an Olympus Pen E-PL1 that I am very pleased with, but I wanted a do-it-all camera with a lot of zoom. I like that it has a EVF, even though it's not very good, and the tilt LCD is a nice feature. I mostly bought this over some other models because of the back lit CMOS sensor. I was expecting better image quality, and I am relatively pleased. I believe most reviewers on here bashing this camera for image quality have unreasonable expectations. It is still a P&S; camera, not a DSLR.The indoor/poor lighting image quality is actually better than I expected. The 1080p video is nice, and the camera does an adequate job keeping focus, even though there is some lag when zooming in or out. The zoom works well, and it is possible to get good shots without a tripod when at full zoom, thanks to the VR. Manual controls are nice, and user friendly.My main problem with this camera is the quality of the build. Although it's a good size, and lightweight, it just feels cheap. The lens is sloppy, rattles when you shake the camera. Because of the play in the lens assembly, there is some sag when at full extension. Like others, I have experienced 2 lens errors, but have not had a hard lock up, and have not had to pull the battery. The lens error seems to happen after shooting video, then going back to shooting photos, it stops responding, then generates an error message, thinking the lens cap might be on.I just updated the firmware from V1.0 to V1.2, and I will edit this review later if this resolves the lens error problem. There is one fix in  the V1.1 update that sounds like it could resolve the issue. As far as the firmware update, that's a little disappointing also. You must have a SD card reader to move the file from your PC to the  SD Card, you cannot move it to the card via the camera. I was able to update the firmware for my Pen online, a much simpler process.Here is the firmware update fixes:[Version 1.2]\"When the monitor was turned on by pressing the power switch or shutter-release button, or by rotating the mode dial, after the camera had entered standby mode with the auto off function with the Welcome screen set to any option other than None (default setting), monitor display was completely black with only information displayed.  Further, when the shutter-release button was pressed halfway with this monitor display, the view through the lens was displayed, but the display included a significant amount of noise.\"[Version 1.1]* Distortion control and Auto bracketing can now be enabled at the same time.* An issue that caused light sources to appear green with continuous shooting in Night landscape scene mode has been resolved.* When the camera was turned on by pressing the playback button with the mode dial set to \"U\" (user setting mode), and the MENU button then pressed, an error message was displayed.  This issue has been resolved.* An issue that prevented the zoom from operating when the zoom control was pressed in the \"T\" direction and then immediately pressed in the \"W\" direction has been resolved.* An issue that prevented the shutter speed display from blinking when the shutter speed specified with the mode dial set to \"S\" would result in under-exposure has been resolved.I have owned several cameras from different manufacturers, and this is the poorest build quality I've seen. This is my first, and probably last Nikon. For what I paid for it, and for what I need it for, it will do the job.

That is what the diopter does; this feature lets you focus within the view finder without using your glasses or bifocals.And whats more; this camera is simply feature packed.  Automatic scene selection?!  I was able move the camera and still take nice images; do you know what 26x zoom is capable of?  WOW!  And the full HD 1080p movie mode is a real bonus.  The high speed movie mode, up to 240fps is a nice novelty but limited in recording time making it just that, a novelty.In case you are wondering which memory card to order; Nikon recommends a Class 6 or better.I'm really looking forward to making the best of this camera beyond the simple point & shoot I'm use to.

I haven't had any error messages or problems with the zoom.  This camera had to pass the concert test.  I go to a lot of concerts and with my old Kodak 10X camera (Z612), I would take 60 picutres and would be lucky if I got 5 okay pictures and that was only after having to use photoshop to brighten the pictures.  The P100 totally passed the test!  I take the same amount of pictures and don't even have to use Photoshop to fix anything about most of the pictures.  I learned quickly that the best way to take photos at concerts is to use either subject tracking or a manual setting.  I don't even use a flash at a concert and still get great shots, even using the zoom.  With my old Kodak, the more zoom I used, the worse the picture and the darker it was.  I know that I have a lot to learn about the camera settings.I bought 2 generic batteries and a generic charger so that I don't have to charge the battery in the camera if I don't want to.  The charger I bought even has a usb port so I can charge my cell phone at the same time.  The battery life could be longer but that's probably b/c I review my pictures too much!As for the video, I haven't really had a chance to use it.  I tried using a Class 4 card and while it looked great on the camera, the speed wasn't fast enough when it was uploaded to the computer.  Therefore, on playback, while the sound quality was perfect, the video is choppy.  I need to get a Class 6 memory card and try that out.I love this camera and total recommend it.UPDATE ON THE VIDEO:  Still having trouble.  The video is of a clip from a concert - about 1 minute. It looks great on replay on the camera but then once transferred to the computer, the video picture is jerky and doesn't keep up w/ the music. The music is perfect sounding. First I used a 4GB SDHC memory card but it was a Class 4. So I bought an 8GB SDHC memory card which is a class 6. Both brands of cards are recommended in the back of the book. I figured my problem was that I had used a Class 4 when it said I needed a Class 6. But the Class 6 actually seemed to do a worse job than the class 4. Any idea what the heck I am doing wrong? I download pictures and video using the camera cord connected to the computer. The only thing I can think of is that I never downloaded the NIKON software to my computer b/c I currently use a different software for uploading. Could that be my problem? I wouldn't think that it would matter.

Great zoom range (26x) which goes well beyond the standard 3x you normally get.ConsZoom is a little touchy so you have to work at nudging it to not have it zoom really quick.

Also, if you use the EVF when zooming that will help stable the camera too.I always told myself that I would never take the leap to spend this much on a camera.

I've spent the last 2 or 3 months researching higher-end point-and-shoots, narrowing my choices down to the Canon sx30is, the Nikon s8100 (just because it was getting such rave reviews), and the Nikon P100.  I finally decided on the P100, despite reading some so-so reviews, including those whose cameras locked up on them.  I figured that wouldn't happen to me.I purchased the camera at Costco for an amazing deal (which also came w/a case and memory card -- great deal).  The next morning I opened it up, charged the battery 'til full, and tried it out.  I only played with it for about 5 minutes before it locked up on me.  It froze with the lens extended and wouldn't turn off or respond to any buttons, so I finally had to remove the battery.  It worked fine after that but I paid over $300 for this camera and I sure don't want one that's unreliable.  (I also noticed the zoom felt \"off\"... it was really sluggish zooming in and when zooming back out it was very fast.  I also noticed zoomed in shots with flash turned out gorgeous, but those w/o flash were blurry??)So now I'm torn.  I feel like this camera has an incredible amount of potential, but do I take the risk of purchasing another?  Or do I go to a different brand or model?

It is the first Nikon camera I have ever owned.  In the 5 months I have owned the P100, it has been in Nikon service for 2 OF THOSE MONTHS.  Each time Nikon had my camera for repairs, they replaced a whole list of parts and both times I received the camera back in far worse condition.  The more they work on it and replace parts the worse it gets.  And for some reason they keep sending it back to me with more and more problems and issues.  Unbelievable.  After spending another 2 hours on the phone with Nikon Tech Support, I was told the camera had to be sent back again.  So, for the THIRD TIME, I  sent the camera to them.  I was told they would let me know if they decide to replace it or try to fix it again.  Seriously.  My response to this statement was that if they COULD fix it then they WOULD have.  It wasn't fair to ask me to wait while they tried to fix it for the THIRD TIME.  They need to just replace it with a new camera.  In the meantime, I was asked to send a few of the pictures for Nikon to analyze.  The response I received from a Nikon supervisor said that the pictures I sent were bad because of the settings used and the composition.  For the glare problem, he instructed me NOT to face toward the sun when taking pictures.  He also suggested a setting to use for indoor low light conditions and asked me to try that and let him know how it works.  How insulting!  Wow.  Nikon is blaming me for all the picture and camera problems and not taking any responsibility for the fact that in the 8 weeks they have had my camera for repairs they were never able to fix it - and, in fact, made it worse and still sent it back to me like there was no problem.  And I can't very well try a different setting on a camera that I do not have - and this Nikon supervisor knew that the camera had been sent back.  When is Nikon going to take responsibility for their product and stand behind it?  They need to accept the fact that I just happened to get the one bad apple in the bunch.  I've already gone 8 weeks (and counting) without the use of my camera.  They've already had 2 chances to fix it and they haven't.  They need to replace it with a new camera before the last shred of respect - and confidence - I have for Nikon is gone.

I got pics of Orion's Nebula (the little purple star in Orion is actually a beautiful nebula and this camera picked it up beautifully).  The Seven Sisters (Pleiades / the Heart of Taurus) showed up like bright blue sapphires when I zoomed in really close.  It took me a minute to figure out how to make it auto-focus on such dim and distant objects, but it eventually worked and shocked me.  I can pick up Jupiter's Gallilean moons!The timer is essential and works perfectly with the 2s or 10s option.  Very handy and simple.  The lighting settings are also useful when taking shots of the moon when it is dimmer or brighter.The aperture mode makes for great still pictures up close and far away.

I use my DSLR much more now so I gave it to a friend because it was be neglected.  In some instances the image quality would be similar to a DSLR if you are not a pixel peeper.  The body was small, light, and easily fit into my small/medium sized hands.  Looks can be deceiving because this camera packed a large 26x zoom in the small body.  It is a great walk-around camera because of its versatility.  You can take up close up portraits up all the way up birds several hundred meters away.  Battery life would last a whole day but the only negative is that the battery was charged in the body.  The EVF was very nice to use especially if you take very long zoom shots which can help with stability.  One of the few gripes with this camera is that pictures can turn out soft, noise reduction can be very prominent, and some focus hunting at long range.  Overall one of best and funnest cameras I have ever owned.  I have churned out lots of great pictures and videos.  The autofocus is quick, image stabilization works well in long range shots, the camera has lots of features to try out, and the screen flips out.

The Sports Continuous setting was great for catching that amazing leap into the lake; my landscape pictures were wonderful; it took crisp, clear portraits.

This camera is a great compromise between a DSLR and a pocket camera, being smaller and lighter than the DSLR and having more versatility than the pocket cameras-- and has a look-through viewfinder in addition to the view screen, which is helpful in bright sunlight conditions.The main problem with this camera is that it is made of lightweight plastic and is not particularly durable.  I used to shoot with a manual film SLR camera which got banged around all the time and still worked and was relatively unaffected by moisture (e.g. rain.)

If you're like me and you're looking for a really good point and shoot that has great zoom capability, then you won't be dissapointed at all. I use this camera to take pictures of my kids and also for landscape pictures. It works great for both. Low light photos are the best I've seen in a point and shoot. Shutter response is terrific. I have pictures of my son in mid swing playing T ball that are professional looking. The panorama function works very well as long as there is enough distance between you and the subject, otherwise there is some curvature. The video quality is phenominal as well. The sound isn't the best, but it's passable. It does well enough that I decided against buying a camcorder, opting to just use the camera. I've had this camera for almost 2 years now, and i still love it. Buddy of mine recently purchased a high end canon point and shoot with 35X zoom and i believe 14mp. We took pictures side by side and this Nikon performed just as well and in some cases better than the canon. The only advantage the canon had was in zoom capacity. But the Nikon actually took better pictures at full zoom due to a better image stabilizer. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews, some of these people are expecting results like those from expensive DSLR's. You're not gonna get that from any point and shoot. But if you want a camera that performs extremely well for under $400, you will be very happy. Also, just a suggestion, but if you choose to purchase the p100 I would highly reccomend buying the external battery charger. You can pick one up with an extra battery for less than $20 if you shop it.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great travel camera", "Author": "Robert J.

I also own the Nikon Coolpix P100. We recently went on a three week cruise in Spain, North Africa, Canary Islands, Madiera, and Portugal. I took ONLY the P100 because it is so small, light and easy to manage. The range of photos I took went from inside caves, night scenes, blazing mid-day sun, cathedral interiors, out of bus windows, etc. The P100 does it all and the pictures are great. What a joy to operate as the camera shifts from automatic to completely manual depending on the demands of the scene. With the 26 to 1 zoom lens, you can photograph shots that others would miss. Long focal lengths dictate extra camera stability and the Nikon vibration reduction system pitches in to keep camera motion from spoiling your shots. I shot hand held pictures inside a cathedral at 1.3 seconds exposure. Not recommended, but there was no alternative and the P100 with some careful holding of the camera came through with good pictures. Nothing is perfect. The thing I missed was the ability to use a polarizing filter mounted on the camera. Sort of awkward to have to manage. I asked one pro how to manage, he said \"hold the camera steady with your left hand under the body of the camera, with the right hand press the shutter release while you hold the polarizing filter with the other hand .\" Er, ah, not so good. I would set the camera for a 10 second delay, press the shutter release and then hold the filter over the lens. Not too smooth, but it works. The tilt back also allows some photo angles that I would have missed otherwise. All in all, the P100 is a really great travel companion.

The ability to tilt the screen is invaluable, because the engines I photograph are about six feet in diameter and I have to get a top-down shot of the entire engine when I photograph them. The gantrys we have aren't all tall enough to see over them with, so I have to rely on the tilting screen.The ability of this camera to get closeup photos of small details is also invaluable, as part of my job entails catching the tiniest flaws in the inner workings of the engine, such as nicks on the compressor blades. A couple days ago I caught a nick in the blade that was no bigger than the thickness of my fingernail, and when I downloaded the pictures later I saw it on the screen, plain as day, with no adjustment or manipulation of the photo required.I really appreciate this camera, and would recommend it to anyone who needs a camera for detail work or photographing machinery.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Some nice features, but image quality is poor in several instances.", "Author": "JES \"gadget lover\"", "ReviewID": "R50JE0IV4BO5B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I use the camera for wildlife/scenic shots mostly, some indoor, but mostly outdoors.

The ONLY way to get an acceptable print is to Photoshop the tar out of the picture after it's taken.  Second, the build quality of this camera is very, very poor.  I understand it's considered a mega-zoom, but should the lens flop and wiggle around when it's zoomed out to any length?  Plus, after only 4 months of use the flash selection switch won't function making the possibility of a flash picture out of the question for me.Under no circumstances would I suggest this camera.

I considered competitive cameras from Panasonic, Fuji, and Cannon.  The P100 seemed to be the best compromise in performance for the price  When you consider all the factors, it matched or exceeded the others in performance with its mega zoom, HD video, EVF, and feature rich controls.  On paper there seemed to be no contest and with the price from Amazon the best available, I made this decision.  I had been using the Panasonic point and shoot with 10X zoom and had been very happy with it, but was looking for better performance and a longer zoom.  Here are some observations from someone that is not a professional and only takes pictures on a limited basis.PROS:  The zoom is fantastic since it will get out as far as anyone really needs for normal pictures.  It was pretty easy to use right out of the box and with the choice of using the display or the electronic viewfinder, selecting pictures & framing was great.  It seems to have a good combination of automatic point and shoot qualities with the ability to manually override any setting.  Downloading pictures was a snap using the included cable, but I found the class 6 card was not readable by my computer if I removed it and put it in the slot built into the computer.  I guess the technology was not there a few years ago when my computer was new.  I really like the Look and Feel of the camera and the ability to start HD video with only one button to push.  It allows you to take pictures, then video, then back to pictures without taking the camera down from your eye.  I saw a review that mentioned a negative because you had to use the camera to charge the battery, it's true, but for less than $20 you can get 2 extra batteries and a charger from Amazon, that works great.  Overall I'm very happy with the camera.CONS:  Picture quality so far is only good.  I was expecting great.  Maybe some of this is my fault since I haven't spent as much time learning all that it can do (not enough time).  Some pictures appear \"washed out\" and it seems to have trouble with lighting.  Again some of this may be my inexperience with the set up of the camera.  The zoom in low light conditions is impossible to use without blurring the picture.  If you plan on using the 26X zoom, plan on buying a tripod or what I did was purchase a monopod that works great.  Again it was available from Amazon for about $20, and even works as a walking stick.  Remember to turn off the \"anti-shake\" feature if you use the tripod.  The last negative is minor, but annoying.  I'm still trying to figure out how to find a simple way to determine how much battery power I have left, since it appears that you only get a \"warning\" when the battery is out of power.  If you only have one battery, you are now waiting hours for the battery to be charged.All in all I really like the camera and still feel it is the best available for the money.  I've not used the other cameras that I considered, but I'm still confident it was the right decision.Bill", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Seco", "ReviewID": "R1WQUM2NVLY1SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, easy to use, but you need to read first the manual to get excelent pictures.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Willie F.", "ReviewID": "R37D3FWHCM6MIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't get the benefit of a price deduction when the price dropped ten dollars before the camera shipped. so what do you want credit for?

As far as I know, no one else offers 1080p.  Linking the camera to a Hi-def television via HDMI cable is so convenient.  I haven't discovered a con yet unless it is the learning curve, especially if you are a beginner.  But even that is minimal - just do what you can do and learn the rest as you go.  The sensor and electronics are exceptional.  So far, can't say enough good things.  And the early delivery was the icing on the cake.

It was so disappointing, I'm not sure why Nikon made it. If I were Nikon, and this were the best I could make in the category, I'd stop production for that category altogether as it would be too damaging to my brand.The image quality was \"washed out.\" The vivid setting looked the same as the normal setting. It was so frustrating to watch the image look good, actually pretty good in the LCD view finder just before the camera took it, and then see the resulting image look washed out and lifeless. The video actually looked a bit more vibrant than stills.It had difficultly focusing at certain zoom settings. I would have to zoom out or in to get it to focus.The video, when played back on the computer, would stutter or show signs of pixelation for some clips. Other clips were fine.The smile detection mode worked very well. We had lots of fun playing \"Don't Smile!\" with it. Unfortunately, that wasn't why I bought it.The LCD articulates up and down, which is great for taking shots close to the ground.I bought this because the Canon we had died after prolonged periods of not using it (common issue with Canon shutters).

The unit had a dead pixel in the sensor which showed up as a blue spot on all the pictures I took.Buying a Nikon prosumer bridge camera my expectations were set very high based on the reviews I had read, however those expectations were not met even half way. To spend $400.00 for the top of the line point and shoot Nikon model and get middling results was to say the least disappointing part of the entire experience. Picture quality was half way decent, this based on my experience of using my prior 2 year old Kodak 8612 for comparison. I guess picture taking really has to do more with subject matter, composition, and experience than just having technology at your fingertips, this was so true when using the Nikon P100 and trying to take shots on the fly!The Nikon P100 is an unusually small and compact size camera  for the features it boasts. The swivel LCD screen is a nice gimmick, but falls short of any usefulness because it swivels only partially up or down, unlike the full swiveling screens in the Canon SX..IS models, which allows you to compose self portraits. There is no option to use a secondary flash on this unit or any option to use any kind of filters, which defeats the purpose of having manual control over-rides. The 26x zoom is a nice touch, but better have very steady hands to use it otherwise you need to control your voyeuristic tendencies. The 1080p video recording option is also overkill as it fills up the memory card really fast and before you realize it you have run out of memory to take more pictures or you end up deleting the video you just took to take some more pictures, neither which is a great option when on a vacation you are trying to digitize every moment for posterity.Till now I had never been a big fan of high end expensive point and shoot cameras, and my experience with the Nikon P100 has reinforced my belief that if you are going to use a point and shoot there is no need to splurge and waste your money on something like it. If your are really serious about bringing the creativity out in yourself then bite the bullet and go for a mid-price DSLR which will give you the most options as and when you progress in your abilities.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera freezes", "Author": "Auramagna", "ReviewID": "R23Q5WENP52SGS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I read reviews that stated it froze at times.

I used the camera for a weekend at a soccer tournament, outdoor evening party, and a birthday party indoors.1) the view finder is worthless; it is like looking through a 1950's TV. It cannot be used to track a running child on a soccer field. The quality of the image you see when looking through the viewfinder is also very, very poor.2) the sport mode captures great sequences, BUT you have to wait 15-20 seconds (or longer) for the sequence to record BEFORE you can focus and shoot your next photo. For me, it was a huge deal breaker.3) the flash is powerful, BUT it distorts colors. I found this to be true when shooting outside and indoors.4) the image sensor cannot operate in sun/shade conditions. I was shooting a soccer game in the shade, but the field was in full sun. The only way I could get the sensor to adapt to the full sun was to point the lens towards the sky and then back down to the players on the field.

I have taken a hand held shot of the moon and gotten stunning results. The lens, even at it's longest zoom produces very nice images. The HD movies must seen to be believed. Use the HDMI output to show your movies on an HDTV and you will think you are watching a DVD. Where the P100 really shines is in Macro mode. The Macro mode is made even more user friendly by the flip up and flip down LCD screen. This is the first one I have used and I will never be without this feature again.There are so many different modes and options I still haven't explored them all. My favorite option is BSS mode. That stands for Best Shot Selector. In this mode you can shoot a stationary subject (doesn't work on moving subjects) and hold down the shutter button as it takes up to ten shots at about 2 frames per second. Then when you are done shooting it will choose the sharpest shot of the group and save it and delete the rest. True magic.The menu systems are clear and easy to find things with. One of the things that really impress me over other \"bridge\" cameras I have owned is the ability to remember your settings when you turn the camera off. Every other camera I have had reverts to the default setting when you turn the camera back on, which can be a real pain.The only real negative I can come up with for this camera is I have not been too successful at birds in flight.

My only complaint so far is the rather stupid battery level indicator: when it comes on you're almost out of battery! No early warning, no way of checking your actual battery level at any time. My older camera included a battery meter icon that was divided in several bars, so you could actually estimate pretty well the remaining battery charge at any time by just counting the number of bars shown on the battery icon. Not so with the P100: as per page 26 of the manual if the battery icon is OFF your battery is still OK (it actually states \"Battery Fully Charged\"). Once the icon appears it means \"Battery level LOW, prepare to charge or replace the battery\". So this basically allows a situation in which the battery level might be slightly above the warning threshold, so you might actually think you are still good to go, when in reality you're almost out of battery. I presume the Lithium battery used in this camera is of the \"intelligent\" kind, so implementing a better battery charge meter should have been very easy in terms of the ability to accurately read the battery status. My 8+ year old Sony camera does that.This is my first Nikon camera, so unless this type indicator style has been the norm, frankly I can't understand why Nikon would implement such a useless battery level indicator. Granted I would never leave without a spare battery, and from experience with my earlier camera, your battery charge will invariably always be exhausted when it is needed the most, so I always had a second battery on hand. But this is beyond the point of this discussion.My opinion of the very least battery charge meter resolution I could live with in this camera:No battery icon shown: Battery between 100-50% charged.Battery icon shown steady: Battery charge between 50-10%.Battery icon flashing: less then 10% charge remaining.So Nikon, the Coolpix P100 is undoubtedly a great camera, but perhaps you could fix the flimsy battery level indicator with a Firmware download/upgrade and that can be performed from the end user side. Mine has v1.0 so I hope something will be done to correct this mistake. This model being brand new, hopefully as more people buy it and also realize this small but significant shortcoming, more complaints will be heard and hopefully something will be done about it.

I do not think that the fact that I don't have one should really affect the validity of the following review.First off, its NEW, and that alone means that its better than last year's camera, so its got to be worth owning on that score alone.Second, based on the reviews, people seem to like it... A LOT, so once again, that is a very good indicator that its worth every penny.Now, for more personal observations: It is smaller than most SLR's built up to this point... I like that... (If there has always been a drawback to getting professional quality photos, it has been the size and weight of the cameras). This is smaller and lighter. I like it. I just know I do. Second, but no less personal: It's a Nikon. And look at how affordable it is! I have seen Nikons for thousands of dollars this is a fraction of the price! I'm sure the people at Nikon wouldn't sell something inferior even if it is affordable. Besides it isn't Thaaat affordable. I mean compared to a Fuji or something like that.So in summe, it's a great camera, I don't own one, but just the knowledge that I could is a plus! And a lot of people on this site, with a lot more experience using it than myself say it is... so I am sure it is! And if you are on the fence about this I hope this review helped you decide which way to go.
