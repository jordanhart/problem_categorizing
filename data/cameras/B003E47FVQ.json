But you would be much better off to spend an extra $30 and buy a \"real\" digital camera with optical zoom, decent optics, a clear view screen, and full features.  This camera has none of these things.  Cheap, flimsy plastic construction, a fixed 8.5 mm lens, a tiny, blurry view screen, poor autofocus, and only the most basic of features.  It doesn't even have a time/date stamp capability.  It does not come with any memory, so you are already out another $8 - $10 to buy a 2Gb memory card for the camera.  And when you use the flash, the camera eats batteries like crazy.  I purchased this unit because I take a lot of pictures for my work.  I was looking for a lightweight digital camera inexpensive enough to be \"disposable\" after being subjected to extended wear and tear.  The Polariod a500 was a total failure so I ended up buying another camera -- a Kodak EasyShare C180, and I have been very pleased with it.  I gave the Polaroid a500 to my kids.  They think it's great.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "I'd sooner buy a throw-away camera!", "Author": "hacker", "ReviewID": "R1WPBXVDJF6CKH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After receiving this camera I realize that usually 'you get what you pay for'. This is the flimsiest camera I have ever held. Aside from that, I took several photos and not ONE came out clearly. I couldn't possibly have returned this piece of junk any faster.

The price was almost the same as most of the toys I looked at, which by the way were mostly 1.3 MP cameras. Big difference. So I ordered this and I'm happy that I did.
