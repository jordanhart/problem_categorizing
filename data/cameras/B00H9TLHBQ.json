Read other Mobius reviews for general info but specifically for this one after one month of ownership:* Wide-angle lens is a good choice here. I haven't tried the standard lens but have several action cams where I usually don't run wide-angle. I think it make sense for a dash cam; can see a bit more.* Kit is very convenient. Needed the mount/holder, long cable, cig adapter and ~4 mount clips (and a micro SD card). Other stuff is optional.* The long powered USB cord just barely fit for my compact SUV. I think I'd go with a foot longer in a bigger car. BTW, search youtube for 'mount dashcam hide wires' to see really slick ways to hide the cabling. I was worried people would see this as too obvious (and maybe break-in) but it almost looks stock or perhaps maybe like a low-end radar detector. Anyway - not worried any more.Only other general things:* Replaying footage is a bit of a pain. I've only done it a couple of times but I've ejected the card rather than remove the camera but it's tight to get in there.* It will help you a bit if you are: slight techy (for cam config/software install), a little mechanical (for the install/wiring), and not new to cams (I don't know if I'd suggest this as a first cam for someone that doesn't work with videos/HD/etc.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "One Kick-a$$ camera!!!", "Author": "Luis Canela", "ReviewID": "RIONQBZGG0Z3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is on par with the more expensive ones, imagewise it rivals the popular action cams. It weighs way less, it is smaller, and best of all, it is 1/4 the price. I particularly like the no frills, turn it on and it goes setup. Also, there are some adapters that go from the GOPRO mount type to the 1/4\" 20 camera mount.This means that you can use readily available mounts, and attach this beauty to those mounts. I have also set this camera up on my V912 Heli, even crashed the heli, with no damage to the camera. This camera does everything I need and nothing I don't. I have several buddies eyeing this camera because of the quality of videos that I have taken.

The camera is real small, fits in the palm of your hand. It has a professional look and feel to it. The accessories (dashcam kit) are great. As long as your car isnt cold, the suction cup holds good. The camera's resolution is high definition and looks amazing in my 47 inch tv. There are A LOT of different options. You can even download an app and change the settings directly from your smart phone with the proper usb cable (sold separately) Its nearest competitor is the Gopro cam. Which cost over 300$ plus tax. This camera is great for under 100$. Its not water proof and probably not shock proof as the gopro, but one can easily make your own custom cases if you want. At night it looks just as good, like you're there. I took a short video and you can see for yourself [...] its not a great view, but the purpose of the video was to show my girl the recording, NOT as a review for the camera, but you can see it and hear the sound too. Anyways, I recommend this 100%", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Yes, The Mobius Is As Good As You May Have Heard It Is", "Author": "David Martin", "ReviewID": "R2EMQCZSEU7ZL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have seen the reviews on YouTube, DashCamTalk & RCgroups and are wondering if this little camera is everything it is cracked up to be, I'll add another thumbs up! The online, downloadable Users Guide is far superior to what you are likely to find in other Chinese-made cameras, even though the other cameras may be just fine. The PC-based interface that is available to change the camera settings works good too. The designer obviously spent a great deal of time and effort working with users of their previous designs to develop a product that has a number of useful features. If you plan to use it as a Dash-Cam, I'd recommend getting the Dash Cam Kit if you want a simple plug and play unit. It does much more but unless you are moderately technically adept, you may become frustrated trying to understand the variety of settings options and how to handle everything.Pros:Small size makes it very discreet, very good day and night video quality, wide range of settings options, good range of optional mounting accessories, appears quite reliable, many of these cameras are used on radio-controlled aircraft which can be extremely-rough service. This unit is easily modified with optional lenses, external battery packs or capacitors, etc., if you are so inclined.Cons:It doesn't offer a GPS interface, Waterproof housings are not yet widely available, No optional polarized lense cap which might help to reduce windshield reflection and sun flare is available.Gosh, now it sounds like I am complaining but really, this tiny camera already does so much, so incredibly well that it is pretty hard to fault it simply because it isn't the only camera anyone would ever want for any purpose. I'd rate it six stars if I could!Now I just wish I could find a video editing program that didn't require so much time to edit my clips for YouTube!", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome action cam for low $100s!", "Author": "Robert C.", "ReviewID": "R2NQ6ZLR1T36LS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great action camera for the price!

But after watching You Tube reviews on how to set it up and first testing it as a webcam before placing it in my car I learned it is a very good camera. Two things you need to know; if you want to use this camera as a webcam and placed away from the pc you need to purchase a 16 foot usb cable that has a signal booster built in not provided with your camera. And I wish the cable for use in the vehicle was one foot longer to properly hide it along the window and door pillar. The video and audio are very good.

I had put buying both off when I heard of the WiFi troubles associated with that brand of camera until I heard of the simple solution: Try the Mobius ActionCam which does not rely on WiFi transmission and is 1/3 to 1/4 the cost and nearly half the weight. The camera came with a Dash mounting kit that was easily adapted to the stock camera mount that came with the Quadcopter. No instructions were included with the camera but a quick Google search of \"Mobius Camera Instructions\" came up with at least 2 dozen hits. All were very informative and written in English as a 1st language. I chose one that went right to operation and setup modes and I did take the short cut to the charging section and while the unit was charging I did the reading of the manual. After spending 15-20 minutes reading and getting familiar with the instructions, I was recording and reviewing videos on the computer. Since this was done at night I had to wait until the next day to try it out while flying and the results were nothing less than spectacular. Very crisp and clear video and the sound quality is great. Play back was easy to do and is a plug and play design. The overall video was shaky due to the nature of what I was doing but that  was me not the camera. In short, I would recommend this camera to any one that wants to save money and spend it elsewhere like extra batteries for the Quad, a waterproof box for the camera and maybe a gimble system to stabilize the jitters of flying on a Quad. I have been flying R/C for 35 years and I am anxious to see how this will operate in a Turbine powered Jet, so I am off to shopping for another camera.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera, do not hesitate!", "Author": "Flytrap \"John - Systems Support Analyst\"", "ReviewID": "R3AZQOGAJ84QET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little camera.
