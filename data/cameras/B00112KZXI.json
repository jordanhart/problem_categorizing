It took 120 film, and had no controls other than the shutter release.  In high school, I upgraded to a 110 Minolta camera that didn't take appreciably better pictures, but was more portable.  In college I decided that I needed a real camera.  Minolta made a 110 SLR at the time, which I briefly considered, but fortunately passed on in favor of the ME Super.  This opened up the whole world of different ISO film, called \"ASA\" at that time.  I experimented with super-fast and grainy Fuji 1600 film and incredibly sharp Kodachrome 25 slide film.  You'd probably have to spend upwards of $20,000 today to get a digital camera capable of that level of detail.This is the camera that taught me how to take pictures.  I learned the relationship between f-stop and shutter speed, depth of field, and composition.  Shutter speed was visible inside the viewfinder; my only beef with the camera was having to look away and check the lens barrel for the aperture, an annoyance since I adjusted the aperture far more than shutter speed.  I took it everywhere with me, either in a backpack or a bicycle handlebar bag that I bought just for the camera.  I had it with me when I was living in Africa for several years - the battery ran out and could not be replaced, so I had to set it at the default 1/125 shutter speed.  Unfortunately, I didn't have an exposure table, so I had to guess at the f-stop; most of my photos from that period are seriously overexposed.One reason I wanted an SLR was to be able to compose the pictures in the viewfinder without having to compensate for parallax.  I also wanted the option of changing lenses, although as it turned out, the only lens I ever used with it was the 50 mm 2.0 it came with.  Zoom lenses at the time were disdained as too large and bulky, with lower image quality and slower speeds compared to a fixed-focus lens at any comparable focal length.  \"Zoom\" was accomplished by moving closer to or farther away from the subject.  This is how I learned composition.About 10 years ago, I tentatively decided to upgrade to medium format.  A real MF like Hasselblad or Mamiya was out of reach, so I started with an Argoflex twin-lens reflex that took 620 film.  This is the same size as 120; the only difference is that 120 uses thick plastic spools, while 620 uses comparatively thinner metal ones.  If you try to run 120 film through a 620 camera, it will jam about halfway through the roll.  The way around this is to unwind the 120 roll and transfer it to 620 spools.  After this grew tiresome, I picked up an old Moskva 5, the top of the line for that marque, that was based on Zeiss Ikonta specifications that the Germans had provided to the Soviets as war reparations.  It was a beautiful camera, plagued with light leaks and a rangefinder that only approximated the correct focus.After that, I finally sprung for my first digital, a Fuji 2650 that I still have, and use for photographing eBay listings, since it doesn't require any thought or adjustment at all.  Since then, I've gone through several \"bridge\" and \"superzoom\" cameras, frustrating for their lack of control over the shot.  It's as if everything I painstakingly learned with the ME Super was now being handled badly by the on-board electronics.  Since I didn't understand how to work within digital's narrower exposure limits, I had plenty of blown pixels that no amount of post-processing could restore.I finally discovered the Canon s90, which combines the size of a point-and-shoot with the controls of a SLR.  I also learned how to use a histogram, and figured out that while a blown-out, white pixel contains no information, an apparently black pixel can nearly always be adjusted later to reveal hidden detail.  What's interesting is how my attitude toward portability has changed.  The s90 is about the size of the proverbial pack of cigarettes, and can go anywhere.  I don't know how I put up with the comparatively bulky ME Super, but it wasn't a problem at the time.  Neither was the annoyance of film, that had to be developed before you could see the results, and couldn't be manipulated later without a darkroom and a lot of expensive equipment.  There was that suspense of not knowing if you had the shot, and not being able to go back later to try again.  No one who grows up with digital is going to understand that.I've since considered moving up to a DLSR, but the tradeoff is a much larger, more complex, and less spontaneous system for marginally better quality photos.  One thing I've never been able to figure out is why most DLSRs seem to be laid out like film cameras, with the mirror and optical viewfinder, neither of which is necessary anymore, except for sports photography or other applications with fast-moving subjects, where other cameras simply won't be able to focus fast enough to get the shot.I work in an area where I see many tourists, most of whom are lugging around gigantic DSLRs with zoom lenses like howitzers.  There's really no need for this.  A DSLR is not simply a digital version of a film SLR.  The big advantage of a SLR was the ability to control aperture and shutter speed.  White balance could be modified with filters, and ISO by using film of different speeds.  And of course, the big thing was changing focal length by switching lenses.  Today, even a low-end digital point-and-shoot is going to have the ability to control all of these functions to some degree - a big improvement over the point-and-shoot cameras of the film era, which weren't good for anything other than snapshots.  The main advantage of a DSLR is the ability to make these changes quickly, by turning a knob instead of having to root through a menu, although many of the low-end DSLRs don't even have the same manual controls of my s90.  A DSLR will (or should) also have better low-light performance.  The majority of people who invest in a DSLR don't need any of this, as they are usually just taking photos that would come out just as good with a cell phone camera.The ME Super represents an era when technology was striving for the highest fidelity possible.  The stereo systems of the time had the same impetus - size was no object; an \"audiophile\" system that could take up an entire wall had a direct-drive turntable, and other \"components\" such as a separate radio tuner, amplifier, graphic equalizer, and speakers whose quality (and cost) was directly proportional to their size and the presence of separate \"woofers\" and \"tweeters.\"  Now in both sound and vision, the trend is toward miniaturization - 30 years ago, who would have thought that people would be using cell phones smaller than a graham cracker, with built-in cameras and sound systems; that extreme portability would trump quality?  A modern state-of-the-art sound system is an iPod with earbuds.  The cameras built into cell phones are good enough for what most people use them for.Photography has always been a high-tech art form, even when Nicephore Niepce was taking the first grainy exposures of the rooftops outside his window.  I remember many years ago a professional photographer telling me that cameras haven't gotten better, they've just gotten smarter.  For me, the ME Super is the point when my own journey first intersected with the relentless march of technology.  For a moment, I had one of the best cameras in the world, where I was limited only by my own creativity, and not by the machinery.  I wish everyone could experience that.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "The Pentax ME was an aperture priority automatic camera, with an electronic focal plane shutter from 8 s to 1/1000 s, synchronized at 1/100s\nThe Pentax ME had a 0.97\u00d7 viewfinder, covering 92% of the field.\nThere was a hot shoe on the top of the prism and a self-timer.
