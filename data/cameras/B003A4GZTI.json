The lag on this thing is ridiculous....my phone has a small lag but shoots faster than this....and even when you press the picture button all the way it doesnt take a picture so you have to try to take your pictures again.....and sometimes the 1st time would have been the perfect shot.....or you miss a shot....the charging was funny because sometimes it would charge right up and others it would seem to take forever....You get what you pay for so buyers beware......it finally broke on me and I just didnt feel like going through the trouble of camera shopping so i've been using my phone.....now with my birthday coming up I will need a camera for this week of fun out of town.....I have a Panasonic now......I'll keep you posted.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "LCD screen is defective", "Author": "fred", "ReviewID": "R3QDQAQSI0ZR08", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera in September, five months later the screen developed swirly lines and blurry images. Olympus refused to owner the warranty and stated that was due to possibly a drop or mishandling yet the camera didn't have a scratch on it.

The flash when i needed it, and the great zoom pictures taken. When I didnt shoot, it would fit nicely in my pocket. add a 8mb card and theres over 600 pictures to take. The price was good but now others on the market are comparable in price. I don't regret buying because i didn't have to shop for it.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera blues", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "R1UKMOW8AXQ6G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Instruction sheet is too general and does not cover several features or uses.
