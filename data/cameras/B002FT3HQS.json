The learning curve is huge, do to the lack of detailed instruction. I also purchased a 3 ft extension which fits in the lid of the case perfectly.

Completely dead, and would not take a charge.  I checked and the power cord was supplying power.  I liked the unit well enough that I would have swapped out the nonworking monitor for another one, but that's not how the system worked and I had to return the entire unit for the seller to check it out.  No problem dealing with the seller though I was told I only had a couple of weeks to return the unit for a refund.  I purchased my unit shortly before Christmas and the deadline may have been for Christmas gift returns regardless of any problem.  It may be that with the dead monitor the seller would have taken the unit back after the deadline.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome device", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R2YOTLKJLATB5D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is great for Kenwall Waterly searching great for drains great for toilet holes all and all a very great product", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice product", "Author": "Gerald L Spears", "ReviewID": "RPOE45CJITNLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this inspection camera, I am a Cat5 cable installer, and this thing has more than paid for itself.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "cool!", "Author": "paul", "ReviewID": "R3VB8GDPJQ5XCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "was uncertain if it fit the snake extension I ordered, since they shipped from 2 sources, but amazon was right, they work just fine together. I use it for electric work. I stuff a weighted string in the wall hole for the switch/receptacle I cut in, then go in the basement and use the monitor & camera hook to grab my weighted string through a 3/4\" hole. The removable monitor works fine through floors, just as long as you are within 30' of the transmitting camera.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Waterproof snake", "Author": "Timothy J.
