I own three of these (HS20, HS25, and the HS50) each one better than the previous version.  This is an awesome camera, not quite DSLR quality but pretty close especially considering how much more I'd have to pay in lenses and extra accessories to get even close to the amazing versatility I get with this camera without ever having to change the lens or add a single accessory.  But if I want to I can add accessories and do so easily with no need for special adaptors I just screw filters, conversion lenses, etc on to the front of my manual zoom lens.  And because it is manual zoom with no extra wear and tear on the motor of a motorized zoom lens.  I call mine a poor man's DSLR :) But all kidding aside this entire HS series are great cameras and the HS50 is by far the best of the bunch and there is literally no situation from extreme macro to landscape it can't handle and give very good quality pictures.Its features are easy to access without your having to go into the entire menu system to access them.  The manual zoom is so much faster and more accurate than the motorized zooms that once you get used it you will never want to go back to the motorized zoom for still pictures.  Using the manual focus feature is so much easier with peek focus and with a real focus ring that you turn instead of pressing buttons its faster and more accurate. The burst rate on this is amazing 11fsp at full 16mp and 16fsp at 8mp and burst is not it own setting it can be used with the regular modes of the camera.  You can adjust the color settings beyond the normal WB with the color shift setting.  Just can't say enough about how good these cameras are and the built quality on all of them is excellent.So if you are looking for a very fast, well built camera that has ton's for features and takes very good pictures the HS50 is definitely that camera best one I've owned so far", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Service excellent but package needs to be tweeked.", "Author": "Toni Shores", "ReviewID": "R2YVFJHTJZXGEH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is proving to be exciting to learn and offers excellent opportunities in photography adventures.  The only item that needs to be changed in the entire package is the camera case. The camera case is an excellent case and is good for carrying the camera but not much else.  You don't buy this many lenses, battery charger, etc., and then leave them behind.  I would recommend including a case big enough to package the camera and all the lenses and accessories.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "David B.", "ReviewID": "R3ISCTBLXCBI74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have really enjoyed this camera so far.

Not going to go in depth because many reviews are already their in detail. It all arrived and packed up fine in the box and I received it when they said I was going to. The thing I will say is that the box it came in smelled like oil and When I opened it up the camera bag smelled like oil. I have had it a month now and the smell is right there. Neither my cats or me with my asthma can go near it so I will have to buy a new one. But that is the only con that I will say about this company and Camera. Buy it if your thinking about it you can't go wrong.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buy it now, great camera", "Author": "Kelvin Trefz", "ReviewID": "R3CP4RL1DSXN83", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very thing worked as expected.

Colbert \"dcolb121\"", "ReviewID": "R342514VYBO2OQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This would be a better deal if you get rid of most of the extra lenses and offer a wireless remote and/or flash instead.  Macro and tele add on lenses aren't much use when the camera by itself will pretty much do what those lenses are meant to provide.Fairly happy with the camera itself, other than a rather soft look to the pics when zoomed in.  Very fast start-up and practically no shutter lag.  Wonderful features (tracking focus, eye sensor, manual lens, etc).  I didn't realize how slow my Nikon 500 was on startup until I got this one.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good bridge camera with lots of good features.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2F5C4CYVKF9WV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera based upon a close friend having.  We are both serious photographers who normally utilize a Nikon DSLR.  In talking with him and seeing the quality and features of thi s camera I knew I had to get one.  I have really liked the slow motion video feature on this camera.  I am also very impressed with the 16 fps and how well it works.  There have been several times that I wasn't impressed with the auto focus but overall it's a very good camera.  Still learning the different modes but what I have used so far I like.  As a bridge camera I would definitely and highly recommend this camera.  It was well worth the money and a good investment!", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Am very pleased.", "Author": "Guy R.

The camera takes great pictures! Love FujiFilm. I have taken some photos with the camera and used some of the accessories, and see so much clarity and will enjoy using this camera more and more.  As time goes on, I will do a better review of the camera and accessories.My issue is the company that I ordered from.  They need to say that it will take 2 processing days, I ordered on a Saturday, knowing that it wouldn't be looked at until the following Monday, and then it would be shipped out on Monday afternoon.  I paid for 2 day shipping, which was pricey, but I was thinking it would be here before I left for vacation.  They did not ship it until Tuesday in the afternoon for the accessories, and early evening for the actual camera.  On the day that I was supposed to leave, the accessories were delivered, and when I called to inquire about the camera (that was NOT in the box) I was told that it was coming in a different shipment.  I was annoyed because I was not informed that this would be happening, nowhere on the site (Amazon) does it say that this will come in 2 shipments. Nor does it say 'Please allow 24-48 hrs processing time'.  I find it hard to believe that they have so many orders to go through that they don't tend to the expedite shipments right away on Monday when the office opened.I was told to call when I received the camera and they'd rectify the situation, and he gave me (at this time, it is not in my possession it will be here 7-10 business days) a 32g memory card.  This does nothing for me as I paid for 2 day shipping, on top of the price for the kit.I have the camera and kit in my possession, but feel that the customer service could have been better. I found it rude to be interrupted whenever I tried to speak, and being told things that were not known before ordering, which would have prevented me from ordering in the beginning.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "great pictures", "Author": "kmp", "ReviewID": "R22KURF8O9WJB7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the quality of pictures.
