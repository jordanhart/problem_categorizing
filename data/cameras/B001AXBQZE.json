The quality of the image that it produces is not great.  I guess that you get what you pay for.  Color is \"off\" and I get color \"blooms\" at the edges of objects.  Marginally acceptable for what I needed so I did not return it.  If I needed two, I would not buy another one of these.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price.", "Author": "Bystander", "ReviewID": "RRCIALX7VUAQQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for the money. It has a good picture and I was astonished at it's low light capability. The only complaint I have after about 1 month's use is that the information and directions included with the camera are VERY lacking. The only thing included tells how to adjust the varifocal lense and even then it is a poor desription and apparently poorly translated from another language (grammar). Even though there are 6 switches & 1 rotating level adjustment on the back of the camera there are no directions for any of that whatsoever. Perhaps they think a pro installer don't need them but for a camera of this price there would probably be many amateur installers buying them. There is also a tiny allen wrench included with the camera and I found \"a place\" on the camera to use it but I have no idea what it does! Lack of information is why I only gave this camera 4 stars instead of 5 but otherwise I highly recommend.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very sharp image.", "Author": "Henry", "ReviewID": "RZYUN2P17V6DX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a very good deal for the price. Before you can use it, you have to focus the lens. The picture image is as good as you focus it. The night vision capacity of this camera is good, you can see clearly with street lights present. The mounts are very stable and strong being made out of steel. I can't really find anything bad about this product.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "very good product", "Author": "J. L.
