It is a clean looking wifi camera.  The lights on the front (power and wifi connection) can be turned off, so they are not too distracting. I have this set up in the corner of a playroom in our basement so I can keep an eye on my daughter.I had a terrible time trying to get this set up on my network.  Part of the problem is that I am not an IT engineer.  The other part of the problem is that the software interface is NOT user-friendly.  You have to know a LOT of networking jargon to get this to work correctly.  Also, the picture quality is only average on this.  I am not getting a very good HD picture.  It serves its purpose, but I would suggest looking at the Foscam FI8918W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67\u00b0 Viewing Angle) - Black NEWEST MODEL (replaces the FI8908W) too.  I have one of those and, at less than 1/3 of the price, it has a better picture, is easier to network and has a motorized base.The mount also has a lot of interference with the antenna.  There are several position I wanted to use that were impossible because of interference between the tightening nut on the base and the antenna.  I eventually got it to work, but this was a less than ideal design.The \"night vision\" is pretty useless.  The instructions say it will work for about 15 feet, but my experience is that it is only useful for about 5-8 feet.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Requires networking expertise to install", "Author": "Erika Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R1YIKV3VPP0WVO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a wireless video surveillance camera for networking experts or computer hackers. The box includes a video camera, a charger for the camera, a screw-on WiFi antenna, a heavy duty metal camera mount with thumbscrew 360 degree adjustibility, an ethernet cable for wired installations, a CD-ROM with software and user guides, and a paper quick-start brochure. The camera can supposedly produce high definition video at 720p and has IR night vision as well. There is a mini-socket on the camera so that you can plug in an external speaker. The camera also has a USB socket so that you could plug it into USB storage. Apparently, the software is intended to allow you to monitor the camera using live view, take photos at scheduled intervals, or take photos using a motion detect trigger.The steel mounting bracket is the best thing about this camera--at least they didn't skimp for mounting. However, the mounting and adjustment screws aren't spaced properly where the mount connects to the camera, and there's not enough clearance to use them with the antenna attached to the camera. The camera is a nice white color and feels hefty. The flashing LEDs on the camera can be turned off via the software if you can get the software working.As for installation and use--it's absolutely impossible without considerable networking expertise. The software included on the CD is not functional and looks like a pre-alpha test version. (For instance, it opens up to fullscreen mode and you really have to hunt to find anything like a minimize button.) Interestingly, despite being primitive and nonfunctional, the software on the manufacturer's website has never been updated. The directions in the quickstart guide for connecting the camera don't work, and neither do the directions in the full manual found on the CD-ROM. For example, in the full manual, they say if you're having trouble connecting the camera, \"connect camera directly to computer to proceed.\" Hunh? How? Via USB? Via the Ethernet cable? Then, assuming you figure out what they meant, they provide instructions for picking through advanced TCP/IP settings in WinXP--if you have a different operating system, you'll have to figure out how to access and set those advanced settings yourself.Fortunately, a previous reviewer provided a hint about how to actually set the camera up. He said you \"simply\" have to log in to your router and use the WPS. I searched on the net, found instructions about how to log into my router, and then picked through my router software settings to find some mention about WPS and a button to enable it on the router. Then I found the tiny WPS button in the back center of the camera (not documented by the manufacturer) and pressed it. Nothing happened. I unplugged the camera for a while, then plugged in it again, and magically, it now appeared on the list of devices found by my router. Once the router found the camera, the link from the manufacturer's IP Finder software finally worked. That opened up an Internet Explorer window (UGH!), which downloaded an ActiveX control, and an image from the camera appeared in the IE window. I played around with the image for a few minutes and noted how there seems to be a 3 second delay in \"live view\". I pressed the MPEG tab in the browser to see if that would make a difference in the delay, and the image disappeared. I haven't been able to get it back again, not even by restarting both my computer and the camera.Apparently, there is some freeware software called iSpy that allows you to use and control just about any camera, which might make this camera useable since the manufacturer's software is dead in the water. This isn't a model that is preset in iSpy, however. To install the camera manually on iSpy, you need to know the IP address of the camera, which you can get from your router once you get the camera connected using the procedure described above. You also need to know the name of the ActiveX control; by picking through the source code of the browser page, I found \"UltraHVCam.cab\". And you have to know enough about IP cameras, ActiveX controls and iSpy to put that information to use. If you can figure all that out, please write up some step-by-step instructions and post them as a review--there's no other info out there that I can find to make use of this camera. In the meantime, I'll set this camera on a shelf to use as a decoy and return to using my old camera, which though limited in function, was at least possible to get working.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wanted To Like It, But Falls Short", "Author": "C. Hill \"CFH\"", "ReviewID": "RR5VKSWN9UCEW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Mace Security Easy Watch Surveillance Camera has a lot of good features, but sadly it just isn't quite consumer friendly enough for casual users. I have tried several different brands of network security cameras (including the excellent Logitech Alert system) so have a good idea of how these systems should work and this one falls short. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Wireless Setup; One-touch WPS worked well, just log into your router and tell it to expect the WPS connection, press the button on the camera, acknowledge the request and the camera is on the network+ Quality; the hardware is well made and is very sturdy+ Wireless Networking; the camera has a very good 802.11n Wi-Fi range+ Two-Way Audio; allows both monitoring and talking through the camera when speakers are connected (not included), making this usable as a door camera+ Event Notification; easy to setup eMail alerts and works well, including sending a photo from the cameraCons -- Rough Software; the Easy Watch PC viewing software is not very user friendly- Remote Monitoring; this works well when connecting from your home network, but it is difficult to setup for monitoring from the Internet and requires you to have a DDNS account (several services supported but most are subscription)- Night Vision; it works, but is very limited in range and clarity- Image Quality; supports three image quality settings (H.264, MPEG4, and MJPEG), none of which are outstandingMisc -* The indicator lights for power and Wi-Fi can be turned off via the software* Power cord is 5' long, which needs to be taken into consideration for camera locationI hope that Mace releases an update for their software and provides an integrated remote monitoring service (like most of the competitors do), but for now the cumbersome remote access and lack of user friendly software makes this too hard to use for me to recommend this camera at this time.CFH", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quick surveillance +  less than ok set up  = not Mac friendly", "Author": "Scott Anderson \"Sharpsburg\"", "ReviewID": "R1ERCOY9TWRDNA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After I spent a while searching the internet for software that was Mac compatible I gave up and switched to the PC setup and finished installing the camera.The camera has a really nice look to it, with clean lines and quick setup right out of the box. I like that you can turn off the flashing lights in the front of the camera and you can wall mount it or set it on the included pedestal and have it ready to go. The main concern you will find is trying to find the right angle to setup when you add the wireless antenna.  The antenna takes away from the limitless set up that is possible when you use it as a wired camera.  Mace should have reworked the support before shipping, it sorts of looks like an after thought when they developed the antenna.The frustration begins because the software and installation setup lends itself to a more techy sort of install.  I'm familiar with such installations but for for the average homeowner it will be taxing for someone without the network background or time to fiddle with the quirky software.  The software leaves something to be desired in the setup.  I've demoed the Logitech surveillance system and it was easy and the system had some really nice user friendly software.As for picture quality, it's a bit grainy and needs to be tweaked at the factory for an upgrade.  If what I am seeing is truly HD then there is something wrong with the HD, however it is an OK picture if you are not looking for exacting detail.  Lastly the night vision, or should I say night feet vision is very limited.  About 10 feet is what you may get in a good situation, certainly not something worth promoting in the sales of this item.  If you get more than 10 feet you must have a special system but then again for an interior camera, night vision of 5-10 feet may be all that is needed.I give it 3 stars for the initial look, feel and design.  However it really falls short in not having Mac compatibility, antenna issues with the installation, quirky software that gets frustrating at times, and a less than HD quality image when it's all said and done.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "not mac-friendly, and not for casual users", "Author": "Silea", "ReviewID": "R38X2894Q3OPJX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Other reviewers really cover the major features and problems with this product, so i'll keep mine short: unless you can sling IT jargon like a pro, you'll tear your hair out trying to install this.

Looking over the camera you get a manual focus ring, pinhole mic, power jack, Ethernet jack, speaker jack, WPS button, reset pinhole, USB slot with dismount button, 6 IR LEDs, and operational indicator LEDs.The first problem I had was messing around with the mount. It is several pieces and it takes a bit of fumbling around with to get it where you want it. You have to work around the Wi-Fi antenna as well as it sticks out right beside where the mount attaches to the camera.The included PC software is not intuitive to use and I could not get it to work right. I downloaded the version posted on the Mace website as well and still had no luck with it.I went to the Mace website to look for any firmware upgrades that may be available. There were none. I contacted support through their web portal and asked if there were any firmware updates or updates to the EasyWatchIP software. They did reply and said there were none. It is going on close to a year that Amazon has had the product available. The lack of firmware or software updates concerns me.  The company support did reply to my one question but I keep getting the impression of there being the possibility of no firmware development for this device in its future which is a major concern of mine. I also recently misplaced the manual. I checked the website and there is no manual posted for the camera, just a datasheet PDF.I had no problems setting up the camera on my network. I connected it to my WNDR3700 with WPA2-PSK AES and I configured a static IP and setup DDNS without a problem. UPNP is supported. You can choose to turn off the LED indicators on the camera so it operates in a less visible state. You can configure event notifications with FTP, Email, samba, IM, and Picasa image pushes. Motion detection can be configured using 3 zones that you can configure the size and shape of. You can then set the sensitivity on each.I use the IP Cam Viewer program from the marketplace on my Android and had it run a scan. It hit on Fitvision and when I configure the camera as a Fitvision CS1300 it works on my cell. The best I can tell is that this might be a camera produced by Fitvision because it looks a lot like some of the CS1000 series cameras on their site.The sound from the mic sounds about like what you would expect from a pinhole mic. It isn't crystal clear but good enough for getting general sounds. I think the video leaves a bit to be desired. The camera outputs SXGA. The video is grainy in normal indoor lighting. The IR LEDs light up a small room OK. The lens seems to get a lot of glare on it from lights in the room. You also get a very narrow field of view. Comparing the video to that of my Foscam FI8198W I don't think the Foscam is too far behind for not being HD. I get a wider field of view, don't notice the glare,  and better night vision from the Foscam. The Mace does have a little more detail but not much. Not $200 more detail at that. It is kind of disappointing.If you find a discounted price on the camera and can live without good firmware support the camera might make a good baby monitor for you. Otherwise I would say pass as I can't see any value here considering the lackluster video performance, lack of firmware updates, and high price.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.00", "Features": "Connect it: One-touch WPS wireless network setup; 802.11 b/g/n wireless; 10/100 Mbps wired; 3GPP/RTSP mobile\nUse it: Internet web browser accessible and smartphone remote viewing; powerful CMS software for multi-camera management with NVR recording; two-way audio ready; local USB alarm recording; FTP or email to external site\nWatch it: True 720p HD resolution; 1.3 megapixel sensor; 5.0mm megapixel lens; short range indoor IR night-vision up to 15ft (5m) max distance\nIncludes HD Megapixel Wireless Network Surveillance Camera with wall or ceiling mount camera bracket, 100/240V AC power adapter 5ft (1.5m), RJ-45 ethernet cable 6ft (1.8m), installation CD-ROM and user guide\nMace Security 12-month limited product warranty with USA-based, toll-free telephone technical support", "Name": "Mace Security EWIP-CAM-WIFI Easy Watch IP HD Megapixel Wireless Network Surveillance Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31d3YQsJmeL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005MCXJHM"}}
