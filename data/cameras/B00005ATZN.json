I've been impressed by the ease of use, the quality of the images, and variety of features. The only downside is that the 8 MB Compact Flash card which is included is insufficent; you will need to buy more memory, so budget accordingly. I'm somewhat tech-savvy so the S300 presented no problems in terms of getting up and running. I was able to intuitively grasp how to use most features without reading the manual. Those wanting or need to read the manual will find it understandable and well-written.There are several settings which determine the size and quality of the images. On the best settings (which is why you'll need more memory), the quality is excellent for on screen display. I've not printed any pictures yet, so I don't know about that. This is a 2.11 megapixel camera, so there are cameras out there with better image quality. That said, none are this small or ease to carry around.The S300 camera has a variety of shooting modes: auto, manual, stitch assist, and movie. You can also set the white balance so that you're shooting in black-and-white. The auto mode takes good shots under most conditions. I've not played enough with the manual mode to comment on it. The stitch assist, which allows you to create panoramic shots, is amazing when used in conjunction with the included computer software (in my case on a Mac). It'll put everything together and you can even save as a QuickTime VR if you have the appropriate software. The movie mode shoots at 20 frames per second and includes audio. The image quality is acceptable, but the audio is weak. The included Macintosh software (it comes with Windows versions as well) consists of an image database, an image editor, a video editor, a photo stitch assistant, and a camera remote control program. Excellent stuff, all.You have two ways to get images into your computer: Via the included USB cable  or by using an optional Compact Flash PCMIA adapter (cost: about $10). The USB cable, at least on the Mac, works great, though I suspect the download of lots of images from the camera would take a minute or two. I'm ordering a CF PCMIA adapter.As I mentioned, the 8 MB Compact Flash memory really isn't enough. At best quality the camera holds 7 images before running out of space. With 128 MB (which is what I've ordered) it will hold 128 images. Movie times face similar constrains.That aside, overall Canon has succeeded in delivering point-and-shoot ease-of-use to a digital camera. The S300 is small enough to take anywhere, and the result is that any moment becomes a photo opportunity. Users adept with Adobe Photoshop will find that a camera like the S300 allows any image at any time to become part of their digital world, and if that's not bound to enhance creativity, I don't know what will.

I have not been disappointed. The camera looks so sleek and small that people around you invariably comment on it. The buttons are intuitive and the small screen is incredibly sharp. I have a coolpix 950 at work and I can't believe it but the images off the s300 are sharper and the tones are more precise. In adddition the canon lenses are superior to Sony and Olympus  and are rivaled only by larger Nikon cameras. My only regret is that the camera does not come in a 3 megapixel variety, but realistically, one almost never needs 3 megapixels for home use anyway. 8 x 10s are sharp and beautiful on the s300 using maximum pixelation and superfine mode. Needless to say a 128 mb CF card is a must. The 8 mb card this comes with is a joke! Also, if you use the display to shoot images and not the viewfinder you will need a spare battery. One more point; the s100 case does not fit this camera; canon makes a hard to find PSC 300 case for this camera which fits well, although it adds a tad too much bulk. Neverthelesss, you should get it otherwise the metal will scratch. I found the case, a battery, and a neck strap. My wife, who is not tech savvy, also loves this camera for it's size and ease of use.  Although pricey, I think this camera is exceptionally well made and designed and worth the investment. All in all this is the hottest digital camera out there for good reasons: size and outstanding images!", "Date": "June 16, 2001"}, {"Title": "Superb Camera, great choice for every level of photographer", "Author": "Kapil", "ReviewID": "RPH21WHN7BIDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Canon S300 (IXUS) from May 2001. It has been a great month taking over 400 pictures on holiday and then back home. All my pictures are exceptionally crisp and clear with many taken with flash and indoors. And this is without even using it at the highest resolution. The short review is, if you need a digital camera, buy this one and live happily ever after.I spent over 1 month doing research on the net before finally deciding which camera to buy. The tough choice was buying the Canon even though it was only a 2.1 MP resolution. You can buy a Sony or Fuji or other 3.34 MP camera for similar price. BUT DON'T. The biggest advantage is size and speed of use. You will alway be able to have this midget camera in a pocket near you. It is superbly designed and crafted. While it does not have any manual capabilities (some minimum features) it is rare to require them in normal use.The useful features are the movie mode and simple panorama shooting. The software with the camera is quick and easy to use with minimum fuss. Obviously the USB connection makes life simple and quick. The Zoombrowser software has a great feature to make emailing pictures a breeze as you can choose the compression level as you go along.The battery life is decent though you should get the AC power adapter and a bigger memory card. The Sandisk 128 MB card was for about US$ 100 and will give you more than enough space to enjoy taking pictures and video. The greatest joy of going digital is the ability to keep on clicking and never worry about the cost. I can happily let my kids click away without any concern.I have had prints made (4 * 6 in) from the images and they are amazing even at medium resolution and fine setting. I don't know about larger sizes but for home use they are perfect.The only few points on the downside for this camera.1. No power indicator on the battery life. You only know its over when it starts to die completely2. Its not 3.34 MP resolution (at this price it would have been nice though not required)3. Its not cheap as a choice (good things never are I guess)Finally, the joy is in the jealous looks and envious comments you get whenever you pull out this stunning camera. It is an exceptionally good camera and you will have no regrets.

My priorities included at least 2.1 Mp which is necessary if you are going to have high quality prints made, compact size, ease of use (it's no fun if I'm the only one in my family that can take pictures), and optical zoom.  This camera fits all criteria perfectly.  A little pricey, but the picture quality is outstanding compared to other digital camera pics I have seen.  Only complaint is there is no battery life indicator until the charge is almost gone.  For this reason, an extra battery is a must, but I would skip the AC Adapter.  Buy a Compact Flash card reader instead and download your pictures directly from the CF Card.  Easier and cheaper to do it this way.  I thought the battery charger design was clever and compact also.  I have uploaded pictures to have prints made and they are very sharp, crisp and bright.  Much better than my old film point and shoot camera.  Also recommend buying a larger capacity CF card, so you can take full advantage of the best quality pictures this camera can take.", "Date": "May 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "\"bayareacashopper\"", "ReviewID": "R193KE6EA8D0J0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used a Canon 35mm for years and the reviews of the Canon digital ELPHs are great, so I decided to make my first digital a Canon S300.  My biggest concerns were pixels/resolution and camera size/portability.  This camera is teensy!  It easily can be carried around all day in a small camera bag and never is cumbersome or heavy.  The wrist strap that comes with it is very handy, too.It is extremely easy to use, especially if you take the time to read through the manual (which I did and saved myself a lot of trial and error time).  It does not have as many manual features as some larger cameras, but for someone that wants the ease of an automatic as well as the ability to change lighting and resolution settings, it is great.  The buttons are better situated and slightly larger and easier to use than those on the S110 which is currently the same price as the S300.  The S300 also has a 3x optical zoom vs. the 2x on the S110.The camera comes with a rechargeable battery and charger, but if you plan to take a lot of photos and use the LCD screen, you will want a backup battery.  These are pricey because only Canon makes them (had to get mine from a camera shop) but they are tiny, come with a protective case and take a full charge in just over an hour.  With the LCD screen on, the battery lasts a little over an hour.I would also recommend a flash card with a large memory.  I got a 128mb CF card and have taken nearly 500 photos and still have room on it.  I would suggest at least a 64mb.  The camera doesn't come with a case, something you definitely will want.  I got the smallest one CaseLogic makes that would fit the camera (which is built like a little tank and very sturdy!)  I also picked up a lint free cloth specially made for cleaning digital cameras - something I would not have thought of had I not read the manual which says NEVER use any type of liquid or fluid to clean the lens or camera as it can damage the camera.The clarity of the photos on the LCD screen is incredible!  I am so impressed with the technology that has gone into this little jewel.  And having the freedom to take unlimited shots is quite liberating - I am discovering there is a photographer in me just waiting to get out!  I got a CF card scanner to hook to the USB port on my PC and was able to transfer all the photos I have taken to a zip disk in minutes.  The photos are fantastic - great color, detail and resolution.  As for printed photos, so far I have not printed any so cannot say but this camera is perfect for sending digital images.All in all, I am very pleased!  The only change I would make to this camera would be to add attachment rings for a neck strap as there is no easy way to put a neck strap on this camera.  Otherwise, is just about perfect.", "Date": "November 27, 2001"}, {"Title": "Is the Movie mode worth it?", "Author": "Trip Hosley \"Restaurant Owner\"", "ReviewID": "R3O2HN7NHY2BJ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, let me start by saying I love this camera, I got it when it first came out and have been using it for several months.  Over all it is a great balance of size/ simplicity and quality (both images and workmanship)  I have printed 100's of photo's mostly snapshots of friends etc. and images captured on the highest setting make great 8X10 prints.The Video mode is very \"cool\" but after several months I have a ton of 20sec clips of people saying \"Hi!\" and waving.  Although the feature was helpful for some video walkthroughs of restaurants (work) as well as for an insurance claim, think twice about how much you will use the movie feature, before shelling out the extra cash. The s100 is considerably smaller and less expensive, the s300 is just a bit too big to throw in the front pocket of your jeans and take everywhere, so if you don't need the video mode or the extra zoom, buy the other camera.  My best friend has the s100, and I find myself leaving my camera at home and bringing my 128 card and battery to extend the life of his camera, instead of carrying mine.  Again this is a great camera, I am just spoiled by access to both models.  I take primarily pictures of people and am much more into \"gear\" than photography, so now that I bought the camera, it is time to learn to take pictures.  If you are looking for an alternative to point and shoot cameras, or what I was using... Disposables!  You will love this camera, it is packed with features, while still easy to get started with.  So if the Video, 3x zoom and black white are features you need, go with the larger s300, if not stick to the s100. Either way you will love the Cannon Digital Elf.Recommended accessories:1) Larger flash card (MUST HAVE) the 8mg is an insulting joke, what good is a $700 camera that can only take 8 photos as purchased, no card at all would be better at least you would know you needed to buy another.  I bought the 128, I usually run out of batteries before space.2) USB flash card reader, for about $30 is makes getting the pics on your machine a snap, and makes it easier to use other photo software.3) Extra battery, I have finally begun to take pictures with the view lens instead of the screen, but the extra battery is still nice to have because everyone wants to see the pictures and that chews up the battery.4) iPaq, ok so not really an accessory, but a fun way to see the pic's with a flash card reader, I wouldn't suggest that you buy and iPaq specifically for this purpose but if you already own one it is a fun way to show the pictures, without killing the camera battery, and an easy way to transfer digital images from the card using a familiar interface.", "Date": "November 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Outstanding point and shoot, with a few minor flaws", "Author": "\"minnesotan\"", "ReviewID": "R1SFI444W2S9CV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the camera for a week now; here are some observations.Like - true \"pocket\" camera - resolution is fine for 8x10 prints - most of my pics ~800K at highest res, so 128MB card fits 150-160 shots - automatic lens cover - movie mode (I'll stop carrying my Sony-cam everywhere) - battery life is fantastic - over 150 shots this week and I'm still on the original charge (~half have been flash)Dislikes - No case included with \"kit\"- unable to put UV/scratch-protecting filter on lens - CompactFlash card literally \"pops out\" when you press button; in my case flying 2 feet across the kitchen counter - flash photos not as good as our CoolPix 950; I'm not a propeller-head, but I'd guess S300's flash is not as powerful - zoom is not as smooth as our CoolPixOverall Great point and shoot, but not a replacement for a CoolPix if you take photography at all beyond \"point and shoot.\"", "Date": "May 15, 2001"}, {"Title": "Instant gratification", "Author": "David A. Biegel", "ReviewID": "RAWYDSV2D4H81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My biggest question before buying this camera was whether I could live with the photo quality. I could have bought a digital camera of comparable price with far better resolution and more professional functions. However, I could not find a camera that comes close to the size of the S300, which really is the best thing about this camera. It is small enough that you will not hesitate to bring it out with you on everyday events. Thus, you will find yourself capturing events in your life that might have been missed had the camera been too cumbersome. When I downloaded the photos to my Mac, I was actually quite satisfied with the photo quality. The medium range photos are particularly good, and I took a number of pictures in a dark bar that turned out great. No, they are not mind blowing, but the great content I have captured, which I probably wouldn't have with a bigger camera, far outweighs the fact that the resolution isn't a bit higher. And just to reiterate, the photo quality was my biggest worry, and I was not let down.Also, the movie feature in incredibly cool. They are a touch grainy, but they kind of have that old school 8 mm quality, which I actually like. I shot some movie clips at night while walking down a dark sidewalk and they turned out great. The ability to view your movies and photos on TV is also an underrated function. Connecting to you TV is supereasy (just plug the camera into the video port with the included cable). And watching the mini-movies you make is a kick- sound and all.This camera is incredibly easy to use, and its functions are very well designed. After a few hours you should be fairly adept at flipping through the various menus. I just purchased this camera so I cannot comment on its reliability, but everything has worked perfectly so far. I have to say this is one of the coolest toys I've bought, and I have bought a lot of them. The fact that I can take unlimited pictures for a next-to-nothing cost is the greatest thing about digital cameras. You should be able to store about 650 photos at maximum resolution on a CDR for about [amt]. Everybody complains about the short battery life. It really isn't that short, particularly if you don't use the display too much. However, you won't want to have to worry about running out of juice so I recommend an extra battery. Just to give you an idea, a fully charged battery lasted me about 1.5 hours while constantly taking photos and using the display. I thought I could live without an extra battery, but one day's use and I have changed my mind. One other thing you should know. I paid [amt.] for mine. Also, apparently there is an international model (with the same model number) that is not as well built and sells for a little less- at least, that is what I was told by one of these on-line electronics companies. I don't know what the technical differences are between the US and international model are, but it is something to look out for.", "Date": "August 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Size, picture quality, and video - Wow!", "Author": "Kent Schumann", "ReviewID": "R25OG302OCF79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I convinced my wife that we \"needed\" to spend more money on a video camera setup, and finally stop using our traditional cameras, she was skeptical.  I promised her that we'd take more pictures if we had a digital camera.  Once she agreed to the purchase, she warned me that we'd better actually use it a lot more than our traditional camera.So I searched high and low for all types of cameras and finally found the S300.  I was originally drawn to it for it's size - I can slip it in my pants or coat pocket whenever I want.  The size really makes all the difference because we've now used it 20 times more than our traditional camera due to the convenience.Our old camera wasn't huge, but it wouldn't fit in my pocket (and didn't fit easily in many of my wife's purses).  So we'd leave it at home (or in the car) on many occasions.  With the S300, it comes with us anywhere and everywhere.But here's where it gets good:  we've been amazed at how the picture quality is and how much fun it is to take small video clips (with sound) on this tiny device.  I'm no expert photographer, but I do enjoy being to have some amount of manual control for certain shots, and it gives me just the right amount of control, if I want it.  And the panoramic feature is really awesome - not something you can't live without, but impressive when you use it.Here are the only cons that I can think of (but none of them are bad enough to avoid the product, merely for information):1) Battery could last longer (we bought a spare and use it often)2) 8MB card is worthless, so just make it easy and buy a 256MB card - you'll never run out of room even if you take bunches of video3) Flash could be a bit brighter to cover more area.  It gets great flash pictures in a close area, but at a distance it gets very dark.4) It takes a little while to process one picture before it's ready to take the next one.  The delay can be annoying at times when you want to take a picture immediately after taking one.5) 3X optical zoom is among the best available, however, I crave more zoom power.  If I didn't want the small size of the S300, I would have gotten a bulky camera that does 10X optical zoom.6) The camera has a special light that flickers before taking a picture to determine distance, lighting, etc.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to turn off this light, even when the flash is turned off.  So you can't use the camera in a dark place where a small stray blue light will disturb others.That's it.  I'd recommend everyone buy one of these.  I thought that I might want to eventually get a higher mega-pixel camera, but I've compared pictures with other cameras and I don't notice any difference until after 8x10 size pictures (which we rarely print out).Kent", "Date": "February 13, 2002"}, {"Title": "It's Small, Small, Small, Great, Did I Mention Small ?", "Author": "J \"AGeorgiaEngineer\"", "ReviewID": "R1L9U8IA97F8VW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've read most of the reviews on this camera before I bought it.  I wont give an extremely long drawn out hypertechnical review here. What often gets lost in these reviews is the most important aspect of this camera:  it's small.  What's so important about small ?  Well, small is everything.  With a camera this small, it fits in your pocket.  If the choice is between carrying around a normal sized camera or taking one of these babies in your pocket, there's no comparison.  I bought mine a few months back and have spent the summer with it in my pocket wherever I go.  Little league ball games.  Vacations.  Wherever.On the technical side, the camera takes outstanding pictures.  It's a 2.1 Megapixel (1600 X 1200 pixel) camera, so it's not on the leading edge (3 megapixels have been out a while now).  But  2 megapixels are plenty.  This is more than twice what you need for a sharp display on a computer monitor or to print out an 8\" X 11\" photo on a printer.  The camera comes with a puny 8MB compact flash card, so I'd suggest you pick up a 64MB or 128MB card to store pictures.  Figure you'll store 2 to 3 pictures per MB, so 64MB will store over 128 pictures and a 128MB will store over 256 pictures.  A 64 MB card will cost you...Pros ---- Compared to my Epson PhotoPC750 (1 Megapixel, circa 1998), this camera excels in quite a few areas.  It has a jog dial on the top which is very handy to allow you to choose various modes (playback, manual, automatic, movie).  The camera is very quick (few seconds) between modes (the Epson took close to 5 seconds - extremely annoying).  The controls are much easier to navigate on this camera than the Epson.  The 3X Zoom on the camera is a really nice addition (forget about digital zoom...), and I like how the zoom button slides from optical into digital zoom when the optical is exhausted.  The cartridge battery on the camera lasts longer than I'd expected from the reviews, and is more of a snap to load and charge than the Epson individual batteries were.  I find night shots of the camera work a lot better as well.  I haven't used the movie mode that much so I cannot comment on it too heavily, other than it's use is limited since you can only take small ( less than 30sec) movies.Cons ---- No AC adapter is Supplied.

The original S100 was very intriguing - it's small, metal case and good mid-level resolution made for home/hobby use. However, when I discovered on Canon's Japanese web site that they were introducing a newer model I couldn't wait to check it out. Main differences are the increased zoom capabilities (3x via the lens and 2x by digital extension) and the video capabilities. I've had the camera for a couple of weeks and I've been very pleased with it's wide range of functionality in such a small package. It's got traditional point and shoot photo taking and automatic flash (with anti red eye). Multiple levels of resolution and digital compression. You can take multiple photos of different parts of a panoramic scene and the software that runs on your computer can automatically figure our how to stich them together (including full 360 degree view for virtual reality views) for one big wide photo! The ability to capture short movies is great fun - 25-30 seconds for smallest window is actually quite useful, especially if you plan to build a family web site and don't want to deal with full video editing with digital video cameras. Bundled software works great and is fast, includes quick resize, reorientation, color/brightness adjustments, etc. Very fast download speeds via USB connection and the bundled software that supports PC and Mac (I use it with an iBook and iMac with no problems - except doesn't work too well using MacOS X in Classic mode). I recommend buying the biggest CompactFlash card you can afford (I have the 256MB card!!) and you'll have much more capacity to enjoy the full features of this wonderful camera. Also, I recommend buying an additional battery so you can continue using the camera even while recharging the spare.

My wish list for the S100 included a more powerful zoom, stronger flash, more manual control, and the ability to do video clips.  Well, 2-1/2 out of 4 was good enough for me to switch:  the 3x zoom is great (especially compared to the 2x of the S100) and all I really need, basically the same as my 35-mm point-and-shoot.  The video feature is REALLY cool, and I feel the criticism about the short video-clip times is, for the most part, unwarranted.  Instead, it makes one THINK about what you're shooting, quite like the \"good old days\" of the 8mm films, when we made every frame count and didn't let cameras run ad nauseum, churning out many minutes of vdeotape that no one would ever watch.  The sound is very good (although mono) and the microphone must have excellent sensitivity.  There is slightly better manual control, in the respect that it's more convenient and quicker to use, but it's still just exposure compensation, white balance, and flash configuration, so \"manual control\" hardly seems to be the correct term to use in describing what is very much a point-and-shoot camera.  I still long for SOME ability to directly alter the aperture and shutter speed.  The flash remains weak---you MUST get close (8 ft or less) when using the flash.  As long as you do get that close, the exposures, even on Auto Everything, are excellent.  All that being said, let's face it---virtually all of us got this camera (or one of its cousins) because of its SIZE, or lack of it, and I can't stress enough the old saw that you won't get pictures if you don't have the camera with you.  The fact that it's not perfect won't take that away, and I have the camera with me wherever I go.  As with other reviewers, I will remind the readers that a second battery is basically mandatory, as is a larger CF card---MUCH larger!

We get about 100 photos on the factory default image settings, 1600x1200 and Fine resolution.  That works well even for our new parent photo appetite.A couple extra points, after having this camera for about a week, I dropped it on a tile floor Ouch! and it landed on the extended zoom lense Ouch! Ouch!  That's a feeling I never want to relive, but... Although the inner most part of the zoom was jammed against the outer barrel, I gently dislogged it, turned the camera on and off a couple times to get the lense to retract and extend.  The camera issued an error code once, before the lense had fully readjusted, but since then it has been working perfectly.  I consider it to be pretty rugged despite it's small size.  I suggest using the included wrist strap.  Before this incident I had mostly used it as a convenient way to pull the camera out of my pocket.I like the automatic lense cover, the panorama feature works well and is fun to play with, the movie feature is a lot more useful than I expected, the clips are of good quality, and are convienient to put on a web page or e-mail someone with broadband  net access.  We have a digital camcorder, but this is more convenient for web clips.  3X zoom is something I would not be without now that I've used it.  Sometimes it's not convenient to get closer to your subject.I was concerned that I might be overpaying, especially vs the new  S110 which has most of the same features, other than the zoom, but I can say I have been very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "July 17, 2001"}, {"Title": "Don't leave home without it", "Author": "Lawrence Charters \"-- Lawrence\"", "ReviewID": "R26SQ3CELEAWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Probably the best compromise between power and portability, the Canon PowerShot S300 Digital Elph (OK, so the name is silly) is an outstanding camera.

We actually gave this as a Hannukah gift to three different people.Definitely get a second battery, as well as TWO big memory chips. They really don't cost THAT much, and you shouldn't limit yourself to harsh compression or low resolution just because you don't have enough space. 1 Meg pictures will seem small two years from now anyway. I bought two 128 Meg chips, they give me all the snapping space I need...Which brings me to the second point:You want the space, because you don't want to constantly look at every picture you've taken. It's tempting, and everyone will want to see the picture that was just taken on the very cool display. The problem is that it saps your battery life more than anything else. So either be a picture grinch, or buy a second battery, allowing everyone to editorialize...hey, it's supposed to be fun.The flash (in my humble opinion) is too strong for portraits and two-shots. It seems to wash people out, and throws terribly high-contrast shadows.My biggest gripe is the time it takes to auto-focus, white balance, and god knows what else it goes through before it finally shoots. I've missed numerous shots simply because the camera refused to snap, or took too long. In the beginning this is occasionally annoying, but once you become a proficient frequent user, this becomes a real issue.Overall, the camera is solid, and surprisingly heavy for an object as compact as this. I've dropped it a number of times, and it works just fine. I've even managed to dent the metal case without problems. If there was a case for it (one that could also fit the spare battery and CF chip) this wouldn't be an issue. Buy one.The software it comes with is good, but not fantastic. It is absolutely newbie-friendly, but once you've become a more advanced user you'll find it a little clumsy. WinXP is better any way, and renders their photo-browser software obsolete. The ability to stitch together pictures (like standing on a mountain and taking three or four snaps as you slowly turn) is very cool, and easy. Worth buying for that alone.Instead of the cable, think of getting a CF slot PCMCIA card while traveling with your laptop. Less [stuff] to lose, and you'll always know where your second CF Chip is.BOTTOM LINE: Thanks to this camera, I have graduated to advanced user status, and will be buying a more sophisticated product, while my fiancee takes full posession of this one.

It was too big and not quite advanced enough for my needs. Don't get me wrong, the DC240 is a good camera and is perfect for those of you that are new to the digital imaging field, but it just wasn't for me.I'd always heard that the Canon ELPHs were great for portability and their quality was usually above par. So, I started looking into them and the S300 really caught my eye. It has high-quality resolution and it's small enough to fit in the pocket of my cargo shorts/pants. Although, the price tag was a little hefty, I thought I would give it a shot due to the amount of positive things I've heard about it. I wasn't disappointed.The first thing I noticed when I removed the camera from its packaging was the rugged design. The entire camera is nearly completely encased in metal. Yes, folks, I'm talking real metal here. Not plastic, which shatters or cracks when dropped. The camera has a very solid-feeling design and I don't mean that it's necessarily \"heavy\".. I mean that when held in your hand, it feels as though it could take a good whack and keep on working... Which is good, considering that it doesn't come with any sort of case, just a wrist strap.The camera itself takes extremely crisp photography, which can be printed out into 8x10 inch prints, if you have a decent printer. And, thanks to the rechargable battery pack, you don't have to worry about shelling out cash every time you want to take some pictures.Overall, this is an excellent piece of equipment that will keep serving you for a long time. My only real complaint is that the memory card supplied with the camera (8MB) isn't worth a wooden nickel, as it only holds a few high-resolution photos. If I were you, I'd grab a 128MB card.

So I spent a month researching various digital cameras, in order to buy my first new camera in 14 years.  There were three reasons I chose the Canon S300 over the other ones I was considering.  First is size.  Smaller in this case is better = more likely for me to bring it with me.  Second was the mostly metal case.  I drop things.  Often.  So I wanted a camera with a sturdy case.  Third was the relative ease of use and no-brainer picture-taking.  Oh, and I liked the 3X optical zoom.I have had my camera for 6 months and have taken more than 400 pictures.

They add to the cost but will add even more value to your ownership experience.The only negative comments: because of it's small size the icons and buttons are a bit small and sometimes hard to differentiate, a problem that goes away as you become more familiar with the camera. Also I did have a problem with the recharger and made several attempts to contact Canon support. Major disappointment there....there is no one home!

I need to play with it a little more, but it seems to have everything I need.  The PhotoStitch mode is pretty neat too.  I took five pictures of the Chicago skyline in the PhotoStitch mode.  Using the software I created a great panorama in less then five minutes.  I had read in some other reviews that battery life is an issue.  I haven't invested in a second battery yet.  Right now one battery appears to be sufficient for me.  I use the viewfinder instead of the LCD to frame shots.  I'm sure that helps with battery life.

Yet, I found myself wishing I had a camera on so many occasions when I didn't have one along.  The digital Powershot Elph S-300 is so tiny, it is truly purse size, (fits in a small cigarette box size cell phone pouch), and is bound to be with you and ready to go all the time, whenever you happen upon an image you just must capture.I was hesitant to buy something as low res. as 2.1 megapixels, but find that for web work it is more than adequate, and I am able to get decent five by sevens on an ink jet printer.  The color is realistic indoors and out, and you can override some controls manually.  My only complaint is the short battery life- less then two hours.  Buy at least one extra battery and at least a 128 Compact Flash card and you should be all set.My next purchase will be a matching CP-10 printer, despite reviews that it does not produce great quality prints and is only capable of mini-prints.  This is the Polaroid of the future.  I can envision traveling in third world countries and being able to give smiling photo subjects a small print in exchange for being able to take their picture. It beats passing out dollar bills, as I have in past travels, and you can still do that, as well, if you are so inclined.  Without even having loaded the enclosed software that Canon bundles with the Elph 300, I was able to easily transfer the photos I'd taken from the CF card to a ZIP disk in Windows Explorer, from a CF card reader directly to the ZIP.

My low light pictures are generally within flash range to be clear (same for all point and shoot cams without manual control). Avoid taking moving subjects coz they turn out blurred most of the time.

Absolutely, crisp.  You don't even need to use the highest setting for crisp, clean photos that are 100% true-to-life.What really convinced me that I had a great camera was the consistent brightness of an LCD screen.  When you're taking a picture, you want to be able to look into that little TV screen and see exactly how your pictures will look once you press that button.  If the screen is dark, you generally can't adjust it using the \"brightness\" button; that just washes out the colors in the image.

My previous camera was the Ixus with APS film. I was upset with the fact that I cannot enlarge APS photos without some distortion, so a digtal camera with 2.1 mega pixels seemed just right. You cannot beat this camera for the price. I wouldn't pay the recommended retail price though, shop around and get a deal. Also, make sure you get a large flash card - at least 128 cos you're going to want to take LOADS of pix!! An extra battery is also an essential for any long day trips, the LCD really drains it. I was expecting a red cast to my photos (from the reviews I read), but I barely have to do any retouching at all in photoshop. The software which comes with the camera is brilliantly simple, so don't feel like you may be intimidated by complicated applications.

Biegel", "ReviewID": "RKUS3QK21SDKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My biggest question before buying this camera was whether I could live with the photo quality. I could have bought a digital camera of comparable price with far better resolution and more professional functions. However, I could not find a camera that comes close to the size of the S300, which really is the best thing about this camera. It is small enough that you will not hesitate to bring it out with you on everyday events. Thus, you will find yourself capturing events in your life that might have been missed had the camera been too cumbersome. When I downloaded the photos to my Mac, I was actually quite satisfied with the photo quality. The medium range photos are particularly good, and I took a number of pictures in a dark bar that turned out great. No, they are not mind blowing, but the great content I have captured, which I probably wouldn't have with a bigger camera, far outweighs the fact that the resolution isn't a bit higher. And just to reiterate, the photo quality was my biggest worry, and I was not let down.Also, the movie feature in incredibly cool. They are a touch grainy, but they kind of have that old school 8 mm quality, which I actually like. I shot some movie clips at night while walking down a dark sidewalk and they turned out great. The ability to view your movies and photos on TV is also an underrated function. Connecting to you TV is supereasy (just plug the camera into the video port with the included cable). And watching the mini-movies you make is a kick- sound and all.This camera is incredibly easy to use, and its functions are very well designed. After a few hours you should be fairly adept at flipping through the various menus. I just purchased this camera so I cannot comment on its reliability, but everything has worked perfectly so far. I have to say this is one of the coolest toys I've bought, and I have bought a lot of them. The fact that I can take unlimited pictures for a next-to-nothing cost is the greatest thing about digital cameras. You should be able to store about 650 photos at maximum resolution on a CDR for about $1.00. Everybody complains about the short battery life. It really isn't that short, particularly if you don't use the display too much. However, you won't want to have to worry about running out of juice so I recommend an extra battery. Just to give you an idea, a fully charged battery lasted me about 1.5 hours while constantly taking photos and using the display. I thought I could live without an extra battery, but one day's use and I have changed my mind. One other thing you should know. I paid $.... for mine not including tax. Also, apparently there is an international model (with the same model number) that is not as well built and sells for a little less- at least, that is what I was told by one of these on-line electronics companies. I don't know what the technical differences are between the US and international model, but it is something to look out for.", "Date": "August 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great work horse before you reach for your slr.", "Author": "Bob Brown", "ReviewID": "RG05NC1S0JO4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good camera, easy to use, handy.
