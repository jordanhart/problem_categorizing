Anderson \"Lightwing\"", "ReviewID": "R20GVHBCXAJIB5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little one is amazing. The shots are just amazing and fairly easy to achieve. It's light weight but not cheap feeling and perfect for taking up close and quick shots. There is a zoom and micro zoom feature and to tell you the truth I am still getting used to them but so far the shots done with these features are pretty stunning to say the least. I think if you keep in mind that it's a very casual camera you will be impressed with its professional features and pro shot capabilities. The 720p video just breathtaking and it really does add to how the shots come out as well, helping them to have crisp detailed lines. This is just an amazing camera and I am really impressed with the Panasonic Lumix line period. Overall I am over the top happy and satisfied with this little beauty and I would recommend it in a second flat without any hesitation.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quick camera for a mommy of 2 little boys.", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "R2KBEKJLPBYK2B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a quick camera that took pics of my two year old and newborn. My two year old is always being so cute and silly and I needed a camera that I could whip out and just \"click click click\". This camera is fast. Very cute too. Buttons are a little small. The pics are great though. Love the color of it. Fancy and expensive looking.Issue: I do have an issue with it once in a while freezing. I just take the battery out and pop it back in and then its perfect again but after only a month of having it (bought NEW) this should not be happening. Not sure if I'm going to return it yet or not though.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "BEAUTIFUL PICS!!!", "Author": "Mommy knows best...", "ReviewID": "R12DIZ9IY7BOM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my daughters 16th b-day and I <3 it!!!!
