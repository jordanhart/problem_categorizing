Fahner \"spasticblast5\"", "ReviewID": "RYKKUN7XN49PI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received mine for Christmas from my dad and stepmother, my dad being a professional photographer with a scrutiny for cameras. With the addition of a 128MB SD card, this camera holds hundreds of pictures even at the highest resolution. The 4x zoom is a nice feature and the motion video feature is nice too. I never really cared for the burst function which usually produces really blurry pictures. I have only two complaints- the shutter is slow, which is typical for most digital cameras and the batteries in mine are used up fast but that is because Vivitars have some of the best flashes- even my dad agrees on that one. For the batteries, try rechargeable NiMH batteries, they are about $20-25 for a pack and charger but I haven't yet regretted the purchase. Even Lithium and Titanium batteries are used up in my camera, which I don't my camera that often, last maybe a week. The USB sync is pretty fast and the pictures are pretty fine at the medium resolution. I have been a diehard 35mm SLR fan for years. But this simple digicam has seen more action in less than a month than my 35mm SLR (competely manual!!!) has seen in five months. This is great package for a camera- 3.3MP, 4x zoom & Adobe Image Ready for less than $150. I just wish I had a tripod now. Believe me, this was my favorite Christmas gift in a few years.

The Vivicam has settings for all kinds of lighting plus automatic. I took a close-up of an item that had the UPC label on it. I could read the upc bar code numbers on screen clear as can be. I strongly recommend Nickel Metal Hydrate rechargeable batteries and carry spares besides (2+2). Helps to turn screen displays off and manually turn off after you take your pictures - else set auto-off for less than 3 minutes.  Vivtar has great documentation at their web site.  This is my second Vivtar and I am well satisfied with the value.", "Date": "January 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "An \"ok\" Camera if you get it cheap!", "Author": "\"ondamtn\"", "ReviewID": "R2IAE4ZDG0G1N5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought one at Target for $88.  Not bad for a 3.3 mp camera.  But it is a cheapie ... cheap optics, cheap construction.  If you get a good price and go in knowing the limitations, probably an ok deal.  Close-ups suck, must be apx 24\" away or image is blurry.  The flash takes forever to recharge & washes out images when used.  If you want to take your SD memory card out to transfer images, you have to open your battery door & reset date/time each time.  If you're taking a pic in a even pretty good lighting setting you need to hold the camera perfectly still for quite a while or image will be blurry.  Don't try to review images on the nominally backlit display unless you are in a closet.  It's a battery hog, buy recharge-ables .. flash charges a bit faster with rechargables too.. Minimal onboard memory, you'll want to upgrade memory right away.  All in all it's ok for the price & pics are really good if taken outdoors during the day.", "Date": "March 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "great camera!", "Author": "Cherise", "ReviewID": "R2Y33R835DWN32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera less than a week ago and I love it. It takes great pictures, even close-up pictures without the flash whiting everything out. The camera has tons of features I haven't even begun to use but it's nice to know they are there. It is super easy to delete pictures and download pictures to your computer -- I didn't even have to download any drivers or software. The camera even takes video clips. My only complaints with this camera are that it eats batteries, but that is something you can expect with a lot of cameras. Also, it takes HUGE pictures, but that can be easily fixed with editing software. The case over the lens works well, and the camera even came with a black velvet camera case to help protect and maintain your camera.

The 3x digital zoom zooms to 3x, there is no in-between, no control at all over the zoom.  Over the last month, the zoom has worked sporadically--not working when I wanted and needed it the most.

A. Peterson \"Jessiap18\"", "ReviewID": "R19H4LB0LAWKOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first digital camera, bought when I was pregnant with my now 3 yr old son.  I got it because it was a good price... $77 at Target the day after Thanksgiving.  I never regretted going with a cheap one for one second!  My dad did a lot of research, and bought a more expensive one from National Camera that they recommended, and the picture quality didn't compare to what I got.  Mine was 10X better.  The zoom isn't great... I just cropped the pictures later instead of zooming because it usually would look better that way.  The only reason I am not still using this great camera- I let my mom take it to Mexico, and when I got it back, the pictures were all blurry.  I don't know what she did to it, but it had never had a problem in 2 1/2 years and after 1 week with her it didn't work, so I do not blame the camera at all.  It does go through batteries, but like others said, just buy the rechargable batteries.  They worked great!  And someone said they last a half a year... I am still using the AA ones I bought over 3 years ago, and they still last just as long, and get a lot of use between cameras and my sons toys.  My replacement camera was researched a lot more after seeing the poor quality a lot of other people end up with... I got a Canon PowerShot SD600 Elph 6 months ago... and am in love with that camera.  If you are looking for good pictures for a good price, this is definitely the right camera.  If you are willing to spend more, the Canon also does great video w/sound, and has replaced my video camera.  Both take great pictures, the canon just has more options.  In 6 months I have taken over 3000 pictures with this camera.  Most people call me obsessive with pictures, so both cameras have definitely been put to the test by me... and both have passed (my dads, and many others I have tried in stores... would never pass.)  My #1 recommendation is to go to the store and try them.  Look at the quality of the pictures you take, the type of memory card, how fast it takes pictures (or you might miss everything your kids do!), and what features it has.  Megapixels is really not important... unless you are planning on blowing it up beyond 8x10.  3 MP blows up to 8x10 with great quality, and getting a camera with higher really won't change that, unless you are going to be printing bigger.
