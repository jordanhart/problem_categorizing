Easton", "ReviewID": "R2B8GJWZQXTMB5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for a 4 yr old bc the barbie/disney kids cams dont have very big screens. At almost 2\" this one is big enough to see the pics and entertain.  Also the lense doesnt telescope out to be broken by a child and runs on AAAs so no playing w/ electric outlets to recharge.  For around $40 you get 5.1 MP and decent pic quality with a flash, imo much better than the kids cams for sale. Amazon free shipping came fast, in 3 days.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "not all that", "Author": "Melissa Lytle", "ReviewID": "R2O4VIL8NZZ2JN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "while I love how compact the camera is, it did not live up to my expectations picture wise.  Looking at the lcd screen while trying to take a picture is not possible, it is dark so you have to hope that you got the picture you want. this would be great as a first camera for a kid, but for an adult, it's not all that.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than my last vivicam, but it was also a little more... good deal for the price", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1RAULZXKVMFZ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I'm not exactly a power user or anything but I do like to take pictures of things that im selling and kids like to play with my stuff too.  for the cost it's definitely worth while.  I **DO** wish the quality was a little better, I have a smart phone and it takes about the same quality pictures, but upon reading more my cell phone has more MP than this.  but for having it be accessible and separate from my phone, i am pretty satisfied.  hope that helps out!", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "5.1 Megapixel resolution\nIt is antishake\nIncludes movie mode", "Name": "Vivitar Vivicam 5.1MP 1.8IN.
