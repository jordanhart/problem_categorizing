{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice quality IP CCTV with useful features", "Author": "Audun Taraldsen", "ReviewID": "R1HOSGS67QV69M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When our dog-sitter cancelled the day before Thanksgiving, my wife was really nervous about our new dog-sitter. I said a couple of security cameras would calm her nerves so I ordered 3 of the TP-LINK TL-SC3171G and installed one by the main door, one monitoring the hallway and one on the master bedroom. The setup was fairly easy once I switched from wireless to WiFi, set static IP addresses for each camera and opened port 8080, 8081 and 8082 in the firewall for remote access. I then downloaded apps for my Android tablet and iPhone. I also configure the cameras with motion detection and enabled both FTP and email. Now I get an email notification with an image attachment from my mycctv@gmail.com email account when something happens. Or, I can log on from a web browser or one of the apps to see the live feed. My wife was very happy with the setup as she could keep track of when the dog-sitter took the dogs for walks and when they were fed. Our holiday was saved.The quality of the camera is good and the quality of the video or images is very good. I have several professional CCTVs at works, and the 640x480 resolution of the TP-LINK TL-SC3171G is more than good enough for home use, but it is not high-definition. Then again, you do not need HD at home. The camera also has infrared so you will see things clearly at night. The camera makes a strange \"clunk\" sound when it changes from color to IR, but it is not annoying.I would recommend this camera to anyone who would like to set up a quality home CCTV network. With a baby on the way, I am probably going to use a couple of the cameras as baby monitors.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "good daytime image quality, poor nighttime image quality.", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2PAEDF9UKK3NB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Good:- This camera does have a good clear daytime image.- The camera has an alarm input - this allows you to connect it to yourhome alarm system so you can receive e-mails when your alarm is sounding, this isgreat for people who don't want to pay $30/month for home alarm monitoring.i did get this working and it works as advertised.- Tech support is responsive, they helped me when i had questions about the camerasconfiguration settings.The Bad:- poor nighttime image quality.- Poor documentation for alarm input feature.- This camera emits very strong Radio Frequency Interference (RFI),this interferes with anything nearby that uses radio waves, for example:i mounted my camera close to my garage door opener and my remote controlno longer worked unless i held it next to the opener, it use to work 5houses away. I returned the camera do to this issue.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "not convenient and hard to install", "Author": "LJ", "ReviewID": "RC4ER9NH4IXH9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i want to buy a surveillance camera that has WIFI so it would be easier for installation and no wires are needed.  But the disc that comes w this package is a mini disc that is not compatible w my computer.  Looks like a video recording disc.  So installing wifi is impossible and i tried to go on to their site, but that didn't help either.  product is useless.

I managed to detect the camera using my MacBook Pro, the provided ethernet cable (direct connection using link local) and the Bonjour capabilities of Safari. But when I tried to log in, the camera would not accept the default username and password (admin/admin). I assume the previous buyer set those to something different and did not bother to reset them back before returning it to the store. Inserting a clip in the reset hole and holding it for 10 seconds never put the camera back to factory settings so I could use the default username and password. After wasting some good two hours with it, I give up and plan to return it tomorrow.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004S9CFZ2"}}
